	<brief_title>Classification Ankle Injury Observed With X-ray Combined With Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study Intraarticular fracture rupture ligament around joint often occur ankle injury . Early correct treatment effectively help joint repair , reduce incidence serious complication . Ankle fracture one common orthopedic fracture . X-ray common method detect ankle injury , determine fracture site , type extent . However , X-ray difficult display ankle fracture , bone fragment , displacement , ligament injury , make accurate fracture classification formulate treatment program . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) clearly show ankle ligament , tendon , cartilage injury , advantageous diagnosis ligament injury ankle fracture , provide accurate image information . MRI provide accurate preoperative assessment clinical indicator rational formulation treatment program reduce complication . The observation ankle contusion observe MRI conducive analyze mechanism ankle joint injury . Therefore , X-ray combine MRI would perfectly verify soft tissue injury ankle fracture make effective surgical program . Adverse event Adverse event include incision pain , incision nonunion , ankle pain , peripheral nerve injury ankle joint , ankle joint inflammation , soft tissue injury . Severe adverse event event occur clinical trial , include require hospitalization , prolonged hospitalization , disability , inability work , life-threatening , fatality . If severe adverse event occur , investigator would report detail , include date occurrence measure take treat adverse event , principle investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open-access 1 . Case report form demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , drug allergy history , adverse event collect . 2 . Data process use Epidata software ( Epidata Association , Odense , Denmark ) , collate , record electronically . All data regard trial preserve First Hospital , Hebei Medical University , China . 3 . The electronic database statistically analyze professional statistician create outcome analysis report submit lead researcher .</detailed_description>
