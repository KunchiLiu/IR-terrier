	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect AZD8871 patient COPD . Adult male female patient moderate severe COPD , agree study , receive 3 treatment , i.e . 2 different dos AZD8871 placebo ( dummy medication contain drug ) day 2 week , random order . To make comparison AZD8871 placebo fair possible , study `` double blind . '' This mean neither patient study doctor know order 3 treatment give . This study include patient 40 80 year age . In total 42 patient participate study two study center United Kingdom Germany . The study total 12 visit patient span period 4 6 month . The study anticipate run approximately 8 month exceed 10 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof-of-concept , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 3-way , complete crossover William 's design , multiple dose study investigate efficacy , PK , safety , tolerability 2 dose level AZD8871 placebo , administer use dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) device daily , 2 week , patient moderate severe COPD . AZD8871 new chemical entity combine property LAMA LABA single molecule . AZD8871 develop inhaled long-acting bronchodilator maintenance treatment COPD . The objective study ass efficacy , safety PK AZD8871 14-day treatment period 2 different dos patient moderate severe COPD . The target population include male female ( non-childbearing potential ) adult patient clinical diagnosis moderate severe COPD . The crossover design choose avoid inter-patient variability optimize sample size . By randomly assign treatment sequence , difference baseline characteristic treatment group minimise . The inclusion placebo arm consider reliable method minimise patient Investigator bias . The propose dose level AZD8871 study 100 600 µg AZD8871 give inhalation daily 14 day single dose DPI . Doses select base safety , tolerability , PK pharmacodynamics ( PD ) information generate previous clinical trial AZD8871 . The wash-out period propose current study minimum 28 day 35 day order avoid carry effect period . The broad dose range select ( 6 fold range 100 600 µg ) chosen span likely therapeutic dose facilitate dose selection future study . Considering expected efficacy patient COPD available data date , anticipated benefit outweigh risk support continue investigation AZD8871 clinical study .</detailed_description>
