	<brief_summary>Toxic Shock Syndrome ( TSS ) severe condition high morbidity mortality result host overwhelm inflammatory response cytokine storm . Staphylococcal superantigen toxin main causative agent . Toxic shock syndrome toxin ( TSST-1 ) responsible almost menstruation associate 50 % case . There specific therapy . The Phase I study BioMed0713 demonstrate safety tolerability BioMed recombinant toxic shock syndrome toxin ( rTSST-1 ) Variant Vaccine healthy adult . The aim amendment demonstrate prolong safety BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine ass persistence antibody generate participant . The second aim study assess boosterability BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amendment rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine Phase 1 Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine develop Biomedizinische ForschungsgmbH one component polyvalent staphylococcal vaccine prevention toxic shock hyperimmunization donor production TSST-1 immunoglobulin . This prospective , single-blinded follow-up study safety immunogenicity BioMed rTSST1 Variant Vaccine compare adjuvant healthy adult . All subject receive 2 dos 100 ng rTSST-1 Variant Candidate Vaccine placebo ( Groups 1 - 6 ) follow single-blinded manner long-term immunogenicity 6 - 15 month last ( = second ) immunization gain data persistence TSST-1 Ab titer . As part study occur unblinding study subject , term Part B ( good discrimination double-blinded Part A ) . All participant invite blood withdrawal determine TSST-1 antibody . Independent TSST-1 Ab titer level , subject receive one booster immunization either accord former allocate dose ( group 4 : 3µg placebo , group 5 : 10 µg placebo , group 6 : 30 µg placebo ) 3µg placebo ( group 1 - 3 ) visit . Placebo administer accord former allocate dose . The treated subject stay two hour immunization department follow 6 month . Rationale reduce monitor immunization follow : The BioMed rTSST-1 Variant Vaccine demonstrate excellent local systemic tolerability safety absence adverse event classify clinically relevant conduct study . Therefore abnormal finding expect monitoring vaccinated subject immunization reduce two hour , three follow visit plan , 24h ( +-2 h ) , 28 day ( +-7 day ) 6 month ( +-28 day ) booster vaccination .</detailed_description>
