	<brief_summary>To address need affordable hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antiviral high barrier viral resistance strategy shorten current treatment duration , goal develop affordable therapeutic regimen prevent HCV entry/spread test efficacy inhibitor treat HCV infection . The investigator recently discover major cholesterol uptake receptor require HCV entry hepatocytes already FDA-approved drug inhibits cholesterol uptake receptor . Importantly drug also potently block HCV entry human liver cell cell culture small animal model . Further , look back people previously treat HCV infection , investigator find treatment response well ( i.e . large viral log reduction ) patient happen take ezetimibe ( EZE ) . Hence , objective study ass whether FDA-approved drug ( ezetimibe ) useful treatment chronic HCV . The investigator predict administer monotherapy ezetimibe reduce HCV viremia perhaps allow viral clearance include combination treatment regimens EZE increase HCV decline result faster viral clearance ( i.e . shorter/cheaper direct-acting antiviral [ DAA ] therapy ) . To test hypothesis , investigator execute follow aim : ( 1 ) Assess efficacy EZE monotherapy chronically HCV infect predict time cure ; ( 2 ) Assess efficacy EZE adjunct therapy chronically HCV infect patient undergo currently approve HCV DAA treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To address need affordable HCV antiviral high barrier viral resistance and/or strategy shorten current treatment duration , goal develop affordable therapeutic regimen prevent HCV entry/spread test efficacy inhibitor treat HCV infection . The investigator recently discover Niemann-Pick C1 Like-1 ( NPC1L1 ) cellular cholesterol uptake receptor require HCV entry hepatocytes ezetimibe , FDA-approved drug inhibits NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake potently block HCV entry human hepatoma cell human hepatocytes transplant urokinase-type plasminogen activator-severe combined immunodeficiency ( uPA-SCID ) mouse . Further , retrospective analysis National VA database use multivariable logistic regression model control age , sex , race , alcohol use , drug use , co-morbidities , investigator find HCV prevalence low ( p &lt; .001 ) interferon/ribavirin ( IFN/RBV ) treatment response well ( i.e . large viral log reduction ) patient take ezetimibe . Hence , specific objective application ass efficacy EZE treatment chronic HCV . Based preliminary vitro , vivo , clinical retrospective data HCV/DAA modeling , investigator hypothesize administer monotherapy EZE reduce HCV viremia perhaps allow viral clearance include combination treatment regimens EZE augment 2nd phase HCV decline result faster viral clearance ( i.e . shorter/cheaper DAA therapy ) . To test hypothesis , investigator execute follow aim : ( 1 ) Assess efficacy EZE monotherapy chronically HCV infect predict time cure ; ( 2 ) Assess efficacy EZE adjunct therapy chronically HCV infect patient undergo currently approve HCV DAA treatment .</detailed_description>
