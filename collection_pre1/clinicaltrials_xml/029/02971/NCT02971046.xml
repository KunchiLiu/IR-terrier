	<brief_title>Glutathione ( GSH ) Synthesis Healthy School-aged Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glutathione ( GSH ) important protect cell body . It make amino acid find protein obtain food eat . This antioxidant important protect cell body damage . Low level GSH find healthy person get enough protein diet . Inadequate protein intake child compromise growth , could increase susceptibility , compromise recovery regular childhood illness . Measurement GSH synthesis provide functional method whereby current protein recommendation test high estimate derive use IAAO method . The current dietary reference intake ( DRI ) recommendation protein child age 6-11 year base nitrogen balance data set mean ( EAR ) population safe ( RDA ) recommendation 0.76 0.95g.kg-1.d-1 respectively . Using indicator amino oxidation ( IAAO ) method estimate mean population safe protein requirement age group child 1.3 1.55g.kg-1.d-1 respectively.The purpose study therefore measure GSH synthesis school age child age 6-11 year response current recommend protein intake response protein requirement estimate derive use IAAO method .</detailed_description>
