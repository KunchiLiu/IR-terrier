	<brief_summary>Patients undergone gastrectomy ( removal stomach ) treat prevent cancer know significantly reduce quality life . To date , little information physiological cause . The investigator suspect overproduction hormone ( chemical ) call glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) release line gut may play role reduce appetite , weight loss low blood sugar symptom see group . To investigate , investigator study response 16 patient previously gastrectomy glucose drink , meal , receive infusion specific blocker GLP-1 placebo . The investigator examine level sugar associate hormone blood , food consumption food reward behaviour use standard tool . Participants invite attend Clinical Research Facility Addenbrooke 's Hospital screening visit , two whole day study visit . The study design assess role overproduction GLP-1 completely block action , rather assess use block compound medication , therefore regard physiological study , clinical trial . The goal study demonstrate magnitude effect GLP-1 blood sugar appetite derangement patient gastrectomy . This guide future work development novel treatment paradigms post-gastrectomy patient group .</brief_summary>
