	<brief_summary>Currently insufficient publish study amino acid requirement elderly . Phenylalanine one indispensable amino acid . Low level phenylalanine observe blood older adult . It due increase uptake liver intestine . This decreased level phenylalanine could lead decreased skeletal muscle protein synthesis . Requirement elderly individual set base study conduct young adult hence may inaccurate . The goal study directly measure phenylalanine requirement male female elderly subject 65 year use direct amino acid oxidation ( DAAO ) technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylalanine Requirement Adults &gt; 65 Years .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To determine compare phenylalanine requirement healthy elderly male female adult age 65 year use DAAO technique ( measure oxidation L- [ 1-13 C ] phenylalanine 13 CO 2 [ F 13 CO 2 ] ) response grade intake phenylalanine . 2 . To compare requirement derive young healthy adult previously determine lab .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Healthy elderly male female &gt; 65 year 2 . Willingness participate study complete screening procedure ( height , weight , fast blood sample medical history questionnaire ) . 3 .
