	<brief_title>Long-Term Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy DTX101 ( AAVrh10FIX ) Adults With Moderate/Severe Severe Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B X-linked recessive genetic bleeding disorder cause mutation factor IX ( FIX ) gene . FIX produce liver critical fibrin clot formation . Hemophilia B characterize frequent , spontaneous internal bleeding lead chronic arthropathy ( joint damage ) , intracranial hemorrhage , even death . In patient moderate/severe severe hemophilia B , majority bleed episode occur joint , treat , lead debilitating damage decrease quality life . Study 101HEMB02 long-term follow-up study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy AAVrh10-mediated gene therapy human FIX subject moderate/severe severe hemophilia B . The primary objective study determine long-term safety efficacy DTX101 follow single IV infusion ( administer Study 101HEMB01 ) adult moderate/severe severe hemophilia B .</detailed_description>
