	<brief_title>A Study Anti-PD-1 ( Pembrolizumab ) + Hormonal Therapy HR-positive Localized IBC Patients With Non-pCR Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 ( +/- 3 day ) 21-day cycle . Participant also receive hormonal therapy participant 's doctor choose participant 's standard treatment . The study doctor tell participant hormonal therapy participant receives , risk , often participant receive . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug 24 month , long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up visit ( describe ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - Participant physical exam - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Cycle 4 every 3 cycle ( Cycle 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 ) , participant imaging scan , include EKG either ECHO MUGA scan , check status disease part participant 's standard care . Also , blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw biomarker immune system test . This blood also draw disease appear get bad . Participant chest wall breast photo doctor think participant need . End-of-Treatment Visit : As soon possible participant stop receive study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 10 tablespoon ) draw routine , biomarker , immune system test . - Participant imaging scan participant screen check status disease . - If doctor think need , participant EKG either ECHO MUGA scan . Follow-Up : About 1 month last dose study drug , participant ask participant 's health side effect participant may . Participant may ask routine clinic visit participant may call . If participant call , call last 2 minute . If participant stop take study drug reason disease get bad , participant call 24 month participant 's first dose pembrolizumab learn participant . If participant call , last 3 minute . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic melanoma . Its use patient IBC combination standard hormonal therapy consider investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 37 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
