	<detailed_description>Patients sepsis receive inadequate AI regimen high risk poor clinical outcome . It therefore critical achieve adequate concentration AI quickly possible patient . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) describe drug concentration-time course body fluid result administration certain drug dose , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) observe effect result certain drug concentration . The three PK/PD index commonly evaluate AI : ratio maximal unbound drug concentration MIC ( fCmax/MIC ) , ratio area unbound drug concentration-time curve MIC ( fAUC/MIC ) percentage 24 h time period unbound drug concentration exceed MIC ( fT.MIC ) . Dosing regimen choose reach target value main PK/PD index . In hospitalized patient , high between-subject variability expect PK parameter , relate severity disease ( sepsis , neutropenia , organ failure ... ) , weight , age ( geriatric patient , neonate ... ) co-administration medication lead potential drug interaction . The PD variability strongly influence immune status , type infection , inoculum size , comorbidities . The optiPOP protocol aim define common framework PK/PD study conduct jointly Antimicrobial Stewardship Team Pharmacology department Cochin hospital . These study use mathematical population pharmacokinetic modeling methodology investigate PK/PD parameter various AI range specific study population ( ICU , neutropenic patients… ) . The effect covariates PK PD parameter investigate order well explain between-subject variability ultimately suggest individualized dosage regimen . OptiPOP prospective , non-interventional , single center study , base data regularly collect therapeutic drug monitoring AI . The antimicrobial stewardship team ( AST ) role advise clinician diagnostic treatment infectious disease . It closely involved daily therapeutic drug monitoring AI , collaboration department pharmacology . Patient selection take place medical surgical ward hospital . The AST senior physician check eligibility criterion propose study patient , accordance refer physician . Any adult patient require administration AI least one plasma concentration measurement conduct Cochin department pharmacology eligible . The AST physician give briefing note patient , non-oral opposition retrieval analysis data collect . No intervention charge make study . It plan include 60 patient per molecule .</detailed_description>
