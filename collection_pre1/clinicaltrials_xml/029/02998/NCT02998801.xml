	<brief_title>Alleviating Pre-operative Anxiety With Innovative 3D Immersive Virtual Reality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence pre-operative anxiety estimate high 80 % surgical population . Physiologically , may result high cortisol level , may slow heal recovery process . A multitude perioperative clinical trial reveal pre-operative anxiety associate reduce short-term postoperative recovery , increase pain score , nause &amp; vomiting , sleep disturbance , surgical wound infection , increase length stay , cardiac complication . It also link bad functional outcome quality life one-year surgery . Literature look factor associate preoperative anxiety outline general theme fear unknown distressing . Specifically , distress event seem wait collect surgery , wait outside operating room ( OR ) , transfer OR bed monitor oxygen mask apply . These moment prior surgery patient likely continuously ruminate 'what come next ' fact know - lead anxiety . One survey 161 patient present elective surgery inquire factor lead calm prior procedure find well informed pre-operative process critical aspect anxiety relief . Approaches implementation pre-anesthetic clinic ( PAC ) use videos expect lead surgery implement address issue costly mixed effect . Virtual reality ( VR ) technology present new educational opportunity patient effort reduce pre-operative anxiety . Through immersive 3D simulation , patient experience journey prepped surgery transfer OR . A patient learn pre-operative experience engage manner oppose passively read , watch video verbally teach healthcare provider . A patient educate perception physically present pre-operative experience day week prior OR date .</detailed_description>
