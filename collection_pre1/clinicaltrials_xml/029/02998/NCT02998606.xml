	<detailed_description>Background MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) alleviate adverse effect associate frequent opiate use . The GI system common site unintended effect opiate use , literature suggest peripherally act opioid agonist may provide relief instance GI dysfunction . ( Holzer 2007 ) Toxicology pharmacology summary 14 Phase I study complete 439 health volunteer participate . MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) test standard range safety pharmacology study include absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion study , QTc ( correct QT interval ) study , several PK ( pharmacokinetic ) study , study determine central peripheral pharmacodynamics effect . MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) metabolize primarily cytochrome P450 enzyme ( CYP ) -3A4 CYP3A5 substrate P-glycoprotein transporter . Drug-drug interaction study perform strong moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor , CYP3A5 inhibitor P-glycoprotein transporter inhibitor . Clinical Safety summary MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) initially test 439 healthy volunteer across 14 Phase I study . Ascending-dosing study perform first dose range 8-1000 mg , follow twice daily dose range 25-250 mg , administer intravenously . Another ascend dose study complete old volunteer ( age 65 old ) Japan determine effect advance age PK value . Phase IIb II study expose 1497 patient dosages range 5 mg 50 mg period time vary 24 52 week . MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) show acceptable safety profile well-tolerated 5 mg 25 mg . The 50 mg cohort show increased frequency GI adverse event ( abdominal pain , nausea diarrhea ) compare 25 mg 5 mg cohort . The 25 mg dose maximum use across 5 phase III study . Two 12 week placebo-controlled double-blind study complete confirm safety efficacy , well 12 week double-blind safety extension , randomize 52-week open-label parallel group , long-term safety study placebo-controlled , double-blind study patient cancer-related pain . The efficacy study demonstrate therapeutic effect MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) independent age , gender , race , body mass index , region , use anticholinergic , response previous laxative use , type opioid , dose opioid . Phase III study demonstrate MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) generally safe well tolerated dos 25 mg daily patient OIC ( opioid-induced constipation ) 52 week treatment . Acute chronic use opioids associate variety adverse effect gastrointestinal tract . The effect opioids gastric , small bowel , colonic motility well characterize . The main esophageal abnormality see impaired LES ( low esophageal sphincter ) relaxation . Recently large retrospective study assess effect opioids esophageal motility use , first time , HREM Chicago classification esophageal motility disorder v3.0 find Esophageal motor dysfunction common chronic opioid user whether studied opioids opioids . ( K raichely 2010 ) However , opioid use within 24 h manometry associate increase EGJ ( Esophagogastric junction ) outflow obstruction spastic esophageal motor abnormality . In addition , current opioid user also significantly high integrated relaxation pressure manometric pattern consistent type III achalasia . Benefit/risk ethical assessment Preliminary data suggest relationship opioid use esophageal dysfunction . The decline quality life associate esophageal disorder may discourage patient take opioids , subject unwarranted pain . MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) opioid antagonist specifically design work outside central nervous system . This allow relief undesired peripheral effect opioids without disrupt analgesic effect . The use MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) potential mediate esophageal dysfunction preserve vital pain relief . Patients MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) contraindicate exclude well take strong CYP3A4 inhibitor strong CYP3A4 inducer opioid antagonist . In Phase III study , adverse event abdominal pain ( 21 % v 7 % ) , diarrhea ( 9 % v 5 % ) , nausea ( 8 % v 5 % ) , flatulence ( 6 % v 3 % ) , vomit ( 5 % v 4 % ) , headache ( 4 % v 3 % ) , hyperhidrosis ( 3 % v &lt; 1 % ) observe great rate among 25 mg cohort compare placebo.. The current study design explore potential benefit effect Naloxegol upper GI motility clinical symptom inpatient receive opioid Study design This single center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study determine effect MOVANTIK™ ( Naloxegol ) opioid-related esophageal motility disorder .
