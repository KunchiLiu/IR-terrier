	<detailed_description>The study multicenter , open label Phase I trial . Phase 1 , dose-escalation : This study use 3+3 design estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . There 2 escalate dose level trial ( 0.5 μCi/kg 1 μCi/kg , ) . Each dose administer 4-8 cycle provide total dose receive per patient exceed 4 μCi/kg . De-escalation ( decrease dose level 0.25 μCi/kg ) plan first dose level 0.5 μCi/kg , expand cohort maximum 6 patient , ≥1/3 patient M protein decrease &gt; 10 % AND ≥2 patient DLTs . At dose level 0.25 μCi/kg , eligible continue receive additional dos study drug , patient receive 8 dos total , total administer activity 2 μCi/kg . The start dose level 0.5 μCi/kg 225Ac-Lintuzumab administer day 1 cycle . If dose level safe , second dose level 1 μCi/kg explore . If start dose level result DLTs ≥2 patient ≥1/3 patient M protein decrease &gt; 10 % , dose level 0.25 μCi/kg explore . Subjects receive investigational drug single infusion prescribe dose level . Intra cohort dose escalation/ decrease allow . Minimum three maximum six patient treat dose level , dose escalation proceed follow : 1. 1/3 patient M protein decrease &gt; 10 % Day 42 AND patient DLTs , redose dose level Day 60 ANC PLT count allow ; 2. 1 patient give dose level DLTs , expand cohort add 3 patient dose level . 3. 1/3 patient expand cohort exhibit DLTs , proceed next dose level . 4. first dose level , expand cohort maximum 6 patient .1/3 patient M protein decrease &gt; 10 % AND .2 patient DLTs , decrease dose level 0.25 uCi/kg 5. patient reduce dose level 0.25 uCi/kg M protein decrease &gt; 10 % AND 1 patient DLTs terminate trial 6. none patient DLTs give dose level , escalate next dose level . 7. 2 patient exhibit DLTs give dose level , previous dose level consider MTD . 8. 2/3 patient respond PR good &lt; 1/3 patient DLTs , complete Phase 1 portion dose level ( dose escalation ) . 9. patient least stable disease eligible receive additional cycle treatment Day 60 response status remain bad CR , continue receive repeat dos study drug every 60 day cycle 2 receive cumulative dose 4 ìCi/kg achieve CR , whichever sooner . All patient receive GCSF support start Day 9 continue ANC &gt; 1,000 . After dose escalation portion complete , treat 3 additional patient high establish dose level confirm MTD establish dose level MTD .</detailed_description>
