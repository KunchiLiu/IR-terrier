	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease chronic inflammatory disease gastrointestinal tract . Emerging evidence suggest microbiome play important role trigger abnormal mucosal immune response patient Crohn 's Disease . Independent study demonstrate imbalance microbiome significant increase E coli invasive property , term adherent-invasive E coli ( AIEC ) . These AIEC bacteria attach gut wall susceptible patient via fimbrial adhesion protein FimH , subsequently trigger inflammation invade proliferate within gut wall . EB8018 oral small molecule design block FimH thereby prevent entry AIEC gut wall thereby disarm bacteria without disrupt gut microbiome .</detailed_description>
