	<brief_title>An Exploration Outcomes Post-total Knee Arthroplasty Middle East</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project objective To gain understanding recovery post-TKA Saudi population explore whether factor help u understand patient outcomes successful identify prediction factor progression . It prospective study measure outcome six month post-TKA follow objective : - Examine internal consistency , reliability validity Arabic Version Oxford Knee Score total knee arthroplasty male female Middle East patient . - Examine test- re-test reliability Star Excursion Balance Test male female Middle Eastern patient . - Measure patient outcomes post-total knee arthroplasty use patient self-reporting activity measurement Arabic Version Oxford Knee Score ; - Evaluate physical activity level improvement post-knee arthroplasty use objective method accelerometer : ActivPAL ; - Assess functional recovery post-knee arthroplasty accord Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommendation use performance-based measurement , : 30 chair-stand test , stair-climb test , time up-and-go test 6 walk test alongside functional balance . The rationale lead project ; Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) major cause disability around world ; common chronic condition primary care UK . By 2030 predict great cause disability general population . An effective end-stage treatment knee OA knee-replacement surgery , first do 1970s 1980s . In England Wales , number knee-replacement procedure record National Joint Registry 2013 91,703 , represent increase 0.9 % 2012 . The data analysis National Joint Registry Office National Statistics suggest , 2030 , primary TKAs increase 117 % 2012 level . Subsequently , TKA revision surgery expect increase incrementally 332 % . There similar estimation demand revision TKA surgery United States ; 2030 , expect rise 601 % 2005 level . The United States estimation primary TKA growth 673 % 2005 level , similar England Wales 's upper-limit projection . Post-TKA , 75-85 % patient report satisfaction surgery outcomes , remain 15-25 % dissatisfied ( Klit , Jacobsen , Rosenlund , Sonne-Holm , &amp; Troelsen , 2014 ) . Total knee arthroplasty 's success traditionally evaluate surgeon 's perspective , e.g . presence surgical complication implant survival . This gradually change involve patient measure health outcome decision-making process . Patient-reported outcome measure ( PROMs ) evolve explore patient perspective monitor quality care health organization conduct clinical trial outcome . PROM result exclude Research Participant Effect ( RPE ) subjective over/underestimation due psychosocial effect pain joint , hip back . Hence , objective clinical evaluation method minimize patient ' subjective over/underestimations outcome , though RPE exclude . Objective assessment advantage PROMs , lack ceiling effect precision responsiveness , require cultural language adaptation . Performance-based Outcome Measures ( PBOMs ) advantage objective measure overlap pain measurement . They sensitive detect change , responsive , minimal ceiling effect feasible . PROMs PBOM measurement tool assess different aspect function post-TKA . PROMs mainly assess patient ' functional ability belief experience , objective functional assessment instrument PBOM measurement tool evaluate patient ' actual ability function . Therefore , conduct comprehensive functional assessment post-TKA , PROMs , objective functional assessment instrument PBM measurement tool recommend . To best knowledge , study explore outcome post TKA use PROMs , PBOMs functional balance measurement tool Saudi male female population explore possible accurate prediction factor outcomes post-TKA . Reliable outcome prediction could , however , improve patient selection surgery , appropriate timing surgery depend patient symptom efficient patient preparation surgery cost-effective . Accurate preoperative prediction crucial minimize potential unrealistic expectation outcomes . This study investigate outcome post-total knee arthroplasty factor may predict good/poor progression use three category outcome measurement order minimize subjective over/ underestimation surgical outcome . Thus , study seek explore accurate objective prediction factor post-total knee arthroplasty progression . Potentially , reliable outcome prediction could improve patient selection surgery , appropriate timing surgery depend patient ' symptom efficient patient preparation surgery , cost-effective . Accurate preoperative prediction crucial minimize potential unrealistic expectation outcome .</detailed_description>
