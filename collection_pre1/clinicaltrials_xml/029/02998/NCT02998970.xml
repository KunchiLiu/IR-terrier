	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect Empagliflozin cardiac structure , function circulate biomarkers patient Type II diabetes . Empagliflozin ( anti-hyperglycemic agent ) , approve Health Canada FDA treatment Type II diabetes , demonstrate reduction cardiovascular death heart failure previous post-marketing clinical trial . The use empagliflozin treat patient diabetes heart disease approve Health Canada . However , process may give beneficial effect remain unclear need investigation . Therefore , aim study provide fundamental understanding mechanistic basis Empagliflozin could provide potential cardio-protective effect employ use Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMRI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Empagliflozin Cardiac Structure Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence heart failure Canada high , affect 1-3 % total population , represent one health care system 's expensive diagnosis . Type 2 diabetes significant risk factor heart disease , presence type 2 diabetes heart disease increase risk major health complication include death . A translational study fundamental understanding potential mechanistic basis empagliflozin 's cardiac benefit . The study drug , empagliflozin ( market Jardiance ) , belong class medication lower blood glucose ( sugar ) prevent glucose enter back blood circulation ensure eliminate urine . It approve FDA Health Canada treatment type 2 diabetes . This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group phase IV study empagliflozin vs. placebo patient type 2 diabetes inadequate glycemic control high cardiovascular risk . The purpose good understand empagliflozin could potentially improve heart function use CMRI . Patients give informed consent undergo baseline CMRI randomly assign 1:1 basis either empagliflozin 10 mg daily ( OD ) match placebo . The aim study consent 90 eligible subject , follow 26 week . An end study CMRI perform 26 week . The study comprise 6 study visit enrol subject follow 6 month . The patient assess use CMRI , consider `` gold standard '' measuring leave ventricular ( LV ) volume , mass , ejection fraction . Patients undergo two CMRI examination : baseline 6 month surgery . In addition , investigator investigate change baseline LV end-diastolic volume , end-systolic volume , LV ejection fraction , regional LV diastolic systolic function , aortic pulse wave velocity distensibility ( measure arterial stiffness ) via CMR image patient type 2 diabetes treat empagliflozin compare receive placebo . Also , change baseline panel biomarkers involve pathophysiology heart evaluate baseline , 1 month 6 month , patient type 2 diabetes treat empagliflozin . Study assessments potential adverse event report undertaken study visit .</detailed_description>
