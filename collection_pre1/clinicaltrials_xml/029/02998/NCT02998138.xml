	<brief_title>Postoperative Chronic Pain Genetic Spine Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safe effective analgesia important unmet medical need child . Despite effort promote non-pharmacologic intervention , drug treatment remain standard care child experience severe pain follow surgery . Inadequate pain relief invasive surgery , side effect analgesic morphine occur frequently 50 % child . A study patient control analgesia ( PCA ) morphine use spine surgery adolescent observe 45 % incidence postoperative nausea vomit 7 % incidence respiratory depression . Presently , evidence-based dosing guideline opioid therapy ascertain pediatric patient population , remain trial error method . Despite aggressive pain management spine surgery , finding show neither child 's pain analgesic use diminish significantly time . As , critical knowledge gap medical literature significantly impact pediatric pain management . Moreover , chronic postsurgical pain ( CPSP , define pain attributable surgical procedure last 2 month surgery critically impact 13-30 % child surgery , lead chronic pain adult impose extraordinary annual cost health care system ( $ 560-635 billion ) . It recently show pain unpleasantness predicts transition acute moderate/severe persistent post-surgical pain , whereas anxiety sensitivity predict maintenance moderate/severe post-surgical pain 6 12 month surgery . Spine fusion adolescent particularly painful surgery 15 % incidence pain even 5 year surgery , hence serve good surgical model evaluate behavioral genetic predictor chronic postoperative pain . In recognition therapeutic challenge investigator plan evaluate determinant inter-individual difference opioid analgesic responsiveness , adverse effect , pain perception predictor chronic postoperative pain child .</detailed_description>
