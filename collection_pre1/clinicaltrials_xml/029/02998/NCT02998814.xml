	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate retention rate fissure sealant place use different adhesive protocol 24 months.Twenty-four subject restoration caries receive fissure sealant ( Clinpro™Sealant , 3M/ESPE ) place different adhesive protocol . A total 292 sealant ( 73 group ) place . The sealant place follow ; a-without adhesive ( acid-etch ) , b-with etch-and-rinse adhesive ( SingleBondTM ) , c-with self-etch adhesive ( AdperTMEasyBond ) , d-with acid-etch+self-etch adhesive ( AdperTMEasyBond ) two previously calibrate dentist use table random number . Two calibrated examiner , independently evaluate sealant baseline 6- , 12- , 18- , 24-month recall . Each sealant evaluate term caries formation present absent retention use follow criterion : 1=completely retain , 2=partial loss , 3=total loss . The Pearson χ2 test use evaluate difference retention rate among sealant evaluation period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental caries , encounter individual throughout life , one chronic diseases worldwide . Researches mainly focus prevention tooth caries awareness fact . The use fluorides well pit-and-fissure sealant common preventive application caries progression.Modern adhesive combine conventional conditioning , prim bond step ( etch-and-rinse adhesive ) together one two bottle ( self-etch adhesive ) ease adhesive protocol . However , still suspicious whether modern self-etch adhesive equal bonding capacity conventional etch-and-rinse system . Therefore , clinical trial necessary evaluate long-term adhesive performance self-etch adhesive compare conventional etch-and-rinse one .</detailed_description>
