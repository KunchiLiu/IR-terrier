	<brief_summary>Rationale : Lateral ankle ligament injury may result ankle sprain . In 10-30 % patient lateral ankle ligament injury , chronic lateral ankle instability may present . If conservative treatment fails , instability treat surgically . Anatomic repair ( also know Bröstrom procedure ) current golden standard surgical treatment chronic ankle instability . The Bröstrom start open technique also perform arthroscopically . Both approach consider standard care provide good result . Which approach best , yet research . In study hypothesize arthroscopic repair provide well functional outcome compare open repair short term follow-up . Objective : The main objective study compare functional outcome arthroscopic open anatomic repair patient chronic lateral ankle instability , secondly assess ankle stability ankle Range Motion ( ROM ) arthroscopic open ligament repair . Study design : A Non-Blinded Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Study population : All patient willing participate , age 18 year old , persist ankle instability least 6 month , eligible anatomic repair . Intervention : Both group patient surgically treated anatomic repair anterior talofibular ligament ( ATFL ) . One group treat arthroscopically open approach . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome measure functional outcome 6 month surgery measure use Foot Ankle Outcome Score . The main study parameter difference ≥10 2 point per FAOS subscale treatment group ( Minimal Important Change = 10 point ; 2 per subscale ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year old ; Experience pain and/or sensation instability sport and/or daily activity ; Isolated lateral ankle instability ; Planned surgical repair ATFL ; At least one previous episode ankle inversion sprain ; Complaints least 6 month ; Failed previous conservative treatment . Serious concomitant injury ( like arthrosis , rule use AP lateral xray accord standard protocol ) ; Foot ankle fracture past ; Previous foot ankle surgery ; ROM restriction &gt; 10 degree ; Medial instability ; Severe misalignment ; Ankle/foot deformity ( e.g . severe flat foot ) ; Systemic comorbidity lead delay recovery ( e.g . Diabetes Mellitus , Rheumatoid Arthritis ) ( general ) Hyper laxity Inability unwillingness provide consent Present factor may cause difficulty followup</criteria>
