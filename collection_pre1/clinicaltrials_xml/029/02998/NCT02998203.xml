	<detailed_description>A single-blinded , randomise 2 x 2 cross-over study conduct evaluate effect 40-day organic diet compare 40-day conventional diet biomarkers exposure ( pesticide metabolite ) biomarkers effect ( oxidative stress/inflammation marker ) child . The study approve Cyprus National Bioethics Committee ( ΕΕΒΚ/ΕΠ/2016/25 ) Cyprus Ministry Education Culture ( 7.15.06.15/2 ) . Written inform consent child participate study obtain child 's parent legal guardian . Study participant recruit public primary school Limassol , Cyprus follow communication school 's headmaster . Each school participate study randomized one two study arm ; conventional-organic organic-conventional . Participants ' blind possible since child know diet phase . However , document urine container cod , researcher blind subject ' identity group allocation . Participants provide 6 first morning urine sample duration study ; 1 baseline sample , 2 sample conventional phase 3 sample organic phase . Anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , waist circumference ) take begin end study train researcher school area . A baseline questionnaire administer parent begin study telephone interview collect information demographic characteristic , pesticide use household child 's activity . A food frequency questionnaire administer parent end conventional phase telephone interview collect information food habit child 40-day conventional period . A food diary give parent begin study parent use organic phase , collect information compliance child organic dietary menu , child 's health status pesticide use home . In order encourage adherence organic diet menu , event organise organic phase group , activity child free sample organic food product . Descriptive statistic use summarize demographic characteristic participate child . Categorical variable describe sample size percentage , normally-distributed continuous variable mean±SD non-normal continuous variable median interquartile range ( Q1-Q3 ) appropriate transformation conduct , log transformation . For test whether characteristic interest different among group Student 's t-test utilized continuous normally distributed variable chi-square test categorical characteristic . For continuous data normally distribute , Wilcoxon non-parametric analysis use instead transformation data conduct first order meet normality criterion . Linear mixed-effects model use account correlation among repeat urine sample collect child determine whether mean pesticide metabolite biomarkers concentration differ organic phase conventional phase .</detailed_description>
