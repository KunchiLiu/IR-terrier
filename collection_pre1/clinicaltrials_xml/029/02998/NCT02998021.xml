	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary purpose study explore benefit vibration dumbbell resistance train standard dumbbell resistance training improve upper limb strength , function pain among manual wheelchair user paraplegia . Experimental Design : Randomized Control Trial Methods : Twenty-four subject paraplegia recruit randomize two group , vibration dumbbell training ( V-DT ) group standard dumbbell train group ( S-DT ) . Both group participate supervise 12-week ( 3 session per week ) dumbbell ( free-weight ) strength train program consist nine exercise specifically design improve upper limb muscle function support propulsion transfer activity protect shoulder develop pain . For nine exercise vibration group hold high-frequency ( 40 Hz ) vibrate dumbbell static arm posture ( isometric training ) control group move non-vibrating dumbbell full range motion give exercise ( isotonic training ) . Both group follow standardize protocol assess progress amount weight add dumbbell achieve optimal training effect . All participant participate laboratory test various outcome measure baseline , 6 week , 12 week 18 week ( i.e . 6 week post intervention ) .</detailed_description>
