	<brief_title>Characterization Rebound Pain Following Peripheral Nerve Block Its Association With Gut Microbiome Diversity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based emerge understanding importance gut microbiome human animal response stress , clear gut microbiota influence bidirectional signal central nervous system ( CNS ) gut ( microbiota-gut-brain axis ) . One element influence role gut microbiota visceral hypersensitivity pain . Important clinical implication understand begin emerge : instance irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) patient cohort demonstrate distinct gut microbiome characteristic , pre-clinical model , manipulation gut microbiome lessen visceral hypersensitivity . To date , attempt improve pain symptom IBS use probiotic modestly variably successful . One research area offer potential discovery novel analgesic therapy activation endogenous opiate pain processing include augmentation descend inhibition . ( Broadly , identification new targets/alkaloid modification/ proteomics effort unsuccessful ) . Manipulation microbiota-gut-brain axis administer probiotic offer one potential route activation . There many example manipulation alter animal behavior physiology . In theory , opportunity manipulation might exist close early life stress noxious stimulus elective surgery . The relationship gut microbiome somatic neuropathic pain study . Certain pathways regulator visceral pain hypersensitivity also critical somatic pain handling . These include peripheral sensitization primary sensory afferent , central sensitization particular spinal ascending neuron alteration descend inhibitory pathway . These neuroplastic change well document surgical setting examination persistent post-surgical pain . `` Rebound pain '' quantifiable difference pain score block work , versus increase acute pain encounter first hour effect perineural single-injection continuous infusion local anesthetic resolve . Rebound pain may represent manifestation hypersensitivity offer accessible clinical model suitable examine association gut microbiome diversity perioperative neuroplastic change .</detailed_description>
