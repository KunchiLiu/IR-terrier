	<brief_summary>Objectives : The primary objective determine least frequent CPR training interval associate continued performance guideline-compliant CPR . The secondary objective determine whether certain physical characteristic , age , gender , exercise tolerance , height , weight may able identify HCPs high risk unable perform high-quality CPR . Design : Randomized trial compare effect different training frequency long-term CPR performance . Participants set : Nurses adult department Health Sciences North . Subjects randomly assign group undertakes short CPR assessment training session either 1 ) every month , 2 ) every 3 month , 3 ) every 6 month , 4 ) every 12 month ( control group ) course twelve-month period . Analysis : The proportion nurse group able perform `` excellent CPR '' twelve-month time point determine . Excellent CPR define two-minute CPR session 90 % compression perform correct depth ( 50-60 mm ) , 90 % correct rate ( 100-120 /min ) , 90 % full chest recoil . A subgroup analysis also perform demographic data individual unable perform excellent CPR twelve-month time point regardless intervention group compare successful . Conclusion : The result study help determine long CPR train interval associate maintenance high-quality CPR skills minimize training session require decrease associate cost . The result also generate hypothesis future study optimize role assignment team performance resuscitation .</brief_summary>
