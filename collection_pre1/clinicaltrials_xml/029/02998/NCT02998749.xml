	<detailed_description>Aims Agonal breathing ( `` gasp air '' ) previously find associate outcomes out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) patient resuscitation attempt . On hand , little know , agonal breathe regard whether positive factor survival hospital admission relate patient 's future quality life . For reason undertaken retrospective study use comprehensive emergency medical service ( EMS ) database Central Bohemian region Czech Republic . The primary endpoint study assess agonal breathing present EMS arrive positive impact six-month survival OHCA patient , independent factor like EMS response time BLS provision . The secondary endpoint seek determine agonal breathing positively impact ROSC evaluation various factor influence agonal breathing , specifically response time provision BLS . Method The data record use Utstein protocol . Only anonymized data use analysis . The data derive EMS registry Central Bohemian Region , large EMS Czech Republic . The study sample include OHCA case , presumed cardiac origin , resuscitate EMS 1st July 2013 30th June 2014 ( n = 584 ) . Two subsequent patient outcome : ( 1 ) return spontaneous circulation ( define spontaneous circulation hospital admission ) ( 2 ) six-month survival assess patient without agonal breathing . Six-month survival data OHCA patient presume cardiac origin derive administrative insurance registry medical record patient , aggregate data available . Factors may influence presence agonal breathing , specifically BLS provision professional EMS team reach patient second , EMS team response time , also examine . BLS provision lay person report first-on-scene EMS team ( yes/no ) phone assist CPR register dispatcher ( yes/no ) . BLS consider provide follow activity ( 1 ) resuscitation bystander , ( 2 ) phone assist CPR , ( 3 ) record perform . The response time calculate elapsed time record activation EMS team scene arrival time . Other covariates age sex also available analyze . The initial difference response time group assess use T-test . For categorical variable , chi-square test use . Simple multivariate logistic regression model use assess relationship factor related presence agonal breathing ROSC . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
