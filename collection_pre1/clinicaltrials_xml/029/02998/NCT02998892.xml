	<brief_summary>Population study suggest time spend sedentary behavior associate all-cause mortality include obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , independent time spend exercise . Frequent interruption sedentary time however beneficially associate metabolic health outcome , even individual exercise regularly . The goal use integrative approach understand biological mechanism underlie association longitudinal intervention study overweight sedentary adult . The investigator believe propose study provide initial evidence base health benefit break prolonged sit short burst activity . This innovative strategy may effective combat adverse effect sedentary behavior traditional approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Microbouts Activity Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare effect 4-weeks microbursts moderate-intensity activity calorically equivalent single bout 45 minute moderate-intensity exercise training , perform 5 day per week total 45 minute , free-living sedentary overweight adult : Aim 1 : plasma inflammatory cardiometabolic health biomarkers association total energy expenditure time spend sedentary behavior . H1 : Microbursts activity result high daily energy expenditure low time spend sedentary , respectively measure doubly labeled water accelerometry , traditional exercise training . This associate healthy inflammatory Interleukin 1 alpha ( IL1a ) , Interleukin 6 ( IL6 ) , Interleukin 10 ( IL10 ) , Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNFa ) cardiometabolic ( triglyceride , cholesterol , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) profile compare obtained traditional exercise training program . Aim 2 : 24-hr total fat carbohydrate oxidation , exogenous carbohydrate oxidation , dietary fat traffic oxidation incorporation muscle lipid fraction , mitochondrial function . H2 : Both one single continuous bout microbouts activity increase 24-hr total ( whole-room calorimetry ) dietary ( D9-palmitate ) fat oxidation due great mitochondrial lipid oxidation ( high resolution respirometry ) low incorporation dietary fatty acid muscle lipid fraction ( D9-palmitate ) , compare baseline sedentary control condition . Microbouts activity result great increase 24-hr total ( whole-room calorimetry ) exogenous ( U-13C6 glucose ) carbohydrate oxidation mitochondrial carbohydrate-linked oxidation , traditional isocaloric exercise training . Aim 3 : Whole-body insulin sensitivity . H3 : Both one single continuous bout microbouts activity improve whole-body insulin sensitivity Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test ( IVGTT ) compare baseline sedentary condition , improvement likely high microbouts activity . Exploratory aim : Self-perceived appetite , hunger , level mood , fatigue vigor/energy . H3 : Microbursts activity result less appetite , hunger fatigue great feeling vigor overall well-being traditional isocaloric exercise training . As result adherence microbursts well adherence single bout physical activity .</detailed_description>
