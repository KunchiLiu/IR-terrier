	<brief_title>Trial Perioperative Tadalafil Influenza Vaccination Cancer Patients Undergoing Major Surgical Resection Primary Abdominal Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical resection primary malignancy , critical cure , result postoperative immune suppression , characterize MDSC mediate inhibition NK cell kill . In preclinical model causal link immune suppression formation postoperative metastasis undeniable . Fortunately , postoperative immune suppression preventable use modulators MDSC NK cell function . In Phase Ib study hypothesis simultaneous administration perioperative tadalafil , prevent MDSCs suppress NK cell , influenza vaccine , directly activate NK cell safely effectively reverse effect surgical stress NK cell cytotoxicity . This necessary first step towards demonstrate re-purposed perioperative regimen reduce formation postoperative metastatic disease cancer surgery patient . In proposed Phase I trial carefully select promising perioperative immunomodulatory regimen , include tadalafil influenza vaccination , rapid clinical translation . The proposal re-purpose drug , already ample safety data associate use neither agent systematically administer immediately prior surgery . This trial allow u establish safety regimen permit rigorous assessment ability reverse surgery-induced suppression NK cell . If regimen effectively prevent postoperative NK cell dysfunction without regimen limit toxicity provide necessary data require undertake randomize efficacy study specific cancer subtype , cancer recurrence primary endpoint .</detailed_description>

Documented significant immunodeficiency due underlie illness ( e.g . HIV/AIDS ) and/or medication ( e.g . systemic corticosteroid , azathioprine , cyclosporin A ) . Subjects may physiologic dos replacement prednisone equivalent dos corticosteroid ( &lt; 7.5 mg daily ) . History autoimmune disease ( even control medication ) restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Allergies contraindication use tadalafil component Cialis® influenza vaccine ( include egg ) , Agriflu® . Serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , illness consider investigator unwarranted high risk investigational product . Patients suffer myocardial infarction , stroke , lifethreatening arrhythmia within last 6 month . Patients rest hypotension ( BP &lt; 90/50 rest ) hypertension ( BP &gt; 170/110 rest ) . Patients cardiac failure coronary artery disease cause unstable angina . Use type nitrate drug therapy , include shortacting nitratecontaining medication , due risk develop potentially lifethreatening hypotension . The use organic nitrate , either regularly and/or intermittently , form ( e.g . oral , sublingual , transdermal , inhalation ) absolutely contraindicate ( see list Appendix II ) .
