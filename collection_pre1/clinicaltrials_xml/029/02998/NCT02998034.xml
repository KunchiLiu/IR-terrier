	<brief_summary>In England year 9,000 people fracture hip . Most elderly female fracture occur fall . Approximately half fracture classify intracapsular fracture close proximity hip joint . The majority fracture treat surgically excise broken femoral neck remove femoral head ( ball part hip joint ) replace artificial hip joint . This hip replacement traditionally hemiarthroplasty sometimes term 'half hip replacement ' ball part hip joint replace . There number different design hemiarthroplasty may use . Some implant fix place bone cement whilst rest insert press fit without bone cement . The early design implant press fit design show inferior implant fix place bone cement . There however number new design implant coat substance ( hydroxyapatite ) encourage bone grow onto implant fix place . To date implant compare cement fit implant one previous study . This study find notable difference two type hemiarthroplasty . This study aim add research study compare standard cement fit implant hydroxyapatite coat press fit implant assist determine optimum surgical treatment common disable condition . Both implant use study still use extensively within United Kingdom worldwide treat fracture . The study therefore use two different implant within recommended area use , uncertainty best implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cemented Hemiarthroplasty Versus Uncemented Furlong Hemiarthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As follow-on current randomise trial different type treatment hip fracture , wish undertake prospective randomise trial compare modern cement hemiarthroplasty prosthesis modern hydroxyapatite coat uncemented arthroplasty . Cemented Exeter monoblock hemiarthroplasty The Exeter stem total hip replacement consider one foremost perform hip replacement world . The ETS ( Exeter trauma stem ) one implant cost around £200 . The implant modern instrumentation stem proven long term survival rate use total hip replacement . Hyroxyapatite coat prosthesis Coating hip prosthesis hydroxyapatite common practice uncemented hip replacement arthroplasty . The hydroxyapatite stimulates bone ingrowth around prosthesis think reduce loosen implant , residual pain long-term revision rate . The aim study assist define optimum choice arthroplasty acute hip fracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient admit Peterborough City Hospital displace intracapsular fracture consider inclusion study . • Younger patient internal fixation felt choice treatment preserve femoral head . This generally age less 60 year patient expect good long term survival treat reduction internal fixation . All patient injury treat reduction internal fixation specific indication . Those patient able walk independently door use stick cognitively impaired . These patient first consider ongoing randomise trial Hemiarthroplasty Total hip replacement ( R &amp; D reference R &amp; D/2012/30 , REC reference 12/LO/15490 ) Patients decline participate . Patients admit MJP available supervise treatment .</criteria>
