Impulsivity prominent predictor violence CD . Treatment program target impulsivity CD show effective increase pro-social functioning CD , biological mechanism underpin therapeutic gain well understood . Past research suggest cortisol ACC play role CD impulsivity . This study explore biological behavioral change response Stop , Now Plan Youth Justice Model ( SNAP YJ ) , validate 13-week psychosocial intervention address impulsivity self-control youth offenders The main hypothesis : 1 . CD youth respond SNAP YJ treatment exhibit great post-treatment ACC activation fMRI image task compare baseline , pre-treatment ACC activation . 2 . CD youth respond SNAP YJ treatment exhibit high post-treatment cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) compare baseline , pre-treatment CAR . The secondary hypothesis : 1 . CD youth exhibit lower ACC activation baseline fMRI image task compare baseline ACC activation exhibit typically develop youth . 2 . CD youth manifest low baseline CAR compare baseline CAR typically develop youth .</detailed_description>
