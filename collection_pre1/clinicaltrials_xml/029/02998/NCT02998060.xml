	<brief_title>Clinical Evidence Robot Guided vs. Navigated vs. Free Hand Lumbar Spinal Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A decade ago , minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) consider promising development spine surgery , yet value pioneering technology questionable . With grow number experience MIS surgeon , influx evidence favour MIS rapidly increase . This make compelling argument towards MIS offering distinct clinical benefit open approach term blood loss , length stay , rehabilitation , cost-effectiveness perioperative patient comfort . Due limit inexistent line-of-sight MIS procedure , surgeon need rely imaging , navigation , guidance technology operate safe efficient manner . Therefore , plethora new ever improve navigational system develop . These system allow consistent level safety accuracy , par result achieve experienced free hand surgeon , reasonably short learn curve . Computer-based navigation system first introduce spine surgery 1995 long establish standard certain cranial procedure , similarly adopt spine surgery . Designed overcome limitation navigation-based technology , robot-guided surgery become commercially available surgeon worldwide , like SpineAssist® ( Mazor Robotics Ltd. Caesarea , Israel ) recently launch ROSA™ Spine ( Zimmer-Biomet , Warsaw , Indiana , USA ) . These system rapidly challenge gold standard . SpineAssist® , upgraded version , Renaissance® , provide stable drill platform restrict surgeon 's natural full range motion 2 degree freedom ( up/down motion yaw cannula ) . The system 's guidance unit move trajectory base exact preoperative planning pedicle screw , accounting change intervertebral relationship due distraction , cage insertion change supine patient position preoperative CT prone patient operate table . Published evidence robot-guided screw placement demonstrate high level accuracy report range around 98 % screw place within pedicle cortical encroachment le 2 mm . Although reliability accuracy robot-guided spine surgery establish , actual benefit patient term clinical outcome revision surgery remain unknown . The investigator recently conduct cohort study show evidence robotic guidance lower rate intraoperative screw revision implant relate reoperations compare free hand procedure , achieve comparable clinical outcome . Now , factor , among others , assess high level evidence . This would , date , first randomize control trial compare clinical patient report outcomes robotic guide ( RG ) pedicle screw placement vs. navigate ( NV ) vs. free hand ( FH ) pedicle screw placement . The investigator 's aim conduct prospective randomize controlled trial . The randomized variable screw placement technique use . One arm treat lumbar fusion use robotic guidance ( RG ) , one arm receive procedure free hand technique ( FH ) third arm use navigation ( NV ) ( CT Fluoroscopy-assisted ) .</detailed_description>
