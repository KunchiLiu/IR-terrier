	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab Locally Advanced Esophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , multicenter phase II study pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy chemoradiation locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma examine safety efficacy combination pembrolizumab chemotherapy chemoradiation locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma assess 1 year disease free survival rate . The investigator primary aim examine safety efficacy pembrolizumab pre-operative treatment paradigm esophageal/GEJ carcinoma . The specific rationale investigator study design root three unanswered question : 1. addition immune check-point inhibitor ( pembrolizumab ) enhance efficacy cytotoxic therapy ( chemotherapy chemoradiation ) determine response rate , nodal down-staging 1 year disease free survival comparison historical control , 2. pathological effect combine pembrolizumab chemotherapy alone , 3. molecular ( PD-L1 expression ) , immunological ( TILs extent ) gene-expression signature associate efficacy pembrolizumab neoadjuvant setting .</detailed_description>
