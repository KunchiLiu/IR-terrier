	<brief_summary>HyPeR multi-centre Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study Guadecitabine ( SGI-110 ) Second Generation Hypo-Methylating Agent Combination Pembrolizumab ( MK3475 ) Patients Refractory Solid Tumours . The investigator investigate safety toxicity combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Study Guadecitabine Pembrolizumab .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I trial combination hypo-methylating agent guadecitabine anti-PD1 antibody ( anti- program cell death protein 1 ) pembrolizumab . Patients receive subcutaneous guadecitabine daily Days 1-4 21-day cycle . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously per 21-day cycle : Day 8 Cycle 2 Day 1 cycle Cycle 3 onwards . The rational design pre-loading Guadecitabine sensitise tumour Pembrolizumab re-expression gene enhance tumour recognition , increase density tumour infiltrate T-cells stimulation adaptive immune response . In Part A ( Dose Escalation ) investigator investigate escalate dos Guadecitabine combination Pembrolizumab . Patients advance solid tumour recruit cohort 3 6 patient investigate combination 200 mg pembrolizumab , administer intravenous injection , escalate dos guadecitabine , administer via subcutaneous injection , day 4 day ( Days 1-4 ) . Guadecitabine dose start 45mg/m2 decrease 30mg/m2 event toxicity increase 60mg/m2 absence toxicity . Once maximum tolerate dose reach ( advice Safety Review Committee ) patient enrol dose expansion phase ( Part B ) . Part B ( Dose Expansion ) : 20 patient recruited Part B explore safety activity combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab . This cohort include , limited patient : castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) possibly solid tumour base emerge anti-tumour activity data Part A relevant preclinical clinical publish data . Approximately 30 35 patient entered trial , 6 12 patient Part A 20 patient Part B . The anticipated accrual rate dose escalation phase involve approximately 3 patient per month across 2 centre . Accrual rate could higher low estimate take consideration first patient escalation cohort complete Cycle 2 Day 15 prior accrual patient cohort . Accrual expansion phase estimate 2-4 patient per month across 2 centre . It expect duration recruitment 12-24 month .</detailed_description>
