	<brief_title>NOACs Stroke Prevention Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Previous ICH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NASPAF-ICH study open-label , randomize , control , phase II study ass feasibility control trial examine efficacy safety non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) compare acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) stroke prevention patient high-risk atrial fibrillation previous intracerebral hemorrhage , well provide evidence efficacy safety plan phase III trial . Recruitment occur 10 high-volume stroke research centre across Canada 2 year , 100 adult patient high-risk atrial fibrillation ( CHADS2 ≥2 ) previous spontaneous traumatic ICH ( intraparenchymal intraventricular hemorrhage anticoagulation ) randomly assign receive NOAC ( particular agent discretion local investigator ) ASA 81 mg per day . Patients follow mean 1 year common end-study date . The feasibility recruitment also test . The investigator estimate five patient per year per centre recruit .</detailed_description>
