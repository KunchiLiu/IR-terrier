	<detailed_description>The two common stabilization procedure patient recurrent patellar instability reconstruction medial patellofemoral ligament ( MPFL ) medialization tibial tuberosity . MPFL reconstruction grow popularity , due large part technical demand tibial tuberosity realignment concern relate bone heal across osteotomy . In case severe trochlear dysplasia and/or dramatically lateralize tibial tuberosity , MPFL graft tensioned accord current standard may provide sufficient resistance limit lateral patellar tracking cause continue instability . Increasing graft tension could overload medial patellofemoral cartilage . The propose study base hypothesis ability MPFL reconstruction effectively limit lateral patellar maltracking decrease trochlear dysplasia lateral position tibial tuberosity increase . Computational dynamic simulation knee function perform establish anatomical standard tibial tuberosity medicalization likely MPFL reconstruction limit patellar maltracking without overload patellofemoral cartilage . The first specific aim computationally replicate lateral patellar maltracking pressure apply cartilage function patient treat patellar instability . Multibody dynamic knee model represent patient treated recurrent patellar instability base 3D reconstruction MRI scan . The modeling technique treat bone cartilage surface rigid body Hertzian contact determine contact force guide joint motion . Discrete element analysis technique use characterize contact pressure pattern base overlap cartilage surface . Models individually validate compare output vivo data . The source vivo data computational reconstruction vivo function base motion perform patient provide image data model development . The second specific aim computationally characterize influence surgical stabilization knee function individual patient . MPFL reconstruction tibial tuberosity medialization , variation surgical parameter , simulate . The actual surgical procedure perform patient simulate , influence lateral tracking compare vivo result validate representation surgical procedure . The third specific aim compare surgical option function patellofemoral anatomy . Variations patellar tracking pressure apply cartilage compare MPFL reconstruction tuberosity medialization . In addition , technique parametrically alter trochlear dysplasia tuberosity lateralization within model develop . Simulations perform vary anatomy set range surgical option limit patellar maltracking without elevate contact pressure . The modeling system available future study address additional surgical option anatomical parameter related patellar instability .</detailed_description>
