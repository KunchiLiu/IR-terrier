	<brief_summary>This clinical trial carry child diagnose high-risk neuroblastoma achieve complete good partial response standard therapy . An additional cohort child could achieve response criterion relapse standard therapy progressive disease receive Racotumomab together metronomic chemotherapy . The main objective study determine immune response one-year duration immunization Racotumomab , describe response Racotumomab therapy minimal residual disease ( MRD ) bone marrow describe toxicity profile Racotumomab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma common extra-cranial tumor childhood prognosis still poor , even advance treatment . New therapeutic strategy examine , several immunotherapeutic approach , include combine therapy monoclonal antibody ( anti-GD2 ) , intravenous interleukin-2 ( Il-2 ) intravenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , anti-idiotype vaccine currently assess . Racotumomab anti-idiotype antibody capable induce anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibody patient neuroblastoma . The expression ganglioside N-glycolyl GM3 show neuroblastoma expression could useful specific target immunotherapy . Ractoumomab administer standard therapy neuroblastoma complete .</detailed_description>
