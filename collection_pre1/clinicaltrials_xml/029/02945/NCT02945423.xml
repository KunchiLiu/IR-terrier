	<brief_title>Improving Understanding Catatonia Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : 1 . Identify phenotype participant range age 10-30 year old already diagnose catatonia . 2. Review laboratory investigation already complete conduct laboratory test previously complete , exclude general medical etiology catatonia . 3 . Obtain skin biopsy fibroblast participant reprogram somatic cell iPSC ( induced pluripotent cell line ) differentiate cortical neuron vitro pharmacological study target tissue . Up 30 patient consent . Eligibility determine UM medical record screening . When potential participant identify , study team reach treat clinician make contact participant research interest . Informed consent obtain prior initiation study-related procedure . Consent may email request potential participant representative advance schedule research appointment review . Additionally , informed consent take place person verbally write , adequate time participant ask question . Following informed consent , comprehensive psychiatric interview complete identify overall psychiatric diagnosis symptom catatonia . Based evaluation , decision make whether individual testable untestable neurocognitive assessment . A physical exam perform include weight , height , waist head circumference , well vital sign include blood pressure pulse rate . Electronic medical record ( EMR ) review identify comorbid medical condition , lab result medication receive include response agent . The medical disorder ( current past ) may include infective 26 27,28 , metabolic/ endocrine 29 , autoimmune 30 , toxic/ drug relate 31 seizure disorder . Neuropsychological testing ( NP ) : Standardized , well-validated test use assess emotional , behavioral neuropsychological functioning possible . Clinician complete rating autism symptom complete , well parental rating scale autism , general behavioral issue , quality life . In addition , participant undergo brief face-to face evaluation catatonic symptom preclude test cover domain intellectual functioning , academic achievement , receptive language , executive functioning , motor skill . These domain typically include neuropsychological testing protocol , brief , place minimal demand participant . Laboratory test : Laboratory work require purpose study include CBC , CMP , free T4 , TSH , thyroid antibody , ANA , ASO , CRP , urine toxicology , urine serum organic acid , Cu ceruloplasmin , anti-NMDAR receptor antibody , CMA ( chromosomal microarray ) , fragile X , EEG . If labs perform participant 's medical record , may use part study re-requested base upon physician judgment . DNA : one 8ml vial blood drawn store future DNA analysis . DNA store part Heinz C. Prechter Genetics Repository . Skin biopsy : skin biopsy obtain subset participant meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Assessment : Standardized interview questionnaire complete participant representative . Reliability : establish interviewer , level interview best estimate diagnosis . All available source clinical information , include medical record , informant data , ADOS ADI-R , independently review non-interviewing psychiatrist psychologist . Reviewers ' `` best-estimate '' diagnosis establish regular investigator meeting . If agreement , consensus diagnosis confirm . Quality Assurance : The PI co-investigators review interview check completeness accuracy . Interviewers give feedback subject re-contacted needed correct problem complete question . This reduce error miss data .</detailed_description>
