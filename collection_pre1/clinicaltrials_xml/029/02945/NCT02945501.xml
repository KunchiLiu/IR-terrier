	<brief_title>Transcranial Electrical Stimulation ( TES ) Slow Oscillation ( SO ) Frequency During NREM Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 subject enrol randomized participate study . A 60 minute TES stimulation sequence consist SO frequency stimulation ( TES SO ) use NeuroConn DC Stimulator PLUS sham stimulation administer second hour two hour nocturnal sleep period . During wake period subject test use various cognitive , subjective objective sleepiness mood measure . Vital sign measurement take monitor general health issue . Up 4 subject enrol per study session . Due logistical reason , 2 subject per session assign TES SO group . Screening visit = approx . 2 hour At-home component = 7 day In-laboratory study period = 138 hour Total in-laboratory period = approx . 138 hour per subject Total participation time ( home + in-laboratory component ) = 15 day</detailed_description>
