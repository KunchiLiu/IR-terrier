The hypothesis CRYOFOS lead fast reduction symptom functional limitation , fast return daily live activities.Thirty-six participant 18 year age old acute LAS ( sustain LAS three day less first evaluation session ) recruit randomly assign either group receive conventional rehabilitation program addition CRYOFOS ( experimental group ; n=18 ) , group receive conventional rehabilitation program ( comparison group ; n=18 ) . This single-blind ( evaluator ) , parallel-group RCT include five evaluation session 6 week ( baseline , day 7 , week 2 , week 4 week 6 ) 8 treatment session ( 1st 2nd week : 3 sessions/week ; 3rd 4th week : 1 session/week ) 4-week period .

	<brief_title>Neurocryostimulation Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral ankle sprain ( LAS ) one common reason primary care office emergency department visit , overall incidence 2.15 per 1,000 person-years United States.In acute phase , LAS associate swell , haematoma pain anterior talofibular calcaneofibular ligament , well ligamentous laxity ligament . Interventions follow acute LAS base upon three stage biological ligament healing : inflammatory phase , proliferation phase ( 6 week 3 month trauma ) remodelling maturation phase ( 1 year trauma ) . The initial treatment inflammatory phase direct towards avoid diminish excess swell ongoing injury , thus optimize heal process . Therefore , RICE ( Rest , Ice [ cryotherapy ] , Compression , Elevation ) treatment choice first 7 10 day reduce pain swell . Cryotherapy use long time rehabilitation ; mainly use ice , cool pack cold water . Lately , new device , CRYOFOS , develop provide perform way use cryotherapy . CRYOFOS use fluid ( hyperbaric CO² ) spray form dry ice body region treat . It lead so-called thermal shock , see skin temperature cool 32 ˚C 2-4 ˚C 30 sec.While CRYOFOS seem , theoretically , good cooling procedure , superiority never determine follow acute injury LAS . Considering extensive use cold management acute LAS , would even relevant examine impact cryotherapy reduction symptom functional limitation subject sustain LAS . The objective exploratory randomize control trial compare , participant acute lateral ankle sprain ( LAS ) , reduction symptom functional limitation two group subject undergo conventional rehabilitation program ( experimental group ) without CRYOFOS ( comparison group ) . The hypothesis CRYOFOS lead fast reduction symptom functional limitation , fast return daily live activities.Thirty-six participant 18 year age old acute LAS ( sustain LAS three day less first evaluation session ) recruit randomly assign either group receive conventional rehabilitation program addition CRYOFOS ( experimental group ; n=18 ) , group receive conventional rehabilitation program ( comparison group ; n=18 ) . This single-blind ( evaluator ) , parallel-group RCT include five evaluation session 6 week ( baseline , day 7 , week 2 , week 4 week 6 ) 8 treatment session ( 1st 2nd week : 3 sessions/week ; 3rd 4th week : 1 session/week ) 4-week period . The primary outcome functional limitation , evaluate use Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS ) . Secondary outcome include level ankle pain , evaluate use Numeric Pain Rating Scales ( NPRS ) , weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion range motion ( also call Bent Knee DorsiFlexion test ) , assess maximal advancement tibia talus weight-bearing position , joint swelling , use Figure-of-Eight method . Both group receive conventional program consisting : compression , bracing , early mobilization ( include manual therapy ) , strengthen ( isometric isotonic use elastic band ) proprioception ( use proprioception board ) exercise , accord grade sprain stage biological ligament healing . However , experimental group , CRYOFOS apply ankle end 8 session ( accordance protocol establish ) . Descriptive statistic use outcome measure measurement time summarise result . Baseline demographic data compare ( independent t-test Chi-squared test ) establish comparability group . All data test check distributional assumption inferential statistical analysis . An intention-to-treat analysis use participant analyse group originally assign . All dropout reason drop study report . Any harm unintended effect program record . A 2-way ANOVA ( 2 cryotherapy [ CRYOFOS Ice ] x 5 Time [ baseline , day 7 , week 2 , week 4 , week 6 ] ) use analyse effect CRYOFOS primary outcome ( LEFS ) secondary outcome ( SPSS 22 , proc GENLIN [ Generalized Estimating Equations repeat measure ] ) .</detailed_description>
