	<brief_title>Effects Mobilization Conjunction With Therapeutic Exercise Participants With History Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Joint mobilization report increase range motion ( ROM ) , postural control proprioception , decrease pain individual CAI . There research support combined effect thrust mobilization exercise function population . Inclusion exclusion criterion establish convenience sample perform . 19 subject randomize exercise mobilization ( experimental ) exercise group . Both group undergo 12 supervised training session across six-week period . The mobilization ( experimental ) group also receive high-velocity-low-amplitude ( HVLA ) thrust mobilization talocrural , proximal , distal tibiofibular joint prior first three treatment session . An examiner blind involved limb group allocation perform baseline six-week follow-up examination muscle strength , joint mobility , range motion , and/or functional performance . The participant complete subjective outcome measure baseline , 2 week , 4 week , finally 6 week include Functional Ankle Disability Index ( FADI ) , FADI-Sport , Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool ( AJFAT ) . Participants also complete baseline six-week follow assessment figure-of-8 hop test , side hop test , three direction Star Excursion Balance test ( SEBT ) . The exercise protocol modify version balance train program describe McKeon et al . Participants complete protocol twice week , six week . Treatment session last approximately 30 minute . Participants individually progress particular exercise zero error observe . In addition , participant give home exercise program ( HEP ) complete every day week exclude treatment day . The mobilization ( experimental ) group receive HVLA thrust mobilization three joint state first three session prior complete exercise protocol . Each mobilization perform one time joint . The order joint mobilization randomize prior administer . Data analysis perform use International Business Machines Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version ( 22 ) . Alpha level set p &lt; 0.05 . Separate 2 x 2 repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use assess change FADI , FADI-Sport , figure-of-8 hop test , side hop test , three direction SEBT .</detailed_description>
