	<brief_title>Effect Caloric Restriction Protein Intake Metabolism Anabolic Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Preliminary test Prior study start , participant weigh body composition determine use calipermetry ( 7 site ) bioelectrical impedance . Peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) assess use incremental exercise test bicycle ergometer . 2 . Randomization Participants proceed follow condition last 5 day : CR-LP : Participants restrict 30 kcal/kg FFM/day protein intake low ( 0.8 g/kg BW/day ) . CR-HP : Participants restrict 30 kcal/kg FFM/day protein intake high ( 1.7 g/kg BW/day ) . CON : Participants energy balance consume 1.7 g protein/kg BW/day . 3 . Diet Prescription Dietary energy intake control use clinical product maltodextrin meet target energy intake . Participants receive calcium Vitamin D supplementation throughout study . 4 . Exercise Prescription During condition , participant conduct daily supervise exercise bicycle ergometer exercise intensity 60 % VO2peak . Exercise duration adjust individually exercise energy expenditure amount 15 kcal/kg FFM/day . Additional exercise intense physical activity prohibit . 5 . Assessments The following assessment conduct prior start condition well upon completion condition : body weight composition ( impedance ) , fast blood draw assessment metabolic anabolic hormone , rest metabolic rate , aerobic fitness ( VO2peak ) , questionnaires . 6 . Washout Once participant complete study condition , participant allow washout least 14 day allow protein balance return baseline ( Hoffer &amp; Forse , 1990 ) . During time , participant resume regular diet physical activity .</detailed_description>
