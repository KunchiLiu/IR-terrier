	<brief_title>Broader Implementation Successful Dual-Generation Intervention Partnership With Head Start Lane County</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based basic research neuroplasticity attention , stress , family dynamic , investigator develop successful dual-generation intervention target attention , stress , self-regulation . The intervention show improve brain function attention , cognition , behavior preschool child Head Start ( HS ) also improve communication skill reduce stress parent . This project involve development scaled-up model intervention work Head Start Lane County ( HSOLC ) . Goal 1 : In partnership HSOLC , investigator develop scaled-up model intervention deliver HS specialist sustainable replicable HS program . This intervention call Creating Connections : Strong Families , Strong Brains ( CC ) . Goal 2 : To characterize degree CC improve distal outcomes related parent/family well-being assess health safety outcomes parent child , parental education , financial literacy decision making , household chaos , biomarkers allostatic load related health outcome . Goal 3 : To evaluate hypothesized mediate factor relate change family well-being , specifically change foundational system ( stress self-regulation ) refining measure family stress self-regulation assess heart rate variability parent child neurophysiological measure self-regulation parent . Children parent randomly assign HSOLC site receive CC , HSOLC sit deliver regular HS curriculum . The investigator hypothesize participation CC result improve brain function attention self-regulation well improved physiological function stress regulation child parent compare family receive intervention .</detailed_description>
