For intervention visit two , standard care sero-status specific . For HIV-negatives standard care remain CTR . For HIV-positives standard care case management , offer routinely ASO , involve counsel linkage care importance care retention . To examine sequence dose intervention impact efficacy , investigator propose randomize baseline factorial randomize controlled trial . The control arm receive SOC-only intervention visit one two ( SOC-only ) . Experimental arm one ( SOC+SUBI ) receive SOC visit one SUBI visit two . Experimental arm two ( SUBI+SOC ) receive SUBI visit one SOC visit two . Experimental arm three ( SUBI+SUBI ) receive intervention condition visit one two . The RCT thus answer two important question : 1 ) What impact addition SUBI SOC HIV engagement care sexual substance-related risk-taking behavior among high-risk YMSM ? 2 ) What combination service ( SOC-only , SOC+SUBI , SUBI+SOC , SUBI+SUBI ) great impact engagement HIV prevention ?
