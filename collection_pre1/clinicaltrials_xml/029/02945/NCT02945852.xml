	<brief_summary>Although fist-line therapy Cisplatin etoposide ( EP ) Carboplatin etoposide ( CE ) second-line therapy topotecan give , patient extensive small cell lung cancer ( ED-SCLC ) still relapse 2-year survival le 10 % . There standard treatment recommendation group patient fail second-line therapy good performance status . Apatinib approve second-line treatment advance gastric cancer . Several phase III clinical study non small cell lung cancer , liver cancer , colorectal cancer tumor also show apatinib less toxic side effect well patient tolerance . However , clinical application apatinib small cell lung cancer still lack evidence-based medicine . And clinical trial design prospectively investigate efficacy safety apatinib refractory recurrent ED-SCLC patient center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apatinib Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer After Second/Third Line Chemotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) highly aggressive disease characterize rapid doubling time , high growth fraction , early development disseminate disease , dramatic response first-line chemotherapy radiation . Small cell lung cancer account approximately 20 % -25 % lung cancer patient . SCLC patient categorize limited disease , define disease confine ipsilateral hemithorax encompass within tolerable radiation port , extensive disease ( ED ) , define presence overt metastatic disease determine image physical examination . Two third patient diagnose ED presentation . Despite development novel cytotoxic drug , therapeutic approach SCLC stagnant twenty year . Standard treatment ED-SCLC remain EP CE , regimen yield median survival approximately 9 month 5-year survival le 1 % .In guideline SCLC , topotecan recommended standard second-line treatment patient relapse less 3 month . As patient relapse six month end initial treatment , EP CE regimen recommend use again.There standard treatment recommendation group patient fail second-line therapy.Apatinib approve second-line treatment advance gastric cancer . Several phase III clinical study non small cell lung cancer , liver cancer , colorectal cancer tumor also show apatinib less toxic side effect well patient tolerance.And clinical trial design prospectively investigate efficacy safety apatinib refractory recurrent ED-SCLC patient .</detailed_description>
