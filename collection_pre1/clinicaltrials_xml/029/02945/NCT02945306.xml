	<brief_summary>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) condition affect 10 % child age 2-6 year . It combination snore night sleep , patchy sleep , short period stop breathing ( apnoea ) usually big tonsil . Most child get well treatment 8 year old . It suggest SDB mean child concentrate behave less well day may learn slowly child n't snore . It become common many Ear , Nose Throat ( ENT ) surgeon take tonsil adenoid ( adenotonsillectomy ) condition . Removing tonsils adenoid ( normally big age ) mean child quickly stop snore seem cure . Unfortunately clear operation make difference learn compare watch child let `` grow '' condition ( watchful wait ) . There set treatment UK today . Children may offer adenotonsillectomy watchful waiting ; know , long term , right thing . Therefore investigator wish study look two different treatment see difference child 's learning time two different treatment . The investigator look child SDB , measure learning ( behaviour ) randomly select child get one treatment . They re-measure learn ( behaviour ) 7 month later see difference two group . The investigator also scientifically measure sleep . This possibly quite difficult study , investigator unsure whether family agree take part easy measure learn young child ( age 2:6 - 5 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Disordered Breathing , Adenotonsillectomy , Cognition Pre-school Age Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Design . Large number child snore regular basis UK . It known habitual snoring associate cognitive weakness know cause cognitive weakness . Teenagers snore young age less well school peer , snore young age , know due snore multiple confound factor . More 60 % child snore regularly 3 year age stop regularly snore 7 year age . They grow SDB active treatment . If tonsils adenoid remove 80 % immediately stop snoring ( cure ) . Research show tonsil adenoid remove 6-8 year old , difference cognitive ability group adenotonsillectomy . It known several year habitual snoring , sleep fragmentation recurrent short-lived episode hypoxia cause minor change develop brain cause cognitive weakness . Therefore known take tonsils adenoid young age ( 2-4 year ) first start snoring , thus avoid several year habitual snoring , sleep fragmentation recurrent mild hypoxia , make difference cognition future . It known period number year habitual snoring ( possible sleep fragmentation recurrent episode hypoxia ) cause irreversible cognitive weakness , reversible cognitive weakness cognitive weakness . 35,000 child undergo adenotonsillectomy England Wales per year second common indication SDB ( habitual snoring feature recurrent upper airway obstruction ) . The balance benefit versus detrimental effect adenotonsillectomy child SDB accurately know . The detrimental effect well know . They include significant pain least 7 day child , bleed operation 1 % , , rarely death . The benefit le clear . Adenotonsillectomy pre-school age child SDB result improve behaviour quality life score short term know effect cognition . The effect adenotonsillectomy cognitive development versus effect watchful wait supportive care ( treatment associate condition chronic otitis medium effusion rhinitis ) need investigation , clinician give family true description advantage disadvantage surgery SDB . The investigator therefore need ask question - Does adenotonsillectomy preschool age child alter future cognitive development ? Answering question require large , multicentre randomise control study . This study aim assess feasibility carry large randomise control trial . It try answer following question : 1 . Can investigators effectively measure cognition preschool age child ? 2 . Will parent prepared take part study ? 3 . Can investigator obtain useful sleep study young child home ? 4 . Will child stay study long enough allow follow ? 5 . Can investigator define value allow u power large randomise control trial ? 6 . Does SRBD scale work pragmatic screen tool SDB UK population ? Although number study small , investigator may find large difference outcome two group make large randomise control trial unnecessary . Data study therefore analyse . Recruitment : All child 2.6 year 5 year , refer two ENT surgeon Middlesbrough General Practitioners Teesside geographical area possible SDB consider recruitment trial . They offer entry trial meet inclusion exclusion criterion . The aim criterion study population child typical clinical feature SDB would actively consider informed ENT surgeon possibly offer adenotonsillectomy treatment typical UK practice . Clear inclusion exclusion criterion place delineate population . Randomisation : Participants randomise one two treatment , either early removal tonsil adenoid general anaesthesia watchful waiting , allow child potentially grow condition without surgical intervention . Consent : Clear unambiguous information provide parents/guardians prospective participant time receive outpatient appointment letter . This information provide form patient information sheet.Treatment decision SBD make time ENT outpatient clinic . Therefore receive information outpatient appointment allow parent/guardian adequate time consider study fully 're ask whether wish participate . The participant recruit child young provide consent assent ; therefore important parent participant well informed time consider information fully . Parents/guardians offer opportunity ask question may time outpatient clinic also make aware participation voluntary withdrawn time . The consent form complete research psychologist ensure parent/guardian fully aware trial involve therefore make informed choice . The research psychologist training mental capacity assessment competent assess ensure comprehension reason decision making . If eligible participant offer entry study parent provide inform consent time clinic attendance . This avoid delay assessment treatment process line treatment format clinic . Risks , burden benefit : The investigator know best course treatment young child SDB . There single study preschool age child SDB low follow rate ( Biggs . PLoS One 2015 ) . This study find difference cognitive development behaviour 3 year post diagnosis irrespective whether child undergone adenotonsillectomy . These child cognitive weakness compare non-snoring control , get bad whether received surgical treatment observe . Current practice offer adenotonsillectomy may subject child painful operation offer long term benefit . Set , adenotonsillectomy know immediately improve quality life old child know difference see 7 month post randomisation still present 2-3 year later child grow SDB . This study therefore equipoise .</detailed_description>
