	<brief_title>Sodium Lowering Urinary Protein Reduction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proteinuria early sensitive marker kidney damage risk factor chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progression , cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . Several cross-sectional epidemiological study report association sodium intake albuminuria ( majority proteinuria ) independent blood pressure ( BP ) . In addition , handful small clinical trial suggest reduction dietary sodium intake may decrease albuminuria patient CKD . The overall goal randomize control trial study effect dietary sodium reduction albuminuria CKD patient albuminuria . A total 150 participant CKD albuminuria recruit randomly assign either 24-week intensive behavioral modification program design reduce dietary sodium intake 2,300 mg/day usual care 1:1 randomization ratio . The primary outcome difference active intervention control group change urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio baseline 24 week follow-up . Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio assess average two 24-hour urine collection time point . Secondary outcome include estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , BP , number antihypertensive medication . Urinary sodium excretion use measure success intervention . Racial difference albuminuria change due reduction dietary sodium intake analyze . The intervention program model best practice derive investigator prior experience conduct sodium reduction behavioral intervention . The intervention program address individual barrier long-term sodium reduction generate collective enthusiasm motivation adherence program . Study staff receive training direct support consultant extensive experience successful implementation behavioral dietary modification intervention . Results study clarify role dietary sodium reduction management CKD patient albuminuria potential halt progression CKD , global public health concern . The study also explore interaction race/ethnicity dietary sodium reduction albuminuria CKD patient .</detailed_description>
