	<brief_summary>The study aim develop validate integrate clinico-molecular model accurate survival prognostication newly diagnose SMZL . Already exist cod tumor biological material health-related personal data retrospectively collect . Mutation analysis perform targeted deep next generation sequence tumor genomic DNA . Deletion 7q assess FISH nuclei isolate tumor tissue . Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement mutation status analyze tumor genomic DNA PCR Sanger sequence . The methylation status target gene assess methylation specific PCR tumor genomic DNA . The adjusted association exposure variable OS estimate Cox regression . This approach provide covariates independently associate OS utilized development hierarchical molecular model predict OS . The hierarchical order relevance predict OS among covariates establish recursive partitioning analysis . An amalgamation algorithm use merge terminal node show homogenous OS . The discrimination capacity model assess calculate c-index . Relative survival analysis use provide measure excess mortality experience patient 's subgroup stratify accord developed hierarchical molecular model , irrespective whether excess mortality directly indirectly attributable disease . The model develop training set test validation set model performance ( c-index ) validation set compare training set .</brief_summary>
