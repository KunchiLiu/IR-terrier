	<detailed_description>Length Study : You receive radiation therapy long doctor think best interest . Your participation study follow-up period ( 5 year complete radiation therapy ) . Study Visits : At point complete chemotherapy begin radiation therapy , image-guided biopsy breast test evidence disease . To perform image-guided biopsy , needle insert affected area use image CT , ultrasound , MRI mammography collect cell tissue organ , lymph node , suspect tumor mass . The doctor use image guide needle area . The sample collect core biopsy collect small piece tissue . If biopsy show evidence disease , schedule standard care surgery still receive radiation therapy remain study . You would sign separate consent form surgery . Within 12 week complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy breast . The doctor discus dose amount length radiation therapy period . During radiation therapy , weekly visit doctor . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) first radiation therapy visit , 6 month 1 year complete radiation therapy . CTC test check many tumor cell blood . You ask complete 3 questionnaire quality life symptom first agree take part study , 6 month , 1 , 3 , 5 year post-chemotherapy biopsy . The questionnaire complete mail , email , phone call . The questionnaire take 15 minute complete time . Follow-Up : Every 6 month 5 year finish radiation therapy , physical exam mammogram . If doctor think need , MRI instead mammogram every 6-month visit . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . The study doctor explain radiation therapy design work . About 50 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pathologically confirm unicentric invasive breast cancer define radiologic clinical stage T1 T2 ( &lt; /= 5 cm ) , N0 N1 ( &lt; /= 4 abnormal axillary node initial ultrasound ) , clinical stage M0 . 2 . HER2 positive ( IHC 3+ FISH amplify ) triple receptor negative ( TN , ER/PR &lt; 10 % HER2 negative ( IHC 1+ 2+ FISH nonamplified ) receive standard routine clinical NST regimen . 3 . Patient desire breast conserve therapy . 4 . Age 40 year old . This age cutoff justify breast cancer woman age 40 know significantly high risk IBTR presumably due underlie biologic difference . 5 . Female sex . 6 . If patient history prior nonbreast cancer , treatment cancer must complete prior study registration patient must evidence disease prior nonbreast cancer . 7 . Patient must initial nodal ultrasound demonstrate four suspicious lymph node , suspicious lymph node biopsied determine nodal metastatic disease present . 1 . Clinical evidence stage T3 T4 breast cancer . 2 . Clinical pathologic evidence distant metastasis . 3 . Prior diagnosis invasive ductal carcinoma situ breast cancer ipsilateral breast . 4 . Clinical evidence progression disease &gt; 20 % breast new evidence nodal metastasis . 5 . Patient know pregnant . 6 . Patient participate NST protocol surgical excision breast lymph node require .</criteria>
