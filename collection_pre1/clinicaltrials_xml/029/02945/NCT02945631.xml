	<brief_title>Quarterback 2 - Sequential Therapy With Reduced Dose Chemoradiotherapy HPV Oropharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In general , patient HPVOPC young live prolong period . They high risk long-term toxicity mortality radiotherapy . While long-term consequence chemotherapy head neck cancer relatively constrain , high-dose radiotherapy ( RT ) chemoradiotherapy substantially impact local tissue organ function result significant rate late mortality morbidity patient . Studies design reduce impact RT CRT patient . Identifying appropriate endpoint study arm allow early assessment outcomes problematic , particularly equivalence study wherein survival difference small , prolonged time period large patient number necessary accurately assess outcome . For Sequential Therapy give TAX 324 , 3-year PFS may appropriate endpoint . The may possible CRT . The best example change outcome CRT trial would R91-11 , premature negative conclusion regard efficacy induction therapy publish early analysis . Late toxicity morbidity , hallmark upfront cisplatin-based CRT trial , lead equivalence induction therapy CRT laryngectomy-free survival 5 year , importantly non-significant relative 10 % improvement overall survival PF induction arm compare CRT arm include every 3-week bolus cisplatin 3 cycle radiotherapy . The survival result HPVOPC achieve TAX 324 preliminary data ECOG 1308 strongly suggest might possible reduce long-term morbidity HPVOPC preserve survival perhaps well patient selection reduce radiotherapy intensity context ST advance case . Best approach HPV-negative disease might novel therapy aggressive ST CRT . Current radiation dose reduction trial way ECOG , RTOG radiation base group . The data TAX 324 suggest possible reduce radiation dose superior progression free survival ability select risk base CRT .</detailed_description>
