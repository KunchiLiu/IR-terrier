	<brief_title>SElf-SAMpling Cervical Cancer Screening ; SESAM Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concept collect cervical cancer screen smear home self-sampling new target population medical professional . Self-sampling increase screen attendance could alternative recruit woman cervical cancer screen Norway . As implementation ongoing switch cytology base screen HPV base screen Norway , reliable self-sampling method HPV test available . Furthermore , detection HPV self-sampled specimen require laboratory capacity expertise comply quality assurance demand internal quality control , external quality assessment quality improvement . National study crucial obtain knowledge build expertize among health care provider . This study aim show non-inferior sensitivity hrHPV test self-sampled vs. clinician-sampled specimen detect high-grade cervical lesion cancer ( CIN2+ ) . Additionally ; - Evaluate overall hrHPV type specific concordance self-taken physician-taken sample . - Evaluate participant view feasibility acceptability self-sampling ( questionnaire ) - Compare participant screen history questionnaire evaluate reason participate national screening program ( case ) . - Biobank biological material collect self-sample , physician take sample , blood urine , future analysis HPV-related disease cancer . Study participant recruit colposcopy referral cancer care unit three different hospital . Patients CIN 2 CIN 3 lesion ( n=200 ) recruit Oslo University Hospital , Ullevål Østfold Hospital Trust , cancer patient ( n=50 ) recruit Radiumhospital .</detailed_description>
