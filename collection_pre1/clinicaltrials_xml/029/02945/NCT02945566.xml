	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer third common tumour UK , Netherlands Denmark 41000 , 14000 4000 new case per year respectively . Standard primary radical Total Mesorectal Excision ( TME ) surgery oncologically effective treatment early stage rectal cancer . However , resection low rectal tumour require permanent stoma approximately 5-10 % case many patient temporary stoma , reverse . Radical surgery , evolve treat locally advance , symptomatic tumour , may optimal method treatment early screen-detected tumour organ preserve strategy may generate significantly less morbidity without substantially compromise oncological outcome . TREC randomise phase II trial test feasibility randomisation TME organ preserve policy short course pre-operative radiotherapy ( SCPRT ) delay follow transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) . STAR-TREC phase II feasibility study evaluate whether possible accelerate patient recruitment attain TREC study , 4 per month first year recruitment 6 per month second .

	<brief_title>Can Rectum Saved Watchful Waiting TransAnal Surgery Following ( Chemo ) Radiotherapy Versus Total Mesorectal Excision Early REctal Cancer ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STAR-TREC randomise , three arm ( 1:1:1 ) study use follow arm : 1 . Standard TME surgery ( control ) 2 . Organ save use : 1. long course concurrent chemoradiation 2. short course radiotherapy For organ-preserving strategy clinical response radiotherapy determine next treatment step . Radiotherapy response evaluate use endoscopy tumour regression grade , assess MRI . The first assessment 11-13 week ( radiotherapy start ) use MRI endoscopy identify minority non-responders convert TME surgery . Patients demonstrate satisfactory radiotherapy response 11-13 week reassess endoscopy 16-20 week . Re-evaluation determines STAR-TREC criterion complete clinical response ( cCR ) meet . Patients achieve cCR may progress directly active surveillance . Those fulfil criterion cCR progress excision biopsy transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) . Patients organ save arm assign either ; A . Long course concurrent chemoradiation : Capecitabine : 825 mg/m² orally , b.i.d. , radiotherapy day Radiotherapy : A dose 50 Gy , apply primary tumour surround mesorectum , 25 fraction 2 Gy , 5 day week . B . Short course preoperative radiotherapy A dose 25Gy , apply , primary tumour surround mesorectum 5 fraction 5 Gy , 5 day week . As feasibility study , trial recruitment rate 's primary outcome .</detailed_description>
