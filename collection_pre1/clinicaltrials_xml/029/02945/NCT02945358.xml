	<brief_summary>A prolonged stay intensive care unit ( ICU ) cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass increase cost patient care also morbidity mortality patient . The ability predict patient tendency prolong ICU stay would help patient resource management hospital . There many predictive model aim identify patient risk prolong ICU stay cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass almost involve preoperative assessment proper resource management one model , Open-Heart Intraoperative Risk ( OHIR ) Scoring concern intraoperative manipulatable risk factor improve anesthetic care patient outcome . The OHIR model comprise 6 risk factor , 5 manage intraoperatively , total score 7 score â‰¥ 3 indicate likely prolong ICU stay . The objective study re-validate performance OHIR score recent context .</brief_summary>
