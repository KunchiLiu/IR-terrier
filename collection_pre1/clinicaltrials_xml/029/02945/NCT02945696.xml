	<brief_title>Abdominal Wall Nerve Blockade : A Comparison With Local Port Site Injection Well Between Use Ultrasound Laparoscopy Guide Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain control abdominal surgery child often complex , multifaceted problem require multimodal approach treatment . Infiltration wound long-acting local anesthetic , either surgical field locoregional nerve blockade , know decrease narcotic requirement . Nerve block abdominal wall occur several modality , among transverse abdominis plane block rectus sheath block . The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block place local anesthetic plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle , directly block innervation spinal nerve T9-L3 , ilioinguinal , iliohypogastric lateral cutaneous branch L1-3 , reduce pain sensation anterior abdominal wall . The rectus sheath block place local anesthetic internal oblique transversus abdominis level terminal branch intercostal nerve 9-11 . The investigator perform prospective randomize study compare effectiveness laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve block local wound site infiltration ultrasounded guide abdominal wall block . The goal study determine whether patient receive nerve block significantly less pain compare patient receive local infiltration anesthetic . Secondly , investigator believe laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve block effective abdominal wall block perform ultrasound-guidance , may fact allow consistent infiltration local anesthetic desire nerve bundle . Thirdly , investigator believe laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve block significantly less time intensive ultrasound-guided abdominal wall nerve block , allow cost saving decrease time general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
