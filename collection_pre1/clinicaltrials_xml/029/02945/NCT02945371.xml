	<brief_summary>Insufficient inhibitory control one pathway early adversity relate range problem include excessive alcohol use , tobacco use , unhealthy eating . The propose research leverage neurally inform model inhibitory control improve test efficacy person-centered inhibitory control intervention sample mid-life individual early adversity . The knowledge obtain study could scale flexible , low-cost , wide-ranging intervention remediate effect early adversity inhibitory control thus number prevalent health risk behavior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailored Inhibitory Control Training Reverse EA-linked Deficits Mid-life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early adversity ( EA ) humans major contribute factor range deleterious physical mental health outcome extend adulthood depression anxiety , obesity heart disease , premature death . In addition detract significantly individual well quality life , condition also consume considerable resource federal , state , community organization . The mechanisms EA exert effect outcomes increasingly well understood , include neurocognitive pathway relate executive function . An intervention successfully target , engage , alter function one mechanism would promise way mitigate impact EA deleterious outcome later life . The propose research focus one pathway—deficits inhibitory control ( IC ) —and test feasibility efficacy intervention increase function pathway sample individual experience EA . The intervention ground neurally inform model change specify deficit IC underlie causal factor common several health-risking behavior ( HRBs ) . These IC deficit emerge development result range EA , , critically , remediate mid-life target intervention . Research laboratory validate intervention increase IC performance alter underlie neural system young adult ( Berkman , Kahn , &amp; Merchant , 2014 ) . The next step program research , propose , test efficacy intervention sample mid-life individual experience EA extent intervention generalize HRBs prevalent sample . The first Aim test whether intervention alters IC system task similar dissimilar training task term behavioral performance neural functioning . The second Aim test whether alteration function underlying neural system mediate effect intervention performance disinhibition-related HRBs . The two Aims accomplish within context single randomize control trial ( RCT ) two arm ( IC train vs. active control ) pre-post measurement IC performance , IC neural system , HRBs . All participant ( N = 110 ) come lab initial assessment behavioral / neural measure IC HRBs , among measure . Then , participant randomly assign receive Person-Centered Inhibitory Control ( PeCIC ) train active control training , every day 3-4 week . The PeCIC systematically pair IC engagement alcohol , tobacco , and/or energy-dense food cue , depend participant 's report disinhibited behavior domain . The active control task use personalize cue response time task involve IC . Finally , participant return laboratory endpoint assessment baseline measure repeat . The two Aims robustly test series analysis compare behavioral neural change pre- postintervention group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 3555 Experience early adversity ( EA ) age 18 ( EA define score 4 high Adverse Childhood Experiences ( ACEs ) questionnaire [ Felitti , Anda , Nordenberg , Williamson , Spitz , Edwards , et al. , 1998 ] ) IC difficulty disinhibited alcohol use , tobacco use , food intake adulthood . IC difficulty selfreported base question selfcontrol questionnaire ( Tangney , Baumeister , &amp; Boone , 2004 ) modify specific alcohol , tobacco , energydense food intake ( e.g. , `` I selfindulgent unhealthy food time '' , `` I refuse alcohol offer '' ) use 4point Likertstyle scale . Individuals age 55 exclude establish functional structural neural change begin escalate time ( Good , Johnsrude , Ashburner , Henson , Friston , &amp; Frackowiak , 2001 ; Grady , Springer , Hongwanishkul , McIntosh , &amp; Winocur , 2006 ) Given high rate morbidity disorder among people high EA , exclude base past diagnosis disorder base current drug alcohol use . However , exclude individual pass urine toxicology screen either functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) session ensure neuroimaging data homogeneous reliable possible . Participants undergo MRI scan exclude ; contraindication include metal implant ( e.g. , brace , pin ) metal fragment , pacemaker electronic medical implant , claustrophobia , pregnancy , weight great 550 lb . Beyond criterion , participant recruit without exclusion base gender , race , ethnicity , sample reflect diversity local population ( Lane County , Oregon ) regard gender , race , ethnicity .</criteria>
