	<brief_summary>This study ass safety effectiveness drug call apixaban treatment upper extremity deep vein thrombosis ( UEDVT ) clinically important bleeding . Subjects receive apixaban 10 mg mouth twice day 7 day , follow 5 mg mouth twice day duration 11 week . There followup visit 12 week participant . A total 375 enrol . The study drug approve treat blood clot . The study drug study uniquely treatment blood clot upper extremity however . Because unknown whether effective treat blood clot upper extremity , principal investigator guarantee benefit study subject ; however , hop information obtain research study help treat patient future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apixaban Routine Management Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis ( UEDVT ) constitute approximately 10 % DVT . A recent increase incidence largely secondary increase use peripherally inserted central venous catheter . Treatment UEDVT derive evidence treatment low extremity deep vein thrombosis ( LEDVT ) . No evidence exist use direct oral anticoagulant ( DOAC ) treatment UEDVT . Population : Sequential patient identify within Intermountain Healthcare system University Utah Healthcare system UEDVT define formation thrombus within internal jugular , subclavian , axillary , brachial vein arm demonstrate imaging . Intervention : Apixaban 10 mg PO twice daily 7 day follow apixaban 5 mg twice daily 11 week . Comparison : In primary analysis , principal investigator report rate clinically overt objective VTE VTE-related death comparison rate report upon literature review ( `` reference value literature '' ) . If confidence interval rate excludes commonly accept threshold event rate 4 % , principal investigator conclude treatment apixaban noninferior , therefore clinically valid approach treat UEDVT . As secondary analysis principal investigator compare rate primary efficacy outcome primary safety outcome historical control case match patient UEDVT ( `` historical control '' ) treat therapy conventional ( low molecular weight heparin plus warfarin ) prior approval DOACs . Sample Size : A sample size 357 patient meet eligibility criterion choose exact 95 % confidence interval would exclude event rate venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) observation cohort 4 % . The principal investigator add 5 % anticipate withdrawal assure adequate patient enrollment case patient withdrawal enroll 375 patient . Outcome : 90 day rate new recurrent objectively confirm symptomatic venous thrombosis VTE-related death . The primary safety outcome major bleed clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be â‰¥ 18 year age Have receive four ( 4 ) dos anticoagulant , intravenous bridge heparin longer 60 hour Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start study drug . Women must breastfeed WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives study drug apixaban ( 3 day ) plus 30 day ( duration ovulatory cycle ) total 33 day posttreatment completion . Males sexually active WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives study drug apixaban ( 3 day ) plus 90 day ( duration sperm turnover ) total 93 day posttreatment completion . Azoospermic male WOCBP continuously heterosexually active exempt contraceptive requirement . However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy test described section . Another indication longterm anticoagulation FDA approval apixaban exists ( e.g . prosthetic heart valve ) Life expectancy le 6 month Unable engage reliable followup per protocol Participating conflict clinical trial participate trial within last 30 day Receiving concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy Requires aspirin dose great 165 mg daily A hemoglobin level less 8 mg per deciliter A platelet count le 50,000 per cubic millimeter A calculate creatinine clearance le 25 mL per minute Alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase level great 2 time upper limit normal range A total bilirubin 1.5 time upper limit normal range . Active cancer treatment ( chemotherapy/radiation therapy ) deliver , imminent , deliver within last 6 month For patient receive ELIQUIS 5 mg 10 mg twice daily , dose ELIQUIS decrease 50 % coadministered drug strong dual inhibitor CYP3A4 Pgp ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , clarithromycin ) . For patient receive ELIQUIS dose 2.5 mg twice daily , avoid coadministation strong dual inhibitor CYP3A4 Pgp . Intend pregnancy breastfeed within next year Known allergy apixaban , rivaroxaban , edoxaban Active pathological bleeding . Any condition discretion investigator think prohibit active participation followup trial UEDVT occur therapeutic anticoagulation take patient ( `` event therapy '' ) The patient concomitant VTE diagnose elsewhere ( e.g . DVT Of low extremity PE )</criteria>
