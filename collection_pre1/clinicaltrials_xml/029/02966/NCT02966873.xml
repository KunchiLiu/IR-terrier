	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Alcohol Use Disorder Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective propose Phase II study evaluate effect N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , reduce ( 1 ) Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) severity ( 2 ) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) symptomatology among individual ( N=200 ) current AUD PTSD . We also use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) investigate neural circuitry neurochemistry underlie comorbid AUD/PTSD prognostic indicator positive treatment response . Secondary objective evaluate effect NAC impairment associate area function ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , sleep , risky behavior ) . In order accomplish ( 1 ) employ intent-to-treat , double-blind , placebo-controlled randomize controlled trial consist 12 week treatment NAC ( 2400 mg per day ) placebo medication ; ( 2 ) examine standardize , repeat dependent measure clinical outcome baseline , week 6 , week 12 , 3- , 6- , 12-month follow-up ; ( 3 ) employ advance neuroimaging methodology , laboratory cue paradigm , collect biologic measure alcohol consumption . All participant also undergo weekly individual cognitive behavior therapy session ( CBT ) .The follow specific aim propose : Specific Aim 1 : To determine efficacy N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , compare placebo , reduce alcohol use severity ( i.e. , total standard drink , percent day drinking , abstinence rate ) craving . Specific Aim 2 : To determine efficacy N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , compare placebo , reduce self-report clinician-rated PTSD symptomatology . Specific Aim 3 : To use multimodal neuroimaging technique investigate pathophysiology underlie AUD comorbid PTSD , prognostic indicator treatment outcome . The propose study answer critical question regard potential NAC effective pharmacotherapy AUD comorbid PTSD , elucidate possible mechanism underlie improved outcome . This study particular advantage build directly positive preliminary finding ( 1 ) test NAC treatment individual co-occurring AUD/PTSD use double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized design ; ( 2 ) measure function related area , depression risky behavior ; ( 3 ) employ innovative measurement include neuroimaging laboratory cue paradigm ; ( 4 ) employ multidisciplinary team expert successfully collaborate past uniquely qualified implement type investigation . This project directly responsive mission National Institute Alcohol Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) new AUD/PTSD initiative seek evaluate promising therapeutic agent treatment AUD/PTSD identify neurobiological mechanism common AUD/PTSD potential treatment target . The finding study potential significantly improve standard patient care , advance comorbidity science area , decrease public health expenditure associate AUD comorbid PTSD .</detailed_description>
