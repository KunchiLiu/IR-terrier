	<brief_summary>Heart disease number one killer amongst chronic disease around world , responsible take life estimate 17.5 million people year . Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program , help heart patient improve current health , prevent future heart problem , improve quality life , effective strategy lower risk heart-related death heart patient . CR program currently patient perform moderate intensity , continuous exercise ( MICE ) , traditionally take form walking , jogging , cycle comfortable pace 30-60 minute . Recently , aerobic interval training ( AIT ) , involve perform short bout exercise , typically range 15 second four minute near maximal effort , follow period recovery rest , emerge effective strategy MICE lower risk heart-related death heart patient . Although initial finding appear hold much promise improve CR program future , important recognize woman underrepresented included study date . Therefore , goal study determine effect AIT versus MICE risk heart-related death , blood vessel health , brain health woman heart disease , refer six-month , outpatient CR program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Women With Coronary Artery Disease Investigating Effects Aerobic Interval Training Versus Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigate effect AIT versus MICE aerobic exercise capacity , endothelial function , cognition , woman , CAD refer six-month , outpatient CR program Toronto Rehabilitation Institute ( TRI ) -Cardiac Rumsey Centre . Study participant report Rumsey Centre one day per week combination supervise exercise session educational seminar workshop , perform four additional unsupervised , home-exercise session per week target total five exercise session per week . Recruitment Sampling Immediately completion symptom-limited intake CPA , previously identify eligible patient would screen eligibility upon referral six-month , outpatient CR program TRI-Cardiac Rumsey Centre ask either Cardiopulmonary Exercise Technicians , Lab Coordinator perform initial CPA , would interested speak researcher learn potential participation research study . If patient agree speak researcher , researcher meet patient person immediately follow CPA explain study obtain voluntary , write informed consent applicable . Patients provide opportunity take consent form home , discuss participation study spouse family member , etc. , take much time require decide whether participation study desirable option . If , patient provide write informed consent participate study , randomize computerized random number generator ( operate blind third party researcher ) either six-month standard care CR program offer TRI-Rumsey Centre involve MICE , 6-month AIT intervention . Both MICE AIT arm study consist patient attend one , supervise exercise session per week TRI-Rumsey Centre , perform four additional unsupervised home-exercise session per week total five exercise session per week goal . The AIT Intervention The AIT Group begin one-month , `` run-in '' period patient perform current standard care CR programming , involve traditional MICE . MICE Cardiac Rumsey Centre consist either track walking/jogging treadmill walking/jogging approximately 30-40 minute , perform intensity 60-80 % VO2peak , addition warm-up cool period . In second month study intervention , patient begin perform AIT three day per week , one AIT exercise session occur Rumsey Centre supervision , 2 session per week MICE , consist 30-40 minute walking/jogging intensity 60-80 % VO2peak , allot warm cool period . The AIT Exercise Protocol Upon examination recent RCTs investigate AIT versus MICE 2004 2016 , specifically CAD population , AIT intervention group experience great improvement VO2peak , translate ~1.5-2 mL kg-1 min-1 improvement compare MICE ( control ) group . These result compelling , particularly context potential 10-25 % reduction cardiovascular mortality risk beyond would confer standard care MICE prescription . In almost 90 % recent RCTs compare effect AIT versus MICE aerobic exercise capacity CAD patient , AIT exercise protocol consist 4x4 minute interval treadmill walk either 80-90 % VO2peak , 85-95 % HRpeak , 80-90 % Heart Rate Reserve ( HRR=HRpeak-resting HR ) , 3 minute active recovery 4-minute interval , perform intensity ~50-70 % VO2peak , HRpeak , HRR . Therefore , remain consistent previous literature support AIT CAD patient , AIT exercise protocol participant execute study consist follow component : 1 . Warm Up Period : 5-10 minute walk perform 50 % -60 % VO2peak and/or correspond HR ( ~60 % -70 % HRpk ) and/or RPE ~10-12 Borg Scale 2 . Intervals : Four 4-minute interval walking/jogging performed intensity 85-95 % VO2peak , &gt; 90 % HRpk , and/or RPE &gt; 17 Borg Scale , intersperse 3-minutes active recovery perform intensity ~50 % -70 % HRpk 3 . Cool Down Period : 5 minute walk performed intensity 50-70 % HRpk , and/or RPE ~10-12 Borg Scale Understanding must cognizant fact study participant may respond progress AIT intervention different rate , intention begin two 4-minute interval first week AIT intervention , progress participant perform three , eventually four 4-minute interval fourth week intervention , i.e . end Month 2 study/CR program timeline . The decision progress patient accordingly make judiciously upon deliberation researcher cardiac rehabilitation supervisor/case manager study participant .</detailed_description>
