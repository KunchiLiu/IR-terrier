	<brief_summary>The purpose study find successful ibrutinib put follicular lymphoma full remission . In study , remission determine achieve normal PET scan treatment . A PET scan image test look active lymphoma . People n't complete remission PET first treatment high risk lymphoma return . This study investigate ibrutinib help participant achieve complete remission without give additional chemotherapy . The study also investigate possible side effect study drug ibrutinib .</brief_summary>
