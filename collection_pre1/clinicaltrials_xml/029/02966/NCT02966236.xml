	<brief_title>Impact Tranexamic Acid Use Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Kidney stone high incidence prevalent disease affect people around world . Nearly 1 11 individual United States affect point life . Furthermore , stone likely recur least 50 % individual experience another stone within 10 year first occurrence . Moreover , disease mainly affect economically active segment population special social economic implication health . Approximately 85 % stone compose predominantly calcium compound 7 % attribute urinary tract infection , name struvite stone , usually develop jagged structure call `` staghorns '' grow quite large , therefore become complex kidney stone . However , HCFMUSP , Brazilian national reference center urolithiasis treatment , complex stone represent 30 percent renal lithiasis treat . This complex stone require individualized specialized treatment , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) standard care , advantage high stone clearance cost-effectiveness compare treatment alternative . However , PCNL associate significant morbidity fever , urinary infection , septicemia bleeding may require blood transfusion . Of complication bleed unpredictable dread , lead significant morbidity , beyond potential risk blood transfusion . In way antifibrinolytic drug , tranexamic acid , show reduce blood loss variety surgical procedure , blood transfusion rate , morbidity mortality relate bleeding . Objectives : The main outcome measure study evaluate impact tranexamic acid use blood transfusion rate patient complex kidney stone undergo PCNL ( number patient receive blood transfusion surgery hospital discharge ) . The secondary outcome evaluate blood loss hemoglobin measure , surgical time , stone free rate complication . Furthermore , want corroborate drug safety , previously establish medical literature . Methods : After protocol approval hospital ethic committee , patient undergo PCNL complex renal stone ( GUYS classification III IV ) provide write informed consent , eligible trial . After patient ' eligibility confirm , randomly allocate intervention placebo group computer program . Trial participant , care provider , surgeon , anesthesiology team data collector blind group assignment . Patients manage surgical standardized technique Endourological HCFMUSP group control care surgery . Blood transfusion rate , hemoglobin drop complication evaluate 7 , 30 , 90 180 day surgery . On postoperative day one , CT scan perform ass stone free rate complication .</detailed_description>
