	<detailed_description>rTMS appear potential new non-invasive antidepressant method , imply non-convulsive focal stimulation brain time vary magnetic field . ) . RTMS base principle electromagnetism . An electromagnetic coil place scalp produce time-varying magnetic field penetrates scalp skull unattenuated give rise current proximity cerebral cortex well functionally connect part brain . Research rTMS report minimal side effect method Previous research indicate antidepressant effect rTMS associate specific stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . The stimulus frequency show play key role mechanism action rTMS . Previous animal study show low frequency rTMS associate long term inhibition neuronal activity ( long term depression ) , high frequency stimulation follow prolonged activation ( long term potentiation ) . To extent , differential effect different frequency reflect human study ( REF ) . The majority clinically control study use high frequency stimulation leave frontal cortex , approve USA FDA ( 1 ) later EU treatment depression . Fewer study use right prefrontal , less side effect , local discomfort low risk release epileptic seizure , high frequency stimulation . In addition low frequency rTMS generally less time-consuming . Both stimulus model show modest , statistically significant antidepressant effect recent research clearly indicate low frequency rTMS right prefrontal cortex associate antidepressant effect level high frequency model . The issue indicate low frequency due advantagous side effect profile stimulus model choice clinical setting . Therefore investigator want examine antidepressant effect specific rTMS low frequency model clinical set use placebo control , randomize double blind design .</detailed_description>
