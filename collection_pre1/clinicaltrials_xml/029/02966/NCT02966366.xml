	<brief_title>Tinnitus Treatment With Cochlear Implant Single Sided Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Continuous surgical , technological audiological advance responsible ever improvement outcome obtain cochlear implant ( CI ) last decade . These positive observation progressively lead cautious extension CI indication include patient single-sided deafness ( SSD ) . SSD patient characterize loss functional hear one ear , cause impairment binaural hearing ability , important difficulty sound localization speech noise comprehension . These patient also often present invalidate tinnitus deaf ear , worsen psychological audiological condition . Recent study report successful reduction tinnitus intensity cochlear implantation . However , study include limited number participant tinnitus evaluation tool . The impact CI speech perception ability SSD still debate . Objective : This study aim assess effect CI electrical stimulation tinnitus , speech-in-noise speech-in-quiet ability group 30 SSD patient . Methods : After cochlear implantation , patient stimulate use continuous white noise stimulation first month period thereafter use conventional stimulation . This do investigate effect non-meaningful , therefore peripheral , stimulation . Outcomes monitor 1 , 3 , 6 12 month CI use . Tinnitus loudness annoyance measure Visual Analog Scale tinnitus distress quality life evaluate tinnitus questionnaire ( THI , TRQ STSS ) . Speech noise comprehension assess three different spatial listening configuration speech quiet evaluate direct connection speech processor .</detailed_description>
