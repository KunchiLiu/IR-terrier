	<detailed_description>The study complete two part , prospective , single-centre , randomise control trial . Five volunteer ( dentist ) recruit first part study order evaluate examine microneedle device use . Based qualitative finding ( individual interview focus group ) modification microneedle device implement part two study commences . Twenty healthy male volunteer invite participate second part study . Participants randomly assign receive dental anaesthetic solution injection microneedle device ( Group I ) standard thirty-gauge short hypodermic needle ( Group II ) first week second part study . Group I : The microneedle device apply randomly leave right buccal mucosa ﬁrst premolar tooth maxilla order inject slowly standard local dental anaesthetic solution . Group II : A standard thirty-gauge short hypodermic needle use insertion injection standard local dental anaesthetic solution randomly leave right buccal mucosa ﬁrst premolar tooth maxilla . Quantitative qualitative measurement pain experienced depth anaesthesia achieve record group compare . In order eliminate carryover effect , washout period one week receive second , opposite injection apply ( i.e . Group I receive injection standard thirty-gauge short hypodermic needle Group II injection microneedle device ) . The buccal mucosa ﬁrst premolar tooth untreated , opposite maxilla side receive injection remain injection method follow procedure describe first week .</detailed_description>
