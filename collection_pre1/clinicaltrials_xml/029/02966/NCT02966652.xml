	<brief_summary>DITEST oral formulation native testosterone treatment androgen deficiency men . The propose study Phase 1 clinical study hypogonadal men , define accord FDA Endocrine Society Guidelines , design evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) characteristic DITEST , assess safety tolerability DITEST target population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Compare DITEST Testosterone Undecanoate Adult Men With Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct male subject 18 80 year age require testosterone replacement therapy primary secondary hypogonadism . The study randomise , active control , single dose , 2-way cross-over study 2 cohort . In cohort subject meet entry criterion screen baseline randomise one 2 sequence : Cohort 1 : single dose 120 mg ( 3 x 40 mg ) DITEST follow single dose 80 mg ( 2 x 40 mg ) testosterone undecanoate single dose 80 mg ( 2 x 40 mg ) testosterone undecanoate follow single dose 120 mg ( 3 x 40 mg ) DITEST . The two treatment separate minimum 7-day washout period , treatment give fed state . Cohort 2 : single dose 200 mg ( 5 x 40 mg ) DITEST ( feed ) follow single dose 200 mg DITEST ( fast ) single dose 200 mg DITEST ( fast ) follow single dose 200 mg ( 5 x 40 mg ) DITEST ( feed ) . The two treatment separate minimum 7-day washout period . 12 subject recruit cohort , result total 24 subject administer study medication study ( note subject Cohort 1 enter Cohort 2 ) . Subjects recruit Cohort 2 result subject treat Cohort 1 evaluate ( review determine intend dose Cohort 2 need adjust ) . No testosterone treatment allow duration study ( include washout period ) . Each subject require attend study centre minimum either 4 5 visit : screening assessment , evaluation baseline testosterone level washout period subject 's current medication ( subject currently testosterone replacement therapy ) , dose day , follow-up visit end study . There unmet need native oral testosterone therapy men androgen ( testosterone ) deficiency . Ideally treatment reproducible PK , need take fatty meal , take twice daily , provide physiological exposure testosterone . This Phase 1 , randomise , open-label , 2-cohort , cross-over study therefore design evaluate PK characteristic DITEST fed fast state accord FDA guideline , assess safety tolerability DITEST target population .</detailed_description>
