	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery rectal cancer successfully proven non-inferior alternative regard resection quality , oncological outcome patient compare open surgery mangy clinical trail . Moreover , laparoscopic surgery advantageous open surgery regard operative invasiveness , patient 's recovery , wound related complication . Thus , laparoscopic surgery gain great popularity past decade . However , specifically mid low rectal cancer , laparoscopic surgery technically demand , sometimes lead high morbidity unsatisfactory resection quality , especially challenge case bulky mesorectum , enlarge prostate , irradiated pelvis , etc . Under circumstance , transanal total mesorectal excision ( TaTME ) , call `` down-to-up '' alternative , emerge promising solution problem recent year small study prove feasibility advantage technique , make become hot topic among literature conference . However , TaTME still early birth , higher-level evidence , either multicentric , comparative study conventional surgery strikingly lack . Thus investigator conduct multicentre randomise clinical trial , compare transanal TME versus laparoscopic TME mid low rectal cancer , aim prove hypothesis TaTME may achieve good resection quality result non-inferior oncological outcome , well short term operative morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transanal Versus Laparoscopic Total Mesorectal Excision For Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In recent year , transanal mesorectal excision ( TaTME ) emerge promising surgical alternative rectal cancer , especially mid low rectal cancer . Theoretically , TaTME hold potential advantage provide good access mobilize distal rectum , thus could achieve good pathologic outcome , low involve circumferential margin ( CRM ) incomplete resect mesorectum , could translate good oncological outcome patient long term . However , , feasibility non-inferiority ( compare laparoscopic total mesorectal excision , LpTME ) technique validate study limitation small sample size , retrospective nature . Study Objective : This study aim evaluate TaTME technique compare conventional laparoscopic rectal surgery , focus resection quality , well long-term survival result . Study design This study prospective , multi-center , randomize , open-label , parallel group trial . The randomisation ratio TaTME LpTME 1:1 . A central electronic data capture ( EDC ) system utilized randomization , electronic CRF data collection . All comparative analysis conduct `` intention treat '' basis . Sample size : The project 3-year disease free survival rate conventional laparoscopic surgery group 77 % . According noninferiority design , randomisation ratio 1:1 , generate power 80 % ( base α 0.05 margin delta ( δ ) 10 % ) expect dropout rate 20 % , determine total 1114 patient require inclusion trail ( 557 patient group ) . Study Endpoints : The primary end point study 3 year disease free survival ( DFS ) . Secondary endpoint include : 1 ) resection quality , mainly include circumferential involvement rate , completeness mesorectum . Resected specimen pathologically process assessed center train qualified pathologist independently.2 ) short term operative result morbidity mortality , etc . ; 3 ) long term oncological outcome local recurrence , overall survival . Besides , functional outcome quality life also evaluate .</detailed_description>
