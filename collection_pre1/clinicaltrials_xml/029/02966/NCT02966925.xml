	<brief_summary>Vulvovaginal irritation frequent complaint among postmenopausal woman . Common symptoms vaginal atrophy include dryness , itching , burn dyspareunia . This pilot study assess efficacy platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) combine hyaluronic acid ( HA ) relieve vulvovaginal dryness patient benefit reference treatment ( hormonal therapy ) .To achieve , 20 patient suffer vulvovaginal dryness treat one session injection vulva , posterior vaginal wall perineum , followed-up 6 month . Improvement vaginal dryness primarily appreciate Friedmann score pH value , secondarily Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) , measure baseline 1 , 3 6 month treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Platelet Concentrate Combined Hyaluronic Acid Obtained With Cellular Matrix® BCT-HA Kit Vulvovaginal Dryness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A treatment rely association platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) hyaluronic acid ( HA ) could represent therapeutical alternative patient suffer vulvovaginal dryness treat hormone therapy . Indeed , hyaluronic acid widely distribute tissue , particularly vulvovaginal tissue . Due hydrate healing property , HA play key role tissue regeneration , facilitate entry large number variety cell injured area , reconstruct way extracellular matrix capable support proliferation differentiation cell tissue regeneration . In addition , ability retain water 1000x weight make ideal substance ensure hydration skin . Thus , gynaecological use HA could promise therapeutic option treatment vulvovaginal dryness . On hand , numerous study show role PRP heal soft hard tissue . PRP autologous preparation patient 's blood playing role growth factor reservoir treatment . Indeed , platelet activation induce alpha-granules degranulation , release synthesize pre-packaged growth factor . Once release , growth factor induce different cell signal cascade activate angiogenesis , cell proliferation , cell differentiation new matrix synthesis tissue regeneration . A recent clinical study show PRP could significantly reduce sexual distress patient suffer dyspareunia suggests PRP could improve vaginal vascularization physiologic responsivness patient vaginal atrophy . In present pilot study , combination PRP/HA obtain Cellular Matrix inject vulva , vaginal wall perineum woman vulvovaginal dryness . Outcomes compare various timepoints treatment .</detailed_description>
