	<brief_summary>This first-time-in-human , phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study HMPL-453 patient advance metastatic solid malignancy fail intolerable standard therapy standard therapy exist . There preliminary two stage study : dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) dose-expansion stage ( stage 2 ) . We decide whether conduct stage 2 one month last patient include stage 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study Assess Safety Tolerability HMPL-453 Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) : Patients participate dose-escalation stage take single dose HMPL-453 Day 1 follow one week safety observation . After one week observation , safety issue occur , patient continue multiple dose HMPL-453 QD start DLT assessment cycle . Each cycle consist 28-days . Patients required draw blood sample PK safety analysis specific time point treatment . The 3+3 design employ dose escalation MTD determination . To limit number patient expose potentially ineffective dos , one patient enrol dosed initial dose cohort . If DLT &lt; 2 CTCAE grade 2 toxicity occur first treatment cycle , study escalate next dose cohort . Otherwise , trial revert standard 3+3 design . Dose-Expansion Stage ( Stage 2 ) : This stage evaluate safety , tolerability , PD profile , preliminary anti-tumor activity HMPL-453 RP2D approximately 10 patient advance solid tumor . Patients FGFR dysregulated advanced solid tumor , include limited , advanced gastric cancer , advance urothelial bladder cancer , advance cholangiocarcinoma ( patient cancer gallbladder ampulla Vater eligible ) prefer enrol . Expansion stage begin dose-escalation stage complete MTD/RP2D determine . Patients receive HMPL-453 28-day treatment cycle disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity , long benefit study treatment per investigator 's discretion , withdrawal consent , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
