	<detailed_description>Rationale : The evaluation protein quality identify top priority question Food Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) United Nations . However , current available method precisely estimate protein quality , need invasive procedure . The propose 'dual tracer approach ' non-invasive method evaluate protein quality human . Objective : The present project characterize use 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein reference-protein development non-invasive method use ass protein quality human subject . For purpose , primary objective define digestive metabolic behaviour distribution reference 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein compare internal standard 13C-spirulina different amount 2H-labelled test protein ( case also milk ) . Study design : Randomized cross-over trial two experimental meal . Study population : Healthy male female , age 18-35y Intervention ( applicable ) : On two separate test day , subject receive semi liquid meal ( pudding ) divide 9 portion , ( 500 Kcal ; meal 1 : 35 En % Protein,10 En % fat , 55 En % carbohydrates ; meal 2 : 25 En % Protein,10 En % fat , 65 En % carbohydrate ) , make combination jelly pudding , water intrinsically label 15N 2H milk protein powder . Furthermore , meal contain trace amount 13C-labelled algae protein internal standard . Meals differ amount ( e.g . 10g 25g ) 2H-labelled milk protein . Main study parameters/endpoints : The ratio isotopic enrichment ( 15N/13C 2H/15N ) ( total ) amino acids test meal blood plasma determine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : A meal challenge intrinsically label protein addition stable isotope tracer frequently use postprandial study . Stable isotope naturally occur isotope harmful subject , decay . Furthermore , place venous catheter blood sample occasionally cause local haematoma bruise participant may report pain discomfort . Subjects come research facility three time , screen visit 1 hour , 2 experimental day 4 hour . Subjects financially compensated participation .</detailed_description>
