	<brief_summary>The STAR-study ( STay Active Rehabilitation ) investigate randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) additional effect pedometer-based behavior change intervention ( BCI ) in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) objectively measured physical activity ( PA ) 6-weeks 6-months post PR . The BCI use behaviour change technique ) instruction , perform behavior , b ) prompt goal set physical activity , c ) prompt self-monitoring behavior ) feedback behavior . The primary outcome PA measure use accelerometer ( Actigraph wGT3X ) time period seven day , firstly two week rehabilitation begin ( T0 = study phase I ) well six week six month ( T3 T4 ) PR . Additionally predict PA progression PR , complex personal diagnostic , include questionnaire well functional assessment , carry start ( T1 = start study phase II ) end PR ( T2 ) . This diagnostic base main idea PA-related health competence model ( PARC-model ) especially incorporate physical psychological personal determinant PA .</brief_summary>
