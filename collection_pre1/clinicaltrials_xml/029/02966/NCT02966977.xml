	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effect extension conventional urine diagnostics mass spectrometry patient suspect UTI . Mass spectrometry do directly urine sample ( without intermediate bacterial culture ) .The primary outcome time entry urine sample microbiological laboratory adequate/optimal/definitive treatment . Secondary outcome time diagnosis therapy relevant UTI , quantity antibiotic prescribe per patient ward comparison length hospital stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extending Urine Analysis By Direct Mass Spectrometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) high incidence rate one main reason initiate antibiotic therapy , , ambulatory hospital setting . Mass spectrometry improve sample preparation allow same-day identification cause agent UTI . This could shorten time suboptimal potentially harmful empirical therapy . Additionally adverse effect development resistance apply antibiotic agent could diminish . Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization ( MALDI ) â€” Time Flight ( TOF ) Mass Spectrometry ( MS ) ( MALDI-TOF MS ) already prefer identification method increase number laboratory since outperforms biochemical identification speed precision . This study try evaluate new method identify cause agent UTI evaluate clinical implication . This research project clinical trial intend analyse urine patient suspect urinary tract infection mass spectrometry . This patient material conventionally process retrieve particularly study purpose . Health-related personal data collect patient ward Clinic Internal Medicine University Hospital Basel urine sample analyse study period . No health-related personal data particularly collect study .</detailed_description>
