	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease With Arsenic Trioxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) common long-term complication patient underwent allogeneic transplantation . First-line therapy chronic GVHD base immunosuppressive agent ( corticosteroid without cyclosporine ) achieve satisfactory response around 30 % patient . This prospective , national , multicenter , non-randomized Phase II study include total number 24 patient , trioxide d'arsenic administrate 0,15mg/kg/day . Clinical response evaluate base Working Group Report 2015 , publish National Institute Health Consensus . Follow-up visit weekly four week ( ATO cycle ) , every two week second third month ATO treatment , every month fourth sixth month ATO treatment every 3 month , 9 month 12 month ( final visit ) .</detailed_description>
