	<brief_title>Thalidomide/Dexamethasone Treatment And PET Evaluation In Organ Involvemenet Cardiac Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering dismal prognosis amyloidosis attributable organ dysfunction , primary aim amyloidosis treatment organ reversal . However , due various reason , much know organ reversal amyloidosis . Almost clinical trial evaluate hematologic response amyloidosis . Meanwhile , besides autologous stem cell transplantation high-dose melphalan conditioning , hematologic response rate various agent bortezomib , melphalan , thalidomide lenalidomide similar amyloidosis . However , organ reverse potential agent know . If difference organ reverse potential despite similar hematologic response rate , drug effective organ reverse potential standard treatment amyloidosis . The investigator assume thalidomide could make organ reversal cardiac amyloidosis due specific mechanism action . To prove concept , investigator propose clinical trial evaluate organ reverse potential thalidomide cardiac amyloidosis .</detailed_description>
