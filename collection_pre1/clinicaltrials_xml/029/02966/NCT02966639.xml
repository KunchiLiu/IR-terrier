	<brief_title>Validation Appropriateness Criteria Surgical Treatment Lumbar Degenerative Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal stenosis common reason lumbar surgery patient age 65 , substantial proportion stenosis patient present concomitant lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis ( LDS ) . This condition characterize anterior translation vertebra due degenerative change facet joint disk , commonly L4-L5 , prevalent woman age 50 . The translation commonly result spinal stenosis , patient tend present various combination low back pain , radiculopathy , neurogenic claudication . The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial ( SPORT ) demonstrate good outcome patient treat surgery compare non-operative treatment . However , patient meet strict inclusion criterion include presence radicular pain neurogenic claudication , cross-sectional image demonstrate spinal stenosis consistent symptom , duration symptom three month . Additionally , specific patient disease characteristic show significantly affect surgical non-operative outcome . While literature make clear surgery result well outcomes non-operative treatment `` average '' LDS patient , surgeon help make treatment decision patient diverse array characteristic positive negative effect surgical outcome . Additionally , many LDS patient meet inclusion criterion SPORT , extrapolate result patient inappropriate . The currently available evidence provide surgeon general principle help guide decision-making inform decision-making individual patient level . Many study evaluate effect specific patient disease characteristic surgical outcome spinal stenosis . These generally show bad surgical outcome patient medical psychological comorbidities , low socioeconomic status educational attainment , smoker , predominant back pain , receive worker ' compensation , patient involve litigation . However , subgroup analysis SPORT degenerative spondylolisthesis cohort , first study evaluate predictor surgical non-operative LDS outcome , demonstrate factor tend predict bad surgical non-operative outcome . As result , subgroup tend similar treatment effect surgery ( i.e . relative advantage surgical compare non-operative outcome ) even absolute degree improvement surgery less . While data suggest LDS patient meet SPORT inclusion criterion improve surgery non-operative treatment , many LDS patient meet SPORT inclusion criterion , evidence need provide treatment guideline patient . In ideal world , randomized-controlled trial ( RCT ) would perform multiple subgroup order compare outcome among available treatment option . The SPORT LDS RCT demonstrate difficulty perform seemingly straightforward RCT compare surgery non-operative treatment , 64 % patient assign surgery undergone operation within 2 year , 49 % patient randomized non-operative treatment undergone surgery 2 year . Given possible perform sufficiently power RCTs compare surgical non-operative outcome multiple LDS subgroup , method must consider generate guideline help surgeon LDS patient select appropriate treatment base individual characteristic . One alternative RAND appropriateness method ( RAM ) , combine detail review literature modify Delphi panel approach create appropriateness criterion base collective expert opinion . A major strength RAM involve high level clinical detail , allow treatment recommendation make base number relevant patient disease characteristic apply individual patient . The RAM widely use studied several group various country relation different spinal problem . The RAM consider useful procedure use frequently , associate substantial amount morbidity and/or mortality , consume significant resource , wide variation among geographic area rate use , whose use controversial . All criterion apply procedure commonly use surgical treatment LDS . Depending definition success , success rate 1 year surgery range 50 % 94 % . The rate lumbar fusion United States Medicare population show vary nearly 20-fold across hospital referral region . In SPORT LDS cohort , significant difference find across different study center patient ' baseline neurological deficit , stenosis location severity , number stenotic level well functional outcome 4 year surgery . High level geographic variation frequently attribute uncertainty appropriate treatment give condition , usually reflect lack strong evidence . Given lack treatment recommendation apply individual LDS patient level , international group expert convene use RAM create appropriateness criterion surgery LDS.3 The RAM process include 14 expert USA , UK , Belgium , Sweden , Norway , Spain , Switzerland , Hungary background orthopaedic surgery , neurosurgery , rheumatology , physical medicine . The expert consider appropriateness decompression alone , uninstrumented fusion without decompression , instrument fusion without decompression 744 patient scenario . The variable define scenario include symptomatology ( back pain , radicular pain , and/or neurogenic claudication ) , severity neurological deficit , presence significant foraminal and/or central stenosis , level disability , presence significant medical comorbidities , clinically relevant `` instability '' , presence significant psychosocial `` yellow flag '' . The appropriateness type surgery rat 1-9 scale ( 1-3 inappropriate , 4-6 uncertain , 7-9 appropriate ) two separate round expert panel . Surgery one type another consider appropriate 27 % scenario , uncertain 41 % , inappropriate 31 % . In general , scenario symptom limit back pain absence instability consider inappropriate surgery , whereas presence radiculopathy claudication , neurologic deficit , instability increase likelihood scenario consider appropriate surgery . The presence medical comorbidities `` yellow flag '' decrease likelihood scenario consider appropriate surgery . There widespread disagreement appropriate use instrumentation , , general , fusion variety likely consider appropriate presence back pain instability . The RAM successfully employ develop appropriateness criterion LDS surgery . Prior widespread clinical implementation , result need validated LDS population . If validate successfully , computer-based algorithm could develop help surgeon patient select treatment use appropriateness criterion . This would represent significant advancement share decision make LDS , effectively move population-based recommendation apply individual patient level .</detailed_description>
