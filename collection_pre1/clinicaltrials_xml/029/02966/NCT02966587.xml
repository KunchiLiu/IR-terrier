	<brief_title>Durvalumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate durvalumab metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patient microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , response rate define either accord modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion reduction prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level &gt; = 50 % . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine percent mCRPC patient MSI achieve radiographic response per modify RECIST 1.1 criterion follow treatment durvalumab . II . Determine percent mCRPC patient MSI achieve reduction PSA level &gt; = 50 % follow treatment durvalumab . III . Determine radiographic progression free survival ( PFS ) hypermutated mCRPC patient MSI treat durvalumab use modify RECIST 1.1 criterion soft tissue metastasis Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 ( PCWG3 ) criteria bone metastasis . IV . Determine PSA PFS rate accord PCWG3 criterion hypermutated mCRPC patient MSI treat durvalumab . V. Determine time response hypermutated mCRPC patient MSI treat durvalumab use modify RECIST 1.1 criterion . VI . Determine overall survival hypermutated mCRPC patient MSI treat durvalumab . VII . Determine change PSA double time 12-weeks initiation durvalumab . VIII . Track pain assess Brief Pain Inventory course treatment durvalumab . IX . Assess incidence severity adverse event accord National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine mismatch repair gene mutational status mutational load ( UWOncoPlex ) . II . Determine mismatch repair gene mutational status , mutational load microsatellite stability circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) and/or cell-free tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) . III . PD-L1 expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) transcript profile ( e.g . quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [ qRT-PCR ] ) . IV . Determine relative location T-cells within tumor microenvironment ( i.e . stroma vs. tumor edge ) use CD3/CD8 IHC . V. Evaluate tumor specific T-cell response blood within tumor microenvironment use next generation sequence assay . OUTLINE : Patients receive durvalumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 4 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 month , every 6 month .</detailed_description>
