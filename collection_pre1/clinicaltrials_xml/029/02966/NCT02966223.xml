The investigator hope use functional model liver , investigator improve important knowledge gap . The investigator enrol patient plan receive Y-90 therapy treatment liver malignancy . The diagnosis primary liver cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , usually make combination specific image finding clinical criterion ; rarely confirmatory biopsy perform .

Y-90 therapy involve administer radioactive particle liver tumor place catheter hepatic artery supply tumor use angiographic technique injection particle . Y-90 PET/CT imaging establish method validate quantitate distribution Yttrium Y-90 administration . The post Y-90 therapy PET/CT image provide image distribution Y-90 , essential validation administer versus plan dose liver lesion background liver . If investigator compare Y-90 distribution estimate background liver radiation distribution dose ( generate Y-90 PET/CT scan ) combine global regional function map ( generate HIDA scan perform therapy ) , investigator assume difference pre post therapy global regional function ascribe Y-90 administration .

	<detailed_description>Little known potential relationship Y-90 liver therapy liver damage subject . Present assumption calculation Y-90 administration base surgical lobar hepatectomies external radiation beam therapy . As participant need Y90 base liver therapy compromise liver , importance know potential collateral liver damage could induce Y90 key induce liver failure . Successful treatment liver malignancy would important potential mortality/morbidity risk treatment high equal exist malignancy . As apposed anatomical image look change size/shape late change , investigator hope use functional model liver , show early change liver damage , investigator improve sensitivity detection liver damage bridge important knowledge gap . Additionally due compensatory hypertrophy non treat liver , potential liver damage estimate lab test may mask , emphasize importance measurement functional approach therapy . The investigator enrol participant plan receive Y-90 therapy treatment liver malignancy . The diagnosis primary liver cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , usually make combination specific image finding clinical criterion ; rarely confirmatory biopsy perform . This due high accuracy present diagnostic model significant risk biopsy tumor seed . Y-90 therapy involve administer radioactive particle liver tumor place catheter hepatic artery supply tumor use angiographic technique injection particle . Y-90 PET/CT imaging establish method validate quantitate distribution Yttrium Y-90 administration . The post Y-90 therapy PET/CT image provide image distribution Y-90 , essential validation administer versus plan dose liver lesion background liver . The investigator perform specialized nuclear medicine HIDA MRI scan aim construct functional map liver 3 month therapy . The investigator compare Y-90 distribution estimate background liver radiation distribution dose ( generate Y-90 PET/CT scan ) combine global regional function map ( generate HIDA MRI scan perform therapy ) , investigator assume difference pre post therapy global regional function ascribe Y-90 administration . The investigator also analyze MRI NM data set perform therapy correlate imaging result collect clinical finding ascites/encephalopathy routine serological marker ( bilirubin , albumin , INR , etc. ) . With information , investigator potential establish whether relationship Y-90 distribution non-tumoral ( normal ) hepatic parenchyma incidence severity REILD . This would potential improve selection criterion outcomes population select Y-90 therapy future .</detailed_description>
