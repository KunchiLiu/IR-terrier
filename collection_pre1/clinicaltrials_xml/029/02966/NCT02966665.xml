	<brief_summary>Many control mechanism exist successfully match supply blood metabolic demand various tissue wide-ranging condition . One primary regulator vasomotion thus perfusion muscle tissue host chemical factor originate vascular endothelium muscle tissue , collectively set level vascular tone . With advance age many disease state , deleterious adaptation production sensitivity vasodilator vasoconstrictor substance may observe , lead reduction skeletal muscle blood flow compromise perfusion muscle tissue . Adequate perfusion particularly important exercise meet increase metabolic demand exercise tissue , thus condition reduces tissue perfusion may limit capacity physical activity . As well establish regular physical activity key component maintain cardiovascular health advance age , clear need study population vascular dysfunction compromise , goal identify mechanism responsible dysfunction explore whether maladaptations may remediable . Thus , good understand etiology vascular adaptation health disease , current proposal design study change vascular function advance age , also examine peripheral vascular change patient suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , Sepsis , Pulmonary Hypertension , cardiovascular disease . While clearly host vasoactive substance collectively act govern vasoconstriction rest exercise , four specific pathway may implicate identified population : Angiotensin-II ( ANG-II ) , Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , Nitric Oxide ( NO ) , oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Angiotensin-II ( ANG-II ) end-product renin-angiotensin cascade , act potent endogenous vasoconstrictor bind angiotensin receptor ( AT1 ) arteriolar vascular smooth muscle . With advance age , notable decline plasma renin activity accompany decrement circulate ANG-II increase AT1 receptor density . However , functional consequence age-related adaptation renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) peripheral circulation well understood . Likewise , recent year become apparent cardiovascular disease major cause morbidity COPD , may relate vascular dysfunction associate adoption sedentary lifestyle . In patient , change RAS activity link peripheral vascular dysfunction , compel evidence improvement peripheral oxygen use follow angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibition . Like age population , systematic study evaluate AT1 receptor sensitivity efficacy AT1 receptor blockade peripheral hemodynamics undertaken . The ubiquitous substance nitric oxide ( NO ) recognize key pathway endothelium-dependent vasodilation , bioavailability NO serve indicator overall vascular health . Cardiac risk factor show cause impairment endothelial vasodilator function peripheral coronary artery . Coronary vascular dysfunction important phase atherogenesis associate myocardial ischemia . Furthermore , peripheral vascular function link coronary vascular dysfunction could important clinical implication term health screening . Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation associate elderly , patient COPD , cardiovascular disease include pulmonary hypertension , heart failure ( HF ) , though functional consequence adaptation peripheral blood flow regulation remain unclear . Thus , propose use compound inhibits enzyme responsible NO production endothelial cell , N-monomethyl-L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) , temporarily block production NO thus determine importance pathway rest physical activity . Additionally , propose use acetylcholine ( Ach ) determine endothelial-dependent vasodilation sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) nitroglycerin ( NTG ) determine endothelial-independent vasodilation coronary artery periphery . Oxidative stress associate age show reduce vascular function antioxidant supplementation restores vascular function level indistinguishable healthy young adult . The manner improvement vascular function occur know may act NO dependent mechanism . Histamine report mediate sustain post-exercise vasodilation histamine-1 ( H1 ) histamine-2 ( H2 ) receptor activity , result ~50 % elevation femoral artery blood flow ( rest level ) last 100 minute single bout moderate-intensity dynamic exercise . Vasodilation markedly reduce give either fexofenadine ( Allegra , selective H1-receptor antagonist ) ranitidine ( Zantac , selective H2-receptor antagonist ) . The combination H1/H2 blockade abolishes ~80 % post-exercise vasodilation see whole-body exercise cycling observation observe multiple study young sedentary , recreationally active , endurance train men woman . The impact histamine post-exercise vasodilatory response substantial ; however , role H1/H2 receptor regulate skeletal muscle blood flow exercise unknown . Thus , intend investigate role H1/H2 receptor regulation skeletal muscle blood exercise may important pathway age disease related reduction blood flow exercise . Exercise training rehabilitation use alternative approach combat deleterious effect oxidative stress age disease . An effective exercise training intervention decrease sympathetic nervous system activity , improve arterial compliance vascular endothelial function , alter pro- antioxidant balance result improve endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism . Moreover , exercise training concomitantly improve musculoskeletal strength function , glucose regulation insulin sensitivity , cardiovascular function , body composition , blood chemistry ( decrease triglyceride cholesterol level ) , overall well-being . The physiologic effect exercise rehabilitation program disease COPD , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) incompletely understood . However , recent study suggest exercise training patient population well tolerate associate clinically significant physiologic improvement well improvement various quality life score . A unique feature propose study identify herein inclusion novel methodological approach comprehensively evaluate functional outcome propose pharmacologic intervention . The recent development unique combination nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) techniques member group enable near-simultaneous measurement muscle perfusion metabolism vivo . The arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) technique allow measurement spatially temporally resolve quantification perfusion , kinetics phosphocreatine ( PCr ) depletion recovery provide high resolution measurement muscle energetics . The interweave imaging spectroscopic module provide opportunity determination skeletal muscle perfusion metabolism kinetics follow stress physical exercise . Thus , NMR-based approach , combine direct measure muscle fatigue , offer potential define individual collective contribution variable attenuate limb blood flow elderly patient COPD PAH . We propose pathway outline represent avenue vascular function compromise elderly patient COPD , PAH cardiovascular disease . However , pathway mutually exclusive , proposed study design systematically evaluate hemodynamic response intra-arterial intravenous administration pharmacologic agent specific AT1 receptor ( ANG-II Diovan , AT1 agonist antagonist , respectively ) , Endothelin receptor Type-A ( ETA receptor ) ( BQ-123 , ETA antagonist ) , NO pathway ( L-NMMA , Ach , SNP ) exercise training .</detailed_description>
