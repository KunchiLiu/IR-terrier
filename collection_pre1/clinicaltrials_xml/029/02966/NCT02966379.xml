	<detailed_description>Some candidate cochlear implantation residual low frequency hear . The EVO electrode lead specifically design preserve residual hearing surgery . It possible provide patient electro-acoustic stimulation ( EAS ) combine acoustical stimulation preserve low frequency hear electrical stimulation cochlear implant . Literature show EAS stimulation lead well speech understanding , especially noisy situation , provide important information intonate melodic contour , thus increase sound quality music perception . Objectives The major aim study evaluate hearing preservation implantation EVO electrode lead . The secondary outcome evaluate benefit EAS stimulation provide Zebra speech processor . Methods Unaided tonal audiogram measure cochlear implant candidate low frequency residual hearing cochlear implantation EVO electrode lead . Aided tonal audiogram speech intelligibility quiet noise measure implantation three mode stimulation ( acoustic stimulation AS , electric stimulation ES , electro-acoustic stimulation EAS ) .</detailed_description>
