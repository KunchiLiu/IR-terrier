	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Implantation Two Multifocal Intraocular Lenses Treatment Senile Cataract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current study Aging-induced degenerative disease lead cause senile cataract . Phacoemulsification intraocular lens ( IOL ) implantation commonly employ surgical technique treatment cataract . A traditional IOL spherical monofocal . Traditional monofocal IOL implantation allow cataract patient obtain good postoperative distance vision loss accommodation result poor near vision . Following monofocal IOL implantation , patient still require use glass . Fortunately , presence multifocal IOLs solve problem . Studies show aspheric IOLs zero negative spherical aberration eliminate reduce spherical aberration whole eye improve contrast sensitivity night vision compare spherical IOL . As first report 1987 Keatea et al. , multifocal IOLs introduce provide improve visual acuity , thus eliminate need wear glass improve patient 's quality life . Increasing evidence-based medicine evidence show multifocal IOLs adept improve near vision single-focus IOLs . To date , various type multifocal IOLs develop accord different design principle , clinically used multifocal IOLs divide refraction type , diffraction type refraction/diffraction type . Introduced 2002 , Tecnis Z9001 diffractive multifocal aspherical IOL ( Abbott Medical Optics , CA , USA ) clinically proven give patient improve contrast vision visual quality compare common IOL , although deficiency include postoperative glare reduce contrast sensitivity . Emerging designs multifocal IOLs aim provide improvement postoperative visual quality . The Acri.LISA 366D multifocal aspheric IOL relatively novel refractive/diffractive multifocal IOL different traditional IOLs . Its unique optical design improve patient 's full vision reduces incidence light scatter , glare halo , expect deliver well clinical outcome . However , long-term clinical performance potential incidence complication still need evaluation . It worth note age increase , increase presbyopia , aberration lens scatter reduces compensation corneal aberration , thereby result decrease visual acuity contrast sensitivity . Given , ideal IOLs good biocompatibility good resolution spherical aberration . Data collection , management , analysis , open access Data collection Clinical data collect manage use electronic data capture system . All data relevant trial record electronic case report form provide sponsor personnel . The case report complete interview . Data management After completion follow-up data confirmation , project manager lock database . The locked data unable alter preserved future reference Affiliated Hospital Qinghai University China . Data analysis All data statistically analyze professional statistician . Open data Published data release http : //www.medresman.org . Statistical analysis All data statistically analyze statistician use SPSS v19.0 software . Normally distributed measurement data express mean Â± standard deviation , non-normally distribute data express quartile median . Categorical variable express count percentage . Two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney U-test use intergroup comparison visual acuity diopter . The chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test use intergroup comparison incidence histocompatibility reaction implant host tissue percentage complication . A value P &lt; O.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
