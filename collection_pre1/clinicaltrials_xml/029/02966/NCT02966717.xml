	<detailed_description>Primary nephrotic syndrome ( PNS ) group clinical symptom cause variety factor , include immune , environmental , genetic , et al . Oral corticosteroid prefer drug treatment PNS , long-term use glucocorticoid therapy clinic often induce problem hormone dependent hormone resistance , well severe side effect act threat patient ' health . On treatment nephrotic syndrome late evidence-based practice guideline , Japan Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) still high-level-evidence recommendation steroid resistant PNS patient renal function significantly impair . In addition , large number patient proteinuria long-term control often behave fast progression chronic renal failure , lead poor prognosis . What 's , patient hold progression 3-4 stage chronic kidney disease nephrotic syndrome ofen tolerate conventional immunosuppressive therapy , thus cause fast progression end-stage renal disease . There well treatment method phenomenon nowadays . Therefore , particularly important explore new treatment option clinical disease describe . In renal disease , Rituximab ( RTX ) often use treatment refractory nephropathy , hormone dependent nephrotic syndrome , hormone resistance nephrotic syndrome , frequency recurrence nephrotic syndrome , show excite effect delay development disease . An observational、 multicenter、 retrospective study therapeutic effect RTX adult minimal change nephrotic syndrome ( MCNS ) conduct . This study confirm RTX safe effective treatment adult patient MCNS , use alternative treatment option MCNS patient long-term recurrence . Whereas , whether rituximab treatment PNS ( MCNS type NS ) combine CKD play role delay progression renal disease , relevant clinical trial report . At present , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) use research hotspot repair tissue damage chronic kidney disease , also behave certain effect . Clinical Studies treatment PNS umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell treatment CKD bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell suggest mesenchymal stem cell improve patient 's condition PNS CKD . However , cell therapy clinical trial patient CKD rarely see , definitive conclusion . Accordingly , clinical study need assess effectiveness , feasibility safety cell therapy , well formulate standard treatment plan . We accumulate 3 case patient chronic kidney disease ( 3-4 stage ) , accompany large number proteinuria renal function decline rapidly , provide RTX infusion combine mesenchymal stem cell . Of , 3 patient significantly reduce proteinuria , 2 case show different level improvement renal function , 1 case keep stable renal function . There obvious adverse reaction safety risk , clinical trial still require . In addition , team carry project autologous non-clearing bone marrow stem cell transplantation treatment severe lupus associate renal function impair . This study reveal good treatment effect , provide certain clinical work foundation experience follow research . In summary , intend conduct prospective、 single-center、 randomize 、controlled clinical study , unite Third Affiliated Hospital Southern Medical University together explore effectiveness safety rituximab combine mesenchymal stem cell treatment PNS ( CKD3-4 ) . The purpose study seek target treatment , precise curative effect feasibility treatment PNS ( CKD3-4 ) , delay reverse disease improve quality life patient CKD .</detailed_description>
