	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( HF ) impose burden patient health economics . Although guideline exist , implemented Belgian health care system . General practitioner ( GPs ) confront broad range HF management . Therefore , multifaceted intervention implement Belgian general practice support GPs implementation evidence-based HF guideline . This multifaceted intervention consist audit feedback method detect unrecognized HF patient increase awareness proactive HF management . Additionally , NT-proBNP point-of-care test offer every practice improve detection adequate diagnosis HF patient . Furthermore , specialist HF nurse assist GPs education patient , optimization treatment transition care . The investigator ' aim evaluate feasibility implementation multifaceted intervention general practice evolution predefined quality indicator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol Pilot Study Optimize Care Heart Failure Patients Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective pilot study assess feasibility multifaceted intervention optimize care HF patient Belgian general practice . It primary objective study effectiveness intervention define outcomes , since follow-up might short , however evolution quality evaluate . Specific research question : 1 . Do general practitioner use NT-proBNP POC test influence practice ? 2 . Do general practitioner use assistance HF nurse influence practice ? 3 . Does intervention improve quality care HF patient primary care ? 4 . Does intervention improve quality life HF patient primary care ? 5 . Is intervention/data collection method feasible ? How participate GPs investigator experience intervention ? Data collection : - Measurements baseline 6 month follow-up - Baseline demographic data patient age , gender , year since diagnosis HF , cardiovascular comorbidities ( hypertension , ischemic heart disease , valvular heart disease , atrial fibrillation , cerebrovascular disease , peripheral arterial disease ) , non-cardiovascular comorbidities ( diabetes , depression , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , dementia ) , last two blood pressure measurement , last 2 creatinine measurement last two value estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , last date GP consultation , involvement cardiologist ( yes/no ) , last date cardiologist appointment , echocardiography ( yes/no ) , last date echocardiography report , ejection fraction ( EF ) , diastolic dysfunction ( yes/no ) , clinically relevant valvular dysfunction ( yes/no ) , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( yes/no ) , leave atrial enlargement ( yes/no ) heart failure treatment dosage ( diuretic , ACE-I , ARB , B-blockers , MRA , digoxin ) collect . Additionally , number chronic medication number chronic comorbidities collect . Furthermore , MLHF-Q collect evaluate patient ' quality life grip strength ( baseline ) predictor functional decline , disability mortality . At baseline , HF hospitalization last three year register base discharge letter EHR . All hospitalization mortality collect practice level study course . Data physician age , gender , year experience practice organization ( group/single-handed/number practitioners/EMHS ) request well . Patient level Outcomes : All data extract EHR general practitioner patient satisfy eligibility criterion . Data extract baseline 6 month . First , baseline 6 month , patient register diagnosis HF identify EMHS . Demographic data extract automated search ; data need collect manual chart review . Additionally , identify HF patient visit HF nurse baseline 6 month ask fill MLHF-Q . At occasion grip strength measure dominant hand use JAMARÂ® Plus digital hand-held dynamometer . Three attempt maximal squeeze record . Process evaluation : GPs ask fill study registration form indication result NT-proBNP POC test use influence decision-making . The HF nurse keep log action . Consequence action collect patient ' medical record . GPs ask take note HF nurse advice EHR indicate influence decision-making . Experiences GPs investigator : The feedback meeting 6 month organize focus group GP practice get insight experience participate physician investigator . The meeting audiotaped type . Any harm result trial explicitly collect report . Practice level Impact intervention hospitalization mortality study pilot trial , however , later stage would outcome large cluster-randomized trial , therefore , feasibility collect data hospitalization mortality test . These outcome measure practice level patient age 40 year old , enlist one participate GP practice . GPs ask register date death cause death EHR patient die study course . A list hospitalized patient participate GP collect surround hospital ( ZOL Genk , AZ Vesalius , Jessa Hasselt ) hand GPs . Cause hospitalization deduct discharge letter EHR GP standardize manner ( trained principal investigator ( PI ) ) . The anonymized data hand PI . Data management : Data collection data entry do PI assist data manager . All patient data cod anonymized . All author full access cod data ( include statistical report table ) study able take responsibility integrity data accuracy data analysis . Data analysis : Descriptive statistic provide regard baseline variable HF patient general practitioners/general practice . Outcomes measure study intervention compare chi-squared test . Experiences participate GPs investigator analyze qualitatively use thematic analysis method . Ethics : Before study start investigator present participate physician informed consent outline intervention purpose trial . Additionally , identify HF patient visit HF nurse start study . On occasion HF nurse inform HF patient study outline purpose ask inform consent . Furthermore , patient eligible NT-proBNP POC test inform GPs study outline purpose ask informed consent . However , informed consent seek patient practice level ( hospitalizations/mortality ) . Therefore , information study intervention purpose trial present poster practice , visible patient , opt-out object study participation .</detailed_description>
