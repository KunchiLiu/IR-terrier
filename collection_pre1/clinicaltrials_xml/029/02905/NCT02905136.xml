	<brief_summary>Neurological psychiatric diseases one major health problem worldwide . Decades fundamental clinical research lead model disorder result synaptic imbalance excitatory , inhibitory modulatory system key brain structure . Although network neurotransmitter system involve delineated , mechanisms lead improper neurotransmissions remain poorly understood . One major limitation lay difficulty transpose identify dysregulation human relevant animal model molecular cellular target manipulate . The amino-acid glutamate mediates vast majority excitatory neurotransmission mammalian brain . We know glutamatergic synapsis change strength regulate surface expression dynamic postsynaptic receptor , change receptor recycle and/or lateral diffusion . This synaptic plasticity underlies higher cognitive function learn memory likely compromise several disease state . Regulating glutamate receptor number function thus primary importance . New subcellular imaging technique render possible study receptor traffic receptor regulation various condition include pathological model open new fundamental question . Moreover , recent breakthrough glutamate receptor structure offer unprecedented clue molecular structural mechanism underpin receptor dysfunction atomic level . Recently , description encephalitis associate specific autoantibody ( Abs ) direct neuronal synaptic receptor protein ( NSA-Abs ) open new light pathophysiological mechanism human brain disorder . The best example frequent syndrome synaptic autoimmune encephalitis associate autoantibody extracellular domain glutamatergic NMDA receptor ( NMDAR-Abs ) . Classically , patient first present psychiatric symptom hallucination bizarre behavior development neurological symptom seizure , dyskinesia , autonomic instability . Despite severity neuropsychiatric symptom , 80 % patient fully recover immunomodulatory treatment many argument suggest direct role NMDAR-Abs symptom . The investigator recently demonstrate NMDAR-Abs directly modify , synaptic level , NMDAR lateral diffusion disruption interaction NMDAR EphrinB2 receptor , synaptic protein anchor NMDAR synapse ( Mikasova et al , Brain 2012 ; Dupuis et al , EMBOJ 2014 ) . These data suggest NMDAR-Abs could directly participate neuropsychiatric disorder observe patient NMDAR dysfunction could directly responsible observe symptom . Furthermore , data suggest NSA-Abs direct synaptic protein could explain specific neurological symptom patient encephalitis associate NMDAR-Abs . The aim MECANO combine multidisciplinary approach ( clinical , immunological , neurobiological one ) identify new NSA-Abs , characterize specific pathological role decipher acute chronic NMDAR-Abs effect biophysical structural property NMDA receptor , synaptic plasticity , neuronal morphology , cognitive performance . This project provide key insight onto effect patient ' NSA-Abs cellular dynamic regulation synaptic protein receptor molecular cascade activate synapse dysfunction . The investigator investigate NSA-Abs binding alter receptor activity , modify surface receptor mobility dynamically regulate maturation synapses circuitry . For purpose , The investigator use unique combination high-resolution imaging ( single nanoparticle track ) , receptor engineering , cellular electrophysiology , computational ( structural modeling ) cellular molecular biology approach finally behaviour assay . Based cutting-edge neurobiology clinical expertise autoimmune disorder , strengthen promising preliminary experiment , MECANO project likely open new avenue fundamental research understand synaptic dysfunction clinical research treatment neuropsychiatric disorder .</brief_summary>
