	<brief_summary>The study intervention involve study addition dose volasertib part initial chemotherapy regimen AML . The trial involve combination follow drug : - Volasertib ( study drug ) - Idarubicin - Cytarabine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volasertib Combined With Induction Chemotherapy Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational drug also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . As part research study , participant receive Volasertib combination two chemotherapy drug , Idarubicin Cytarabine . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve volasertib treatment disease . Idarubicin Cytarabine chemotherapy agent commonly use treat individual diagnose AML . Volasertib inhibit protein call `` polo-like kinase , '' necessary cell division . Volasertib bind proteins inhibits growth cancer cell . Volasertib use laboratory study study suggest volasertib may slow growth Cancer . In previous clinical trial patient participant type leukemia Volasertib give along low dos Cytarabine , drug find clinical activity AML . In study , researcher would like combine Volasertib standard chemotherapy ( Cytarabine Idarubicin ) order see give safely chemotherapy individual AML . The primary purpose research study determine high dose Volasertib give Idarubicin Cytarabine without severe unmanageable side effect . The dose identify study use future research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must pathologically confirm , newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia . Adults , age 18 year old time diagnosis , eligible standard induction chemotherapy accord treat physician . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % measure echocardiogram MUGA scan Must receive systemic antineoplastic therapy include radiation therapy within 14 day study enrollment , except hydroxyurea 6mercaptopurine purpose cytoreduction per treat physician . Patients may also receive alltrans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) early suspicion acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL , M3AML ) , although confirm APL patient exclude study . Female patient childbearing age must negative pregnancy test . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : total bilirubin &lt; 3 time ULN creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . The effect volasertib ( BI 6727 ) develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , 6 month completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception duration study participation , 6 month completion therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients exclude study find harbor `` favorable '' risk cytogenetics41 include : APL , ( 15 ; 17 ) ( 8 ; 21 ) inv ( 16 ) ( 16 ; 16 ) A sample evaluate patient cytogenetics send time diagnosis per standard clinical care absence cytogenetics must confirm Day 8 . If cytogenetic analysis reveals patient harbor favorable risk cytogenetics , cytogenetic result receive prior Day 8 , participant remove study . Patients acute bilineal/biphenotypic leukemia Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 14 day prior enter study , except hydroxyurea , 6MP , ATRA , note . Participants receive investigational agent . Chemo , hormono , radio immunotherapy therapy monoclonal antibody small tyrosine kinase inhibitor within past 4 week prior treatment trial drug Persistence clinically relevant therapy relate toxicity previous anticancer therapy Prior allogeneic bone marrow organ transplantation Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Current clinical central nervous system ( CNS ) symptom deem investigator related leukemic CNS involvement ( lumbar puncture require , clinical assessment per investigator 's judgment sufficient ) . Prior treatment volasertib another pololike kinase inhibitor A diagnosis active Hepatitis B C infection . A patient prior infection may participate , long infection active time study screen test accord investigator discretion . Current history ventricular lifethreatening arrhythmias diagnosis longQT syndrome . Baseline QTc must 470 msec less , accord Friderica correction method,42 calculate mean 3 ECGs take time screen . Current history congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , history document diastolic systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 50 % , measure MUGA scan echocardiogram ) . Known hypersensitivity trial drug contraindication standard `` 7+3 '' induction chemotherapy . Although absolute exclusion criterion , several know drugdrug interaction consider enrollment ( see Section 5.5 ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study volasertib , along standard induction chemotherapy , carry potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother volasertib well cytarabine idarubicin , breastfeed avoid . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction volasertib . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Patients psychological , familial , social , geographic factor otherwise preclude give informed consent , follow protocol , potentially hamper compliance study treatment followup . Patients otherwise felt unable comply protocol , opinion investigator .</criteria>
