	<brief_summary>Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ( PIH ) acquire hypermelanosis occur cutaneous inflammation injury frequently affect darker skin population . Previously , model 35 % TCA-induced PIH validate acne induced PIH , value product test treatment PIH . In second phase study , investigator would like determine low concentration TCA-induced PIH comparable acne-induced PIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ( PIH ) acquire hypermelanosis occur cutaneous inflammation injury . This process occur skin type frequently affect darker skin patient , African-Americans , Hispanics , Asians , Native Americans , Pacific Islanders Middle Eastern descent . PIH occur infection , allergic reaction , contact dermatitis , medication , burn , follow procedure , inflammatory disease acne . In skin color , PIH frequently occur resolve acne lesion persist month acne lesion disappear . In many case , result PIH distress original insult . During first phase study , investigator investigate clinical , spectroscopic histologic characteristic acne-induced PIH versus irritant induce PIH use Trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) , 35 % solution . From initial study , investigator conclude similarity Investigator 's Global Assessment score , spectroscopic measurement use Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy Colorimetry acne TCA-induced PIH Day 28 suggest TCA-induced PIH could reproducible model acne induce PIH . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) class small non-coding RNA molecule regulate expression multiple gene post-transcriptional level degradation translation target mRNAs . In initial study , investigator hypothesize miRNAs derive melanocyte immune cell PIH development could detect tissue serve novel biomarkers PIH make appropriate therapeutic decision . To test hypothesis , investigator first examine miRNA gene expression profile PIH development use different model , evaluate miRNAs profile acne- induced PIH , TCA- induce PIH normal skin . The investigator define miRNAs potentially involved PIH development may also serve biomarkers PIH . The investigator find 19 miRNA change acne-induced PIH versus normal skin , 43 miRNA change TCA-inducedPIH versus normal skin . Interestingly , 80 % change gene acne include TCA-mediated miRNA change , suggest TCA partially mimic acne-PIH . Overall , initial model PIH , use TCA , serve foundation well understand improve ability manage PIH . In next phase study , investigator refine vivo model PIH determine optimal concentration TCA induce PIH .</detailed_description>
