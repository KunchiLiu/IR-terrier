	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1.1 Risk/Benefits Risks : Anticipated risk participation study minimal . This similar relaxation intervention test inconvenience side-effects report . Adverse event , irrespective causal relationship , collect participant Benefits : The direct benefit participant include opportunity receive relaxation intervention show helpful term decrease pain rating anxiety improve quality sleep similar setting . 1.2 Treatment/ Dose Rationale The evidence-based multimodal intervention ( duration : 55min ) base literature review recommendation American Holistic Nurses Association ( 31 ) successful pilot ( 10 ) . Multimodal integrative intervention demonstrate superior efficacy compare uni-dimensional one ( 32 ) . It include : ) relaxation guide imagery ( RGI ) ( 40 min , headphone ) , b ) brief moderate pressure massage session ( massage : 15 min ) . RGI involves : ) guide relaxation , b ) structure guided imagery script c ) music 15 min ( Mozart piano sonata KV283 , G major ( 2 3 ) II Andante ) . Moderate pressure , low velocity ( 4 N , 1-5cm/s ) massage consist squeeze movement wide area contact apply follow order reverse order , 2-3 min site : trapezius muscle , lateral arm , forearm , foot temple forehead area . Moderate pressure massage use elicits parasympathetic activation , oppose light pressure ( 33 ) . The intervention administer daily ( 10-11am ) 5 consecutive day train intervention nurse involve patient care . The intervention start soon possible ICU admission , terminate upon patient 's transfer discharge ICU . Selection time intervention base daily schedule unit , minimize interference routine care . A 5-day intervention select patient develop delirium within first 5 day ICU admission ( 28 ) . 1.3 Trial Conduct This study conduct compliance protocol approve University Alberta Health Research Ethics Board ( HREB ) , accord Good Clinical Practice standard . No deviation protocol implement without prior review approval HREB . Participants : Adult critically ill patient meet eligibility criterion . Recruitment : Consecutive patient admit 2 academic teach ICUs Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) : 0-3 screen research assistant admission protocol recruit research nurse . 2 . Trial Objectives Goal : assess clinical trial feasibility treatment effect estimate multimodal intervention incorporate RGI moderate pressure massage prevention ICU delirium improvement physiological psychological outcome critical illness . 3 . Trial Design 3.1 Primary Study Endpoints/Secondary Endpoints Please see 3.2 Study Design/Type Design : Pilot feasibility , randomize , control , double-blinded ( clinician , outcome assessor ) trial 2 parallel group ( intervention standard care group ) . Accounting major risk factor delirium ( 28 ) , stratify randomization accord age ( &lt; 65 , ≥65 ) surgical injury trauma ( Trauma/ Surgery , non-Trauma/ surgery ) block 1:1 allocation assure balance number per group employ . 3.3 Randomization Allocation-sequence generation concealment : Participants randomly assign either control intervention ( 1:1 allocation ) per computer generate randomization schedule , generate Epidemiology Coordinating Research Centre ( EPICORE ) , University Alberta ( UoA ) , stratify site , age ( &lt; 65 , ≥65 ) , presence surgical injury trauma use permuted block random size . Blinding : Clinicians , outcome assessor , research assistant , nurse laboratory technician blind group allocation . Participants blind . A sham intervention silent headphone mask audio component , presence intervention nurse bedside drawn curtain use . Blood sample code-identified vial maintain blind . Assessments regard outcomes conduct assessor blind treatment allocation . 3.4 Duration Duration participation : The total duration participation approximately 14 week . Duration participate vary depend length patient ' stay ICU hospital . Time point include : baseline measurement , follow-up ICU 5 day , follow 48-96 h ICU discharge , follow-up 3 month hospital discharge . Participant timeline : Based patient population characteristic participate ICUs , eligibility rate expect 40 % recruitment rate 30 % eligible patient , yield estimate recruitment period 6-8 month . 3.5 Discontinuation Intervention discontinuation : For give participant intervention may discontinue ( session may cancel ) participant legal surrogate wish . If participant skip one session remain protocol , remaining session administer per study protocol . Reasons miss session report analyzed . Sessions may cancel intervention discontinue case report harm , abrupt worsen delirium and/ patient anxiety . Adverse event , irrespective possibility causal relationship , collect participant recruitment long participant remain protocol , report . 4 . Selection Withdrawal Subjects 4.1 Inclusion Criteria Please see 4.2 Exclusion Criteria Please see 4.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria subject withdrawal : 1 ) Active withdrawal study participant . 2 ) Loss contact . 3 ) Evidence trial-related harm . 4 ) Assessment premature termination trial relate intervention indicate , e.g . belatedly identify violation criterion inclusion and/or exclusion imply premature termination therapy 5 ) Non-compliance subject indicate premature termination trial relate intervention . 1 . Documentation clinical trial continue even trial related therapy terminate prematurely , expect participant specifies documentation terminate . 2 . Subjects replace duration participation le 24 hr . 3 . Adverse event observe , irrespective withdrawal trial . 4.4 Medication No restriction regard concomitant medication . Standard care continue concomitantly participant per unit protocol clinician ' decision . Pain treat present sedative titrate maintain lightly sedate state ( RASS= -1- -3 ) . 4.5 Monitoring subject compliance To assure adherence , intervention administer trained research nurse , involve participant ' care , randomly audit TSC ensure protocol compliance , especially respect touch massage procedure . Deviation intervention record detail intervention nurse immediately intervention session . 5 Assessment Safety 5.1 Safety Parameters Any physiological/ behavioral alteration intervention record analyse . Adverse event , irrespective causal relationship , collect participant . 5.2 Adverse Event Reporting &amp; Follow-up The time period adverse event ( AE ) serious AE ( SAE ) report begin begin intervention , continue throughout intervention , end 30 min end intervention session . All adverse event occur reporting period record AE/SAE Report Form , categorize degree expectedness , relatedness severity.. The clinical course adverse event follow resolution , stabilization , determine study treatment participation cause . 6 Statistical Plan 6.1 Statistical Methods Statistical method : Demographic/ clinical characteristic patient outcomes presented treatment group use descriptive statistics— mean ( SD ) , median ( IQR ) proportion . Outcomes analyze longitudinally 5 day logistic regression model base generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) AR ( 1 ) correlation structure . ANCOVA , t-test Mann-Whitney test , appropriate , conduct continuous outcome longitudinal . Chi-square exact test , appropriate , use categorical outcome . Confidence interval present estimated effect . \A significance level alpha=0.05 employ . 6.2 Subject Population ( ) Analysis 60 subject per arm/ 60 subject per site . Total 120 subject . Sampling consecutive ICU patient accord inclusion/ exclusion criterion . This pilot power determine difference primary outcome , since aim ass estimate effect . Participants include 120 patient ( 60 per site ) attain high probability equivalence baseline , precision estimate , able employ appropriate repeat measurement procedure estimation effect accrue experience large clinical trial ( 34 ) . 6.3 Termination Criteria 1 . Alterations current clinical practice make trial procedure longer feasible . 2 . Reaching positive negative statistical end point earlier anticipate . 3 .
