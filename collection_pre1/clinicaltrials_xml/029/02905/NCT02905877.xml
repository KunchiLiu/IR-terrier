	<brief_summary>Functional disorder , also call psychogenic psychosomatic common , disable cost society immense . Functional movement disorder abnormal , involuntary movement , illogical term classic neurology . Intriguingly , typically manifest patient pay attention disappear distraction . The investigator aim understand pathophysiological mechanism underlie functional neurological disorder order improve treatment . In particular aim understand effect attention movement general , functional neurological mechanism sense agency ( subjective control ) movement . Patients functional neurological disorder , patient organic neurological disorder healthy participant perform simple task , reach target , additional task manipulate attention . The effect attentional manipulation analyse several level : movement performance , analyse kinematics electromyography ( EMG ) , psychophysical measure , sense agency , neural correlate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . If hypothesis turn true , change attentional focus could use treatment functional neurological disorder .</brief_summary>
