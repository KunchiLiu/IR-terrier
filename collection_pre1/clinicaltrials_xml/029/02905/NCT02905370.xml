	<brief_title>Progressing Home Health Rehabilitation Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Declines physical function result acute illness strongly independently associate number adverse health event old adult . Home Health ( HH ) physical therapy may ideal venue address decline physical function around 3 million old adult receive HH service follow discharge acute post-acute facility . However , currently structure , HH care appear adequately restore function , evidence poor long-term outcome high rate hospital readmission . Diminished physical function particularly implicate risk factor re-hospitalization -- old adult low level ambulatory activity 6 time likely re-hospitalized great ambulatory activity . A intensive approach HH physical therapy older adult great potential maximize physical function reduce hospital readmission . Therefore , investigator develop high intensity home-based , progressive , interdisciplinary , multi-component ( PMC ) intervention directly address functional deficit see hospitalization . This intervention include intensive rehabilitation , care transition program , daily protein supplementation . The investigator conduct two-arm , randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) 200 participant admit HH acute post-acute facility . Participants receive either 1 ) intensive , PMC intervention use resistance exercise evidenced-based motor control train improve physical function , along nutritional supplementation emphasis functionally enhance care transition 2 ) usual care ( UC ) physical therapy . The primary goal investigation determine PMC intervention , initiate upon admission HH , improve physical function , measure performance self-report assessment , UC physical therapy . The investigator also examine effect fatigue , balance confidence , activity daily live . In exploratory analysis , effect PMC intervention re-hospitalization rate , nursing home placement , emergency room visit , fall discharge acute care hospital also examine . All outcome examine baseline , 30 , 60 ( primary endpoint ) , 90 180 day . If successful improve patient function decrease re-hospitalization rate , PMC intervention hold potential future health care cost saving .</detailed_description>
