	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial High-dose Ascorbate Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One standard treatment metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine . This standard therapy administers chemotherapy per week three week ; patient get 'rest week ' complete cycle ( 1 cycle = 4 week ) . This study add 75 gram ascorbate ( vitamin C , sometimes call pharamcological ascorbate dose high ) standard therapy . The ascorbate administer intravenously - vein arm . Participants : - receive 75 gram ascorbate 3 time per calendar week week chemotherapy cycle . - undergo image standard cancer therapy . This include CT scan , PET scan , X-rays - provide blood sample determine biological effect , , ascorbate body therapy . This active therapy portion last disease progress new treatment need adopt - month year . If disease progress , participant go back standard follow-up caner new/additional therapy doctor prescribe .
