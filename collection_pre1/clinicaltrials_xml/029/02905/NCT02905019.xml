	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy adjuvanted R21 alone combination viral-vectored vaccine regimen ( constitute adjuvanted R21 + ChAd63 MVA encode ME-TRAP ) malaria sporozoite challenge healthy malaria-naive volunteer . Healthy adult volunteer recruit London , Oxford Southampton , England . All vaccination administer intramuscularly . Each volunteer receive either three five vaccination total , depend group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study R21 +/- ChAd63/MVA ME-TRAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Groups 1-3 consist volunteer receive either R21 alone R21 + ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP follow CHMI sporozoite challenge ( mosquito bite ) week 12 . Groups 4 5 infectivity-control group sporozoite challenge procedure : volunteer vaccinate . Group 4 undergo sporozoite challenge time Group 1-3 volunteer . Group 5 volunteer use infectivity control volunteer Groups 1-3 rechallenged 5 - 7 month initial CHMI . Following vaccine schedule : Group 1 vaccinations- week 0,4 8 Group 2 vaccinations- week 0,4 8 Group 3 vaccinations- week 0,4 8 addition viral-vectored vaccine week 1 9 . A total 12 volunteer recruit vaccine group . After sporozoite challenge , volunteer treat topical anti-histamine ( treatment local inflammatory response ) malaria infection treat oral Riamet ( artemether-lumefantrine ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult age 18 45 year . Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement . Willing allow investigator discuss volunteer 's medical history General Practitioner . Women : Must practice continuous effective contraception* duration study . Agreement refrain blood donation course study least 3 year end involvement study . Written inform consent participate trial . Reachable ( 24/7 ) mobile phone period CHMI completion antimalarial treatment . Willingness take curative antimalaria regimen follow CHMI . For volunteer live Oxford : agreement stay hotel room close trial centre part study ( least day 6.5 post mosquito bite antimalarial treatment complete ) . Answer question inform consent quiz correctly . History clinical malaria ( specie ) . Travel clearly malaria endemic locality study period within precede six month Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day CHMI ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Prior receipt investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data assess investigator . If volunteer Group 13 undergo rechallenge , exclusion criterion extend vaccine previously receive VAC065 trial For Group 3 volunteer : prior receipt nonmalaria MVA nonmalaria adenovirus vectored experimental vaccine Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( e.g . egg product , Kathon ) malaria infection . Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . History clinically significant contact dermatitis . History sickle cell anaemia , sickle cell trait , thalassaemia thalassaemia trait haematological condition could affect susceptibility malaria infection . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Use medication know cause prolongation QT interval exist contraindication use Malarone Use medication know potentially clinically significant interaction Riamet Malarone Any clinical condition know prolong QT interval History cardiac arrhythmia , include clinically relevant bradycardia Disturbances electrolyte balance , eg , hypokalaemia hypomagnesaemia Family history congenital QT prolongation sudden death Contraindications use three propose antimalarial medication ; Riamet , Malarone Chloroquine . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 standard UK unit every week . Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) detect serum . Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) screening ( unless take part prior hepatitis C vaccine study confirm negative HCV antibody prior participation study , negative HCV RNA PCR screen study ) . An estimate , ten year risk fatal cardiovascular disease â‰¥5 % , estimate Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) system.60 Positive family history 1st 2nd degree relative &lt; 50 year old cardiac disease . Volunteers unable closely follow social , geographic psychological reason . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . Any significant disease , disorder , find may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
