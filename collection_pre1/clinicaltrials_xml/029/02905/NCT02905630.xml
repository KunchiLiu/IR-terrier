	<detailed_description>Impaired coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) associate increased mortality patient chest pain despite normal coronary artery ( chest pain normal coronary angiogram ( CPNCA ) ) , . Furthermore , impaired CFR without concomitant impairment regional global leave ventricular function additional prognostic significance . In patient hypertension microvascular dysfunction increase leave ventricular mass ( LVM ) describe sequel . LVM also associate endothelial dysfunction coronary artery remodelling . In addition , patient hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( HOCM ) impair micro vascular cardiac circulation assess PET , document poor prognosis . Also diastolic dysfunction measure Em/Am ratio stress dobutamine echocardiography relate CFR . Patients Diabetes Mellitus impaired prognosis longstanding disease influence microvascular physiology . Several method utilized assess micro vascular function include intracoronary Doppler measurement . CRF assess transthoracic Doppler registration . Several patient angina normal coronary artery show persistence even worsen angina symptom time . . These patient constitute therapeutic problem considerable residual morbidity associate functional limitation reduce quality life . The primary end point treatment patient symptom control . Reduced physical activity one major avoidance behaviour patient coronary heart disease . On hand several study document positive effect ET population . Psychological morbidity great impact daily living well know patient cardiovascular disease patient chest pain obvious physical disease . This include patient CPNCA . These patient constitute relatively large proportion patient take care health authority system indicate issue economic consequence society neglectable2 . Exercise training ( ET ) show improve endothelial function patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) reduce LVM hypertension.. ET also improve endothelial dysfunction reverse inflammation CAD . It also associate improved outcome general population patient CAD heart failure . It document hs-CRP correlate symptom ECG marker myocardial ischemia CPNCA patient . Whether hs-CRP related pathogenesis angina patient deserve investigation . Whether ET may influence pathological reduce CFR currently know . Interventions propose CPNCA patient direct either improve microvascular function decrease chest pain perception , attempt counteract accept pathophysiological mechanisms syndrome . A multidisciplinary approach genuine , sympathetic appreciation health staff devastate effect cardiac syndrome X patient ' quality life usually positive therapeutic impact . Unfortunately , treatment evaluate small number patient and/or uncontrolled trial , thus make difficult establish real degree effectiveness . Tynni Lee 11 investigated effect physical training relaxation therapy exercise capacity quality life patient syndrome X . It first trial report assess effect physiotherapy intervention term quality life patient coronary syndrome X . Female patient syndrome benefit physical training term exercise capacity quality life , relaxation therapy term quality life . However limitation small sample size therefore non-significant finding may due inability detect difference among group . Further study large number patient recommend . Different mode physiotherapy could potential break vicious circle effort-induced chest pain , functional limitation poor quality life patient coronary syndrome .</detailed_description>
