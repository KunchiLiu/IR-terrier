	<brief_summary>Spectral cardiac CT scan perform emergency set patient suspect acute myocarditis present one selves acute chest pain , allow non-invasive assessment coronary artery myocardium . Delayed iodine contrast-enhanced CT imaging show inflamed area increase uptake iodine contrast agent interstitial space , well-known hypersignal see myocardial delayed enhancement sequence MRI ( correspond uptake gadolinium contrast agent abnormal myocardium ) . This technique potential replace MRI , thus allow diagnosis acute myocarditis rapid easily accessible technique . Moreover , additional benefit avoid invasive coronary angiography specific population patient without significant risk factor atheromatous disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : diagnosis acute myocarditis challenge specific population patient without significant risk factor atheromatous disease . Both cardiac MRI coronary angiography ( cardiac CT , invasive coronary angiography ) usually perform definitive diagnosis myocarditis rule coronary artery disease . Spectral cardiac CT could particularly useful suspect myocarditis set acute chest pain specific population patient low cardiovascular risk factor . Indeed , coronary artery myocardial tissue assess technique ( cardiac CT scan ) offer advantages non-invasive , available easily use MRI emergency situation . Cardiac CT allow detection abnormal myocardial territory show subepicardial iodinated contrast enhancement spectral mode imaging . It also allow direct visualization coronary artery , thus prevent necessity perform coronary angiography significant number patient suspect myocarditis set acute chest pain . Primary objective : evaluate diagnostic accuracy spectral cardiac CT image diagnosis acute myocarditis use cardiac MRI gold standard , patient suspect myocarditis set acute chest pain . The diagnosis acute myocarditis use spectral cardiac CT scan base presence late subepicardial contrast enhancement detect use iodine imaging obtain subtraction water image . The gold standard diagnosis acute myocarditis base state-of-the-art MRI criterion . Secondary objective : ass radiation dose deliver spectral cardiac CT scan use late generation machine different manufacturer ( GE Healthcare Siemens ) . Experimental plan : Multicenter diagnostic accuracy study , conduct within scope routine care patient admit suspected acute myocarditis , conduct accord Standards Reporting Diagnostic ( STARD ) guideline . Clinical , laboratory , cardiac MRI , invasive coronary angiography perform routine care . Cardiac MRI serve reference standard definitive diagnosis acute myocarditis . Cardiac CT also perform routine care order rule coronary disease . The investigator add second acquisition use spectral mode image order identify inflammatory area myocardium iodine map imaging . All patient undergo cardiac CT scan spectral mode acquisition cardiac MRI avoid work-up bias . Spectral CT image cardiac MRI perform within 72 hour .</detailed_description>
