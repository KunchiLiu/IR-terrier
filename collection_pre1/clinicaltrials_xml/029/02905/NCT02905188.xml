	<brief_summary>This study enroll patient type cancer arise liver call hepatocellular carcinoma . The cancer come back , go away standard treatment patient receive standard treatment . This research study use special immune system cell call GLYCAR T cell , new experimental treatment . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . Investigators find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . In preclinical study , investigator make several gene call chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) , antibody call GC33 recognize glypican-3 , protein find almost hepatocellular carcinoma cell ( GPC3-CAR ) . This study test T cell genetically engineer GPC3-CAR ( GLYCAR T cell ) patient hepatocellular carcinoma . The GLYCAR T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find big dose GLYCAR T cell safe , see long last body , learn side effect see GLYCAR T cell help people GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glypican 3-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor Expressing T Cells Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( GLYCAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 14 subject participate treatment part study . 180ml blood collect patient grow T cell . The T cell grown retrovirus ( special virus carry GPC3 CAR gene T cell ) use genetically engineer . After CAR gene put T cell , investigator make sure able kill hepatocellular carcinoma cell laboratory . LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY : Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , participant receive treatment cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) fludarabine 3 day receive T-cell infusion . These drug decrease number participant ' T cell investigator infuse GLYCAR T CELLS . WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE : After make cell , frozen . If patient agrees participate study , time patient schedule treat , cell thaw injected patient 5 10 minute . The participant receive GLYCAR T CELLS 24 72 hour complete chemotherapy . The participant may pretreated Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) . Tylenol Benadryl give prevent possible allergic reaction T cell administration . This dose escalation study , mean investigator know high dose GLYCAR T cell safe . To find , investigator give cell least 2 participant one dose level . If safe , raise dose give next group participant . The dose patient get depend many participant get agent patient react . The investigator tell patient information . This help patient think possible harm benefit . Since treatment experimental , likely happen dose know . All Treatments give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital . Medical test treatment : - Physical exam History - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function blood clotting ( INR ) . - If patient infect hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) test measure level virus - Pregnancy test ( patient female get pregnant ) - Measurements patient 's tumor scan tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein ( AFP ) , patient 's tumor produce protein . Medical test treatment : - Physical exam History - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function blood clotting ( INR ) - If patient infect hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) test measure level virus - Measurements tumor maker alfa-fetoprotein ( AFP ) , patient 's tumor produce protein - Measurements patient 's tumor scan ( 6 - 8 week infusion ) - Tumor biopsy ( optional ) FOLLOW-UP STUDIES The investigator follow participant injection . To learn way T cell work participant 's body , 60 mL ( 12 teaspoon ) blood take participant chemotherapy , T-cell infusion , 1 4 hour infusion , 3 4 day infusion ( time point optional ) 1 week , 2 week , 4 week 6 week injection , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year every year next 10 year . Total time participation study 15 year . During time point list , T cell find participant 's blood certain amount extra 5mL blood may need collect additional testing . The investigator use blood look frequency activity cell give ; , learn way T cell work long last body . They also use blood see long-term side effect put new gene ( chimeric antigen receptor , CAR ) cell . In addition blood draw , participant receive cell new gene put , need long term follow 15 year investigator see long term side effect gene transfer . Once year , participant ask blood drawn answer question general health medical condition . The investigator may ask participant report recent hospitalization , new medication , development condition illness present enrol study may request physical exam and/or laboratory test perform necessary . In event tumor biopsy perform clinical reason investigator request permission obtain excess sample learn effect treatment participant 's disease . In event death , investigator request permission perform autopsy learn effect treatment participant 's disease side effect cell new gene . In addition , investigator would like ask participant permission obtain tumor biopsy research purpose . Associated risk biopsy discuss participant detail procedure specific consent form . The investigator test sample see GLYCAR T cell find tumor effect tumor cell . If participant develop second abnormal cancer growth , significant blood nervous system disorder trial , biopsy sample tissue test ( sample obtain ) .</detailed_description>
