Patient understanding diagnosis treatment plan integral compliance , ultimately yield improve medical outcome well quality life . Here investigator report usage advance inkjet 3D printing method develop multimaterial replica patient 's nasal sinus anatomy , derive clinical X-ray Computed Tomography ( CT ) data . The final patient education model develop several iteration optimize material property , anatomical accuracy overall display . A two arm , single center , randomize , prospective study perform 50 ENT surgical candidate ( associate control group , n = 50 ) give explanation anatomy , disease state , treatment option use education model aid . Each patient survey self-rated understanding anatomy , disease , treatment option .</brief_summary>
