	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate add high-dose ascorbate ( vitamin C ) standard therapy non-small cell lung cancer . The standard therapy radiation therapy combine carboplatin paclitaxel ( type chemotherapy ) . All subject receive high-dose ascorbate addition standard therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Adding Ascorbate Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For select stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , standard treatment involve radiation therapy chemotherapy . The chemotherapy regimen typically use paclitaxel carboplatin . Both chemotherapeutic drug administer intravenously , use vein arm . Radiation administer use machine external body ( usually linear accelerator ) . After combined therapy , NSCLC patient receive 2 extra cycle chemotherapy , call `` consolidation chemotherapy . '' This study add 75 gram ascorbate ( vitamin C , sometimes call pharmacological ascorbate dose high ) specific timepoints therapy . The ascorbate administer intravenously - vein arm . Participants : - receive 75 gram intravenous ascorbate 3 time per calendar week receive radiation therapy . The IV run radiation therapy administer . This portion study 6 7 week . - receive 75 gram intravenous ascorbate 2 time per calendar week receive consolidation chemotherapy . Each cycle consolidation chemotherapy 3 week , portion study 6 week . - undergo image standard cancer therapy . This include CT scan , PET scan , X-rays . - provide blood sample determine biological effect , , ascorbate body therapy This active therapy portion last 15 17 week . After do , participant go back standard follow-up cancer additional therapy doctor believe need . However , important investigator remain contact participant ; life-long follow-up study .</detailed_description>
