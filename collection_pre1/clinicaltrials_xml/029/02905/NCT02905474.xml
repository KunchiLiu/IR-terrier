	<brief_summary>Patients complex , long-lasting condition chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) often take multiple medication frequently serious medication problem , arise poor communication doctor patient . Prescription error misunderstanding cause harm lead emergency room visit even hospitalization . To address issue , medication reconciliation use hospital way confirm medication list patient admission discharge hospital . However , similar process exist outside hospital setting . In recent year patient become proactive undertaking activity direct bear health . Such activity may include maintain accurate list medication . The rapid growth digital health arena lead development large number commercially available mobile medication management apps patient . These digital tool 'stand-alone ' product integrate patient ' pharmacy health record system . They rely patient enter list medication update necessary . Moreover , function communicate medication change problem healthcare provider . Recently , integrate smartphone , eKidneyCare , app system develop medication management feature help patient maintain accurate mobile medication list . Patients ' current medication information pharmacy database upload onto pharmacist change track regularly bi-directional communication system . Updates medication list occur seamlessly pharmacist , patient physician notified medication error serious adverse event . This study determine whether eKidneyCare app medication management feature decrease medication error improve patient safety compare traditional way manage medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Patients complicate condition chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high risk problem related medication . Often problem occur doctor patient communicate right type medication information . This cause many prescribe error lead patient harm , emergency visit , hospitalization . To address communication problem , hospital use process call `` medication reconciliation '' confirm medication patient take enter leave hospital . However , way medication reconciliation currently do , patient actively engage give tool effectively communicate medication take , change make , trouble . Directly engage patient process might help solve problem , mobile technology smartphones may solution . Our study team develop mobile application ( app ) call eKidneyCare , specific medication component help patient communicate medication information doctor . This app feed medication information clinic 's medical record patient 's smartphone , change make medication list enter patient sent back central server notify doctor . Study Design : We propose conduct open-label randomize control trial ass medication relate effectiveness stakeholder ' satisfaction eKidneyCare mobile app compare commercially available mobile apps like My MedRec 12 month . This study conduct renal clinic University Health Network oversee clinical management advance stage 4 5 CKD patient end stage renal disease . On average , patient clinic age 65 year take 10-15 medication per day . Objectives Hypotheses Primary 1 ) To evaluate effect eKidneyCare mobile app compare commercially available stand alone mobile app ( My MedRec ) unintentional medication discrepancy CKD patient . The use eKidneyCare app great reduction medication discrepancy rate enhance patient self-care bidirectional communication information . Secondary 1 . To determine effect eKidneyCare mobile app compare commercially available stand along mobile app ( My MedRec ) CKD-specific clinical outcome . Patients actively engage medication management translate improve clinical parameter well blood pressure control . 2 . To evaluate direct cost quality life ( QOL ) associate incorporate eKidneyCare mobile app compare commercially available stand along mobile app ( My MedRec ) . Reduction unintentional medication discrepancy rate offset cost use medication self-care app improve patient ' quality life . 3 . To assess stakeholder ' satisfaction use mobile app manage CKD . Medication self-care app increase satisfaction among patient . This study evaluate app decrease error related medication . It hypothesize patient use app report medication doctor , few error occur , eventually lead reduce patient harm healthcare use .</detailed_description>
