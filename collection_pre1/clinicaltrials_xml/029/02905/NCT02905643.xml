	<brief_summary>One-third primary brain tumor astrocytomas , common type glioma . Grade 4 astrocytomas , commonly know glioblastoma ( GBMs ) , represent 50 % glioma ( annual incidence 3 per 100,000 ) associate high mortality rate median patient survival 12-15 month post-diagnosis . Treatment response assess measure post-treatment tumor size contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) . However , radiation chemotherapy cause inflammatory necrotic change , like actual tumor progression , demonstrate contrast enhancement first post-treatment MRI scan . This enhancement eventually subside ( typically within 6 month treatment ) know pseudoprogression ( PsP ) . Currently , gold standard noninvasive tool distinguish pseudoprogression progressive disease . Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI ( DSC perfusion MRI ) permit measurement hemodynamic imaging variable . Previous literature report attempt use metric assess utility distinguish PsP true cancer progression . These study show mixed result , likely due number factor , include poor statistical power , poorly define PsP , analysis multiple cancer grade type , vary analysis methodology . The investigator aim address issue study .</brief_summary>
