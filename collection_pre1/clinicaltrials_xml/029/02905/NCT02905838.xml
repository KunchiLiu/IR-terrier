	<brief_summary>To assess compare esthetic outcome clinical performance anterior maxillary ceramic implant single crown base either prefabricate zirconia abutment veneer pressed ceramic CAD/CAM ( computer-aided design computer-aided manufacturing ) CARES® abutment veneer hand build-up technique . Participants recruit patient population previously receive dental implant treatment , receive provisional restoration meet inclusion exclusion criterion accord study protocol . After final impression , patient randomise Group A ( prefabricate anatomic abutment ) : one-piece screw retain single crown use press technique ( fluorapatite glass-ceramic , e.max ZirPress ) cut-back technique Group B ( CAD/CAM CARES® abutment ) : one- piece screw retain single crown hand build-up technique ( fluorapatite veneer ceramic , e.max Ceram ) . One week final restoration ( base line visit ) primary secondary outcome parameter assess . The patient follow 5 year final restoration .</brief_summary>
