	<brief_title>A Post Marketing Surveillance Study Triathlon Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All potential total knee arthroplasty patient two consultant orthopaedic surgeon Golden Jubilee National Hospital ( GJNH ) screen relation inclusion/exclusion criterion . Invitation letter participant information sheet ( PIS ) send suitable patient refer GJNH total knee replacement ( allocated patient ) prior pre-operative consultation surgeon . They approach consultation visit seek consent take part study . Patients refer GJNH assessment knee replacement ( see treat patient ) approach deem eligible knee replacement consultant , give copy participant information sheet along invitation letter . They approach consent take part study pre-operative assessment . All patient give opportunity ask question study sign consent form . Consent take chief investigator delegate , use sign form . One hundred patient recruit study . They surgery perform one participate consultant per standard practice target study patient . This involve use Triathlon Tritanium cementless tibial baseplate manufacture Stryker Corporation . Participants receive standard in-patient care rehabilitation . Standard hospital care knee arthroplasty patient return hospital post-operative review 6 week 1 year 7 year operation . Study participant also ask attend GJNH two additional research specific appointment six month five year . They also contact post via telephone complete study questionnaire ( patient satisfaction ) 3 year post operation . During standard care appointment , patient review member arthroplasty team collect routine data clinical functional outcome implant stability . These data include Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ) , EURO Quality life questionnaire ( EQ-5D 5L ) , patient satisfaction standard radiographic assessment implant . Detailed radiographic analysis carry radiograph collect standard specifically study . These post-operation day one ( standard ) , 6 week ( standard ) , 6 month ( study ) , 1 year ( study ) 5 year ( standard ) time point . Study specific radiographic assessment consist assessment radiolucency osteolysis specific region around tibial femoral component . Pre-operatively , standard weight bear long- leg anterior-posterior ( AP ) view , lateral view skyline view obtain per standard care . Post-operatively , standard care consist standard weight bear long-leg AP radiograph 6 week short AP Lateral view review . Study participant also two session specialise functional assessment ( biomechanical movement analysis 6-minute walk test ) operation 1 year operation standard pre postoperative visit . Biomechanical movement analysis carry on-site movement analysis laboratory . Study participant require wear suitable clothing ( e.g . tee shirt short ) barefoot . A number reflective marker attach specific location body use suitable double side tape track number infrared camera . participant ask perform follow task ; walk , step , step , sit-to-stand , stand-to-sit single leg balance . Each task perform least three time enable collection three good set data . In addition , two step task single leg balance repeat limb . A motion capture system collect limb torso movement task performance force plate collect ground reaction force . The 6-minute walk test require participant walk around course six minute period . They allow rest break long often require . They ask stop walking six minute start test distance cover period note .</detailed_description>
