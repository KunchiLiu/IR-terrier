	<detailed_description>1 . Background information 1.1 . Investigational product Ventoline® 0,1 mg/dosis inhalation spray . The active substance Salbutamol . Salbutamol selective β2-agonist induces relaxation bronchial smooth muscle . Common side effect experience 1-10 % chronic Ventoline® user tachycardia , cephalgia tremor . For information product go 12 . Appendix 1 - Product summary , hold Danish product resume The Danish Health Medicines Authority . 1.2 Background Grown-ups congenital heart disease represent constantly grow cohort ( 1,2 ) , birth prevalence 2.62 per 1000 live birth , isolate ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) frequent congenital cardiac malformation ( 3,4 ) . For patient short- long-term follow-up study display low complication rate ( 5-7 ) , VSD-corrected patient assume healthy physically fit compare peer ( 8 ) . Nevertheless recent study demonstrate significant long-term abnormality ( 9-12 ) . Compared normal population similar workload ergometer cycle test demonstrate study ( 13-17 ) whereas study observe subnormal work capacity VSD patient ( 18-20 ) . The recent study , demonstrate significantly low cardiopulmonary exercise capacity ( 9 ) , low force frequency response ( 10 ) , abnormal ventilation pattern compare healthy age gender match control ( 11 ) . How abnormal pulmonary function interrelates impair cardiac function limit exercise capacity remain clarified . None refer study explain mechanism impaired exercise capacity . However , chronotropic incompetence ( 9,14,15,19,21 ) due postsynaptic β-adrenergic desensitization cardiac autonomic nervous system corrective cardiac surgery ( 14,15,19,21 ) suggest . Intrinsic sinus node dysfunction postoperative congenital heart disease patient also demonstrate may explain low exercise capacity ( 22,23 ) . Moreover , abnormal pulmonary function demonstrate patient , may due direct mechanical limitation breathing cause sternotomy patient underwent earlier life . However , may also indirect physiological explanation abnormal exercise ventilation . A previous study find pulmonary function somewhat decrease many standard parameter , perhaps point direction direct mechanical restriction , without clear result ( 24 ) . The study lack reference group healthy control , use standardized pulmonary value instead . Moreover , patient group consist child , adult , make difficult predict long-term outcome group patient . β-adrenoceptors heart ( β1 ) lung ( β2 ) target catecholamine 's cause stimulation sympathetic nervous system among effect bronchodilation positive chronotropic , dromotropic , ionotropic effect heart ( 25 ) . Inhaled β2-agonists commonly use bronchodilator patient condition increased airway resistance ( 26 ) . It long discuss ergogenic potential sport due effect lungs theoretical effect heart . It well describe exercise performance maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2-max ) affect healthy adult ( 27-29 ) even supratherapeutic dos salbutamol test ( 27 ) . However , study mainly perform athlete general population . In patient chronic cor pulmonale moderate chronotropic effect β2-agonist infusion demonstrate ( 30 ) . The effect patient congenital heart disease VSD unknown . Since VSD patient impair pulmonary function well impact chronotropic ionotropic function , might benefit treatment β2-agonists . 2 . Hypotheses A ) Patients surgically correct VSD increase airway resistance rest positively affect inhaled β2-agonists . B ) Patients surgically correct VSD impaired spirometry outcomes positively affect inhaled β2-agonists . C ) Patients surgically correct VSD inferior diffusion lung capacity compare un-operated VSD-patients healthy control . D ) β2-agonists increase peak exercise minute ventilation thereby cardiopulmonary exercise capacity surgically correct VSD patient compare un-operated VSD-patients healthy control . E ) Inhaled β2-agonists increase peak exercise heart rate thereby cardiopulmonary exercise capacity patient surgically correct VSD compare un-operated VSD-patients healthy control . F ) Patients surgically correct VSD reduce heart rate variability , compare un-operated VSD-patients healthy control , positively affect β2-agonists . 3 . Trial design The intend study conduct randomize control blind cross study , two VSD group , match equivalent number control . When write informed consent obtain participant include trial . They undergo two test day interval least 48 hour maximal 14 day , ensure complete physical recovery comparable physical condition two test . It randomize whether participant receives Ventoline placebo first second test day . To ensure similar test performance , participant monitor staff blind regard test . For information regard study population see Chapter `` Study Design '' `` Arms Investigations '' . 4 . Methods The test describe order suppose conduct . Each test perform test day Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby The Department Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery . 4.1 Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Bioimpedance ) The data collect Total Body Water ( TBW ) , Extracellular Fluid ( ECF ) , Intracellular Fluid ( ICF ) , Fat Free Mass ( FFM ) Fat Mass ( FM ) . 4.2 Lung Clearance Index The equipment analyse LCI 2,5 ( LCI define cumulative expired volume ( CEV ) divide functional residual capacity ( FRC ) ) , Scond ( ventilation heterogeneity generate conductive lung zone ) Sacin ( ventilation heterogeneity generate peripheral acinar entrance . 4.3 Plethysmography ( Static lung function ) The equipment determine different lung parameter measure total lung capacity ( TLC , liter ) , residual volume ( RV , liter ) , functional residual capacity ( FRCpleth , ml ) specific airway resistance ( sRAW , kPa/sec ) ( 35 ) . 4.4 Spirometry The test include force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , force vital capacity ( FVC ) , ratio two volume ( FEV1/FVC ) peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) . 4.5 Diffusion capacity test The diffusion capacity test perform equipment plethysmography . The test determine lung carbon monoxide diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) alveolar volume ( VA ) express percentage expect value . 4.6 Impulse oscillometry The equipment able analyse resistance respiratory system 5 Hz ( R5 ) , 20 Hz ( R20 ) difference two measure resistance ( Diff 5-20 ) ( 38,39 ) . 4.7 Holter-Monitorisation ECG activity orthostatic exercise test monitor 2-channel Holter monitor . Participants wear Holter-Monitors 48 hour activation first visit 24 hour activation second visit . This result 3 data-files : With Pathfinder analysis software , ass ECG change heart rate variability ( HRV ) exercise test . Endpoints HRV ( beat-to-beat variation ) mediterranean hour pulse . 4.8 Orthostatic stress test ( active standing ) During test measure blood pressure heart rate automate sphygmomanometer leave forearm . 4.9 Exercise test Exercise capacity test Lode Corival ® ergometer cycle . With Jaeger MaesterScreen CPX software system , monitor pulmonary ventilation gas exchange breath-by-breath measurement . During test session , heart rate , blood pressure electrocardiogram , measure continuously . The Holter-monitor also record exercise test . Each test day last approximately 4-5 hour . 5 . Statistics If suitable , continuous data report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , otherwise display median value 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . Comparison continuous data unpaired Student 's t-tests , non-normal-distributed data , Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test . All correlation check simple regression analysis . Data include participant use statistical analyse . If correlation make data material evident publish material . Data analysis perform Stata/ IC 12.1 Mac ( StataCorp , Texas , United States America ) . 5.1 . Power calculation Our main hypothesis β2-agonists increase peak exercise oxygen uptake level healthy control . Previously , cohort VSD patient exercise test another study term peak oxygen uptake statistically clinically significant difference find compare control ; 38.0 ± 8.2 ml kg-1 min-1 vs. 47.7 ± 6.5 ml kg-1 min-1 9 . If assume true difference approximately 75 % current endpoint , apply statistical power 90 % level significance 95 % , therefore need include 26 participant three group . We aim include 30 participant group total study population 90 participant . Deviations statistic power calculation evident publish material . 6 . Data storage Each participant give identification number use purpose . A list identification cod complete name , address telephone number save securely store Trial Master File ( TMF ) REDCap . Data store 10 year . All digitalise data store two harddrives - one portable external harddrive keep safe behind two locked door department one external server name REDCap continous back-up . Each identification number Case Report Form ( CRF ) also hold printed trial document . Physical document store behind two locked door CRF store TMF .
