	<detailed_description>Therapy Adults affect idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 3 cycle pulse high-dose dexamethasone ( HD-DXM ) : prospective randomize clinical trial Alireza Sadeghi , Saeid Rezaei Jouzdani , Forough Hosseini Introduction : Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) autoimmune disorder characterize platelet destruction lead decreased platelet count increase risk bleeding . Mechanisms include autoantibody- mediated platelet destruction , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte platelet lysis , impaired platelet maturation production identify pathogenesis ITP . ( 1 ) The first line treatment ITP still corticosteroid therapy . Prednisone ( PDN ) standard corticosteroid therapy ITP practical guideline usually give 1 mg/kg per day 4 week taper . ( 2 ) Recent study suggest pulsed high-dose dexamethasone give dose 40 mg/day 4-day course treatment alternative corticosteroid instead prednisone reduce duration adverse effect corticosteroid therapy . ( 3-5 ) A multicenter randomize clinical trial compare 2 corticosteroid therapy suggest HD-DXM effective good tolerance PDN . ( 4 ) Another multicenter cohort study use repeat course HD-DXM ( 6 4 cycle , repeat cycle 28 day 14 day interval ) confirm benefit compare conventional therapy propose first-line treatment patient ITP . Also difference overall response rate third fourth cycle HD-DXM pulse therapy , use 3 therapy cycle 14 day interval cycle , propose well safety efficacy . ( 5 ) In prospective , randomize , control clinical trial investigator ' aim compare efficacy adverse effect 3 therapy cycle HD-DXM versus conventional treatment PDN untreated adult patient ITP . In study standardize criterion definition use accord consensus international work group guideline ITP ( 6 ) compare clinical outcome two corticosteroid treatment regimen determine superior regimen first line strategy new primary ITP adult .</detailed_description>
