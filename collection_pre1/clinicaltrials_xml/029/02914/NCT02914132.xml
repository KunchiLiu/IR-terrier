	<brief_title>Safety Evaluation Seraph® Reduce Bacteremia Patients Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial prospective , non-randomized study patient adjunctive treatment blood stream infection ( BSI ) patient renal replacement therapy The heparin surface study currently market extracorporeal circuit . It show absorb various type Gram positive Gram negative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) reduce toxin cytokine vitro study use whole blood . For study , patient renal replacement therapy develop bacteremia Seraph® Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter include dialysis circuit 4 hour , one day , hourly monitoring . Patients follow 14 day post treatment . Patients monitor vital sign laboratory index day treatment post procedure day 1 , 7 14 .</detailed_description>
