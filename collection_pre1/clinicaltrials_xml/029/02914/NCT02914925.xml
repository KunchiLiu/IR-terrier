	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass use commercially available arm weight support training system ( Armeo®Spring ) conjunction Constraint Induced Therapy ( CIT ) improve upper extremity function child unilateral cerebral palsy . In addition , study aim assess potential cortical change Armeo®Spring therapy CIT use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) motor mapping . This within-subjects repeated-measures study conduct St. Mary 's Hospital Children . Subjects recruit general population . A sample size 10 participant require study . Minority gender distribution study expect reflect distribution general population region . Therapy : Participating child unaffected arm place sling . The sling place start day child encourage therapy sessions.The affect arm use repetitive therapeutic activities.Therapy session include activity aim building motor learn skill . TMS use map brain . Participants MRI brain T1 weight 0.9 -1.1 voxel . size allow on-screen navigation cerebral cortex perform TMS.The stimulate coil hold scalp M1 hemisphere induce electrical current pass coil create magnetic pulse stimulate brain Children assess use functional hand test TMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Combined Armeospring CIT Neuro-motor Functional Recovery Children With Unilateral CP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : This study evaluate effect combine Armeo®spring pediatric Constraint Induced Therapy neuro-motor functional recovery child unilateral cerebral palsy . Background : Children unilateral cerebral palsy ( CP ) tend use impaired arm hand throughout life . This disuse limb postnatal development stunt activity-dependent structural functional development motor system . Enabling young child readily use affected extremity likely increase competitive ability affect side improve functional anatomical integrity motor system . Several study show apply restraint less affected hand intensive repetitive use affect hand significant effect overcome learn non-use . There evidence suggest CIT produce significant cortical reorganization adult chronic sub-acute cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) patient chronic traumatic brain injury lower limb patient CVA . The association motor physiology motor performance child hemiplegic CP examine . Recent study show child whose impaired hand control contralateral connection unaffected motor cortex show great improvement intensive hand training child whose impaired hand control ipsilateral connection affect motor cortex . In order future therapy apply selectively brain region important mediating recovery , important determine location plastic change produce intensive practice . Subject Population : Children CP Hemiplegia Design : Participating child enrol engage intensive CI therapeutic activity along 30-45 minute Armeo®Spring base activity progressively increase level difficult , 6 h/day 5 day week three week . Each child 's performance track activity modify base performance . Hand function would assess use functional hand test ( AHA , Box &amp; Blocks test , Jebsen Taylor hand function test ) TMS three time point : , six month completion training protocol . Outcome measure : Outcome variable TMS measure corticomotor excitability use single-pulse TMS . Motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) record via surface electromyography ( EMG ) . Significance : Understanding rehabilitation modulate brain area associate motor deficit CP .</detailed_description>
