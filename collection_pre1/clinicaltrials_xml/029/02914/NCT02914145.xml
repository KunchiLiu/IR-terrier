	<brief_title>Mass Drug Administrations DHA-PQP Accelerate Towards Malaria Elimination Magude District , Southern Mozambique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim deliver two yearly consecutive round community wide MDA use DHA-PQP ( full treatment , 3 day , supervised DOT day 0 ) month 1 2 , combine parasite prevalence survey use RDTs PCR . The first RDT survey ( conduct entire study population 60,000 inhabitant individual 's dose MDA1 ) would provide precise estimate RDT measurable P. falciparum baseline prevalence . During first round MDA , full blood also collect filter paper individual PCR evaluation investigate PCR-based parasite prevalence community . During second MDA round , blood collect filter paper subsample study population screen PCR-based parasite prevalence community among first-trimester pregnant woman . Effectiveness MDA round measure throughout 12-month period . During first six month , impact measure base RDT positivity PCR positivity measure month 1 ( baseline ; method ) subsequently ( month 2 , PCR ; month 6 , RDT PCR ) ; malaria incidence community measure passive case detection ( PCD ) different health post . The success two round MDA , measure : ) Prevalence malaria infection ( RDT and/or PCR ) subgroup study population month six ; b ) Incidence malaria detect PCD ( month 1 6 ) ; c ) Identification hotspot maintain transmission study area ; ) Coverage achieve MDA1 MDA2 round ) . Should two round achieve predefined success milestone [ 1 . Decrease parasite prevalence 90 % RDT and/or PCR ; 2 ) Coverage 80 % round ; 3 ) Absence clear geographic hotspot 4 ) Incidence clinical malaria community &lt; 1 % i.e &lt; 600 cases/year ] two round MDA ( target focal MDA ) totality part Magude district organize , start month 7 . DHA/PQP chosen drug choice MDA . The pharmacokinetic profile piperaquine - long half-life component drug DHA-PQP - confers minimum 1-month post-treatment prophylaxis effect . If administer monthly ( 3 day time ) 4 week interval , prophylactic effect could protect individual pre-treatment Plasmodium infect mosquito well mosquitoes infected mass treatment residual circulating gametocyte . Mosquitoes live maximum 28 day return feed human . During period population pre-treatment infect mosquito gradually die away , exhaust mosquito reservoir infection .</detailed_description>
