	<brief_title>Personalized Titanium Plates vs CAD/CAM Surgical Splints Maxillary Repositioning Orthognathic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The reposition maxillary segment essential esthetic functional outcome orthognathic surgery . With giant leap three-dimensional ( 3D ) computer-aided surgical simulation ( CASS ) technology development , surgeon able simulate various surgical plan computer achieve best possible outcome . In order transfer virtual surgical plan patient time surgery , surgical splint manufacture computer-aided design manufacturing ( CAD/CAM ) technique traditionally use intraoperative reposition maxilla . Nonetheless , position maxilla still dependent mandibular autorotation . The instability mandibular condyle-fossa relationship potential problem may directly affect placement maxillary segment desire position . Personalized titanium plate manufacture use titanium 3D printing technique use maxilla reposition fixation improve operative accuracy orthognathic surgery . Despite , evidence advantage personalize titanium plate technique strong base study . The purpose study determine whether personalized titanium plate achieve good accuracy CAD/CAM surgical splint maxilla reposition orthognathic surgery . The accuracy use method maxilla reposition quantitatively evaluate use linear angular measurement . Secondary outcome include operative time , amount intraoperative blood loss , preoperative preparation time treatment cost also measure evaluate feasibility clinical application personalize titanium plate technique orthognathic surgery .</detailed_description>
