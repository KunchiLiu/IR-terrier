	<brief_summary>The chroedem study aim assess tissue biomolecular component chronic low limb oedema ( CO ) . The investigator work hypothesis accord aetiology CO , proportion oedema &amp; composition peri-oedema tissue ( fat , muscle , fibrosis/inflammation ) might differ could least part explain difference failure/success compressive therapy one patient another . For purpose , 24 patient post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) -related oedema 24 patient primary lymphedema undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) legs biological ( genetic ) testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic low limb oedema consequence abnormal accumulation fluid interstitium locate beneath skin leg . It frequent disease significant morbidity ( skin infection , leg ulcers… ) , deeply alter patient 's quality life . On pathological point view , current main hypothesis hemodynamic ( i.e . failure venous lymphatic return ) . Recent data suggest factor , particularly genetic one ( gene cod protein inflammation fibrosis , adipogenesis lymphangiogenesis… ) could influence development CO. Stimulation mediator vary one person another one clinical set another ( i.e . venous insufficiency vs. lymphedema etc… ) . One therefore assume CO homogeneous entity distribution tissue component varies . On therapeutic point view , difference distribution tissue component could least part explain difference effectiveness compression therapy tissue dysmorphia one person another one type CO another . The study primary objective ass compare MRI different tissue component ( oedema , fat , muscle , inflammation/fibrosis ) low limb CO venous vs. lymphatic origin . The investigator shall conduct prospective observational pilot study . 24 patient CO PTS origin 24 patient CO lymphatic origin ( primary lymphoedema ) undergo clinical examination , 3-D laser scanner volumetry lower limb , blood test MRI low limb . Main exclusion criterion obesity bilateral CO . The main primary outcome measure proportion fat , muscle oedema assess MRI pre-determined low limb area . The main secondary outcome measure prevalence group ) variation exonic sequence gene cod protein inflammation/fibrosis , angiogenesis , adipogenesis ; ii ) variation exonic sequence gene report literature associate primary lymphoedema . This study allow good characterize tissue structure inflammatory , adipous angio-genetic profile low limb CO . The potential therapeutic perspective adapt compressive therapy type oedema test impact new therapy ( e.g . anti-inflammatory drug oedema important fibrotic component ? ) .</detailed_description>
