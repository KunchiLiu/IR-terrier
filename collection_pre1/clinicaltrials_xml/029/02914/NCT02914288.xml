	<brief_summary>Intracranial artery disease detect development HR-MR. HR-MR depict vascular wall directly give u information beyond pre-existing imaging modality digital subtraction angiography , magnetic resonance angiography , compute tomography angiography . Hence , HR-MR consider become promising imaging modality intracranial artery disease many study publish recently . However , enough differentiate various intracranial artery disease atherosclerosis , dissection , moyamoya disease , vasculitis , reversible vasoconstriction syndrome . In real clinical arena , intracranial artery disease difficult diagnose distinguish among disease . Of disease , usefulness HR-MR consistently publish detection diagnosis intracranial artery dissection recently . HR-MR seem important reliable image method intracranial artery dissection . Therefore , intracranial artery dissection necessary study use HR-MR. Intracranial artery dissection dynamic vascular pathology . The geometric change common among intracranial artery disease . However , report geometric change HR-MR . The investigator acquire retrospective data natural course intracranial artery dissection HR-MR preparing publishing article . However , data prospective intraindividual comparison . Therefore , reliability enough convince natural course . If investigator get prospective intraindividual data , definite natural course intracranial artery dissection could acquire would helpful diagnose dissection differentiate vascular pathology . The prospective longitudinal information study could guide u important map confuse HR-MR finding . The protocol image follow : initial ( optional ) , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month ( optional ) , 12 month .</brief_summary>
