	<brief_summary>Approx . 65 % resuscitated patient intensive care unit internal medicine due myocardial infarction . Almost patient initially diagnose treated cath lab . Therapy usually consist one stent implantation . After implantation coronary stent , dual platelet inhibition necessary 12 month . Insufficient platelet inhibition cause pronounced increase risk stent thrombosis . Therefore , knowledge individual platelet function valuable . Several factor potentially promote delay reduced mode action platelet function inhibitor resuscitate patient : 1. oral administration impossible medication need administer via gastric line . 2. gastric absorption delay resuscitation 3. accord current guideline patient treat therapeutic hypothermia . Including time rewarming cool period ~48h</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Function Resuscitated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients successful resuscitation associate myocardial infarction include study morning index event . Patients get dual platelet inhibition discretion interventionist . Patients treat therapeutic hypothermia accord local Standard operating procedure 24h rewarming perform within additional 20h . Platelet function measure every morning Aspirin mediate well P2Y12 ( purinergic G protein-coupled receptors-12 ) -inhibition mediate platelet function inhibition record . All relevant clinical data include APACHE ( Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation ) SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ) score collect . The degree platelet inhibition time ( 7 day ) difference three drug test evaluate optical aggregometry use commercial VerifyNow test system .</detailed_description>
