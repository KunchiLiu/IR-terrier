	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma , common extra-cranial solid tumour child , remain one major challenge paediatric oncology . A promising way improve outcome disease appear development adjuvant therapeutic strategy . In research anti-GD2 antibody , standard treatment , combine 131-l Metaiodobenzylguanidine ( mlBG ) anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 ( anti-PD1 ) antibody Nivolumab - investigate drug - aim generate sustain anti-neuroblastoma immunity . In particular determine safety tolerability novel combination well document evidence efficacy paediatric patient relapse refractory high risk neuroblastoma . This study sponsor University Hospital Southampton take place 4 hospital United Kingdom , Germany USA . The estimate duration study 2 year , start December 2016 . This `` adaptive study '' . Such design use accumulate data ongoing trial modify aspect study ( e.g . duration , number treatment ) without undermine validity integrity . There 3 cohort patient . As safety Nivolumab well establish , Cohort 1 ass safety tolerability combination 131-l mlBG . Cohort 2 add anti-GD2 drug combination , assess safety tolerability . Cohort 3 escalate 3 agent full 100 % dose level assure safety expand analysis clinical laboratory data dose level . Patients initially recruit Cohort 1 . Patients must complete least 12 week trial treatment without reach Dose Limiting Toxicity patient recruit next cohort . A minimum 3 evaluable patient treat cohort 1-3 . Assuming full dose combination therapy ( cohort ) tolerable , 15 evaluable patient treat .</brief_summary>
