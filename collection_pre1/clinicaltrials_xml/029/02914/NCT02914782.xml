	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient need intravenous fluid therapy order correct prevent problem fluid and/or electrolyte status renal protection . The decision optimal composition amount IV-fluids difficult complex . It well known error fluid- electrolyte management contribute overall morbidity mortality . Due administration large volume normal saline and/or decrease urinary output sodium chloride iatrogen electrolyte disorder , hyperchloremic acidosis dysnatremia common abnormality clinical practice . The common fact normal saline non-physiological level chloride sodium , intensifies problem high volume administration . ( Burdett et al . 2003 ; Adrogué &amp; Madias 1997 ) . Hypernatremia independent risk factor mortality critically ill patient increase length ICU stay ( Lindner et al . 2010 ; Stieglmair et al . 2013 ) Hypernatremia associate impaired renal fluid regulation , well lack thirst mechanism . In ICU fact require exact measurement fluid- electrolyte intake ( non- ) renal loss . ( Lindner et al . 2009 ) . Therefore , critical care setting measure fluid balance ( difference infusion input renal / non-renal loss ) daily routine . The renal output measure frequently nursing staff . An automated acquisition urinary output combine data infusion site would reduce workload staff would allow visualization fluid status . Furthermore , beyond volume , concentration composition fluid important parameter . The comparison urinary electrolyte electrolyte input infusion allow early detection electrolyte disorder ( Besen et al . 2015 ) . Sodium chloride main ion solution infuse critically ill patient . The excessive infusion fluid lead sodium chloride overloads associate high mortality ( Noritomi et al . 2009 ) . For decade , urinary sodium use diagnose renal disease . Nevertheless , renal excretion sodium largely impaired critically ill patient , particularly patient acute kidney injury . Due high frequent measurement renal output , would possible also measure urinary electrolyte relative change likely relevant absolute electrolyte concentration . Urinary electrolyte measurement may alert presence AKI development occur increase creatinine oliguria ( Maciel 2013 ; Maciel et al . 2015 ; Molitoris 2013 ) . The rationale investigation therefore collect data relate fluid- electrolyte management critically ill patient order find patterns fluid- electrolyte imbalance may lead disturbance , may allow early detection acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Patients undergo scheduled cardiac surgery include trial . The rationale behind one hand , patient cohort homogenous hand , risk develop AKI 30-40 % among cardiac surgery patient ( Rosner et al . 2006 ) . The aim detect characteristic pattern electrolyte metabolism patient develop AKI .</detailed_description>
