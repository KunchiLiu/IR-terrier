	<brief_summary>MRI-guided high intensity focus ultrasound ( MRI-HIFU ) proven safe effective method treat uterine fibroid also adenomyosis . However , systematic study effect treatment factor affect fertility still lack . Also quite little known body 's systemic response MRI-HIFU . Thus aim study obtain information systemic response body HIFU-treatment treat non-malignant disease well study effect MRI-HIFU factor affect fertility . Women symptomatic uterine fibroid adenomyosis wish pregnancy select study treat use MRI-HIFU . The severity symptom assess UFS-QoL questionnaire also use follow-up 3 , 6 12 month treatment . Blood , urine endometrium sample collect pre- postoperatively follow-up 3 , 6 12 month treatment . From sample detail analysis immunological , inflammatory hormonal response perform . As first study Finland treat uterine fibroid adenomyosis use MRI-HIFU , also report efficacy MRI-HIFU treat uterine disorder publish , key tool assess treatment outcome would UFS-QoL questionnaire .</brief_summary>
