	<brief_summary>A large proportion men prostate cancer overdiagnosed overtreated mainly due PSA testing . Active surveillance ( AS ) aim reduce harm recommend curative treatment sign tumor progression occur . There however number uncertainty AS , important initiate treatment . The investigator therefore start large randomize multicenter trial test standardize active surveillance protocol specify trigger repeat biopsy initiation curative treatment . The standardized protocol compare current practice active surveillance . The primary aim study reduce overtreatment subsequent side effect , without increase risk disease progression prostate cancer mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY HYPOTHESIS The study hypothesis standardize trigger initiation curative treatment men active surveillance reduce over-treatment without increase disease progression prostate cancer mortality . STUDY DESIGN Randomized multi-centre open-label clinical trial INTERVENTIONS Computerized randomisation ( 1:1 ) within 12 month diagnosis prostate cancer , either active surveillance accord current practice trial centre ( reference arm ) , standardise active surveillance protocol apply specific criterion repeat biopsy initiation curative treatment ( experimental arm ) . Patients stratify centre Gleason score . Follow-up group : PSA every 6 month , clinical examination ( PSA test ) annually , multiparametric MRI every second year . Repeat biopsy ( reference arm ) : Current practice Repeat biopsy ( experimental arm ) , standardise trigger : 1 . A systematic repeat biopsy PSA density increase &gt; 0.2 ng/ml/cc 2 . MRI progression men previously Gleason grade 3+3 : 5 mm increase size dimension measurable lesion , increase PI-RADS score 3-5 , new lesion PI-RADS score 3-5 3 . MRI progression men Gleason grade 3+4 : 5 mm increase size dimension measurable lesion , new lesion PI-RADS score 3-5 Curative treatment ( reference arm ) : Current practice Curative treatment ( experimental arm ) , standardise trigger : 1 . MRI progression lesion confirm Gleason grade 4 : increase PI-RADS score 4 5 2 . Pathological progression : Gleason pattern 5 , primary Gleason pattern 4 core 5 mm cancer , Gleason 3+4 3 core 30 % 10 core take , Gleason 3+4 10 mm cancer Patients follow continuously initiation treatment , event metastasis , break point active surveillance consider terminate watchful wait start , death cause . After initiation curative treatment , watchful waiting , palliative treatment cancer progression , patient follow accord standard protocol participate centre .</detailed_description>
