	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory condition cause continuous mucosal inflammation colon , accompany episode bloody diarrhoea abdominal pain . Both infliximab adalimumab use success moderate-to-severe UC refractory conventional therapy . More recently , golimumab , another anti-TNF antibody , add treatment armamentarium . In multi-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled PURSUIT trial , patient moderate-to-severe UC randomize induction therapy golimumab ( 200-100 mg , 100-50 mg week 0 2 ) achieve clinical response , clinical remission mucosal heal frequent patient randomize placebo . In PURSUIT maintenance trial , patient randomize golimumab every four week ( 100 50 mg ) maintain clinical response week 54 significantly often patient randomize placebo . Data use golimumab daily clinical practice unavailable . The aim retrospective Belgian multi-centre BE-SMART trial evaluate mid-term outcome golimumab patient moderate-to-severe colitis . The primary endpoint steroid-free golimumab continuation week 26 . Secondary endpoint include ( steroid-free ) clinical remission , ( steroid-free ) clinical response , ( steroid-free ) mucosal healing , ( steroid-free ) complete mucosal heal hospitalization-free survival , colectomy-free survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory condition cause continuous mucosal inflammation colon , affect rectum variable extent colon continuity.1 Ulcerative colitis characterise relapse remit course . The aetiology still unknown , genetic environmental factor seem crucial . Ulcerative colitis primarily present late adolescence early adulthood , although diagnosis may make age . Compared general population , quality life patient UC experience low across dimension health.2 ; 3 When decide appropriate treatment strategy active ulcerative colitis one consider activity , distribution pattern disease.4 Golimumab recently indicate treatment moderately severely active UC adult patient inadequate response conventional therapy include corticosteroid 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) azathioprine ( AZA ) , intolerant medical contraindication therapies.5 ; 6 Besides golimumab , also infliximab adalimumab indicate reimbursed treatment adult UC.7-9 In multi-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled PURSUIT trial , patient establish diagnosis UC moderate-to-severe disease activity randomize receive golimumab 200 mg follow 100 mg , 400 mg follow 200 mg , twice placebo 2 week apart.5 At week 6 , significantly great proportion patient golimumab 200/100 mg golimumab 400/200 mg group ( 51.8 % , 55.0 % , respectively ) clinical response patient assign placebo ( 29.7 % ; P &lt; 0.0001 comparison ) . The efficacy golimumab induction regimen also demonstrate major secondary endpoint clinical remission , mucosal healing , improvement baseline IBDQ score , week 6 . In term safety , similar proportion patient report adverse event week 6 across group ( 37.5 % , 200/100 mg ; 38.9 % , 400/200 mg ; 38.2 % , placebo ) . In study extension PURSUIT , patient respond induction therapy golimumab ( n=464 ) randomly assign group give placebo injection 50 100 mg golimumab every 4 week week 52.6 Patients respond placebo induction study continue receive placebo , non-responders induction study receive 100 mg golimumab . The primary endpoint , clinical response maintain week 54 , observe 47.1 % patient receive 50 mg golimumab , 50.6 % receive 100 mg golimumab , 31.4 % receive placebo ( P=0.010 P &lt; 0.001 , respectively ) . At week 30 54 , high percentage patient receive 100 mg golimumab clinical remission mucosal healing ( 28.6 % 43.5 % ) patient give placebo ( 15.4 % 26.9 % ; P=0.003 P=0.001 , respectively ) 50 mg golimumab ( 23.5 % 41.8 % , respectively ) . Data daily clinical practice currently unavailable . Of note , infliximab require intravenous route , therefore administer hospital . Altogether , transport monitoring phase , administration last half day . In addition , logistically challenge patient reach hospital ( long distance , difficult public transport , significantly alter health condition , … ) . Subcutaneous therapy administer home therefore convenient alternative absenteeism patient active life ( worker , student ) well patient challenge reach hospital . In recent prospective survey Switzerland , majority anti-TNF naïve patient Crohn 's disease prefer subcutaneous administration either adalimumab ( 36 % ) certolizumab pegol ( 28 % ) compare intravenous infliximab ( 25 % ) .10 The patient ' decision select specific anti-TNF drug influence ease use ( 69 % ) , time require therapy ( 34 % ) , time interval application drug ( 31 % ) , scientific evidence efficacy ( 19 % ) , fear syrinx ( 10 % ) . Golimumab therefore relevant alternative infliximab adalimumab , improve patient ' adherence thanks lack either interference everyday life hurdle reach hospital , need one injection every four week . Golimumab currently exist prefilled syringe auto-injector device ( Smartject™ ) . In recent open-label , multi-centric , prospective GO-MORE study patient active rheumatoid arthritis , patient inject 50 mg subcutaneous golimumab monthly 6 month . Patients report use preference auto-injector evaluation questionnaire . Patient auto-injector rating favourable overall ( e.g . ease use , pain ) .11 A similar Belgian trial conduct patient initiate golimumab moderate-to-severe UC ( SMART , ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02155335 ) . In trial , 100 patient moderate-to-severe UC , either anti-TNF naïve previously fail infliximab therapy , previously perform self-injection indication , randomize ( 1:1 ) start crossover therapy two injection 50 mg golimumab supply prefilled syringe , two injection 50 mg golimumab supply auto-injector device . The efficacy golimumab therapy evaluate SMART study , patient population ideal cohort evaluate short- mid-term outcome golimumab monotherapy real life , compare data PURSUIT clinical trial data .</detailed_description>
