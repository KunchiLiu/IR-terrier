	<brief_summary>This study primarily aim investigate arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) , underlie mechanism patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) , remain date understudied . Although , study reveal AMI need eliminate improvement muscle strength achieve , date quadriceps muscle inhibition patient PFP remain understudied . To date influence AMI functional performance direct link pain patient PFP remain unclear . This study aim investigate link AMI pain , functional performance acute treatment affect functional performance pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Patellofemoral Pain Functional Performance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) one frequently diagnosed condition patient knee complaint . Studies investigate therapeutic effect PFP reveal majority patient PFP still suffer knee pain 5 8 year , despite initially receive treatment education , indicate current treatment fail prevent chronicity symptom . Considering current treatment-strategies patient PFP seem unable avoid development chronic symptom , question arises underlie factor PFP understand sufficiently . In contrary current broad body literature weakness , potentially underlying factor might influence even lead PFP , arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) break phenomenon remain understudied . Pain PFP proven link quadriceps strength deficit , gluteal strength deficit , knee stability , irregularity quadriceps torque curve , functional performance . Bazett et al . ( 2011 ) describe pain `` symptom might play role etiology progression PFP '' . Furthermore , pain seem play crucial role AMI . However , correlation pain AMI patient PFP investigate currently . No assessment isolation provide full picture problem . The combination AMI , break phenomenon biomechanical analysis might enable determination impact inhibition strength biomechanical change . In addition , might provide answer whether AMI weakness cause biomechanical alteration , would help optimise treatment approach PFP . The PowersTM strap strap develop aim assist low limb kinematics , decrease knee varus support femoral abduction external rotation . This treatment may potentially also directly improve functional performance . As functional performance participant PFP application PowersTM strap investigate , study aim analyse direct link application PowersTM strap functional performance pain .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria patient PFP : 1 .
