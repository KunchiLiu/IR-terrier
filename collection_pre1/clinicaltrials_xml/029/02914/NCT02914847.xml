	<detailed_description>The problem self-harm need short intervention young people . Self-harm , `` act self-poisoning self-injury , irrespective apparent purpose act '' behaviour use cope intense emotion psychological distress . It occur variety mental health diagnosis well individual diagnosis . Of concern almost one five young adult report self-harm behaviour . A United Kingdom ( UK ) survey school describe 13 % 15-16 year old self-harmed life 8 % last year . Factors associate self-harm include disadvantage socio-economic background , social isolation lack support , negative life event include childhood emotional , physical sexual abuse . Although self-harm different suicidality , people self-harm carry fourfold risk suicidal thought behaviour within one year , risk risk confer mental health problem psychosocial risk factor . Self-harm substantial personal impact cost National Health Service ( NHS ) . In Cambridgeshire , number hospital admission self-harm high UK average , make address self-harm significant issue local primary secondary health care National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guideline recommend offer `` psychological intervention specifically structured people self-harm , aim reduce self-harm . In addition : ( ) intervention tailor individual need , could include cognitive-behavioural , psychodynamic problem-solving elements余 ( ii ) therapist train supervised therapy offering people self-harm余 ( iii ) therapists also able work collaboratively person identify problem cause distress lead self-harm . '' A number intervention develop show efficacy reduce self-harm adolescent adult . However therapy vary 4 session much long duration , currently mostly available individual mental health care variable period wait time . Moreover , almost half young people refer recommended treatment attend follow-up session . There lack short intervention self-harm specifically targeted young people . Short intervention engage young people urgently need allow young people well manage reduce self-harm also outside secondary mental health care , alongside / wait longterm problem address ( psychiatric disorder , housing employment difficulty etc. ) . Developing new treatment self-harm use imagery-based intervention . Mental imagery process 'seeing mind 's eye ' . Intrusive mental image carry intense negative emotion central several mental disorder . For example , individual social anxiety experience intrusive image sweat blush intensely try speak someone , image fuel anxiety judge others possibly stop attend social situation . Mental imagery associate self-harm also appear common phenomenon individual describe image associate self-harm carry many different emotional meaning ( e.g . evoke sense relief , increase urge self-harm ) , line drive self-harm every individual . The characteristic mental image relate intensity emotion applies positive emotion . For example , vivid positive imagery relate great excitement positive mood . Overall , suggest mental imagery common phenomenon , many individual likely experience context high emotion , mental image could use generate helpful emotion . In fact , address distress mental image promote positive imagery use trauma , depression self-harm personality disorder . The investigator successfully treat case self-harm behaviour use short course imagery-focused therapy Bipolar Disorder . Moreover , mental image promote behaviour . Imagining something make likely act , simulate actual event mind allow individual `` pre-experience '' aspect event . Hence , via imagine future scenario individual may feel ready engage action successfully . For example , sport add mental imagery training ( visualise exercise ) physical practice exercise improve performance . Moreover , imagine action also involve anticipate emotionally reward likely . This may enhance motivation act . The vivid real-like mental image completing desire action , strong positive emotion motivation actually . This type imagery healthy behaviour desire action develop therapy call Functional Imagery Training ( FIT ) . FIT encourage individual imagine benefit work towards goal , especially benefit expect happen right away ( e.g . feel good oneself ) . So far , FIT show successful approach intervention reduce snack addictive behaviour . Based , investigator propose FIT train individual imagine helpful behaviour rather self-harm distressed . FIT train vivid real-like imagery alternative goal self-harm , likely produce reward positive emotion . Our FIT protocol aim support individual self-harm : ( ) identify helpful behaviour alternative goal feel like self-harming ( e.g . go run , listen music ) 余 ( ii ) practise mental imagery alternative behaviour , boost desire achieve goal余 ( iii ) succeed engage alternative behaviour self-harm . Importantly , FIT consist two face-to-face session plus five brief telephone support session . Therefore potential offering immediate support young people either exclude wait complex intervention . The challenge engage young people . Imagery-based intervention focus visual technique easily amenable support smartphone app . Smartphone usage young people high . Therefore , enhance psychological intervention via smartphone app could successful strategy ensure young people keep practise therapy technique engage learned therapy session without need face face follow-up . The support smartphone app follow FIT session aid overcome barrier engagement report young people . Therefore , Imaginator study tailor FIT young people add smartphone app support , make intervention interest approachable age group . The investigator develop bespoke app call Imaginator . This app create collectively via six meeting Young People Advisory Group ( YPAG : 4 member , 1 male , age 19 22 year old , live experience self-harm ) , together research team John Harper , App Shine Development company . In summary , self-harm behaviour highly prevalent problem among young people UK ( worldwide ) , particular urgency Cambridgeshire . It represent major social healthcare problem community . Currently , lack short easily accessible intervention specifically help young people reduce self-harming behaviour . As mental imagery-based technique use reduce unwanted emotion support motivation helpful behaviour , The investigator propose Functional Imagery Training ( FIT ) could represent successful strategy reduce self-harm behaviour . FIT intend brief focus intervention young people age 16-25 ( regardless diagnosis ) add pharmacological psychological therapy . To improve access engagement intervention young people , investigator deliver FIT support smartphone app develop together Young People Advisory Group .</detailed_description>
