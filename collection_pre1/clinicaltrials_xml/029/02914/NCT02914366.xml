	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence dementia serious threat medical system society . About 500,000 Canadians affect dementia , number rise 1 million next 20 year . Dementia already cost Canadian economy 15 billion dollar per year . While much focus dementia Alzheimer 's disease , autopsy study suggest 30 % dementia due disease cause abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulation ( Synucleinopathies ) Parkinson 's Disease Dementia ( PDD ) . Patients Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) typically present motor symptom , disease also characterize insidious cognitive decline , increase relation disease duration . Glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) degradative enzyme resides subcellular compartment call lysosome , cleave neutral glycolipid , glucocerebroside , present plasma membrane cell . GCase intimately link Parkinson 's disease . Being `` asymptomatic carrier '' GCase mutation currently high genetic risk factor PD , study suggest 1/3 patient carry mutation . Reductions GCase activity likely also play role sporadic PD , patient low level GCase brain cerebrospinal fluid , even carry mutant GCase allele . Reducing GCase genetically pharmacologically animal study result cognitive impairment . The aggregate cause impairment clear re-introduction normal GCase back brain . In addition , overexpressing GCase brain Parkinson 's disease mouse model improve cognition . GCase therefore appear excellent target therapy address underlie pathophysiology PDD improve stop disease progression . Ambroxol expectorant available counter 50 country 30 year . Recently , Mahuran Lab identify Ambroxol screen library compound agent stabilizes wild-type ( normal ) GCase . By stabilize GCase , Ambroxol able markedly increase GCase protein activity normal Gaucher disease fibroblasts dose 10 micromolar . Ambroxol also increase GCase normal mouse neuronal culture 150 % normal dose 30 micromolar . Ambroxol good lipophilicity ( cLogP = 2.8 ) low polar surface area ( PSA 58 Ã…2 ) , predict good CNS penetration . Unpublished study perform ExSAR corporation demonstrate single multiple dose experiment rat , Ambroxol cross rapidly brain exhibit brain plasma concentration ratio great 10 indicate outstanding CNS penetration . Ambroxol excellent safety record , study &gt; 15,000 patient 100 trial . Ambroxol sell counter much world expectorant dose 75-120 mg/day . Furthermore , Ambroxol consider safe approve intravenous use pregnant woman dose 1000 mg/day IV ( 15 mg/kg ) improve fetal lung maturation preterm delivery . Clinical trial 390 pregnant woman perform use dos 3000 mg one day 1300 mg/day 33 day . Critically ill neonate also give dos high 30 mg/kg respiratory distress . The fact Ambroxol use high dos pregnant woman neonates suggests dos safe . In pilot study , Ambroxol effective improve GCase function human . In trial aim non-neurological Gaucher disease , 12 patient receive 150 mg/day 6 month , one measureable improvement . The best response light patient ( receive 3 mg/kg/day ) , suggest Ambroxol dose . Ambroxol also administer three Japanese Gaucher disease patient severe neurological disease , 1000-3000 mg/day 12-31 month . These patient improvement seizure frequency neurological symptom ; one patient regain ability sit unsupported walk . Ambroxol never examine PD Lewy Body Dementia patient ; however , trial pharmacological chaperone therapy suggest recent review journal `` The Proceedings National Academy Sciences . '' A successful outcome trial greatly accelerate development therapeutic neurodegenerative disease . This proposal outline completely novel pharmacological target PDD , namely enzyme GCase . It also propose completely novel therapy use drug Ambroxol , agent consider safe enough give pregnant woman , improved GCase function pilot study human . This strategy could stop reverse underlie pathology Parkinson 's disease ; might allow patient get well . Furthermore , re-purposing exist medication excellent safety record greatly shorten time bring therapy general use , allow u leapfrog normally decades-long drug development process . This study test hypothesis Ambroxol improve course cognitive impairment motor function PDD raise GCase level blood CSF . The study specific aim 1 ) demonstrate efficacy Ambroxol improving , slow progression cognitive deficit , motor symptom , CSF/neuroimaging biomarkers , 2 ) acquire additional pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data use future trial 3 ) demonstrate safety tolerability Ambroxol patient PDD . This study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial Ambroxol 1050 mg/day 525 mg/day subject mild moderate PDD . Subjects allow require receive concomitant treatment stable regimen Parkinson 's disease dementia . Eligibility enrollment assess initially one Screening visit , occur within 28 day Baseline . Eligible subject randomly assign ( 1:1:1 ) Baseline visit one follow three treatment group : Ambroxol 1050 mg/day group , Ambroxol 525 mg/day group placebo group . Patients randomize receive placebo one two dos Ambroxol . Participants randomized 1050 mg/day group begin dose 225mg ( 3 mg/kg/day ) , increase bi-weekly ~3mg/kg dose 1050 mg/day ( ~l5 mg/kg/day ) . Participants randomize 525 mg/day group begin dose 150 mg/day increase biweekly ~1.5mg/kg dose 525 mg/day . After 52 week , patient offer Ambroxol ( still blind dose ) either 525 1050 mg/day follow 76 week . For minor AE 's ( e.g . GI upset ) , patient allow spread medication dose longer interval , reduce dose high dose tolerate . The dose advance 2 week . For significant non-threatening laboratory abnormality , dos reduce high dose tolerate . Patients allow stop take medication concern drug reaction clinically significant alteration laboratory value . They re-challenged 2-4 week abnormalities resolve . If one experience severe allergic reaction possibly relate study medication , participant discontinue trial . The dose-plasma level plasma concentration-response relationship assess measure plasma Ambroxol level lymphocyte GCase baseline 2 week dose escalation . At 12 week , blood CSF Ambroxol GCase activity quantitated . Patients follow week screen , baseline , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 26 , 34 , 42 52 blood work , ECG , interview . Physical exam occur visit except week 2 8 . Neurological examination occur baseline , week 6 , 12 , 18 , 34 , 42 52 . Neuropsychological exam movement test take place baseline , week 26 week 52 . An MRI perform screen week 52 . CSF collect baseline , week 12 week 52 . Patients undergo clinical neuropsychological assessment baseline , week 26 , week 52 . At assessment administer standard test cognition Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) , ADCS-Clinician 's Global Impression Change ( CGIC ) , Parkinson Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale ( PD-CRS ) , Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( CDR ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , Trail Making Test ( TRAILS ) , Stroop , Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) , Neuropsychological Inventory ( NPI ) ; test motor function/Parkinsonism motor subscale UPDRS Quantitative Movement Testing , include Purdue Pegboard , Timed Go , gait kinematics . MRI perform screen week 52 . Mini-Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) perform visit except week 2 8 . A lumbar puncture perform Baseline , week 12 week 52 . The Primary Outcome measure : ADAS-cog CGIC . These standard cognitive clinical measure use almost cognitive clinical trial . Secondary/ Exploratory outcome measure include 1 . Standard test cognition MMSE , MoCA , CDR , , TRAILS , NPI , PD-CRS 2 . Tests motor function/Parkinsonism : Motor subscale UPDRS , Purdue Pegboard , Timed Up Go , Quantitative Movement Testing 3 .
