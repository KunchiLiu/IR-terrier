	<brief_summary>The objective study determine safety feasibility autologous mononuclear cell ( MNS ) collect bone marrow ( BM ) use add-on intramyocardial delivery individual Ebstein anomaly undergo surgical intervention compare control group undergo surgical procedure without cell delivery . This add-on procedure potential foster new strategy individual congenital heart disease.This open-label study autologous MNC derive bone marrow 2-year follow-up document 1 ) incidence severity adverse event 2 ) monitor change cardiac structure function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells Treatment Ebstein Anomaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open label Phase I trial determine safety feasibility bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell right ventricle subject Ebstein anomaly time plan surgical Ebstein repair compare control group undergo plan surgical intervention without cell delivery add-on procedure . Subjects screen outpatient clinic visit Mayo Clinic interest qualified subject consent offered participation trial . Subject/Family decide participate cell delivery control arm . Once informed consent obtain , subject undergo identical evaluation ( Hematology consultation BM harvest occur cell-treatment group ) , preoperative value established/confirmed selection committee review subject within three day prior plan procedure confirm inclusion exclusion criterion . This require non-study cardiologist review clinical case confirm baseline cardiac function evidence right ventricle dysfunction . However , individual high-risk , primarily neonates preoperative advanced right heart failure NOT include risk add-on procedure may acceptable . Following surgical Ebstein repair control group follow cell-based product delivery treatment group , subject follow 24-months accord pre-determined schedule include imaging study along questionnaire , electrophysiology laboratory study 1 , 6 , 24 month post procedure . All subject contact surveillance phone 3 , 12 , 18 month post procedure .</detailed_description>
