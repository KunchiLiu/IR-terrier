	<brief_summary>The investigator focus two cohort brain tumor patient age , 4-18 year , answer two critical question : 1 ) Can investigators acquire high quality data relevant cognitive function peri-diagnostic period , 2 ) investigator develop predictive model cognitive outcome use serial examination functional imaging cognitive function . Any patient newly diagnose brain tumor age 4-18 eligible enrollment cohort 1 . Only patient previously diagnose tumor posterior fossa eligible cohort 2 . The rationale focus patient first , posterior fossa common location pediatric brain tumor therefore focus impact large segment patient population . Second , three tumor commonly occur , medulloblastoma , ependymoma pilocytic astrocytoma . These treat surgery , radiation chemotherapy ( medulloblastoma ) , surgery radiation therapy ( ependymoma ) surgery ( pilocytic astrocytoma ) . Thus , focus provide platform analyze impact different tumor type different standard treatment cognitive dysfunction . Finally , fact subject tumor brain region control effect tumor location cognitive testing rsfcMRI . Here , repeat evaluation therapy provide necessary data point establish trajectory cognitive development recovery population .</brief_summary>
