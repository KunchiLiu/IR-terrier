Hsp90 inhibitor may overcome ibrutinib resistance Mantle cell lymphoma study investigate whether addition SNX-5422 establish dose ibrutinib result removal mutate BTK blood mononuclear cell and/or prevents delay disease progression subject CLL</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Activity SNX-5422 Plus Ibrutinib CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) prevalent leukemia adult consider curable outside allogeneic stem cell transplantation . BTK critical kinase B cell receptor signal pathway . This pathway amplify CLL result amplification proliferation anti-apoptotic signal . By inhibit BTK , ibrutinib eliminates activation pro-survival pathway microenvironment survival signal . While response ibrutinib high therapy well-tolerated overall , patient relapse others take therapy toxicity reason . Relapse CLL mediate least two separate mechanism . One mutation BTK , decrease ibrutinib 's affinity BTK , also change bind irreversible reversible . This proof concept study investigate whether addition SNX-5422 establish dose ibrutinib reduce mutate BTK CLL cell and/or prevents delay disease progression subject CLL . This open-label study SNX‑5422 combine ibrutinib . In 28 day cycle , SNX‑5422 dose morning every day 21 day , follow 7‑day drug‑free period . Subjects continue receive daily oral ibrutinib establish dose level afternoon every day 28 day . cycle</detailed_description>
