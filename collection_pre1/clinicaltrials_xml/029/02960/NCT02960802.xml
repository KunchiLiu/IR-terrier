	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular morbidity kidney impairment Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high risk cardiovascular event already substantial early stage CKD . The pathophysiology cardiovascular disease CKD patient poorly understood . In end stage renal disease sudden arrhythmic cardiac death rather myocardial infarction due atherosclerosis predominant cause cardiovascular mortality . In uremia endothelial vasodilation impair . This may one explanation high prevalence cardiovascular disease CKD.The renal transplantation reduces cardiovascular risk improve patient survival . The traditional approach cardiac risk assessment like SPECT-MPI ( single photon emission compute tomography-myocardial perfusion image ) perhaps liable chronic kidney disease patient healthy population . Coronary angiography invasive may induce contrast nephropathy deteriorate kidney function . The coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) myocardial flow reserve ( MFR ) magnitude increase coronary flow calculate assess myocardial blood flow rest ( basal flow ) pharmacological vasodilation hyperemia.Myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) need dynamically adapt metabolic demand myocardium control coronary microvascular resistance . Microvascular dysfunction may cause different mechanism , one microvascular dysfunction . CFR measure transthoracic echocardiography ( TTEC ) well intracoronary Doppler echocardiography use estimate CFR . However , blood velocity measurement one coronary artery quantification myocardial blood flow.Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use quantify myocardial blood flow well safe renal impairment contrast agent gadolinium . In recent year PET show modality choice measure myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) . It noninvasive safe renal impairment . High prevalence cardiovascular morbidity CKD-patients explain large vessel atherosclerosis . It show poor cardiac outcome CKD-patients without obstructive coronary artery disease . The dysfunction microvasculature may one explanation circumstance . Despite evidence increase prevalence coronary artery disease CKD patient quite study coronary flow reserve subgroup patient , especially positron emission tomography ( PET ) studies.The result study controversial . As kidney transplantation decrease uremic effect cardiovascular system likely also impact CFR . Endothelial function seem improve renal transplantation.There four study kidney transplant patient coronary flow reserve . None do PET modality choice estimate myocardial blood flow . The total number patient study 107 . In study CFR reduce renal transplant patient compare normal much ESRD patient dialysis . Renal blood flow Renal blood flow ( RBF ) RBF combination blood flow renal artery small vessel way coronary blood flow combination blood flow coronary artery microvasculature myocardium . It probable renal perfusion flow reserve dependent endothelial function way myocardial perfusion . Clinical disorder , renovascular hypertension kidney impairment , show reduce RBF . The ability measure accurately renal blood flow may help u understand renal disease mechanism possibly even focus right therapy right time . In clinical practice , RBF measure indirectly para-aminohippuric acid ( PAH ) clearance . It use renal impairment decrease tubular excretion . Furthermore , give two-kidney value . Renograms give quantitative measurement either interpretable chronic kidney disease . Computed tomography use renal impairment nephrotoxicity contrast agent . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) MRI gadolinium base contrast agent contraindicate especially CKD patient GFR &lt; 30 ml/min risk nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) . However , new functional MRI method without need contrast agent introduce past decade . None show real kidney perfusion . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET provide method estimate quantitative regional renal cortical blood flow noninvasively . Nitzsche et al . first develop report quantitative estimation RBF use dynamic PET H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O. Kudomi et al . demonstrate feasibility measurement RBF use PET H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O human ( 63 ) .H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O convenient short half-life ( 2 minute ) .It allows repeat measure short interval 15 minute . Furthermore , H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O fully diffusible tracer without dependency tubular function it´s nephrotoxic . Irradiation patient low . Only two study renal perfusion PET find literature . Koivuviita et al . studied effect revascularisation renal artery stenosis renal perfusion patient atherosclerotic renovascular disease ( ARVD ) use PET . The cortical renal perfusion correlate degree stenosis renal artery , increase revascularization . The mean cortical renal perfusion value healthy control significantly high CKD-patients . Moreover , RBF low diabetic non-diabetic ARVD patients.In study Alpert et al . 5 subject normal renal function 10 moderate severe renal disease . In CKD group also 4 renal transplant patient . The RBF significantly high healthy control CKD group . There renal perfusion study do PET kidney transplant patient . Renal flow reserve Renal flow reserve ( RFR ) capacity renal circulation augment renal bloodflow . It possible endothelial dysfunction renal microvasculature decrease RFR . Furthermore , decrease RFR could sign pathologic process kidney parenchyma . Beregi et al . show combination angiography intravascular Doppler pig RFR less marked CFR . Hollenberg et al study renal vasomotion scintigraphic xenon-technique . The increase renal blood flow 20-35 % normotensive patient . Phentolamine , acetylcholine diltiazem dose renal artery , teprotide intravenously captopril orally dose 10-25 mg.Manoharan et al.used intrarenal Doppler angiography estimate vasodilatory capacity renal microvasculature normotensive normoglycemic adult normal kidney function . The normal renal flow reserve average 2 . PAH clearance use method IgA nephropathy study Coppo et al.. The influence oral captopril 50 mg PAH clearance effective renal bloodflow ( ERBF ) CKD patient moderate renal impairment healthy control evaluate . The ERBF increase significantly group captopril . The tendency low basal flow value CKD group see compare control . There study do PET evaluate change renal blood flow . Juillard et al . demonstrate pig study angiotensin II reduce RBF dopamine increase . They also estimate RBF mean PET use H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O quinaprilat injection ( 10 mg ) eight men hypertension moderate CRF . Baseline ERPF decrease significantly . PET-RBF increase significantly quinaprilat injection . No RFR-studies do kidney transplant patient . Renal flow reserve kidney transplantation The slowly deteriorating renal transplant still major concern nephrologists . Sequential biopsy may help predict subsequent develop allograft nephropathy procedure highly invasive . Renal blood flow renal flow reserve may informative predict renal transplant function.However , neither study renal blood flow reserve renal blood flow do PET base methodology kidney recipient . STUDY DESIGN One part study prospective longitudinal follow-up study part retrospective cohort study . The centre involve study Turku University Hospital Nephrology department Turku PET centre . 1 . .CFR measured PET kidney transplant patient diabetes without diabetes whose GFR 30 - 45 ml/min . The kidney transplant age 3+/- 1 year ( retrospective ) . 2 . .CFR dialysis patient kidney wait list measure PET dialysis time one year kidney transplantation ( prospective ) .
