	<detailed_description>Due grow interest track personal health wellness information , use wearable fitness tracker become necessary tool provide track data . However , potential benefit tool fully realize adoption use tracker sustain . The decision engage physical activity ( ) complex , therefore , investigator attempt engage people physical activity program consider adopt individualize approach barrier management take account personal belief perception regard physical activity , set goal addition use `` engagement engine '' design specifically study . The primary objective phase 2 study test `` engagement engine '' support successful sustain engagement health tracker thereby increase physical activity . The study recruit total 138 participant general public via Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) research broadcast e-serve list , study website , flyer study informational table MGH-affiliated health clinic . Participants enroll study consent remotely screen consent take place online study website . After consent process , enrol participant instruct download FitBit smartphone application provide study staff authorization collect step data tracker . The enrollment process involve complete set enrollment question relate general health , barrier physical activity , exercise regulation , Prochaska 's stage change , demographic technology use via web link study website . Next research analyst mail copy consent form , wearable activity tracker ( Fitbit Charge ) device instruction via traceable mail research participant .

It hop data collect study allow investigator assess engagement engine could potentially use help individual remain engaged physical activity tracker thereby sustain regular physical activity . The risk potential inadvertent release Protected Health Information take seriously . Investigators take several step minimize risk much possible . Data collect paper store locked cabinet PCH , accessible research staff . For purpose study , participant ask authorize PCH database access store activity data activity tracker server . This do use secure , OAUTH procedure participant ask enter account username password . The OAUTH process store information PCH/study website , make secure confidential method participant enable PCH study staff access activity data . Activity data retrieve FitBit app store password protect server maintain PCH Information Systems . At conclusion study participant change account user setting study website revoke PCH study database access account data . Participants instructed process close-out study .</detailed_description>
