	<detailed_description>Creatine monohydrate popular nutritional supplement athlete involve sport involve strength power . When creatine orally ingest combine inorganic phosphate form phorylcreatine ( PCr ) skeletal muscle . Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) immediate source energy muscle - exercise ATP break Adenosine Diphosphate ( ADP ) inorganic phosphate . Duration high-intensity exercise limit second base limited ATP store muscle . PCr act re-phosphorylate ADP form ATP muscle contraction continue high intensity . After creatine monohydrate ingest , high-intensity exercise capacity increase increased PCr store muscle . Delivra Inc. develop topical cream contain creatine design penetrate skin . The study purpose determine whether topical cream , two different dos , effective improve muscular strength power . The hypothesis experimental topical creatine cream effective placebo cream improve muscular performance two consecutive application creatine cream effective single application improve muscular performance . The study involve involve double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group design . Participants ( n=132 ) randomize receive either low dose ( 3.5 mL ) high dose ( 7 mL ) topical creatine . The baseline assessment involve measure muscular power 5 set 15 repetition knee extension dynamometer , set separate 1 minute rest , leg test separately . At least 72 hour baseline testing , participant receive either high low dose topical creatine cream apply quadriceps one leg . The high-dose group receive 3.5 mL creatine cream 30 minute 15 minute one leg ( randomize ) exercise test ( i.e . test perform visit 2 ) . They receive 3.5 mL placebo cream 30 15 minute opposite leg testing . The low-dose group receive placebo cream 30 minute test creatine cream 15 minute test one leg ; receive placebo cream 30 15 minute test opposite leg . Testing leg involve measure muscular power 5 set 15 repetition knee extension dynamometer , set separate 1 minute rest . The primary outcome average peak power output .</detailed_description>
