	<brief_summary>Muscles , paretic spastic , cerebral palsy child early , growth ( three five age ) , every alteration property . Gastrocnemius muscle , often reach cerebral palsy , characterise modification structure ( volume decrease ) elasticity ( increase passive stiffness ) . Every alteration muscular property impact clinic functional important . The many treatment orthopaedic target ( lengthen cast , injection botulinic toxin ) , repeat multiple recovery growth influence muscular characteristic . There real interest measure muscular property development child 's growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Elastography technical assessment characteristic soft tissue . In area , method `` Supersonic Shear ImagingÂ® ( SSI ) `` provide important technological change measuring , swiftly invasive , elasticity modulus reflect property visco-elastic muscle . A lot ex vivo study lead isolated muscle vivo healthy adult demonstrate validity method SSI evaluation passive stiffness number muscle group whose gastrocnemius muscle . The main objective study must check intersession reproducibility method SSI evaluation passive stiffness medial bundle gastrocnemius muscle therefore passive lengthen cerebral palsy child . The secondary objective test correlation level relation elasticity modulus/ joint angle couple force-angle obtain throughout passive lengthen medial bundle gastrocnemius muscle cerebral palsy child .</detailed_description>
