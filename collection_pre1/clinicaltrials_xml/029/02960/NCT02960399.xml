	<brief_title>Assessment Immunogenicity Zostavax® Patients With Antibody Deficiency 60 Years Age Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common variable immune deficiency ( CVID ) , specific antibody deficiency ( SAD ) , X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) among common primary antibody deficiency mainstay treatment gammaglobulin replacement . The use high dos immunoglobulin replacement therapy early recognition co-morbid disease course CVID , SAD , XLA improve survival lead age population CVID , SAD , XLA patient . The Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend routine vaccination person age &gt; 60 year 1 dose vaccine direct herpes zoster ( Zostavax® ) absence contraindication . Current standard care include avoidance vaccine receive gammaglobulin product due passive immunity obtain gammaglobulin vaccine preventable infection . The exception rule patient gammaglobulin receive yearly influenza vaccine due enhance cell mediate immunity influenza virus . Clinical immunologist currently data upon advise patient receive gammaglobulin replacement include CVID , SAD , XLA concern use Zostavax® . All gammaglobulin replacement product maintain protective antibody level VZV . However , humoral immune response anti-VZV antibody relatively constant protect development shingle . Varicella zoster virus specific cell mediate immunity ( VZV-CMI ) , T cell dependent , critical component prevent herpes zoster ( shingle ) . VZV-CMI diminishes age leave elderly susceptible shingle . Several study conclude boost VZV-CMI protects old adult develop herpes zoster postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . Recommendations prevention herpes zoster publish Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) Centers disease control ( CDC ) May 2008 make follow statement : 1 . Zoster vaccine administer person primary acquire immunodeficiency include : . Persons clinical laboratory evidence unspecified cellular immunodeficiency . 2 . Persons impaired humoral immunity ( e.g. , hypogammaglobulinemia dysgammaglobulinemia ) can/should receive zoster vaccine . The investigator hypothesize vaccination Zostavax® adult CVID , SAD , XLA evidence normal cell mediate immunity normal T cell quantity function boost VZV-CMI thereby reduce susceptibility shingle PHN . Successful completion study provide clinical immunologist data upon advise antibody deficient patient concern use Zostavax® .</detailed_description>
