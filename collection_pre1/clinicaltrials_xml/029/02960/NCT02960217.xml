	<brief_title>Crossover Study Assess Efficacy Safety UX007 Treatment Movement Disorders Associated With Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome ( Glut1 DS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UX007G-CL301 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study assess efficacy safety UX007 Glut1 DS . The study enroll approximately 40 pediatric , adolescent , adult subject KD disable paroxysmal movement disorder . A movement disorder event define study period time subject experience one movement disorder symptom , include symptom experience movement disorder event alone significant worsen continuous movement disorder . In study , movement disorder event define disable affect limit subject 's activity daily live . During 6-week Run-in Period , subject record disable paroxysmal movement disorder event daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary ; minimum criterion number event meet subject complete &lt; 80 % daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary , subject consider screen failure randomize . Individuals may allow rescreen , discretion Principal Investigator , subject approval Medical Monitor . At end Run-in Period , eligible subject randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) one two treatment sequence ( UX007/placebo placebo/UX007 ) . At Randomization , subject begin 10-week double-blind Treatment Period 1 . Treatment Period 1 consist 2-week titration period 8-week Maintenance Period . At end Treatment Period 1 , subject discontinue treatment begin 2-week washout period minimize potential carryover effect . Subjects crossover second randomize , double-blind treatment assignment ( placebo UX007 , UX007 placebo ) additional 10 week Treatment Period 2 . Treatment Period 2 consist 2-week titration period 8-week Maintenance Period . At end blind crossover period ( Week 22 ) , active subject option roll open-label Extension Period , continue UX007 treatment 3 year one follow occurs : subject withdraws consent , subject discontinue study discretion Investigator , study terminate , commercial availability study drug subject 's region , whichever occur first . Long-term safety maintenance effect UX007 assess open-label Extension Period . A Safety Follow-up Phone Call conduct 30-35 day last dose UX007G-CL301 study drug .</detailed_description>
