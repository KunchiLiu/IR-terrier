	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate dose High Dose Rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy choose study well commonly use alternate form brachytherapy call low dose rate ( seed ) brachytherapy . Investigators would like understand treatment control prostate cancer look short long term treatment related side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II High Dose Brachytherapy Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy Monotherapy Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy accept treatment help manage low intermediate risk prostate cancer . Radiation therapy give use machine outside body ( call `` image guide external beam radiation therapy '' ) brachytherapy , form radiation therapy radiation source place directly prostate gland near tumour . The standard usual treatment low intermediate risk prostate cancer low dose-rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy involve place radioactive seed prostate deliver radiation several month , image guide external beam radiation therapy ( IGRT ) , IGRT plus high dose-rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy boost . High Dose-Rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy another type brachytherapy delivers high dose radiation tumour period minute . The radiation deliver computer control flexible needle , temporarily insert prostate . This form radiotherapy target cancer cell within prostate gland . HDR brachytherapy another type radiotherapy prostate cancer potential help target cancer accurately cause few side effect compare standard radiation therapy . HDR brachytherapy option treatment hospital best dose radiation still unknown . This study test new dose radiation HDR brachytherapy .</detailed_description>
