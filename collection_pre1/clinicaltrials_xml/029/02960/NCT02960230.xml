	<criteria>Stratum A : Newly diagnose child ( 321 year old ) DIPG positive H3.3K27M mutation ( positive test CLIA laboratory ) underwent standard radiation therapy . Stratum B : • Newly diagnose child ( 321 year old ) diagnosis glioma DIPG positive H3.3K27M mutation ( positive test CLIA laboratory ) include spinal cord glioma underwent standard radiation therapy . The following eligibility criterion apply Stratum A B . The patient must test positive HLAA2 ( human leukocyte antigen A2 ) ( CLIA approve laboratory ) The patient must evaluable disease define section 7.2.1.2 The patient must either steroid stable dose dexamethasone ( max 0.1 mg/kg/day ; maximum 4mg/day ) time enrollment Patients must receive prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy bone marrow transplant treatment tumor . Prior use temozolomide radiation standard pediatric dose dexamethasone allow . Patients must undergo radiation therapy surgery part standard care . Radiation therapy must start within 28 day diagnosis imaging surgery , whichever later . Karnofsky ≥ 50 patient ≥ 16 year age , Lansky ≥ 50 patient &lt; 16 year age ( See Appendix A ) . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . The patient must adequate organ function define : Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion least 7 day prior enrollment ) . Adequate Renal Function Defined : Creatinine clearance radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 70mL/min/1.73 m2 A serum creatinine base age/gender follow : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) Male Female 1 . 2 year 0.6 0.6 2. &lt; 6 year 0.8 0.8 6 &lt; 10 year 1 1 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 1.4 The threshold creatinine value table derive Schwartz formula estimate GFR utilize child length stature data publish CDC .
