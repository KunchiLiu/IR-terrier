In study , would like compare effectiveness antiemetic agent technique cause less severe adverse reaction mother fetus . Out available pharmacological agent reduction intra-cesarean section nausea vomiting , transdermal scopolamine patch one safest medication . We would like compare effectiveness transdermal scopolamine patch acupressure point P6 stimulation versus transdermal scopolamine patch versus acupressure point P6 stimulation .</detailed_description>
