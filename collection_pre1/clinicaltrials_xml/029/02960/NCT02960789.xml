	<brief_title>Hydration Status Evaluation Dehydrated Children With Experimental Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study determine performance two prototype device develop aid diagnosis monitor physiological hydration state dehydrate child . These child patient present emergency department vary degree dehydration . Overview study procedure : 1 . Initial identification eligible patient . Patients initially identify chief complaint registration triage . Terms `` Dehydration '' , `` Gastroenteritis '' , `` Diarrhea '' , `` Vomiting '' , `` Intolerance POs '' note patient approach study personnel possible participation study . 2 . Screening obtain consent After patient identified meeting entry criterion study , parent ask two screen question : 1 . How far distance live hospital ? 2 . Would interested study include follow-up home visit ? These question use gauge ability family realistically complete study , research coordinator travel home conduct follow visit symptom resolution . 3 . Study enrollment . Risks benefit study participation discuss , well consent process . After consent obtain , symptom survey administer patient family determine degree dehydration base clinical assessment . Detailed information regard onset degree symptom include vomiting , diarrhea , urine output amount oral fluid intake record . A similar survey administer part randomize control trial Dextrose containing fluid , conduct Emergency Department , ( Levy , Waltzman ) . ii . Each patient his/her weight obtain use calibrated digital scale dry diaper underwear appropriately size gown . Then study device utilized study personnel obtain three triplicate measurement . Replicate measurement capillary refill time also obtain location visual inspection use commercial stopwatch . Additional information include ambient room temperature , patient skin temperature amount applied pressure Capillary Refill Time measurement record . iii . After initial measurement obtain , treat provider give questionnaire outline assessment degree dehydration patient study protocol . Patients treat per discretion health care provider include admission hospital discharge base clinical judgment . Device measurement provide treat clinician . Measurements obtain device bear clinical treatment patient . All measurement obtain relation study use solely research purpose . Device measurement capillary refill time radio-frequency measurement , initial weight disclose treating staff . iv . Prior either discharge emergency department admission hospital , participate family give symptom log serve method objectively track degree symptom follow period . 4 . Initial follow monitoring symptom resolution : A research coordinator call patient 's family phone within 24-72 hour initial enrollment . He establish contact family explain follow plan monitor symptom resolution . Regular follow phone every 48 hour continue symptom resolve ; time in-person follow visit plan within 24-72 hour . 5 . In-person follow-up After resolution symptom ( vomit and/or diarrhea ) , research coordinator travel residence patient repeat measurement include weight device measurement . Again weight perform calibrated digital scale patient dry diaper underwear appropriately size gown . Also , study coordinator ask family/patient answer question related duration illness , visit medical provider occur interim . The radio-frequency capillary refill time measurement store secure de-identified server , remain data record enter password-protected digital database use RedCap .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Dehydration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Dehydrated child , indicate primarily chief complaint symptom vomit , diarrhea , dehydration , gastroenteritis intolerance oral intake less equal 5 day 1 . Previously enrol study 2 . Children preexist medical condition may potentially affect either course nature current illness , skin condition potential alter capillary refill time , specifically : a. Preexisting medical condition i. Immunosuppression ( HIV , malignancy ) ii . Existing gastrointestinal condition ( Inflammatory bowel disease , Crohns disease , ulcerative colitis , recent abdominal surgery within prior 30 day ) iii . Uncorrected palliated cardiac disease iv . Other chronic medical condition asthma eczema ( cystic fibrosis , diabetes , patient indwell device gastrostomy , nasogastric nasojejunal tube , ventriculoperitoneal shunt b . Concern surgical abdomen i. Abdominal trauma head trauma reason visit ii . Potential surgical condition ( concern appendicitis , intussusception , malrotation , volvulus , bowel obstruction ) c. Skin condition may alter optical radiofrequency measurement , cause discomfort i. Acanthosis ii . Severe eczema cover expose test site measure capillary refill iii . Burns</criteria>
