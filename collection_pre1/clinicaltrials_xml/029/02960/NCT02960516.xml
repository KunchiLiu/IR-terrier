	<brief_summary>It estimate 5 % admission level one trauma center peripheral nerve injury . These peripheral nerve injury may devastate impact quality life require month year regain function . Neurotmesis , peripheral nerve transection , common injury , singly cut nerve laceration account 60 % peripheral nerve surgical intervention civilian study . For recovery occur patient , axon must grow site repair target tissue , length meter human . By time , revisional surgery may viable option due onset irreversible muscle atrophy - transect nerve estimate induce loss achievable function approximately 1 % every 6 day delay . The scenario even bad proximal nerve injury , occur brachial plexus . The investigator aim longitudinally assess diffusion tensor tractography ( DTI ) order optimize , validate , translate ability DTI monitor , importantly , predict nerve regrowth follow trauma surgical repair . The overall objective study evaluate ability ( DTI ) monitor , importantly , predict nerve regrowth follow crush cut surgical repair . The investigator hypothesize additional information available via DTI improve ability monitor predict nerve regrowth follow surgical repair severe crush injury , guide clinical management either toward away surgical intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although nerve transfer reduce length axonal growth require , failure still occur revision rarely option due aforementioned delays detection . Current neurodiagnostics [ e.g. , electromyography ( EMG ) , nerve conduction study ( NCS ) ] limited utility severely damaged nerve , provide incomplete picture nerve microstructural feature target reinnervation occurs . Thus , physician limit `` wait watch '' approach base qualitative measure obtain patient history and/or physical exam . This lead suboptimal management peripheral nerve injury , turn lead increase instance irreversible muscle atrophy , paralysis , and/or formation painful traumatic neuroma . In term military , extremity injury account 54 % combat wound Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Enduring Freedom recent review service member injury Operation Enduring Freedom note significant increase brachial plexus , ulnar , radial nerve injury attributable modern warfare . In addition , symptomatic neuroma occur 13 % 32 % amputee , cause pain limit preventing use prosthetic device . Take example wound warrior shrapnel injury his/her elbow , result loss ulnar nerve segment . Even nerve graft perform , true recovery ( motor and/or sensory innervation hand ) could take year typical circumstance . If repair fails , occur 40 % patient failure typically truly recognize year expire use current management protocol . By time , revisional surgery typically viable option due aforementioned onset irreversible muscle atrophy . In additional inability effectively monitor nerve recovery repair , diagnosis peripheral nerve injury difficult use currently available method . For example , neurotmesis common , difficult distinguish , diagnosis follow traumatic iatrogenic extremity injury . Current electrodiagnostic clinical examination invasive , time consuming , painful . In addition , perfectly discriminate severe axonotmetic laceration self-resolving neurapraxic injury acute set . This particularly important penetrate injury , iatrogenic nerve injury result nerve block , intraoperative position external compression , degree axonal injury unknown .</detailed_description>
