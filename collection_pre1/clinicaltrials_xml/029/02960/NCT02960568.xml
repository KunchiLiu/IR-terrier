	<brief_summary>The investigator propose 2D6 ( Cytochrome P-450 Isoenzyme 2D6 ) genotype phenotype group active duty service member assess effect primaquine metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Variability CYP2D6 U.S Active Duty Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose enroll group active duty service member order determine individual ' 2D6 isoenzyme genotype , enzyme belong hepatic cytochrome P450 oxidase system . The 2D6 isoenzyme key enzyme involved metabolism many drug include anti-malarial drug primaquine ( PQ ) . By know genotype , investigator categorize volunteer CYP2D6 phenotype i.e. , expect impact drug metabolism . In order substantiate relationship CYP2D6 activity , inadequate metabolism subsequent primaquine failure , investigator proposes assess effect 2D6 genetic polymorphism PQ metabolism measure PQ pharmacokinetics ( PK ) 24 hour follow single 30 mg oral dose subset Active Duty subject .</detailed_description>
