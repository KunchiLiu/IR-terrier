	<brief_summary>Falling common among individual incomplete spinal cord injury ( iSCI ) , fall occur walk . Falls result injury ( e.g. , broken bone ) , hospital readmission , reduce participation work recreation . In able-bodied people , fall prevent take one rapid , reactive step . People iSCI , however , difficulty take reactive step need prevent fall . Research elderly people stroke show repetitive training reactive step safe environment improve balance reaction prevents fall . The investigator examine feasibility effectiveness reactive step train people iSCI . The main objective determine reactive balance training lead great improvement balance reaction , score clinical scale , fall rate compare conventional walk training . A three year , pilot randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) complete . By improve balance reduce fall , people iSCI experience few complication ( e.g. , injury ) , great recovery function community participation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research aim determine perturbation-based training ( PBT ) lead great improvement balance reaction , score clinical scale , fall rate compare conventional gait training . The investigator hypothesize individual iSCI participate PBT show significantly great gain : 1 ) ability take reactive step lean-and-release test , evidence reduction time take initiate reaction , number step take regain balance ; 2 ) clinical measure gait , balance , balance self-efficacy . The investigator also hypothesize individual participate PBT experience few fall 6 month follow train conventional training group . All 24 participant iSCI complete 2 baseline assessment space 2 week apart . The participant randomize perturbation-based training conventional gait training ( 12 participants/group ) use match pair design . Participants match base AIS level ( C D ) age ( &lt; 60 year &gt; 60 year ) . For program , dosage 3 sessions/week 8 week , session last 1 hour . After training , follow-up assessment , include lean-and-release test clinical measure , complete 3 6 month post-training . PBT conventional gait training deliver graduate student background Physical Therapy Kinesiology supervise licensed physical therapist . PBT consist repetitive practice reactive step 1 hour . Participants experience 60 perturbation per session stand walk activity , stand compliant surface eye close , step target ground , step sideways . To create perturbation , researcher apply unexpected push pull safety harness around participant 's trunk . The perturbation sufficient magnitude elicit step response participant . Conventional training consist treadmill ( 0.5 hr ) over-ground ( 0.5 hr ) gait training . On treadmill , participant walk fast long possible . Body weight-support may use , need . During over-ground walking , participant practice similar activity PBT group , perturbation apply . After train period , participant follow 6 month track occurrence consequence fall . If participant experience fall , he/she ask complete short survey ( online paper ) within 24 hour fall . A researcher maintain monthly contact participant ensure fall document . Assessments perform twice baseline period , 4 8 week training , 3 6 month post-training participate RCT . The lean-and-release test administer research team due technical expertise require . All measure administer license PTs blind study purpose training allocation . The lean-and-release test quantify ability take reactive step . Participants stand force plate lean forward 5-10 % body weight support horizontal cable . The cable release unpredictable time , participant must take reactive step forward onto second force plate . Ground reaction force surface electromyography leg ( rectus femoris , vastus lateralis , biceps femoris , soleus , medial gastrocnemius , tibialis anterior ) record . The lean-and-release test good test-retest reliability old adult . The Mini-Balance Evaluation System 's Test assess four balance control system , include postural response perturbation . This scale use SCI , show good validity reliability stroke Parkinson 's disease . The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale questionnaire balance self-efficacy . Participants rate confidence ability maintain balance perform 16 functional task . It use individual SCI good psychometric property stroke . Spatio-temporal gait parameter , step width double support time , collect Zeno Walkway ( ProtoKinetics ) . All electromyography ( EMG ) , force plate motion capture data sample 1 kHz . The EMG signal amplify bandpass filter 20-500Hz . EMG force plate signal use determine time reactive step , elicit lean-and-release test . The magnitude activity muscle reactive step evaluate use root mean square muscle 's EMG . The Shapiro-Wilk test use test assumption normality . To compare outcomes 2 training program , one-way repeated measure ANOVA Friedman 's Test use . The alpha level set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
