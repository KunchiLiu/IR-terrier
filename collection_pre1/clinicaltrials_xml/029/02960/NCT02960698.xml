	<brief_summary>Tourette syndrome ( TS ) characterize presence multiple vocal motor tic . Behavioral disorder associate TS common , particularly impulsivity , anti-sociality socially inappropriate behavior . Specifically , cognitive impulsivity could source trouble . Its anatomical substrate base connection frontal striatal area . Initially , battery behavioral test measure different type impulsivity ( motor , cognitive decision ) administer three group subject : TS : 80 patient ( 40 patient treat 40 untreated ) 40 healthy volunteer . Then , investigator study fronto-striatal connection TS group 80 patient ( 40 patient treat 40 untreated ) compare 40 healthy volunteer use neuroimaging technique ( 3T MRI ) . The technique use functional connectivity study `` rest state '' MRI ( RS-fMRI ) combine reconstruction white matter fiber diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Behavioral performance correlate correlation image data highlight functional anatomical substrate impulsivity patient TS . Finally , investigator look specifically use functional MRI activation , anatomical functional substrate three type impulsivity ( motor , cognitive decision-making ) . Through study , investigator hope elucidate anatomical functional base cognitive impulsivity patient TS thus lay basis target treatment .</brief_summary>
