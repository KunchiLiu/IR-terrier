	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , multicentral clinical trial investigate efficacy Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Receptor Ⅱ IgG Fc fusion protein injection ( Yisaipu® ) treatment peripheral enthesitis active axial spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) patient . Mardird sonographic enthesis index ( MASEI ) one wide use score system peripheral enthesitis one base OMERACT definition enthesopathy EULAR . The primary purpose ass MASEI discover value US diagnosis prognosis . The second prupose assess different maintain treatment programme SpA patient improvement MASEI . The trial include 96 patient stable NSAIDs therapy , first stage receive 24-week full-dose Yisaipu® . Then second stage patient achieve low disease activity ( LDA , ASDAS &lt; 2.1 ) 24th week randomizedly divide three group : full-dose Yisaipu® group , half-dose Yisaipu® group placebo group . And blind stage last 24 week . Patients complete 48-week therapy achieve disease-flare criterion blind stage would finish study .</brief_summary>
