	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Shoulder pain third common musculoskeletal disorder observe primary care consultation low back neck pain . In absence successful outcome follow conservative intervention , shoulder surgery common procedure conduct multitude surgical indication , include rotator cuff tear , instability stiffness . However , 22 % patient develop chronic shoulder pain ( CSP ) follow shoulder surgery . The consequence chronic persistent postsurgical pain result high socio-economic burden , term suffer reduce quality life individual , also , consider subsequent cost healthcare social service . Pain neuroscience education ( PNE ) show effective therapeutic strategy increase knowledge understand neurobiology , neurophysiology processing pain , change pain belief , improve patient 's skill encourage physical social activity different chronic pain condition . The primary aim study evaluate whether perioperative PNE effective classical biomedical education reduce pain disability patient undergo shoulder surgery . The secondary aim analyse whether perioperative PNE effective classical biomedical education reduce postoperative healthcare cost improve surgical experience patient undergo shoulder surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study 6-month randomize control trial carry March 2017 Aug 2017 regional hospital ( secondary care set ) province Malaga , Spain . Participants schedule shoulder surgery fulfil inclusion criterion ask participate study . The outcome assess baseline ( week precede surgery ) 3 follow-ups time ( 1 week , 1 month 6 month ' post-surgery t1-t4 ) . All patient schedule shoulder surgery participate hospital meeting age criterion contact telephone interview give consent . The initial telephone interview serf provide verbal description project screen potential study participant in- exclusion criterion ( see ) . People deem likely eligible willing participate study schedule baseline assessment week surgery . Furthermore , receive write information study via mail e-mail . Prior undertake baseline assessment , opportunity ask question ask provide write informed consent . Anonymized age , gender visual analogue scale- verbal numerical rating scale ( VAS-VNRS ) pain collect participant decline take part project , assess external validity recruit sample participant . Participants expect start new treatment medication usual pre- postoperative care 3 week prior study participation . Participants complete several questionnaire baseline , 1 week , 1 month 6 month ' post-intervention apart biomedical education PNE intervention . Retention participant encourage researcher provide write feedback participant result `` health screening '' , maintain interest study material mailing send participant process use reminder upcoming data collection . Participant data file store numerical order secure accessible place manner . Participant file maintain storage period 3 year completion study .</detailed_description>
