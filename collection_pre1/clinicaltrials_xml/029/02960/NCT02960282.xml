	<brief_title>Gut Microbiome Fecal Samples From Patients With Metastatic Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantitatively determine composition microflora gene protein expression level patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) base chemotherapy , anti-PD1 immunotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare change specie composition metabolic activity ( determine primary objective ) response chemotherapy immunotherapy . II . Compare change specie composition metabolic activity ( determine primary objective ) toxicity side effect result chemotherapy immunotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection fecal specimen baseline , prior start course chemotherapy immunotherapy , end week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , end course 3 course thereafter chemotherapy immunotherapy , time disease progression go off-treatment . Fecal specimen analyze via 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) gene sequence , meta-transcriptomics analysis , meta-proteomics analysis .</detailed_description>
