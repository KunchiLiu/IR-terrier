	<brief_summary>Dried fruit show promise potential management blood glucose . Previous trial report beneficial effect raisins post-prandial glucose insulin response healthy individual compare white bread . However , date limit data evaluate potential beneficial effect dry fruit ( i.e . sultana , date apricots ) . It also unclear whether dry fruit use low postprandial glycemic response high-GI carbohydrate food either displace available carbohydrate ( displacement effect ) provide 'catalytic ' dos fructose ( 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) . To address question , investigator propose assess GI 4 common type dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date , apricot ) ( GI effect ) ability decrease postprandial glycemic response white bread either partially displace available carbohydrate ( displacement effect ) provide 'catalytic ' dose fructose ( 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dried Fruit Postprandial Glycemia Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : All study assess glycemic index ( GI ) traditional dried fruit show low-to-moderate GI food insulin response proportional GI . A recent study compare glycemic response two dos raisin ( 28 69g ) versus white bread show dos raisins significantly reduce post-prandial glucose insulin level compare white bread . However , effect combine dry fruit high-GI carbohydrate food never address . The potential impact combine nut ( i.e . pistachio ) high-GI carbohydrate food already analyze positive result . The investigator find dose 56g pistachio consume alone minimal effect post-prandial glycemia , take high-carbohydrate meal attenuate relative glycemic response . Although food high fibre content generally low-GI , factor also contribute food 's glycemic response . Factors think contribute glycemic response dry fruit include viscous texture chew ; whole food matrix ; presence phenolic compound organic acid type sugar present . In case dry fruit , 50 % fructose ( low-GI ) present . Therefore , consumption dry fruit high-carbohydrate food may lead glycemic control benefit lower GI food . In addition potentially lower GI food , dry fruit may also affect glycemic control provide 'catalytic ' dos fructose . Fructose , metabolite fructose-1-P , show `` catalytic '' effect hepatic glucose metabolism induce glucokinase activity hepatocytes . In specific , fructose-1-P displaces fructose-6-P glucokinase 's regulatory binding protein nucleus cause release glucokinase regulatory protein , allow translocate cytosol , result increase phosphorylation glucose . Infusion study humans show mechanism relate ~30 % decrease hepatic glucose output hyperglycemic condition participant type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) ~3-fold increase glycogen synthesis C13-nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy euglycemic condition healthy people . Clinical translation finding proven promise . Catalytic dos fructose 7.5g 10g show decrease postprandial glycemic response high GI meal ( oral glucose , maltodextrins , mash potato ) ~15-30 % healthy participant pre-diabetes diabetes . These acute effect show sustainable long term well . Systematic review meta-analyses control feed trial show small dos fructose exchange carbohydrate decrease HbA1c level exceeds clinically meaningful threshold 0.3 % propose Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) development new oral anti-hyperglycemic agent . Therefore , consumption dry fruit high-carbohydrate food may lead glycemic control benefit act vehicle 'catalytic ' dos fructose . OBJECTIVES : To investigate effect use dry fruit modify glycemic response high GI food , investigator propose follow 3 objective : 1 . To assess GI 4 common type dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date , apricot ) ( GI effect ) 2 . To assess ability 4 common type dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date , apricot ) decrease postprandial glycemic response white bread displace half available carbohydrate ( displacement effect ) 3 . To assess ability 4 common type dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date , apricot ) decrease postprandial glycemic response white bread provide 'catalytic ' dose ( 7.5g ) fructose ( 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) PARTICIPANTS : The investigator include male non-pregnant female participant age 18-75 year otherwise healthy . DESIGN : The trial use randomize multiple crossover acute-feeding design participant act control . PROTOCOL : The protocol follow ISO 26642:2010 ( en ) , `` Food product — Determination glycaemic index ( GI ) recommendation food classification '' . All participant complete test control food study series . An individual participant normally complete 1 3 test per week least one day . Participants study 7:00 9:30am overnight fast 10-14h . On test occasion subject weigh , two fast blood sample obtain -5 minute ( min ) intervals finger-prick . Then subject start consume test meal . At first bite timer start additional blood sample take 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 min start meal . Before test , blood glucose test record fill subject 's initial , ID number , date , body weight , test meal , time start eat , time take eat , time composition last meal , unusual activity . During 2 hour test subject remain seated . BLOOD SAMPLES : Each finger-prick sample consist total 2-3 drop blood obtain finger prick divide two separate vial . The 2 3 drop capillary blood collect flat-bottomed 5ml plastic tube push cap contain small amount sodium fluoride potassium oxalate anticoagulant preservative . These sample use analyze capillary blood glucose level . The finger-prick sample glucose analysis initially place refrigerator end two hour , place -20°C freezer analysis perform within week . Glucose analysis do use YSI model 2300 STAT analyzer ( Yellow Springs , OH ) . Each subject participate total 15 separate test meal : 3 white bread control meals 3 dried fruit treatment ( dry fruit - GI effect , dry fruit -displacement effect , dry fruit - 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) 4 dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date apricot ) ( Figure 1 ) . The order test meal randomize coordinator blind treatment allocation . Test meal separate minimum 1-day washout . STATISTICAL ANALYSES : Blood glucose area calculate incremental area curve ( iAUC ) use trapezoidal rule peak height maximal incremental rise glucose . The glycemic index test meal calculate use 3 bread meal reference food . Pairwise differences GI white bread control 3 dry fruit treatment ( dry fruit - GI effect , dry fruit - GI displacement effect , dry fruit - 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) 4 dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date apricots ) assess Dunnett 's test SAS ( SAS Inst . Version 8.2 ; Gary , NC ) . EXPECTED RESULTS : The investigator expect dry fruit low-to-moderate GI reduce postprandial glycemic response consume combination high-GI food comparison high-GI food alone . The specific aim study : ( 1 ) quantify GI 4 different type dry fruit ( raisin , sultana , date , apricot ) ( GI effect ) ; ( 2 ) ass ability 4 dry fruit decrease postprandial glycemic response white bread either partially displace available carbohydrate ( displacement effect ) ; ( 3 ) provide 'catalytic ' dose fructose ( 'catalytic ' fructose effect ) . The propose study help identify mechanism dry fruit improve postprandial glycemia consume combination high-GI carbohydrate food assess glucose displacement mechanism along 'catalytic ' fructose mechanism . The result stimulate important industry innovation improve design future clinical investigation ultimately lead use dry fruit effective tool modify glycemic response high carbohydrate food longer-term glycemic control people risk type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
