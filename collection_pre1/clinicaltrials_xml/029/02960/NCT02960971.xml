	<detailed_description>Pain loss function intimately associate reaction nervous system neural damage . A lesion somatosensory nervous system cause mechanical trauma , metabolic disease , neurotoxic chemical , infection tumor invasion may give rise neuropathic pain . Neuropathic pain affect around 8 % population may negatively impact individual 's quality life ; moreover , condition lead significant cost healthcare system society . Not subject lesion develop neuropathic pain , develop neuropathic pain vary degree symptom severity , impact outcome may respond unpredictably treatment . The interaction genetics environmental clinical factor susceptible individual likely contribute variation pain prevalence severity . A good understanding exact nature risk factor interaction ultimately improve patient ' health , term recognize patient risk identify new treatment modality . Genetic , neurophysiological psychological factor influence risk develop persistent pain . It therefore possible describe genetic , neurophysiological psychological profile , particular patient experience neuropathic pain surgery and/or neurotoxic chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
