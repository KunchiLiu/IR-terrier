	<brief_summary>Background : Given experience physician always available 24 hour day , immediately always available echocardiography usually impossible emergency department ( ED ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) . To compensate limitation , investigator investigate offsite expert guide , inexperienced practitioner-performed ultrasonography could effectively perform . In study , investigator aim investigate whether offsite expert effectively evaluate visually estimate ejection fraction ( EF ) watch guide echocardiographic procedure onsite novice examiner use social network video call chat . Methods : sixty patient present ICU require echocardiography include . Sixty novice practitioner without previous experience echocardiography participate . Prior procedure , onsite expert complete echocardiography advance determine EF use modify Simpson 's method ( MSM , Reference value ) . Then , novice physician perform echocardiography offsite expert 's guidance via video call . They obtain parasternal long short axis view EF visually estimate near 5 % ( ex . 40 % , 45 % etc ) offsite expert watch ultrasound video smartphone display . The subject require immediate management due severe symptom exclude study . Interobserver variability calculate onsite expert visually estimate offsite expert assess . The agreement visual estimate EF obtain onsite expert offsite expert via smartphone evaluate linear regression Bland-Altman plot .</brief_summary>
