	<brief_summary>Objective : Evaluate whether task practice virtual environment could provide good performance task real environment perform task virtual environment could enable transfer task real environment vice versa . Method : investigator evaluate 65 old adult gender , age 60-82 year . The investigator apply time coincident task measure perceptual-motor ability perform motor response . The participant divide two group : ) start real interface b ) start virtual interface .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real Virtual Tasks Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty-five older adult sex ( 12 male 53 female ) age 60-82 year ( definition use World Health Organization ) include participation study . Other inclusion criterion include healthy cognitive motor condition understand perform require activity , consist score 24 point Mini Mental State Examination administer test . Material apparatus The investigator apply time coincident task measure perceptual-motor ability perform motor response sync arrival external object certain point . This instrument widely investigate , especially motor learning area . To evaluate motor learn participant use time coincident task , two distinct interface apply follow : 1 . Real environment interface ( RI ) : Bassin Anticipation Timer Model 35580 ( Lafayette Instrument , Indiana , USA ) use represent real environment . This equipment develop test area visual acuity relate eye-hand coordination anticipation . The participant instruct watch light travel runway 32 LEDs ( two runway 16 red LEDs ) . A cue yellow LED light 0.5 second initiate test light run runway . The participant must anticipate light reach target ( last LED ) press button coincide arrival light target . The LCD readout display time difference response arrival light target indicate response early late . 2 . Virtual environment interface ( VI ) : The investigator use virtual coincidence time task base Bassin Anticipation Timer develop Department Electronic Engineering Polytechnic School University São Paulo , updated Information Systems Laboratory University São Paulo . In VI , 10 bubble represent 3D design computer display simultaneously vertical column . The bubble light change gray red sequentially ( i.e . top bottom ) target last bubble ( tenth bubble ) . The task consist movement hand virtual environment produce Microsoft Kinect® sensor moment light reach target bubble , propose RI task . Procedure design The participant divide two group : one group start RI ( RI-group ) , start VI ( VI-group ) . Each participant use dominant hand perform task ( right-handed ) . The task perform 20 trial acquisition , 5 trial retention 5 trial transfer . Acquisition retention perform velocity , transfer increase velocity . Both group perform task two interface . The research provide verbal explanation use instrument participant start task . The task accord interface describe . Virtual interface : Participants seat chair front computer ( MS Windows 64bits , Intel® Core™ i7-4810MQ CPU @ 2.80GHz ) Kinect sensor V1.0 facilitate enable task . The image participant show top righ monitor , hand movement main screen . The movement reach bubble obtain Kinect sensor . The participant move his/her hand pas target bubble . During acquisition retention trial , bubble simulate drop light movement turn light interval 500ms ( level 4 ) position change , transfer light movement increase 250ms ( level 5 ) position . Real interface : Participants stand front Bassin Anticipatory Timer position vertically table . The stand position use real task facilitate participant able see task comfort . Participant orientate press button target light turn ( synchronously target light ) . The dropped light movement , turn LEDs occur interval 100ms ( l MPH ) position change acquisition retention phase , interval 9ms ( 11MPH ) transfer . Due difference number LEDs ( RI ) bubble ( VI ) task , equalize protocol , time start end task phase study , i.e. , 5 second acquisition retention 2.5 second transfer .</detailed_description>
