	<brief_summary>In study , people undergo brain scan functional magnetic imaging ( fMRI ) perform emotional regulation task involve observe either neutral image image know induce negative emotion , instruction either view passively attempt reduce negative affect associate image . Resting state brain scan ( explicit task ) also acquire . Heart rate variability measure rest state scan . While scanner , subject also listen prerecorded audio script life stress another person instruction practice compassion others . In yet another task , respond picture know produce positive negative emotion perform attention relate task . The scan take place least undergoing session methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) assist psychotherapy . Brain scan happen three time : initial scan placebo MDMA-assisted psychotherapy , second scan either two placebo two MDMA session ( depend whether subject placebo MDMA group ) , one final scan conclusion three active MDMA session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diagnosis , live life-threatening illness result symptom similar see Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , symptom may persist even individual recovers , illness go remission . These symptom may include emotional avoidance numbing , difficulty relate connect friend love one , difficulty sleeping , sense foreshorten future , intrusive thought memory related illness . These symptom additional burden individual experience caretaker , reduces quality life . Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) -assisted psychotherapy experimental treatment anxiety disorder , initial finding suggest hold promise treatment PTSD . This study examine brain activity participant enrol investigation safety efficacy MDMA-assisted psychotherapy people anxiety stem diagnosis life-threatening illness see whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy alters emotional reactivity anxiety-provoking material , include positive negative image . The study also examine brain activity related experience self-compassion/empathy response personalize audio script , whether response alter MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . Brain imaging may offer measure neural marker anxiety self-compassion rely self-report . A subset participant study `` Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Pilot Study MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy Anxiety Associated Life-Threatening Illness '' ( NCT02427568 ) without contraindicate factor brain imaging undergo three fMRI scan part observational study . The first scan occur prior experimental session second scan occur two experimental session MDMA placebo-assisted psychotherapy . Participants scan third time complete total three session MDMA-assisted psychotherapy ( include subject originally MDMA-assisted psychotherapy group , well subject placebo group cross complete three active MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session subsequent placebo-assisted psychotherapy . The primary endpoint scan second session MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . During scan session , participant undergo brain scan functional magnetic imaging ( fMRI ) perform emotional regulation task involve observe image possess negative emotional valence . These image draw , emotional valence validate , International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) . Participants instruct either view passively attempt reduce negative affect associate image . In addition , rest state brain scan also acquire subject fixate central cross explicit task . Heart rate variability measure rest state scan . The comparison change brain activity execution emotional regulation task ( compare baseline scan ) receive psychotherapy MDMA placebo , well comparison change rest state functional connectivity , primary outcome measure . Study observation intend assess change response emotion-provoking material several level , notably brain activity response anxiety produce image . While scanner , subject also listen prerecorded audio script life stress another person instruction practice compassion others . In yet another task , subject perform attentional bias task respond dot-probe appear follow brief presentation pair image know produce positive negative emotion brain activity measure reaction time record</detailed_description>
