	<brief_summary>A genomics-based approach target specific gene may explain response biomarkers symptoms supplementation . One objective generate evidence-based recommendation vitamin D supplementation Soldiers often experience musculoskeletal disorder immune dysfunction impact physical performance military readiness . The investigation design address specific aim : 1 ) explore vitamin D status 105 Service Members determine common symptom associated deficiency ; 2 ) examine effect vitamin D level gene expression select gene know influence metabolism , bone density , immune function ; 3 ) evaluate change gene expression group receive high low supplementation , compare healthy control . Follow-up 15 month evaluate circulate vitamin D .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A genomics-based approach target identify candidate gene search variant may explain response observed biomarkers symptoms deficient individual replete . The long-term objective study translate finding next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) technology clinically meaningful data regard vitamin D supplementation Service Members ( SM ) may risk musculoskeletal disorder immune dysfunction impact physical performance military readiness . We propose follow specific aim : 1 ) explore phenotypic expression vitamin D status cohort SM determine common symptom associate deficiency/insufficiency state ; 2 ) examine effect vitamin D level broad gene expression carefully choose candidate gene know influence vitamin D status , bone density , immune function ; 3 ) evaluate change gene expression level within group supplement low vs high vitamin D , compare healthy control , 4 ) examine relationship vitamin D deficiency clinically relevant outcome stress fracture high blood pressure supplementation therapeutic plasma level 25 ( OH ) D. This prospective , randomize , double-blind trial enroll 105 SM Northwest evaluate frequency , symptom , genomic expression vitamin D level use survey instrument , immunologic bone biomarkers , NGS white blood cell pre- post-supplementation oral vitamin D 3 month . Participant follow-up 12 month evaluate maintenance adequate circulating vitamin D ; timeframe represent typical deployment period .</detailed_description>
