	<brief_title>Vedolizumab Monotherapy Vs Combination Therapy With Tacrolimus UC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase III study show patient UC receive vedolizumab high rate clinical response , clinical remission mucosal heal compare placebo3 . Nevertheless , clinical response rate almost 50 % , rate clinical remission 6 week 16.9 . In comparison , ACT trials almost 40 % patient achieve remission week 84 . The delayed onset action vedolizumab monotherapy patient UC may lead high colectomy rate limit use vedolizumab patient active disease require rapid induction remission . Corticosteroids use bridge agent rapidly induce remission . However , steroid refractory dependent disease steroid intolerance common . Furthermore , steroid devastate side effect . Tacrolimus inhibit complexion calcineurin respective cytoplasmic receptor cyclophilin FK-binding protein 12 ( FKBP-12 ) , regulate calmodulin dependent-phosphatase . Tacrolimus find efficacious treatment patient moderate severe UC . Unfortunately , safety profile long term use , drug mostly use induction agent . While switch vedolizumab another drug efficacious lose effectiveness ( start vedolizumab first agent ) beneficious long term , patient need induction agent order achieve remission short period time . Tacrolimus widely use drug prevent implant rejection transplant . Randomized controlled trial show highly effective good response rate even 2 week therapy . In order avoid side effect , tacrolimus usually use limited amount time ( 12-14 week ) , sufficient time induce remission disease . Unfortunately , inflammatory bowel disease , UC recur patient also require maintenance therapy . While tacrolimus use good result long term agent , ideal scenario avoid long term use still potential side effect need strict close monitoring . This long term maintenance agent need keep patient remission . Until recently , ideal agent available purpose , anti-tumor necrosis factor agent ( infliximab adalimumab ) approve ulcerative colitis , combination another agent induce systemic immunosuppression ( case , tacrolimus ) could potentially increase risk infection and/or malignancy . Because vedolizumab gut selective , affect entire immune system post-marketing study confirm safety profile . This make perfect combination agent tacrolimus , theoretically decrease potential side effect increase efficacy . The hypothesis addition tacrolimus induction agent standard regimen vedolizumab increase efficacy drug , decrease rate need colectomy complication quickly improve patient ' quality life without significantly increase risk adverse event .</detailed_description>
