	<criteria>Patient must pathologically cytologically MSKCC confirm esophageal , gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma . Patients must esophageal , gastric gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma HER2 overexpression and/or amplification determine next generation sequence assay , immunohistochemistry ( IHC 3+ ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH+ define HER2 : CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 ) . MSKCC confirmation HER2 status mandatory prior enrollment treatment study . For patient outside HER2 testing , sufficient tissue available HER2 testing repeat MSKCC purpose analysis impact patient 's eligibility . Additional available archival tumor tissue form 1520 unstained slide submit MSKCC future correlative analysis , require prior registration .
