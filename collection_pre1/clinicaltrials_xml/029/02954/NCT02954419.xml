	<brief_summary>This prospective cohort study design examine association blood urine biomarkers ( include genetic variant ) long-term kidney disease progression among 2000 Chinese IgA nephropathy patient relatively normal kidney function ( eGFR≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IgA Nephropathy Biomarkers Evaluation Study ( INTEREST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glomerulonephritis lead cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) China , IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) common primary glomerulonephritis among individual undergo renal biopsy . The outcome IgAN vary highly among individual ; stable renal function lifetime quickly progress ESRD . No biomarker widely apply predict outcome IgAN yet . Previous GWAS study include identified susceptibility loci associate development clinical feature IgAN . In addition , cohort study reveal several genetic locus relate progression IgAN . But , report GWAS study base case-control design , may provide information effect genetic variant progression disease . Previous cohort study focus certain specific candidate gene unbiasedly explore progression relate susceptibility locus . Furthermore , study integrates information whole genomic locus serum urine biomarkers predict long-term progression IgAN . Therefore , design relative large prospective cohort study examine association blood urine biomarkers ( include whole genomic locus ) long-term kidney disease progression among 2000 Chinese IgAN patient relatively normal kidney function ( eGFR≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) .</detailed_description>
