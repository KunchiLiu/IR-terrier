	<brief_summary>Synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastasis , define diagnosis primary colorectal tumour liver metastasis within 12 month , common problem face colorectal hepatobiliary surgeon . ( Adam ) The `` traditional approach '' perform stag resection unless liver resection require limited ( i.e . small wedge peripheral lesion ) . The downside perform stag vs. simultaneous resection patient must undergo two major operation instead one , limit patient 's ability return pre-surgical state health timely fashion , increase health care cost ( Ejaz ) delay start adjuvant chemotherapy . The disadvantage simultaneous approach include long operating room time potentially increase major postoperative complication rate include blood transfusion , surgical site infection , anastomotic leak post-hepatectomy liver failure . Recent data tertiary cancer centre suggest simultaneous resection colon rectum along liver resection magnitude feasible safe . ( Silberhumer ) Although encouraging , data come specific patient highly select institution , result perhaps generalizable . This proposal feasibility study consist pilot single arm prospective study two different large-volume Hepatobiliary Centres patient synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases undergo simultaneous resection colon rectum liver evaluate complication rate ( include calculation comprehensive complication index ) , quality life , cost evaluation , proportion eligible patient recruit 12-month period . The result pilot study provide u information necessary build large multicentre randomize control trial compare stag vs. simultaneous resection synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simultaneous Resection Colorectal Cancer With Synchronous Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 % patient colorectal cancer liver metastases present synchronous disease . ( Manfredi ) Resection colorectal cancer metastasis confine liver show offer long-term survival . ( Norlinger ; Robertson ; Nordlinger ) However , optimal time surgical resection synchronous liver metastasis relation primary tumour well define . Prior retrospective cohort meta-analyses suggest simultaneous approach carry similar postoperative complication perioperative mortality rate . ( Slesser ; Yin ; Martin ; Chua ; Feng ; Reddy ; Jarnagin ; Capussotti ) Most report however , carry significant selection bias , surgeon tend combine limit liver resection `` straightforward '' colorectal resection oppose complex resection . Recent study suggest postoperative complication risk similar even case complex liver resection well complex colon resection rectal cancer resection . ( Silberhumer ; Vigano ) Rectal resection compare colon resection think complex , due : high risk anastomotic leakage , ( Rullier ) use specific surgical procedure , total mesorectal excision ( Heald , MacFarlane ) laparoscopic surgery ( Bonjer ) involvement multidisciplinary team determine use time neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . ( Jeong ; Kapiteijn ) The conclusion study data prospective randomize study need order determine whether simultaneous resection efficient safe . Improvements anesthesia , critical care surgical resection technique liver colorectal surgery enable innovative surgeon institution perform simultaneous resection complex liver colorectal case safe manner , simultaneous approach adopt many surgeon despite lack study rigorous methodology provide good quality data . Simultaneous colorectal liver resection potential advantage decrease total number complication follow surgery , avoid second operation thereby improve patient 's quality life , decrease overall health care cost avoid delay administration postoperative chemotherapy . Although total number complication reduce perform single operation , operate room time high could lead high proportion major postoperative complication due hypothermia , prolong hypovolemia high blood loss . The decision perform simultaneous resection varies greatly surgeon institution , institution mostly perform simultaneous resection , others perform stag resection others perform combination stag simultaneous resection depend patient ' tumour characteristic , usually perform large complex resection stag approach . There certainly standard approach problem continue topic debate amongst surgeon , medical oncologist radiation oncologist . The investigator propose undertake feasibility study , include prospective single arm trial patient synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases undergo simultaneous resection provide u important information prepare large randomize control study simultaneous vs. stag resection . This feasibility study provide valuable data type proportion postoperative complication 90 day follow surgery measure comprehensive complication index ( Slankamenac 2013 ) help u good understand postoperative complication rate simultaneous approach also calculate sample size randomize control trial base primary outcome . This study also help define population include trial ( liver resection vs. major liver resection , etc. ) . Set criterion success feasibility study clearly state proposal order determine possible ethical move forward large trial . The result study could lead change surgical practice introduce innovative approach treat disease , way could improve patient 's quality life decrease postoperative complication number surgical procedure time lead cost saving health care system .</detailed_description>

Patients able provide inform consent . Note : The primary tumour liver metastasis may require neoadjuvant therapy become resectable . Patients follow histology eligible study : adenocarcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma , mixed adenocarcinomaneuroendocrine tumour ( adenocarcinoma neuroendocrine differentiation ) . Patients suspicious colorectal mass probably liver metastasis pathology show high grade dysplasia also eligible long liver resection contemplate part operative plan . 1 . Extrahepatic disease lung . 2 . Tumours treat local transanal excision ( patient undergo transanal total mesorectal excision eligible ) . 3 . Patients require two stage liver resection , prior liver resection . 4 . Pregnant lactate female 5 . Absolute contraindication general anesthesia 6 . Patients require complex multiorgan pelvic resection , i.e . pelvic exenteration : include bladder , female male reproductive organ ; patient require resection another pelvic organ ( include bladder female reproductive organ prostate seminal vesicle ) eligible . 7 . Patients undergoing urgent resection primary tumour due bleed obstruction simultaneous liver resection plan eligible study , patient undergo divert stoma ( loop ileostomy colostomy ) prior resection eligible .</criteria>
