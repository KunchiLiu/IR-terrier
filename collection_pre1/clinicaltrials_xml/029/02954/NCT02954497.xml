	<brief_summary>PumpKIN randomize , multicenter , two-arm trial evaluate investigational Jarvik 2015 VAD versus EXCOR® Pediatric VAD pediatric patient heart failure . This study enroll 88 subject , 44 receive Jarvik 2015 44 receive EXCOR® , 24 site US Canada . The primary objective investigational device exemption ( IDE ) clinical investigation ( 1 ) ass safety investigational Jarvik 2015 evaluation report serious adverse event ( SAEs ) ventricular assist device ( VAD ) support first 180 day post-implant ( 2 ) explore probable benefit investigational Jarvik 2015 evaluate overall survival absence severe neurologic impairment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria All child severe ( Ross New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV ) heart failure despite optimal medical therapy ( INTERMACS profile pediatrics : Profiles 1 2 ) require mechanical circulatory support meet follow criterion : 1 . Males female within weight range : 8.0 Kg ≤ weight ≤ 20.0 Kg 2 . Males female within Body surface area ( BSA ) range : 0.4 m2 ≤ BSA ≤ 0.8 m2 3 . Twoventricle circulation , include cardiomyopathy , repair structural heart disease ( e.g . ALCAPA , aortic stenosis ) acquire heart disease ( e.g. , myocarditis , Kawasaki disease ) 4 . Documented evidence Inability wean ECMO temporary mechanical support OR Inotropedependent , decompensated heart failure inability wean ventilator support OR Inotropedependent , decompensated heart failure AND combination two follow criterion within 48 hour prior implant ( unless otherwise note ) attribute decompensated heart failure despite optimal medical therapy : Urine output &lt; 0.5 cc/Kg/hr Creatinine level &gt; 2 time ULN age ALT total bilirubin result &gt; 3 time ULN age ( either qualify patient ) Mixed venous oxygen saturation ( SvO2 ) &lt; 55 % Inability tolerate enteral feed ( &gt; 75 % maintenance calorie ) ≥7 day Acidosis : Base excess &lt; 5 5 . Potentially eligible ( i.e. , medical surgical contraindication ) list cardiac transplant , United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) status 1A equivalent 6 . Written consent parent ( ) LAR appropriate . Exclusion Criteria To eligible trial , subject must meet none follow exclusion criterion time enrollment enrollment device implant : 1 . Known contraindication systemic anticoagulation 2 . Currently participate interventional trial whose protocol prevents effective application one treatment arm , potentially independent effect trial endpoint , otherwise interfere execution PumpKIN protocol 3 . Any complex cardiac diagnosis ( include limit single ventricle anatomy , restrictive cardiomyopathy ) , opinion investigator , could independently affect likelihood subject meeting primary endpoint 4 . Presence mechanical heart valve 5 . Unresolved malignancy 6 . CPR duration &gt; 30 consecutive minute within 48 hour prior device implant CPR uncertain neurological status prior device implant 7 . The following exclusionary find 24 hour less prior device implant : Renal dysfunction severe , opinion investigator , irreversible Hepatic dysfunction severe , opinion investigator , irreversible Severe irreversible pulmonary dysfunction ECMO use &gt; 10 consecutive day Severe aortic insufficiency Active , systemic infection unresponsive antimicrobial Known cerebrovascular event within past 30 day uncertain neurological status Severe RV dysfunction significant arrhythmia require treatment RV assist device ( RVAD ) ( i.e. , biventricular assist device ) Unmanageable bleed per judgment investigator</criteria>
