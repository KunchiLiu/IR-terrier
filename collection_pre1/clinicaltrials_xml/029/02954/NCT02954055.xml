	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize phase II trial randomise woman ER-positive , HER2-negative ( Human Epidermal Growth factor Receptor 2-negative ) metastatic locally relapse breast cancer ratio 1:1 receive metronomic regimen vinorelbine plus cyclophosphamide capecitabine , conventional paclitaxel monotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prognosis patient locally advance metastatic disease ( ABC ) remain poor , median survival 2-4 year . About 10 % newly diagnose BC patient present ABC , 30 % 50 % patient diagnose earlier stage subsequently develop metastatic disease . In first-line treatment HER2 ( Human Epidermal Growth factor Receptor 2 ) negative ABC patient , various chemotherapy regimen use include taxanes , among active agent BC . Single agent response rate range 20 50 % . However , eventually patient progress median time progression 5 7 month . A weekly ( qw ) three-weekly ( q3w ) administration schedule paclitaxel show effective metastatic well adjuvant set standard chemotherapy The VEX regimen recently investigate within phase II trial currently ongoing European Institute Oncology ( IEO ) ( IEO number IEOS582/111 ; EudraCT Number : 2010-024266-21 ; title : `` A phase II study metronomic oral chemotherapy cyclophosphamide plus capecitabine vinorelbine metastatic breast cancer patient '' ) . Patients receive vinorelbine 40 mg orally day 1 , 3 5 every week , cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily capecitabine 500 mg 3 time day . Given promising activity VEX regimen pre-treated population advance breast cancer patient good tolerability , aim present trial investigate whether VEX schedule may improve efficacy tolerability compare standard paclitaxel treatment advance metastatic ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patient . The concept VEX metronomic treatment administer combination long patient possibility derive benefit . The time treatment failure ( TTF ) choose primary endpoint trial . TTF define time date randomization date final dose trial treatment administer . Chemotherapy may need stop due lack tolerability , lack efficacy patient preference subjective symptom assessment . TTF composite endpoint combine feasibility aspect treatment . It therefore uniquely suit research question current trial . The secondary endpoint progression-free survival , disease control safety allow assessment feasibility VEX metronomic treatment versus paclitaxel monotherapy regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm HER2‐negative locally advance metastatic ( stage IV ) breast cancer . Maximum one prior line chemotherapy advance metastatic breast cancer . Measurable non‐measurable , radiologically evaluable ( except skin lesion ) , disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . Female age 18 year old . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . ER‐positive disease local laboratory , determine recent available tissue ( late biopsy metastatic lesion , otherwise prior biopsy surgical specimen ) . If previously treat taxane neoadjuvant adjuvant setting , period end treatment disease recurrence must &gt; 12 month ( &gt; 365 day ) . Radiation therapy , give regardless site , must complete least 2 week prior randomization . Normal hematologic status , Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3 ( 1.0 × 109/L ) , Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L , Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( ≥ 90 g/L ) . Normal renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min accord CockcroftGault formula . Normal liver function : Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . In case know Gilbert 's syndrome , high serum total bilirubin ( &lt; 3 × ULN ) allow . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × ULN ; patient liver metastasis , ALT AST must ≤ 5 × ULN . Women child bear potential must document negative pregnancy test within 2 week prior randomization agree acceptable birth control ( nonhormonal ) 6 month trial therapy . Written Informed Consent ( IC ) must sign dated patient Investigator prior start screen procedure randomization . The patient inform agree data transfer handling , accordance national data protection guideline . More one prior line chemotherapy advance metastatic breast cancer Previous treatment advance metastatic disease taxanes , capecitabine vinorelbine oral cyclophosphamide . More 2 line previous endocrine therapy locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Known active central nervous system metastasis , indicate clinical symptom , cerebral edema , and/or progressive growth ( patient history Central Nervous System ( CNS ) metastases spinal cord compression eligible clinically radiologically stable least 4 week first dose trial treatment require highdose steroid treatment last 4 week ) . Peripheral neuropathy grade 2 high ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . Significant uncontrolled cardiac disease ( i.e . unstable angina , myocardial infarction within prior 6 month ) , patient classify New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV congestive heart failure . Pregnant lactating . Prior history non‐breast malignancy ( except adequately control basal cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , situ carcinoma bladder ) . Any concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make inappropriate patient participate trial would jeopardize compliance protocol . Contraindications know hypersensitivity trial medication excipients . The use anti‐cancer investigational agent within 30 day prior expect start trial treatment .</criteria>
