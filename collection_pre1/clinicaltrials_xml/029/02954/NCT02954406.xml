	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-659 . TAK-659 test treat people advance non-Hodgkin lymphoma . This study determine MTD RP2D TAK-659 combination bendamustine , bendamustine + rituximab , gemcitabine , lenalidomide , ibrutinib . The study enroll approximately 100 participant . Participants assign one 5 treatment group : - TAK-659 + Bendamustine - TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab - TAK-659 + Gemcitabine - TAK-659 + Lenalidomide - TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This multi-center trial conduct North America Europe . The overall time participate study approximately 27 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic follow safety 28 day last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
