	<brief_summary>We hypothesize regular consumption almond augment long chain fatty acid profile alpha-tocopherol level , improve skin barrier function , improve appearance facial wrinkle post-menopausal woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Almonds Skin Lipids Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint : A ) Change wrinkle depth . Full facial photograph obtain baseline , 8 week , 16 week . The image obtain 3D Clarity ProÂ® Facial Modeling Analysis System ( Brigh-Tex BioPhotonics , San Jose , CA ) standardize position light . This system assess average wrinkle depth . The PI already validate measurement tool standard clinical grade facial wrinkle [ 13 ] . Secondary Endpoint : A ) Change clinical appearance facial wrinkle lateral canthus : Two blind dermatologist grade photograph obtain time point lateral canthus ( `` crow 's foot '' ) . The dermatologist know group subject . B ) Change facial sebum production use Sebumeter , commonly used device measure sebum excretion rate [ 13,17 ] . Sebum excretion rate measure baseline , 8 week , 16 week . C ) Change serum sebum lipid profile obtain use Sebutapes baseline , 8 week , 16 week . D ) Change serum sebum lipid profile assessment long chain/short chain fatty acid ratio NS ceramide content . Procedures Involved This study 16-week supplementation study utilize two study group : 1 ) Control group 2 ) Almond supplementation : 20 % energy intake . This randomized , rater-blinded , control study . There total 30 subject : Control Group : n=15 Almond Supplementation : n=15 The subject recruit UC Davis Dermatology Department , surround clinic 25 mile radius , general population Davis Sacramento area . The great Sacramento area population 2 million draw recruitment conduct use Social Media flyer base recruitment . We collect medical history current medication study participants- outlined HIPAA form . The two intervention group consist receive almond receive calorie match snack . The almond dose provide 20 % total energy ( 20 % E ) diet . This dose select base previous randomize trial examine lipid parameter response 0 , 10 % , 20 % E dietary almond recent meta-analysis intervention trial tree nut [ 23,24 ] . The control snack typical western diet snack . The calorie-matched control snack commercially available individually wrap food product small granola bar + pretzel . Once subject meet inclusion criterion sign IRB consent , anthropometric data obtain , 3-24 hour recall collect phone , skype , person Registered Dietitian , train provide record dietary record , estimate caloric need calculate . Estimated energy need ( EER ) determine use Mifflin-St. Jeor equation total daily energy need ( TDE ) calculate EER x activity factor 1.3-1.5 sedentary average activity , high activity level indicate . A representative example 60 year old woman , 5 ' 4 '' , 140 pound typical activity level yield TDE approximately 1,600 - 1,800 kcal/day , 20 % E 320-360 kcal/day . The dose almond would 2 ounce ( equal 23 whole kernel ) /day , provide 328 calorie .</detailed_description>
