	<brief_summary>This study patient advance non-small cell lung cancer change cancer cell call EGFR mutation . Mutated EGFR important growth cancer cell . Medical study show patient EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer gain benefit target therapy drug EGFR inhibitor standard chemotherapy . However , significant proportion patient carry sensitize mutation respond well first-generation EGFR-TKIs ( erlotinib gefitinib ) , indicate existence intrinsic resistance mechanism . Moreover , despite initial response EGFR-TKIs , acquire resistance inevitable patient . The investigator recently show Cripto-1 overexpression EGFR mutant NSCLC contribute intrinsic resistance EGFR-TKIs activation SRC oncogene . They also show combination EGFR-TKI ( erlotinib osimertinib ) Src inhibitor synergistic Cripto-1 overexpressing tumor laboratory . This study test combination two drug , dasatinib osimertinib , overcome resistance EGFR-TKIs . Osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) third-generation EGFR-TKI , selectively block activity EGFR mutant , spare wild type . The advantage use osimertinib inhibits sensitize EGFR mutation , also T790M mutant , common mechanism acquire resistance . Dasatinib potent , orally available ABL1/SRC TKI , approve treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) first-line patient imatinib-resistant disease intolerant , actively study patient advance solid tumor . The first part study involve find high dose dasatinib give osimertinib without cause severe side effect , find side effect see give dasatinib different dose level osimertinib , measure level dasatinib osimertinib blood different dose level . The second part determine effect combination dasatinib osimertinib determine amount Cripto-1 protein tumor blood make likely good response combination dasatinib osimertinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Osimertinib ( AZD9291 ) Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With EGFR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment patient advance non-small cell lung cancer unsatisfactory . The median survival approximately 12 month standard chemotherapy . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations one frequent genetic abnormality observe non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , especially adenocarcinoma subtype . The predominant EGFR mutation in-frame deletion exon-19 L858R missense mutation , patient carry mutation mostly sensitive EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) . However , significant proportion patient carry sensitize mutation respond well first generation EGFR-TKIs ( erlotinib gefitinib ) , indicate existence intrinsic resistance mechanism . Moreover , despite initial response EGFR-TKIs , acquire resistance inevitable patient . Novel treatment strategy need develop overcome resistance EGFR-TKIs . The investigator recently show Cripto-1 overexpression EGFR mutant NSCLC contribute intrinsic resistance EGFR-TKIs SRC activation . They also show combination EGFR-TKI ( erlotinib AZD9291 ) Src inhibitor synergistic vitro vivo Cripto-1 overexpressing tumor . AZD9291 third-generation EGFR-TKI , selectively block activity EGFR mutant spar wild type . The advantage use AZD9291 inhibit mutant exon-19 deletion L858R , also T790M mutant , common mechanism acquire resistance . Dasatinib potent , orally available ABL1/SRC TKI , approve treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) first-line patient imatinib-resistant disease intolerant , actively study patient advance solid tumor . This open-label , non-randomized , prospective phase I/II trial . The phase I portion follow standard 3+3 design phase I portion one-sample group sequential multiple test procedure phase II portion .</detailed_description>

Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient sufficiently recover yet . Untreated uncontrolled second tumor past 2 year . Logistical psychological hindrance participation clinical research . Patients untreated symptomatic brain metastasis may eligible symptom require urgent surgery radiation , steroid necessary . Patients evidence interstitial lung disease ( bilateral , diffuse , parenchymal lung disease ) . Pleural pericardial effusion grade study entry . Subjects previously diagnose pleural/pericardial effusion grade resolve time study entry allow . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . Women men want participate agree use two highly effective form contraceptive prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day follow completion therapy , eligible . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start study drug .
