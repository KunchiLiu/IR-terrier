	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine characteristic distinguish responder nonresponders people stroke receive rTMS combine physical therapy improve hand function . Investigators hypothesize improve characterize large evoked brain signal stroke hemisphere low score Beck Depression Inventory indicate less depression . Medications , sex , age , type stroke , location stroke , duration stroke baseline hand function also compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause long-term disability United States . The disability stem neuron kill stroke also neurons become dormant non-use reason . The killed neuron recover excitability dormant neuron improve . Increasing excitability make easy voluntary recruitment neuron patient , translates improve voluntary function quality life . Investigators use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) 10 year University Minnesota strictly research mode . Investigators find people benefit rTMS . Investigators also observe people prior study ask receive rTMS research participation conclude people willing pay service privately . However , recently , investigator able offer service . Investigators succeed get approval University Minnesota allow rTMS combined physical therapy give outpatient stroke physician referral . Patients receive initial block five rTMS/physical therapy ( rTMS/PT ) treatment nonstroke hemisphere , early sign benefit show , patient receive second block 5 additional treatment . If patient show improvement , alternative approach involve rTMS stroke hemisphere offer . Patients inform advance cost , insurance carrier cover cost , patient would pay privately treatment . The research component project involve collect hand function data along stroke characteristic conduct responder vs. nonresponder analysis . In way , investigator would provide clinical service patient desire treatment learn characteristic benefit , would guide future treatment decision .</detailed_description>
