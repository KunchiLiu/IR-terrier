	<brief_title>The Comparative Efficacy Zio Patch v Implantable Loop Recorder Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia , increase prevalence age characterize chaotic contraction atrium . An estimated 2.2 million people United States 4.5 million European Union AF . [ 1,2 ] AF associate heart failure , hemodynamic impairment , symptom affect quality life . Patients increase risk thromboembolic event , include stroke , result significant morbidity , mortality , cost . [ 1-5 ] Diagnosis atrial fibrillation make via electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record . Any arrhythmia ECG characteristic AF last sufficiently long 12-lead ECG record , least 30 second rhythm strip , consider AF episode . [ 6 ] The diagnosis require ECG rhythm strip demonstrating : 1 ) `` absolutely '' irregular RR interval ( absence complete AV block ) , 2 ) Absence distinct P wave surface ECG , 3 ) atrial cycle length ( visible ) usually variable less 200 msec . [ 7 ] During past decade , catheter ablation atrial fibrillation ( AF ) evolve rapidly investigational procedure current status commonly perform ablation procedure many major hospital throughout world . The goal ablation isolate pulmonary vein majority population atrial fibrillation originates . During past several year large number meta analysis perform hope well define efficacy AF ablation . Overall , success rate 77.8 % ablation arm compare 23.3 % control group . Catheter ablation decrease recurrence AF 71 % ( relative risk 0.29 ) . Several meta analysis randomize clinical trial confirm finding [ 8-12 ] . Background Significance Arrhythmia monitoring patient undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation challenge . Trans-telephonic monitor ( TTMs ) cumbersome use provide limit , temporal assessment . Implantable loop recorder may overcome limitation . The ABACUS study seek evaluate utility implantable loop recorder ( ILRs ) versus conventional monitoring ( CM ) patient undergo AF ablation . In AF ablation patient , ILR detect arrhythmias CM . However , false detection remain challenge include inability ILR detect atrial fibrillation le 2 minute duration . The investigator conclude adequate oversight , ILRs may useful monitoring patient ablation . [ 13 ] ILR 's convenient patient due fact require electrodes patch . In addition external monitor must accompany electrode adhesive pair . Despite convenience ILR respect everyday life , offset diagnostic sensitivity give inherent algorithm limit fast time detection 2 minute . Current Heart Rhythm Consensus 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement Catheter Surgical Ablation Atrial Fibrillation : Recommendations Patient Selection , Procedural Techniques , Patient Management Follow-up , Definitions , Endpoints , Research Trial DesignS consensus demonstrate 30 second deem clinically acceptable duration atrial fibrillation . Despite advance technology patient frequently experience recurrence atrial fibrillation either cardioversion post atrial fibrillation ablation . Implantable loop recorder emerge technology require surgical procedure potentially record continuous rhythm battery life usually last approximately three year . The procedure also lead explantation secondary erosion migration . Some cardiologist electrophysiologists use ILR post ablation AF surveillance . This affords long term surveillance , however device costly risk infection well . Novel technology term LTCM capability record store continuous ECG 14 day . Novel technology available term ambulatory long term continuous monitor ( LTCM ) one include Zio XT capability record store continuous ECG 14 day . Long Term Cardiac Telemetry provide beat-to-beat ECG recording , storage analysis automatic arrhythmia detection . The ZIO XT device utilizes adhesive patch attache conveniently patient . The LTCM capability detect AF duration le 2 minute compare ILR . The patch disposable may wear 14 day duration . . The Zio patch They contain proprietary algorithm detect number different arrhythmia include limited non-sustained ventricular tachycardia , brady- arrhythmia include heart block well life threaten polymorphic ventricular tachycardia . LTCMs substantially cost effective may use clinic emergency department . The LTCMs however study comparative effectiveness trial implantable loop recorder . Each patient already implantable loop recorder receive Zio patch experimental arm trial . The primary endpoint investigation compare LTCM 's verse implantable loop recorder successful detection recurrence atrial fibrillation pulmonary vein isolation . We hypothesize LTCM 's detect atrial fibrillation pulmonary vein isolation accurately implantable loop recorder . Secondary objective comparison follow : 1 . Agreement assessment event two device . 2 . Sensitivity , Specificity , PPV , Accuracy Reliability two device ( LTCM vs. ILR ) compare ECG readout . That , ECG LCTM use gold standard ass LCTM event ECG ILR use assess ILR event . Summary statistic two event presented side side . 3 . Successful symptom rhythm correlation judge use patient activator patch 4 . Signal Quality Voltage ILR vs. LTCM 5 . Rate False Detection ILR vs. LTCM 6 . Quality Monitoring Experience Survey patient 7 . Cost Benefit Analysis 7 . Economic outcomes 8 . Arrhythmia AF detect Research Plan Inclusion Criterion 1 . Patients diagnosis paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation document electrocardiography 2 . Patients must already Medtronic LINQ ILR standard care already implant standard care 3 . Patients must available least 7 maximum 14 day patch application 4 . Patients must great equal 18 year old . Exclusion Criterion Patients le 18 year age 1 . Patients history permanent atrial fibrillation 2 . Patients implanted pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator 3 . CPatients cognitive delay dementia 4 . UPatients unable give Consent . 5 . Patients adhesive allergy Research Design The study perform University Florida Health Science Center UF Health , Jacksonville-Division Cardiology . Patients recruit Cardiology Clinics institution screen Cardiology Research Staff , verify candidate meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients find eligible study already undergone implantable loop recorder ( ILR ) ( Medtronic LINQ , Minneapolis , MN ) implant . After provide write informed consent , subject pair LTCM - ZIOÂ® Patch , iRhythm Technologies , Inc. San Francisco , CA ) . Both ILR ZIO Patch set Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) . Subjects instruct wear ZIO Patch minimum 7 day exceed 14 day . To help ensure compliance study follow phone call make day 7 ( +/- 1 day ) . Subjects return UF Shands -Jacksonville day 12 ( +/- 2 day ) removal patch data download ILR . Quality Monitoring Questionnaire provide . To avoid reporting bias raw data ZIO Patch , raw data event recording ( ECG analysis ) review adjudication committee two three board certify cardiologist . If disagreement , third physician decide . At final study visit ( outline METHODS ) patch ship iRhythm .</detailed_description>
