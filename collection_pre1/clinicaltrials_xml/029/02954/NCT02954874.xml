	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) patient triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) either &gt; = 1 cm residual invasive breast cancer and/or positive lymph node ( &gt; ypN+ ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy randomize receive 1 year MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) adjuvant therapy compare MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) , entire study population also PD-L1 positive subset . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare effect MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) overall survival ( OS ) distant recurrence-free survival ( DRFS ) two randomized arm PD-L1 positive patient patient . II . To assess toxicity tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) patient population without radiation therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine association biomarkers inflammation quality life patient report outcomes two group end therapy . II . To examine long-term late effect treatment patient-reported outcome . III . To collect tissue whole blood processing banking anticipation future correlative study patient population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( OBSERVATION ) : Patients receive treatment monitor standard clinical interval first year randomization . Patients examine every 12 week 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually 5 year . ARM II ( PEMROLIZUMAB ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 22 . Courses repeat every 42 day 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient may undergo radiation therapy within 12 week last breast cancer operation treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STEP 1 REGISTRATION Patients must histologically confirm estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) HER2negative ( triplenegative , TNBC ) residual invasive breast cancer , define 2010 2013 American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) College American Pathologists ( CAP ) guideline , completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy ; residual disease must &gt; = 1 cm great dimension , and/or positive lymph node ( ypN+ ) observe pathologic exam NOTE : Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) positive isolated tumor cell lymph node ( N0 [ i+ ] ) consider nodepositive patient also must &gt; = 1 cm residual invasive cancer breast order eligible Patients must metastatic disease ( i.e. , must M0 ) It prefer axillary lymph node sample perform completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow accurate assessment pathologic response ; patient must complete axillary lymph node dissection neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow situation ( exception grant patient participate Alliance A11202 trial ) : Patients document pathologic involvement axillary node ( fine needle aspiration [ FNA ] core biopsy ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy sentinel node biopsy neoadjuvant chemotherapy positive sentinel node ( ) Patient document pathologic involvement axillary node ( FNA core biopsy ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 sentinel lymph node remove neoadjuvant chemotherapy NOTE : Patients undergo sentinel node biopsy start neoadjuvant treatment undergo post neoadjuvant assessment axillary node negative axillary node post neoadjuvant assessment must &gt; = 1 cm residual invasive cancer breast completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy Patients must minimum five , available unstained slide residual ( postneoadjuvant ) invasive tumor primary site lymph node submit within 7 day registration determine PDL1 expression ; tumor tissue must adequate PDL1 test , typically require minimum 100 cancer cell per slide Patients must offer opportunity participate specimen bank Patients must neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery ; recommend neoadjuvant treatment include 1624 week third generation chemotherapy regimen recommend National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline triple negative breast cancer ( example include dose dense adriamycincytoxan [ AC ] follow dosedense paclitaxel ; weekly paclitaxel x 12 follow precede cyclophosphamideadriamycinfluorouracil [ FAC ] , fluorouracilepirubicincytoxan [ FEC ] , AC dose dense AC ; docetaxel either follow precede FEC/FAC AC ; carboplatincontaining neoadjuvant chemotherapy also allow ) ; patient complete plan treatment cycle reason consider high risk therefore eligible study residual disease ; patient must resolution adverse event ( ) recent prior chemotherapy grade 1 less , except alopecia = &lt; grade 2 neuropathy allow Patients may receive postoperative ( adjuvant ) chemotherapy 24 week duration ( e.g . 8 cycle capecitabine CREATEX trial ) completion surgery discretion treat physician ; patient must resolution adverse event ( ) recent prior chemotherapy grade 1 less , except alopecia = &lt; grade 2 neuropathy allow ; adjuvant chemotherapy , administer , must complete within 35 day prior screen registration must give prior radiation Patients must complete final breast surgery ( render free disease ) clear resection margin invasive cancer ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) within 90 day prior screen registration patient receive postoperative ( adjuvant ) chemotherapy , within 210 day prior screen registration patient complete postoperative ( adjuvant ) chemotherapy ; positive margin allow surgical team patient deem resection impossible Patients radiation therapy ( RT ) affect breast chest wall regional nodal area clinically indicate per NCCN treatment guideline , receive RT randomization possible , concomitant MK3475 ( pembrolizumab ) randomize experimental arm ; however , RT administer prior registration also allow ; patient must specify time screen registration whether receive RT extent intend RT Patients must prior immunotherapy antiPDL1 , antiPD1 , antiCTLA4 similar drug ; patient must plan receive prohibit therapy screen treatment phase study Patients must plan receive concomitantly biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , surgery anticancer therapy except radiation therapy receive treatment protocol Patients must Zubrod performance status = &lt; 2 Patients must history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid evidence active pneumonitis Patients must active infection require systemic therapy Patients must active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) ; replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment Patients must receive live vaccine within 30 day prior registration ; example live vaccine include , limited , follow : measles , mumps , rubella , chicken pox , shingle , yellow fever , rabies , Bacillus CalmetteGuerin ( BCG ) , typhoid ( oral ) vaccine ; seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally kill virus vaccine allow ; however , intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist ) live attenuate vaccine , allow Patients must know active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection prior registration ; patient complete curative therapy HCV eligible ; patient know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection eligible meet follow 3 criterion : CD4 count &gt; = 350 mm^3 Serum HIV viral load &lt; 25,000 IU/ml Treated stable antiretroviral regimen No prior invasive malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal ( squamous cell ) skin cancer , situ breast cervical cancer ; stage I II invasive cancer treat curative intent without evidence disease recurrence least five year Patients must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent protocol accordance institutional federal guideline As part Oncology Patient Enrollment Network ( OPEN ) registration process treat institution 's identity provide order ensure current ( within 365 day ) date institutional review board approval study enter system STEP 2 REGISTRATION Patients must register step 2 receive confirmation Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) Statistical Center patient 's tissue specimen adequate PDL1 testing ;
