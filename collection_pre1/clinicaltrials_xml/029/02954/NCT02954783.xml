	<brief_summary>Background purpose : The purpose study investigate effect exercise intratumoral natural killer ( NK ) -cell variability patient localized prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy . The primary hypothesis exercise induce epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural killer ( NK ) -cell infiltration patient localized prostate cancer , infiltration great patient perform High Intensity Interval Training compare moderate intensity training . Currently lack randomize controlled trial examine different type exercise patient localized prostate cancer . Moreover need study include biological measurement allow full assessment effect exercise diverse biomarkers mechanistic pathway , may influence cancer survival . Subjects : Patients histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma schedule radical prostatectomy Urologic Department , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen , Denmark . Methods : In randomize control pilot study 30 patient localized prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy include randomize either High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT ) exercise intervention , Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise Resistance Training ( MI-AT+RT ) intervention ( standard recommendation ) observational control receive usual care total period 8 week . All patient undergo assessment inclusion ( baseline ) 8 week ( 5-7 day prior surgery , ) respectively . Assessments include : anthropometrics ; blood pressure ; rest hearth rate ; cardiorespiratory fitness cardiopulmonary exercise test ( VO2 peak . ) ; body composition DXA scan ; quality life self-report questionnaire ; oral glucose tolerance test ; fast blood sample measure cholesterol , triglyceride , insulin , c-peptide , HbA1c , glucose , hormone inflammatory marker . Also , investigator collect blood sample , acute exercise bout order explore acute systemic change exercise-regulated biomarkers . Biological tissue tumor ( primary prostate biopsy ) retrieve respective local pathological department perioperative prostate specimen send protocol analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect exercise variability intratumoral Natural Killer ( NK ) -cell infiltration tumor biopsy take exercise intervention patient randomize one three study arm : I ) High Intensity Interval Training ( N=10 ) II ) Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Resistance Training ( N=10 ) III ) usual care , prior radical prostatectomy ( N=10 ) . In addition investigator wish investigate effect different exercise regimens tumor vessel morphology , modulation tumor-metabolism , -biology signal . Furthermore aim explore acute response immune cell , hormone cytokine blood sample take , single exercise session patient two exercise intervention arm . Finally aim explore effect different pre-operative exercise regimens physiological ( e.g . cardiovascular fitness , body composition , metabolic profile metabolic inflammatory marker ) psycho-social ( e.g . fatigue , emotional well-being , anxiety ) endpoint relative usual care .</detailed_description>
