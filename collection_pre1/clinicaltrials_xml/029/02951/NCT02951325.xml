	<brief_title>Bladder Cancer Adjuvant Radiotherapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment detail : Surgery ( Standard/routine care ) All patient would undergo radical surgery form cysto-prostatectomy pelvic nodal dissection part standard care . Patients would also urinary diversion ( Ileostomy ) continent neo bladder . Chemotherapy All patient follow cysto-prostatectomy receive upto 4 cycle adjuvant chemotherapy medically fit . Those patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy , receive additional chemotherapy cycle surgery total 4 cycle find suitable . The chemotherapy regimen , dos schedule per standard institutional practice use Platinum base chemotherapy . No concomitant chemotherapy radiotherapy recommend . Radiation therapy : All patient treat conformal radiotherapy technique intensity modulate radiotherapy without image guidance . The radiotherapy start within maximum 8 week date surgery adjuvant chemotherapy plan . If adjuvant chemo plan patient receive radiotherapy within 4 week last chemo cycle . Dose Prescription : 50.4Gray ( Gy ) 28fractions ( 1.8Gy/ # ) prescribe nodal PTV . In case R1 and/or R2 resection dose pelvic node tumour bed may increase 54-56Gy 28 fraction depend constraint achieve planning . Clinical assessment : 1 . Toxicity assess 1 . Weekly physician assessment RT score toxicity . 2 . RTOG toxicity criterion baseline , 6-8 week post RT 3 monthly thereafter 2 year 6 monthly thereafter 5 year . 3 . QOL assess baseline 3-6 monthly thereafter 2 . Disease evaluation The first follow patient do 6-8 week ass toxicity . Clinical evaluation disease do follow visit clinical examination . CT scan abdomen pelvis do 6 monthly second visit onwards 2 year 12 monthly thereafter whenever clinically indicate decide physician .</detailed_description>
