	<brief_title>The Effects Metformin Self-selected Exercise Intensity , Physical Fitness Exercise-induced AMPK-activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity first line treatment patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , however , vast majority patient T2D achieve satisfy glycemic control physical activity alone , pharmacological treatment metformin often initiate . It known metformin exercise activate AMPK , result many different metabolic effect . Because similarity , interaction metformin exercise plausible , knowledge area sparse . With study investigator aim look individual combined effect metformin exercise order investigate whether interaction occur . An Interaction tremendous clinical importance patient T2D give current guideline vast majority patient recommend exercise metformin treatment . The investigator hypothesize metformin treatment reduces self-selected exercise intensity , may explain via decreased mitochondrial complex 1 function , increase blood lactate level , heart rate RPE exercise . Furthermore exercise-induced AMPK-activation reduce metformin treatment .</detailed_description>
