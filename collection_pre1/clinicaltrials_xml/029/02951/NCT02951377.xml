	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : The primary aim study test feasibility Mechanical Diagnosis Treatment ( MDT ) +/- transforaminal epidural steroid injection ( TESI ) pain disability patient await surgical consult lumbar radiculopathy secondary lumbar disc herniation , compare usual care within current healthcare system Calgary , Alberta , Canada . Hypothesis : investigator hypothesise centralisers treat MDT non-centralisers receive TESIs + MDT demonstrate reduction self-reported pain disability , compare usual care control . Aim 2 : investigator also describe potential impact healthcare resource track surgical rate self-reported healthcare utilisation study period . Hypothesis : base predict reduction pain disability , investigator hypothesise trend toward overall less healthcare utilisation ( include surgery ) MDT guide group compare surgical wait list group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose Specific Objectives : This pilot study aim determine feasibility conduct definitive clinical trial MDT +/- TESI patient await surgical consult lumbar radiculopathy secondary lumbar disc herniation compare usual care . Research Design Methodology : Design participant : Randomised clinical trial pilot study . Eligible candidate identify surgeon Foothills Hospital Calgary . The investigator recruit 30 patient ( 15 per group ) . Fifteen - twenty subject per group provide reasonable bias-corrected estimate medium effect . Inclusion criterion : Leg dominant pain secondary lumbar disc protrusion confirm MRI duration &gt; 3 month , least one neurological sign able speak English provide write informed consent . Exclusion criterion : pregnancy specific cause low back pain ( LBP ) directly relate herniated disc , progressive neurological sign and/or cauda equine syndrome , contraindication use corticosteroid fluoroscopy . Consecutive patient randomise either intervention describe enable estimation magnitude treatment effect usual care follow estimate magnitude effect control group . Interventions : Group 1- Control group : Outcome assessment conduct patient wait list surgical consultation baseline , 6 week , 3 month . Group 2 - Intervention group ( MDT group ) : Consistent MDT approach , patient initially assess centralisation 2 visit Credentialed MDT therapist classify centraliser ( group 2a ) non-centralising pain response ( group 2b ) . A centralise pain response define whose distal pain reduce retreat toward mid-line ( e.g. , pain knee ) response certain posture repeat end-range movement test . Group 2a , Centralisers : Patients centralise pain response continue treatment base MDT principle complete exercise diary indicate frequency exercise perform daily . Group 2b , Non-centralisers : Patients non-centralising pain response offer TESIs follow MDT . TESIs 20mg dexamethasone 0.5cc lidocaine 2 % , fluoroscopic guidance contrast medium ( Omni Pac 240 ) describe Spine Intervention Society ( SIS ) guideline provide . Segment level determine base MRI finding combination clinical examination finding . Two week completion MDT TESI intervention , patient reassess treated manner consistent present pain response classification : 1 ) resolve : advice remain active ; 2 ) centralising : treat accord MDT principle direction specific exercise postural advise ; 3 ) non-centralising significant less pain : advice remain active , respect worsen leg pain ; 4 ) persist high level pain and/or disability : advise remain active tolerate consult family physician . Those continue perform MDT exercise complete exercise diary indicate frequency exercise perform daily Outcome assessment : Assessing treat therapist credentialed MDT blind outcomes . The following outcome assess group baseline , 6 week , 3 month . The primary outcome measure Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) adapt validated sciatica , leg pain intensity , global perceive effect ( GPE ) . Average leg pain intensity measure use numeric rating scale range 0 ( pain ) 10 ( worst imaginable pain ) past 24 hour . GPE measure use 7 point Likert scale , low score suggest recovery high score suggest worsen . Secondary outcome measure include fear avoidance ( FABQ ) , general health ( SF-12 ) , medication use . Demographics also collect . In addition , participant prescribe exercise complete diary indicating frequency exercise perform . Data analysis : Leg pain intensity 3 month , measure use 10 point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) primary outcome large definitive study plan . An independent t-test use estimate effect size intervention group compare control group . Independent t-tests also apply outcome measure exploratory purpose . Statistical significance set Î±=0.05 . Descriptive statistic calculate .</detailed_description>
