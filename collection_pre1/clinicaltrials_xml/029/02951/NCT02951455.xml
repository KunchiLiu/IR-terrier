	<detailed_description>The current project seek implement Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) Community Based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) principles identify efficient , scalable , sustainable combination Community Wise component . Community Wise manualized multi-level intervention aim reduce health inequality relate alcohol illicit drug use ( AIDU ) . The research conduct Newark Community Collaborative Board ( NCCB ) , network develop pilot-tested original Community Wise . NCCB member include principal investigator ( PIs ) , co-investigators ( Co-Is ) , service provider , consumer AIDU , community member . Specific aim include : Aim 1 : Use highly efficient experimental design estimate unique contribution key component Community Wise : ) reduce AIDU frequency b ) increase percentage participant abstinent five month . Components test presence absence : ( ) Critical Dialogue ; ( b ) Quality-of-Life-Wheel ; ( c ) Capacity Building Project ; ( ) group facilitation peer versus license clinician . A factorial experiment use detect effect individual component three-way interaction . Aim 2 : Informed MOST , Community Wise optimize scalability sustainability -- efficacious combination component deliver less $ 2000 per intervention cycle serve eleven individual simultaneously ( per recommendation Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) . This 2x2x2x2 factorial design fully powered detect change AIDU sample 528 men substance use disorder history incarceration reside distressed community predominantly Black population . Participants randomly assign one sixteen experimental condition . The first eight condition facilitate licensed facilitator . The remain condition facilitate peer facilitator . Each set eight condition include follow component : ( 1 ) Critical Dialogue ( CD ) ; ( 2 ) Quality-of-Life-Wheel ( QLW ) ; ( 3 ) Capacity Building Project ( CBP ) ; ( 4 ) CD+QLW ; ( 5 ) CD+CBP ; ( 6 ) QLW+CBP ; ( 7 ) CD+QLW+CBP ; ( 8 ) component . Data collect baseline plus five post-baseline monthly follow-up . This study potential impact public health ; use CBPR MOST generate action-oriented implication optimize multi-level intervention adaptable address different health inequality .</detailed_description>
