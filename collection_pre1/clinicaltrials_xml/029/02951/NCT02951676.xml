	<detailed_description>Hypothesis A course amoxicillin ( 250 mg , three time daily five day ) , routinely prescribed part treatment protocol third molar extraction cause significant shift stable oral microbiome . The primary outcome measure ass : 1 . Relative abundance different bacteria 5 specified time point assess 16 r DNA gene sequence oral microbiome . 2 . Relative abundance expression know antibiotic resistance gene assess microarray know resistant gene functional metagenomics . Secondary outcome measure ass : 1 . Presence inflammation oral cavity measuring level C- reactive protein saliva 2 time point . 2 . Clinical sign symptom first week treatment monitor presence inflammation infection . Subjects schedule routine surgical extraction give write consent part study recruit . An experienced clinical operator specialist maxillofacial surgery training ( ML Co-A ) responsible perform clinical treatment . Prescription antibiotic base case complexity , difficulty operative surgical procedure time take . Therefore patient randomize base obtain 15 patient group . This intervention study risk group patient receive expect standard care . Saliva collect seven observational time point ( Baseline , one week , two week , three week , one month , three month six month ) Supragingival plaque sample collect four observational time point ( Baseline , one week , one month , three month ) . A control group 15 subject undergo dental extraction antibiotic treatment recruit obtain inform consent follow seven time point . The subject ask refrain brushing teeth night sample collection perform similarly ask use dental mouthwash . Apart collection time point , subject ask maintain 'normal ' , routine oral hygiene procedure duration study . Seven Time Points collection saliva sample : Baseline 1. week 2. week 3. week 1 month 3 month 6 month Three Time Points collection plaque sample : Baseline 1 week 1 month 3 month After collection baseline sample surgical extraction third molar tooth perform . The subject give post extraction instruction analgesic pain relief subject amoxicillin require antibiotic . Compliance check ask patient check tablet wrapper strip amoxicillin recall appointment . The subject ask refrain use mouth rinse one month study period ( already ) toothpaste without antibacterial content provide use . Each subject undergo baseline periodontal examination , include measurement probe depth , clinical attachment loss , gingival index , plaque index , gingival irritation oral health status record . Samples DNA extraction collect specified time point describe . Samples take morning least two hour meal Collection plaque saliva sample do describe Keijser et al ( 13 ) .Samples take morning 5 ml saliva collect use cryovials ( Salimetrics ) ask subject passively drool saliva device . Samples place ice immediately store -800C . A sterile microbrush use collect Supragingival plaque sample buccal dental surface . After sample collection , tip brush cut store inside Eppendorf tube -800C The Supragingival plaque collection do six teeth ( 16 , 11,24,41,36 , 44 ) . Saliva sample vortexed two set 0.3 ml volumes transfer two sterile two cap Eppendorf tube 0.3 g zirconia silica bead . 50 microliter saliva use measurement C - reactive protein level baseline one week use C- Reactive Protein ELISA kit ( Salimetrics ) . The sample homogenize add 0.2 ml phenol use mini bead beater 2 minute . DNA extract use DNA extraction kit ( Qiagen ) . Amplification 16 r RNA hyper variable region V4 , do use primer sequence perform use MiSeq platform . Microarray resistant gene functional metagenomics perform described Card et al ( 14 ) . Treatment Subjects This prospective , longitudinal , observational , cohort study investigate young adult undergoing surgical extraction wisdom tooth without antibiotic post-operatively . Antibiotics analgesic give post- operatively . Amoxicillin Intra orally , three time daily 250 mg 5 day Analgesics - Arcoxia 120mg three day Paracetamol 500 mg QID PRN 3 day Paracetamol 1 g Plus 16 mg Codeine Phosphate . The prescription antibiotic base clinical judgment base case complexity , trauma length procedure . No randomization perform . Saliva collect five observational time point ( Baseline , one week , two week , three week one month ) Supragingival plaque sample collect three observational time point ( Baseline , one week one month ) .Compliance check ask patient check tablet wrapper strip amoxicillin recall appointment . Assessment Efficacy The study look efficacy new drug . The treatment procedure carry accord conventional treatment protocol . Assessment Safety The study look safety new drug . The treatment procedure carry accord conventional treatment protocol . Statistical analysis . Barcoded amplicon library small subunit ribosomal RNA gene V4 hyper variable region generate sample use V4 forward primer GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA V4 reverse primer GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT describe Schloss http : //www.mothur.org/wiki/File : Wet-lab_MiSeq_SOP.pdf . The amplicon library pool equimolar amount sequence mean Illumina MiSeq system . The sequence data process use combination QIIME ( 15 ) UPARSE ( 16 ) pipeline . After quality filtering , read cluster Operational Taxonomic Units ( OTUs ) minimal sequence similarity 97 % use UPARSE . The representative sequence cluster assign taxonomy use Ribosomal Database Project ( RDP ) classifier 80 % confidence QIIME . To normalize difference sequence depth , read randomly subsampled equal number reads/sample . Data reduction principal component analysis ( PCA ) log2 transform OTU data diversity statistic ( Shannon Diversity Index ) , Bray-Curtis Similarity Index , one-way permutational multivariate analysis variance ( PERMANOVA ) similarity percentage ( SIMPER ) perform use PAST software ( 17 ) . PCA use visualize potential microbiome cluster treatment visit . Shannon Diversity index take account number taxon ( OTUs ) relative contribution OTU whole dataset . Bray-Curtis Similarity Index bind 0 1 , 1 mean two sample composition 0 mean two sample share specie . This index apply assess similarity microbiomes visit 1 ( baseline sample ) visit individual . This method allow quantify microbial shift time . Independent sample T-test use compare microbiome shift two treatment group . PERMANOVA use assess microbiome profile differ statistically significantly two treatment group . SIMPER use identify OTUs contribute difference treatment group . Microbiome analysis output : Per sample type ( plaque , saliva ) time point include OTU-table normalized read count per sample respective taxonomical assignment OTU ; Shannon Diversity Index per individual sample statistical analysis mention . Cluster analysis use weighted UniFrac metric use analyze relative abundance bacteria different time point .
