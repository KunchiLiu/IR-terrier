	<brief_summary>The Antiretroviral Therapy Long Acting Suppression ( ATLAS ) study conduct establish human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) infect adult participant current viral suppression regimen 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus third agent , remain suppressed upon switch two-drug intramuscular ( IM ) long-acting ( LA ) regimen cabotegravir ( CAB ) rilpivirine ( RPV ) . This Phase 3 , multi-phase , randomize , open label , active-controlled , multicenter , parallel-group , non-inferiority study HIV-1 , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) -adult participant stably suppress current antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimen . This study design demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity switch two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 week ( Q4W : monthly ) compare maintenance current ARV regimen contain 2 NRTIs plus INI , NNRTI , PI . Eligible participant randomize ( 1:1 ) Maintenance Phase Day 1 either continue current ART switch initiate oral therapy CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg daily 4 Weeks follow Q4 weekly ( monthly ) CAB LA + RPV LA injection . Following Maintenance phase Week 52 , participant randomize continue current ART regimen give option switch CAB LA + RPV LA injection . Those participant would transition LA dosing , begin 4 week oral CAB + RPV therapy Week 52 , receive first IM CAB LA + RPV LA injection Week 56 .</brief_summary>
