	<brief_summary>Background Treatment clavicular non- malunion still challenge . Current surgical procedure often result partially frustrating functional outcome along high-grade subjective impairment increase rate revision surgery . However , combination vital bone graft biomechanically sufficient fixation system seem promise concept treatment . Methods In retrospective study , 14 patient mean age 44 year ( 26-67 year ) suffer non-union ( n=11 ) and/or malunion ( n=4 ) clavicle enrol . All patient surgically treat use anatomical precontoured lock compression plate ( LCP ) autologous iliac crest bone graft . Functional outcome assess use age- sex-specific relative Constant Score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Patients follow-up All patient treat clavicular non- malunion lock compression plate iliac crest bone graft January 2010 December 2014 include retrospective study . The study protocol approve local ethic committee ( 71/15 S ) . The preoperative symptom include pain ( n=12 ) , limited range motion ( n=2 ) , pain sleep affected side ( n=2 ) , skin irritation cause dislocated screw ( n=1 ) , feel weakness arm ( n=1 ) crepitation ( n=1 ) . Standard radiograph affect clavicle ( anterior-posterior path ray perpendicular radiographic cassette , anterior-posterior path ray 30째 tilted cephalad ) perform time initial presentation patient well routine follow-up examination outpatient clinic . Preoperative planning include performance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan estimate non-vital part bone resect well performance compute tomography ( CT ) scan clavicle measure original clavicle length able adequately decide bone graft would require . A tricortical iliac crest bone graft use case bony defect large 15 mm due risk abnormal shoulder biomechanics follow clavicular shorten possibly result pain , shoulder motion impairment loss strength . The Constant Score use assess shoulder function activity preoperatively well routine follow-up examination outpatient clinic . Subsequently original Constant Score value convert accord Gerber et al . receive normative age- sex-specific Constant Score ( relative Constant Score ) . The implant The LCP ( lock compression plate ) superior anterior clavicle plate lateral extension ( Depuy ) anatomically precontoured fixation system three eight medial shaft hole 3.5 mm lock 3.5 mm cortex screw six lateral 2.7 mm divergent lock 2.4 mm cortex screw . This implant use treatment enrol patient . Surgical technique rehabilitation All patient underwent surgery place beachchair position affect arm mobile position . A longitudinal skin incision set clavicle subsequent incision clavi-pectoral fascia also longitudinal direction allow later closure ensure sufficient soft tissue coverage . After exposure non- malunion complex multidimensional osteotomy clavicle medial lateral axial correction vital bone perform . Vital bone verify local blood extravasation result drill previously osteotomized bone segment . The tricortical iliac crest bone graft harvest accord size assess preoperative CT scan , consecutively adapt intraoperative measure size bony defect . After implantation bone graft LCP center onto clavicular shaft . At least three screw place medially laterally bone graft ensure sufficient biomechanical stability . Before drill screw hole plate position control fluoroscopy . If necessary iliac crest bone graft additionally fix suture cerclage ( Fiber- Wire , Arthrex ) . After final radiographical examination wound close layer layer . Regarding postoperative rehabilitation primarily affect arm immobilized sling 6 week . Patients start physiotherapy first postoperative day follow standard rehabilitation protocol : abduction flexion restrict 30째 first two week , 60째 week three four postoperative 90째 week five six postoperative . Full weight bear allow week 12 postoperative . 3 , 6 , 12 24 week postoperatively radiographs perform evaluate bone healing .</detailed_description>
