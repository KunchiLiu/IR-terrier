	<detailed_description>Purpose : This randomized clinical trial test novel bristle-less tooth brush design effective preventing gingival recession adult receive periodontal maintenance soft tooth brush nylon bristle . Materials method : The investigator recruit 23 subject gingival recession receive regular periodontal maintenance care Western University Health Sciences Dental Center , exhibit sign acute dental systemic disease , occlusal discrepancy parafunctional habit . The investigator randomly assign subject two group , one use soft nylon-bristled tooth brush , group use experimental tooth brush contain brush head short , soft , rubbery cone . Both group receive regular maintenance periodontal exam blind examiner every 3-4 month measure probe depth , bleed probing , plaque index , gingival recession . In addition , gingival recession also determine use measure guide study model obtain polyvinylsiloxane impression . For added control confound variable , group supply abrasivity tooth paste waxed floss receiving repeat oral hygiene instruction phone follow-up .</detailed_description>
