	<brief_summary>The study assess safety ability several dos orally inhaled medicine [ ie , Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS ] improve airflow lung deliver electronic eFlow nebulizer system patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The study conduct 12 patient 2 part . Part 1 design find once-a- day GIS dose produce high improvement lung airflow . Part 2 tested GIS dose high improvement lung airflow placebo ( ie , drug ) deliver general purpose nebulizer . The airflow improvement GIS dose compare two nebulizer system determine effect device GIS delivery .</brief_summary>
