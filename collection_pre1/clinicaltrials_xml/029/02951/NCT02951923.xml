	<brief_summary>Bovine colostrum milk produce cow immediately calve . It contain high level protein improve immune protection may act prevent cold . During intense training , athlete often compromise immune function . This may especially true club-level rugby player abruptly start high intensity training spring preparation competitive season . Our study ass effect supplement player bovine colostrum intense training . Thirty-six player recruit ; half consume colostrum 8 week early-season train half soy protein . The investigator predict bovine colostrum supplement improve health training increase fitness level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect 8-weeks Bovine Colostrum Soy Protein Supplementation Rugby Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bovine colostrum first milk secrete cow calve . Colostrum high protein contain number bioactive substance include growth antimicrobial factor . Antimicrobial factor bovine colostrum include immunoglobulin variety less specific antimicrobial protein peptide . Immunoglobulin antimicrobial important immune system function . This important athlete intense exercise training compromise immune system ; therefore bovine colostrum potential improve exercise performance prevent immune system dysfunction common period heavy exercise training . Preliminary study colostrum supplementation show potential increase human exercise performance . The mechanism colostrum act benefit performance remain unclear . Similarly , study require elucidate colostrum-induced effect individual different age levels/intensity physical activity . The main growth factor bovine colostrum insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) . Bovine colostrum supplementation young individual increase IGF-1 level . Insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates growth muscle tissue important maintain muscle mass function adult . Bovine colostrum supplementation show increase lean tissue ( muscle mass ) young individual . Eight 12 week bovine colostrum supplementation resistance train program increase lean tissue mass 1.5 2 kg compare increase 0 1.2 kg whey protein supplementation . We also recently show bovine colostrum supplementation increase muscular strength compare similar amount supplementation whey protein men woman 50y . Examining effect colostrum rugby player present unique scientific opportunity nature training regime . Rugby player ' early season workout stressful training session season ( winter break must condition quickly start season pre-season game workout involve repeat sprint activity addition weight training ) . Rugby player would susceptible overtraining immune system depression time year . Bovine colostrum high level anti-microbials bioactive factor may beneficial mitigate deleterious effect early , high intensity training . The objective propose internship study determine effect 8 week bovine colostrum supplementation , compare soy protein supplementation rugby player early season training .</detailed_description>
