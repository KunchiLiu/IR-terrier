	<brief_summary>This phase II , single-arm study design evaluate effect atezolizumab treatment participant locally advance metastatic urothelial bladder cancer . Participants enrol 1 2 cohort . Cohort 1 ( report ) consist participant treatment-na√Øve ineligible cisplatin-containing chemotherapy . Cohort 2 contain participant progress follow prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen . The result second cohort report separately ( NCT02108652 ) . Participants cohort give 1200 milligram ( mg ) intravenous ( IV ) dose atezolizumab Day 1 21-day cycle . Treatment participant Cohort 1 continue disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors Version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1 ) unmanageable toxicity . Treatment participant Cohort 2 continue loss clinical benefit unmanageable toxicity .</brief_summary>
