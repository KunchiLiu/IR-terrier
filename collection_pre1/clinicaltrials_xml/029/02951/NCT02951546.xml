	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) frequently associate obesity . NAFLD genetic susceptibility involve Patatin Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 3 ( PNPLA3 ) rs738409 Transmembrane 6 Superfamily Member 2 ( TM6SF2 ) rs58542926 polymorphism . To date , biochemical mechanism affect `` metabolic flexibility '' obese NAFLD subject , presence absence genetic susceptibility , need good clarify . Different study demonstrate dietary intervention , accompany physical personalized training , significantly reduce either hepatic fat content either insulin resistance overweight obese subject , independently weight loss . On base , aim study evaluate `` metabolic flexibility '' obese NAFLD subject take account genetics ( presence absence PNPLA3 TM6SF2 polymorphism ) histopathological diagnosis either simple steatosis nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . In addition , composition gut microbiota evaluate . Finally , study , two distinct healthy dietary profile accompany personalized physical training , test order comprehend whether `` healthy diet '' could effective prevention , also clinical treatment NAFLD related condition .</brief_summary>
