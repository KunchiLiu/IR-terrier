	<brief_title>A Multi-center , Randomized Compare Efficacy IVIG Alone IVIG Plus High-dose Aspirin Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Kawasaki disease ( KD ) acute febrile systemic vasculitis commonly see child age 5 year old . High-dose aspirin often administer , duration treatment varies . Many center reduce aspirin dose patient afebrile , even treat say patient IVIG . However , randomize control trial regard high-dose aspirin acute stage KD previously carry . Methods/design : This trial design multi-center , prospective , randomize control , evaluator-blinded trial two parallel group determine whether IVIG alone primary therapy acute-stage KD effective IVIG combine high-dose aspirin therapy . The primary endpoint define CAL formation 6-8 week . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomly assign ( 1:1 ) test group ( receive IVIG ) standard group ( receive IVIG plus high-dose aspirin ) . This clinical trial conduct seven medical center Taiwan . Discussion : Since high-dose aspirin significant anti-inflammatory anti-platelet function , appear low frequency disease outcomes . Furthermore , decrease hemoglobin level . Therefore , investigator initiate randomize control trial determine whether high-dose aspirin necessary acute stage KD .</detailed_description>
