	<detailed_description>Patients CDI benefit assessment monitoring Infectious Diseases ( ID ) expert . Early intervention patient diagnose first episode CDI would reduce unnecessary use antibiotic , improve prognosis ensure compliance clinical practice guideline reduce number recurrence . Primary objective : • To improve prognosis patient CDI hospitalize period intervention : - Increasing compliance clinical practice guideline specific treatment CDI ( episode generate intervention ) , depend severity episode existence previous episode - Reducing recurrence rate mean close follow-up period high risk , avoid factor know predispose recurrence . Secondary objective : - To discontinue reduce spectrum unnecessary antibiotic treatment population ( `` antimicrobial stewardship '' ) , especially episode CDI follow 8 week . - To discontinue inappropriate treatment asymptomatic patient colonized Clostridium difficile . - To identify clinical biological marker could use predictor recurrence . - To identify patient high number recurrence , could benefit novel experimental treatment . MATERIAL AND METHODS : The first 100 patient fulfil inclusion criterion include study . They retrospectively compare first 100 patient diagnosed CDI de previous year ( 2015 ) systematical intervention member Infectious Diseases Unit . Specific `` bundle '' measure patient ICD : This measure base well-known evidence-based element reduce incidence limit spread Clostridium difficile : - Systematic evaluation patient diagnose CDI Infectious Disease expert implementation follow intervention : - To ensure compliance clinical practice guideline specific treatment CDI , depend severity episode existence previous episode , thus improve prognosis patient avoid side effect . - To optimize concomitant antibiotic therapy ( antimicrobial stewardship ) follow intervention : remove unnecessary treatment , shorten antibiotic course far possible avoid , possible , broad-spectrum high risk develop CDI antibiotic . - To reduce indiscriminate use proton-pump inhibitor H2 receptor antagonist . - To provide clear instruction patient family measure implement home discharge . To answer question calm fear CDI need isolation . - To ensure appropriate monitoring period great risk relapse ( 8 week completion antibiotic treatment CDI ) order reduce far possible , number relapse follow intervention : - Personalized assistance telephone email early consultation case recurrence symptom , order make : - Early diagnostic relapse . - Appropriate treatment subsequent episode . - Detection patient could benefit fecal microbiota transplantation . - Personalized assistance telephone email consultation case necessity new antibiotic course order : - Avoid unnecessary antimicrobial treatment . - Choose antibiotic class less risk select C. difficile . - Evaluate preventive measure attempt prevent development CDI . Study timetable - Patients evaluated member research team CDI diagnosis . Specific treatment revise investigator patient 's physician order adapt clinical guideline , depend severity episode existence previous episode . Concomitant antibiotic treatment drop adjust possible . It important clarify study investigator always make suggestion accord current evidence , final decision treatment always make patient 's physician charge . - At end CDI treatment patient evaluate phone outpatient 's clinic order ensure resolution symptom detect possible adverse event . In moment , blood test perform study patient include : Full blood count , basic biochemistry analysis , Iron metabolism parameter : total iron-binding capacity , total serum iron , ferritin transferrin . Nutritional parameter . Inflammatory marker : C-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate . Serum immunoglobulin level , serum complement level ( C3 C4 ) peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulation . - Beyond point , personalize assistance telephone email week 8 week end treatment . - In case recurrence symptom , need admission new antimicrobial treatment , patient see outpatient 's clinic receive individualize advice order achieve early diagnose relapse reduce risk recurrence . Definitions : Diarrhoea : Loose stool , i.e . take shape receptacle correspond Bristol stool chart type 5-7 , plus stool frequency three stool 24 few consecutive hour frequently normal individual . An episode CDI define : A clinical picture compatible CDI microbiological evidence free toxin presence C. difficile stool without reasonable evidence another cause diarrhoea Pseudomembranous colitis diagnose endoscopy , colectomy autopsy . Mild moderate CDI : Diarrhoea without systemic symptom , leukocytosis white blood cell count lower than15,000 cells/mL serum creatinine level less 1.5 time premorbid level . Severe CDI : systemic symptom infection and/or leukocytosis white blood cell count 15,000 cells/mL high serum creatinine level great equal 1.5 time premorbid level . Severe Complicated CDI : define presence severe disease accompany life-threatening condition ileus , toxic megacolon , refractory hypotension and/or multi-organ failure attributable CDI . Ileus : Signs severely disturb bowel function vomit absence stool radiological sign bowel distension . Toxic megacolon : Radiological sign distension colon ( &gt; 6 cm transverse width colon ) sign severe systemic inflammatory response ( nausea , vomit , dehydration , lethargy tachycardia addition fever abdominal pain ) . Leukocyte count consider severity CDI : Any white blood cell count ( WBC ) measure two day two day follow date stool sample . If patient WBC measure date stool sample select . If WBC measure date stool sample WBC measure one day one day follow stool sample , select . If WBC measure one day one day follow stool sample WBC measure two day two day follow stool sample , select . If WBC measure date stool sample WBC measure one day one day follow date stool sample , WBC measure two day two day stool sample measurement , high two measurement select . Definition treatment response : Treatment response present either stool frequency decrease stool consistency improve parameter disease severity ( clinical , laboratory , radiological ) improve new sign severe disease develop . Definition recurrent CDI : Recurrence present CDI re-occurs within 8 week successfully complete treatment CDI . Duration diarrhea : sum day day 1 last day diarrhea , follow 2 day without diarrhea . Antibiotics high , medium low risk CDI : accord table propose Aldeyab et al ( S3 . J Antimicrob Chemother 2012 ; 67 : 2988-2996 ) . Data collection analysis Patients pre-intervention period retrospectively identify data microbiology ( isolate Clostridium difficile 2015 revise ) . Patients intervention period identify prospectively followed member research team . The variable collect coded database analysis . Sample size calculation We present exploratory study aim evaluate impact intervention , consist bundle measure patient diagnose first episode CDI . The bundle include antimicrobial stewardship , close follow-up , optimization specific treatment CDI potential search clinical biological marker recurrence . The required sample size estimate hypothesis application strategy base bundle improve management CDI , would decrease risk recurrence compare usual care perform retrospective period . A recent review evaluate frequency treatment failure recurrence CDI show recurrence rate metronidazole treatment 27.6 % study perform Europe previous 10 year . Based previous literature , expect cumulative incidence recurrence control group 27.6 % . The study would require sample size 99 group ( i.e . total sample size 198 , assume equal group size ) , achieve power 80 % detect reduction proportion 0.15 two group ( reference group - intervention ) two side p-value 0.05 . Statistical Plans In 2014 , institution 188 new case CDI diagnose . We assume approximately 30 % recurrence previous case , extrapolate 1 year enough achieve estimate sample size 100 patient prospective period . The data qualitative variable express absolute value relative frequency . The data quantitative variable show mean ± standard deviation demonstrate normal distribution median interquartile range otherwise . Categorical variable compare use X ^ 2 Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable compare use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U test . Statistical analysis conduct use SPSS version 15.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) .</detailed_description>
