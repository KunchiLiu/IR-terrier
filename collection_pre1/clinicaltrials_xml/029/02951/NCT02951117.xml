	<brief_title>A Study Venetoclax ABBV-838 Combination Therapy With Dexamethasone Participants With Multiple Myeloma Whose Cancer Has Come Back Had No Response Recent Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 2 arm : Arm A Arm B ( applicable ) . Arm A dose escalation investigate 3 dose ABBV-838 3-week dosing interval ( Q3W ) combination venetoclax dexamethasone . Arm A dose expansion portion investigate ABBV-838 Q3W dose interval venetoclax dexamethasone recommend phase two dose ( RPTD ) combination define Dose Escalation portion . Based data ongoing ABBV-838 monotherapy study ( Study M14-467 ) Arm B dose escalation may conduct , deem necessary . If conduct , Arm B dose excalation investigate 3 dose ABBV-838 either weekly ( Q1W ) bi-weekly ( Q2W ) dose interval combination venetoclax dexamethasone . Arm B dose expansion portion investigate either ABBV-838 Q1W Q2W dose interval combination venetoclax dexamethasone RPTD combination define Dose Escalation portion .</detailed_description>
