	<brief_title>The Protective Effect Pentoxifylline Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) refer clinical syndrome characterize rapid ( hour day ) decrease renal function , common important diagnostic therapeutic challenge clinician . The disorder frequency 7.0 % hospital inpatient especially common critically ill patient , prevalence acute kidney injury great 40 % admission intensive care unit sepsis present . AKI independently associate important morbidity mortality although many effort use past year . Therefore , alternative strategy require confer good complete renoprotection suffer AKI . There many study demonstrate phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline ( PTX ) potent anti-inflammatory , anti-proliferative , anti-fibrotic agent capable attenuate experimental renal disease drug , ischemic sepsis induce AKI . We thus hypothesize PTX may therapeutic value AKI human . We thereby design control , non-randomized clinical trial , aim investigate potential renoprotective efficacy PTX , compare placebo , 200 patient AKI .</detailed_description>
