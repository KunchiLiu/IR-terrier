	<criteria>1 . Patients either gender , age 18 year old 65 . 2 . Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic , unresectable locally advanced , recurrent NSCLC . 3 . Radiological documentation disease progression previous continuous treatment EGFR TKI e.g . gefitinib erlotinib Afatinib , Icotinib ( Third EGFR TKI include ) . In addition line therapy may give . 4 . Confirmation tumour harbour EGFR mutation know associated EGFR TKI sensitivity ( include least one G719X , exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q mutation ) 5 . Documented evidence definitely EGFR T790M+ state tumor tissue disease progression recent treatment regimen ( irrespective whether EGFR TKI chemotherapy ) . 6 . ECOG performance status 0 2 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 7 . At least one measurable disease CT PETCT MRI , accord RECIST Version 1.1 . 8 . Organ function must meet follow requirements： Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1.5 x 109/L , Platelet count &gt; = 75 x 109/L , Haemoglobin &gt; = 90 g/L； Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate aminotransferase &lt; = 2.5 time upper limit normal demonstrable liver metastasis &lt; = 5 time presence liver metastases； Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time ULN liver metastasis &lt; = 3 time ULN presence liver metastases liver metastases； Creatinine &lt; =1.5 time ULN concurrent creatinine clearance &gt; = 50 ml/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) ; 9 . Females lactation period must negative pregnancy test prior start dose ; During whole treatment , patient entire 3 month treatment , repeat barrier precaution 10 . Signed consent Independent Ethics Committeeapproved Informed Consent Form prior studyspecific evaluation . 1 . Any cytotoxic chemotherapy previous treatment regimen clinical study within 21 days，Any Target cancer drug previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day , less approximately 5x halflife first dose study treatment； 2 . The third EGFRTKI previous treatment regimen clinical study ( ie , AZD9291 , CO1686 , HM61713 , ASP8273 , EGF816 , avitinib , 3 . Taking ( stop take 1 week first dose receive ) strong inhibitor CYP3A4 antitumor herb . 4 . Unrecovered toxic reaction due former therapy exist , 1 grade CTCAE ( except alopecia ) 2 grade ever apply DDP cure relate neuropathy . 5 . Spinal compression , brain metastasis exhibit symptom untreated ( except exhibit symptom stable condition apply corticosteroid 4 week trail initiate ) 6 . Any evidence show severe inadequate control systemic disease . For example patient inadequate control hypertension consider suitable trail would affect compliance towards protocol , active hemorrhagic tendency , active infection HBV ( HBVDNA≥1000cps/ml ) , HCV , HIV et al ( except HBV carrier researcher consider meet criterion ) . 7 . Any condition affect drug taking , significantly affect absorption pharmacokinetic parameter , include kind uncontrollable nausea vomit , chronic gastroenteropathy , disability swallowing , history gastrointestinal resection surgery . 8 . Any condition meet follow cardiac standard : ECG show QTc &gt; 470 msec rest state ( Repeat 48 hour first abnormal discover , take mean two measurement ) . All kind abnormal cardiac rhythm , conduction rest ECG profile clinical significance , example complete leave bundle branch block , 2 3 grade conduction block PR interval &gt; 250 msec . Any possible factor increase risk QTc extend lead arrhythmia , heart failure , hypokalemia , congenital long QT syndrome , first degree relative suffer long QT syndrome undertook unexplained sudden death 40 year old , take drug lead long QTc . 9 . Any history interstitial lung disease , drug induce interstitial lung disease , radiation pneumonia require steroid therapy active interstitial lung disease clinical evidence recruiting . 10 . Patients factor researcher consider suitable trail ( example , patient willing follow procedure , limitation requirement , experience bone marrow allotransplantation , kinds malignant tumor coexist show allergic active ingredient inactive adjuvant investigational drug , well drug similar chemical structure class ) . 11 . Confirmed mutation EGFR 20 exon insertion anytime first diagnosis .</criteria>
