	<detailed_description>Background The main objective study analyze short-and long-term influence recombinant growth hormone clinical questionnaire base criterion attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder child adolescent . This examined child prior GH therapy 3 , 6 12 month treatment , fill validate questionnaire ( Vanderbilt rating scale ) evaluate ADHD . All participant treat rhGH dos acceptable FDA recommendation . Trial Goal The main goal trial ass association treatment rhGH short period 3 month , long period 3-12 month development characteristic ADHD ( measurable parameter ) Hypothesis Our research hypothesis , although parent fear hyperreactive symptom rGH administration , study demonstrate provide regular management recombinant human growth hormone therapy time , associate significant change attention deficit/hyperactive characteristic compare matched age sex control receive GH treatment . This prospective case control study format study choose order observe document behavioural influence recommend standard treatment GH treatment give accord current guideline . Study population size decide accord statistician calculation 80 % power 5 % significance consiideration 15 % drop-out Trial design An open prospective observational case control study recruit child adolescents prior initiation GH treatment . This single-site study , however patient comply inclusion exclusion criterion , may recruit medium , representative pharmaceutical company , medical association Children 's Endocrinology Association . Every eligible participant , wherever treat condition may take part study . The study design compare , control case-control manner , prospectively . The development ADHD characteristic group patient initiation 12 month treatment rhGH compare similar gender age control group , treat rhGH . Inclusion criterion : - Children age 6 year , less 16 year - Children eligible rhGH treatment accord follow Food Drug Administration approve indication ; Small gesational age , Idioapathic short stature , GH deficiency chronic renal failure . - Consent parent / guardian participate research Exclusion criterion : - Under age 6 year 16 year - Previously diagnose neurocognitive disease - Previously diagnose specific syndrome : Prader-willi syndrome , Turner - Previously diagnose Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder - Poor control Hebrew Statistical Analysis All data present mean , min max . The data divide accord age result . Statistical analysis perform ANOVA repeat measure , examine difference trial control group , 4 different time point , well difference patient , influence time interaction measure .</detailed_description>
