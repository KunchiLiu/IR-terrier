	<detailed_description>We show , first time , Z-score increase obesity dependent sex , severity obesity age also bone site . Although increase BMD bear area seem logically explain assumption mechanical stress osteogenic effect bone tissue , BMD way respond concomitant increase BMD non-load bearing area radius . ( Maïmoun L Col Bone 2015 Dec 1 . S8756-3282 ( 15 ) 00421-4 ) . These result suggest change certain systemic compound , induced obesity , may interfere bone metabolism . Moreover , fact BMD Z score positively correlate muscle mass fat mass confirm mechanical stress factor act bone tissue . Our objective determine relationship plasma concentration myokines , adipokines , bone marker BMD obese subject . Our objective determine relationship plasma concentration myokines ( myostatin , follistatin ) , adipokines ( leptin , adiponectin ) bone marker ( CTX , Trap5 , P1NP , ostéocalcin ) cohort obese patient , differents obesity severity , differents age .</detailed_description>
