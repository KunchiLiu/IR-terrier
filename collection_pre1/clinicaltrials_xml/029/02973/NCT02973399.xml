	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety SNX-5422 Added Established Dose Ibrutinib CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) prevalent leukemia adult consider curable outside allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Significant advance make therapy , notably introduction Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) inhibitor ibrutinib . While response ibrutinib high therapy well-tolerated overall , patient relapse others take therapy toxicity reason . In addition , although remission durable many patient , patient achieve complete response ( CR ) , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity single agent ibrutinib report . Since know chemoimmunotherapy well targeted therapy venetoclax attainment CR associate long progression free survival ( PFS ) , likely deepen response associate ibrutinib result durable remission . Relapse CLL mediate least two separate mechanism . One mutation BTK , variety mutation immediate downstream target BTK , PLCγ2 . SNX-5422 prodrug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) . Hsp90 inhibitor may overcome ibrutinib resistance Mantle cell lymphoma study investigate whether addition SNX-5422 establish dose ibrutinib provide clinical response subject residual disease , progress ibrutinib 18 month monotherapy . Subjects receive SNX‑5422 ( 56 mg/m2 ) morning every day 21 day ( 11 dos ) , follow 7‑day drug‑free period . Subjects continue receive daily oral ibrutinib establish dose level afternoon</detailed_description>
