	<brief_summary>The purpose study help determine effective treatment participant Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis . There currently two type operation use treat condition . One operation call thyroplasty . Doctors place small piece safe plastic side participant 's voice box push weak vocal cord position enable good speech swallow . In operation call laryngeal reinnervation , doctor repair neck nerve supply vocal cord use part unaffected nerve enable good speech swallowing . The investigator know method well conduct study start compare two operation large clinical trial conduct future tell u operation best .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : Does Laryngeal Reinnervation Type I Thyroplasty give good voice result patient Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis ( VOCALIST ) : feasibility study Short title : VOCALIST Trial medication : Not Applicable Phase trial : Phase IIb Objectives : The aim study establish feasibility multicentre , randomise phase III clinical trial surgical treatment Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis ( UVFP ) . Main objectives test feasibility : 1. multicentre recruitment process , include continuous improvement process base qualitative analysis ; 2. recruiter able present true equipoise treatment arm ; 3. randomisation process investigate reason difficulty affect recruitment 4. utility follow characteristic propose primary ( voice handicap index ) secondary outcome : variability across patient , variability time , difference outcome randomise group time ; 5. process follow visit diary completion ; 6. mean gather health economics health-related quality life data suitable measure cost effectiveness . Type trial : Quantitative Qualitative Feasibility Study ; multi-centre randomise control trial Trial design method : 30 patient randomise receive Laryngeal Reinnervation Type I Thyroplasty surgery . Trial duration per participant : 12 month Estimated total trial duration : 24 month Planned trial site : Multi-site ; London , Poole Manchester ( 3 site ) . Total number participant plan : 30 Statistical methodology analysis : The trial analysis descriptive perform intention treat basis . Primary secondary outcome describe use proportion mean appropriate , confidence interval . No formal comparison make . The correlation voice outcome measure calculate . There plan interim analysis .</detailed_description>
