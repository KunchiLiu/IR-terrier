	<brief_title>Chronotype Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Effect Glycaemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence prevalence diabetes mellitus reach 4 million UK . Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) account approximately 90 % UK population diabetes confers significant morbidity mortality patient healthcare system . Despite new therapy management tool improve quality life outcomes patient T2DM , diabetic complication cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain great cause mortality . New paradigms characterise treat patient could enhance current T2DM management . Recently , considerable interest association quantity quality sleep circadian rhythm development cardiometabolic disease especially metabolic syndrome , T2DM CVD . A `` U '' -shaped relationship relate short long sleep duration exist sleep duration T2DM , obesity , CVD , hypertension stroke . A meta-analysis nearly 500,000 individual ( ~4 % T2DM ) identify relative risk ( RR ) 1.14 ( 95 % CI 1.03-1.26 ) every additional hour sleep RR 1.09 ( 95 % CI 1.04-1.15 ) hour shorter sleep compare 7-hours sleep per day development T2DM . Despite many individual consider sleep essential good health instead consider rather inconvenience . Subsequently , lifestyle choice , societal pressure shift-work render population chronically sleep deprived thus increase risk metabolic dysfunction . Sleep regulate , part , homeostatic drive therefore unavoidable human ( without sleep disorder ) . The circadian system , internal clock , also responsible regulation sleep . Sleep multidimensional behaviour ( biological process ) investigator need consider duration quality timing also . A person 's sleep pattern , relation 24-hour clock , i.e . timing , individual refer chronotype . The investigator quantitatively characterize individual difference daily time use number questionnaire base tool . Five different chronotypes identify use 'Morningness-Eveningness ' Questionnaire i.e . definite even type , moderate evening type , intermediate , moderate morning type definite morning type.The identification different chronotypes , describes prefer circadian phase , , two extreme , `` morning type '' `` even type '' lead research confirm `` even type '' great risk cardiometabolic disease . The underlying cause clearly define appear related circadian mal-alignment cause chronic sleep deprivation lead dysregulation metabolic , immune hormonal process govern energy regulation glycaemic control . Several clock gene identify control circadian rhythm include Clock ( Circadian locomotor output cycle protein kaput ) , Npas2 ( Neuronal PAS domain protein2 ) , Bmal1 ( Brain muscle ARNT-like protein ) , Per1 ( Period ) , Per2 , Per3 , Cry1 ( Cryptochrome ) , Cry2 , Rev-Erbs ( Reverse erythroblastosis virus ) CkI ( Casein kinase ) . However role , prevention progression T2DM remain elucidate . The concept `` social jetlag '' develop describe deleterious effect chronic sleep deprivation relate weekday occupational obligation `` even type '' weekend social demand `` morning type '' . For example , large epidemiological study Germany show social jetlag associate obesity . Several public health question raise association , least whether chronotyping individual consider whether individual chronotype adjust sleep hygiene training ( require discipline maintenance ) and/or exogenous treatment melatonin . In cross-sectional observational study , investigator therefore propose extensively chronotype sample patient T2DM , determine impact chronotype glycaemic control , insulin resistance , biochemical profile , inflammatory , adipocytokine genetic marker use validated questionnaire blood test . In optional sub-study explore association chronotype objectively measure physical activity , energy intake clock gene .</detailed_description>
