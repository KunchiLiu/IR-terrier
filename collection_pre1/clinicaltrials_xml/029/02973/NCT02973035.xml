	<detailed_description>Approximately half hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction diastolic dysfunction associate development congestive heart failure increase mortality . The Framingham study report 51 % patient HF preserve leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction hypertension strong risk factor HF preserve ejection fraction , also term diastolic heart failure . The rate death morbidity patient high patient HF low LV ejection fraction . Hypertensive patient increase risk develop LV hypertrophy myocardial fibrosis , cause relaxation abnormality decrease compliance LV rise LV diastolic pressure . Although diastolic HF associate hypertension clinically significant problem , clinical trial conduct proven pharmacological therapy improve outcome . Because activation rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) show induce LV hypertrophy myocardial fibrosis , RAAS may play central role pathogenic process hypertension diastolic HF . Inhibitors RAAS consider treatment option patient , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) interest antagonize effect angiotensin II completely . However , Irbesartan Heart Failure Preserved Systolic Function ( I-PRESERVE ) trial report treatment irbesartan reduce risk death hospitalization cardiovascular cause among 4,128 patient HF preserve LV ejection fraction . The degree improvement diastolic dysfunction associate extent systolic blood pressure reduction , whether RAAS inhibitor non-RAAS blood pressure lower use . The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ) compare benefit treatment systolic blood pressure target le 120 mmHg treatment target le 140 mmHg , recently report target systolic blood pressure le 120 mmHg , compare less 140 mmHg , result low rate fatal nonfatal major cardiovascular event all-cause death . Amlodipine potent well-tolerated calcium channel blocker , seem appropriate achieve aggressive systolic blood pressure target improve diastolic dysfunction hypertensive patient , amlodipine clinically useful control systolic blood pressure . Evaluating effect treatment diastolic dysfunction limit difficulty non-invasive measure LV diastolic pressure , recent advance echocardiography make possible assess diastolic dysfunction accurately reproducibly . Thus , assessment diastolic function echocardiography helpful determine whether addition amlodipine ARB standard therapy beneficial hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction . To best knowledge , randomize trial compare effect amlodipine versus ARB improve diastolic dysfunction hypertensive patient . The investigator hypothesize amlodipine added standard therapy superior valsartan improve diastolic dysfunction lower systolic blood pressure effectively hypertensive patient , try examine hypothesis prospective , open-label , randomized comparison study use blind echocardiographic evaluation end point .</detailed_description>
