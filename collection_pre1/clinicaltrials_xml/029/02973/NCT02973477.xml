	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect dapagliflozin , FDA approve diabetes medication , measure nervous system function heart patient type 2 diabetes . The investigator compare effect dapagliflozin active comparator , glimepiride ( different FDA approve diabetes medication ) measure heart rate variability ass whether dapagliflozin modulate effect measure nervous system function heart . This crossover study design participant receive study medication equally ( 12-week intervention period ) certain order .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dapagliflozin Measures Cardiovascular Autonomic Function Patients With Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale : Empagliflozin dapagliflozin sodium-glucose transporter-2 ( SGLT-2 ) inhibitor prevent reabsorption glucose via proximal renal tubule , recently approve class treat hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes . Besides effective glucose lower effect document ~ 0.7-1.2 % HbA1c reduction , agent also promote weight loss reduce blood pressure ( BP ) . Furthermore , recent data Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Trial type 2 diabetes ( EMPA-REG OUTCOME ) report significant reduction main cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) outcomes CVD death patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . The exact mechanism beneficial effect cardiovascular outcome yet understood , although effect body weight , glucose control BP reduction suggest . However , class drug similar effect GLP-1 receptor agonist , thiazolidinedione clearly show beneficial effect CVD outcomes . The interesting observation improvement BP SGLT-2 inhibitor occur without compensatory increase HR benefit obtain also patient evidence heart failure . Thus , investigator postulate hypothesis SGLT-2 may also modulatory effect sympathetic/parasympathetic balance , may contribute potential benefit cardiovascular outcome patient diabetes . Study Design : The investigator plan test hypothesis randomize , double-blind , 2-period crossover clinical trial compare 12-weeks glycemic intervention dapagliflozin versus glimepiride . The investigator include active comparator glimepiride similar glucose lower patient T2D , account effect reduction blood glucose measure CAN , evaluate whether change measure CAN different among patient take glimepiride dapagliflozin . The two crossover period separate 2-week wash-out period . All subject allocate randomized treatment sequence . Participants receive blindly either dapagliflozin 5 mg glimepiride 2 mg 1 tablet daily initially 4 week titrate dose base blood glucose level 2 tablet daily 8 week ( total 12 week ) follow 2-week washout period receive study drug reverse order first period second crossover period 12 week . Study population : 45 patient T2D background metformin monotherapy meeting ADA recommend glycemic target . Primary outcome : change measure cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy heart rate variability ( HRV ) define frequency domain measure HRV : low frequency ( LF ) power ( ms2 ) ; high frequency ( HF ) power ( ms2 ) measure LF : HF ratio . Secondary outcome : ( ) change measure HRV define time domain measure HRV : standard deviation normal RR interval ( SDNN ) ( msec ) root mean square difference successive RR interval ( rmsSD ) ( msec ) ; ( ii ) change cardiovascular autonomic reflex test ( CARTs ) define : expiration/inspiration ( E/I ) ratio , Valsalva ratio , 30:15 ratio ; ( iii ) change measure systolic diastolic function assess use stress echocardiogram evaluate follow measure : ) LVEF , ii ) LV end diastolic volume , iii ) LV end systolic volume , iv ) LV mass , v ) cardiac output .</detailed_description>
