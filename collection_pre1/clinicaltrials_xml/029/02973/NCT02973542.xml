	<brief_summary>Abdominal pain remain deleterious symptom patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) cause significant alteration quality life . The visceral hypersensitivity seem one key mechanism could explain abdominal pain patient . Current treatment , mainly symptomatic , limited effectiveness , especially term relief abdominal pain . The study aim evaluate effectiveness ethosuximide abdominal pain patient IBS , tolerance impact patient quality life , severity symptom relate IBS use analgesic / antispasmodic / regulator transit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) characterize combination discomfort / abdominal pain bowel habit absence identifiable organic pathology . This condition extremely common first cause consultation gastroenterology would cover 10-15 % French . This chronic condition , although functional , impact significantly quality life patient cause considerable health spending , make major public health problem . Especially currently use treatment limited effectiveness . Among pathophysiological mechanism involve IBS , visceral hypersensitivity ( VHS ) seem major factor cause pain patient . VHS involve sensitization colonic nerve fiber , result increase neuronal excitability . In several animal model chronic pain , hyperexcitability relate change expression activity ion channel , include calcium channel Cav3.2 . Investigators especially show involvement Cav3.2 channel visceral pain animal model VHS . Furthermore , overexpression channel peripheral level ( dorsal root ganglion innervate colon ) demonstrate animal model pharmacological blockade , include ethosuximide , prevent development VHS . Note Cav3.2 channel widely demonstrate involved nociceptive phenomenon various animal model chronic pain block ethosuximide induce analgesic effect model . Finally , recently demonstrate involvement Cav3.2 channel patient IBS , clinical case-control study . The Cav3.2 channel overexpressed colonic mucosa patient IBS compare asymptomatic control . The Cav3.2 channel therefore potential pharmacological target ethosuximide promising therapy effectively treat abdominal pain associate IBS .</detailed_description>
