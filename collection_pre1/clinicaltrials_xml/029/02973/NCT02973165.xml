	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Emotional cognition : To learn damage specific white matter structure pathways subsequent mild TBI alter emotional cognition Hypothesis Rationale Comment Research hemispheric laterality emotion complicate . Because research level specificity relatively new , unclear whether injury white matter structure cause release blunt effect different emotion ( e.g. , injury right uncinate fasciculus might cause exaggerated anger response , blunt positive affect ) . It depend nature contribution various component limbic pathway study . For example , damage uncinate fasciculus result lack regulatory input amygdala orbitofrontal cortex ? If , function circuit inhibit modulate amygdala activity ? Because complexity , hypotheses/predictions bi-directional . Hypothesis 1 Left Hemisphere : Decreased white matter integrity leave uncinate fasciculus leave anterior limb internal capsule affect positively valenced emotional cognition ( i.e. , patient rating valence intensity positive emotional image ) . The effect blunt release effect ( reduction increase rating intensity positive emotional stimulus ) . Hypothesis 2 Right Hemisphere : Decreased white matter integrity right uncinate fasciculus right anterior limb internal capsule affect negative emotional cognition ( i.e. , patient rating valence intensity negative emotional image ) . The effect blunt release effect ( reduction increase rating intensity negative emotional stimulus ) . Aim 2 : Emotional physiology : To examine impact white matter injury specific tracts structures interest [ e.g. , uncinate fasciculus anterior limb internal capsule ] mild TBI autonomic nervous system response emotional image . Hypothesis 3 Decreased white matter integrity leave uncinate fasciculus associate lower rest vagal tone ( due preferential access leave hemisphere parasympathetic nervous system regulation ) Hypothesis 4 Decreased white matter integrity right uncinate fasciculus associate higher rest vagal tone ( due preferential access right hemisphere sympathetic nervous system control ) Hypothesis 5 Decreased white matter integrity leave right uncinate fasciculus leave right anterior limb internal capsule associate either increase startle response decrease startle response ( laterality prediction issue Aim 1 ) Hypothesis 6 Decreased white matter integrity leave right uncinate fasciculus leave right anterior limb internal capsule associate either increase decrease vagal response emotional image ( depend positive negative valence ) . Pilot Phase : Aim 1 : Emotional Cognition : To determine vagal nerve stimulation alters emotional cognition patient mild TBI PTSD . A sub-aim evaluate impact affective communication ( facial emotion , body language , etc . ) versus affective induction ( e.g. , picture bodily waste pollution ) use establish protocol battery stimulus . This aim may ( optional ) include fMRI fear condition learn task ( stimulation ) . Hypothesis 1 : Intensity rating positive negative stimulus modulate towards neutral , alternatively , negative stimuli rating modulate towards neutral . Hypothesis 2 : Identification emotional stimulus faster , particularly positive imagery . This pronounced emotional face pictures/videos versus non-social imagery . Hypothesis 3 : Fear condition learn normalized tVNS patient mTBI/PTSD , PTSD , resemble healthy control . Aim 2 : Emotional Physiology : To determine vagal nerve stimulation alters autonomic reactivity context baseline emotional stress response . Hypothesis 1 : Baseline cardiac vagal tone high robust positional manipulation active VNS . Hypothesis 2 : Autonomic startle response negative imagery less pronounced ( e.g. , respiratory sinus arrhythmia , heart rate ) active VNS . Aim 3 : Sleep Quality : Patients PTSD symptom sleep disruption include change sleep architecture frequent occurrence nightmare . Vagal nerve stimulation decrease amygdala activity , previously show fMRI response VNS ( Kraus et al. , 2007 ) , amygdala/prefrontal EEG signal alter patient PTSD . We evaluate sleep architecture change patient TBI/PTSD also qualitative rating sleep quality vagal nerve stimulation . Hypothesis 1 : Sleep architecture appear normal VNS without . Hypothesis 2 : Qualitative rating sleep improve VNS compare without . 6 . Research Plan : Recruitment goal Because publish data exist directly test relationships variable collect specific outcome measure , power analysis deem unhelpful . Rather , estimate sample need base research Dr. Porges ' lab examine cognitive , affective physical stressor impact respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) normal , research use similar method adult hostile men , stroke patient , incidence emotional symptom mild TBI , document impact white matter change fronto-subcortical system mild TBI . We intend recruit 60 subject mild TBI PTSD , 60 subject PTSD TBI , 60 subject history combat exposure TBI PTSD ) . We recruit many subject participate pilot test . This dependent funding time , , purpose IRB enrollment , likely need 100 subject pilot ( distribute across subject category ) . General procedure study visit Participants examine comfortable private testing office VAMC neuropsychological ANS method `` state art '' McKnight Brain Institute image center UF MRI procedure . The order administration test emotion cognition counterbalance across subject prevent test order effect control potential systematic impact fatigue . This protocol may require two visit ( due coordination neuroimaging evaluation ) expect take 3-4 hour ( total ) . For participant invite choose participate pilot test , additional 3-4 hour necessary . Neuropsychological test Subsequent structure interview gather demographic data , health history , TBI history ( include # TBIs ) , 30 minute cognitive screening administer characterize sample examine relationship affective battery cognitive measure associate disruption white matter pathway . The following test administer : Wechsler Test Adult Reading ( WTAR ) : Because cognitive ability common protective factor many condition ( e.g. , stall onset clinical syndrome neurodegenerative disease , decrease likelihood mental illness ) , assess several aspect intellectual function . The WTAR ( Wechsler , 2001 ) commonly use tool estimation premorbid cognitive ability . It develop co-normed concurrent Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - 3rd Edition ( WAIS-III ) Wechsler Memory Scale- 3rd Edition ( WMS-III ) . It highly correlate verbal intelligence quotient ( IQ ) derive WAIS-III ( Wechsler , 1997 ) . The WTAR require participant read aloud series increasingly infrequent word irregular grapheme-to-phoneme translation . Epworth Sleepiness Scale - This eight question scale design assess sleepiness . Pittsburgh Sleep Scale - Scale design assess sleep quality . Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory ( NSI ) - Scale assess frequent symptom TBI . Phonemic Fluency : Phonemic fluency ( Controlled Oral Word Association Test ) ( Benton et al , 1994 ) require production word quickly phonemic confrontation ( e.g. , F , A , S ) . It time test ( 60 second per trial ) . Phonemic fluency choose research suggest differential performance clinical population potential identify separate executive process base involvement different area prefrontal cortex ( Stuss et al. , 1998 ) . Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) - The RBANS screening instrument use assess mild TBI population past ( e.g. , Cooper et al. , 2010 ) . It comprise measure list , logical , visual memory , semantic fluency , digit span , cod , visuospatial construction . It take 20 minute administer . Test Memory Malingering ( TOMM ) Effort test essential behavioral study mild TBI due secondary gain potential literature demonstrate litigation status moderate factor presence chronic cognitive deficit . The TOMM ( Tombaugh , 1997 ) design assist assessment effort . It 50 item visual recognition paradigm . Participants show 50 easily identifiable line drawing . Immediately , show series line draw include novel previously view item . Participants must indicate see item . The test repeat immediately 10 min delay . Beck Depression Inventory - II ( BDI-2 ) To characterize current mood compare mood rating measure emotional processing , administer several commonly use questionnaire ( comparison study ) The BDI-2 self-report scale design measure current depress mood disturbance . It comprise 21 multiple choice category ( e.g. , sadness , suicidally , regret ) ( Beck , 1996 ) . The questionnaire take approximately five minute complete validate use people age 13 80 . PTSD Checklist-Military ( PCL-M ) The PCL-M ( Weathers et al. , 1994 ) Likert base checklist design ass symptom associate PTSD . It tailor military experience . This often used current tool establish effect trauma presentation PTSD symptom ( e.g. , McGhee et al. , 2009 ; Souza et al. , 2008 ; Richardson et al. , 2006 ) . The Migraine Disability Assessment Test ( MIDAS ) Headache Impact Test ( HIT-6 ) These two time-efficient scale assess impact headache ( MIDAS = 7-items ) ( HIT-6 = 6 item ) ( Stewart et al. , 2001 ; Kosinski et al. , 2003 ) Symptom Checklist 90 Revised ( SCL-90-R ) The SCL-90-R ( Derogatis , 1994 ) widely use 90-item self-report psychological inventory measure nine primary symptom dimension generates three global index psychological symptomatic distress . This tool show sensitive issue patient experience mild TBI ( Westcott &amp; Alfano , 2005 ) . Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Short From - A standardized , short , structured interview design elicit rich lifetime TBI history . State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) The STAI psychological inventory base 4-point Likert scale consist 40 question self-report basis . The STAI measure two type anxiety - state anxiety , anxiety event , trait anxiety , anxiety level personal characteristic . Higher score positively correlate high level anxiety . Its current revision Form Y . Tests Emotion In order test emotional processing , measure physiological response two set emotional stimulus ( visual scene , affective face ) . Further , compare patient mild TBI control normative sample evaluation emotional content ( e.g. , intensity , valence , reaction time , categorical rating ) . Moreover , examine emotional context ( e.g. , look high arousal , negatively valanced visual scene ) influence startle response presence specific white matter change . For follow condition , physiological monitoring ( described psychophysiology method ) record continuously event marker use identify condition segment . Each condition precede 3 minute physiological baseline follow 3 minute physiological recovery period . Pictures ( International Affective Picture System - IAPS ) video ( Dynamic Affect Recognition System - DARE ) present 22 inch LCD monitor participant seat comfortable chair throughout administration . Startle-Blink Procedure International Affective Picture System Startle-blink response show differentiate normal , clinical , subclinical population respect individual difference emotional processing ( physiology cognition ) include depression , schizophrenia , specific phobia , anxiety , personality disorder ( Sanchez et al. , 2009 ; Schact et al. , 2009 ; Li Li et al. , 2009 ) . Further , startle response show sensitive difference white matter structure population ( e.g. , autism ; McAlonan et al. , 2002 ) . The startle blink procedure divide two administration condition , neutral ( unprimed ) emotion ( prim ) . In unprimed condition , startle-blink response elicit single 50 m burst white noise ( 95 db , instantaneous rise time ) deliver binaurally stereo headphone . There 12 probe deliver random time interval absence stimulus ( unprimed startle ) . The emotion condition use picture draw International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) ( Lang et al. , 2001 ) normative study ( Lang et al. , 2001b ) large study participant rat IAPS picture discrete emotion ( intensity valence ) ( Bradley et al. , 2001 ) . Forty-eight picture ( 12 disgust , 12 fear , 12 neutral , 12 pleasant ) use startle probe present sixteen non-probe trial administer . For complete example methodology please see Miller et al. , ( 2009 ) . Dynamic Affect Recognition Evaluation The processing emotion human especially gear towards response face . Facial affect process critical proper social engagement influence physiological state . For example , trait hostility ( personality ) associate inaccurate identification anger neutral affective face alter pattern cardiovascular response stress ( Herridge et al. , 2004 ) . The amygdala , important limbic structure strong white matter connection frontal cortex autonomic nucleus brain stem , show repeatedly preferentially respond emotional face ( e.g. , Blasi et al. , 2009 ; Derntl et al. , 2009 ) . Further , Adolphs et al . ( 2000 ) suggest damage white matter tract give rise emotional perception deficit . In study similar design propose investigation , though use static face severe TBI , damage white matter subsequent TBI associate impaired performance emotional face perception ( Green et al , 2004 ) . However , study use CT scan localization damage visual identification . They suggest use MRI quantify/qualify relationship . The Dynamic Affect Recognition Evaluation ( DARE ) ( Porges , Cohn , Bal , &amp; Lamb , 2007 ) use standardized presentation emotional expression ( facial ) . The DARE stimulus develop Cohn-Kanade Action Unit-Coded Facial Expression Database . The database include approximately 2000 image sequence 200 human subject . In current research , modify version stimulus develop Cohn et al . ( Cohn , Zlochower , Lien , &amp; Kanade , 1999 ) use . The stimuli include uncompressed video file ( i.e. , series still image ) consist six basic emotion . These image morph final video include face start neutral expression slowly transition one six target emotion . Recently , example , Pelphrey et al . ( 2007 ) use similar procedure ( i.e. , fearful angry emotion morphs ) report hypoactivation right amygdala fusiform gyrus adult autism view dynamic expression , suggest appropriate network involvement propose mild TBI investigation . In current study , video length varies ( range 15 33 second ) depend number frame original image sequence ( independent emotion category ) . The DARE software also provide output file show order video present latency recognize emotion . Neuroimaging Analysis Approach Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) primary tool use evaluate integrity white matter propose investigation . DTI measure aggregate movement water molecule image voxel . Movement water affect cell membrane , protein lipid , include myelin sheath generate oligodendroglia telencephalon . Deterioration myelin detectable via measurement diffusion . One measure white matter integrity derive DTI Fractional Anisotropy ( FA ) . FA index randomness water movement brain . An FA value zero indicate movement water random , whereas FA value one indicate movement water one direction ( non-random ) . White matter fiber orient one direction ( tract ) , high FA collection axon disperse orientation . As white matter tract degrade ( E.g. , injury ) , FA value decrease due increase randomness diffusion . Thus , FA value use measure integrity white matter connection . The quality DTI map ( ability see specific white matter tract structure ) dependent , primarily , two variable , number scan direction ( vector ) resolution ; although pulse sequence factor also play role . At McKnight Brain Institute University Florida , collaboration Dr. Thomas Mareci , member Crosson lab use technique call HARDI ( High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ) . Use HARDI allow oversampling diffusion voxel , result enhance signal noise ratio measurement FA compare standard DTI measure . HARDI also advantage estimation probability water diffusion direction voxel compare standard DTI approach . The total MRI acquisition protocol approximately 1 hour . The sequence use different pilot versus . The pilot sequence include task dependent fMRI , whereas non-pilot sequence . Image Analyses Regions Interest Definition ( Post-Processing ) : Processing complete use array MRI analysis tool . Psychophysiology method analysis approach Heart rate data collect use three-lead ECG configuration . The ECG signal acquire sample rate 1 kHz use Biopac amplifier acquisition software . Offline software use detect R-wave sequential heart beat ECG generate series sequential heart period define R-R interval . The heart period data visually inspect edited identify miss faulty R-wave detection remove effect ventricular arrhythmia ( i.e. , RSA atrial rhythm ) . Editing consist integer arithmetic ( e.g. , divide interval detection miss add interval spuriously invalid detection occur ) . These data use calculate heart rate variability statistic include measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) ( index vagal tone parasympathetic nervous system activity ) . Tilt Table : To assess baroreceptor activity , use tilt procedure . Subjects lie table design tilt procedure BRRC . Continuous blood pressure ( use finger cuff arm cuff ) measure along ECG subject slowly move 90 degree ( upright ) 60 degree ( slightly recline ) 30 degree ( recline little ) back 60 degree 90 degree . Each angle hold three minute . EMG startle-blink response Surface Ag-AgCl electrode position participant ' leave right eye record electromyographic ( EMG ) activity orbicularis oculi muscle . Data participant visually examine clear artifact ( e.g. , eyeblinks probe onset ) reject upon identification . Additionally , trial participant turn away close eye discard . Data reduction complete use data condense software program . Latency amplitude peak response within 20-120 m subsequent probe onset determine . Trials peak latency outside range discard ( likely unrelated probe ) . A left right eye standardize score generate , use participant 's performance `` baseline .
