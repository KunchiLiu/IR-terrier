	<brief_title>Study VF001-DP Patients With Chronic Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study demonstrate effectiveness safety VF001-DP adjunct standard care ( SC ) treatment chronic venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) compare Placebo SC course 12‑week Treatment Phase . Design : This study multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled dose‑response study design evaluate VF-001-DP adjunct SC , versus Placebo SC treatment chronic VLUs . The SC therapy VLUs moisture retentive ulcer dress multi‑layer compression therapy . Mepitel® Coban2® chosen use SC trial . The study three ( 3 ) phase : Screening ( 2 week ) , Treatment Phase ( 12 week ) Follow-Up ( 12 week ) . Only patient whose study ulcer exhibit 30 % change ( increase decrease ) ulcer size post-debridement Screening Phase Visit ( S1 ) Treatment Phase Visit ( T1 ) continue meet eligibility criterion T1 randomize receive either Active Treatment group ( VF001-DP low high dose plus SC ) Control Treatment group ( Placebo plus SC ) ratio 1:1:1 . Treatment : Eligible patient assign one follow treatment group : - Placebo SC - VF001-DP ( 14 microgram per treatment ) SC ( low dose [ LD ] ) - VF001-DP ( 140 microgram per treatment ) SC ( high dose [ HD ] ) . The investigational product ( IP ) , i.e. , VF001-DP placebo , supply 1 mL syrinx contain 0.5 mL either VF001-DP Placebo . The IP contain part normal vitronectin Insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-I ) combine single protein ( vitronectin , amino acid 1-64 human sequence IGF-I amino acid 1‑70 human sequence ) , 14 μg 140 μg protein 0.5 mL Phosphate Buffered Saline , pH 7.2 . VF001-DP manufacture utilizing expression vector system yeast Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) make include product human animal origin . Number Patients : It plan recruit 168 patient ( 56 per treatment group ) 26 centre USA study .</detailed_description>
