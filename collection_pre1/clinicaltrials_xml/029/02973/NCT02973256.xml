	<detailed_description>Meningiomas malignant component include grade II meningioma ( GIIM , common one ) grade III meningioma ( GIIIM ) . They represent 5-35 % meningioma . Histological diagnosis GIIM criterion change 2007 might view quite subjective . `` Standards care '' consensus exist GIIM , particularly regard perform , , radiotherapy surgery . One limitation literature lack data health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . Clinical trial GIIM difficult conduct . No result make available . Main objective : assess impact postoperative radiotherapy GIIM surgery overall survival ( OS ) population-setting study . Secondary objective ( GIIM GIIIM ) : - Evaluate recurrence/progression free survival ( PFS ) , volumetric velocity tumor growth ( VVTG ) surgery treatment . - Evaluate long term HRQoL . - Evaluate relevance impact histopathological review population set . - Looking prognostic ( clinical , radiological biological ) factor . - Proposing therapeutic decision tree general certain category patient . - Identifying relevant case conduct study identify new therapeutic target . - Perspectives TUCERA network help design specific prospective project . - Looking disparity care management , survival HRQoL various region France . Design study : nationwide population-based study analysis pattern care/quality care study , case incident GIIM GIIIM operate Metropolitan France 2007-2010 period . The methodology use base multidisciplinary national network already establish French Brain Tumor DataBase ( FBTDB ) , active participation society involve French neuro-oncology `` Inter Groupe Coop√©rateur en Neuro-Oncologie '' , label French National Cancer Institute . The FBTDB already identify incident case GIIM ( n=1046 ) GIIIM ( n=158 ) operate Metropolitan France 2007 2010 . The study propose retrospective study base medical chart patient . Furthermore , survive patient lose follow-up , follow-up consultation include prospective HRQoL evaluation ( cutoff date : 2019/11/30 ) . It conduct systematic pathological review ( eventually additional biological work-up ) , study prognostic factor ( clinical , radiological , biological ) , treatment administer , OS , PFS . Primary endpoint : OS . The statistical analysis ( answer main question ) concern GIIM . Hypothesis : Experimental group : Group GIIM postoperative radiotherapy ( n=314 ) . Control group : Group GIIM postoperative follow-up ( n=732 ) . With bilateral type I error 5 % ( two-sided ) statistical power 80 % able demonstrate postoperative radiotherapy associate Hazard ratio ( mortality risk ) 0.80 . Secondary endpoint ( GIIM GIIIM ) : - PFS , VVTG surgery treatment . - HRQoL assess use EORTC QLQ-C30 , BN20 questionnaires , Europol EQ5D , questionnaire professional social activity ( HRQoL assess patient alive , every six month , since inclusion , 18-month period ) . - Mapping HRQoL questionnaire . - Concordance/discordance analysis initial histological diagnosis diagnosis pathological review . - Conduct inventory cryopreserved material available translational research . It expect : - Define subgroup patient , accord prognostic factor , would benefit postoperative radiotherapy GIIM . - Define subgroup patient , accord prognostic factor , would benefit postoperative radiotherapy GIIM . - Propose personalized therapeutic attitude accord prognostic factor ( clinical , radiological , biological ) general , also specific category patient elderly subject . - Define subgroup GIIM GIIIM justify conduct trial framework TUCERA network . - Evaluate population setting , relevance impact systematic histopathological review . - Develop HRQoL evaluation population setting . - Acquire well knowledge prognostic factor ( clinical , radiological biological ) GIIM GIIIM , natural history , maybe help determine element able differentiate GIIM progress GIIIM , remain GIIM . - Build clinical-biological database identify and/or develop new therapeutic target GIIM GIIIM . - Evaluate potential disparity term survival HRQoL different French region , disparity find , look eventual cause .</detailed_description>
