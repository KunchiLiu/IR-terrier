	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) present 1 7 population confers high risk cardiovascular disease . The pathophysiology cardiovascular disease CKD poorly understand CKD always accompany confound factor include underlying disease process ( e.g . diabetes mellitus , systemic vasculitis ) consequence CKD include hypertension , anaemia inflammation . Nephrectomy kidney donor cause 30 % reduction renal function provide ideal study population measure prospectively effect reduce kidney function cardiovascular system . The CRIB-Donor study ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01028703 ) demonstrate adverse effect cardiovascular structure function 12 month compare control include increase leave ventricular mass . This proposal measure change cardiovascular structure function , cardiovascular age biochemical change 5 year provide information long term effect reduce renal function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A reduction renal function one year kidney donor associate adverse cardiovascular structural functional change . Increases LV mass perhaps fibrosis along increase arterial stiffness associate adverse change prognostic image biomarkers may long term contribute development clinical disease heart failure arrhythmia . It important follow valuable well characterise cohort subject investigate natural history cardiovascular effect determine whether change tend regress , stabilise worsen time . Hypotheses : The reduction GFR occur surgical uni-nephrectomy donor associate long term adverse cardiac vascular effect include : 1 . A sustained increased leave ventricular mass , impaired leave ventricular systolic diastolic function increase leave ventricular interstitial fibrosis . 2 . Reduced aortic distensibility . 3 . Increased systolic diastolic blood pressure . 4 . Increases oxidative stress , inflammation collagen turnover 5 . Cardiovascular ageing evidence adverse effect telomere length DNA damage . Study design : We aim follow 124 patient originally take part CRIB-DONOR study 5 year eventually 10 year post nephrectomy . Statistics sample size : Using effect size variance previous work ( change LV mass 7g , SD change 10g ) calculate study 50 subject group 93 % power detect difference LV mass 7g alpha value 0.05 . Due nature follow study drop expect . A minimum 34 patient require group order achieve 80 % power . This effect clinically important ; fall LV mass index one SD show associate 38 % reduction cardiovascular mortality . With respect telomere shorten , assume mean SD base pair length 5500 530 study able detect difference 0.612 SD , i.e . 324 base pair . A sample size 50 patient per group would provide 85 % power detect difference .</detailed_description>
