	<brief_title>The Inter Intra Reliability Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Research : The definition 'aneurysm ' permanent , localise dilatation blood vessel heart chamber . The abdominal aorta large blood vessel human body usually diameter 1.8 -2.0 centimetre ( cm ) , dependant age , sex body habitus . Aortic dilatation generally class 'aneurysm ' dilation vessel 1.5 time normal size . An abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) affect part aorta diaphragm 80 % typically find renal artery aortic bifurcation . Risk Factors There many factor relate development AAA . Gender one big non-modifiable risk factor , AAA four six time likely male compare female . Furthermore , development AAA females occur approximately ten year later male . The risk AAA also increase family history disease , especially relative first degree . There also evidence suggest association AAA coronary heart disease . Hypertension also find closely correlate development AAA . Additionally , also strong link smoking likelihood AAA development . Conversely , whilst risk AAA development woman less men , woman show vulnerable develop AAA male counterpart . The risk AAA 's also increase age 65 year . If AAA leave undetected untreated increase likelihood rupture occur . This cause critical internal bleeding often result death . Rupture AAA cause approximately 6000 death per year United Kingdom . Figures 1997- 2005 show decrease mortality due early detection ( around five ten year ) . The likelihood rupture increase due age , sex , smoking , hypertension size growth rate aneurysm . The size aneurysm strong predictor risk rupture , smoke also contribute acceleration expansion rate . Ultrasound Screening : Ultrasound screening preferred tool identify monitoring development AAA highly sensitive , cost effective non-invasive tool . The National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guideline recommend National Health Service ( NHS ) offer ultra-sonographic screening male age 65 . The ultrasound scan enable medical screener determine size abdominal aorta . According NICE ( 1.3 ) guideline AAA categorise size , diameter le three cm classify normal follow require . Patients aneurysm diameter 3- 4.4 cm re-scanned yearly , 4.5 -5.4 cm rescanned quarterly ( every three month ) . AAA patient diameter great 5.4 cm refer vascular consultant diagnosis treatment . An AAA either true false , true aneurysm commonly find . True aneurysms ; involve three layer blood vessel wall Intima , Media Adventitia , whereas false aneurysm essentially haematoma form outside vessel wall . Surgical management AAA : Following diagnosis large AAA two possible medical surgical intervention , open endovascular repair ( EVAR ) .Open repair consider major surgical procedure possible complication preoperative assessment carefully manage . There three approach whilst perform AAA laparotomy , transverse incision , longitude midline incision retroperitoneal approach . The aortic segment replace prosthetic graft . After operation patient often monitor intensive care unit ( ICU ) average remain hospital seven fourteen day . EVAR hand less invasive procedure , less painful shorter stay hospital often require stay ICU . EVAR gain access though femoral artery insert send graft inside abdominal aneurysm . Preoperative Risk Management : Surgeons base decision operate two major factor , firstly risk rupture , secondly diameter aneurysm growth rate . Before surgery vascular consultant subject patient preoperative functional capacity assessment ( FCA ) . The surgeon use FCA establish potential operative postoperative risk . Patients often comorbidities risk operating may outweigh potential benefit , therefore increase risk premature mortality . The use FCA become important screen tool evaluate fitness AAA patient , serve good indictor risk surgery postoperative recovery . There various way test FCA ( step test , spirometry cardiopulmonary exercise test etc . ) however , recently cardiopulmonary exercise test describe preferable tool evaluate AAA patient 's functional capacity . Cardio pulmonary exercise testing : It widely accept cardio-pulmonary exercise test ( CPEX ) 'gold standard ' FCA . Furthermore , CPEX non-invasive , cost effective objective . It use many year elite sport performance research screen become increasingly utilised clinical environment . CPEX test allows clinician perform control exercise test safe environment . It involve measurement number physiological parameter , well respiratory cardiac monitoring.The basic underlying physiological principle underlie CPEX measure efficiency capacity oxygen-transport system ; also examine individual 's ability exercise cardiovascular response variable level exertion . A CPEX provide breath breath analysis provide several important outcome . These ; ( 1 ) VO2 MAX , ( 2 ) VeO2 , ( 3 ) VECO2 , ( 4 ) anaerobic threshold ( AT ) , ( 5 ) respiratory exchange ratio , ( 6 ) time AT ( 7 ) total time tolerate variable obtain . Anaerobic threshold ( AT ) : At begin exercise , adenosine trisphosphate-creatine phosphate provide immediate energy require working muscle . As exercise continue cardiac output increase provide work muscle increase blood flow . As exercise level rise , workload muscle also rise require blood flow oxygen deliver . The oxygen demand meet increase cardiac output lung ventilation . As exercise continuous become strenuous , muscle demand begin exceed rate oxygen delivery respiratory system . At point main fuel glucose metabolise lactic acid . This dissociate lactate hydrogen ion ( H+ ) result acidosis , marker know Anaerobic Threshold ( AT ) . The common way measure AT non-invasively V-slope method see figure 1 . This explain via follow : As participant begin incremental exercise expire minute volume ( VE ) increase linearly oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) carbon dioxide consumption ( VCO2 ) . H+ produce via anaerobic metabolism buffer bicarbonate ( HCO3- ) produce carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . This washed lung measure via breath breath analysis expire air . As VCO2 rise disproportionately VO2 , allow clinician determine AT ; achieve plot VCO2 VO2 . Linear regression line draw upper low curve point intersection indicate VCO2 increase disproportionately VO2 hence estimate AT . An individual 's aerobic capacity know VO2MAX . The common way measure person VO2 max incremental exercise test either perform motorize treadmill cycle-ergometer , measure millilitre per kilogram per minute ( ml.kg.min ) . The aerobic capacity affect factor gender , genetics , body composition age . A healthy 20-25 year old male average VO2 max 42.5 - 46.4 ml.kg.min , whereas healthy female age average 33 - 36.9 ml.kg.min . There approximately ten percent drop aerobic capacity every decade ( dependent fitness ) . For patient AAA suggest achieve threshold ( AT ) value 10.2 ml.kg.min open repair 8.2 EVAR . They also achieve VO2MAX value 15 ml.kg.min . Values low increase risk postoperative mortality ( within 30 day ) . Whilst numerous study importance CPEX , study date determine Inter Intra reliability test AAA population . Aim : The aim study therefore determine Inter Intra reliability CPEX test cycle- ergometer motorise treadmill patient abdominal aortic aneurysm .</detailed_description>
