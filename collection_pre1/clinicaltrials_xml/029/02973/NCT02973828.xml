	<brief_summary>In radiotherapy high-tech scan x-ray ( CT scan ) take treatment locate tumour ensure radiation hit target . These x-ray expose patient additional radiation quality scan often poor make difficult distinguish tumour normal tissue may uncertainty tumour position due movement shrinkage . To allow uncertainty large margin around tumour also treat , mean large volume normal tissue also receive significant dos radiation , result early late toxicity . MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) good CT scan able tell difference tumour normal tissue expose patient additional radiation . A new machine call MR Linac ( magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerator ) integrate high quality MRI state-of-the-art radiotherapy machine Institute Cancer Research ( ICR ) /The Royal Marsden Hospital ( RMH ) currently installation prototype , one first world . This revolutionary technology potential change way radiotherapy deliver . We hope improve precision accuracy hit target mean reduction margin around tumour lead high cure rate significantly few side effect . Studies require simulate treatment MR Linac use routine clinical practice conduct study , need obtain MRI scan volunteer patient currently undergo treatment . This study involve image MRI healthy volunteer well patient volunteer standard course radiotherapy allow u develop MRI sequence derive MR Linac MR Linac-based research focus clinical application establishment MR-CT MR workflow , treatment adaptation quality assurance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study protocol acquisition MR Linac derive image view MRIgRT patient undergo radiotherapy radical intent site predict benefit MRIgRT ( namely , rectum , cervix , lung , prostate , bladder , breast , brain , oesophagus , head neck , hepato-pancreato-biliary ( HPB ) paediatric abdomino-thoracic cancer ) . These use build database MR image MR Linac-based research focus clinical application establishment MR-CT MR workflow , treatment adaptation quality assurance . The primary aim 1 ) develop MR Linac image sequence suitable see tumour/target normal tissue time radiotherapy 2 ) determine variation image registration tissue contour use MR Linac image . Three stage image development sub-studies include protocol optimisation MR image MR Linac . Consideration give image quality , scan time , IT requirement reconstruction , storage image transfer . These image sub-studies : A ) Non-patient Volunteer Imaging Studies Normal Tissue ( n = 18 - 54 ) . The four anatomical region select studied Head neck , Thorax ( chest wall/breast lung/oesophagus ) , Abdomen Pelvis ( male female ) . Recruitment continue image minimum three consecutive patient use 'exam card ' deem acceptable normal tissue visualisation anatomical site . B ) Patient Volunteer Imaging Studies Normal Tissue ( n = 33 - 66 ) . We develop protocol visualise site specific tumours 11 target area ( brain , oropharynx , oesophagus , lung , chest wall , paediatric abdomen , hepatobiliary tract , bladder , cervix , prostate rectum ) . Patients recruit image baseline minimum one maximum 12 imaging session whilst undergoing routine radiotherapy treatment . Repeat image allow determination protocol robustness . The aim produce image appropriate tumour normal tissue visualisation view direct radiotherapy . Recruitment continue image minimum three consecutive patient use 'exam card ' deem acceptable tumour/target visualisation site . C ) Pathway development study ( n = 66 - 110 ) . Using image exam card establish previous volunteer ( continue fine tune necessary ) , patient volunteer recruit tumour site time 58 - 82 imaging session available . This stage require minimum six patient volunteer recruit tumour site may ( may ) include image acquire previous Stage B study , maximum 10 patient volunteer reach desired number imaging session . Each volunteer undergo minimum two twelve image session ( max 1/day , 3/week ) . The methodology image acquisition follow methodology Stage B . The primary aim establish online offline image-matching use MR Linac view guide radiotherapy treatment undertaken minimal intra inter user variability .</detailed_description>
