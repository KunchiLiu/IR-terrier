	<brief_summary>Circumcision common surgical procedure perform Pediatric Urologists . Ketorolac show efficacy similar morphine multi-modal analgesic regimen without commonly associate adverse effect . This study aim see give ketorolac operation result well pain control . We hypothesize ketorolac result pain control similar morphine low incidence side effect nausea vomit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Pain Outcomes Ketorolac Administration Children Undergoing Circumcision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , randomize , single-blinded study conduct January 2017- December 2017 . A total two group present . Patients plan circumcision surgery initially identify surgeon . Patients randomized treatment ( perioperative ketorolac ) control group ( ketorolac ) . A computer-generated randomized block design program use allocate patient either treatment ( ketorolac ) control ( ketorolac ) group . All child receive 15 mg/kg oral dose acetaminophen prior surgery unless contraindicate . General anesthesia induce sevoflurane via facemask . After establish venous access , laryngeal mask insert , anesthesia maintain 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration ( MAC ) sevoflurane oxygen/air 50/50 mixture . The DPNB nerve block perform pediatric urologist use 23 GA needle insert Buck fascia . Once needle tip position appropriately , negative aspiration test , 0.2mL/kg ( maximum 10mL ) 0.25 % bupivacaine inject small aliquot , intermittent aspiration throughout . In patient , skin incision perform least 5 min placement nerve block . At begin circumcision procedure patient asleep , patient treatment group receive 0.5 mg/kg intravenous dose ketorolac . Patients advise take ibuprofen acetaminophen post-operatively need . Patients ' demographic information , time need perform block , time block onset duration surgery record . The mean arterial pressure , heart rate oxygen saturation , expire sevoflurane end tidal concentration MAC systematically collect pre-operatively , intra-operatively post-operatively recovery room . The primary outcome post-operative pain evaluate use Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ( FLACC ) pain score Wong-Baker FACES scale ascertain nurse research assistant blind anesthetic technique . The usage two scale perform deemed appropriate research assistant . The FLACC scale use child difficulty verbalize pain sleep child ( regardless age ) Wong-Baker FACES scale use patient capable self-assessment . The FLACC score well-established postoperative pain measure use 5 item score 0-2 , validate patient 6 month 7 year age ( 9.10 ) . The Wong-Baker FACES pain scale use post-operatively allows patient select face relate current feeling pain ( 11 ) . These face rat scale 10 . A FLACC Wong-Baker FACES score record every 15 minute first hour every 30 minute 2 hour follow discharge PACU day stay surgical unit . If score find &gt; 3 ( moderate pain 4-6 , severe pain 7-10 ) , patient receive intravenous morphine dose 0.05mg/kg . An additional dose may give 15 minute follow initial dose morphine analgesia inadequate ( score &gt; 4 ) . Postoperatively , child monitor every 15 minute first hour every 30 minute next 2 hour discharge home . Discharge base normal institutional criterion include level awareness , hemodynamic stability absence pain , bleeding , nausea vomiting . Prior discharge , parent provide additional analgesic require home contact 24 hour follow surgery complete parent ' postoperative pain measure ( PPPM ) ( 12 ) . The PPPM well-established post-operative pain assessment tool high inter-rater reliability construct validity , design specifically use parent post-operative care child . The measure include 15 item score 0 1 . The questionnaire complete telephone time correspond 24 hour post-surgical closure . Amount pain analgesia consumption data collect contact parent 24 hour post procedure . As previous study analyze post-operative analgesic effect ketorolac pediatric patient undergo circumcision study act pilot study . A total sample size 30 patient use base previous recommendation pilot study account 20 % attrition . There 15 patient ketorolac ketorolac group . The primary outcome variable average FLACC Wong-Baker FACES pain score hospital stay ( average pain score take every 15 minute first hour every 30 minute thereafter discharge ) . Normality ( use Shapiro-Wilk test ) assess primary outcome variable , guide choice parametric non-parametric statistical analysis ( e.g . unpaired t-test Mann-Whitney U test ) . We also complete statistical analysis ass difference patient characteristic ( e.g . weight , height , age ) pre-op pain score two group . As , Shapiro-Wilk test require assess normality guide test selection . With respect within factor comparison , repeat measure ANOVA analysis post-hoc Bonferroni correction multiple comparison use assess difference pain score within patient receive treatment ( e.g . access whether significant difference pain score occur patient receive ketorolac across time point pain score record ) . An analogous within factor repeat measure ANOVA thus use assess difference pain score collect time point patient receive ketorolac . Significant difference nominal data two group assess use Fisher 's exact test Pearson 's chi-square test association . An independent group expert directly involve conduct study assemble open invitation participate . This board periodically review evaluate accumulate study data participant safety , study conduct progress , , appropriate , efficacy . Furthermore , make recommendation concern continuation , modification , termination trial . The board meet start trial discus protocol , definition quorum , guideline monitor study . Thereafter , board convene often necessary , least annually .</detailed_description>
