	<brief_summary>This study combine two drug ( ruxolitinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor , nilotinib ) attempt eliminate CML ( Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ) stem cell population thus allow deep durable response possible patient CML chronic phase achieve complete hematologic remission ( CHR ) , complete cytogenetic remission ( CCyR ) , major molecular remission ( MMR ) , complete molecular remission ( CMR ) . The study look safety tolerability ruxolitinib combine nilotinib phase I study help establish MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) ruxolitinib combine nilotinib . Once optimal dose ruxolitinib establish phase I set , phase II evaluation seek establish efficacy combination .</brief_summary>
