	<brief_title>Benefit From Chin Down Maneuver Swallowing Performance Self-perception Parkinson 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants Participants PD patient recruit Parkinson´s disease Movement Disorders Clinic Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) , reference hospital , Rio Grande Sul , Brazil . It obtain participant write free inform consent participate research . This study approve hospital central research ethic committee . Inclusion exclusion criterion Patient evaluation It perform cognitive screening consist Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) patient intervention . It also apply instrument Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 ( PDQ-39 ) , translate Portuguese , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . These test apply verify influence cognitive aspect , depression quality life therapeutic process . To evaluate intervention 's effectiveness , evaluation swallow conduct two moment ( intervention ) . Three kind assessment perform : ( 1 ) . Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation swallowing ( FEES ) ; ( 2 ) Clinical evaluation ( 3 ) assessment quality life relate swallowing ( SWALQOL ) . - Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation swallowing ( FEES ) : This objective examination swallowing perform accord follow protocol : First , test prior state secretion nasopharyngeal structure , oropharynx , laryngopharynx . Next , individual receive liquid consistency offer syringe , 3 5ml water edible blue food coloring . For pasty consistency , 3 5ml thickened water provide syringe edible blue food coloring . It offer ¼- water salt biscuit good blue food color ass solid consistency . No anesthetic use examination . The image later analyze otolaryngologist physician , experience dysphagia area . It observe presence thicken posterior laryngeal wall , tremor structure ( base tongue vallecula ) , early escape ( characterize presence food hypopharynx larynx swallow reflex trigger ) , vallecular stasis glossoepiglottic fold pyriform sinus ( characterize accumulation food third swallowing mention structure ) , penetration ( characterize presence food laryngeal vestibule ) , tracheal aspiration ( characterize food intake region locate vocal fold , subglottic region trachea , time swallow ) cough reflex . The alteration classify present absent . The equipment use flexible nasopharyngoscope Maschida ENT-III , 3.2mm , Xerônio Storz light source . - Clinical evaluation Functional Oral Intake Scale ( FOIS ) : clinical evaluation swallowing perform certified speech therapist , previously train apply protocol . All evaluation conduct professional . This assessment purpose check sign symptom oropharyngeal dysphagia . It use solid food consistency ( half portion bread ) liquid ( 100ml water ) evaluate free demand . The analyzed sign symptom : history aspiration pneumonia ; alert state ; interaction attention/ability ; awareness swallow problem ; awareness secretion ; ability manipulate flow ; postural control ; fatigability ; anatomy oral , pharyngeal laryngeal physiology ; orofacial tonus ; oral apraxia ; orofacial sensitivity ; gag pharyngeal contraction ; saliva swallowing ; cough hawk ; swallow apraxia ; oral residue ; delay swallowing reflex ; reduction laryngeal elevation ; wet voice ; multiple swallowing . A total 21 sign symptom evaluate present absent . At end objective clinical evaluation , intake food score accord Functional Oral Intake Scale ( FOIS ) . This scale score level oral food intake patient specific level , 0 ( restrict alternative food pathway ) 7 ( total oral intake restriction ) , aim monitoring patient ' evolution therapeutic process . A translated validated version Brazilian Portuguese use . - The quality Life Swallowing Disorders : The questionnaire Quality Life Swallowing Disorders ( SWAL-QOL ) apply , verify symptom present patient , well influence quality life . This instrument Alpha Cronbach coefficient high 0.80 , except one domain . Thus , present excellent internal consistency short-term reproducibility . It sensitive scale differentiate oropharyngeal dysphagia degree severity . The version translate validated Brazilian Portuguese use . All questionnaire apply wait room . The question possible answer read researcher patient . The questionnaire application perform individually , patient . Intervention Individuals agree participate study allocate one three intervention group : ( 1 ) experimental group ( patient perform chin-down posture maneuver ) , ( 2 ) control group ( PD individual without intervention ) ( 3 ) orientation group ( PD participant receive swallowing orientation ) . 1 . Experimental group ( EG ) ( chin-down posture maneuver group ) : patient receive intervention program consist four weekly individual session 30 minute . In session , perform train Chin-down postural maneuver saliva water . The participant train perform maneuver twice day , swallow saliva , meal , throughout week , home . The participant receive form , record number time perform maneuver home . It allow control adherence , reinforce session importance adherence treatment . Besides , subject receive instruction regard feeding . All instruction , well explanation maneuver , submit patient write document . 2 . Control group ( CG ) ( PD individual without intervention ) : The participant group underwent evaluation swallowing , assessment repeat four week , without intervention period . 3 . Orientations group ( OG ) : individual participate intervention program consist four individual session week , 30 minute . In session , instruction feed perform . The individual receive instruction write document . In session , verify doubts guideline treatment adherence . In group , apply Chin-down postural maneuver . The EG OG intervention use researcher , previously train . After end research , offer CG OG individual swallow therapy perform GE .</detailed_description>
