	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Lenvatinib Treating Metastatic Recurrent Differentiated Thyroid Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate clinical efficacy , indicated rate complete response ( CR ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 , combination therapy pembrolizumab lenvatinib lenvatinib-naive patient progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) . ( Cohort 1 ) II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) addition pembrolizumab patient radioiodine-refractory DTC progressive disease lenvatinib alone . ( Cohort 2 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile toxicity combination therapy pembrolizumab lenvatinib patient progressive DTC . ( Cohort 1 cohort 2 ) II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Cohort 1 cohort 2 ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) pretreatment frequency CD8+ T cell primary and/or metastatic tumor . ( Cohort 1 cohort 2 ) II . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) pretreatment PD-L1 PD-L2 level primary and/or metastatic tumor . ( Cohort 1 cohort 2 ) III . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) pretreatment frequency lymphocytes express CD3 , CD4 , PD-1 , FoxP3 , CD20 , CD163+ macrophage . ( Cohort 1 cohort 2 ) IV . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) phenotype frequency key leukocyte subset ( i.e. , PD-1+ T cell , regulatory T cell [ Tregs ] , myeloid subset ) peripheral blood , 6 18 week therapy , 54 week ( study completion ) , progressive disease ( PD ) , study withdrawal . ( Cohort 1 ) V. To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) PD-1+ T cell functional capacity . ( Cohort 1 ) VI . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) serum anti-thyroglobulin antibody level assess , 18 week therapy . ( Cohort 1 2 ) VII . To correlate tumor response ( RECIST 1.1 ) tumor mutation status . ( Cohort 1 ) VIII . To broadly investigate mechanism response resistance combination therapy , gene expression profile generate frozen biopsy analysis ribonucleic acid-sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) . ( Cohort 1 ) OUTLINE : Patients receive lenvatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 19 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
