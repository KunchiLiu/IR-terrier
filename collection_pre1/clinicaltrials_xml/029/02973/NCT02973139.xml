	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective randomize clinical trial compare two currently accept standard-of-care treatment strategy : Medical thoracoscopy compare instillation intrapleural tissue Plasminogen Activator ( TPA ) human recombinant Deoxyribonuclease ( DNase ) management empyema complex parapneumonic effusion ( CPPE ) adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Pleural infection ( empyema complex parapneumonic effusion ( CPPE ) ) represent one common clinical diagnosis encounter clinical practice United States ( US ) It associate substantial morbidity mortality despite advance medical diagnostic therapeutic strategy . Objective : Compare two standard care treatment : TPA/DNase vs early medical Thoracoscopy Methods : We conduct prospective randomize clinical trial . We plan enroll total 80 patient randomize either Medical Thoracoscopy group Fibrinolytic Therapy group . Follow-up daily hospital discharge 6 12 week outpatient set Primary Outcome : Duration hospital stay intervention Secondary Outcome : Failure rate assign treatment adverse event Potential Outcome Benefit : Determine best strategy treat patient pleural infection</detailed_description>
