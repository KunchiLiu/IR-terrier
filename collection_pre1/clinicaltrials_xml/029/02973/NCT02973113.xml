	<brief_summary>Subjects type lymph node cancer call Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) lymphoproliferative disease ( LPD ) , affect immunity , blood production , involve multiple organ body . Their disease come back go away treatment . The experimental treatment plan consist antibody therapy call `` Nivolumab '' help subject ' T-cells control tumor , special immune system cell call LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes , also new therapy whose side effect well study . Some patient NHL LPD infect virus cause infectious mononucleosis ( call Epstein-Barr virus , EBV ) time diagnosis . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . Investigators want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill cell infect EBV survive blood affect tumor . Investigators use sort therapy treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post-transplant lymphoma good success . These cell call LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( EB-VSTs ) , effective treating disease . These LMP-specific EB-VSTs experimental yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Sometimes possible grow cell ; may last long body give vein thereby limited time fight tumor . With study , investigator aim increase duration time T cell last body effectively fight cancer use nivolumab . Nivolumab FDA approve treatment kind cancer like lung cancer skin cancer call Melanoma . The purpose study find LMP-specific EB-VST cell combination nivolumab safe , learn side effect , see whether therapy may help patient EBV relate lymphoma LPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Epstein Barr Virus Specific T Cells ( EB-VSTS ) , Relapsed/Refractory EBV Positive Lymphoma ( PREVALE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator draw blood subject make LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( EB-VSTs ) lab . Investigators make cell first grow special type cell call dendritic cell ( DCs ) monocytes stimulate T cell . Then add specially produce mixture protein include LMP , EBNA1 , BARF proteins . These used stimulate T cell . As T cell grow , investigator add subject 's cell express protein stimulate . They also add cell call K562 new gene put inside express protein stimulate immune system encourage T cell grow . This stimulation train EB-VSTs kill cell EBV proteins surface . These cell grow frozen . The cell grow lab thaw injected subject 's vein 2-10 minute . Initially , one dose drug nivolumab give one day EB-VST cell infused ( day 0 ) every 2 week total four dos nivolumab . Subjects receive two infusion EB-VST cell . The first infusion give Day 1 second infusion T cell Day 15 . If eligible , subject may receive three additional dos T cell 6-12 week apart additional T cell infusion would precede one dose nivolumab day prior . Subjects medical blood test predetermine time point . Investigators follow subject closely treatment side effect least 1 year subject 's last infusion .</detailed_description>
