	<criteria>1 . A diagnosis Graves ' disease assess physician clinical laboratory finding receive antithyroid therapy . 2 . Quantifiable level TSHR antibody . 3 . Raised level free T3 and/or free T4 ( exceed 15 pmol/L 35 pmol/L respectively ) include undetectable level thyroid stimulate hormone . 4 . HLADRB1*15 , HLA DRB1*03 HLA DRB1*04 positive . 5 . Age 18 65 year inclusive time inform consent . 6 . The subject must willing able give write informed consent must willing comply protocol assessments/procedures . 7 . Male subject must sterile ( biologically surgically ) commit use reliable method birth control duration study least 90 day last dose ATXGD59 . 8 . Female subject child bear potential must : neither pregnant breastfeeding , attempt conceive , use highly effective method contraception define , throughout entire duration study least 90 day last dose ATXGD59 . A serum pregnancy test perform screen visit woman child bear potential . Thereafter urine pregnancy test perform . A positive result exclude woman study immediately . A highly effective method contraception define result low failure rate use consistently correctly implant , injectable , combined oral contraceptive , Intrauterine Devices ( IUDs ) , unless postmenopausal surgically sterilize . Barrier form contraception consider appropriate use combination one method . 1 . Subjects pregnant breastfeed and/or subject postpartum period . 2 .

Treatment AntiThyroid Drugs eg carbimazole within previous 3 month prior Study Day 1 . 4 . Previous treatment radioiodine ( partial complete ) thyroidectomy . 5 . Signs moderate severe orbitopathy include optic nerve compression require steroid and/or clinical activity score &gt; 3 . 6 . Large compressive goitre cause localise symptom difficulty swallow breathe . 7 . Treatment steroid ( administer via oral and/or parenteral route ) adrenocorticotropic hormone exception inhale steroid within three month prior Study Day 1 . 8 . Symptoms sign thyroid storm confusion , pyrexia cause hyperthyroidism . 9 . Significant cardiac disease and/or atrial fibrillation would require urgent treatment thyrotoxicosis . 10 . Prior treatment biological peptidebased therapeutic include rituximab . 11 . Prior use disease relate T cell vaccine peptidetolerising agent treat Graves ' disease . 12 . Detectable level antibody plasma specific peptide within ATXGD59 screen visit . 13 . A history significant drug allergy . 14 . The use investigational drug , participation Clinical Trial within three month prior Study Day 1 . 15 . Treatment cytokine anticytokine therapy within three month prior Study Day 1 . 16 . Inadequate liver function , define total bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal value Screening visit . 17 . Subject significant medical illness psychiatric condition opinion Investigator , would preclude participation study impair ability give inform consent ; clinically apparent autoimmune disease . 18 . Clinically significant illness , determine investigator , within 4 week prior first dose ( Study Day 1 ) ATXGD59 . 19 . Known history active chronic infectious disease disease compromise immune function ( e.g . HIV+ , HTLV1 , Lyme disease , Latent active TB , Hepatitis ) . 20 .
