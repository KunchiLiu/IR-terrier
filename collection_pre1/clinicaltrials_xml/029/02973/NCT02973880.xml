	<detailed_description>Cataract ophthalmic disease usually affect elderly population . Therapy surgical past decade , improvement surgical technique instrument dramatically increase number cataract extraction perform . With improvement surgical technique , Patients ' expectation rise proportionally ; however , difference surgical technique impact severity surgical trauma post-operative recovery . Cataract surgery phaco-emulsification frequently perform intraocular surgical procedure develop world . The amount post-operative ocular pain inflammation play significant role Patient 's perception surgical success . Ocular inflammation , commonly observe cataract surgery , associate breakdown blood-aqueous barrier ( BAB ) result surgical trauma-induced prostaglandin production . Anterior chamber ocular inflammation , clinically assess anterior chamber cell count flare , also common follow cataract surgery . However , post-surgery inflammation frequently view acceptable risk largely outweigh numerous benefit cataract surgery . Advanced surgical technique include phaco-emulsification , capsulorhexis , small clear corneal incision , improve visco-elastics foldable implant help optimize post-surgery result reduce surgical trauma . However , post-surgery inflammation may still occur lead complication corneal edema , intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) spike , posterior capsule opacification cystoid macular edema ( CME ) . The management post-surgery inflammation essential , ensure rapid recovery follow surgery , prevent decrease potential long-term complication , cystoid macular edema . Several ophthalmic product study management post-surgery ocular inflammation pain follow cataract surgery . The two main treatment ocular inflammation topical corticosteroid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAID ) drug . Bromfenac potent inhibitor COX-2 enzyme highly lipophilic molecule rapidly penetrate produce early sustain drug level ocular tissue . Studies show Bromfenac ophthalmic solution equivalent efficacy topical NSAIDs reduce post-operative inflammation control pain . In order decrease intra-surgical post-operative inflammation , become commonplace extend ophthalmic NSAID dose pre-operative use well reduce inflammation minimize risk post-surgery complication particular prevent post-surgery cystoid macular edema . Corticosteroids consider gold standard treatment ocular inflammation , routinely use control post-surgery ocular inflammation . The commonly use route administration corticosteroid agent topical instillation eye drop formulation . Steroids use additional prophylactic treatment high-risk case . After topical administration Dexamethasone , concentration anterior chamber increase decline within hour , necessitate frequent daily instillation eye drop several week . This might associate compliance issue , particularly elderly Patients individual disability . A pharmaceutical formulation allow le frequent administration could therefore attractive alternative . Increase intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) concern use corticosteroid , irrespective route administration . Repeated use topical steroid show induce reversible elevation IOP , especially eyes glaucoma . Although Patients develop increase IOP 3-6 week treatment topical steroid , elevation IOP find early first second week initiation topical instillation steroid . NETILDEX™ eye drop solution , contain Netilmicin Sulfate 4.55 mg ( 3mg/ml ) Dexamethasone Disodium Phosphate 1.32 mg ( 1mg/ml ) , already available Patients . A new ophthalmic gel , preservative-free formulation develop . This new formulation test pre-clinical animal study clinical trial . The new formulation contains Xanthan gum , high molecular mass polysaccharide approve FDA 1969 food product use product viscosity enhancer give product pseudo-plastic characteristic prolong ocular retention time . Its usability ophthalmic preparation well know another product contain Xanthan gum currently available market ( Timolol GFS , Falcon Pharmaceuticals , USA ) . The penetration target tissue Netilmicin Dexamethasone contain NETILDEX ™ eye drop NETILDEX™ ophthalmic gel study pre-clinical study rabbit , result suggest ophthalmic gel formulation increase tissue bioavailability active principle . A clinical study conduct 63 healthy volunteer ( 21 per group ) establish safety ocular tolerability NETILDEX ™ ophthalmic gel , comparison placebo eye drop solution , administer q.i.d . ( 1 drop ) period 14 day . Both formulation tolerate placebo . A statistically significant difference placebo Dexamethasone/Netilmicin observe , expect , intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) value , however none case IOP rise clinically relevant . The purpose trial show administration reduce dose NETILDEX ™ gel 2 time day start day cataract extraction mean phaco-emulsification administer 14 day surgery sufficient obtain non-inferior efficacy NETILDEX ™ eye drop solution administer 4 time day period .</detailed_description>
