Moreover , VAP associate significant increased mortality . In critical ill patient , catabolism increase , anabolism decrease , induce negative nitrogen balance . The consensus optimal nutrition therapy pediatric critical care Asia-Pacific , release 2014 , clearly recommend early enteral nutrition support , begin within 24-48 hour admit PICU , significantly reduce prevalence mortality nosocomial infection . Intermittent enteral feed continual enteral feeding common method enteral nutrition present . There final conclusion association enteral nutrition method VAP . Thus , relationship enteral feeding VAP long controversial issue . There little clinical research correlation enteral nutrition VAP child mechanical ventilation , mostly observational study lack strong evidence . How choose appropriate enteral nutrition remain urgent need PICU clinical work . Therefore , necessary u analyze relationship enteral feeding VAP critically ill child . This study would perform two-year research mechanical ventilate patient PICU four child hospital Shanghai , aim determine relationship different enteral feeding method VAP , collect baseline characteristic data ventilate child , analyze risk factor VAP PICU patient . The result study would contribute improve standard care child undergo mechanical ventilation , reduce lung injury improve prognosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With development advancement modern medical technology , mechanical ventilation become one important supportive treatment method save life critically ill child . Ventilator-associated pneumonia （VAP） common complication mechanical ventilation . It one lead cause hospital-acquired infection PICU . VAP aggravate patient ' condition adverse effect mechanical ventilation . An overseas study report VAP increase 56 % PICU length stay 43 % length hospitalization . Moreover , VAP associate significant increased mortality . Because prevalence mortality VAP vary adult child , also different area , necessary investigate current status VAP local child , contribute clinical prevention treatment decrease mortality . Appropriate nutrition support improve body 's metabolism , promote tissue body function repair , reduce incidence complication . However , inadequate enteral nutrition may cause gastroesophageal reflux aspiration , may lead VAP exacerbate condition . Intermittent enteral feed continual enteral feeding common method enteral nutrition present . The relationship enteral feeding method VAP long controversial issue . There little clinical research correlation enteral feeding VAP child mechanical ventilation , mostly observational study lack strong evidence . How choose appropriate enteral nutrition remain urgent need PICU clinical work . Therefore , necessary u analyze relationship enteral feeding VAP critically ill child . The primary objective study investigate influence intermittent continuous enteral feeding VAP PICUs . The secondary objective collect baseline characteristic data ventilate child , analyze risk factor VAP child . Each patient randomly assign intermittent continuous enteral feeding schedule . Intermittent enteral feeding schedule : feed administer via nasogastric tube le 30 min . Continuous enteral feeding schedule : feed pump deliver via nasogastric tube 24 hour . Data feeding progression , respiratory status incidence VAP collect compare . The study also collect data baseline character , ventilation management , ventilate day time discharge hospital .</detailed_description>
