	<brief_summary>Soft tissue loss proper digital nerve ( PDN ) defect finger result sensory loss finger pulp . Reconstruction complex soft tissue defect continue challenge problem . To resolve problem , combine nerve branch boomerang flap simultaneous repair soft tissue loss PDN defect awkward area . For comparison , also collect consecutive series 32 patient similar injury finger treat use cross finger flap secondary free nerve graft .</brief_summary>
