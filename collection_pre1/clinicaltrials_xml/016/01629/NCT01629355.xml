	<brief_title>Auditory Brainstem Response Diagnostic Tool Schizophrenia Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Within daily clinical work medical specialty , objective diagnostic tool paramount . However , psychiatric field measure lack . Since 1983 method psychoacoustics development hope serve purpose . A recent development auditory brainstem response ( ABR/SD-BERA ) , propose potential diagnostic tool within psychiatry . The ABR diagnostic tool use primarily diagnose sensorineural hearing loss . It detect evoked potential , generate neuronal activity auditory pathway brainstem , within first 10 m follow acoustic stimulation . The potential record surface electrode place forehead mastoid process . The wave pattern record consist seven peak , interpreted respect latency amplitude . Previous study aim associate peak specific anatomical structure . The method SD-BERA development standard ABR . It use wide array acoustic stimulus , include complex sound , instance masking noise . The measuring procedure roughly take 25 minute . Previous study use complex sound compare mentally healthy subject patient suffer schizophrenia , ADHD bipolar disorder show different psychiatric group exhibit specific wave pattern . Aims The aim first study validate previous result identify five ( n=5 ) patient diagnose ADHD , schizophrenia bipolar disorder , compare patient ( n=15 ) healthy , age-matched control . The aim second study present blind study 12 patient schizophrenia 12 patient bipolar disorder ( total n=24 ) compare healthy control ( n=12 ) order evaluate method diagnostic tool clinical healthcare practice .</detailed_description>
