	<brief_summary>Subjects refractory chronic constipation offer two conventional therapeutic strategy : either medical treatment , either surgery ( case medication failure ) . Nevertheless , procedure less invasive surgery could alternative strategy : sacral nerve modulation . This procedure consist stimulate nerve control contraction colon defecation phenomenon . Several open trial suggest sacral nerve modulation may effective reduce constipation relate symptom . The aim randomize clinical trial ass efficacy sacral nerve stimulation patient constipation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Sacral Nerve Modulation Severe Refractory Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence constipation 2-27 % Western country . For patient fail medical treatment ( laxative , biofeedback ) , surgical solution may consider ( subtotal colectomy ) . But result variable puts risk functional sequela . Sacral nerve modulation minimally invasive procedure compare standard surgical support ( colectomy ) reversible , consist two stage . First , 3-week temporary stimulation test allow verify efficacy neuromodulation . If test positive , stimulating electrode definitely implant . Risks related procedure ( infection , pain ) much small associated conventional surgical support . Non comparative study conduct 19 62 patient show 40-73 % implanted patient improvement constipation could benefit permanent implantation good result medium term . The primary objective investigator study evaluate short-term efficacy ( percentage responder 2 month ) sacral nerve modulation treatment severe chronic constipation . This cross-over design , double-blinded , French multicenter clinical trial , include two period : 2 month stimulation ON 2 month stimulation OFF . Between two period , 15-days period `` wash-out '' respect patient OFF mode ( 4.5 month total ) . This period 4.5 month extend follow-up period 7 month patient treat ( stimulation ON ) . If trial show efficiency procedure , patient severe refractory constipation could benefit sacral nerve modulation test consider surgical treatment .</detailed_description>
