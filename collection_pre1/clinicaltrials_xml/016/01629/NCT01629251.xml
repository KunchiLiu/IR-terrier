	<brief_summary>The main focus research development closed-loop system glucose control people type 1 diabetes . After demonstrated safety efficacy overnight closed-loop insulin delivery , extend evaluation closed-loop daytime . Meal-related insulin dose challenge prandial insulin overdose associate occurrence postprandial hypoglycaemia , thus represent confound factor hypoglycaemia free glucose control day . A investigation need evaluate alternative strategy prandial insulin dose . We study eight adolescent type 1 diabetes closed-loop insulin delivery combine either standard reduce insulin dos meal , randomise crossover design . Stable glucose isotope administer collect data model glucose turnover around meal , daily activity overnight . The information provide use glucose isotope would helpful increase understanding physiology glucose turnover facilitate development improve control algorithm . Ultimately study help development closed-loop system match insulin infusion change glucose level real life condition .</brief_summary>
