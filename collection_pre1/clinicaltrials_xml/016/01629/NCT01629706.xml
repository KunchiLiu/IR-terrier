	<brief_title>Determination Cell Population Solution-Induced Corneal Staining ( SICS ) Symptomatic Versus Asymptomatic Lens Wearers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 phase . In Phase 1 , participant wear contact lenses pre-soaked overnight contact lens solution 2 hour 4 hour , separate day . A minimum 7 day separate wear period . Ocular surface cell collect wear period . In Phase 2 , participant wear habitual contact lenses daily wear basis 4 week habitual lens care . Ocular surface cell collect Day 1 Day 28 . Phase 2 include eligible participant complete Phase 1 new participant . A participant consider asymptomatic he/she typically wear contact lenses comfortably least 10 hours/day minimum 5 days/week , symptomatic he/she typically wear contact lens minimum 3 days/week experience ocular discomfort le 6 hour wear . Phase 1 participant eligible participate Phase 2 uninterested continue Phase 2 exit study .</detailed_description>
