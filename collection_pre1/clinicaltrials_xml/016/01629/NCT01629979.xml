	<detailed_description>Introduction : Transplantation harvest autologous epidermal cell vitiligo widely use vitiligo randomize controlled trial literature investigate efficacy noncultured keratinocyte/melanocyte suspension scarce . In addition data regard relationship cellular content epidermal suspension clinical outcome . Aim study : To perform prospective , control , randomize , intra-individual comparative study vitiligo lesion treat epidermal cell transplantation additional narrow-band UVB treatment use epidermal cell suspension characterize cellular level . Study design : Grafting epidermal cell : A superficial skin shave excision obtain pigment skin use dermatome . A cell suspension obtain trypsinisation . Vitiligo skin dermabraded Erbium : Yag laser local anaesthesia . The cell suspension spread dermabraded skin area fix dressing . Keratinocyte , melanocyte count perform aliquot cell suspension . One symmetrical patch vitiligo choose control leave untreated . Narrow-band UVB treatment : Four week transplantation epidermal cell , graft control patch treat Narrow-band UVB . Treatment perform 2 time week . Narrow-band UVB treatment perform least 3 month 24 treatment . Evaluation treatment success : The grade pigmentation lesion evaluate clinically , photograph . The clinical rating perform follow : 0 = repigmentation ; 1 = 1-25 % repigmentation ; 2 = 26 50 % repigmentation ; 3 = 51 75 % repigmentation ; 4 = 76 100 % repigmentation . The evaluation photograph perform blinded physician engage treatment phase study . In addition surface vitiligo patch trace transparent sheet monitor planimetry .</detailed_description>
