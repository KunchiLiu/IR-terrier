	<brief_summary>This study prospective , open label , randomize , comparative study . Comparing efficacy adalimumab immunomodulator therapy ( i.e . 6-mercaptopurine , 6-MP ) , maintain remission post-operative CD patient , high risk disease recurrence . Patient assessment efficacy conduct interval endoscopic surveillance 24 52 week . Patients adalimumab arm , show endoscopic remission 52 week therapy , re-randomized either maintain adalimumab therapy additional 52 week conclude therapy . A third endoscopic assessment patient conduct 104 week . The investigator expect substantial increase endoscopic , well clinical remission rate patient adalimumab therapy .</brief_summary>

Patients may receive antiTNFagents ( i.g . infliximab adalimumab ) previously Patients may receive corticosteroid , 6MP/AZA , methotrexate , mesalamine prior surgery . Antibiotics , mesalamine , must discontinue within screening/baseline 4 week period . Patients steroid may enrol long steroid taper . Remission define CDAI ≤ 150 . Women childbearing potential , men , must use medically acceptable method contraception [ surgical sterilization , IUD , hormonal preparation , double barrier method ( e.g . condom diaphragm , spermicide ) ] throughout study period 6 month receive last injection . Screening lab result must within prespecified limit : Hemoglobin ≥ 8.8 g/dl ; SGOT/SGPT &lt; 3 X upper limit normal ; Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 X 109/L &amp; lymphocyte cont ≥ 0.5 X 109/L Must document PPD ≤ 5 mm , patient take steroid , within month randomization , take immunomodulators 2 month prior randomization . Other patient must document PPD ≤ 10 mm prior randomization . PPD must preform documented appoint member investigatory stuff . Patients must normal chest radiograph ( posterioranterior lateral view ) , read certified radiologist , within 3 month prior randomization . Commitment adhere study protocol requirement Negative stool culture enteric pathogen ( Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , Ova &amp; parasite ) , negative clostridium difficile toxin assay stool . Patients able selfinject designee healthcare professional inject study medication appropriate interval . Patient 's long standing ( &gt; 5Y ) , well recently diagnose Crohn 's disease , eligible show radiologic ( i.e . CT enterography , MR enterography , small bowel follow ) evidence , well laboratory ( i.e . CRP , platelet level , fecal calprotectin , ESR ) evidence active inflammatory process within 3 month period prior qualify surgery evidence macroscopic inflammatory disease surgical margin else ware , accord surgeon Patients discontinue anti TNFalpha agent due loss efficacy tolerability issue . Patients temporary ileostomy . Patients longstanding quiescent CD undergo surgery treatment fibrostenotic lesion , without active inflammatory disease process resect segment . Any following medication take within 3 month prior randomization : cyclosporine , tacrollimus , mycophenolate mofetil , investigational antiinflammatory agent . Medication target reduction TNFalpha ( infliximab , golimumab , cetrolizumb pegol , etanercept ) , natalizumab , FDA approve biological agent may administer index surgery .
