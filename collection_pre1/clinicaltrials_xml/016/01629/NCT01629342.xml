	<brief_summary>STANDARDIZED PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES MEASURED BY ACCELEROMETERS Background aim : Physical activity may assess several different method . However , use accelerometer direct method available real-time measurement . The piezoelectric element accelerometer record electric voltage movement transcribe Activity Counts ( AC ) . Few study use Actical accelerometer assess standardized physical activity applicable patient hospital set . No previous study apply Actical accelerometer wrist ankle standardized activity . The aim study record AC different standardized activity frequently do patient hospitalize acute ischemic stroke . Methods : Patients discharge since February 2012 transient ischemic attack invite participate study schedule June-September 2012 ( nexpected=25 ) . All participant wear 5 accelerometer ( Actical ) , one wrist ankle one hip . Standardized physical activity include : - treadmill walk ( 5 minute , 1 4km/h ) - staircase walking ( 1 floor , normal pace ) - cycling fix load ( 5 minute ) - stand sit position sit ( x5 ) - stand supine position - turning leave right back lie bed - raise outstretched arm 90Â° ( x5 , stand position ) - eating ( 5 minute , sit position ) - drinking glass water - sleeping ( 6 hour )</brief_summary>
