	<brief_summary>The CPAP trial 3-arm parallel design randomize sham-controlled trial . Participants randomly assign equal allocation one three treatment : CPAP 10 cm H2O ( high ) vs. CPAP 5 cm H2O ( medium ) vs. CPAP Sham ( less 1 cm H2O , Low ) . The treatment period 12 week airways reactivity assess baseline , 6 12 week treatment 2 week washout .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well establish failure rhythmically apply strain airway smooth muscle lead change biomechanics smooth muscle characterize shortened rest length increase sensitivity pharmacologic constrictor . Patients asthma physiologic airway characteristic recapitulate condition - increase airway tone increase sensitivity methacholine . It underlying hypothesis asthma , although may initiate allergic airway inflammation , promote decrease tidal force fluctuation recumbent sleep . If true , treatment increase tidal force fluctuation airways reverse abnormality . One treatment increase tidal force fluctuation continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . CPAP prevent fall end expiratory lung volume prevents closure airways dependent region lung thereby permit stress tidal breathe apply strain airway . Preliminary data 15 asthmatic show 1 week 10cm H₂O nocturnal CPAP associate remarkable 2.7-fold increase concentration methacholine cause 20 % fall FEV₁ ( PC20 ) . The objective study conduct randomize , sham-controlled , multicenter study 5 10 cm H₂O CPAP order verify finding ; assess effect nocturnal CPAP airways reactivity ; determine durability effect 12 week ; assess safety , tolerability adherence treatment ; explore clinically meaningful benefit . The study conduct 18 center American Lung Association-Asthma Clinical Research Centers ( ALA-ACRC ) Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) Johns Hopkins University . A substudy High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) also conduct subset ACRC clinic . A total 54 subject ( 18 per arm ) randomize main study voluntarily enrol substudy compare structural change airways across treatment group correlate structural change physiological change . A total two visit conduct . HRCT Visit 1 perform randomization main CPAP study , prior initiation CPAP . HRCT Visit 2 perform week 10 12 CPAP , different day prior methacholine challenge testing.Two CT scan perform different lung volume visit ( Total 4 scan study duration ) . The first volume Total Lung Capacity ( TLC ) , follow another CT scan Functional Residual Capacity ( FRC ) .</detailed_description>
