	<brief_summary>Barth syndrome ( BTHS ) disorder characterize heart failure , exercise intolerance skeletal muscle weakness . Preliminary evidence demonstrate endurance exercise training significantly improve exercise tolerance BTHS . Because endurance exercise train target metabolic pathway adversely affected BTHS , investigator hypothesize resistance training may improve exercise tolerance BTHS type train target different metabolic pathway endurance exercise . Therefore , overall objective pilot/feasibility/proof-of-concept proposal collect preliminary data follow hypothesis : Supervised resistance exercise training ( 3x/wk , 45min , 12 wks ) improve exercise tolerance , heart function , muscle strength quality life , find safe adolescent young adult BTHS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Barth syndrome ( BTHS ) X-linked disorder characterize severe mitochondrial dysfunction , cardiomyopathy , skeletal muscle weakness exercise intolerance . Preliminary evidence group demonstrate 12-week endurance ( i.e . aerobic ) exercise train program increase exercise tolerance modestly ( ~5 % ) participant BTHS effect heart skeletal muscle function . Other population , include non-BTHS heart failure , appear receive great benefit endurance exercise training ( e.g . ~15-25 % increase exercise tolerance ) BTHS . The blunted effect endurance exercise training BTHS may due inherent pathogenesis BTHS : genetic mitochondrial dysfunction type I ( oxidative &gt; glycolytic capacity ) muscle fiber . Endurance exercise training typically result increase mitochondrial density enzyme function ( primarily type I muscle fiber ) population ; however , BTHS , due maternally inherited mitochondrial dysfunction , endurance exercise training may result generation impaired mitochondrion thus limit beneficial effect endurance training exercise tolerance . Thus , may beneficial target type II ( glycolytic &gt; oxidative capacity ) muscle fiber exercise train attempt increase exercise tolerance BTHS . Indeed , previous evidence non-BTHS heart failure show resistance exercise training ( RET ) increase exercise tolerance , skeletal muscle strength , heart function improve quality life individual . Currently unknown RET effective improving variable BTHS focus proposal . Establishing safety efficacy RET BTHS could lead clinical recommendation regular RET instead combination endurance exercise train standard care treatment individual BTHS . Therefore , overall objective pilot/feasibility/proof-of-concept proposal collect preliminary data follow hypothesis : Supervised RET ( 3x/wk , 45min , 12 wks ) diet standardization ( meet least minimum RDA recommendation adolescents/young adults- 52-56 g protein/day ) protein supplementation ( whey protein isolate , 42 g/day , Unjury Medical Quality Protein , Reston , VA ) improve exercise tolerance , leave ventricular function , muscle strength quality life , find safe adolescent young adult BTHS . In addition , preliminary data suggest impaired protein metabolism skeletal muscle atrophy BTHS . Typically , population , whole-body skeletal muscle protein synthesis increase RET ; however , unclear BTHS . Thus , secondary aim , examine effect RET whole-body protein metabolism BTHS . We aim address hypothesis leave ventricular function , skeletal muscle strength , body composition , exercise tolerance , whole-body protein metabolism measurement baseline follow 3 month supervise RET program 3 participant BTHS ( age 15-30 yr ) . Supervised RET program uniformly design , individualize perform physical therapy cardiac rehabilitation facility near participant 's home . Protein supplementation ( whey protein isolate , 42 g/day ) ingest participant conjunction RET program . Nutritional status evaluate baseline , mid-training ( 6-weeks ) post-training plasma level pre-albumin amino acid profile . Left ventricular function examine use 2-D , Doppler tissue Doppler echocardiography , skeletal muscle strength measure use isotonic isokinetic dynamometry , body composition use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , exercise tolerance measure use grade exercise test indirect calorimetry , whole-body protein metabolism stable-isotope tracer methodology mass spectrometry , quality life measure Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire . We expect find RET safe BTHS , effectively improve cardiac function , skeletal muscle strength mass , whole-body protein synthesis quality life . Preliminary data proposal use large federal association grant application examine cardiovascular , musculoskeletal protein metabolic effect RET BTHS .</detailed_description>
