	<brief_summary>Background : - Several type blood cancer associate poor outcome include high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . Many people MDS , CMML , AML candidate standard treatment . New type treatment need cancer . - Clofarabine lenalidomide anticancer drug . The first damage cancer cell body . The second alter blood supply abnormal cell affect immune system attack cell . These drug previously test treatment MDS leukemia . However , tried combination MDS , CMML , AML . Researchers want see drug safe effective type cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness clofarabine lenalidomide people high-risk MDS , CMML , AML . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age high-risk MDS , CMML , AML . - Participants must candidate standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood bone marrow sample collect . - Participants 5 day treatment clofarabine . It give vein inpatient hospital stay . If serious side effect infusion , participant continue treatment outpatient . - After 28 day , participant bone marrow biopsy check response treatment . - After biopsy , participant start lenalidomide treatment . Half participant take drug 28 day ( one treatment cycle ) . The half take 56 day ( two cycle ) . More blood test biopsy use monitor treatment . - If serious side effect disease become worse , participant may keep take lenalidomide low dose 12 cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) hetereogeneous myeloid malignancy associate poor prognosis . Due advance age medical comorbidities , majority MDS , CMML , AML patient candidate potentially curative standard treatment allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) intensive chemotherapy ( ICT ) . New therapeutic approach improve response rate , less toxicity , extend survival clearly need high risk MDS AML patient . Clofarabine myelosuppressive , second generation purine nucleoside analogue show meaningful efficacy variable dosing level high risk MDS AML patient favorable toxicity profile compare intensive chemotherapy . Lenalidomide oral structural analogue thalidomide complex mechanism action include immunomodulatory , anti-angiogenic , direct cytotoxic effect well-established treatment MDS show agent single efficacy high dos AML . Lenalidomide therapeutic benefit AML great patient low present total leukocyte circulate blast count . We hypothesize initial cytoreductive effect clofarabine may augment effectiveness subsequent lenalidomide therapy create favorable immunologic milieu patient eligible lenalidomide maintenance therapy . This open-label , single institution phase I trial evaluate sequential combination IV clofarabine oral lenalidomide treatment high risk MDS , CMML , AML . Subjects receive single course IV clofarabine ( 5 milligram per meter square per day time 5 ) cytoreduction . This follow oral lenalidomide consolidation dose escalation 25 mg daily 21/28 day 1 cycle first cohort 50 mg daily 28/28 day 2 cycle fourth cohort . In absence dose limit toxicity disease progression , Subjects receive lenalidomide maintenance , start dose 10 mg daily 28 day cycle , dose adjustment , 12 cycle . The overall objective determine safety sequential therapy clofarabine lenalidomide subject high risk MDS , CMML , AML . The primary study endpoint toxicity profile novel treatment combination cohort . Secondary endpoint include characterization response duration , overall survival , feasibility maintenance lenalidomide therapy respond subject .</detailed_description>
