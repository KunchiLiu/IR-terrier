	<brief_summary>Background : - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease common form liver disease United States . It include many condition . Researchers want study fatty liver disease look people liver cirrhosis . They also want look people list liver transplant . Genetic study may provide information cause condition . Objectives : - To study possible genetic cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Eligibility : - Individuals age non-alcoholic fatty liver disease related condition . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants provide blood sample genetic testing . Liver tissue transplant biopsy may also study . - Participants may also ask image study liver . This image study may x-ray magnetic resonance imaging . - No treatment provide part research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) common form liver disease United States . It include wide spectrum condition benign hepatic steatosis cirrhosis liver failure . Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) term describe specific histological characteristic liver inflammation seem determinant step progression NAFLD cirrhosis liver failure . The overall purpose study increase understand genetic background pathophysiology NAFLD detail review physical , radiologic pathology characteristic , available . We perform genetic analysis know candidate gene assess inheritance evaluation unaffected relative . Most patient see hepatologists transplant center hepatology clinic across country . A subset patient family may see NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Although liver biopsy necessary make diagnosis NASH , patient radiologic evidence fatty liver and/or cirrhosis cause rule eligible participate . 2 . Patients already undergone liver transplantation confirm diagnosis NAFLD cryptogenic cirrhosis also eligible participate . 3 . Depending willingness participate , subject may enroll DNA laboratoryonly clinicalonly . However , conserve resource meet study objective , subject know pathogenic mutation give priority selection extensive clinical study . 4 . Direct blood relative ( typically parent sibling ) affect individual NAFLD associate condition also eligible participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . 2 . Pregnant woman . Although fatty liver cirrhosis sometimes diagnosed pregnancy , unclear present diagnose develop complication pregnancy . Additionally energy metabolism change pregnancy lactation may confound analysis . If condition persist pregnancy diagnosis NAFLD clearly establish , patient refer study . 3 . We review clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude case clearly NAFLD related direct research interest ( e.g . fatty liver induce chronic alcohol use , infectious cause , drugrelated , toxinrelated ) . This almost never happen . However , environmental factor may contribute multifactorial etiology hepatic change , may exclude case .</criteria>
