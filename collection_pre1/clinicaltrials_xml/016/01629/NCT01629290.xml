	<brief_summary>This study cross-over single blind clinical study evaluate vitro fluoride release three different brand 5 % NaF varnish . Subjects recruit University Michigan School Dentistry participate 15 minute clinical session begin study arm , follow 6 saliva collection recall . During session fluoride varnish placebo apply teeth , subsequent salivary sample take 1 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour application . All subject receive 3 commercially available varnish , placebo varnish . Between application minimum 2 week wash-out period . The goal study determine different formulation varnish lead differ amount fluoride release . Despite similar concentration NaF ( 5 % ) , vitro data suggest may differ amount fluoride release . Determining fluoride release varnish vivo important assess safety efficacy product . Specific Aims 1 . Determine concentration fluoride available oral cavity different time period application three different 5 % NaF varnish measure unstimulated human saliva . 2 . Compare different pattern fluoride release varnish compare fluoride concentration saliva corresponding time period . 3 . Evaluate validity vitro model use measure fluoride release varnish . Percentage difference fluoride release vivo vitro data obtain product compare .</brief_summary>
