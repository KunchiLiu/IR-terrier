	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine test-retest inter-rater reliability concurrent validity two iPhone goniometric application measurement active shoulder external rotation compare standard manual goniometer . The scientific hypothesis study follow : 1 . There significant Pearson correlation ( &gt; .8 ) demonstrate test-retest reliability tool 1st 2nd round test assessed novice tester . 2 . There significant intra-class correlation coefficient ( &gt; .8 ) demonstrate inter-rater reliability novice tester experience tester three tool . 3 . There significant Pearson correlation ( &gt; .8 ) demonstrate concurrent validity standard goniometer photo capture application , standard goniometer accelerometer-based application photo capture application accelerometer-based app . assessed novice tester .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine test-retest inter-rater reliability concurrent validity two iPhone goniometric application measurement active shoulder external rotation compare standard manual goniometer . This research do determine reliable , valid innovative technological way measure active range motion . Four tester ( three entry-level doctoral student physical therapy one two experienced physical therapist ) measure currently enrol physical therapy doctoral student . The two experience physical therapist principle investigator list investigator Physical Therapist . Two separate iPhone application ( DrGoniometer , base photo capture GetMyROM , base iPhone 's internal accelerometer ) standard manual goniometer use measure participant . All potential participant receive cover letter describe study via email . If student interested participate report test room ( wear tank top ( male female ) ask remove top ( male ) ) one schedule test time . All test occur laboratory room TWU-Houston campus . The participant ask review sign inform consent form . Any question relate study specifically ask time may ask time duration study . The primary investigator co-investigator assign confidential participant number participant time . Next participant ask complete demographic form . If participant answer `` yes '' question 4 , 5 , 6 7 , he/she eliminate study ask participate . At time , participant randomly assign test table 1 , 2 3 ( three table follow basic procedure participant assess table 's assign instrument first ) . Also , side testing ( left right ) randomly select . For example , participant may randomly assign table 1 ( right shoulder ) . The participant report table 1 , iPhone DrGoniometer station ... therefore measure tool first . All tester ( novice expert ) blind outcomes measure . Tester 1 ( novice ) evaluate active right shoulder external rotation range motion ( ROM ) iPhone DrGoniometer piece tape cover measurement reading . Tester 1 hand iPhone blind recorder , remove tape , record measurement , replace tape hand iPhone back Tester 1 . Then participant measure GetMyROM ( novice 2 ) standard goniometer ( novice 3 ) random order . Tape also place measurement iPhone GetMyROM standard goniometer manner use DrGoniometer . Next , skilled tester measure participant instrument use assign table . The participant stay assign table duration test . Now participant ask stand move around return table 2nd round testing . At least fifteen minute initial testing , three initial novice tester repeat measurement previous order . All measurement time test first measurement record blind investigator ( recorder ) enter password protect computer password protect Excel file know primary investigator . The file computer lock primary investigator 's office data collection actively take place . The data link participant number participant 's name know primary investigator record investigator . The iPhones link internet test image delete data record . The data record Excel data printout . After data collection session , data enter file electronically . Measurement Shoulder External Rotation : This study follow standard measurement test procedure assess shoulder external rotation . The participant ask wear either tank-top ( female male ) shirt ( male ) . The participant lie back pad plinth ( table ) . The participant ask place test shoulder approximately 90 degree abduction ( away body ) elbow flex ( bent ) 90 degree . The forearm place neutral midway pronation/supination ( long axis rotation ) approximately 2/3rds proximal entire humerus support table . A towel place humerus elbow approximately level shoulder . In order achieve position , participant instruct via follow script : 1 . Lie back plinth . 2 . Move edge plinth towards . 3 . Let position arm put towel . 4 . Bring arm back towards table , external rotation , feel like ca n't go far 5 . Hold position . For standard goniometer measurement , axis goniometer place center olecranon stationary arm goniometer perpendicular floor move arm bisect ulna towards ulnar styloid process . For DrGoniometer , photo take participant end normal active ROM amount range motion calculate use app . For GetMyROM , iPhone place perpendicular ground , determine tester , edge iPhone place caudal border ulna . Expected normal range motion approximately 90 degree external rotation . The tester watch movement substitution : elbow extension ( straighten ) , scapular elevation , tilt protraction . If tester notice compensatory movement pattern , participant ask return neutral repeat movement without compensation . 3 Three different iPhones use . These iPhones belong investigator . They iPhone 4 version . All iPhone wireless 3G connection disable prior data collection order reduce potential loss confidentiality . All iPhones use version application perform updates application . All iPhones version software update software iPhone study . All iPhones password protect order reduce potential loss confidentiality . At end test session , one PT investigator assure photo delete prior reestablish connectivity internet . In addition , investigator sign confidentiality statement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Current graduate student Texas Woman 's University . Must enrol DPT graduate program Physical Therapy Houston campus . The participant exclude pain shoulder day test , less 90 degree active passive shoulder abduction , less 90 degree active passive elbow flexion , previous surgery procedures either shoulder identify selfreport reason perform active external rotation shoulder .</criteria>
