	<brief_title>Risk Factors Sternal Wound Infection After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep sternal wound infection coronary artery bypass graft dangerous complication prolongs hospital stay , increase morbidity mortality , increase cost care . As risk factor surgical site infection , risk index report NNIS ( national nosocomial infection surveillance ) , Euroscore , Society thoracic surgeon risk score currently use . However , various performance report regard index score system , many factor need index score system , need develop simple risk factor well performance . We focus differential blood cell count , neutrophil lymphocyte count relate degree surgical invasion , inflammatory response . Previous study report neutrophilia lymphopenia relate postoperative infection . Therefore , try evaluate performance preoperative postoperative blood cell differential count risk factor sternal wound infection coronary artery bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
