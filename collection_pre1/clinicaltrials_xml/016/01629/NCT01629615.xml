	<brief_title>A Trial BKM120 ( PI3K Inhibitor ) Patients With Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized , open-label , multicenter , single-arm exploratory study single agent BKM120 treatment metastatic triple negative breast cancer patient . Patients first undergo screening , tumor measurement collection available tumor block primary tumor and/or metastatic site . Available tumor block require patient per inclusion criterion . Analysis tumor block use correlation predictive marker clinical response order define potential subpopulation benefit BKM120 . Following confirmation eligibility criterion , subject enrol . BKM120 administer 100mg dose , orally , daily , continuous schedule . A treatment cycle define 28 day purpose schedule procedure evaluation . Treatment BKM120 continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity precludes treatment , and/or discontinuation treatment investigator patient decision .</detailed_description>
