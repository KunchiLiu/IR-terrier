	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn dose radiation tumor surround healthy tissue could increase use intensity-modulated photon therapy ( IMRT ) intensity-modulated proton beam therapy ( IMPT ) . In Phase I study , researcher want find high tolerable dose IMPT IMRT give tumor . In Phase II , researcher want learn IMPT help control disease compare standard proton therapy combine standard chemotherapy . Participants also receive standard chemotherapy . Proton therapy photon therapy type radiation therapy design use beam proton photon particle ( similar get x-ray ) send radiation inside body tumor . In IMPT IMRT , amount strength proton photon adjust accord size , shape , thickness tumor . In study , tumor receive high dose adjust energy scan time proton photon , call simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) . The treatment do image guidance . This new type radiation design give high standard dose treatment tumor . It also design focus treatment tumor avoid affect healthy tissue around tumor much standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 3 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 100 participant enrol Phase II . If participant enrol Phase I portion , dose radiation therapy receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level radiation therapy . Each new group receive high dose radiation therapy group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose radiation therapy find . If participant enrol Phase I portion , randomly assign ( flip coin ) receive either IMRT IMPT . Participant equal chance assign either group . If participant enrol Phase II portion , randomly assign ( flip coin ) receive either IMRT IMPT . Participant equal chance assign either group . For IMRT IMPT , participant receive high tolerable dose tolerate phase 1 portion trial . Radiation Therapy Administration : Participant first go standard radiation treatment planning procedure , call marking session . This include PET/CT , MRI , CT scan lung . A cradle make hold participant treatment position . After mark session , radiation plan make . Receiving IMRT IMPT SIB treatment similar way CT scan perform . Participant lie table treatment machine rotate around without touch body . Participant receive 6 week photon proton therapy give 1 time day , 5 day week ( Monday Friday ) . Each daily treatment take 20-30 minute complete . Most time use position participant correctly machine turn . The actual time use give radiation take 3-5 minute day . Chemotherapy : Participant also receive chemotherapy part standard care disease . The drug participant receives depend type disease study doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant sign separate consent form receive drug include potential risk benefit , well give . Symptom Questionnaire : Participant complete symptom questionnaire . This do following schedule . - chemoradiation being - week chemoradiation - week 16 week chemoradiation complete - every week Week 16 12 week chemoradiation complete - participant 's follow-up visit The symptom questionnaire take 10 minute complete time . Study Visits : At least 1 time week chemoradiation ( chemotherapy radiation ) : - Participant physical exam . - Participant ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Treatment : Participant may continue receive study treatment 6 week . Participant longer able receive study treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-Up Visits : After participant complete chemoradiation , study staff call 1 time month ask symptom may 6 month chemoradiation . Each phone call last 10 minute . Participant first follow-up visit 4-8 week complete chemoradiation . Participant additional follow-up visit every 3-4 month . At participant 's first second follow-up visit : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant PET/CT scan SPECT scan check lung heart study doctor think need . The remain follow-up visit include standard test , physical exam , procedure doctor think need . For example , PET/CT SPECT scan repeat time study doctor think need . This investigational study . Photon therapy IMRT proton therapy IMPT deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . It investigational use SIB IMRT IMPT learn good way give high dose treatment tumor damage much healthy tissue around . Up 100 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function , assess following : *Hemoglobin &gt; /=9.0 g/dL *Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /=1,500/mm3 *Platelet count &gt; /=100,000/mm3 *Total bilirubin &lt; /=1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) *Alanine aspartate transaminase ( ALT AST ) &lt; /=2.5 time ULN ( &lt; /= 5 x ULN patient liver involvement ) *Creatinine &lt; /=1.5 time ULN 11 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) . The approved consent form attach protocol . 1 . Prior radiotherapy anatomic region would result overlap radiation dose distribution critical structure ( esophagus , heart , spinal cord , brachial plexus ) 2 . T4 tumor direct invasion esophagus , spinal cord , major blood vessel , heart 3 . GTV motion &gt; 5 mm fourdimensional compute tomography ( 4D CT ) scan without respiratory management use gate breathholding 4 .
