	<brief_summary>The study propose enroll male subject affect Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia ( XLHED ) . The sweat duct image acquire CE mark skin-imaging device sweat rate measure use CE mark pilocarpine iontophoresis collection system . The technology image sweat duct measurement maximal sweat rate use safely without adverse event prior study involve HED/XLHED subject . Furthermore , study assess feasibility develop non-invasive screening tool enable detection clinical sign XLHED base analysis two dimensional frontal photograph .</brief_summary>
