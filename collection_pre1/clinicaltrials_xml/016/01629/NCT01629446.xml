	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine mass balance single oral dose 14C labeled lofexidine . Study US WorldMeds Reference Number USWM-LX1-1003 , conduct July August 2011 , single-center , open-label , two-period , two-treatment , randomized sequence study determine mass balance absolute bioavailability single oral dose 14C-labeled lofexidine compare single intravenous dose lofexidine . During conduct study , deficiency occur collection processing urine sample subject administer oral dose 14C-labeled lofexidine . In study USWM-LX1-1003-1 , six male subject dose 14C labeled lofexidine oral solution order provide accurate data mass balance portion study . Male subject successfully participate complete study USWM-LX1-1003 enrol first . Additional male subject enrol need provide cohort 6 subject . Additional provision ensure adequate urine collection implement site utilized USWM-LX1-1003-1 . All blood draw pharmacokinetic analysis radioanalysis , urine fecal collection interval , occur time point USWM-LX1-1003-1 USWM-LX1-1003 . To study absorption , distribution , metabolism , elimination ( ADME ) , trace amount 14C compound quantified use accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) . As form isotope ratio atom counter achieve low detection limit type mass spectrometry , AMS provide quantitative sensitivity towards 14C label compound low attomole ( 10-18 ) level . This high degree sensitivity enable detection compound small specimen and/or tissue administration dose chemically radiochemically small ( microdose level ) . At radioactive dose give ( approximately 280 nCi ; 10.36 kBq ) total radiation exposure participant within level background radiation exposure occur naturally order magnitude ( 1000 fold reduction average ) level typical human metabolism study use 14C tracer .</detailed_description>
