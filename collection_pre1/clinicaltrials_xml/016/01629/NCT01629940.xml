	<detailed_description>As first exploratory objective study , propose obtain facial photograph use test computer algorithm recognize male high risk XLHED . While 3D facial profiling report HED , technology meet ease-of-use criterion universal screen tool . FDNA ( www.fdna.com ) , software company expertise area facial recognition , collaborate Sponsor algorithm development base 2D photograph require special photographic technology . All male risk diagnosis XLHED attending 2012 NFED Family Conference eligible participate . A short medical questionnaire verify clinical presentation , request provide baby photograph take 1 month age ( return study completion ) , frontal facial photograph take time study conduct . The anonymized photograph transmit FDNA analysis . A limited number unaffected control recruit 2012 NFED Family Conference photography study , addition control data already available FDNA database . As second exploratory objective , subset affect male age 5 25 year option blood draw set laboratory study assess nutritional status . HED-affected patient general ( include XLHED ) report evidence growth restriction ( weight height ) age range without clear mechanistic evidence . A screening panel nutritional laboratory test design collaboration expert field University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) . Anonymized sample analyze UCSF .</detailed_description>
