	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal investigator ongoing research development closed-loop system insulin delivery , help people type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) attain tight glucose control avoid risk hypoglycaemia . The main component system continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) , insulin pump computer-based 'model-predictive algorithm ' , compute amount insulin give insulin pump accord CGM value . In study perform thus far efficacy safety closed-loop glucose control evaluate overnight prolonged period time include day-time child adolescent T1D . The result show closed-loop improve control blood glucose prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia , compare conventional insulin pump therapy . The objective current study test performance closed-loop , evaluate system common non-compliant behaviour administration meal insulin dose adolescent T1D . This pave way comprehensive use close loop system control glucose level T1D various `` real-life mimicking '' common circumstance . The present study adopts open-label , randomise , 2 period cross-over design whereby closed-loop insulin therapy compare conventional insulin pump therapy 12 adolescent T1D . Participants age 12 18 year randomise two 24 hour study clinical research facility , glucose level control either computer-based closed-loop algorithm ( intervention arm ) conventional insulin pump therapy ( control arm ) . On occasion , participant under-estimate omit meal-related insulin dose evening-meal lunch , respectively . The study take place Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility ( WTCRF ) , Cambridge participant recruit paediatric diabetes clinic England .</brief_summary>
