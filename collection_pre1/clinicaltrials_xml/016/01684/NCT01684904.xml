	<brief_summary>The goal phase II study investigate feasibility , toxicity efficacy regimen incorporate proven systemic regimen , carboplatin /paclitaxel , conformal proton modality , follow definitive surgery . In combined-modality trial date , chemotherapy regimen include cisplatin , usually conjunction 5-fluorouracil . In design regimen , investigator attempt improve standard cisplatin/5-fluorouracil regimen several way . First , full-dose paclitaxel add regimen . This agent activity advance esophageal cancer also potent radiosensitizer . Second , substitution carboplatin cisplatin result reduced toxicity various combination regimens similar use CROSS trial allow easy administration outpatient setting.4 Third , localize esophageal cancer , dose distribution pattern achievable proton beam could potentially offer important clinical advantage relative achievable x-ray ( photon ) .19 Based , investigator believe study conduct radiation modality offer best dosimetry achievable institution .</brief_summary>
