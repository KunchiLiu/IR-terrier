	<brief_summary>ClarityIQ novel X-ray imaging technology , combine advance real-time image noise reduction algorithm , state-of-the-art hardware reduce patient entrance dose significantly . This realize anatomy-specific optimization full acquisition chain ( grid switch , beam filtering , pulse width , spot size , detector image processing engine ) every clinical task individually . Furthermore , small focal spot size short pulse use , know positively influence image quality . The final effect clinical image quality investigate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fluoroscopically guided procedure associate risk radiation injury skin , cause high peak skin dose . The increasingly complex nature many intervention perform require use significant amount radiation completion . Of particular relevance dose reduction concern obese patient , additional radiation often necessary obtain sufficient diagnostic quality , well patient suffer chronic total coronary occlusion ( CTO ) , long procedure extend radiation time contrast usage common . In order introduce dose reduction technology important aspect validate diagnostic image information . Philips develop new algorithm capable process image similar image quality acquire low dose .</detailed_description>
