	<brief_summary>The ability spermatozoon produce reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) respect since 1940 's . Oxidative stress limit functional competence mammalian spermatozoon via lipid peroxidation , induction oxidative DNA damage formation protein adduct . Nitric oxide ( NO ) free radical generate oxidation L-arginine L-citrulline reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) -dependent NO synthases . Several study suggest overproduction free radical subsequent excessive exposure oxidative condition potential pathogenetic implication , due reduction sperm motility . The present study conduct study effect Zn supplementation level NO synthase arginase semen patient asthenozoospmia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study suggest high concentration NO play injurious consequence spermatozoon kinetic characteristic . These study report NO may react superoxide hydrogen peroxide , result production peroxinitrite , hydroxyl radical , singlet oxygen , cause oxidation sperm membrane lipid thiol protein . NO also may inhibit cellular respiration nitro-sylation heme mitochondrial enzyme , aconitase , glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase , lead reduction adenosine triphosphate due loss motility spermatozoon .</detailed_description>
