	<brief_summary>End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) severe clinical state irreversible loss endogenous kidney function , shorten life expectancy , leave untreated . In state ESRD , 5000 uremic toxin accumulate body cause dysfunction various organ system . The survival patient depend renal replacement therapy , hemodialysis ( HD ) , artificially purify blood toxin . The investigator assume uremic toxin also present patient 's exhaled breath , could detect non-invasive highly sensitive test : NA-NOSE artificial olfactory system . It base analysis volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) , novel , non-invasive field medical diagnostics . The NA-NOSE make array nanosensors , develop collaborator Dr. Hossam Haick ( Chemical Engineering , Technion ) . In current study , investigator utilize technology identify VOCs exhale breath dialysis patient , characterize certain pattern expression could potentially help future monitoring HD adequacy . The investigator plan collect 150 breath sample patient dialysis , healthy subject . All participant provide sign informed consent . Subsequently , analysis sample do Dr. Haick 's laboratory , use Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry parameter extract sensor response .</brief_summary>
