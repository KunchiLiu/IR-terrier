	<brief_summary>- Due increase risk brain damage , continuous monitor cerebral oxygenation interest . We evaluate capability INVOS Oximeter detect induce change cerebral regional saturation . - The purpose study investigate hypothesis particular CPAP flow pressure optimize regional cerebral oxygenation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neonatal Cerebral Oxygenation Changes CPAP Flow Pressure - Evaluation With INVOS Oximeter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infant increase risk brain damage compare term infant , cerebral hypoxia consider important role . The preterm infant increase risk respiratory distress , episode low oxygenation , mechanical ventilation , risk hypocapnia labile low blood pressure . These condition affect microcirculation hence oxygenation brain . Hyperoxia also point interest , since high level oxygen cause vasoconstriction . Preterm infant often treat CPAP ( Continuous positive airway pressure ) , effect different flow pressure regional cerebral oxygenation know . The investigator examine normal physiological response brain group preterm infant gestational age ( GA ) 32-37 week group term infant commonly use treatment neonatology , CPAP ( Continuous positive airway pressure ) . The investigator dynamic research continuously monitor cerebral oxygenation use INVOS® Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter ( Near InfraRed Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) ) . INVOS® first NIRS-based oximeter CE-approved hospital use Denmark . There follow-up .</detailed_description>
