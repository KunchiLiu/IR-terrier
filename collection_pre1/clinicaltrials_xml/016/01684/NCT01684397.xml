	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose pazopanib hydrochloride bevacizumab see well work treat patient previously untreated kidney cancer spread place body ( metastatic ) . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , prevent tumor growth block ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safe phase II dose novel regimen . ( Phase I ) II . To determine median progression free survival ( PFS ) novel regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity propose regimen . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate response rate . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) . ( Phase I ) IV . To evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) level various time point correlate response . ( Phase I ) V. To evaluate safety toxicity new regimen . ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate VEGF level , interleukin ( IL ) -8 level MDSC level various time point correlate outcome . ( Phase II ) VII . To evaluate PFS rate 12 month . ( Phase II ) VIII . To evaluate overall survival . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 1-28 , bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 36 50 . Courses repeat every 70 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
