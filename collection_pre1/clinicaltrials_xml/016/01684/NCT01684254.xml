	<brief_summary>The present project focus evaluate technical efficacy in-shoe gait monitoring device ( ActiveGait ) laboratory base biomechanical gait assessment child exhibit gait deviation due CP idiopathic toe walk wear device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An In-Shoe Device Monitor Toe-Walking Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator protocol intend develop device rely propose Toe Walk Severity ( TWS ) index , novel outcome measure quantify change severity toe walk time assess outcome surgical non-surgical intervention . Tasks include : A.Validate data acquisition measurement laboratory set compare gold-standard video analysis field ( outside laboratory ) . B.Develop multi-stage classification algorithm subset laboratory field data . C.Validate classification algorithm random subset laboratory field data . D.Explore development Toe Walking Severity ( TWS ) index available biomechanical ActiveGait data different ambulatory condition . E.Perform longitudinal study childhood toe walk population include laboratory analysis at-home monitoring use ActiveGait technology . F.Analyze statistically sensitivity specificity TWS index compare clinical observation . Gather evidence TWS index provide mean track change severity toe walk time .</detailed_description>
