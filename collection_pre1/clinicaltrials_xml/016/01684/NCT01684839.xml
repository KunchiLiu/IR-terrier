	<brief_summary>Neuroma excision digital nerve reconstruction remain best option treatment Painful Digital Neuroma ( PDN ) . When distal nerve end preserve , conventional nonvascularized nerve graft primary option bridge defect . The investigator hypothesize pedicled nerve flap take dorsal branch homolateral digital nerve well conventional method reconstruction digital nerve defect painful neuroma resection . This study report treatment painful digital neuroma use pedicled nerve flap take dorsal branch homolateral digital nerve . From May 2007 March 2010 , patient previous nerve injury without nerve repair . The mechanisms injury include sharp cut , avulsion crush . The defect middle distal phalanx palmar digital crease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our selection criterion study include patient PDN scar wound bed poor coverage , PDN locate middle distal phalanx palmar digital crease , defect digital nerve neuroma resection equal le 3 cm length . The exclusion criterion include PDN healthy soft tissue , digital nerve defect longer 3 cm , injury course pedicle donor nerve , thumb neuroma . A finger small distal end digital nerve also exclude , neurorrhaphy extremely difficult situation .</detailed_description>
