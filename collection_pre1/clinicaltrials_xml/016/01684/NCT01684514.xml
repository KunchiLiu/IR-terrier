	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Findings Patients With Proctosigmoiditis Before After Initiation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Confocal laser endomicroscopy finding patient proctosigmoiditis initiation treatment Background Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Crohn 's disease often strike terminal ileum , may occur mouth anus . It characterize segmental spread transmural inflammation occasional presence granuloma tissue sample . Ulcerative colitis find colon involve practice always rectum . The inflammation limit mucosa submucosa , diffusion continuous . The development endoscopy make procedure central part diagnostic therapeutic management patient gastrointestinal disease , include IBD . The entire gastrointestinal tract available inspection therapy . A limitation study histology , often essential diagnosis treatment patient , always precisely evaluated conventional examination . The proper handling detect lesion require addition endoscopic evaluation , histological evaluation tissue involve , make tissue sample necessary order obtain definitive diagnosis thus optimal handling . Therefore , endoscopic procedure tissue sample intestinal mucosa must take , rarely involve great risk patient , cause delay , due preparation time histological analysis case even due re-examination histopathology negative . In treatment IBD endoscopic assessment severity extension absolutely essential choice treatment . The `` Gold standard '' optimal treatment call `` deep '' remission , define clinical endoscopic remission assess conventional endoscopy . Within recent year new approach introduce , wherein microscopic structure intestinal mucous evaluate continuously vivo endoscopic procedure . The technique call confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) . CLE function mean laser device , insert build endoscope , use illuminator line small area precise depth . The tissue first add fluorescence intravenous administration . The reflection mucosa capture focused area magnify two-dimensional image mucosal microscopic structure form . This provide u `` optical biopsy '' , compare similar microscopic image . This provide u potential opportunity immediate diagnose target therapy procedure . The optical biopsy store digitally way also evaluate postprocedure . During CLE multiple frame generate per second , store continuously , thereby form movie sequence , microscopic assessment tissue become dynamic i.e . flow small vessel may observe . A current hypothesis pathogenesis IBD defective barrier function may key element . The intestinal barrier compose epithelial cell , bound together so-called `` tight junction '' . Experimental study show increased intestinal permeability IBD patient degree permeability prognostic indicator relapse Crohn 's disease . In CLE-studies , defective barrier function identify vivo efflux fluorescein intestinal wall demonstrate significantly great IBD patient compare healthy control group . The space epithelial cell also increase . In patient remission defective barrier function predispose relapse disease . However , possible realize dysfunction conventional histological examination , well parameter , require dynamic microscopic evaluation . By implement CLE sensitivity endoscopic assessment may increase , may change characteristic `` deep '' remission , also assessment disease activity . CLE present rapidly grow field development primarily use connection endoscopy digestive tract , also use connection endoscopy urinary respiratory tract . CLE show , reduce number tissue sample significantly without compromise diagnosis . Furthermore , several study suggest CLE contribute accurate diagnosis , preliminary study suggest degree disease estimate good compare conventional endoscopy . Yet , data evaluate applicability method relation monitor treatment response real prognostic tool . CLE new method , therefore still many unresolved issue area clarify exist technology finally implement daily practice . There research group lead professor endoscopy Peter Vilmann several year foster great experience introduction new method . This include implementation relevant study collection publication scientific data international level , modality find proper place diagnosis treatment patient . Introduction : By conventional colonoscopy , degree spread inflammation often underestimated overlook patient acute inflammation due insufficient sensitivity . In ulcerative colitis course disease particular risk treatment failure relate degree acute inflammation , addition clinical endoscopic observation assess change crypt architecture , infiltration acute inflammatory cell lamina propria . The dissemination disease also particularly important choice treatment , change successively suppositories enemas systemic corticosteroid depend proximal boundary inflammation . Taking tissue sample may partially prevent underestimation , time consuming , expensive rarely lead radically change treatment strategy , since endoscopy reference context . The literature suggest two classification inflammation base CLE , partly - start , use estimate disease activity initiation treatment control group . In addition , personal observation record analyze . This assessment subsequently use intra-and inter-observer study stratification CLE-observations relation acute inflammation degree tissue sample . Hypothesis : CLE use assess degree extend acute chronic inflammation treatment response patient ulcerative colitis sensitive supplementary conventional diagnostics . Design : A blinded prospective observation methodology study patient initiation topical steroid treatment subsequent calculation intra-and inter-observer variability . Method : Enrolled patient examine conventional colonoscopy CLE initiation topical treatment , respectively . The degree distribution acute inflammation assess conventional microscopy ( Mayo score ) , CLE ( crypt architecture , micro vascular change presence inflammatory cell lamina propria defective barrier function ) histology biopsy . It expect previously describe CLE-finding found , record evaluate described . The terminal ileum colonic segment ( caecum , ascend colon , transversal colon , descend colon , colon sigmoid rectum ) assess describe . CLE finding grade analysis accord follow scale : Crypt Architecture : 1 : Normal , 2 : Changed shape , size distribution , 3 : Crypt destruction abscess Micro vascular change : 1 : Normal , 2 : Slightly high number moderately dilate , 3 : Significantly high number massively dilated Infiltration inflammatory cell : 1 : No , 2 : Presence &lt; 50 % crypt , 3 : Presence &gt; 50 % crypt Defective barrier function : 1 : Normal , 2 : Functional defect , 3 : Structural defect The correlation histology ( `` gold standard '' ) , Mayo score , combine clinical endoscopic index , CLE calculate . This apply IBD patient control group . An intra-and inter-observer study plan initial study , CLE operator blind respect . The pathologist blind conventional CLE observation . CLE result stratify order identify record CLE parameter correlate best two method , therefore suitable study focus inflammation . In addition , determination relationship CLE finding treatment effect individual patient conduct . Statistical method : Comparison CLE-findings relation Mayo score histology make use Spearman correlation analysis . To evaluate treatment effect Wilcoxon Signed Rank test use . In inter-and intra-observer study weight kappa statistic use . Patient : A complete sample-size calculation make inter-and intra-observer study individual CLE parameter 3 observer . If possible , achieve kappa value 0.9 confidence interval 0.05 , must 122 observation . If register Mayo score , CLE parameter take tissue sample pathology abovementioned intestinal segment two endoscopy , 14 observation patient register subsequently assess relation parameter use study . If waiver , ileocolonoscopies fulfil CLE observation analyze , 9 patient need include . It assume , however , 25 % expect observation obtain , since CLE observation unsatisfactory , examination interrupt , patient evaluate . Thus , 36 patient must enrol study achieve desire strength , 10 control group .</detailed_description>
