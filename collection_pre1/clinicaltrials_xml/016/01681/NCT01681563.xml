	<brief_summary>This phase II multicenter , non-comparative , open label study old previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia patient , require therapy , aim define efficacy profile ( ORR , CRR TTP ) pentostatin cyclophosphamide give combination Ofatumumab ( PCO ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Pentostatin Plus Cyclophosphamide With Ofatumumab ( PCO ) Older Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common chronic lymphoid leukemia , comprise 30 % adult leukemia . The majority CLL patient advance age . Currently , immunochemotherapy Rituximab , Fludarabine Cyclophosphamide ( RFC ) standard care previously untreated patient CLL require treatment . The combination Pentostatin Cyclophosphamide generate excellent clinical response rate pretreated B-CLL patient . Early data use Ofatumumab single agent Fludarabine-refractory CLL patient report . Given report efficacy chemo-immunotherapy combination CLL promising activity toxicity profile Pentostatin combination , design trial Pentostatin , Cyclophosphamide , Ofatumumab previously untreated old patient CLL . The aim improve efficacy , Rituximab resistant CLL , toxicity consider good profile tolerability show use Ofatumumab single agent .</detailed_description>
