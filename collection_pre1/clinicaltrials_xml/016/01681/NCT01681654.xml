	<brief_summary>Research physical activity nutrition intervention aim positively impact symptom management , treatment-related recovery quality life largely exclude head neck cancer population . This translate lack clinical programming available patient population . Head neck cancer patient deal severe weight loss , upwards 70 % attributed lean muscle wasting , lead extend recovery time , decrease quality life ( QoL ) , impaired physical functioning . To date , intervention address body composition issue focus solely diet , despite finding nutritional therapy alone insufficient mitigate change . A combined physical activity nutrition intervention , also incorporate important educational component know positively impact behaviour change , warranted population . Pilot work suggest large patient demand clinic support health care professional comprehensive program . Therefore , purpose present study examine impact time 12-week PA nutrition intervention ( either follow treatment ) HN cancer patient body composition , recovery , serum inflammatory marker quality life . In addition , investigator examine impact 12-week maintenance program , deliver immediately follow intervention , adherence , patient-reported outcome ( i.e. , management physical psychosocial treatment-related symptom side-effects ) , well return work . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) patient randomize intervention treatment start experience improve symptom management decrease lean body composition change , directly improve recovery QoL ; ( 2 ) patient receive maintenance support program well long-term adherence therefore superior treatment-related symptom management , physical psychosocial functioning ; ( 3 ) return work index improve healthcare utilization cost low participant receive immediate intervention ( vs. delay ) well receive maintenance program ( vs. maintenance ) . This research facilitate advancement patient wellness , survivorship , autonomy , carve path physical activity wellness education model implement cancer center .</brief_summary>
