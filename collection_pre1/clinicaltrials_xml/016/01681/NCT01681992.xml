	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Safety Study GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' Combined Measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) Vaccine Children Their Second Year Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial Phase IIIA , randomize , observer-blind , control , multi-center , multi-country study four parallel group . This study evaluate immunogenicity safety GSK Biologicals ' trivalent investigational MMR vaccine ( referred Inv_MMR vaccine , throughout document ) contrast US standard care comparator vaccine ( M M R®II , Merck Co. , Inc. , refer Com_MMR throughout document ) child second year life . The first dose two-dose study design establish end shelf-life potency Inv_MMR vaccine . The Inv_MMR vaccine give one two lot ; one minimum potency , designate Inv_MMR_Min ; mid-range medium potency designate Inv_MMR_Med two group . The second dose Inv_MMR group potency within release range market vaccine . The Com_MMR vaccine consist two lot designate Com_MMR_L1 Com_MMR_L2 analyze pooled lot within study . The first MMR vaccine dose co-administered Varivax , Havrix ( US sub-cohort ) Prevnar 13 routinely administer child age US .</detailed_description>
