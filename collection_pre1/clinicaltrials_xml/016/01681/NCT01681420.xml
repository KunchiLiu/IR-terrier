	<detailed_description>Although donate blood screen HIV antibody , residual risk contamination persists due immunological window period antibody detectable . Deferral donor behavioral risk HIV one mean reduce window period contamination ; recruitment voluntary donor community ( versus family replacement donor ) hold another . Contrary expectation , shift community donor result decrease HIV prevalence unit blood collect investigator transfusion service . The investigator preliminary research indicate person elevate risk use donation mean test HIV . These test-seeking donor high trust blood bank , know place receive test , low understand immunological window period believe acceptable deny risk order test donation . The test-seeking phenomenon may therefore threaten safety blood supply . Test seek blood bank also ill serf person need risk reduction counsel disclose true behavior donation process still test . Donors also low rate return test result therefore receive confirmation referral care . To assess whether HCT time donation improve blood safety address prevention care need , investigator randomize donor candidate offer service on-site . As biological marker elevate risk HIV , investigator compare prevalence HSV-2 among donor choose test choose donate offer choice ( Aim 1 ) . The impact intervention measure increase person receive test result , disclosure counseling referral ( Aim 2 ) . Secondary outcome include difference prevalence transfusion-transmitted infection ( HIV , HCV , HBV , syphilis , HTLV I/II , Chagas disease ) , donor motivation ( e.g. , test-seeking vs. altruism ) , donor deferral rate , use confidential unit exclusion , satisfaction procedure blood bank volume blood available use . RCT result provide rigorous evidence provision on-site HCT effective mean improve blood safety link individual need health service .</detailed_description>
