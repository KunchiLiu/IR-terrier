	<brief_summary>High intake insoluble fiber strongly associate reduced incidence diabetes cardiovascular event prospective observation study . Our primary objective compare life style diabetes prevention program ( PRAEDIAS ) without add insoluble fiber effectiveness prevent incident diabetes type 2 high risk individual impair glucose tolerance . Subjects IGT willing participate intervention use independent control . Secondary aim identify mechanisms action regard body composition , anti-inflammatory metabolic effect fiber . We propose randomize , prospective intervention study . The result general relevance guidance fiber intake population help food industry design healthy high fiber food . Fiber add low cost numerous food . Increased fiber intake may therefore provide simple non-cognitive prevention strategy effective population level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective investigate whether insoluble fiber add standard nutrition reduce progression impairment glucose metabolism high risk population impair glucose metabolism . Large prospective cohort study clearly show mainly insoluble cereal fiber whole grain associate reduced risk type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . However , lack evidence prospective intervention study target evaluate potential dietary fiber reduce diabetes cardiovascular disease recently state Cochrane Foundation . Dietary fiber intake generally much low currently recommend , may part relate side effect whole grain nutrient gustatory property . Intestinally uncomfortable effect least partly relate fermentation much less induced insoluble non-fermentable fiber soluble fermentable fiber . The prospective demonstration beneficial effect insoluble fiber prevent diabetes type 2 allow detail nutritional recommendation . This may serve support consumption metabolically beneficial constituent fiber-rich diet help increase fiber intake high fiber natural nutrient everyday nutrient enrich insoluble natural fiber .</detailed_description>
