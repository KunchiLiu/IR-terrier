	<brief_title>Effect Modified Citrus Pectin PSA Kinetics Biochemical Relapsed PC With Serial Increases PSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study effect PectaSol-C Modified Citrus Pectin ( MCP ) subject select basis documented PC post local therapy , biochemical relapse , linear progression least 3 PSA test least 3 month . After initial screening , treatment { 4.8 gram ( 6 capsule ) three time day away meal } continue 6 month provide patient show benefit tolerating therapy well . Patient tolerability MCP assess compare result monthly self-assessment diary baseline assessment . Prostate cancer common cancer among men , except non melanoma skin cancer . It second lead cause cancer relate death men . About 33 % prostate cancer patient treat primary therapy ( surgery radiation ) recur form non metastatic biochemically relapsed prostate cancer ( BRPC-M0 ) . In patient , PSA rise scan negative metastasis . Recent survey demonstrate approximately 40 % prostate cancer patient use various complementary alternative medicine modality component therapy . Currently , standard treatment biochemical failure prove benefit . Patients encourage enroll clinical trial help establish standard care . Studies show 80 % patient BRPC-M0 , PSA rise least 25 % every 6 month . Native pectin complex carbohydrate soluble fiber . Dietary fiber , pectin , show positive effect wide spectrum pathological condition . Their positive influence human health explain antioxidative , hypocholesterolemic , anticancer effect . MCP compose short , slightly-branched , carbohydrate chain derive soluble albedo fraction citrus fruit peel , alter decrease molecular weight degree esterification use pH , temperature , control enzymatic process . This specific modification critical allow absorption MCP circulatory system ensure target bioactivity throughout body . MCP relatively rich galactose thus antagonizes bind protein galectin-3 result suppression cancer cell aggregation , adhesion , metastasis . MCP act ligand galectin-3 , play major role tumor formation progression . It show use combination fluorescence microscopy , flow cytometry , atomic force microscopy , pectin galactan specifically bind recombinant form human galectin-3 . MCP show anti-metastatic effect cancer cell multiple vitro vivo study . MCP inhibit carbohydrate mediate tumor growth , angiogenesis metastasis via effect galectin-3 function demonstrate animal study MCP 's inhibition breast colon cancer progression . Results demonstrate 70.2 % reduction breast tumor growth , 66 % reduction breast angiogenesis , 0 % breast lung metastasis compare 100 % control group ; 0 % colon liver metastasis compare 60 % control group ; 25 % colon lymph metastasis compare 100 % control group . In early study oral intake MCP show act potent inhibitor spontaneous prostate carcinoma metastasis animal model , demonstrate significant 56 % reduction lung metastasis . Human cancer cell line ( LNCaP androgen dependent &amp; PC3 androgen independent ) mouse prostate cancer cell line ( CASP2-1 androgen dependent CASP1-1 androgen independent ) treat 1 % MCP show follow cytotoxicity due induce apoptosis : 52.28 % LNCaP ; 48.16 % PC3 ; 23.03 % CASP2-1 ; 49.01 % CASP1-1.13 The effect MCP cell-cell cell-matrix interaction mediate carbohydrate-recognition investigated look MCP-inhibited B16-F1 melanoma cell adhesion aggregation . MCP show inhibit anchorage-independent growth B16-F1 cell . These result indicate carbohydrate-recognition cell surface galectin-3 involved cell-extracellular matrix interaction play role anchorage-independent growth well vivo embolization tumor cell . The modulation lung colonization B16-F1 melanoma cell MCP first observe 1992 injection MCP significantly decrease B16-F1 experimental metastasis ( great 90 % ) . Galectin-3 participation adhesion MDA-MB-435 cell endothelium observe cluster galectin-3 endothelial cell sit contact tumor cell , suggest potential functional significance anti-adhesive therapy cancer metastasis . The anti-metastatic effect MCP also show reduce liver metastasis dose-dependent manner . The use MCP combination chemotherapy drug doxorubicin demonstrate increased cytotoxicity effect induce rapid cell death prostate cancer cell line DU-145 ( androgen independent ) apoptosis , LNCaP ( androgen dependant ) cell cycle arrest ( G2-M arrest ) . These result show promise use MCP doxorubicin adjuvant chemotherapy may allow low dosage cancer drug use less toxicity . A human clinical pilot trial MCP show increase prostate specific antigen doubling time , marker slow progression prostate cancer . Clinical research MCP also demonstrate significant improvement quality life stabilization disease patient advance solid tumor . In addition therapeutic role cancer , MCP show remove toxic metal body without affect essential mineral . In clinical study , baseline level heavy metal essential mineral establish 24-hours urine collection prior oral administration MCP . 24-hours urine collection repeat day 1 6 . Urinary excretion lead , mercury , cadmium , arsenic increase significantly , essential mineral change significantly side effect report . In hospital study China , child lead toxicity give MCP . Their blood serum level go correspond lead level urine increase significantly , without side effect . MCP immunostimulatory property demonstrate human blood sample , include activation functional NK cell K562 leukemic cell culture : Unsaturated oligogalacturonic acid appear immunostimulatory carbohydrate MCP . Human blood sample collect healthy volunteer incubate increase concentration MCP antibody . After 24-hours , blood-antibody mix lysed run flow cytometer use 3-color protocol % activate T-cytotoxic cell subset , B-cell , NK-cells , % increase untreated control calculate significant dose dependent activation see . The ability activate NK cell induce leukemia cell death analyze co-incubating MCP-treated lymphocyte K562 T-cell leukemia cell induce leukemia cell death determine great 50 % . MCP demonstrate protective experimental nephropathy modulation early proliferation later galectin-3 expression , apoptosis fibrosis experimentally modulate galectin-3 folic acid ( FA ) -induced acute kidney injury . Mice pre-treated normal 1 % MCP-supplemented drinking water one week FA injection . During initial injury phase , FA treat mouse lose weight whilst kidney enlarge secondary renal insult ; gross change significantly lessen MCP group associate significant change galectin-3 expression . At histological level , MCP clearly reduce renal cell proliferation affect apoptosis . Later , recovery phase two week , MCP-treated mouse demonstrate reduce galectin-3 association decrease renal fibrosis , macrophage , proinflammatory cytokine expression apoptosis . Galectin-3 inhibition MCP demonstrate block Aldosterone ( Aldo ) induce collagen type I synthesis . Rats treat Aldo-salt combine MCP 3 week . Hypertensive Aldo-treated rat present vascular hypertrophy , inflammation , fibrosis , increase aortic Gal-3 expression . MCP treatment reverse effect . MCP affirm GRAS ( generally regard safe ) US Code Federal Regulation 21CFR184.1588 .</detailed_description>
