	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational combination drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve combination drug AML . As part research study , take lenalidomide combination MEC . MEC FDA approve chemotherapy drug commonly use treatment AML . Lenalidomide approve FDA patient multiple myeloma , patient myelodysplasia . Lenalidomide consider investigational research study approve FDA patient AML . Lenalidomide drug affect immune system , call immunomodulatory drug IMID . This drug successful treatment patient multiple myeloma patient myelodysplasia , pre-leukemic condition . Other research study suggest lenalidomide may also effective patient AML . Since know many patient receive MEC chemotherapy alone prolonged remission ( time free leukemia ) , study addition lenalidomide MEC . In research study , look high dose lenalidomide give safely MEC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After undergo screening procedure confirm eligible participate research study admit hospital . You likely receive majority treatment inpatient basis . You remain hospital least Days 4-8 discharge discretion study doctor . It likely hospitalize several week due risk infection chemotherapy . Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant relapse refractory AML , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . If take part study give study drug-dosing calendar . There one cycle treatment , 28 day long . On Days 1 14 receive lenalidomide orally . On Days 4-8 receive MEC chemotherapy : mitoxantrone IV ( intravenously , vein ) 30 minute , etoposide IV one hour , cytarabine IV one hour . While study undergo daily clinical exam first 14 day least twice week blood count recover treatment . A clinical exam consist physical exam , question general health specific question problem might medication may take . You also undergo blood test assess disease status determine organ function level . This happen daily first 14 day least week ( 3 time per week ) blood count recover treatment . Additionally bone marrow aspirate/biopsy complete time blood cell count recovery ( usually day 20 45 ) clinically indicate . We would like keep track medical condition two year final dose study drug . We would like get touch every 6 month see . Keeping touch check condition help u look long-term effect fo research study .</detailed_description>
