	<brief_summary>The use dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor glucagon like peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) analogues treatment diabetic mellitus ( DM ) type 2 grow ( 1,2 ) . Currently , agent approve combination insulin . The potential combine use insulin garner increase attention due reduce side effect associate insulin therapy improve glycemic control . Some investigator report GLP-1 analogue combine insulin reduces HbA1c weight low risk hypoglycemia high treatment satisfaction ( 3 ) . However , duration treatment short time le mean 3.0 year alteration chronic diabetic complication combination incretin-based insulin therapy know . We evaluate long effect add incretin-based therapy ( DPP-4 inhibitor GLP-1 analogue ) insulin therapy glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) glycemic control , body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , insulin dosage , frequency hypoglycemia , chronic diabetic complication 5 years-treatments .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cohort Study Incretin-based Therapy Combined With Insulin Type 2 Diabetic Patients 5 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat diet , exercise , and/or oral conventional pharmacotherapy combine insulin . Oral conventional pharmacotherapy consist α-glycosidase inhibitor ( α-GI ) , sulfonylurea ( SU ) , biguanide ( BG ) , thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) , combination agent . Insulin therapy consist subcutaneous injection long-acting insulin analogue prior sleep bolus subcutaneous injection rapid-acting insulin analogue multiple daily injection , subcutaneous injection mixed insulin analogue twice day . In spite treatment , physician charge judge value HbA1c inappropriate , physician add pharmacotherapy combine insulin incretin-based therapy . 2.3.2 . For ethical reason , patient treat various anti-hypertensive , anti-diabetic , anti-dyslipidemia and/or anti-hypercoagulation agent course study patient ' doctor part continue standard medical care . As drug use treatment disorder complication since time study , content change study principle unless complication cure . If new complication occur study period , appropriate treatment give judgment investigator .</detailed_description>
