	<brief_title>Oral Nitrite Nitrate Healthy Normal Volunteer Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical clinical research last decade reveal important vasoprotective effect nitrate nitrite regard reduction blood pressure , vascular inflammation endothelial dysfunction . New finding suggest effect nitrate nitrite therapy regulation glucose-insulin homeostasis . Development oral formulation nitrate nitrite salt attractive , whereby nitrite would ensure rapid act effect upon absorption , nitrate would continuously provide slow formation nitrite prolonged period time via enterosalivary circulation pathway . For reason , development oral formulation nitrate nitrite salt attractive , whereby nitrite would ensure rapid act effect upon absorption , nitrate would continuously provide slow formation nitrite prolonged period time via enterosalivary circulation pathway . This study aim establish pharmacokinetics , metabolism interconversion nitrate nitrite nitrite nitric oxide vivo healthy adult normal volunteer .</detailed_description>
