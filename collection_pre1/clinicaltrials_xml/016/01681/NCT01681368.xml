	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Ovarian cancer ninth common cancer woman ( exclude skin cancer ) . It rank fifth cause cancer death woman . In United States , 21,550 new case 14,600 death estimate annually . - Approximately 90 % primary malignant ovarian tumor epithelial ( carcinoma ) . - Although 70 % woman advance disease respond optimal debulking surgery follow platinum-taxane base chemotherapy , duration response short relapse common . Subsequent response salvage therapy regimen tend brief ( less six month ) due tumor progressive resistance chemotherapy ( 1 ) . - A family proteins , know Inhibitors Apoptotic Proteins ( IAPs ) , play critical role block apoptotic signal multiple point . IAPs regulate number pathway include classical alternative nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF- ( K ) B ) function , activation apoptosis either extrinsic intrinsic pathway . Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 1 ( cIAP1 ) act critical switch promote pro-survival nuclear factor kappa-B ( NF-B ) pathway prevent caspase activation . - In normal cell stimulate undergo apoptosis either extrinsic intrinsic pathway , second mitochondrial-derived activation caspares ( SMAC ) release mitochondrion , antagonize IAP , remove blockade activated caspase function , thereby enable apoptotic cell death . In tumor cell , however , apoptosis dysregulated due insufficient amount SMAC upstream blockade apoptotic activation . - Classical activation NF- ( K ) B dependent presence cIAP1 cIAP2 proteins part TNF receptor-associated factor 2 ( TRAF2 ) complex . SMAC inhibit cIAP1 cIAP2 , lead inactivation tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) mediate NF- B activation . SMAC inhibition cIAP1 cIAP2 lead pathway up-regulation . Birinapant ( TL32711 ) synthetic peptidomimetic antagonist IAPs ( SMAC-mimetic ) , mimic endogenous SMAC result rapid irreversible initiation apoptotic cell death . SMAC-mimetics represent novel target therapeutic approach cancer therapy . The addition SMAC mimetic , inhibit NF- B activity , down-regulate cell survival pathway , overcome blockade apoptotic pathway lead increase tumor cell death . - Our laboratory demonstrate serous ovarian cancer cell-autonomous activation NF-B signal show correlate poor prognosis . - Therefore , hypothesize SMAC-mimetic activity birinapant may selectively toxic ovarian cancer display high canonical NF- ( K ) B activity . - To summarize , relapse platinum refractory resistant ovarian cancer disease limit therapeutic option poor prognosis . Birinapant offer opportunity develop effective well tolerate therapeutic significant unmet need . OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective determine efficacy define Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) criteria2 either objective response progession-free survival last great 6 month , patient relapse platinum refractory resistant ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer treat birinapant . - The seconday objective include overall survival , safety tolerability single agent birinapant population . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : - Females great equal 18 year age histologically proven advanced metastatic unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer relapse refractory prior platinum-based standard care systemic regimen . - Life expectancy great 3 month . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . - Adequate organ functionas define liver , kidney , hematologic laboratory test . Design : - This open label , non-randomized phase II trial determine efficacy administration SMAC-mimetic birinapant patient relapse platinum refractory resistant ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . - Birinapant give single agent disease progression weekly three week 4 week interval . - The primary endpoint efficacy define accord GOG guideline overall response rate progression-free survival last least 6 month . Overall survival , toxicity modulation signal event tumor secondary measure . - Patients evaluated baseline prior cycle history physical examination every two cycle examination image study ( compute tomography ( CT ) scan ) . Laboratory study perform weekly prior dose except week 4 ( rest week ) . - Tumor biopsy perform prior birinapant initiation optional tumor biopsy perform 2 48 hour cycle 2 day 15 infusion . - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell also harvest time point biopsy . - Reassessment imaging ( compute tomography ( CT ) scan ) document response perform end 2 cycle every 2 cycle thereafter .</detailed_description>

Because dose adverse event data currently available use birinapant patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Able understand voluntarily sign write informed consent , willing able comply protocol requirement include requirement biopsy research purpose . Advanced metastatic unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer relapse resistant refractory prior platinumbased standard care systemic regimen . Patients unable receive platinum , due either allergic reaction medical reason , eligible protocol . There limitation amount prior therapy allow . Patients must least 4 week previous therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy monoclonal antibody , alternative therapy investigational therapeutic agent ) . Patients cranial radiation therapy need complete great equal 8 week prior commence study . Patients permit receive investigational imaging agent study . Patients major surgery must fully recover require recovery period great equal 4 week prior enrol study . Histopathologic diagnosis must confirm Laboratory Pathology ( LP ) , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . A block primary tumor , access recut slide prefer .
