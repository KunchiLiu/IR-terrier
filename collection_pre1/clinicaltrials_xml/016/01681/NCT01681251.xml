	<detailed_description>The management delivery intravenous fluid surgical operation one important duty anesthesiologist . There grow body evidence fluid overload surgical patient associate decreased wound healing , slow return gut function , anastomotic breakdown , pulmonary edema post-operative visual change . In United States , abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnose 190,000 people per year , 50,000 aneurysm repaired5 . Recent advance endovascular technique allow many patient forego open repair . However , technical difficulty , many patient still require open repair . The common cause morbidity patient related post-operative gastrointestinal tract dysfunction . This usually involve adynamic ileus patient develop fourth post-operative day . This delay tolerance enteral food lengthen hospital stay hospital cost . It also potential cause morbidity patient may require total parenteral nutrition await return bowel function . There several cause gastrointestinal morbidity include direct mechanical trauma bowel surgery activation inflammatory cascade . These factor unfortunately modifiable team care patient . One factor modifiable amount type intravenous fluid administer patient . Typically , anesthesiologist decide amount fluid administer patient base parameter heart rate , blood pressure urine output . These unfortunately unreliable determine patient 's volume status , parameter within normal range , patient might still inadequate perfusion vital organ . Further , clinician 's reliance blood pressure target fluid administration ignores fact organ require blood flow well pressure function optimally . Until recently , way measure blood flow insertion pulmonary artery catheter . Based several study show lack benefit invasive procedure , fall favor non-cardiac arena . Newer monitor cardiac output attach patient arterial catheter ( commonly place major surgical procedure ) offer alternative method clinician measure cardiac output . One monitor , FloTrac system ( Edwards Life Sciences , Irvine CA ) , utilizes arterial pulse contour calculate cardiac output ( CO ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) monitor volume status . In patient mechanically ventilated phasic variation CO stroke volume base ventilatory cycle . Large change stroke volume ventilatory cycle may indicate hypovolemia patient . The administration intravenous fluid patient result decrease SVV . Thus , SVV use volume monitor use titrate intravenous therapy . There several trial ( mostly colonic resection surgery ) look goal direct therapy similar device find decrease patient morbidity length stay . All study common use minimally invasive CO monitor reliance colloid predominant fluid utilized case . The utilization SVV determine volume status novel approach fluid management surgical patient . As state , clinician ' historical reliance pressure ( blood pressure central venous pressure ) estimate intravascular volume status base incomplete understanding factor govern organ blood flow . To end , investigator also assess several parameter study attempt ascertain best predict fluid responsiveness . Fluid responsiveness define ability predict give patient increase CO fluid bolus . To date look systematic fashion . There also evidence suggest goal direct therapy reduces degree inflammation invariably occur operation magnitude . It hypothesize resuscitate endothelium effectively intravenous fluid remain intravascular space longer , less endothelial damage thus less inflammation .</detailed_description>
