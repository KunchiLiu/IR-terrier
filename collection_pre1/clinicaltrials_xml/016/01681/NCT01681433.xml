	<brief_title>OGX-427 Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer With Prostate-Specific Antigen Progression While Receiving Abiraterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . This open-label , randomize , Phase II clinical trial design evaluate anti-tumor effect OGX-427 continue abiraterone acetate prednisone versus continue abiraterone acetate prednisone alone men MCRPC evidence PSA progression evidence symptomatic radiographic progression would require alternative therapy ( e.g. , need radiation therapy pain significant progression visceral metastasis ) . Patients control arm allow cross-over receive OGX-427 follow documented disease progression . Patients randomize equal probability one follow arm : EXPERIMENTAL ARM ( Arm A ) : OGX-427 Starting within 7 day randomization , three load dos 600 mg intravenously ( IV ) within Week 1 possible ( 10 day initiate treatment ) , follow weekly dos 800 mg IV Continuation standard therapy abiraterone acetate 1000 mg mouth ( PO ) daily prednisone 10-20 mg PO daily CONTROL ARM ( Arm B ) : Continuation standard therapy abiraterone acetate 1000 mg PO daily prednisone 10-20 mg PO daily After document disease progression , patient Arm B may opt receive OGX-427 treatment ( accord Arm A schedule ) follow screen evaluation ( i.e. , inclusion exclusion criterion meet ) Both Arms : Evaluations 4 week-intervals . Disease assessment require milestone Day 60 assessment ( expect occur 8 week treatment prior Day 1 , Week 9 ) 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 week ( applicable ) document disease progression . Patients withdraw study reason document disease progression patient withdrawal consent follow every 4 week Off-Treatment Follow-up Period document disease progression . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Life Expectancy : Not Specified Hematopoietic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109 cell /L , platelet count ≥ 100 x 109 /L , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion Hepatic : - Total bilirubin ≤ 1.1 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease , case direct bilirubin ≤ ULN require - Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) alanine transaminase ( SGOT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 3.0 x ULN Renal : - Creatinine ≤ 1.3 x ULN Cardiac : - Known leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Classification Class III IV heart failure Other : - Castrate serum testosterone level ( &lt; 50 ng/dL &lt; 1.7 nmol/L ) - Potassium within normal limit</detailed_description>
