	<brief_title>Fluorescence Angiography : Planning Monitoring Perforator Flaps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reconstructive surgery intend replace amputated anatomical region autologous tissue take distant location : flap . The goal restitute ad integrum minimal sequela . Among flaps available , perforator flap advantage highly plastic , large take accessory vessel loss wich compromise vitality sample site . However variable anatomy require irradiate preoperative morphological assessment ( CT angiography ) doppler ultrasonography always perform surgeon distinguish muscle perforator skin perforator . Fluorescence angiography superficial exploration technique vascularization . After intravenous injection tracer ( indocyanine green ICG ) , fluorescence angiography provide useful surface angiographic image real-time . It also help monitor intraoperative postoperative quality vascular anastomosis . Although fluorescence angiography numerous application ( ophthalmology , neurosurgery , liver transplantation ... ) , usefulness surgical flap support publication . None really validate clinical value compare reference investigation ( CT angiography doppler ultrasonography ) . 40 candidate reconstructive surgery include study . The day surgery , addition usual technique use locate perforator flap , patient receive injection 0.025 mg / kg Infracyanine® ( indocyanine green ) area interest flap explore Fluobeam™ camera . Two hour surgery , usual clinical monitoring vitality flap , new injection Infracyanine® test perfusion flap measure fluorescence intensity target area . These measurement repeat every 6 hour 4 day .</detailed_description>
