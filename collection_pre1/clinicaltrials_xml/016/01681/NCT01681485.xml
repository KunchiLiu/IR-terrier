	<brief_title>Survey Chinese Medicine Syndrome Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cancer worldwide since 1985 term incidence mortality . According GLOBOCAN project World Health Organization ( WHO ) , 1.6 million new case ( 12.7 % total ) 1.4 million death ( 18.2 % total ) 2008 globally . Although prevalence rate already decrease male , increase trend female less developed country . From data Hong Kong Cancer Registry 2009 , 4,365 new case 3,692 death , represent 16.8 % 28.8 % cancer , respectively . Lung cancer divide small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) base biology , therapy , prognosis . NSCLC account 85 % lung cancer case include two major type : squamous cell ( epidermoid ) carcinoma nonsquamous carcinoma ( include adenocarcinoma , large-cell carcinoma cell type ) . Conventional treatment modality patient NSCLC include surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy . Surgery potentially curative therapeutic option , postoperative chemotherapy may provide additional benefit . However , NSCLC frequently diagnose advanced stage suitable surgery . Chemotherapy produce short-term improvement disease-related symptom , offer modest improvement median survival patient advanced-stage disease . Radiation therapy combine chemotherapy produce cure small number patient palliation others . Generally , NSCLC poor prognosis 15 % lung cancer patient alive 5 year diagnosis . Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) originate Chinese philosophy different medical system conventional western medicine . It focus health maintenance emphasize harmonize imbalance body . Related record cancer first find Yellow Emperor 's Inner Classic compile 200 B.C . 100 A.D. Nowadays , TCM increasingly use adjunctive treatment cancer patient . According survey carry Hong Kong Baptist University Queen Elizabeth Hospital 2008 , half cancer patient receive least one form TCM therapy . Current study also show TCM advantage increase sensitivity chemo- radio-therapeutics , reduce side effect chemo- radio-therapeutics associated complication , improve patient ' quality life survival time . However , TCM work conventional medicine treatment carcinoma still important research topic worldwide . Syndrome , essential concept TCM theory , diagnostic conclusion pathological change certain stage disease , include location , cause , nature well trend development . It derive symptom sign collect classic four diagnostic method , include observation , smell/listening , inquiry palpation . However , consensus definition diagnosis syndromes NSCLC different diagnostic treatment guideline publish TCM expert , college association . In practice , TCM practitioner use make diagnosis provide treatment basis experience . Therefore , consolidated evidence urge standardize diagnosis distribution syndrome routine practice research . Apart traditional syndrome study , advance study influence conventional treatment syndrome , correlation syndrome conventional measure do past decade . From review summarize syndrome change surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy , deficiency syndrome blood stasis syndrome fundamental syndrome pattern among cancer patient tongue manifestation significant early stage diagnosis , outcome assessment prognosis . A number study analyze distribution symptom NSCLC patient different TNM stage , cell type , assessment index , include quality life , immunological index hemorheology . However , cross-sectional epidemiological study short follow-up period . Therefore , impact factor syndromes completely elucidate . In present longitudinal study , patient new diagnose NSCLC follow two year . During period , change pattern TCM syndromes patient conventional treatment , include surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy analyze . Furthermore , correlation TCM syndromes quality life progress-free survival also investigate . We hope result study provide consolidated evidence effect conventional treatment TCM syndrome , standardize diagnosis TCM syndromes NSCLC clinical practice , promote research integrate medicine NSCLC .</detailed_description>
