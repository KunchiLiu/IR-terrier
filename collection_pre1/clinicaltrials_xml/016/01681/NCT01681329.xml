	<brief_summary>Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) condition characterize chronic excessive worry anxiety . Our group develop cognitive-behavioural treatment ( CBT ) GAD test four previous clinical trial . The finding show 60 70 % affected individual attain GAD remission 50 55 % achieve high endstate function follow treatment . Although number encourage , remain considerable proportion individual fully benefit treatment . In recent CIHR-funded treatment study , assess impact information processing efficacy CBT GAD . Our finding show : ) tendency negatively interpret ambiguous information pre-treatment associate great GAD symptom post-treatment ; b ) patient less successful change negative interpretation style also less responsive CBT . Given computerize interpretation modification train show effective decrease negative interpretation style anxious individual , goal current proposal determine whether train augment efficacy CBT adult GAD . A total 138 individual primary diagnosis GAD randomly allocate one two condition : ) CBT plus interpretation modification training b ) CBT plus non-active training . CBT consist 14 weekly session , interpretation modification training ( non-active training ) administer prior session . Measures GAD symptom , psychopathology , cognitive vulnerability , interpretation style administer pre- , mid- , post-treatment , well 6- 12-month follow-up . The propose study provide information efficacy , clinical usefulness , mechanisms interpretation modification train combination CBT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) characterize excessive uncontrollable worry anxiety . In Canada , point prevalence GAD 3 4 % , personal social cost GAD well document . Over past decade , new cognitive-behavioural treatment develop GAD . Our group also develop cognitive-behavioural treatment ( CBT ) protocol GAD , focus intolerance uncertainty . There four publish randomize clinical trial treatment , result suggest efficacious wait-list control , supportive therapy , apply relaxation . Although result encourage , 30 40 % affected individual attain diagnostic remission 45 50 % achieve high endstate function post-treatment . In effort augment efficacy treatment protocol GAD , recently examine broad range demographic clinical variable might predict limited response treatment . The result analyse suggest particular type cognitive bias play key role determine treatment response . Specifically , patient particularly negative interpretation style ( i.e. , tendency negatively interpret ambiguous information ) great probability attain remission follow CBT ( also show less improvement indicator treatment outcome ) . In addition , change interpretation style appear mediate change GAD symptom course CBT . Thus , data suggest treatment efficacy could increase add train strategy specifically address negatively biased interpretation ambiguous information . Recently , number experimental investigation show tendency negatively interpret ambiguous information decrease use computerized interpretation modification training . In fact , data show change maintain time , generalize new situation , lead corresponding change GAD symptom anxiety proneness . Thus , appear computerized interpretation modification train potential increase efficacy current CBT protocol directly target decrease tendency negatively interpret ambiguous information . The propose randomized clinical trial address follow question : Can computerize interpretation modification training augment efficacy CBT GAD ? A total 138 individual primary diagnosis GAD randomly allocate one two condition : ) CBT plus interpretation modification training ( CBT+IMT ) b ) CBT plus non-active training ( CBT+NA ) . CBT consist 14 weekly 50-minute session target intolerance uncertainty via procedure problem-solving train imaginal exposure . Participants randomize experimental condition receive 10 minute computerized interpretation modification train prior CBT session . In interpretation modification training , respondent learn endorse benign combination reject negative combination sentence word , thus promote new associative learning . Participants control condition receive 10 minute non-active training , sentence pair word unrelated sentence word relate non-threatening ( typically peripheral ) aspect sentence . Measures GAD symptom , psychopathology , cognitive vulnerability , interpretation style administer pre- , mid- , post-treatment , well 6- 12-month follow-up . The propose study provide information efficacy , clinical usefulness , mechanisms interpretation modification train combination CBT . Given previous finding key role negative interpretation style anxiety , propose study potential increase understand ability treat individual GAD .</detailed_description>
