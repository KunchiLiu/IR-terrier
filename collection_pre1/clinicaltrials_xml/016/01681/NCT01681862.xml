	<brief_summary>High blood pressure number one cause death Blacks United States . A major reason high rate cardiovascular death poor blood pressure control . Improving blood pressure control lead large reduction cardiovascular death Blacks achieve intervention target self-management behavior . Yet , despite proven benefit intervention , little evidence role community-based setting . In NYC , Department Health Mental Hygiene ( DOHMH ) develop Keep Track , volunteer-run , community program aim low blood pressure old adult blood pressure monitoring session , brief counsel health education . With support DOHMH , lay health worker faith-based organization senior center take blood pressure reading community member , record reading index card provide counsel support lifestyle change health care access . However , lay health worker administrate program report difficulty manage volume track card , express interest better tool manage information . To address limitation , primary aim study test feasibility implement Personal Health Record ( PHR ) system two predominately Black church NYC help lay health worker track change blood pressure health behavior participate congregant . The secondary aim evaluate effect PHR system change blood pressure , physical activity , weight loss , fruit vegetable intake , number visit primary care physician baseline 9 month . The investigator hypothesize congregant enroll PHR system great reduction BP ; increase intake fruit vegetable level physical activity ; weight loss ; report great number visit doctor 9 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor blood pressure ( BP ) control major contributor racial disparity HTN among Blacks ; odds poor BP control 40 % high among Blacks compare Whites . Improving BP control lead significant cardiovascular risk reduction Blacks achieve evidence-based intervention target self-management behavior coordinate primary care `` medical neighborhood '' . Despite efficacy intervention , widely disseminate community-based setting , link `` community resource '' primary care clinic . The challenge local health department redesign evidence-based approach function level resource skill available typical community-based organization ( CBO ) . Health IT could build capacity CBOs implement evidence-based model , allow broad translation life-saving intervention , lay foundation coordination care people HTN . In New York City , Department Health Mental Hygiene ( NYC DOHMH ) develop Keep Track ( KOT ) - volunteer-run program design low BP old adult biweekly BP monitoring session health education . With technical material support DOHMH , lay health worker ( LHW ) senior center faith-based organization take BP reading community member , record reading index card provide brief counsel support lifestyle change healthcare access . A limitation program use paper BP tracking card , LHWs find difficult efficiently review purpose target outreach referral . They express interest alternative tool information management , would conducive organize outreach church member high BP , support effort lifestyle change attempt gain access high quality healthcare . In order address important limitation , investigator assess feasibility implement Personal Health Record ( PHR ) system Congregational Dashboard customize support KOT LHWs two predominately Black church NYC track individual aggregate change BP health behavior among participate congregant . The investigator propose PHR implementation could improve capacity Health Ministry manage information heighten impact KOT . Specifically investigator propose PHR implementation could improve community-based BP control program enable LHWs adopt element Chronic Care Model:1 ) target outreach participate congregant need support health behavior change ; 2 ) collaborative goal-setting individual church-level ; 3 ) empower member gain access healthcare present physician BP track report . Primary Aim : To assess feasibility implement customize PHR system support church-based BP monitoring program two predominately Black church New York City . Secondary Aims : To evaluate effect implement PHR system : 1 . Changes systolic diastolic BP baseline 9 month 2 . Changes daily serving fruit vegetable ; level physical activity ; within-participant weight loss ; number visit primary care physician ( PCP ) baseline 9 month Hypothesis : Congregants enroll PHR system exhibit reduction BP ; increase intake fruit vegetable level physical activity ; within-participant weight loss ; report great number visit PCP 9 month . Outcomes primary secondary aim assess church- individual-levels . An ongoing formative evaluation conduct identify barrier facilitator PHR implementation , garner suggestion improvement . Data collect formative evaluation inform necessary system modification continuous refinement . A process evaluation also conduct RE-AIM framework . BP assess validate automated BP monitor base American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline . Health behavior assess well-validated self-report measure ; weight loss estimate difference weight baseline 9 month .</detailed_description>
