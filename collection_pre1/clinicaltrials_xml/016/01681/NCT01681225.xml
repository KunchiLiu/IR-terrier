	<brief_summary>This phase II multi-centered , randomize control trial mechanical ventilation direct esophageal pressure measurement test primary hypothesis use strategy maintain minimal positive transpulmonary pressure ( Ptp = airway pressure minus pleural pressure ) throughout ventilatory cycle lead improvement patient survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EPVent 2- A Phase II Study Mechanical Ventilation Directed Transpulmonary Pressures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II prospective randomize controlled trial ventilation direct esophageal pressure measurement enroll 200 patient moderate severe ARDS Berlin conference definition several academic medical center North America . The control group ventilate use alternative high-PEEP strategy PEEP FiO2 set use empiric table . Plasma sample obtain enrollment day 3 7 assessed variety lung injury biomarkers well ass association intervention inflammation associate mechanical ventilation development ARDS . Hospital survivor undergo brief follow phone survey ass survival , functional status ( Barthel Index ) , health-related QOL ( Short Form 12 ) , frailty ( VES ) twelve month enrollment . The study length six year six month start-up period follow planned 50 month enrollment twelve month follow-up .</detailed_description>

Hypoxemic respiratory failure PaO2 / FIO2 ratio &lt; 200 mmHg 2. b ) Bilateral alveolar/interstitial infiltrates chest xray , opacities present 7 day 3 . Respiratory failure fully explain cardiac failure fluid overload 4 . Intubation control ventilation receive PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O Age 16 year old Duration ARDS 36 hour less meet final Berlin criterion . Received mechanical ventilation 96 hour Recently treat bleeding varix , esophageal stricture , hematemesis , esophageal trauma , recent esophageal surgery contraindication nasogastric tube placement Severe coagulopathy ( platelet count &lt; 5000/microliter INR &gt; 4 ) History lung transplantation Elevated intracranial pressure condition hypercapniainduced elevation intracranial pressure avoid Evidence active air leak lung commit full support Participation intervention trial ARDS sepsis within past 30 day . Neuromuscular disease impairs ability ventilate spontaneously Severe chronic liver disease , define ChildPugh Score ≥12 Treating clinician refusal , unwillingness commit control ventilation least 24 hour Inability get inform consent patient surrogate . Use rescue therapy prior enrollment ( e.g . nitric oxide , ECMO , prone positioning , high frequency oscillation ) . This exclude case therapy use initial mode ventilation</criteria>
