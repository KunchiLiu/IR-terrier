	<brief_summary>Cervix carcinoma common malignancy . Radiation therapy still remain major treatment patient carcinoma cervix . Conventional treatment radiation therapy include combination external beam radiation therapy intracavitary treatment . Low dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy treatment already well study . But high dose rate brachytherapy relatively new alternative . In brachytherapy , major development make integration 3D image computerized 3D treatment planning . Medical imaging improvement allow good definition tumoral volume organ risk . The GYN GEC-ESTRO publish recommendation 3D image good characterization volume . Improvements CT-SCan lately RMN lead good definition volums interest ( tumor extension organ risk : bladder , rectum , sigmoidis , small bowel ) . RMN image standard evaluation tumoral extension cervix cancer . However use easy many brachytherapy department . This study evaluate feasibility spar organ risk high dose rate brachytherapy volume delineation do two session perform 3D RMN .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After 60 Gy deliver Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) , brachytherapy high dose rate deliver 15 Gy CTVhr ( high risk CTV ) two session . A clinical examination RMN perform end external radiation evaluate residual tumoral volume . Two HDR brachytherapy session perform . During first session , CT-Scan RMN perform fletcher application . A second CT-Scan perform second treatment session create new volume improve organ risk spar .</detailed_description>
