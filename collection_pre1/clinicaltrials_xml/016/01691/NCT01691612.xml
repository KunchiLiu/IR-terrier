	<detailed_description>The investigator test hypothesis Pin1 regulate TLR/IL-1R signal pathway asthma examine Pin1 related pathway activation BAL-derived eosinophils house dust mite allergen challenge . The investigator perform segmental allergen challenge . BAL lung biopsy allergen-challenged segment perform 48 hr later activation Pin1 relate pathway examine .</detailed_description>
