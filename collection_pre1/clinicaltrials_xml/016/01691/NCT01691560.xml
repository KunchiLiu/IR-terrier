	<criteria>1 . Participants 18 55 year age , good general health , preexist selfreported clinically diagnose tooth sensitivity require entry study 2 . Participants require least four teeth facial/cervical erosion , abrasion and/or gingival recession respond qualify evaporative ( air ) assessment Screening visit least two teeth ( incisor , canine premolar ) demonstrate sign sensitivity , measure qualify tactile threshold ( Yeaple ≤ 20 gram ( g ) ) evaporative ( air ) ( Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2 ) assessment Baseline visit 1 . Pregnancy : Women know pregnant intend become pregnant duration study . 2 . Breastfeeding : Women breastfeed . 3 . Medical History : ) Chronic debilitate disease present b ) Chronic disease condition present associate intermittent episode constant daily pain , arthritis , low back pain , dysmenorrhea , etc . 4 . Medications : Daily dos medication , opinion investigator , might interfere perception pain , take . Examples medication include analgesic , anticonvulsant , antihistamine cause mark moderate sedation , sedative , tranquilizer , moodaltering antiinflammatory drug . 5 . Dentition Exclusions : ) Sensitive teeth expect respond treatment overthe counter dentifrice opinion investigator . b ) Teeth expose dentine deep , defective facial restoration , teeth use abutment fix removable partial denture , teeth full crown , orthodontic band , extensive caries crack enamel . Sensitive teeth contribute etiology erosion , abrasion recession expose dentine . c ) Dental professional hygiene ( include dental prophylaxis , irrigation , intensive antimicrobial/antibiotic therapy ) within 14 day screen visit . ) Presence dental implant . e ) Lip tongue piercings . f ) Periodontal surgical history within past 6 month scale /root plan within past 3 month . 6 . Allergy/Intolerance : Known suspected intolerance hypersensitivity study material ( closely relate compound ) state ingredient . 7 . Clinical Study/Experimental Medication : ) Participation another clinical study receipt investigational drug within 30 day screen visit b ) Previous participation study . 8 .
