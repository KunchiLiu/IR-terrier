	<brief_title>Investigating Lower Limb Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In set severe trauma , decision whether amputate save limb common , extremely difficult make . Due improve reconstructive surgical technique currently clear criterion amputation . Although limb salvage appear desirable situation , numerous article scientific literature show associate increased pain , complication , duration hospital stay , rehabilitation time , overall cost . These factor may acceptable patient benefit improved functional outcome . However , study compare amputation limb salvage consistently report significant difference functional outcome two group . A major limitation methodology fore mention study use self-reported questionnaire determine functional outcome . Questionnaires subjective , often lack specificity , therefore may truly representative functional outcome . Furthermore , lack useful information long-term post-operative care prevents adaption optimisation rehabilitation strategy . The investigator plan use wearable sensor develop objective mobility assessment tool patient either amputation limb salvage surgery low limb trauma . This would result reliable accurate comparison , may help healthcare professional make informed decision amputation limb salvage future .</detailed_description>
