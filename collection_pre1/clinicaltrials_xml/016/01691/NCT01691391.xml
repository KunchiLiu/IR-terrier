	<brief_summary>3rd line standard treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) harbor K-ras wild type consist anti-EGFR treatment either cetuximab panitumumab . This type treatment modest significant beneficial activity patient group improve progression-free overall survival . Although well know patient advance CRC harbor K-Ras mutation respond anti-EGFR treatment , understood patient K-Ras wild type CRC benefit type therapy . In order optimize treatment patient well health care cost , extremely important identify patient respond treatment EGFR inhibitor early stage . The investigator hypothesize difference response treatment cetuximab due variability pharmacokinetics -dynamics antibody . Thus , investigator hypothesize patient respond anti-EGFR treatment , insufficient drug level tumor tissue . The investigator hypothesize due pharmacodynamic process sequestration cetuximab liver express high level EGF receptor . With introduction immuno-positron emission tomography ( PET ) , attractive novel option visualize molecular interaction develop use combination PET label mAbs . Cetuximab label zirconium-89 ( 89Zr ) successfully generate ( GMP ) available study . Previous study show excellent stability compound 89Zr show safe human . The investigator use 89Zr-cetuximab demonstrate tumor target image explore relation uptake treatment response . With approach investigator hope achieve well understanding mechanisms action therapeutic mAb metastasize CRC eventually develop strategy may improve efficacy cetuximab treatment .</brief_summary>
