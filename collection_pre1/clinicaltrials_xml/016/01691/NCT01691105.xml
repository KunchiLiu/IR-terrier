	<brief_summary>This study implement test effectiveness cost-effectiveness tobacco cessation intervention ( Academic Detailing + Integrated Tobacco Order Set - AD + ITOS ) adult admit hospital . The intervention begin hospital stay continue discharge . The intervention use resource easily available acute care hospital : computerize physician order entry , physician nurse education , staff meeting physician , nurse ally health professional , online learn capability , fax primary care provider ( PCPs ) , telephone counsel support available state smoker ' quitline ( QL ) . The investigator hypothesize subject intervention arm ( AD + ITOS ) likely achieve tobacco abstinence 12 month post hospital stay subject control arm ( Academic Detailing - AD ) . Tobacco abstinence assess self report biochemical verification ( exhaled carbon monoxide read ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking remain leading cause preventable death illness United States . In 2008 , 20.6 % American adult smoke , 435,000 die smoking-related illness . Economic cost smoke dependence estimate $ 193 billion/year far-reaching implication individual , workplace , society healthcare system . However , treatment associate significant individual society benefit , counsel pharmacotherapy demonstrate effective treatment . Along poverty low education , smoke cause great loss quality-adjusted life year race , uninsurance , overweight , binge drinking . Smokers admit acute care hospital nonsmoker . Using estimate number source , estimate approximately 6.1-12.5 million hospitalization occur annually among adult smoker . This represent 20-41 % 29.8 million annual inpatient stay US acute care hospital among adult age 18 older unrelated pregnancy childbirth . Put another way , nation 's 46 million smoker represent 20 % adult population , account 20-40 % hospitalization unrelated pregnancy . Given US hospital smoke-free ( per Joint Commission regulation ) , many admission tobacco-related condition , hospital admission represent profound opportunity—a `` teachable moment '' —for tobacco control . Recent `` core measure '' regulation Joint Commission Centers Medicare Medicaid Services require hospital report publicly tobacco screen patient admit acute myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , pneumonia . Although many hospital improve performance considerably smoke measure , sometimes result `` gaming , '' e.g . give discharged patient preprinted instruction sheet include boilerplate text smoking cessation . Thus , although hospital assess inpatient tobacco use ( either nurse assessment physician 's initial history physical examination ) , often system place initiate sustain tobacco treatment smoker . This gap service delivery prevent million smoker access many effective , evidence-based treatment tobacco dependence period may particularly receptive intervention . Hence , overarch goal project implement study effectiveness cost-effectiveness tobacco intervention hospitalize adult begin inpatient treatment continue discharge . To enhance dissemination , use resource currently available acute care hospital : computerize physician order entry , physician nurse education , staff meeting physician , nurse , ally health professional , online learn capability , fax primary care provider ( PCPs ) , telephone counsel support available state smoker ' quitline ( QL ) . In final year , toolkit disseminate professional society . We hypothesize propose intervention clinically effective , cost effective , sustainable , generalizable . All intervention evidence-based consistent 2008 Public Health Service clinical practice guideline tobacco dependence treatment . The Specific Aims propose project : Primary Aims : 1 . Determine whether Academic Detailing ( AD ) Integrated Tobacco Order Set ( ITOS ) compare AD alone improve biologically verify smoke cessation 12 month post-quit cohort 960 smoker age &gt; 18 year admit Yale New Haven Hospital ( YNHH ) . Secondary Aims : 2 . Study ITOS 's ability encourage smoker use treatment service reduce consumption . 3 . Study ITOS 's ability enhance provider delivery tobacco screen treatment . 4 . Conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analysis intervention . Our associated hypothesis : 1 . Subjects treat physician AD+ITOS arm high rate biochemically verify 7-day point prevalence smoke abstinence 12 month post-quit subject treat physician AD arm , cohort adult smoker admit inpatient unit Yale-New Haven Hospital . 2 . Subjects treat AD+ITOS physician make quit attempt , experience great reduction daily cigarette consumption , smoker treat AD physician . 3 . A high proportion patient treat AD+ITOS physician tobacco treatment initiated hospital patient treat AD physician . 4 . Societal cost AD+ITOS , per abstinent smoker , cost-effective relative AD .</detailed_description>
