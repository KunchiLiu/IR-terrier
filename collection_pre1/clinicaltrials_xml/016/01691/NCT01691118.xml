	<detailed_description>Approximately half hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction diastolic dysfunction associate development congestive heart failure increase mortality . The Framingham study report 51 % patient HF preserve leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction hypertension strong risk factor HF preserve ejection fraction , also term diastolic heart failure . The rate death morbidity patient high patient HF low LV ejection fraction . Hypertensive patient increase risk develop LV hypertrophy myocardial fibrosis , cause relaxation abnormality decrease compliance LV rise LV diastolic pressure . Although HF associate hypertension clinically significant problem , clinical trial conduct proven pharmacological therapy improve outcome . Because activation rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) show induce LV hypertrophy myocardial fibrosis , RAAS may play central role pathogenic process hypertension diastolic HF . Inhibitors RAAS consider treatment option patient , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) interest antagonize effect angiotensin II completely . The large clinical trial , Irbesartan Heart Failure Preserved Systolic Function ( I-PRESERVE ) , recently report treatment irbesartan reduce risk death hospitalization cardiovascular cause among 4,128 patient HF preserve LV ejection fraction . The negative result observe I-PRESERVE trial may consequence follow possible factor . First , trial may target patient disease process advance ARBs effective . Second , irbesartan may appropriate ARB HF trial , ARBs term clinical outcome data patient HF . Irbesartan outcome data reduce HF hospitalization high-risk hypertensive patient telmisartan show benefit compare placebo patient , although candesartan valsartan significantly reduce endpoint placebo-controlled trial . Telmisartan irbesartan PPARγ activity activity might neutralize beneficial effect ARB HF , well know PPARγ agonist , rosiglitazone , increase incidence HF significantly . Evaluating effect treatment diastolic dysfunction limit difficulty non-invasive measure LV diastolic pressure , recent advance echocardiography make possible assess diastolic dysfunction accurately reproducibly . Thus , additional clinical study ARBs need hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction assessment diastolic function echocardiography helpful determine whether addition ARB standard therapy beneficial hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction . Fimasartan first ARB develop Korea , felt particularly appropriate examine hypothesis ARB improve diastolic dysfunction associate hypertension , fimasartan potent well-tolerated ARB . To best knowledge , randomize trial demonstrate antihypertensive drug improve diastolic function hypertensive patient diastolic dysfunction . We hypothesize fimasartan added standard therapy superior placebo improve diastolic dysfunction mildly symptomatic patient hypertension diastolic dysfunction , try examine hypothesis double-blind , randomize comparison study use echocardiography .</detailed_description>
