	<brief_summary>MCI age thought part relate reduced serum sex hormone well-recognised , especially female , poorly understood . International study assess hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) prevent/reduce MCI ongoing . MCI lead morbidity , reduce quality life substantial healthcare cost . The common therapeutically induced reduction sex hormone level men treatment prostate cancer ( PCa ) . PCa androgen dependent androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) suppress testosterone castrate level key therapy advance disease . About one million men worldwide receive ADT PCa , mostly use luteinising hormone releasing-hormone agonist ( LHRHa ) although oral oestrogen use past ; eventually perhaps 4 % Caucasians may castrate . MCI side-effect castration men remain poorly research . This pilot study quantify extent MCI men receive ADT LHRHa oestrogen inform design large study understand mechanism , predict affected patient determine way reduce MCI . Researching relationship sex hormone MCI improve understanding intervention slowing/preventing MCI PCa survivor . HRT woman slow MCI . Alternatives ADT include parenteral oestrogen . The PATCH clinical trial compare transdermal oestrogen LHRHa offer opportunity ass oestrogen preventative male MCI . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , quantitative electroencephalography ( qEEG ) neuropsychological test use test hypothesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Changes cognitive function relate alter serum sex hormone level well-recognised poorly understood . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) age think part relate reduction serum androgen level international study on-going prevent age-related MCI use androgen replacement therapy . Reduction cognitive function often lead morbidity reduction quality life . The common therapeutically induced reduction sex hormone level men treatment prostate cancer . As prostate cancer androgen dependent growth , androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) suppress serum testosterone level castration level ( &lt; 1.7mM ) key therapeutic intervention advance disease . Up 1 million men worldwide estimate prescribed ADT prostate cancer , mostly use luteinising hormone release hormone agonist ( LHRHa ) . ADT also use treat early prostate cancer early asymptomatic prostate cancer increasingly diagnose treat follow screen serum PSA measurement , estimate suggest eventually 4 % Caucasians castrate . MCI recognize side effect ADT little work do quantify effect , understand mechanism , predict patient affect determine way reduce side effect . Researching relationship sex hormone MCI improve understanding intervention slowing/preventing MCI PCa survivor . Hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) woman slow development MCI . Alternatives ADT include parenteral oestrogen . The PATCH clinical trial compare transdermal oestrogen LHRHa offer opportunity ass oestrogen preventative male MCI . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , quantitative electroencephalography ( qEEG ) neuropsychological test use test hypothesis . Insight effect change serum sex hormone MCI may provide guide improve MCI age improve quality life prostate cancer survivor . This study aim ( ) measure cognitive change prostate cancer patient receive ADT either LHRHa transdermal oestrogen ( ii ) relate MCI change serum hormone level . Simultaneous high-resolution fMRI brain 64-channel qEEG use first time patient group . MCI investigate assess change parietal lobe activation mental rotation task change global resting-state fMRI qEEG activity comparison make cognitive assessment carry neuropsychological test .</detailed_description>
