	<brief_summary>This double-blind placebo-controlled study plan study 40 competitive endurance athlete . We conduct exercise test evaluate maximal oxygen uptake 2 exercise challenge test provoke EIA . Prior exercise challenge test athletes randomly receive inhale placebo inhaled ipratropium bromide . We compare athlete ' airway response exercise challenge without active drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise-induced asthma ( EIA ) common often unrecognized among endurance athlete . The mechanisms asthma appear different athlete non-athletes , occurrence asthma high among endurance athlete seem promoted training . This suggest factor inherent athleticism , parasympathetic nervous system , show change endurance training know lead narrowing airway , may involve development asthma athlete . Although asthma mechanism treatment extensively study classic asthmatic , limited data athlete . This double-blind placebo-controlled study plan study 40 competitive endurance athlete . We conduct exercise test evaluate maximal oxygen uptake 2 exercise challenge test provoke EIA . Prior exercise challenge test athletes randomly receive inhale placebo inhaled ipratropium bromide . We compare athlete ' airway response exercise challenge without active drug . If ipratropium bromide prove prevent EIA athlete , drug may appropriate effective target EIA population . The result study may lead improved clinical management athlete asthma .</detailed_description>
