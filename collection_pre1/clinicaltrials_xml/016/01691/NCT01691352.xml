	<detailed_description>Countless child undergo surgery annually management clinician consider `` dirty wound '' . These include case patient know intraabdominal infection enteric content likely contaminate surgical field . One frequently encountered example ostomy reversal . During planned operation , previously divert small bowel colon reconnected distal intestine , restore continuity . However , procedure leave open wound anterior abdominal wall , create conundrum surgeon raise question : wound manage ? Historically , surgeon would close ostomy site primary fashion use run subcuticular suture . While `` national standard '' wound closure ostomy , concern likelihood local wound infection lead modern day practitioner leave wind open drain fashion . Still technique use varies use simple interrupted suture along wound incision use betadine soak gauze `` wick '' wound . Other surgeon attempt close ostomy site delay fashion , 48-72 hour primary operation . Limited research prospectively perform evaluate compare merit technique . In child , recent data directly address question . In practice CHOA , surgeon utilize wick non-wicked wound dressing . Our current wound infection rate approximately 10 % , define spread redness , drain pu , fever , increase wound tenderness perioperative period . Unfortunately , type dressing place end operation rarely , ever document operative note , therefore retrospective review ass outcomes feasible . While exact statistic many ostomy close use wick versus non-wicked dressing , survey 7 physician , approximately 50 % attend report place wick patient remain attending use wick rare exception particularly `` dirty wound '' ( i.e . significant spillage stool wind grossly necrotic/infected tissue ) particularly deep wound . Clinicians elect use wick adopt practice base person opinion allow wound drain well , thus prevent infection . Those place wick state feel unnecessary step dress interrupted suture alone sufficient allow wound drain . After lengthy discussion surgeon Egleston 4 surgeon Scottish Rite , department , decide evaluate type dress use ostomy closure order see fact benefit leave wick ostomy wound . All surgeon agree participate study without undo bias . In prospective randomize trial , wish evaluate two dressing child receive ostomy closure . Our hypothesis incidence wound infection ostomy reversal regardless wick place .</detailed_description>
