	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Healthy male and/or female subject nonchild bear potential age 18 55 year , inclusive ( Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test ) . 2 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . 3 . An informed consent document sign date subject . 4 . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . A positive urine drug screen . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week female 14 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement , whichever long ) 5 half life precede first dose study medication . Screening supine blood pressure &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) &gt; =90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , single measurement ( confirm per local SOP ) . 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 QRS interval &gt; 120 msec Screening . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc value use determine subject 's eligibility . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos &lt; =1 g/day . Limited use non prescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis follow approval sponsor . Herbal supplement hormonal method contraception ( include oral transdermal contraceptive , injectable progesterone , progestin subdermal implant , progesteronereleasing IUDs postcoital contraceptive method ) hormone replacement therapy must discontinue least 28 day prior first dose study medication . Blood donation ( exclude plasma donation ) approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle Guidelines describe protocol . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study . History seizure condition risk seizure . ( A history 1 febrile seizure childhood exclude subject . ) Use tobacco nicotinecontaining product excess equivalent 5 cigarette per day .</criteria>
