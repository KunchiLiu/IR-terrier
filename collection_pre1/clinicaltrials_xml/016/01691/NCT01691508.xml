	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study mepolizumab comparison placebo reduce Oral Corticosteroid ( OCS ) use subject severe refractory asthma . The study consist four phase , OCS Optimisation Phase ( Week -8 Week 0 ) , double-blind treatment period divide Induction Phase ( Week 0 Week 4 ) , OCS Reduction Phase ( Week 5 upto Week 20 ) follow Maintenance Phase ( Week 20 Week 24 ) . During Optimisation Phase investigator adjust OCS ( prednisone/prednisolone ) dose accord Optimisation titration schedule base review Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) -5 score exacerbation . In Induction Phase subject randomize 1:1 ( approximately 60 per arm ) receive either mepolizumab ( 100 mg ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) placebo every 4 week addition exist maintenance asthma therapy low dose OCS Optimisation Phase . The Induction Phase allow sufficient time subject randomise mepolizumab arm achieve decrease eosinophilic inflammation prior reduction OCS . During Reduction Phase , subject continue receive 100 mg mepolizumab/placebo every 4 week OCS dose reduction do every 4 week use reduction titration schedule base review eDiary parameter record subject , subject ' exacerbation history , review sign symptoms adrenal insufficiency . In Maintenance Phase subject maintain without OCS dose adjustment . Subjects complete 24 week double-blind period meet eligibility criterion , offer opportunity participate open label extension ( OLE ) study otherwise return Follow-up Visit 12 week last dose double blind study treatment . At clinic visit , adverse event , safety lab , spirometery parameter exacerbation assess . The pharmacokinetic sample collect begin treatment , prior last dose , end study ( exit visit ) follow .</brief_summary>
