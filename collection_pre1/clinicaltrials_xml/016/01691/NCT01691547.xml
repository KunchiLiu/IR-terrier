	<brief_summary>This double-blind , single dose ( four inhalation ) , four-way cross study healthy subject assess systemic pharmacokinetics ( PK ) systemic pharmacodynamics ( PD ) Fluticasone Furoate , ( FF ) , Umeclidinium , ( UMEC ) Vilanterol ( VI ) . Study drug deliver novel single-step activation dry powder inhaler ( NDPI ) two strip configuration . The NDPI configure different combination compound also new blend UMEC/VI inhalation powder within single strip NDPI device . Study drug administer inhaled route healthy subject single dos ( four inhalation ) . Each subject receive treatment randomize order Treatment A FF ( 400 microgram [ µg ] ) UMEC ( 500 µg ) /VI ( 100 µg ) , Treatment B UMEC ( 500 µg ) VI ( 100 µg ) , Treatment C FF ( 400 µg ) VI ( 100 µg ) Treatment D FF ( 400 µg ) UMEC ( 500 µg ) four treatment period . Each treatment period separate washout 7 21 day . After four treatment period , follow visit take place 7 21 day follow final dose study medication maximum duration subject involve study eighteen week . Pharmacokinetics assess measurement plasma urine concentration FF , UMEC VI . Safety PD monitor use blood glucose , serum potassium , heart rate , 12-lead ECGs clinical laboratory test . Plasma sample PK collect throughout study , urine , blood glucose , serum potassium , heart rate , 12-lead ECGs clinical laboratory test assess Day 1 . AEs assess throughout study .</brief_summary>
