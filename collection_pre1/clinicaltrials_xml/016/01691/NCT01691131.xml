	<brief_summary>Introduction : There evidence demonstrate beneficial effect pulmonary rehabilitation program ( PR ) symptom , exercise capacity , muscle strength quality life patient Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The majority study use high intensity endurance strength exercise training land . Exercise water effective form training use decade rehabilitation different chronic condition . In addition , promise preliminary result literature regard aquatic training patient COPD . However , several gap remain . Aim : Compare effect two rehabilitation program 6 month duration patient COPD physical activity daily life balance : land versus water . Methods : The sample consist 60 patient COPD diagnose accord GOLD criterion , 50 year old clinically stable . Patients evaluate 3 different moment : PR , PR 6 month end PR ( follow ) . In addition assessment physical activity daily life balance , investigator also evaluate pulmonary function , peripheral respiratory muscle strength , body composition , maximal submaximal exercise capacity , functional status quality life . Both group ( land water ) submit 3 session exercise train per week , 45 minute duration , 6 month . The session group include exercise sequence . Endurance exercise training perform bicycle walk land strength train use free weight . Workload establish accord test performance assessment progression follow predetermine schedule adjust accord symptom . On water approach follow . Expected result : investigator expect improvement term symptom , exercise capacity , muscle strength , quality life , functional status physical activity daily life end two training protocol . However , unclear whether one training protocol superior . Due characteristic involve aquatic training , investigator hypothesize type training result well result balance .</brief_summary>
