	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn variability proptosis measurement . Measurements record use Hertel exophthalmometer . This noninvasive tool instrument design measure forward protrusion eye may use normally general eye exam . This instrument provide method evaluate record progression regression prominence eye cause disorder thyroid disease tumor orbit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability Hertel Exophthalmometer Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . In order determine intrauser reliability Hertel exophthalmometer , patient 2 independent exam use Hertel exophthalmometer day perform researcher ( either DAC HLP ) blind fashion . For patient , independently measure base value value right leave eye proptosis , respectively , use Hertel exophthalmometer . A randomization process employ determine researcher ( either DAC HLP ) take first set measurement . The distance observer patient standardized measurement . Patient research data de-identified recorded patient subsequently analyze interobserver reliability . Aim 2 . In order determine interuser reliability Hertel exophthalmometer , patient second independent exam day second observer determine Aim 1 . For patient , independently measure base value value right leave eye proptosis , respectively , use Hertel exophthalmometer . The distance observer patient standardized measurement . Patient research data de-identified recorded patient subsequently analyze interobserver reliability . Aim 3 . Variability Hertel measurement may relate large part difference base measurement . The base measurement determine bony orbital structure significantly affect time soft tissue remodel commonly see TED orbital disease process . We second observer re-measure patient use Hertel exophthalmometer begin base measurement determine first observer . Again , measurement distance standardize . No information provide second observer begin base measurement . Patient research data de-identified prior record information subsequently analyze determine begin base improve interobserver reliability .</detailed_description>
