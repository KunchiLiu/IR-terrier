	<brief_summary>The objective study assess daily variation bronchodilator response inhale short act beta2-agonist ( albuterol/salbutamol ) inhale short act anticholinergic ( ipratropium ) individually use combination subject COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Look Day Day Changes Lung Function COPD Subjects Taking Albuterol/Salbutamol Ipratropium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beta2-agonist anticholinergic principle component pharmacologic management chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD . It demonstrate combination short act beta2-agonist short act anticholinergic yield great efficacy measure FEV1 compare response individual short act bronchodilator . However , daily bronchial response agent poorly understood . It also poorly understood variation magnitude response individual agent variation response one agent coincide variation response agent . This study seek define pattern response individual agent relationship . The study also explore combination two agent lead less variation response compare individual agent . This randomized , open label , two period cross-over study . Eligible subject randomize sequence either albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) follow ipratropium via MDI dose bronchodilator give opposite order . Each study period consist 10 clinic visit conduct 10 14 day .</detailed_description>
