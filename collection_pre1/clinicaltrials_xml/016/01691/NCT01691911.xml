	<brief_summary>Major vascular surgery involve operation repair swell blood vessel , clear debris block artery bypass block blood vessel . Patients problem high-risk surgical group generalize blood vessel disease . These put risk major complication around time surgery heart attack , stroke death . The mortality follow repair swollen main artery abdomen 1 20 . This contrast poorly 1 per 100 risk death follow heart bypass . Simple cost-effective method need reduce risk major vascular surgery . Remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) may technique . To induce RIPC , blood supply muscle patient 's arm interrupt 5 minute . It restore five minute . This cycle repeat three time . The blood supply interrupt simply inflate blood pressure cuff maximum pressure . This repeated brief interruption muscular blood supply send signal critical organ brain heart , render temporarily resistant damage reduce blood supply . Several small randomize clinical trial patient undergo different type major vascular surgery demonstrate potential benefit . This large , multi-centre trial aim determine whether RIPC reduce complication routine practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The demand major vascular surgery increase [ 1 ] . Patients require procedure aortic aneurysm repair , carotid endarterectomy , low limb surgical re-vascularisation major low limb amputation end-stage vascular disease constitute high-risk surgical cohort . Peri-operative complication myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , renal failure death common [ 2,3 ] . Multiple potential mechanism may result complication . For example , myocardial injury may result systemic hypotension lead reduce flow across tight coronary artery stenosis , alternatively , may arise due acute occlusion unstable plaque rupture . Most strategy aim peri-operative risk reduction target single potential mechanism . For example , beta-blockade may prevent myocardial injury due overwork , prevent acute coronary occlusion . There requirement simple , effective intervention protects tissues injury via multiple different mechanism . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) may suitable . Ischemic precondition phenomenon whereby brief period non-lethal ischemia tissue render resistant effect subsequent much longer ischaemic insult . It first describe canine heart [ 4 ] . Subsequent clinical trial show ischemic preconditioning reduce heart muscle damage follow coronary artery bypass graft [ 5 ] liver dysfunction follow hepatic resection [ 6 ] . Following cardiac surgery , associate reduction critical care stay , arrhythmia inotrope use [ 7 ] . However , ischemic preconditioning require direct interference target tissue ' blood supply , limit clinical utility . Further experimental work suggest brief ischemia one tissue , kidney , could confer protection distant organ heart [ 8 ] . A similar effect observe transient skeletal muscle ischemia [ 9-11 ] . This effect refer 'preconditioning distance ' 'remote ischemic preconditioning ' ( RIPC ) .</detailed_description>
