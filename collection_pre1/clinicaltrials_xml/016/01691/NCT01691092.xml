	<brief_summary>This study design look involvement process brain call glutamate system depression . Participants undergo screen session , two fMRI scan , three PET scan , well cognitive test scan session . For one PET scan , drug ( either ketamine n-acetyl cysteine ) administer . Hypothesis 1 : The investigator hypothesize administration ketamine n-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) lead decrease mGluR5 . Hypothesis 2 : The investigator hypothesize improvement memory attentional skill drug challenge . Hypothesis 3 : The investigator hypothesize increase mGluR5 availability change MRI measure post drug challenge compare baseline , signify synaptogenesis . Hypothesis 4 : We expect significant difference reduction mGluR5 availability due difference ABP688 radiotracer infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To determine acute effect medication-induced glutamate release mGluR5 availability human subject . Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize administration ketamine n-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) lead decrease mGluR5 availability . Aim 2 : To determine glutamate release via administration ketamine NAC pro cognitive benefit . Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize improvement memory attentional skill drug challenge . Aim 3 : To determine synaptogenesis detectable PET MRI post ketamine NAC within week drug challenge ( time great antidepressant response ) . Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesize increase mGluR5 availability change MRI measure , post drug challenge compare baseline , signify synaptogenesis . Aim 4 : To determine difference reduction mGluR5 availability ketamine administration radiotracer administer bolus compare bolus constant infusion subject ( ABP688 radiotracer ) . Hypothesis 4 : We expect significant difference reduction mGluR5 availability due difference ABP688 radiotracer infusion .</detailed_description>
