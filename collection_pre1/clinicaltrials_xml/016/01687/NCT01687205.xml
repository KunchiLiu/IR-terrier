	<brief_summary>Study Objectives : - To assess impact coitus ( semen ) pharmacokinetics tenofovir 1 % gel female genital tract secretion , vaginal cervical tissue rectal tract secretion - To assess impact coitus ( semen ) pharmacodynamics luminal drug measure anti-HIV-1 activity CVL sample Study Summary : MTN-011 enroll heterosexual monogamous , sexually active couple , partner healthy HIV-negative . The female participant must age 21-46 ( inclusive ) currently use effective non-barrier contraception . Male participant must 21 year age old . This Phase 1 expand safety study assess tenofovir PK genital tract secretion ( CVL ) , rectal ( rectal sponge ) intracellular extracellular tissue compartment ( vaginal biopsy ) absence , follow coitus . Pharmacodynamics ( antiviral activity ) also assess CVL . MTN-011 study time coitus might greatest impact variable , gel apply shortly prior coitus absence drug reservoir . MTN-011 examine PK/PD response single dose 1 % tenofovir gel apply shortly sex compare PK/PD assessments follow single gel application without sex . Additionally , data obtain visit participant dose gel sex serve additional control pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study antiviral activity CVL . If tenofovir retain antiviral activity follow sex , anti-HIV activity CVL collect visit female participant dose gel sex comparable CVL collect visit female dose gel engage intercourse significantly great endogenous anti-HIV activity CVL obtain visit participant dose gel sex visit gel administer sex occur . Data analysis perform completion enrollment follow-up procedure demonstrate impact coitus semen PK/PD single 1 % tenofovir dose apply shortly prior sex .</brief_summary>
