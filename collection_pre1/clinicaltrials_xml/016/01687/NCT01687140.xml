	<brief_summary>Pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) relatively common often severe condition become chronic untreated . One effective treatment OCD type cognitive behavioral therapy call exposure response prevention ( ERP ) . ERP involve present patient fear object situation ( content obsessional fear ) gradual manner help use cop technique refrain engaging ritual ( compulsion ) . Despite several study suggest ERP effective treatment pediatric OCD , many youngster fail respond treatment , respond partially . An exciting recent find animal research ability establish antibiotic ( traditionally use treat Tuberculosis ) , D-cycloserine ( trade name : Seromycin ) enhance certain type learn among rat . The type learning enhance call extinction learn many researcher believe extinction learn equivalent process occur ERP ; process whereby repeat exposure object fear without bad outcome cause object cease associate danger . Several clinical trial use ERP form exposure treatment adult anxiety disorder reproduce find animal literature ; pair DCS exposure treatment ( comparable extinction learn ) result great fear reduction DCS administer . The effect DCS exposure treatment anxiety disorder among child test preliminarily one study child OCD result unclear child receive DCS augmentation show non-significant increased level improvement compare child receive DCS augmentation . In study , 26 youngster age 7-17 primary diagnosis OCD recruit assigned random one two treatment condition . Youth DCS condition study receive 50 mg DCS 1 hr prior treatment session , youth placebo condition receive identical placebo capsule 1 hr prior treatment augmentation session . All participant receive 180 minute CBT OCD 4 day per week 2 week study participation ( included IOP already ) . All family complete thorough evaluation 5 day prior receive DCS 9th treatment visit IOP ( third week ) , mid-treatment augmentation ( 12th IOP treatment session ) , post-treatment augmentation ( 16th IOP treatment session ) , 3-month follow-up ( 12 week 16th IOP treatment session ) . The primary aim study obtain preliminary data compare effect acute administration DCS versus placebo symptom response exposure treatment pediatric OCD . Results study help inform refine future study , eventually , impact treatment pediatric OCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use D-Cycloserine Augment CBT Pediatric OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although research demonstrate clear benefit cognitive behavioral treatment child obsessive-compulsive disorder , typical rate treatment response far absolute even treatment responder tend exhibit continue symptom . In one cite large child OCD treatment study date , 39 % participant show robust response 12-week course CBT . In recent year , basic research find D-Cyclocerine , partial N-methyl-Daspartate ( NMDA ) receptor agonist , enhance extinction learn fear among rats2 generate significant interest among clinical researcher . This surprising give core component CBT involve expose individual fear stimuli absence fear consequence ( ie , extinction training ) . Indeed , data several trial ( adult social anxiety , specific phobia , OCD ) indicate compare placebo , DCS add exposure , participant tend respond faster high rate treatment . This significant development clinical treatment anxiety disorder examine one pilot study among child OCD . In study , effect DCS modest methodology utilized ( eg. , objective symptom measure , lack information regard aspect treatment ) make result difficult interpret . The present study help clarify , albeit preliminary way , whether DCS promise addition treatment option available OCD treatment provider . The great utility augmentation strategy may capability hasten rate improvement , thus , decrease discomfort treatment decrease treatment drop-out . *Research Design Methods : Describe detail design methodology study . A ) Overview We propose examine preliminary efficacy D-cycloserine augmentation eight session ( two week ) intensive exposure response prevention treatment administer youngster age 7-17 primary OCD . All subject receive clinical treatment UCLA Child OCD Intensive Outpatient Program DCS introduce , deliver third fourth week ( start 9th IOP treatment visit ) subject 's participation IOP clinical treatment . To best address aim , total twenty-six 7-17 year-old child adolescent recruit UCLA Child OCD Intensive Outpatient Program . After complete eligibility screen , qualify participant undergo baseline evaluation include diagnostic well symptom assessment randomization treatment . This baseline assessment complete 5 day prior 9th treatment visit ( i.e. , first day DCS medication ) . Following assessment , subject randomize receive either DCS placebo ( PBO ) 4 time weekly immediately precede treatment session two week treatment ( 4 session weekly ) . Study participant receive cognitive-behavior treatment IOP whether active ( DCS ) placebo ( PBO ) condition . In addition , subject continue clinical treatment IOP long clinically indicate . However , responder study week 2 ( CGI-I = 1 2 ) reassess three-month follow-up establish durability early response . Parents participate child 's clinical assessment , fill self-reports , good help research team understand child 's functioning . Please see attach table procedure overview . B . Core Clinical Assessment ( Visit 1 ) : Diagnostic assessment base Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule DSM-IV , Child Version Parent Version ( ADIS-C &amp; ADIS-P ; Silverman &amp; Albano , 1996 ) . The ADIS structure interview schedule design obtain information symptomatology , course , etiology , severity anxiety disorder , mood disorder , externalize disorder child adolescent . The following section administer visit : anxiety disorder ( except selective mutism ) , anxiety disorder NOS , MDD , dysthmia , bipolar , ADHD , CD , ODD , substance use disorder , tic disorder . The ADIS currently provide basis psychiatric diagnosis ongoing CAMELS Study Child OCD , Anxiety , &amp; TS program collaborating center . All potential research subject undergo ADIS assessment one train study clinical interviewer . The ADIS interview take approximately 90 minute complete administer baseline . All study subject complete core battery dimensional psychiatric rating scale fully characterize OCD along key variable , include demographic status , comorbid symptomatology , functional status , adverse event side effect . Many measure derive recent ongoing treatment protocol OCD , Anxiety Tic Disorders Program . In addition ADIS , core battery include follow measure : 1 . Demographics/History . Provides standardized information regard demographic status , medical history , past history mental health treatment . ( 10 minute , baseline ) 2 . Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) : semi-structured clinical rating scale assess OCD severity . The CY-BOCS develop Yale University definition OCD symptoms severity child . The CY-BOCS administered youngster either parent- child-report obsession compulsion ADIS interview . ( 30 minute baseline administration ; 15 minute end study week 1 , week 2 , week 4 , week 6 , week 10 , 3-month follow-up ) 3 . Child OCD Impact Scale Child OCD Impact Scale ( COIS ; Piacentini et al. , 2003 ) reliable valid self-report measure OCD-related functional impairment . ( 5-10 minute baseline , end study week 1 , week 2 , 3-month follow-up ) . 4 . Children 's Depression Inventory - ( Kovacs , 1992 ) . The CDI psychometrically sound rating scale comprise 27 item ( rat 0-2 ) assess depressive symptomatology precede 2 week . Age gender-based T-scores generate five factor depression . ( 10 minute baseline , end study week 2 , 3-month follow-up ) . 5 . Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGI-S ) : A clinician rat instrument design measure overall illness severity specific time point . This measure record time point clinician rat affect subject burden . 6 . Clinical Global Impression Improvement ( CGI-I ) : A clinician rat instrument design measure overall symptom improvement specific time point relative baseline symptom severity . This measure record time point clinician rat affect subject burden . 7 . Side Effects Adverse Events : Side effect adverse event assess every visit use use amended Adverse Event Form another study group involve . ( 5 minute ) . 8 . Behavioral Approach Test ( BAT ) : We adapt BATs study Ollendick et ( 2011 ) develop BATs specifically child . When possible , BATs realistic child ask approach and/or touch actual fear object situation . When possible , child picture video use . BAT assessment design idiographically participant base upon response clinician administer CYBOCS instrument . The task administer baseline ( study week 0 ) , end study week 1 , end treatment ( end study week 2 ) . The BATs consist series gradually difficult step ( range 7 12 step depend specific phobia ) . Due variability number step BATs , percentage step complete used primary behavioral measure BAT performance . For BAT , child instruct best , also inform terminate BAT time wish . BATs terminate child 's request terminal step achieve . Children ask provide rating anxiety utilize SUDS range 0 8 ( 0 = None , 2 = A Little , 4 = Some , 6 = A Lot , 8 = Very Much ) . Ratings obtain immediately follow last step BAT . ( 15-20 minute baseline , end study week 1 , end study week 2 , 3-month follow-up ) . Staff train supervision project-specific clinical measure coordinate supervised senior research study personnel use standardized method maintain reliability time . This portion assessment estimate take approximately 1.5 hour 2 hour . F. Procedure : Following assessment , total 26 eligible subject UCLA IOP randomize computer-generated program UCLA research pharmacy double-blinded fashion receive either eight-sessions DCS augment exposure plus response prevention ( ERP +DCS ) treatment ( four time per week 2 week ) eight session placebo ERP ( ERP+PBO ) time period . All study staff family knowledge whether individual youngster receive placebo DCS . All subject clinically assess first second study week treatment 12 week later . Additionally , brief assessment ( CY-BOCS CGI measure ) end study week 4 , 6 , 10 . Parents also participate child 's clinical assessment , fill self-reports , good help research team understand child 's functioning .
