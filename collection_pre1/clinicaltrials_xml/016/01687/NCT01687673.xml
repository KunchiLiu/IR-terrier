	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial develop follow completion Phase I study combination temsirolimus sorafenib 25 first-line therapy patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( December 2009 April 2012 ) . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination temsirolimus 10 mg IV weekly plus sorafenib 200 mg ( oral , twice daily ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Combination Temsirolimus Sorafenib Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis single-arm phase II study combination temsirolimus sorafenib achieve clinically-meaningful median time progression ( TTP ) least 6 month , null hypothesis less equal 3 month , first-line systemic therapy patient advance HCC . A randomized trial would require formally compare efficacy combination sorafenib alone indicated phase II study achieves median TTP least 6 month . An interim safety analysis employ stopping rule 30 % planned patient treat least one dose protocol therapy ensure combination confer excessive toxicity . A key aspect study requirement histologic confirmation along adequate archival tissue correlative tissue analysis explore new biomarkers response mTOR inhibition . Circulating biomarker data include enumeration circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) measurement tumor marker AFP perform specific timepoints evaluate predictive value . Specimen banking tissue , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell undertaken enable future novel biomarker study . Modified RECIST perform addition standard RECIST 1.1 explore improved image predictor response .</detailed_description>
