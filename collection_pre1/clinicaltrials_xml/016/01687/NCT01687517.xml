	<brief_summary>Sarcoidosis inflammatory disease unknown origin affect organ , especially lungs mediastinum . Some location sarcoidosis may require treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressors.Although seasonal influenza vaccination recommend sarcoidosis subgroup risk ( respiratory failure , pulmonary fibrosis , age 65 , use immunosuppressive therapy , etc ... ) , investigator presently data efficacy safety ( absence adverse reaction ) seasonal influenza vaccination sarcoidosis.Especially know whether seasonal influenza vaccine provide rate type vaccine response sarcoidosis patient general population . Similarly , unclear whether vaccine response modify severity disease treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressors.Based know systemic lupus rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory autoimmune disease , investigator expect best 50 % vaccine response patient sarcoidosis 85 % vaccination response healthy control . The demonstration vaccine response could allow reconsider new vaccine approach sarcoidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Influenza Vaccine During Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data vaccination sarcoidosis largely insufficient . It thus unclear whether vaccine response modify accord clinical phenotype disease and/or treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressant . However , sarcoidosis accompany numerous disturbance immune system , include tendency anergy may affect efficacy vaccine , especially disease active severe . In addition , tolerance influenza vaccination patient sarcoidosis study yet.The influenza vaccination sarcoidosis common practice among medical specialist care patient sarcoidosis , either internist lung specialists.. However , practice vaccination base scientific evidence , data establish efficacy safety influenza vaccination sarcoidosis.Thus , possible influenza vaccine less immunogenic patient sarcoidosis healthy adult , may reduce clinical effectiveness vaccination . It therefore seem essential determine efficacy safety vaccine , widely practice . Poor efficiency could lead development different vaccination strategy , base particular administration adjuvanted vaccine .</detailed_description>
