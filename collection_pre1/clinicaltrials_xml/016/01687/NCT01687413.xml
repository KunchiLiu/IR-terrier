	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study intensity adjuvant ( `` helper '' ) therapy require p16 positive oropharynx cancer patient , know disease remove surgically minimally invasive approach , extracapsular spread lymph node . Patients consent participate either randomize ( physician choose radiotherapy arm radiotherapy &amp; cisplatin arm ) non-randomized ( patient chooses radiotherapy arm radiotherapy &amp; cisplatin arm ) pathway . After surgery , receive either radiation alone , radiation weekly cis-platinum therapy . Patients follow cancer , functional quality life outcome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must histologically confirm p16 positive squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx ( OPSCC ) . Patient must undergo transoral resection T14a oropharynx primary negative margin , neck dissection ( ) . Patient 's disease must pathological Nstage positive . Patient 's disease must show extracapsular spread ( ECS ) nodal metastasis verify central pathologist 's review . Patients synchronous primary include . Patients unknown primary include diagnosis resection primary site oropharynx make endoscopic robotic surgical procedure ( ) . Patients recent excisional node biopsies/neck dissection include material evaluable extracapsular spread . Patient must ≥ 21 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Patient ( legally authorize representative ) must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Patient must pathologically N stage negative disease . Patient must outside nodal tissue previous neck biopsy/neck dissection ECS confirm deny . Patient must true unknown primary permanent section result negative malignancy completely excise ipsilateral oropharyngeal tissue ( palatine lingual tonsil ) . Patient must distant metastatic disease presentation . Patient must gross residual and/or microscopic disease present surgery include reresection ( ) , per operative pathology report . Patient must transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) T3 T4 primary tumor . Patient must history prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year ; noninvasive cancer ( example , carcinoma situ oral cavity , larynx , breast cervix permissible ) permit even diagnose treat &lt; 3 year ago . Patient must previous systemic chemotherapy study cancer . ( Note : prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable ) . Patient must receive investigational agent . Patient must prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field Patient must lifethreatening comorbid illness e.g . stroke major sequela myocardial infarction/ unstable angina within precede 3 month psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
