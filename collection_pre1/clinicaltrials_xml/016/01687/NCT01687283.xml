	<detailed_description>Male female subject 17 70 ( inclusive ) year age severe persistent asthma meeting inclusion criterion complete screening period 2 week , proportion 1:1 , randomly receive fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID treatment period 12 week . The clinic visit arrange 2 week , 4 week , 8 week 12 week study treatment . If subject meet criteria pre-defined asthma control treatment 4 week 8 week , one chance treat half dose study drug . 2 week completion study treatment early withdrawal study , follow-up visit perform assess post-treatment adverse event . The primary endpoint mean change baseline morning peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) 12 week treatment period . Safety assessment include adverse event , vital sign , oral oropharyngeal candidiasis , hematological , biochemical test ) , 24-hour urinary cortisol 12-lead ECG . The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics fluticasone propionate inhalation solution also assess .</detailed_description>
