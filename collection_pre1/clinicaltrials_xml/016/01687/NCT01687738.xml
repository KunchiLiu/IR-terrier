	<brief_summary>Purpose : Overall lung surgery rate black/white disparity improve decade documentation . The goal study incorporate lesson previous prospective cohort study optimize lung cancer surgery rate narrow black-white disparity patient diagnosed stage I II , non-small cell lung cancer . Participants : Stage I II , non-small cell lung cancer 3 participate site . Procedures : Phase I study complete . Phase I deidentified 3-year , retrospective chart review , use establish baseline surgical rate intervention . The patient enrollment phase study move forward include use real time registry follow patient progression clinical follow , diagnostic test treatment biopsy proven highly probable early stage , non-small cell lung cancer . The patient enrollment portion study start , September 2012 . All patient Stage I II non-small cell lung cancer enroll study enter real time registry every site . Patients ' progress registry include follow-up provider visit , diagnostic test , procedure transparent miss appointment flag . Feedback give lung cancer provider arm . The randomized trial compare patient receive usual care plus registry receive registry plus visit call train cancer communicator -educator ( CCE ) well versed issue specific lung cancer train active listen communication account patient ' limitation health literacy . The CCE also use Kleinman 's Patient Model identify attitude beliefs represent barrier recommend care could potentially addressed negotiation target communication . The hypothesis electronic warning system , data transparency , enhance communication optimize lung surgery rate reduce racial gap .</brief_summary>
