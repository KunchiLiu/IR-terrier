	<detailed_description>The role lipid ( cholesterol triglyceride ) risk factor cardiovascular event well-documented . The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration find approximately log-linear adjusted association cholesterol concentration risk first-time non-fatal myocardial infarction ; coronary heart disease ( CHD ) death ; ischaemic , haemorrhagic unclassified stroke . They also find triglyceride concentration independently relate CHD risk control HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , non-HDL-C , standard risk factor . The Prospective Studies Collaboration find Higher HDL-C low non-HDL-C level approximately independently associate low ischaemic heart disease mortality . By focus broad outcome large meta-analyses conflate association development different cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) phenotypes , disease progression mortality cardiovascular cause . With link electronic health record , potential cohort sufficient size clinical detail investigate association lipid concentration initial presentation range CVD phenotypes across cerebral , coronary , abdominal peripheral arterial circulation .</detailed_description>
