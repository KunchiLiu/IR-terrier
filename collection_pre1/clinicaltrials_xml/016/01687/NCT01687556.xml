	<brief_title>EGCG Improves Acne Modulating Molecular Targets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris one prevalent skin disorder sebaceous follicle , affect 85 % adolescent United States . Acne persist throughout adulthood , even mild form acne might progress permanent scar face , chest back , thereby cause significant physical psychosocial morbidity . Acne multifactorial disease etiology fully elucidate , although considerable progress make understand pathogenesis last decade . The major pathogenic feature acne include abnormal ductal keratinization , sebum overproduction , Propionibacterium acnes , inflammation . Common acne medication topical retinoids , antibiotic isotretinoin associate irritation incomplete response , increase bacterial resistance untoward side event , respectively . Thus continue need novel , effective agent target different aspect acne pathogenesis , minimal side effect . In recent decade , epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , major polyphenolic constituent green tea , attract much interest account potent anti-carcinogenic , anti-inflammatory , anti-proliferative , antimicrobial activity . Preclinical , observational , clinical trial data indicate EGCG inhibit tumor initiation , promotion , progression , angiogenesis . EGCG also suppress neutrophil chemotaxis , suggest improve many disease inflammatory component diabetes , kidney injury , arthritis , allergy , dental caries , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , neurodegenerative disease . In skin , EGCG investigate mainly light antioxidative , immunopotentiating anticarcinogenic property chemical ultraviolet irradiation . Moreover , EGCG lipid-lowering antiandrogenic property , downregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ expression . Based observation , infer EGCG might effective treatment acne .</detailed_description>
