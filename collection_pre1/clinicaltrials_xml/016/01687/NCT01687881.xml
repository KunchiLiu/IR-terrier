	<brief_summary>This study highlight validate chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy ( CSMT ) cervicogenic headache ( CEH ) . If method prof effective , provide new non-pharmacological treatment option CEH . This especially important since pharmacological management minor effect CEH , alternative treatment option warrant . The applied methodology study aim towards high possible research standard . This international study collaboration Akershus University Hospital , Innlandet Hospital University Oslo ( UiO ) , Norway Macquarie University , Australia . The multidisciplinary professional background physiotherapy , chiropractic medicine . By increase methodological quality investigator research high level , investigator see method work guide increase quality chiropractic research future , previous randomize clinical trial ( RCTs ) CEH use methodology show room improvement . Study hypothesis : CSMT use Gonstead method reduces day CEH least 25 % compare placebo ( sham manipulation , i.e . broad non-specific contact , non-directional , low velocity low amplitude ) intervention ( control group ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervicogenic headache ( CEH ) symptomatic headache characterize chronic unilateral headache symptom sign neck involvement . CEH often worsen neck movement , sustain awkward head position , external pressure upper cervical occipital region symptomatic side . Abolition headache follow diagnostic anesthetic block cervical structure local factor neck give evidence pain attribute neck disorder lesion . The prevalence CEH 0.2 % general population Akershus County , i.e . 9,000 Norwegians CEH . However , prevalence varies 0.4-4.1 % study apply less rigorous diagnostic criterion . The efficacy pharmacological management CEH poor . Patients suffer CEH commonly treat CSMT , methodology one shortcoming study . In addition , RCTs mostly include participant infrequent CEH follow recommend clinical guideline International Headache Society ( IHS ) intervention least three month . An analysis literature well recent pilot study suggest CSMT effect headache intensity duration , medication intake . However , randomize control clinical trial high methodological quality CEH still remain conducted . The RCT single blind , placebo-controlled trial CSMT use Gonstead method vs. sham manipulation control group . If treatment show effective , participant receive sham manipulation control offer true intervention follow-up period free charge . This study follow recommendation set clinical trial guideline IHS , methodological quality control general follow previous suggest criterion CONSORT statement . Patients recruit Akershus University Hospital Innlandet Hospital , Norway well medium advertise Akershus Oslo County . The diagnose set chiropractor neurologist experience headache . The clinical trial consist three stage : Run-in , intervention ( treatment ) follow-up . One month base line data collection participant fill-in diagnostic headache diary . Baseline demographic clinical characteristic present table mean standard deviation ( SD ) group . The participant randomize draw prepared sealed lot . Each lot include three different intervention , i.e active treatment , sham manipulation control group . The first three participant draw lot three intervention use . The next lot three intervention follow next three participant . The RCTs conduct experienced chiropractor . Active treatment consist CSMT use Gonstead method . A specific contact , high velocity , low amplitude , short lever , recoil post adjustment direct spinal biomechanical dysfunction diagnose standard chiropractic test . Follow-up 3 , 6 12 month post-treatment . During period participant continue fill diagnostic headache diary . The control group also include phase study . The data analyze SPSS use standard statistical technique . The investigator base calculation sample size migraine day recent group comparison study topiramate ( 38 ) . The investigator calculate sample size 16 patient require detect difference mean reduction monthly headache day 2.5 80 % power , p=0.05 level significance , assume common SD 2.5 active treatment broad-based treatment group .
