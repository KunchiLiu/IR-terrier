	<brief_summary>Agents inhibit cholesterol synthesis investigate cancer dependent upon cholesterogenesis . Red yeast rice ( RYR ) , reddish-purple fermented rice , contain statin know inhibit cholesterol synthesis . Laboratory study also show RYR direct effect androgen dependent androgen independent prostate cancer cell , inhibit growth . It think RYR may clinical benefit subject localize prostate cancer choose manage active surveillance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Red Yeast Rice Subjects With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Red yeast rice promote safe effective alternative statin therapy treatment hypercholesterolemia . Red yeast rice potential slow prostate cancer growth inhibit cholesterol androgen biosynthesis . There strong rationale use RYR patient manage active surveillance localize , low risk , prostate cancer . To date , human study utilize RYR setting report .</detailed_description>
