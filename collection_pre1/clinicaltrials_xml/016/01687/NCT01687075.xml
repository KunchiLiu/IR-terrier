	<detailed_description>The development , clinical validation , widespread use drug-eluting stent revolutionize treatment patient coronary artery disease . Large scale , prospective , multicenter double-blind randomized trial provide strong evidence sirolimus-eluting stent , paclitaxel-eluting stent , zotarolimus-eluting stent significantly reduce angiographic restenosis enhance event-free survival compare bare-metal stent implantation native coronary arteries1 . However , high rate late late stent thrombosis SES PES , likely due delay incomplete endothelialization compare BMS , raise safety concern DES class . Therefore , alongside clinical investigation , histopathological evaluation conduct coronary artery patient die DES implantation examine heal status vessel . The evidence obtain suggested polymer component use carry drug first generation DES may associate local inflammatory response , associate localized hypersensitivity eosinophil infiltration , consequent alteration vessel wall delay formation endothelium . Because specific stent design and/or polymer feature may impact DES performance , numerous study focus comparative assessment various DES , conflict result . The clinical need thus exist enhanced stent design offer improved safety efficacy profile compare earlier stent platform . new technology develop lead creation device delivery system base use biocompatible bioabsorbable polymer cytostatic drug similar sirolimus . The clinical data obtain second generation demonstrate , device test , less efficacy first-generation DES , good safety profile , although statistically significant.Concerning widely use second generation DES , small first-in-man trial , safety efficacy study large randomized trial patient non-complex lesion EES compare PES , prove angiographic superiority clinical non-inferiority . A step forward , assess clinically significant difference among different DES , do new randomize trial compare EES versus PES , power test superiority clinical outcome sufficient magnitude provide data patient subgroup , particularly patient diabetes . At present , third-generation DES , develop minimize possible side effect relate presence polymer , evaluate human . To avoid presence polymer surface device , different platform evaluate : porous surface onto pure drug place hole close towards intraluminal part bioabsorbable polymer , onto drug load . A third option avoid need polymer use new CRE8 DES , feature polymer free platform abluminal reservoir release Amphilimus formulation . This device test Taxus Liberté randomize clinical trial , assess non-inferiority angiographic efficacy result . The 6month angiographic analysis , demonstrate primary study endpoint achieve , show CRE8 inferior Taxus Liberté term efficacy performance .</detailed_description>
