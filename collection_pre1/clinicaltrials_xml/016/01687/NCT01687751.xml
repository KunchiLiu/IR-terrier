	<brief_summary>Cancer patient difficult control symptom Abbotsford ( AC ) Fraser Valley ( FVC ) Cancer Centers refer admitted Tertiary Palliative Care Units Abbotsford Regional Hospital Cancer Center ( ARHCC ) . For symptom management , patient sometimes give midazolam continuously needle place underneath skin . While effective symptom management , midazolam sedating , leave patient unable interact love one last day . This study pilot project . Before proceed full-scale study , `` pilot study '' `` feasibility study '' often carry first test design study , likelihood successful recruitment acceptability intervention potential subject . The basic idea find whether practical proceed large study include subject . This type study involve small number subject therefore result use guide large study . The investigator also determine whether palliative care cancer patient take medication call dexmedetomidine would improve rousability ( easily fully awaken ) symptom control ( pain , shortness breath , nausea confusion ) compare take standard care receive medication midazolam . The use dexmedetomidine clinical situation ( Operating Room Intensive Care Unit patient still respond doctor ) show effective symptom control provide good degree rousability patient well study palliative care environment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Comparing Treatment With Dexmedetomidine Midazolam Symptom Control Advanced Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Advanced cancer patient near end life suffer pain , anxiety symptom difficult control . The current practice within Fraser Health Authority admit patient one three tertiary palliative care unit ( TPCUs ) pain symptom management . Once admit , pain symptom relieving measure insufficient , patient give continuous subcutaneous infusion ( CSCI ) drug midazolam symptom management . While effective , sedation midazolam often leave patient unable eat drink interact environment . Dexmedetomidine unique promising agent manage intractable symptom palliative patient end life . In addition provide proportional sedation symptom control , compare midazolam , dexmedetomidine additional attribute provide improved management pain , dyspnea delirium . Of special interest patient would like continue involved decision make able communicate love one end life quality rousability possible dexmedetomidine use sedation instead midazolam . These feature well study ICU anaesthesia literature palliative care environment . PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION Currently , standard care patient difficult intractable symptom patient admit tertiary palliative care unit Fraser Health administration midazolam CSCI recommend evidence base Fraser Health Authority ( FHA ) Hospice Palliative Care Program Symptom Guideline `` Refractory Symptoms Palliative Sedation Therapy Guideline '' . The guideline state among criterion implementation palliative sedation therapy `` unusual circumstance , death anticipate within hour day '' . However , many patient difficult intractable symptom natural course illness longer 'hours day ' . These patient would benefit degree sedation proportional severity symptom . Therefore , particularly circumstance , option deep palliative sedation midazolam necessary patient would often like aware around still confuse pain . Despite many study among ICU anaesthesia patient , two report four patient evaluate use dexmedetomidine palliative care environment . The first case 45 year old man cervical paraganglioma , palliative performance scale ( PPS ) 10 % uncontrolled pain , insomnia , anxiety severe psychological distress . Combined morphine , continuous intravenous infusion ( CIVI ) dexmedetomidine provide relief pain anxiety within 30 minute . The patient sleep without sign pain , prompt communication sister possible . The infusion continue 24 hr good physical psychological symptom control . The second case 54 year old woman breast cancer , PPS 20 % , delirium hypercalcemia . Treatment also include CIVI morphine , haloperidol 10 mg/day . Dexmedetomidine CIVI 48 hr infusion improve agitation patient able transfer bed , sit chair communicate necessary . When intravenous access lose , patient sedate midazolam CSCI 5 mg/hr die 72 hour hour later . The third case 40 year old woman advance cervical cancer , PPS 10 % , renal failure , hypercalcemia , intractable agitated delirium pain movement . Treatment include CSCI morphine , hydration haloperidol 8 mg/day . Dexmedetomidine infusion temporarily improve delirium 5 hour , pain movement . When restlessness return , dexmedetomidine change midazolam 12 mg/hr 4 day patient die . The fourth case 46 year old woman intractable back leave abdominopelvic pain radiating leave leg . She diagnose adenocarcinoma unknown primary progressively expand leave retroperitoneal mass involve psoas muscle adjacent vertebral body . After titration phase dexmedetomidine , pain decrease 6/10 measured numerical pain scale consider tolerable patient . There significant sedation . By third day , pain increase 9/10 . As patient 's wish go home , instead titrate dexmedetomidine , continuous epidural start bupivicaine clonidine . Current ongoing study dexmedetomidine use palliative care environment limit Phase II study dexmedetomidine treat symptom distress advance cancer patient . The objective nine patient cohort study Duke University Medical Center ass effectiveness 3 separate dos dexmedetomidine ( 0.7 , 1.5 , 2.5 mg/kg/hr continuous intravenous infusion ) add-on treatment intractable pain , agitation delirium terminally ill cancer patient last week life death . Overall , limit evidence literature guide practice use dexmedetomidine palliative care environment . Given gap knowledge , investigator propose conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) dexmedetomidine CSCI compare midazolam CSCI advance cancer patient palliative care set . The subcutaneous route chosen pilot study prefer route drug delivery conforms current standard care accord FHA Hospice Palliative Care symptom guideline `` Refractory Symptoms Palliative Sedation Therapy Guideline '' : `` Where feasible , use midazolam CSCI prefer permit responsive titration . In general , subcutaneous administration prefer intravenous administration practical advantage subcutaneous infusion great risk apnea bolus injection administer intravenously '' . `` The subcutaneous route commonly use parenteral route palliative care '' , `` Drugs give via subcutaneous route tend high bioavailability ( generally near 100 % ) '' `` Subcutaneous infusion provide blood level comparable intravenous administration '' , `` Perfusion subcutaneous tissue similar muscle , rate absorption slower . '' Dexmedetomidine successfully administer CSCI pediatric population , far used CSCI palliative care patient . Neither midazolam dexmedetomidine currently approve use subcutaneous route , Health Canada approval obtain subcutaneous ( SC ) route dexmedetomidine midazolam start study provide use prefer subcutaneous route ( intravenous ) palliative care environment . The goal trial ass feasibility methodological issue enrol subject large , multi-centre RCT ass effectiveness dexmedetomidine control pain , dyspnea , nausea and/or delirium compare midazolam . Altogether , finding research program ( pilot RCT multi-centre RCT ) provide critical information clinician health policy maker use dexmedetomidine patient advance cancer difficult control intractable symptom . RESEARCH QUESTION : The overall goal investigator answer follow question : Does dexmedetomidine enhance control pain , dyspnea , nausea and/or delirium , improve rousability , compare midazolam patient advance cancer ? However , purpose pilot study , investigator address follow question : What feasibility multicentre RCT compare dexmedetomidine midazolam enhance control pain , dyspnea , nausea and/or delirium advance cancer patient ? RESEARCH OBJECTIVE ( S ) : The objective pilot study : - To identify facilitator barrier recruit consent palliative care advance cancer patient - To assess site irritation administer dexmedetomidine continuous subcutaneous infusion alternate route continuous intravenous infusion advance cancer patient - To assess feasibility collect study measure - To assess utility new study measurement acceptable improvement symptom assess patient , family , staff Other objective interest : - To compare arousability palliative care advance cancer patient symptom control dexmedetomidine compare midazolam - To compare pain , dyspnea , nausea , delirium symptom palliative care advance cancer patient sedate dexmedetomidine compare midazolam</detailed_description>
