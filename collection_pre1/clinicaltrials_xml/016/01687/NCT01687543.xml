	<detailed_description>Infections Clostridium difficile consider frequent health care associate bacterial infection . Almost case connect use antibiotic . The spectrum symptom infection reach loose stool sepsis death . It estimate 5 % population carrier without symptom . Elderly people likely diagnose C. difficile infection 50 % ICU admission ( least Sweden ) patient age 64 year old C. difficile also ICU issue . Probiotic bacteria give antibiotic treat patient result fever case infection C. difficile others show small study . Due low statistical power former study multicentre study calculate large enough fulfil statistical requirement . Adult patient expect length stay intensive care three day include . Primary objective find emerge case colonisation C. difficile consequent symptom infection diarrhoea . Cultures toxin analysis take inclusion every second day till day 13 every third fourth day depend length ICU stay . Positive case give antibiotic accord normal routine . No culture collect per protocol culture record result analyse order find connection treatment reduction secondary infection . In early small study find improve normalised gut barrier function patient give probiotic bacteria compare worsen , scatter pattern placebo group . This probably found inflammatory parameter improve probiotic group parameter remain elevated control patient . The go creatinine , urea lactate . This record parameters together blood gas analysis expand study . Antibiotics medication corticosteroid , proton pump inhibitor acid reduce preparation , All nutritive prescription ( enteral formula IV solution well medical preparation contain glucose fat ) record compare actually give nutrient . Bowel movement frequency consistency record compare group .</detailed_description>
