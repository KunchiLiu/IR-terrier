	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( also know TB ) common infection major cause death child . Effective treatment use combination anti-tuberculosis ( anti-TB ) medication save life , dosage medication well establish child . Several research study show recommended dosage anti-TB medication child lead adequate blood level kill bacteria child . This situation may lead treatment failure emergence drug resistance . As result , world Health Organization ( WHO ) recently recommend increased dosage TB medication child . This study conduct find increased dosage anti-TB drug safe lead adequate drug level blood child TB without HIV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment guideline childhood TB largely inferred study adult , control trial do child establish optimum regimen . The standard anti-TB treatment consist combination isoniazid , rifampin , pyrazinamide ethambutol two month induction phase follow 2 month isoniazid rifampin continuation phase . The plasma tissue concentration drug combination regimen need optimize maximize bacterial kill reduce risk treatment failure emergence drug resistance . Several study show peak concentration drug large proportion child low concern ineffective therapy child . This concern lead recent recommendation WHO increase dosages first-line anti-TB drug child . To knowledge , safety pharmacokinetics new dosage study child West Africa . In addition , difference drug absorption , metabolism excretion may put child risk low drug concentration standard weight-based fixed-dosages prescribed child . Identification individual clinically genetic testing may important individualized dosing . The factor may influence drug concentration treatment effect include age , HIV coinfection status , nutritional status genetic polymorphism drug metabolize enzyme transporter . Younger child appear eliminate drug faster low plasma peak concentration compare old child adult treat similar mg/kg dos . The association nutritional status plasma pharmacokinetics anti-TB drug less clear , study report significant relationship . HIV coinfection important factor associate poor treatment response result poor drug absorption . The primary objective study evaluate pharmacokinetics tolerability elevate dosages first-line anti-TB child , well factor associate inter-individual variability anti-TB drug exposure Ghanaian child . A two-arm pharmacokinetic study child active TB without HIV coinfection perform Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital , Kumasi , Ghana . Children age 3 month 14 year , inform consent parent guardian obtain , enrol . A complete medical history , physical examination , nutritional status assessment perform enrolment subsequent study visit . Relevant data collect use standardized form . Baseline measurement prior initiation anti-TB treatment include complete blood count ( CBC ) , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , liver function test ( LFTs ) , well CD4 cell count determination plasma HIV-1 RNA level ( HIV co-infected ) . Measurements LFTs repeat week 2 therapy clinically indicated evaluate drug toxicity . All study participant follow-up 2 4 week monthly assess adverse event clinical response therapy . Anti-TB treatment initiate immediately upon TB diagnosis concurrent initiation ART allow co-infected child per national WHO guideline . The standard anti-TB regimen consist daily ingestion isoniazid , rifampin , pyrazinamide ethambutol 2 month , rifampin isoniazid daily 4 month . The new WHO recommend dos child prescribe . Weight-based fixed-dose combination tablet use . Children receive directly observe therapy anti-TB treatment healthcare worker hospital family member home . Treatment outcome ( completed/cured , die , default , discontinue , transfer ) define accord WHO criterion . Pharmacokinetic sampling perform 4 week anti-TB therapy . Study drug administer least 2-hour fast non-breastfed child blood sample obtain intravascular catheter time 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8-hours post dosing . Actual time dose sample accurately record . Doses vomit &lt; 30 minute dose require cancellation PK test reschedule . The sample place immediately ice centrifuge within 30 minute 3000g 10 minute 4oC . Plasma store - 70oC measurement drug concentration . Drug concentration determine use validate gas chromatography mass spectrometry .</detailed_description>
