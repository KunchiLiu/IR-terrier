	<brief_summary>Anemia one common health problem world around half preschool-aged child ( &lt; 5 year ) one third woman affect . Nutritional iron deficiency major reason anemia infant , young child woman reproductive age especially high iron requirement difficult meet region major diet base plant food . So Ethiopia , injera major staple food . Despite high level iron tef , favor cereal injera , iron bioavailability assume low due high level phytic acid find tef . The aim study determine iron bioavailability woman injera prepare traditional way investigate potential method improve bioavaiability . Therefore , 50/50 25/75 blend FeSO4 NaFeEDTA iron fortification evaluate . Further potential positive impact phytic acid reduction iron bioavailability investigate . The phytic acid reduction achieve two different way , addition whole grain wheat source phytase addition commercially available microbial phytase . The study conduct healthy woman use stable isotope technique .</brief_summary>
