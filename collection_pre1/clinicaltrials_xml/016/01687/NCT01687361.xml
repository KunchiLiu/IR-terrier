	<brief_summary>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) commonly use rehabilitation context order increase restore muscle capacity hypoactive patient patient articular trauma . Although technique seem particularly adapt muscle rehabilitation , grow evidence emerge regard potential damaging effect electrically- induced isometric contraction healthy human . Recent study report 10 30-fold increase creatine kinase ( CK ) activity couple significantly increase muscle soreness impair force production result NMESs . On basis , study conduct deleterious effect might limit clinical application NMES . Over last decade , many study pay attention branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) supplementation potential prophylactic/therapeutic approach . The rationale approach BCAA might increase protein synthesis reduce protein breakdown physiological mechanism involve mTOR regulation pathway ( mammalian Target Rapamycin ) . Additionally , BCAA could also use energetic substrate exercise glycogen store deplete . Overall , previous result support efficacy BCAA supplementation attenuate muscle damage . Nevertheless , comprehensive study investigate effect amino acid supplementation marker muscle damage still scarce . Magnetic resonance imaging ( IRM ) phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) powerful non invasive tool allow exploration skeletal muscle structure energy metabolism . This ambitious project devote anatomical , functional metabolic characterization BCAA supplementation NMES use MRI 31P-MRS . Various marker muscle damage , include maximal voluntary force production , T2 value apparent diffusion coefficient ( obtain MRI ) energy metabolism assess rest exercise ( use 31P-MRS ) , obtain NMES . This project utmost importance improve knowledge anatomic , metabolic functional event related BCAA supplementation context exercise-induced muscle damage</brief_summary>
