	<brief_summary>RESOLVE 's objective identify characterize validate molecular target capable shift primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound heal . Work package 2 ( WP2 ) RESOLVE include clinical study protocol within RESOLVE system evaluate different form pulmonary repair human range normal repair mainly inflammatory predominantly fibroproliferative repair . Hypothesis Fibrosis lung aberrant intensify form wound healing . It result unresolved disturbance initiation control repair partly age-related . As result relentlessly activate wound heal reaction , mechanisms inflammation largely represent condition chronic inflammation within peripheral bronchial tree aggravate abnormal form repair . A systematic comparison molecular pathology fibrotic repair represent - Varying intensity fibrosis relate pathology usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) , - Varying inflammatory mechanism ( UIP vs. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis [ HP ] , acute chronic ) , - Varying stage age ( Normal pulmonary repair young old individual vs. acute/chronic HP vs. UIP ) able - identify molecule capable shift regular repair towards fibroproliferative repair - elucidate interrelationship molecule form coordinate yet misdirect metabolic response characteristic fibroproliferative repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background After reach adulthood , organs human body preserve shape function long period , make direct repair one important mechanism throughout lifetime . Regular wound heal injury consist well-ordered sequence overlap phase : inflammation , formation supportive new tissue , re-epithelization final regeneration epithelial endothelial lining cell , essentially repeat complex process organ development . In young adult , damage organ frequently answer fully regenerative wound heal repeat mechanism embryonic organ growth call `` primary '' wound healing . Repeated damage young individual may cause `` secondary '' wound heal form scar formation serve rescue program maintain surface integrity epithelial and/or endothelial reorganization fail . Organ failure age organism , however , different essentially represent loss capacity achieve orderly reactivation organ development . This different quality wound heal consists combination chronic inflammation fibroproliferative , non-regenerative repair . Its pathology refers large group diseases involve every organ human body . In lung , prominent form characterize well-defined histopathology name usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) . Unfortunately , histopathology , identify particularly aggressive phenotype fibroproliferative repair response , allow unambiguous clinical diagnosis , UIP `` pattern '' may find different fibrotic disease lung , hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( HP ) , especially chronic form . In addition , various mechanism inflammation partly relate wound heal response , may profoundly intensify aberrant wound heal response . As result , mechanism lead condition maintain characteristic clinical appearance unknown . The current investigation belongs work package 2 RESOLVE study system ( FP7-HEALTH-F4-2008 Contract . 202047 ) contain clinical study protocol evaluate different form fibrotic repair human lung . RESOLVE 's main objective identify characterize clinically validated molecular target capable shift primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound heal . In pilot study , different form repair lung prospectively analyze mean concomitant clinical biological analysis guide evaluated functional radiological measure clinical development . The assessment make begin study period ( visit 1 ) , three month prospective observation ( visit 2 ) , 12 month ( end study ) allow clinically relevant correlation biological data obtain . Three general condition repair choose systematic biological analysis result clinical diagnosis ( histopathology , radiology ) association age : - Usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) occur almost exclusively age 55-80 year , - Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ( HP ) , acute chronic , occur age 20-55 year , - Normal repair young ( 18-40 year ) old ( old 55 year ) individual . Methods After secure diagnosis ( see : inclusion/exclusion criterion ) follow informed consent screen visit , patient lack previous immunosuppressive treatment ( therapy-naïve patient ) receive immunosuppressive therapy prednisolone ( daily dose 1 mg/kg BW ) least three month order exclude pathology dominate mechanisms inflammation . During screen visit , result histopathological analysis secure , clinical functional history disease record . This include previous medication , result previous pulmonary function test ( PFT ) well result radiological analysis ( compute tomography include HR-CT ) lab test ( exclude collagen vascular disease secure HP serology ) . Three month screen visit , visit 1 , functional radiological stage pulmonary fibrosis assess , patient finally enrol study . In accordance finding obtain screen visit , due functional radiological result obtain visit 1 , patient stratify follow investigational group : Group A : ( Limited UIP ) Patients proven UIP functionally radiologically less advanced pulmonary fibrosis ( n=12 ) define histopathology ( assessment two independent experienced pathologist involve study ) and/or radiology ( compute tomography [ CT ] scan incl . high-resolution CT , independently assess experienced radiologist involve study ) pulmonary function test ( PFT ) . PFT consist spirometry , measurement bodyplethysmograph , single-breath measurement carbon monoxide diffusion capacity full cardiopulmonary exercise test include assessment pulmonary ventilation gas exchange rest exertion ; Group B : ( Advanced UIP ) Patients proven UIP ( n=12 ) significantly advanced stage disease determine PFT ( FVC least 10 percent DLCO least 15 percent low group A ) CT scan ; Group C : ( Chronic fibrosing Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis , HP ) Patients chronic fibrosing HP ( n=12 ) diagnose histopathology , radiology lab test ; Group D : ( Acute HP ) Patients acute HP ( n=9 ) diagnose histopathology , radiology lab test ( Group D : acute HP ) ; Group E : Regular Pulmonary Repair 9 young ( 18-40 year age ) without clinically evident pathology 9 old volunteer ( 55-80 year age ) without pulmonary fibrosis serve control . All patient UIP HP follow study period 12 month . The study period start visit 1 . In addition visit 1 , two additional visit perform 3 month ( visit 2 , functional assessment ) 12 month ( visit 3 , end study ) .
