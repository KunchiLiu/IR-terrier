	<brief_summary>In transplant community , debate regard appropriate food service stem cell transplant patient . Recommendations regard use low bacterial diet base theoretical concept reduce risk contract infection pathogen find food source rather clinical trial . The evidence use neutropenic diet weak . To date , little randomize controlled study address question whether neutropenic diet addition prophylactic antibiotic necessary infection prevention myeloablative stem cell transplant patient . For reason , research aim provide data substantiate use neutropenic diet prevent infection recipient myeloablative stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infection Rates Myeloablative Allo SCT Recipients Receiving Neutropenic Diets Versus Non-Neutropenic Diets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose pilot study , randomize design use address primary secondary aim . Subjects randomize either experimental group receive non-neutropenic diet without restriction , control group receive standard neutropenic diet . While randomization occur prior , day inpatient admission subject begin study procedure upon admission Adult Stem Cell Transplant Inpatient Unit Duke University Medical Center . The diet continue 1 ) subject longer neutropenic , and/or 2 ) discharge inpatient unit continue care Adult Stem Cell Transplant Outpatient Clinic . By limit study time care inpatient unit , minimize opportunity deviation assign diet . Absence neutropenia define absolute neutrophil count great 500/uL ( manual differential ) total white blood cell count 1000/uL three consecutive day . All subject enrol follow standard prophylactic antibiotic regimen . Other supportive care also consistent two group .</detailed_description>
