	<brief_summary>Olfactory impairment common symptom neurologic disorder may relate dopaminergic dysfunction . Studies show patient migraine show increased sensitivity light sound . In previous study episodic migraineurs , olfaction similar age sex-matched control outside attack , low acute attack . The hypothesis olfactory function chronic migraine ( CM ) mild impairment olfaction baseline significant impairment migraine headache exacerbation . The investigator two objective : - To determine baseline olfactory acuity subject CM compare age sex-matched control - To determine olfaction change acute exacerbation migraine CM To execute study , investigator interview subject control ensure meet inclusion exclusion criterion . After obtain informed consent , subject control complete questionnaire survey regard history lack history headache , smell sensitivity , osmophobia current medication use answer question attack frequency , location headache , duration disease , use medication pain , disability . Both migraineurs control take University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test ( UPSIT ) office . After first visit , migraineurs control self-administer UPSIT home . They require return second test Jefferson Headache Center . The investigator use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) determine variance UPSIT score subject control . To achieve 90 % power study detect statistically significant difference mean UPSIT score two-sided 5 percent significance level , sample size subject control 50 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smell Sensitivity Chronic Migraine : A Case-Control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator interview subject control ensure meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . After obtain informed consent , subject control complete questionnaire survey interviewer regard history headache , smell sensitivity , osmophobia current medication use . Subjects also answer question attack frequency , location headache , duration disease , use medication pain , disability . After complete questionnaire survey , migraineurs control take University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test ( UPSIT ) office . During visit demonstrate give instruction perform UPSIT home . After first visit , migraineurs self-administer UPSIT migraine attack day home . They require mail drop second test Jefferson Headache Center . Age sex match control take first UPSIT office . They take second UPSIT 2 week later home call Headache Center notify staff complete second UPSIT . They ask mail drop test Jefferson Headache Center . The UPSIT standardize , validated test olfaction . There total 40 odorants , four booklet contain ten odorants . The stimulus embed `` scratch sniff '' microcapsules bottom page . Subjects must choose one answer among four possible answer odorant - forced choice test . The validity reliability UPSIT , well basis use particular odorants , demonstrate multiple study . The test kit supply Dr. Richard Doty University Pennsylvania . The investigator use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) determine variance UPSIT score subject control . We also use ANOVA examine difference base subject characteristic , include attack frequency , duration illness , osmophobia attack , odor trigger headache . The investigator also use Chi-square Wilcoxon rank sum test determine categorical outcome gender statistical significance group . To achieve 90 % power study detect statistically significant difference mean UPSIT score two-sided 5 percent significance level , sample size subject control 50 . This base assumption standard deviation response variable 3 unit . The investigator 's assumption effect size base previous study use UPSIT detect difference subject control neurologic disorder , schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
