	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness buffer local anesthesia injection numb gum teeth dental treatment . Adjusting pH lidocaine sodium bicarbonate may reduce pain injection adult child . In study , investigator compare two local anesthetic preparation , buffer anesthetic conventionally available anesthetic , pain upon injection . Hypothesis : Anesthetic buffer physiologic pH result less painful injection compare acidic alternative use dental office . This demonstrate compare two local anesthetic preparation , buffer anesthetic conventionally available anesthetic , pain upon injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Pain Conventional Buffered Local Anesthesia During Injection Pediatric Dental Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local anesthesia essential procedure comprehensive treatment pediatric patient . In treatment subject dental disease infection , local anesthesia commonly require perform operative procedure . The use local anesthesia serve two main purpose : ( ) enable patient remain free discomfort sometimes painful procedure ( ii ) permit practitioner complete procedure without fear hurt patient might otherwise impede practitioner 's ability provide comprehensive care . However , patient often fearful local anesthesia traditional preparation local anesthesia acidic painful . Thus , important advance area subject management pain control operative procedure would preparation local anesthesia significantly reduce pain upon injection . A 2010 Cochrane Review find adjust pH lidocaine sodium bicarbonate reduce pain injection adult child . In study , compare two local anesthetic preparation , buffer anesthetic conventionally available anesthetic , pain upon injection . The study test local anesthetic buffering system , Onset system , FDA Class 1 compound device manufacture Onpharma Inc . It simple portable local anesthesia buffer system compound anesthetic solution 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate neutralize additive solution precise manner bring anesthetic solution human physiologic pH . Commercially available local anesthetic low pH allow prolong shelf life , keep anesthetic molecule solution . The combination buffer sodium bicarbonate agent local anesthetic report result pain-free injection adult child . The neutralizing additive solution sterile , nonpyrogenic , solution sodium bicarbonate ( NaHCO3 ) water . pH adjust carbon dioxide . Sodium Bicarbonate Inj. , 8.4 % USP Neutralizing Additive Solution ( NDC Code 509-100-03 ) Lidocaine w/ Epinephrine compatible . Sodium bicarbonate use medicine dentistry regularly saline , pre-dates FDA . It commercially available currently use health professional U.S.A . The local anesthetic use study 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 ppm epinephrine , part amide family local anesthetic . It widely use dentistry medicine long-standing proven record safety .</detailed_description>
