	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 ) next-generation integrase inhibitor ( INI ) currently phase 3 clinical trial human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Fixed-dose combination ( FDCs ) greatly simplify treatment patient HIV . While Atripla ( FDC tenofovir ( TDF ) , emtricitabine ( FTC ) efavirenz ( EFV ) ) become preferred first line regimen due large part convenient presentation full treatment regimen single product , option need . A fixed-dose combination DTG/abacavir ( ABC ) /lamivudine ( 3TC ) one opportunity . Part A study single-dose , two-treatment crossover pivotal bioequivalence ( BE ) evaluation DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet 66 healthy subject . The reference formulation trial 50 mg DTG tablet currently use Phase 3 clinical trial already market FDC tablet product EPZICOM™ ( ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg ) .It intend result pivotal bioequivalence study show propose commercial DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet formulation bioequivalent DTG plus EPZICOM administer separate tablet . Part B study evaluate effect high fat meal FDC tablet 12 healthy subject already participate Part A study . There screen visit within 30 day prior first dose study drug follow visit within 7-14 day last dose . There 7 day washout dos treatment period . The following PK parameter DTG , ABC 3TC measure : area concentration curve time zero ( pre-dose ) extrapolate infinite time ( AUC ( 0-infinity ) ) , Area concentration-time curve time zero ( pre-dose ) time last quantifiable concentration ( AUC ( 0-t ) ) , maximum observed concentration ( Cmax ) , lag time observation drug concentration ( tlag ) , time occurrence Cmax ( tmax ) , terminal phase half-life ( t½ ) , terminal elimination phase rate constant ( λz ) , percentage AUC obtain extrapolation ( % AUCex ) , apparent clearance follow oral dosing ( CL/F ) apparent terminal phase volume</brief_summary>
