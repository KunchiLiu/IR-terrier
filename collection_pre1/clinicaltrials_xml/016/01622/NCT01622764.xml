	<brief_summary>The research investigator propose molecular imaging study RO5323441 , antibody placental growth factor ( PlGF ) patient recurrent GBM treat bevacizumab , drug vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Both VEGF PlGF molecule involve tumor growth since enable development tumor vasculature , thus delivery oxygen nutrient tumor . The treatment consist bevacizumab ( i.v . ) give every 2 week , patient clinical benefit ( disease progression ) unacceptable toxicity . Meanwhile , patient receive injection low protein-dose radiolabeled RO5323441 ( 89Zr-RO5323441 ) day -3 11 first bevacizumab treatment cycle . Brain-only 89Zr-RO5323441 positron emission tomography ( PET ) perform 2 hour injection 89Zr-RO5323441 day -3 11 . Whole body 89Zr-RO5323441 PET perform day 1 15 , first treatment bevacizumab . The main purpose trial determine much RO5323441 actually get recurrent GBM lesion , since drug active , able reach cancer cell . As second aim , RO5323441 accumulation normal , non-tumor organ , assess , well bevacizumab influence RO5323441 penetration tumor lesion ( answer question combine bevacizumab + RO5323441 treatment GBM ) RO5323441 biodistribution non-tumor organ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Glioblastomas ( GBM ) account 70 % glioma ( 80 % malignant brain CNS tumor ) remain aggressive sub-type glioma , particularly poor prognosis . Surgery aim complete resection first therapeutic modality , however , infiltrative nature disease make complete resection nearly impossible . In randomized , phase III EORTC-NCIC trial , overall survival newly diagnose glioblastoma patient treat concomitant temozolomide radiotherapy follow 6 cycle temozolomide 27.2 % ( 95 % CI 22.2-32.5 ) 2 year , 16.0 % ( 12.0-20.6 ) 3 year , 12.1 % ( 8.5-16.4 ) 4 year , 9.8 % ( 6.4-14.0 ) 5 year , treatment standard care . Almost GBM patient experience relapse one generally agree standard care recurrent GBM . Vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( VEGF-A ) , central regulator physiological pathological angiogenesis , consider play major angiogenic role GBM . Bevacizumab , humanize monoclonal antibody VEGF-A , show 28 % RR , 43 % 6-month PFS provide consistent clinical benefit term delay progression increase median overall survival historical control . This benefit limit however , tumor eventually evade treatment example compensatory upregulation angiogenic factor like placental growth factor ( PlGF ) . Therefore , target PlGF could new strategy tumor angiogenesis inhibition , complementary VEGF ( R ) inhibition . In preclinical setting , inhibit PlGF show inhibit growth metastasis various tumor . Humanized monoclonal PlGF antibody RO5323441 evaluate phase I trials healthy volunteer cancer patient ; Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) find , thus Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) define . Stable disease observe 6/23 patient different dose level . A phase I/II study bevacizumab combination RO5323441 currently ongoing patient recurrent GBM ( NCT01308684 ) . However , amount RO5323441 reach recurrent GBM , affect bevacizumab treatment , yet unknown . This determine repetitive measurement RO5323441 tumor uptake 89Zr-RO5323441 PET . Objectives : The objective study assess penetration RO532441 recurrent GBM 89Zr-RO5323441 PET image quantify uptake , visualize quantify 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ distribution , measure effect bevacizumab treatment 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake recurrent GBM . Study design : This single center , investigator driven , 89Zr-RO5323441 PET image bio-distribution study patient recurrent GBM treat bevacizumab . Bevacizumab dose 10 mg/kg body weight i.v . 90 min day 1 give every 2 week cycle 6 week . The treatment bevacizumab continue document disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient refusal patient 's best interest . 89Zr-RO5323441 administered i.v . tracer dose 5 mg ( 37 MBq ) day -3 day 11 cycle 1 bevacizumab treatment . Four PET scan perform ( 2 brain PET scan 2 whole body PET scan ) . Brain PET scan perform 2 hour 89Zr-RO5323441 administration day -3 day 11 , take 10 minutes/ scan . Whole body PET scan perform 4 day 89Zr-RO5323441 administration ( dose bevacizumab day 1 day 15 ) , take 50 minutes/ scan . 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake value recurrent GBM lesion baseline day 15 compare ass bevacizumab effect tracer tumor uptake . The purpose two early brain-only PET scan 89Zr-RO5323441 injection identify whether change 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake recurrent GBM lesion follow treatment bevacizumab solely attribute effect blood volume/ vascular permeability , rather indicate possible modulation placental growth factor ( PlGF ) level tumor tissue . The rationale whole body 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan assess 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ distribution baseline , well evaluate influence bevacizumab treatment could exert 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ uptake . For 89Zr-RO5323441 pharmacokinetics , blood sample take 1 hour 89Zr-RO5323441 tracer injection d-3 d11 , respectively together blood sample hematology d1 d15 1st cycle bevacizumab treatment . The rationale perform 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan data quantification assessment tracer 's blood pharmacokinetics would enable u good understand specificity 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake recurrent GBM lesion . Patients assess bevacizumab treatment response brain MRI every 6 week ( i.e . every cycle ) first 6 month every 12 week thereafter , document progression use updated RANO criterion . Treatment tracer injection relate side effect assess accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ; version 4.0 ) toxicity adverse event reporting . Main study parameters/ endpoint : 89Zr-RO5323441 tumor uptake organ distribution score visually quantitatively . Standardized uptake value ( SUV ) relative uptake value ( RUV ) determine compare recurrent GBM lesion relevant tissue baseline day 15 . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Bevacizumab register The Netherlands use metastasize colon breast cancer , lung cancer advance renal cell carcinoma already test GBM clinical trial . Bevacizumab expect clinical benefit patient enrol study similar safety profile compare indication . RO5323441 monotherapy well tolerated patient advance malignant disease . In study , one patient receive low total protein dose 10 mg RO5323441 ( 2X5mg ) tracer expect RO5323441 enhance bevacizumab related side effect . The total radiation dose 89Zr-RO5323441 patient participate study would 36 mSv woman 30 mSv men . According investigator radiation burden justifiable patient group information obtain study . Risk : exposure 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan-related radiation , possibility allergic reaction protein tracer , possible side-effects bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
