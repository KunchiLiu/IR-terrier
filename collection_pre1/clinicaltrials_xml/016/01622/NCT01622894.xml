	<brief_summary>Genetics mendelian form young onset Alzheimer Disease ( GMAJ project ) Introduction : Autosomal dominant form Alzheimer disease ( AD ) characterize young age onset . In France prevalence estimate around 1000 case . The Phenotypical Expression : There diversity phenotypical expression , associate dementia , spastic paraplegia , early extrapyramidal syndrome , ataxia stroke cause severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy . Diversity neuropathological expression demonstrate presence cotton wool plaque , Lewy body Lewy neurites severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy . The study mendelian form decisive physiopathological comprehension AD related disease , since alteration gene involve sufficient cause disease . In AD , identification genetic cause allow formulation amyloid hypothesis , basis current therapeutic development concern Ab peptide . Currently three gene ( APP , PSEN1 , PSEN2 ) identify early onset mendelian form mutation involve 80 % 139 French family , study since 1993 within framework U614 National Reference Centre Alzheimer Disease young subject ( CNR-MAJ ) .These result argument favor GMAJ project two main objective : ( ) identify new gene mendelian AD form without detectable alteration know gene . ( ii ) correlate phenotype genotype within family associate known mutation extend description phenotypical spectrum . Population : Families eligible study least 2 individual AD criterion ( clinical neuropathological ) onset 65 year age . Duration inclusion 3 year . This multicentre study group 23 clinical centre . The inclusion number 50 new family per year . Method : Extension description family unknown genetic cause , inclusion novel family autosomal dominant AD . The successive step project follow : ( ) Thorough phenotypical characterization order document family history characterize probands affected related subject accord standardize protocol clinical , neuropsychological , biological ( biomarker determination plasma cerebrospinal fluid ) image data ( MRI , TEMP ) . ( ii ) Identify know genetic cause ( PSEN1/2 , APP ) novel autosomal dominant family . ( iii ) Extend analysis pedigree family unknown genetic cause . ( iv ) Identify novel genetic cause within family negative known mutation . This study use 3 method : - pangenomic search perform microalterations ( Copy Number Variants CNV ) Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( CGH ) high resolution ( 10 kb average ) . - potential target validate study large control population , intrafamilial cosegregation functional validation . - remain family end stage characterize mean high throughput sequence exonic area . ( v ) Follow study patient sibling 2 goal : - evaluation disease course consequence ( individual , familial social ) ; - occurrence novel AD case within family . ( vi ) Neuropathological description potential novel description atypical AD case . Results consequence : Identification novel genetic cause AD importance complete mechanism amyloidergic hypothesis . This project useful promote guideline genetic diagnosis AD France .</brief_summary>
