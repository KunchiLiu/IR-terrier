	<brief_summary>This clinical trial determine addition standard care drug , interferon-alfa 2b ( IFN ) , investigation vaccine affect immune system and/or cancer . The investigational vaccine make gene specific melanoma give intradermally ( i.d . ) every two week total 3 vaccine . After vaccine , subject randomize either receive boost high dose IFN boost . IFN administer intravenously ( vein ) 5 consecutive day ( Monday Friday ) every week 4 week . Administration begin approximately 30 day ( ± 7 day ) 3rd vaccine . The first dose IFNα2b may begin within 10 business day randomization . All subsequent procedure date Group A base date first dose IFNα2b .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I , single site study evaluate immunological effect autologous DC transduce MART-1 , tyrosinase MAGE-A6 ( melanoma associate antigen , MAA ) gene 30 subject recurrent , unresectable stage III , IV metastatic melanoma ( M1a , M1b , M1c ) . AdVTMM2-transduced DC , 10e7 , give intradermally ( i.d . ) every two week total 3 vaccine . After DC vaccine , subject randomize either receive boost high dose IFNa2b boost . Subjects randomize receive IFNa2b boost receive Interferon-a2b , 20 MU/m2/d ( round nearest 1 million unit ) administer intravenously 5 consecutive day ( Monday Friday ) every week 4 week ( induction ) . Administration begin approximately 30 day ( ± 7 day ) 3rd vaccine . The first dose IFNα2b may begin within 10 business day randomization . All subsequent procedure date Group A base date first dose IFNα2b.. The end-points study local systemic toxicity , immunological response , generation determinant spread anti-tumor immunity , clinical response .</detailed_description>
