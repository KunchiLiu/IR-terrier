	<brief_summary>Excellent immune response follow 1 2 dos GSK monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 ( pH1N1 ) vaccine ( e.g. , Arepanrix® ) document several trial . Observational study find vaccine effective prevent laboratory confirm influenza infection . However , remain unclear whether vaccination pandemic associate reduction clinically meaningful outcome , hospitalization , severe illness , complication , death . The investigator propose evaluate effectiveness GSK adjuvanted non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine use Manitoba prevent hospitalization severe illness ( defined illness necessitate admission intensive care associate major complication ) due influenza pneumonia mean case-control study use data Manitoba Health ( MH ) administrative database database Cadham Provincial Laboratory . The primary outcome hospitalization laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia . A secondary outcome hospitalization influenza pneumonia . The investigator also assess effectiveness vaccine different age group among high-risk population , e.g. , immunocompromised individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Testing influenza largely discretionary patient present influenza-like illness ( ILI ) could effectively safely manage even diagnosis confirm . So , unclear whether reduction risk laboratory-confirmed influenza mild ILI among vaccinated individual much clinical significance . In contrast , hospitalization due influenza pneumonia usually discretionary , clinical public health perspective avoid hospitalization important relevant objective influenza control mere reduction laboratory-confirmed case . Thus far observational study examine effectiveness H1N1 vaccine hospitalization , significant limitation include small sample size , information limit certain age group ( e.g. , child ) potential selection recall bias . Using data Scottish general practice sentinel surveillance network , Simpson et al report adjuvanted GSK vaccine 95 % ( 76-100 % ) effective laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection , 100 % ( ∞-100 % ) effective hospitalization influenza pneumonia . Unexpectedly , vaccine equally effective among 'high-risk ' group . Small number case limited precision estimate ; above-mentioned estimate vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) hospitalization base one case , reason wide confidence interval compatible VE estimate ( ∞-100 % ) . A hospital-based case-control study Spain show use several pandemic vaccine associate 90 % effectiveness prevent laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection among hospitalized patient . That study population-based limited small number fully-vaccinated subject ( 7 subject receive pandemic vaccine ≥ 7 day symptom onset ) . Two Canadian study examine effectiveness GSK adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine : one small ( 28 case ) limit child 10 year . The study Skowronski et al . use data Canadian VE sentinel network examine VE hospitalization , , small . In Canadian province Manitoba , mass immunization pandemic H1N1 commence October 26th 2010 use primarily large scale vaccination clinic lead public health team last approximately 8 week . Initially , Canadian-manufactured Arepanrix® , AS03-adjuvanted split virion pandemic H1N1 vaccine ( GlaxoSmithKline [ GSK ] ) , use vaccinate adult child 6 month age . Later , two nonadjuvanted vaccine , CSL Limited GSK , offer pregnant woman child 10 year age . The seasonal trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) —Fluviral® ( GSK ) Vaxigrip® ( Sanofi Pasteur ) — less frequently administer . All vaccine offer free charge , limited vaccine supply campaign start necessitate development priority group early vaccination . The initial priority group Manitoba include health care worker , Aboriginal person , pregnant woman , 6-60 months-old child , individual 65 year chronic medical condition , immunocompromised individual resident remote community . On November 18,2010 , pandemic H1N1 vaccine make available whole population . This study evaluate effectiveness GSK adjuvanted non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccine use Manitoba prevent hospitalization severe illness . The advantage propose study exist literature related availability high-quality population-based health administrative database cover well-defined population . The whole population Manitoba eligible available inclusion study , selection bias concern . Ascertainment case virtually complete admit influenza pneumonia case province capture Hospital Abstract database . The availability detailed history vaccination , unique Manitoba Immunization Registry eliminate recall bias , reduces vaccine use measurement error ( e.g. , due patient confusion vaccine receive ) permit detailed assessment effect time vaccination risk hospitalization . These detailed analysis facilitate large sample size ( 40 % Manitoba 's 1.2 million population vaccinate ) .</detailed_description>
