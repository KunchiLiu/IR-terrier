	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery without lapatinib ditosylate work treat patient breast cancer many protein call human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) cell spread brain . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Stereotactic radiosurgery specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery together lapatinib ditosylate effective treatment brain metastasis breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Without Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Brain Metastasis From HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine signal increase complete response ( CR ) rate measurable brain metastasis 12 week post radiation therapy ( RT ) ( whole brain stereotactic radiosurgery [ SRS ] ) determine magnetic-resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain , addition lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate CR rate measurable brain metastasis 4 week post RT ( WBRT/SRS ) determine MRI scan brain , addition lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . II . To evaluate objective response rate measurable brain metastasis 4 12 week post RT ( WBRT/SRS ) determine MRI scan brain , addition lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . III . To evaluate target lesion-specific objective response rate ( CR + partial response [ PR ] ) 4 12 week post WBRT/SRS . IV . To evaluate central nervous system ( CNS ) progressive disease outside target measurable disease addition lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . V. To evaluate target lesion-specific progression 4 12 week post WBRT/SRS . VI . To evaluate treatment related adverse event add lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . VII . To evaluate overall CNS complete response : disappearance CNS target lesion sustain least 4 week ; new lesion , use corticosteroid , patient stable improve clinically , add lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . VIII . To evaluate overall CNS progressive disease ( within outside target measurable disease ) addition lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . IX . To evaluate overall survival add lapatinib WBRT/SRS compare WBRT/SRS alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo WBRT 5 day week 3 week total 15 treatment SRS 1 treatment . ARM B : Patients undergo WBRT SRS Arm A . Patients also receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 6 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 12 week every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
