	<brief_summary>Amputees often choose wear prosthesis due marginal performance may settle prosthesis offer cosmetic improvement , lack function . A simulation tool consist robotics-based human body model ( RHBM ) predict functional motion , integrate module aid prescription , training , comparative study , determination design parameter upper extremity prosthesis develop . The main objective collect analyze human movement several common task optimize validate robotics base human model . The range motion data subject perform activity daily live open door , turn wheel , grooming , eat , bilateral lifting , well recreational sport activity swing baseball bat , golf club analyze . This motion analysis data also use compare data four group : control group ( n=10 ) , brace group simulate prosthesis use ( n=10 ) , group wear transradial prosthesis ( n=10 ) group wear transhumeral prosthesis ( n =10 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data collect 8 camera ViconÂ© motion analysis system one 3-4 hour test period . Forty-five reflective marker attach subject skin clothing via double side adhesive electrode collar . The cameras work infrared spectrum marker passive reflective sphere . Relations marker position anatomical / know position body use calculate position body segments.This analysis provide information movement strategy , compensatory motion , socket movement associate select task transradial transhumeral prosthesis . Differences range motion prostheses user control subject calculate determine compensatory motion . The movement prosthesis 's socket function task factor also measure . Measured data use minimize error simulation upper body movement . Knowledge human motor function give record data extend give insight movement parameter design new prosthetics . Simulations optimize collect data use regressive best fit method .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject capable provide informed consent . Normal healthy adult subject upper limb amputee currently use prosthesis complete activity daily live include . Subjects young 18 old 65 exclude . Adults unable consent exclude study . Subjects health issue injury would prevent lift five pound complete simple task daily live exclude study . Subjects ask able lift five pound , open door drink cup without pain injury . Before study set recording begin , subject ask practice task insure capable completing . Pregnant woman exclude study due change physical ability pregnancy .</criteria>
