	<criteria>Patients must histological diagnosis colorectal adenocarcinoma . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available translational study must provide informed consent release block . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . The criterion define measurable disease follow : Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm measure short axis Patients must advance metastatic disease , curative therapy exist systemic therapy indicate . ECOG performance 0 , 1 2 . Age ≥ 18 year age . Previous Therapy Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 21days prior patient randomization wound heal occur . Chemotherapy : Patients may NOT receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy advance metastatic disease . Prior adjuvant fluoropyrimidinebased therapy permit provide complete least one year prior enrollment regimen include oxaliplatin bevacizumab . Exceptions may make low dose chemotherapy give radiosensitizing agent . Other Therapy : Patients may receive therapy include immunotherapy , signal transduction inhibitor , provide patient recover reversible drug relate toxicity ( exception alopecia ) adequate washout period meet . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) ALT AST ≤ 3 x ULN ( Note : ≤ 5 x ULN document liver metastasis ) Proteinuria &lt; 2g/24 hr ( screen use spot testing ; ≥ grade 2 repeat midstream urine still ≥ grade 2 urine collection 24 hour confirm &lt; 2g/24hrs ) Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life ( EORTC QLQC30 ) either English French . The baseline assessment must already complete . Inability ( illiteracy English French , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . The baseline assessment must complete within 14 day prior randomization . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . ( Please call NCIC CTG question interpretation criterion ) . Patients immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. Patients active uncontrolled infection serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients significant cardiac ( include uncontrolled hypertension ) pulmonary disease , active CNS disease infection . Patients eligible know hypersensitivity study drug ( ) component . Patients history central nervous system metastasis untreated spinal cord compression . Patients prior treatment oxaliplatin bevacizumab , contraindication treatment 5FU ( e.g . know DPD deficiency severe cardiac disease ) , neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . Patients sterile unless use adequate method birth control .</criteria>
