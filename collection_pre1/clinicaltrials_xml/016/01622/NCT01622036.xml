Malnutrition severe complication , cancer cachexia , negative prognostic factor neoplastic patient , induce Decreased response tolerance antineoplastic treatment , decline functional status , reduce quality life reduce survival . Prevalence data malnutrition italian oncology patient lack available literature data weight loss malnutrition oncology refer patient different phase disease therapy . Most importantly , strategy prevention malnutrition cachexia oncology still largely disregard scarcely implement . The main objective project assess prevalence malnutrition patient undergo first medical oncology visit Italy . Secondary objective increase awareness metabolic nutritional issue among medical oncologist , thus favor inclusion metabolic-nutritional screen monitoring medical oncology protocol .

	<brief_title>Prevalence Malnutrition Oncology ( PreMiO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acronym project `` PreMiO '' mean `` Prevalence Malnutrition Oncology '' . The project arise observation negative consequence cancer-related malnutrition cachexia still largely underestimated oncology unit , Europe USA . Indeed , prevention treatment nutritional metabolic sequela cancer treatment , perceive priority oncologist . This quite surprising , consider body evidence demonstrate deterioration nutritional status adversely affect treatment response , morbidity , quality life survival cancer patient . In word , malnourish cachectic cancer patient lose chance adequately treat underlying disease . Approximately one quarter death western society due cancer . Half patient cancer lose body weight ; one third lose 5 % original body weight 20 % cancer death cause directly cachexia . The great prevalence weight loss see among patient solid tumour : gastric , pancreatic , lung , colorectal , head neck . The overall prevalence weight loss cancer patient may rise high 86 % last 1-2 week life.The pathogenesis weight loss , malnutrition cachexia cancer multifactorial represent result complex interplay tumor , host 's metabolism , tumor-derived host-derived humoral factor , negative consequence anticancer treatment patient 's ability assume , absorb metabolize nutrient . Objectives The objective PreMiO project obtain data prevalence malnutrition Italian cancer patient undergo first medical oncology visit . The project innovative since oncologist , nutrition specialist , perform nutritional evaluation patient . The data obtain contribute increase awareness metabolic nutritional problem oncology , favor inclusion initial assessment nutritional-metabolic monitoring oncological protocol . Patients Methods `` PreMIO '' prospective , multicentre observational study , design ass nutritional status cancer patient present first visit oncological center . Enrollment conduct Italian ESMO-accredited center medical oncological center Italy . Six-thousand patient consider adequate sample suitable estimation prevalence malnutrition Italian cancer patient first medical oncology visit . Patient recruitment ensure enrollment 60 center throughout Italian national territory ( North , Center , South ) . The instrument use patient ' evaluation Mini Nutritional Assessment ® ( MNA ® ) criteria diagnosis pre-cachexia elaborate ESPEN . Pre-cachexia clinical condition characterize , context chronic disease ( i.e . cancer ) , unintentional weigh loss ≤ 5 % last 6 month , chronic systemic inflammation anorexia anorexia-related symptom . Although nutritional tool available nutritional status evaluation ( Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 , NRS 2002 ; Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool , MUST ) , even oncological setting ( Subjective Global Assessment , SGA ; Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment , PG-SGA ) , choose MNA® diagnostic sensitivity rapidity administration . The MNA ® consist first screening part second part global assessment , allow obtain score reflect patient nutritional status . Moreover , instrument recently consider best screen method nutrition status patient metastatic lung cancer . The data generate participate center collect Coordinator Centre ( IDI-IRCCS ) . Patients stratify accord cancer type localization , disease stage , age , sex , general condition . It expect prevalence malnutrition pre- cachexia vary widely , depend tumor type , localization , stage previous surgical treatment . Multivariate analysis allow discriminate among factor contribute occurrence prevalence malnutrition study population .</detailed_description>
