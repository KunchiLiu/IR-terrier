	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine Cisplatin standard chemotherapy drug use treat advanced urothelial cancer . There standard chemotherapy patient receive Cisplatin . However , patient treat chemotherapy drug Gemcitabine Carboplatin . In study , researcher hope learn effect , good and/or bad , combination Gemcitabine Pazopanib urothelial cancer . Gemcitabine give intravenously ( vein ) work kill rapidly divide cell body , include cancer cell . Pazopanib oral chemotherapy work decrease blood supply tumor limit tumor 's source oxygen nutrient . The combination Gemcitabine Pazopanib test research study one . As August 2011 , 18 patient various type cancer receive treatment Gemcitabine Pazopanib . The main goal clinical research study learn study drug Gemcitabine Pazopanib shrink slow growth urothelial cancer . The safety drug also study . The physical state , change size tumor , laboratory finding help u decide combination Gemcitabine Pazopanib safe effective .</brief_summary>
