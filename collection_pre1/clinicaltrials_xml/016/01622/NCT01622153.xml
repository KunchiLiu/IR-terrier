	<detailed_description>The health teeth , support tissue maintain integrity primary goal pulp therapy . Conservative pulp therapy primary teeth aim maintain pulp vitality , reduce need pulpectomy , promote integrity retention teeth appropriate exfoliation . ( 51 ) A pulpotomy usually perform carious exposure primary teeth normal pulp reversible coronal pulpitis , primary teeth pulpally expose trauma ( AAPD 2009 ) . A pulpotomy require healthy radicular pulp capable heal amputation inflame infected coronal pulp [ Fuks Eidelman , 1991 ] . After coronal pulp amputate , remain vital radicular pulp tissue surface treat long-term clinically successful medicament Buckley 's Solution formocresol . ( 46-52 ) Electrosurgery also demonstrate success . ( 53 ) The coronal pulp chamber fill zinc/oxide , eugenol , suitable base , tooth restore restoration seal tooth microleakage . The effective long-term restoration show stainless steel crown . When coronal tissue amputate , remain radicular tissue judge vital without suppuration , purulence , necrosis , excessive hemorrhage control damp cotton pellet several minute . In addition , radiographic sign infection pathologic resorption pulpotomy procedure indicate . ( Camp JH , Fuks AB ) Despite concern toxicity , mutagenicity carcinogenicity [ Swenberg et al. , 1980 ; Goldmacher Thilly , 1983 ; Ranly Horn , 1987 ] , formocresol ( FC ) remain commonly use primary tooth pulpotomy medicament [ Hingston et al. , 2007 ] . Various clinical radiographic success rate ( 59-100 % ) report [ Mejare , 1979 ; Naik Hegde , 2005 ] , attribute intra-patient variation , clinician assessor factor , FC concentration application time , coronal seal , study duration . As technology continue improve , allow dentist treat patient great precision , mean less pain quicker healing . The diode laser use many different dental procedure . It commonly use perform soft-tissue surgery mouth . The diode laser 's high-energy beam kill bacteria , thus often used sterilize area mouth root canal procedure . ( Laser-dentistry/diode-laser ) The diode laser represent whole new way think dental care . Laser treatment less painful , convenient , effective many traditional dental treatment . A study Bahrololoomi Z , Moeintaghavi A , compare FC electrosurgery pulpotomy nine month follow find clinical radiographical success rate 96 % 84 % respectively electrosurgical group 100 % 96.8 % respectively formocresol group . There statistical significance result show failure rate electrosurgery pulpotomy equal formocresol pulpotomy . Purpose : Dental care recently identify prevalent unmet health need amongst US child ( AAPD 2009 ) . This research study investigate another treatment method help provide dental care child evaluate success rate laser ( electrical ) pulpotomy compare formocresol pulpotomy primary molar carious pulp exposure . There need study assess laser pulpotomy method order help create efficient painless treatment . Study Design Procedures : We perform prospective study clinical evaluation patient range age 3-8 year old treat general anesthesia June , 2010 June , 2014 . The review analysis complete four year time period . The patient participate study include present patient Tapper Pediatric Dentistry clinic Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital . These patient schedule treated operating room indicate best treatment option . Treatment General Anesthesia indicate : 1 . Patient uncooperative due lack psychological emotional maturity and/or mental , physical , medical disability . 2 . Patients local anesthesia ineffective acute infection , anatomic variation , allergy . 3 . Extremely uncooperative , fearful , anxious , uncommunicative child adolescent . 4 . Patients require significant surgical procedure . 5 . Patients use GA may protect develop psyche and/or reduce medical risk . 6 . Patients require immediate , comprehensive oral/dental care ( AAPD 2009 ) . The patient consent informed day OR appointment . They give specific post-op instruction verbally write form . They schedule two-week follow-up appointment clinic follow dental treatment . Informed consent must obtain parent/guardian patient participate study receive pulpotomy treatment laser technique . Other patient , regardless study , pulpotomy treatment use traditional formocresol technique . All patient receive general endotracheal anesthesia receive comprehensive dental treatment . General anesthesia provide use combination inhale anesthetic propofol intravenously . General anesthesia supplement intravenous opioid analgesic , ketorolac unless contraindicate , anti-mimetics . The anesthetic approach influence participation non-participation patient study . The patient 's name , date birth , medical history obtain patient chart . This PHI utilized keep track patient demographic study . Patients schedule operating room see post-op two week follow appointment regular dental visit regardless whether participate study . Of eligible subject randomize clinical trial perform 90 primary molar child age 3-8 year . Two preoperative bite wing radiograph take . The teeth treat pulp therapy use either conventional formocresol ( 30 control 30 study teeth ) GENTLEray 980 Soft Tissue diode laser ( 30 study teeth ) technique . 30 Controls : The procedure 30 subject conduct use # 8 round diamond bur remove occlusal tooth structure pulp chamber access removal coronal pulp . Cotton pellet saturate conventional 1:5 dilution Buckley 's formocresol canal orifice 5 minute complete hemostasis . After , Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12 % rinse apply decrease bacterial level . Then , placement 35 % Phosphoric Acid Etch 15-30 second rinse dried tooth white , chalky appearance . One layer Optibond Solo place pulp chamber light cure 10 second 3M ESPE Elipar S10 light cure device . IRM ( Zinc Oxide Eugenol ) cement place seal pulp chamber . A stainless steel crown cement Ketac Cement triturated 10 second complete pulpotomy procedure final restoration . 30 Conventional Formocresol : The procedure 30 subject conduct use # 8 round diamond bur remove occlusal tooth structure pulp chamber access removal coronal pulp . Cotton pellet saturate conventional 1:5 dilution Buckley 's formocresol canal orifice 5 minute complete hemostasis . After , Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12 % rinse apply decrease bacterial level . Then , placement 35 % Phosphoric Acid Etch 15-30 second rinse dried tooth white , chalky appearance . One layer Optibond Solo place pulp chamber light cure 10 second 3M ESPE Elipar S10 light cure device . Dyract compomer place seal pulp chamber . A stainless steel crown cement Ketac Cement triturated 10 second complete pulpotomy procedure final restoration . 30 Laser Diode : The procedure 30 subject conduct use # 8 round diamond bur remove occlusal tooth structure pulp chamber access removal coronal pulp . Then GENTLEray 980 Soft Tissue diode laser ( Power : 3.0W , Mode : PW , Fiber : 300Âµm , Ton : 100ms , Toff : 100ms , Timer : cont ) use vaporize residual pulp tissue complete hemostasis . After completion hemostasis , Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12 % rinse apply decrease bacterial presence . Subjects receive placement 35 % Phosphoric Acid Etch 15-30 second follow 10 second light cure optibond solo . IRM ( Zinc Oxide Eugenol ) cement place seal pulp chamber . A stainless steel crown cement Ketac Cement full coverage final restoration complete pulpotomy procedure . Following pulpotomy procedure , teeth evaluate clinical radiographic success 6 month post-op 12 month post-op appointment Tapper Pediatric Dental Clinic Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital . The study teeth treat evaluate clinically base presence follow : ( 1 ) pain ( 2 ) abscess ( 3 ) mobility . Radiographic success determine evaluate bite wing x-ray take two post-op appointment presence following : ( 1 ) internal resorption ( 2 ) external resorption ( 3 ) furcation radiolucency . Risks : The physical risk laser therapy risk eye damage . While eye damage report date , must still consider possible risk . Because study subject General Anesthesia eye already close cover . Suitable protective goggles wear investigator assistant . Other possible risk associate study include risk anesthesia- ( Nausea , vomiting , epistaxis , fever , discomfort/pain ) . There minimal risk involve research study . Benefits : Pulpotomy treatment maintain vitality tooth well support tissue . The longevity prognosis laser pulpotomy versus formocresol pulpotomy treatment consider beneficial . Through research study , prove new finding . Maintaining primary dentition extremely important study provide insight advance dental technology help well treat carious teeth efficient painless way . Alternatives : Due nature research alternative participate study .</detailed_description>
