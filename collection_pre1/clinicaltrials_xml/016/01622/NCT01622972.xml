	<brief_summary>The University Nottingham develop new , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques image bowel . Building study investigator want study , healthy volunteer , effect purge colon . The investigator plan two study use novel MRI technique healthy volunteer demonstrate dos preparation design clean bowel alters small large bowel water content transit . The investigator also define change induce colonic microbiota link change transit structure colonic content . This experimental model comparable episode acute diarrhea , therefore study also improve understand effect diarrhea bowel physiology . Following study , investigator would like extend study patient functional constipation previously respond conventional laxative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mode Action Moviprep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine examination colon include colonoscopy barium enema widely carry clinical practice require evacuation colonic content . This conveniently carry use osmotic laxative widely use preparation base polyethylene glycol Moviprep . When fully make 1 litre Moviprep , provide 100 gram polyethlene glycol '3350 ' measured osmolarity around 530 mosmol/l . Being nonnutrient , would expect rapidly leave stomach generate substantial inflow fluid upper small intestine water flow osmotic gradient markedly increase small intestinal water content compare fasting . Previous MRI study use Mannitol solution 300 mosmols/l result small bowel secretion fluid increase total small bowel water nearly 400 mls 300 ml meal . The investigator would anticipate much large increase hypertonic Moviprep . The flush small bowel fluid induce mannitol produce radical change heterogeneous structure ascend colon show recent MRI image colon mannitol . Contrary expectation colonic content far homogenous spatially organise bacterial flora others describe microscopic level investigator begin demonstrate use novel MRI technique . The colon regard complex bioreactor spatially highly organise mucous layer overlie enterocytes , out layer mucus contain germinal layer bacteria reseed bioreactor purge . The rate recovery purgation polyethylene glycol say normally rapid intact germinal layer rapidly recolonises slow certain patient group though data limit yet . The anecdotal yet persuasive patient account improvement bowel function colonic lavage suggest reconstitute microbiota may different , though yet study use modern technique . Until recently investigator way noninvasive imaging complex structure recent development high resolution MRI Nottingham show feasible . Pilot data demonstrate purge remove heterogeneous three dimensional structure leave homogeneous fluid content intense proton signal . Just impact colonic microbiota yet unknown study date combine novel approach new technique available assess microbiota . Early culture-based assessment identify minority faecal organism present last decade method base assessment microbial DNA evolve make possible describe full complexity faecal microbiota . PCR highly conserve 16 ribosomal RNA gene show microbiota individual highly complex individualise . Similarity indices show similarity around two third 7 week period healthy control develop acute diarrhoea due radiation enteritis show mark reduction 26 % . Similarly , HITChip analysis show subject IBS unstable microbiota stabilise follow probiotic intervention trial improve IBS symptom score . These technique yet apply subject undergo bowel purgation . Moreover , novel approach identify viability microbiota use specific probe allow discrimination intact , damage dead cell fecal sample .</detailed_description>
