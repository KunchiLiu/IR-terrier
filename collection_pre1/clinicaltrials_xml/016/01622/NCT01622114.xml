	<brief_summary>Achievement maintenance weight loss obese individual proven difficult . Many hypothesis suggest potential biological mechanism explain weight loss attempt often fail , surround obesogenic environment also seem obvious candidate . Among biological factor propose gender , weight loss trial frequently show female less successful male lose weight maintain weight loss . Women 's weight influence menstrual cycle , change hormonal level interaction work modulate fertility . These hormone control menstrual cycle coordinate require change energy intake , expenditure , storage , whilst prepare body pregnancy every month . As reproduction primary biological function , hormone may strong mediator eat behavior influence outcome weight loss attempt . The menstrual cycle therefore take consideration factor physiology energy balance premenopausal woman . The cycle divide three phase : menstruation early follicular phase ( day 1-5 ) , late follicular phase last ovulation ( ~days 6-14 , luteal phase ( day 15-28 ) . Studies show luteal phase menstrual cycle , woman 's energy intake energy expenditure increase woman experience frequent craving food , particularly high carbohydrate fat , follicular phase . A trend towards reduce carbohydrate utilization increase fat oxidation luteal phase also report , together prolonged time exhaustion exercise submaximal intensity . This suggest potential underlie physiology related phase menstrual cycle may worth consider element strategy optimize weight loss . In 2010 investigator carry 90-day randomize , control pilot study order gain feedback ass acceptance meal exercise plan use observe less control visit plan main study sufficient achieve good compliance . Twenty eight sreened 24 include . Subjects randomize either program A ( give meal exercise plan relation phase menstrual cycle ) Program B ( reduce calorie diet , calorie-matched program A ) . The pilot study show Group A ( The Menstralean group ) tend great average weight loss 60 day ( -5.29 v -3.57 kg , p = 0.06 ) 90 day ( -4.22 v -2.75 kg , p = 0.2 ) compare control group . There dropout rate 27 % . This primarily due inadequate number control visit contact subject . Thus Menstralean program seem potential enhance weight loss overweight obese woman . However , main study carry subject group long duration support contact subject . The aim present trial examine impact menstrual cycle weight loss attempt healthy overweight ( BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2 ) premenopausal woman ( 18-40 year ) randomize two different weight management program period 6 month .</brief_summary>
