	<brief_summary>Since abdominal wall hernia repair currently perform use mesh , side effect associate mesh frequently report long term follow-up . These side effect relate shrinkage mesh , adhesion bowl , pain , inflammation skin bowl . To reduce prevent effect , fully resorb mesh develop , provide sufficient support strength allow efficient recovery abdominal wall , also disappear body three year time , longer synthetic material body . Previous resorb mesh also disappear much short period time , hernia insufficiently heal , recurrence result . The TIGR™ mesh ( resorbable mesh use study ) principle synthetic mesh , make two commonly use polymer , however retain 50 % initial strength six month . This theory enough provide support collagen heal process initial wound-healing phase , also support transition initial collagen functional collagen . The aim study compare TIGR™ large pore mesh use repair anterior abdominal wall repair ( incisional hernia , umbilical hernia , etc..Inguinal hernia part study ) . Therefore patient divide two group , one group treat resorb mesh , group treat permanent mesh . Otherwise difference medication surgical technique use .</brief_summary>
