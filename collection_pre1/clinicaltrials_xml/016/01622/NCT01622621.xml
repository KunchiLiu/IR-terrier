	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Versus Sublobar Resection High-Risk Patients Non-Small Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care Stage I Non-Small Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) sublobar surgical resection . Recent trial suggest early stage NSCLC might successfully treat SBRT amongst medically inoperable . SBRT precise delivery high dose radiation control tumor limit damage surround normal tissue . Patients SBRT arm receive 54 Grays ( Gy ) 3 fraction . One gray absorption one joule energy , form ionizing radiation , per kilogram matter . Recent advance three-dimensional conformal Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) techniques compensate lung motion allow delivery high-dose , single fraction primary lung tumor patient clinical state I NSCLC . Local control survival result appear promise . SBRT early stage lung cancer may offer potentially equivalent , non-invasive treatment alternative surgical resection . Additionally , SBRT may associate few complication well quality life . SBRT may acceptable even preferred treatment option higher-risk patient able tolerate surgical lobectomy . This clinical dilemma increasingly face lung cancer practice Mayo Clinic , comparative effectiveness data guide treatment decision . Patients evaluate Thoracic Surgery Radiation Oncology . Randomization occur either group patient must see consultation prior randomization . For patient meet enrollment criterion unwilling participate randomization , observational arm SBRT sublobar resection enroll 24 patient part 96 patient total . The patient receive follow test part clinical care : - Computed Tomography ( CT ) -Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) use mediastinal image - Endobronchial/endoscopic ultrasound ( EBUS/EUS ) -Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) mediastinoscopy use pathologic assessment level 2 lymph node ( N2 ) great 1 cm short axis CT scan and/or SUV great 1.5 fold background - Follow-up CT scan 6 month , 12 month , 18 month , 24 month Surgery SBRT group . - Follow-up Pulmonary Function Tests 1 year</detailed_description>
