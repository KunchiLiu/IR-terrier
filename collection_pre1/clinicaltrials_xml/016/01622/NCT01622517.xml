	<brief_summary>The overall goal CTP predict Response recanalization Ischemic Stroke Project ( CRISP ) develop practical tool identify acute stroke patient likely benefit endovascular therapy . The project two main part . During first part , investigator propose develop fully automate system ( RAPID ) process CT Perfusion ( CTP ) image generate brain map ischemic core penumbra . There patient enrollment part one project . During second part , investigator aim demonstrate physician emergency setting , aid fully automate CTP analysis program ( RAPID ) , accurately predict response recanalization stroke patient undergoing revascularization . To achieve aim investigator conduct prospective cohort study 240 consecutive stroke patient undergo CTP scan prior endovascular therapy . The study conduct four site ( Stanford University , St Luke 's Hospital , University Pittsburgh Medical Center , Emory University/Grady Hospital ) . Patients early follow-up MRI scan within 12+/-6 hour assess reperfusion late follow-up MRI scan day 5 determine final infarct .</brief_summary>
