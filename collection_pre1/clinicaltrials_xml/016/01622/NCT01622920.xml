	<brief_summary>The investigator establish technique measure enamel thickness show work well in-vitro . The teeth test far , obtain Dental School Tissue Bank , molars pre-molars . In case , measurement make difficult curvature tooth surface seem likely flatter large , incisor would give satisfactory result . The investigator therefore wish establish in-vivo whether hypothesis correct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preliminary Clinical Study Ultrasound Measure Enamel Thickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim translate research clinical hand-held dental tool could use measure enamel thickness less curvaceous anterior incisor ( front ) teeth , ultimately monitor erosive tooth surface loss ( TSL ) , mainly occur anterior ( front ) teeth occlusal ( top ) surface posterior ( back ) teeth . In study , quantify enamel thickness ultrasound provide data assess reproducibility determine whether ultrasound potentially viable tool measure monitor acid erosion teeth . This would allow dentist reinforce advice patient reduce acidic consumption , motivate keep whatever remain 'precious ' enamel tissue , lose , necessitate filling make . These filling require future repair possible remake , median survival rate five year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Healthy adult 18 year ( female male ) normal salivary flow . 2 . Volunteers absence dental caries and/or periodontal disease maxillary incisor ( upper front teeth ) use study . 3 . Volunteers sound maxillary incisor obvious crack crown . 4 . Volunteers willingly sign informed consent . 5 . Volunteers willing follow research schedule period study . 1 . Volunteers abnormal enamel maxillary incisor assess visual inspection . 2 . Volunteers replace enamel maxillary incisor ( eg filling , crown , bridge ) . 3 . Volunteers appear hypoplastic teeth part syndrome , e.g . osteogenesis imperfect . 4 . Volunteers orthodontic appliance front teeth , presence fix removable denture ( replace miss front teeth ) . 5 . Volunteers complex dental history periodontitis , dentine sensitivity salivary dysfunction . 6 . Volunteers condition could expect interfere volunteer 's safety study . 7 . Volunteers demonstrate inability comply study procedure . 8 . Signed informed consent obtain volunteer .</criteria>
