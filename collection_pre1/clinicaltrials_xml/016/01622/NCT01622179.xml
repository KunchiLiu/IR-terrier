	<brief_title>Outcome Two Different Suture Methods Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achilles tendon rupture one common tendon injury adult population . The incidence injury increase age adult continue participation high-demand sport . Although impact Achilles tendon rupture substantial , often result prolonged disability rehabilitation . Studies show operation treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture advantage . But rebuild blood supply involve previous study . And epitenon tendon interior layer , close endotenons contain vascular supply . Main difference two suture method epitenon repair sew indirectly unrepaired sew directly .</detailed_description>
