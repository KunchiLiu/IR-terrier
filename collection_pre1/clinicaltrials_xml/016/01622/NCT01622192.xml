	<brief_summary>The aim study determine best method measure extent severity gum disease compare repeatability probe depth achieve manual probe compare automate probe . Hypothesis The null hypothesis test include - The automated probe improve reproducibility periodontal probing compare manual probing recording - The automated probe show advantage compare reproducibility - Moderate sit - Deep site - Single vs. multirooted teeth - Different sextant - Different surface teeth Buccal vs. palatal/lingual Mesial vs. mid vs. distal</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Measuring clinical attachment loss use periodontal probe benchmark attachment loss diagnose periodontal disease . The accuracy reproducibility probe measurement essential part diagnosis , treatment planning assessment treatment outcome . There inherent error associate probe identify literature . These relate operator technique , probe use state inflammation periodontal pocket/crevice . The aim study compare reproducibility probe measurement use probe tip millimeter marking 15mm Florida probe ® handpiece . This tip use allow conventional clinical measurement record time electronic recording Florida probe ® . The examiner would take manual probe measurement blind electronic reading take . The site question second measurement record allow assessment repeatability recording . Therefore , 2 probe pass 4 measurement would obtain 2 manual 2 electronic reading .</detailed_description>
