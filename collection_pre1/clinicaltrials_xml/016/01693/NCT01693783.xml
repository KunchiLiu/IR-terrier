	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Human Papilloma Virus-Related Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety ipilimumab eligible patient recurrent metastatic cervical cancer . II . To assess antitumor activity ipilimumab eligible patient recurrent metastatic cervical cancer via assessment objective response rate ( ORR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity ipilimumab secondary endpoint include disease stabilization progression free survival ( PFS ) . II . Assessment antitumor activity ipilimumab use immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) III . Assessment predictive value baseline C-reactive protein . IV . Assess biologic response exposure ipilimumab via correlative study involve analysis lymphocyte subset assessment cervical cancer-antigen specific T cell anti-tumor response . V. Evaluation archival tissue regard marker immune population correlation clinical stage response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve objective response stable disease continue receive maintenance therapy comprise ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
