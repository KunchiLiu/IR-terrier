	<brief_summary>Researchers Orthopaedic surgery department LSU Medical Center-Shreveport hope learn pattern blood-flow around incision site patient undergoing surgery heel-bone fracture help predict whether complication arise specific type operation.The goal research study effectively answer many follow research question possible : 1 . Can drug normally use evaluate adequate blood flow plastic surgery tissue transfer use identify altered pattern blood flow operative site Calcaneus fracture , compare uninjured extremity ? 2 . Are change blood flow identifiable operative site post operatively ? 3 . Are certain pattern blood flow present preoperatively postoperatively predict wound complication ? 4 . Can certain pattern blood flow predict location slough dehiscence surgery ? 5 . Does incision site proximity specific pattern blood flow possibly predict wound complication ? The hypothesis study drug show correlation certain pattern blood flow whatever post-operative complication may arise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fractures calcaneus comprise 2 % adult fracture . These fracture make 60 % tarsal injury , majority close , displace intra-articular fracture . Despite injury 's prevalence , dispute appropriate method treatment remain ongoing . Several study show open , surgical approach superior either non-surgical percutaneous approach regard restore proper alignment structure hindfoot , depend severity displacement , provide certain patient condition preclude surgery . Adequately restore hindfoot structure paramount good clinical outcome ; proper alignment integral fully recover physiological functionality , also prevent complication subtalar arthritis present commonly malunited calcaneal fracture . Though literature may show open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) technique provide good long term outcome severely displace intra-articular fracture , proponent non surgical percutaneous approach argue superiority outcome may mitigate fact open surgical procedure laden post operatively numerous wound complication . These complication include , limited , deep superficial infection result slough , dehiscence , necrosis , erythema around surgical site . Managing infection surround soft tissue vasculature calcaneus follow operative treatment indeed seem present great challenge treat physician , wound heal complication present 2-25 % case . A necessity surgical wound repair adequately vascularized tissue , difficult come closure wound due undermine displacement soft tissue surgery . Sufficiently perfuse soft tissue also difficult differentiate tissue inadequately vascular base traditional clinical criterion color , warmth , dermal bleeding . The degree avascularity depend many factor relate patient , necessitate study conduct identify factor place prospective patient high risk develop wound heal problem post operatively . Studies nature thus far noted factor age , sex , height , weight , Bohler 's angle , tobacco usage , pre-existing condition diabetes , vascular disease , immune deficiency may indicative increase likelihood develop post surgical complication . Another risk factor particular interest timing surgery incidence injury . Current literature regard treatment hindfoot injury show moderate degree uniformity , advocate delay operative measure soft tissue swell around injury time subside : window approximately 7-14 day injury . Additionally , investigation Bohler 's angle predictor wound heal complication , Shuler colleague note pre post operative Bohler 's angle differential significant predictor develop infection , postulate increase heel height surgery may concomitantly increase soft tissue tension substantially enough disrupt proper blood supply surgical site healing . These finding lend tremendous support idea blood perfusion soft tissue play significant role predict wound heal complication . However , knowledge , use angiography correlate pre post operative soft tissue perfusion pattern post operative complication patient undergo ORIF fracture calcanei never investigate . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) angiography utilized myriad field medicine evaluate perfusion different tissue . It use cardiac surgery asses bypass patency , microsurgery assist free tissue transfer , plastic surgery ass area future necrosis mastectomy operation . Recently , ICG angiography use general surgery detect ischemic tissue aid surgeon determine appropriate extent debridement necessary prior wound closure laparotomy procedure . Though utility discipline medicine currently develop understood , implication ICG angiography orthopaedic surgery go unrecognized . We postulate soft-tissue perfusion pattern elucidate ICG angiography heel patient incurred calcaneal fracture may predictive wound heal complication develop surgery . This information could allow surgeon greatly reduce complication rate open reduction procedure calcaneus fracture early utilization appropriate , patient specific prophylactic measure , could provide additional contraindication operation patient otherwise aware elevate risk .</detailed_description>
