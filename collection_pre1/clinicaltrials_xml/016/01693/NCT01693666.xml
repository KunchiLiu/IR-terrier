	<brief_summary>Gaining much weight pregnancy associate adverse pregnancy complication long-term impact maternal offspring health , include increase risk obesity metabolic disease . Preventing excessive gestational weight gain could reduce adverse pregnancy outcome improve long-term health mother offspring . Thirty obese ( BMI ≥30 ) pregnant woman recruit pilot study randomly assign Lifestyle Intervention ForEver ( LIFE ) program routine care ( RC ) . Participants enrol 18 week gestation follow 12 week delivery . Women LIFE program give guidance healthy eating exercise regularly schedule obstetric visit . To increase adherence program , contingency management ( CM ) intervention offer incentive use establish maintain healthy nutrition physical activity habit , work towards goal restrict weight gain ( ± 10lb ) pregnancy . Three study test visit schedule participant : study entry , 34-36 week gestation , 12 week deliver . Primary outcome include adherence LIFE program , weight change pregnancy postpartum , objective measure maternal offspring health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Intervention Forever : Healthy Weight Pregnancy Birth ( Pilot Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal research examine impact healthy lifestyle intervention , target weight gain restriction pregnancy obese woman ( BMI≥30kg/m2 ) , maternal fetal outcome . The overarching research program 3 main objective : 1 . To establish effective contingency management behavioral program ( LIFE ) , increase adherence nutritional recommendation exercise guideline pregnancy . 2 . To examine impact LIFE program weight gain restriction pregnancy postpartum weight loss obese woman comparison RC group . 3 . To examine impact LIFE program short- long-term maternal offspring outcome study enrollment , 34-36 week gestation 3 month postpartum obese woman comparison RC group . - Maternal Outcomes : body composition ; peak aerobic capacity ; maternal hormonal/metabolic profile ( fast blood sample ) ; obstetric parameter ( incidence GDM , preeclampsia , cesarean delivery , obstetric trauma neonatal complication ) - Offspring Outcomes : fetal growth pattern ( fetal ultrasound ) ; neonatal anthropometry assess ≤ 48 h birth ( crown-heel length , weight , head , chest waist circumference , skinfold analysis ) ; metabolic marker birth ( cord blood ) ; infant anthropometry 12 week age ( ) . The experimental hypothesis test participation LIFE intervention obese pregnant woman prevent excessive weight gain and/or achieve weight maintenance ( ± 10 lb ) pregnancy result 7-10 % weight loss 12 week postpartum . Secondly , hypothesize participation LIFE intervention obese pregnant woman associate improved aerobic capacity , reduce incidence obstetric complication reduce rate LGA result beneficial alteration metabolic intrauterine environment fetal growth . With regard IRB application , conduct pilot feasibility trial address follow specific aim : 1 . To establish feasibility LIFE program large-scale fund project , include participant engagement intervention study visit . 2 . To evaluate feasibility LIFE program achieve weight maintenance postpartum weight loss target obese pregnant woman across three obesity class . 3 . To develop refine study material LIFE program assessment battery .</detailed_description>
