	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance guide Focused Ultrasound ( MRgFUS ) demonstrate effective pain control thermally-induced cell death periosteal denervation cause cortical heating relative acoustic energy absorption . There also evidence high intensity focus ultrasound beam penetrate cortical bone medullary space , produce thermal necrosis cancer tissue . However , little know potential effect MRgFUS first line therapeutic modality pain palliation skeletal metastasis . Our hypothesis seek assess clinical performance MRgFUS primary treatment painful bone metastasis determine potential technique local tumor control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unlike previous study , patient enrol MRgFUS treatment failure therapy , study conduct patient previously treat EBRT targeted lesion . This important new feature , especially give advantage MRgFUS , lack ionizing radiation , ability conduct treatment outpatient basis possibility repeat treatment necessary .</detailed_description>
