	<brief_title>Mid-HDF Randomized Controlled Study Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It matter fact last decade Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) population widely change . In Italy , example , 50 % incident dialysis patient 70 year old , diabetic hypertension major underlying disease ; moreover great percentage patient start dialysis burden least 1-2 comorbidities [ 1 ] . Online hemodiafiltration ( online HDF ) recently associate well patient survival comparison standard hemodialysis two large trial [ 2,3 ] ; overall relative risk mortality find approximately 33 % low patient treat online HDF [ 2,3 ] . These impressive result obtain anyway whole population , sub-group analysis . A strong correlation find total convective volume obtain mortality risk reduction ; HDF find significantly well standard hemodialysis total convective volume 19-22 L/session ( 4 hour session post-dilution HDF ) achieve . These result support importance `` adequate convective dose '' concept order improve patient outcome especially frail patient , recently demonstrate large randomise control trial , MPO study [ 4 ] , compare High Flux versus Low Flux dialysis patient plasma albumin level equal less 4 gr/dl ( marker patient comorbidities ) , post hoc analysis , diabetic patient [ 4 ] . Mid-dilution HDF variant classical HDF combine simultaneous pre- post.-dilution order maximise middle large solute removal . The MILESTONE study would aim fully demonstrate mid-dilution HDF significant mortality risk reduction observe recent mentioned study .</detailed_description>
