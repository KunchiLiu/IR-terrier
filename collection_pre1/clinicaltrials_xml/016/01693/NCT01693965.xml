	<brief_summary>Bronchopulmonary infection common serious complication evolutionary course cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Administration antibiotic adapt infect pathogen one key issue management . However , half patient CF chronic respiratory infection infectious agent remain unknown lead empirical antibiotic therapy adapt causative agent . Recently , new technology apply description characterization microbial agent CF patient include molecular biology technique allow u detect identify new and/or emerge pathogen . Moreover , sophisticated molecular technique pyrosequencing PCR amplification clone lead u demonstrate huge microbial diversity associate chronic bronchopulmonary infection population . Otherwise , metagenomic approach reveal extraordinary complexity respiratory flora patient , somewhat unexpected , abundance anaerobe , virus , bacteriophage . In addition , show antibiotic commonly use clinical practice treatment respiratory infection able induce bacteriophage , suggest existence lateral gene transfer transduction . The human microbiome set microbial community associate human body represent live microorganism body . Its role immunity development recently demonstrate suggesting change ecosystem play critical role evolution several human disease . For example , obesity show relationship intestinal human microbiota nutritional metabolic status host specific alteration intestinal microbiota may represent metagenomic signature disease . Evolution respiratory microbiota patient cystic fibrosis , whose nutritional status often impair ( chronic malnutrition due disorder digestive absorption ) receive regular antibiotic treatment remain unknown date . Characterization ecosystem role critical step understand evolutionary course disease . The main objective seminal study describe characterize respiratory microbiota sputum sample obtain limited number select patient CF 5 regional care center ( CRCM ) South France ( Mucomed network ) ( 2 patient per center : 6 adult 4 child ) , similar clinical , microbiological functional status cure antibiotic . Different microbiological tool use include axenic culture system , co-culture amoeba order isolate identify microbial community . Identification bacteria do use MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and/or molecular technique . Moreover , 16S rRNA PCR amplification follow clone sequence PCR product sputum sample carry identify compare bacterial specie identify use molecular method . In second step , respiratory microbiota characterize , interest develop dedicate microarray allow detect bacteria identify first stage project assess relevance large cohort patient CF study correlation respiratory microbiota clinical status patient accord prescribed antibiotic treatment . This study open new clinical perspective help u determine potential role antibiotic microbiota evolution treatment accord regional health care practice . This contribute well understand role microbiota evolution chronic respiratory infection . It could first step innovative therapeutic strategy , take account balance complex microbial flora possibly evolve accord antibiotic therapy . It could also form part large preventive strategy transmission specific pathogens CF .</brief_summary>
