	<brief_title>A Study Compare Ultrasound-guided Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block ( FICB ) Surgeon-placed Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block Post-operative Pain Control Patients Undergoing Anterior Hip Replacement Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Though still uncommonly use United States , popularity anterior approach total hip replacement rapidly grow clinical advantage . Rehabilitation simplify accelerate , dislocation risk reduce , leg length accurately control , incision small traditional approach ( GOEBEL ) . Nevertheless , although pain lessen , still considerable , new technique develop improve postoperative pain control procedure . Surgical incision tissue trauma result postoperative pain . Regional pain block , especially do ultrasound guidance , proven extremely effective reduce postoperative pain improve patient satisfaction . One block , fascia iliaca compartment block ( FICB ) , show effective control pain associate surgery involve hip femur . Although possible without ultrasound guidance , use technique allow identification specific tissue plane precise placement medication near nerve responsible postoperative pain . Using ultrasound , superficial fascial layer iliopsoas muscle identify anterior edge ilium , needle place beneath fascia . A high volume local anesthetic inject ultrasound guidance , ensure cephalad spread medication , attempt provide anesthesia lateral femoral cutaneous , femoral obturator nerve . Unlike approach hip replacement , anterior repair allow direct visualization fascial layer describe . This allow direct injection local anesthetic beneath fascia , potentially obviate need preoperatively perform , ultrasound guide , FICB . The primary difference approach ( ultrasound guide preop versus direct visualization intraop ) timing injection , unclear nerve block prior tissue damage affect postoperative pain patient . Surgical trauma cause nerve sensitization lead amplification prolongation postoperative pain . In experimental study , pre-injury neural blockade use local anesthetic show reduce post-injury sensitization central nervous system , similar technique apply injury le effect ( FILOS ) . Investigators therefore design study examine time FICB ( pre-operatively versus intra-operatively ) postoperative pain patient undergo anterior hip replacement surgery .</detailed_description>
