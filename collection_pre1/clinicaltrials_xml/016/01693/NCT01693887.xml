	<detailed_description>multicenter study ( total 2411 person-time ) find In United States 205 , antifungal therapy empirical therapy , preemptive therapy , target therapy respectively 44 % , 43 % , 12 % . While exist preemptive therapy empiric treatment comparative study show , survival rate patient without difference , cost application antifungal drug relatively empirical therapy . These finding difference , due different research forecast model , treatment option vary widely , without prospective multicenter study verification . Initiation antifungal therapy time antifungal drug choice affect many factor , include risk stratification patient , clinical manifestation , bacterial infection evidence non interventional diagnosis method result . How grasp opportunity treat fungal infection empirical therapy preemptive therapy plague global clinical doctor . The purpose study aim large scale prospective , multicenter study method China , severe invasive pulmonary fungal infection empiric treatment preemptive therapy clinical contrast research , exploration fungal treatment time plan , establish China 's optimal antifungal treatment option , reduce patient severe fungal infection harm increase rate successful treatment evidence-based medical evidence .</detailed_description>
