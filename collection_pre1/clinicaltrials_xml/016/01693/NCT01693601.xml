	<brief_title>Panobinostat Ruxolitinib In MyElofibrosis ( PRIME Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I/II open label , single institution , combination therapy trial induction Ruxolitinib follow combination Panobinostat dose escalation cohort primary endpoint determine safety tolerability combination therapy patient myelofibrosis ( MF ) chronic accelerate phase . A 3+3standard dose escalation scheme employ occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) capture occurrence event determine dose cohort escalation predetermine establish rule . In addition establish DLTs , maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) phase I portion trial , exploratory biomarkers evaluate within phase I well . Pharmacodynamics exploratory genetic epigenetic biomarkers explore predictor response therapy . The RPTD cohort expand incorporate total 22 patient , include 6 phase I , order assess clinical response assess International Working Group Myelofibrosis Research Treatment ( IWG-MRT ) primary endpoint phase II portion trial .</detailed_description>
