	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate performance Dynamic Locking Screws ( DLS ) use stabilize shaft component distal femur fracture comparison standard lock screw ( SLS ) . The hypothesis DLS lead well functional outcome ( WOMAC score ) due increase symmetrical callus formation few non-unions .</brief_summary>
