	<brief_summary>Research question : Pilot study research question : Primary : 1 ) Can recruit sufficient number ( i.e. , least 60 patient 9 month ) retain sufficient proportion men woman ( i.e. , least 80 % 2 , 4 , 6 month post-randomization ) advance cancer 3 trial arm allow completion full study 4 year ? ; 2 ) Is MMi acceptable : general ACP ? men woman ? ; Secondary : 1 ) Is feasible complete intervention 3-4 week ? 2 ) How long feasible test MMi effect : 2 , 4 6 month post-randomization ( retention rate=80 % ) ? 3 ) Which recruitment strategy helpful ? 4 ) What sample size need full study ? Full-study research question : Primary : Does add MMi usual care ( experimental group EG ) enhance mean life among newly diagnose ACP , compare receive usual care plus meeting empathic non-professional visitor ( i.e. , attention-control group AC ) usual care alone ( UC ) , x month post-randomization ? ( time determine pilot ) `` Meaning life '' ( primary outcome ) define belief one 's life significance purpose ( i.e. , global meaning ) `` newly diagnose ACP '' define 6 month first occurrence , progression toward , recurrence stage III IV cancer ( TNM classification system ) . Secondary : In future full-study , plan evaluate MMi effect secondary outcome existential wellbeing ( MQOL existential wellbeing ) posttraumatic growth ( Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory ) . We also plan test theoretical model sense mean life protective ( moderate ) effect tertiary outcomes physical QoL ( MQOL physical subscale ) , anxiety depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ) , overall QoL ( MQOL Total ) EG patient . Methodology : RCT pilot study 60 newly diagnose ACP ( stage III IV ) within 2 month referral 6 month randomization , assign randomly : ( 1 ) EG , ( 2 ) AC , ( 3 ) UC . Patients complete self-report questionnaire ( include outcome measure , well sociodemographic medical variable ) 2 , 4 6 month post-randomization .</brief_summary>
