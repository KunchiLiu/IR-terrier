	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Axitinib Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer Unsuitable Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A-PREDICT single arm , single agent , open label , multicentre , phase II study axitinib patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma predominant clear cell histology unsuitable debulking nephrectomy ( judged treat clinician ) . Patients provide consent satisfied eligibility criterion register trial . The start dose axitinib 5 mg twice daily mouth , escalate maximum 10mg twice daily mouth accord tolerability treatment , long patient derive clinical benefit . Treatment pause one week prior percutaneous biopsy primary day 1 week 9 . Disease progression evaluate accord RECIST v1.1 criterion 8 week commence treatment , 8 weekly interval 6 month 3 monthly thereafter . Blood tumour tissue sample take prior therapy evaluate biomarkers treatment response . Nephrectomy carry patient becomes suitable opinion treat clinician course trial . Where possible , tissue sample take resected specimen . Response axitinib marker lesion correlate change biomarkers .</detailed_description>
