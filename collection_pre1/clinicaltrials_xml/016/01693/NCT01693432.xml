	<brief_title>Docetaxel S-1 Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer ninth common cancer male population Korea . It estimate 1,864 new case esophageal cancer report 1,434 death occur Korea 2005 . Although half patient esophageal cancer initially present locoregional disease amenable radical surgery radiation-based therapy , patient eventually develop metastatic disease without local recurrence . Chemotherapy play major role palliative therapy remain primary mode treatment recurrent metastatic esophageal cancer . Although various chemotherapy regimens available , esophageal cancer carry poor prognosis , mean survival time le 8.1 month current chemotherapy use singly combination 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , vindesine , mitomycin , docetaxel , paclitaxel , cisplatin , irinotecan , vinorelbine , capecitabine . The majority trial perform small number patient report response rate 15 40 % . The response usually short duration survival benefit single agent chemotherapy . Combination chemotherapy slightly improve result term duration response ( 3-6 month ) , still little improvement overall survival . Therefore , identification new active agent essential prolong survival . Clinical trial single agent docetaxel report patient esophageal cancer response rate 18-25 % . S-1 , new biochemical modulator 5-FU , oral dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) inhibitory fluoropyrimidine . The advantage S-1 compare 5-FU great convenience oral formulation continuous delivery , without intravenous infusion . S-1 frequently use substitute 5-FU gastric cancer , limit data available esophageal cancer . The combination docetaxel S-1 highly active well tolerate advanced recurrent gastric cancer , synergistic antitumor activity fully elucidate . Therefore , evaluate efficacy docetaxel S-1 combination chemotherapy Korean patient esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
