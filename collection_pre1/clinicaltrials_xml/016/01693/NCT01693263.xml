	<brief_summary>Dialysis access , connection allow blood flow body dialysis session , important remove waste excess fluid patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . One method use access vein artery dialysis call brachiocephalic fistula . Patients ask participate study endstage renal disease , doctor recommend brachiocephalic fistula place dialysis access . A common problem see patient brachiocephalic fistula ( BCF ) cephalic arch stenosis ( CAS ) . CAS narrowing central vein ( locate upper chest ) . CAS cause problem open vein artery need dialysis . Once someone suffers CAS may need several radiology procedure well surgery help correct problem . The BCF may fail CAS develops . The purpose research study gather information BCF happen inside vein . The researcher hope find may cause CAS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome BCF Access Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHOD Subject Population : Subjects consideration study refer out-patient nephrology clinic University Chicago dialysis unit affiliate DaVita Dialysis primary AVF . Eligible patient evaluate University Chicago transplant vascular surgeon . If treat surgeon determines patient attempt BCF , patient eligible participate study . The research team notify potential subject . Clinical Protocol : After patient enrol , pre-operative labs work-up discretion surgeon . At time OR , BCF place , labs drawn viscosity , hematocrit , ADMA . If determined time treat surgeon subject suitable surgical candidate fistula due underlie medical condition , subject withdrawn study . A venogram Doppler cephalic arch obtain prior anastomosis creation . A segment cephalic vein arterial tissue collect excised amount send Human Tissue Research Center preserve future assay histology , cytokine , growth factor discuss . The serum specimens viscosity , Hct , ADMA transport ice IIT assay . The patient follow Doppler , venogram , associate test accord procedure follow schedule provide table \ref { protocol } large-scale prospective study . The clinically obtain measurement geometry , flow rate , whole blood viscosity use input CFD model use compute WSS HDP throughout arch . Patients develop symptoms stenosis protocol measurement venogram performed time diagnosis . These venogram consider standard care , although data may use study analysis . In addition , excise tissue sample cephalic vein arterial tissue obtain access place surgical revision bank future study . A subset ten subject large-scale study invite sub study involve : 1 ) detail three-dimensional imaging cephalic arch use IVUS , 2 ) blood flow monitoring via Doppler dialysis . Subjects undergone previous dialysis treatment invited participate optional sub-study . Participation sub-study affect participation main study . The IVUS image provide three-dimensional image vessel geometry remodel characteristic vein upon remodel index ( RI ) compute [ 26,27 ] . Detailed CFD model carry cephalic arch reconstruction , perform 0 24 month fistula insertion . This allow detail prospective study evolution IH , remodel , stenosis cephalic arch . For ten subject small-scale study , actual venous blood flow measure hemodialysis treatment use hand hold Doppler device upper arm cephalic vein close cephalic arch inlet possible . The Doppler reading obtain dialyzer blood flow 300 , 350 , 400 450 mL/minute . Three measurement obtain four blood flow , average blood flow calculate . These reading take 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month fistula insertion . The Doppler data obtain hemodialysis use along recent clinical venogram laboratory data outline perform CFD modeling . This data dialysis treatment use 1 ) quantify difference HDP subject pre-dialysis dialysis , 2 ) seek correlation Doppler read various dialyzer flow rate onset CAS . It expect formation stenosis would alter resistance blood flow arch , thereby alter flow rate way unique signature apparent Doppler data control dialysis process . If case , additional surveillance technique could develop identify onset CAS . History Physical : The history physical focus dialysis access . The history include type problem cannulation , pain score cannulation , needle size use , bleed complication . The physical exam include extensive examination access include pulse , description anastomosis , evidence aneurism , hematoma , inflammation , edema , swell head neck . Venogram : The venogram perform follow simultaneous blood flow measurement . The patient fistula puncture 21-gauge needle near arterial anastomosis direct toward stenosis ( either venous arterial ) . The needle exchange 5 French dilator , digital subtraction venogram encompass outflow puncture site right heart perform . Any stenosis measure use electronic caliper define . Any significant hemodynamic stenosis , define great 50 % narrowing expect luminal diameter , treat balloon angioplasty accord DOQI consensus International Society Interventional Radiology [ 36 ] . In addition baseline venogram time BCF placement , venogram include image anastomosis measurement length anastomosis inlet cephalic arch . Intravenous Ultrasound ( IVUS ) : The subset patient small-scale study venogram perform IVUS image Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory University Chicago . The IVUS catheter insert venogram , image take pullback catheter set rate order provide cross-sectional image intimal lumen layer vein preset interval along cephalic arch [ 26,40 ] . Doppler : Doppler spectral analysis perform interventional radiologist time venogram IVUS measure velocity cephalic vein prior enter cephalic arch . The peak systolic velocity ( PSV ) 60-degree angle insonation measure straight portion cephalic vein anastomosis arch close arch possible . The velocity location measure several heart cycle average calculate . Whole Blood Viscosity ( WBV ) , Hematocrit , ADMA : WBV , Hematocrit , ADMA measure serum sample obtain patient pre-op pre-dialysis . Blood sample anti-coagulated 3.2 % buffer sodium citrate transport ice IIT . At IIT , WBV measure use Brookfield Programmable DV-II+ cone plate viscometer . ADMA measure use ADMA ELISA kit EUROIMU US HPLC . The sample collect every 6 month subject frozen run aliquots 50 IIT . Cephalic Vein Arterial Tissue Samples : During placement BCF vein arterial tissue excise anastomosis create fistula . After tissue remove vein artery small portion remove collect research discard material . The cephalic vein arterial sample collect preserved tissue bank later review light electron microscopy subsequent study . The section review pathologist : generalize wall thickness , fibrous tissue infiltration , intimal hyperplasia , loss endothelial cell layer , disruption internal elastic lamina , mural calcification , inflammatory reaction wall infiltration erythrocytes and/or histiocycyte . The change present correlate development intimal hyperplasia evident CAS . Our hypothesis histiopathic change intimal hyperplasia baseline correlate development accelerate course develop CAS subsequent thrombosis . End-Point : The end-point subject 's enrollment study occur develop CAS great 50 % , transfer DaVita dialysis program , transplantation , death .</detailed_description>
