	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity critical global public health concern . Breastfeeding ideal choice infant nutrition . However , rapid excess weight gain infancy predict later , even among breastfed infant . This risk high mother obese and/or diabetic . Composition bioactive component breast milk may differ base mother normal weight ( NW ) , overweight , diabetes . Obesity Type 2 Diabetes associate overall increase inflammation oxidative stress , breast milk composition affect remains unknown . Our overarch goal determine maternal obesity Type 2 Diabetes impact human breast milk composition difference composition may impact infant growth fat development . We undertake study follow 20 Normal Weight , 20 Obese , 20 Gestational Diabetic , 20 Type 2 Diabetic mother infant first 4 month life . We track infant weight fat gain monitor maternal glucose control . We also collect breast milk sample first 4 month measure concentration growth appetite hormone , cytokine , marker oxidative stress nutrient composition milk . We predict concentration growth-regulatory hormone ( insulin leptin ) addition inflammatory cytokine marker oxidative stress low breast milk NW mother , high breast milk obese gestational diabetic mother , high Type 2 Diabetic mother ' breast milk . We expect difference pronounce first 2 week birth . We also predict breast milk concentration biomarkers associate infant fat gain . What find help u understand early infant nutrition growth may affect child 's late risk obesity .</brief_summary>
