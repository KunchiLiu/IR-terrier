	<brief_title>Disinvestment Study Population-Based Vision Screening Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia ( prevalence 3 - 4 % ) preventable , unilateral loss vision young child , case cause strabismus ( squint ) unilateral hypermetropia ( need plus glass ) , . The sensitive period vision loss develop recover , cover good eye patch , 6 year age . Population-based program child vision screen exist Sweden , United Kingdom , Canada , eastern European country Netherlands . Measurement visual acuity age four ( preschool ) common . In country , include Canada Netherlands , preverbal screen visual function infant young child ( age 0 - 2 ) add screen program . In Netherlands , apply regular visit age 1-2 , 3-4 , 6-9 , 14-24 month . At age 36 month , monocular visual acuity test picture chart . At age 45 60 month , monocular visual acuity measure Landolt-C chart . In 1996 , investigator start follow-up study birth cohort Rotterdam ( RAMSES ) determine sensitivity , specificity effectiveness screen program . A diagnosis amblyopia make 100 ( 3.4 % ) 2,964 child cause refractive error ( 42 ) , strabismus ( 19 ) , combine ( 30 ) deprivation ( 7 ) . It find case amblyopia detect vision screen measurement visual acuity age 3 year onwards . Preverbal screening enable early detection strabismus amblyopia , refractive amblyopia . The investigator therefore propose disinvestment study vision screening , omission screen age 6-9 14-24 month . First , optimal screening interval calculate newly develop micro-simulation model effectiveness repeat screening , basis data obtain RAMSES study . The model simulation predict screening age 6-9 14-24 month omit without appreciable loss number detect amblyopia case . This tested RCT among two large youth health care organisation , ICARE ( 12,500 new child annually ) GGD-Amsterdam . Two large birth-cohorts recruit . Children bear July December 2011 form control group examine 6-9 , 14-24 , 36 45 month . Children born January June 2012 intervention group . These child examine 36 45 month . Endpoint number case amblyopia detect , weight visual acuity , age detection . The question whether significant difference group find cumulative number case amblyopia detect age 4 year . The new model optimise screen interval develop course study generic tool determine optimal screening interval screen program repeat exams young child ultimately allow comparison effectiveness population-based screening program different disorder different country , carry different personnel . Finally , RAMSES study 23 % child screen positively refer successfully ophthalmologist orthoptist ; 43 % parent low moderate fluency Dutch language . This reflect lack utilisation among immigrant preventive screen falter transit prevention care . Unsuccessful referral , relation parental fluency Dutch , ethnicity SES , hence , monitor study exploratory fashion .</detailed_description>
