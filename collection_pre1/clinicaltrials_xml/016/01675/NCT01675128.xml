	<brief_summary>Background : - Irinotecan drug use treat colon rectal cancer . It affect deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) grow cancer cell . It often use chemotherapy drug . Researchers want test experimental drug , ISIS 183750 . They want see drug safe effective treatment advance solid tumor colorectal cancer respond treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness ISIS 183750 irinotecan advance solid tumor colorectal cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor colorectal cancer respond treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample also collect . Tumor tissue sample may collect well treatment . Imaging study also perform . - Participants take ISIS 183750 week 28-day cycle treatment . On first cycle , also ISIS 183750 day 3 5 . - Participants take irinotecan every second week , begin day 15 first cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Treatment continue long cancer grow side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ISIS 183750 With Irinotecan Advanced Solid Tumors Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The eukaryotic translation initiation factor - eIF4E - potent oncogene find dysregulated approximately 30 % human cancer . Upregulation eIF4E early event colorectal cancer ( CRC ) correlate CRC progression . ISIS 183750 second-generation antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO ) design inhibit production human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) protein . Objectives : Primary : To establish Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) establish safety combination ISIS 183750 irinotecan advance solid tumor . Secondary : - To evaluate Response Rate , Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , Overall Survival ( OS ) combination ISIS 183750 irinotecan advance irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer . - To perform correlative study evaluate effect eIF4E inhibition relevant regulate protein immune cell . - To characterize plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter ISIS 183750 absence presence irinotecan - To characterize plasma PK parameter irinotecan presence ISIS 183750 Eligibility : -Adult patient irinotecan-resistant colorectal cancer ( advanced solid tumor phase I part ) . Design : - This single-arm phase I/II study whereby patient receive combination ISIS 183750 irinotecan . All cycle 28 day . - Cycle 1 : ISIS 183750 administer intravenously Cycle 1 Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 15 22 . - Cycle 2 beyond : ISIS 183750 administer intravenous infusion every week without break , i.e . Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle . Patients re-staged every 8 week . - Irinotecan administer dose 160mg/m^2 intravenous infusion every second week commence Day 15 Cycle 1 . The primary endpoint study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination ISIS 183750 irinotecan advance solid tumor . The phase II portion study confine irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer . Irinotecan-refractory defined patient radiological evidence disease progression whilst receive irinotecan within 3 month complete . - Correlative study comprise : Mandatory pre- post- dose biopsy eIF4e messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein ( IHC ) analysis perform phase II portion study ; Immune subset ; positron emission tomography ( PET ) responses ( expansion cohort ) ; Pharmacokinetic data regard interaction irinotecan ISIS183750 10-12 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Phase I : Patients must histopathological confirmation carcinoma Laboratory Pathology National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) prior enter study . Phase II : Patients must histopathological confirmation Colorectal Carcinoma ( CRC ) Laboratory Pathology NCI prior enter study . For portion study patient must also irinotecanrefractory colorectal cancer also receive prior treatment advanced/metastatic disease oxaliplatin , bevacizumab , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitorcontaining ( subject wild type Kras ) regimen . Irinotecanrefractory define patient radiological evidence disease progression whilst receive irinotecan within 3 month complete . Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection ablative technique receive least one prior standard chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic disease . All patient enrol require measurable disease . For phase II portion study patient must disease amenable biopsy willing undergo . Age great than18 year Life expectancy great 3 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must acceptable organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin Within normal institutional limit Serum albumin great equal 2.5 g/dL Patients eligible alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) measure 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) liver metastasis 5 x ULN liver metastasis . creatinine &lt; 1.5X institution upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 , calculate , patient creatinine level institutional normal Estimated creatinine clearance ( mL/min ) Females see calculation Males see calculation May use 24 hr . urine collection determine creatinine clearance . Measured creatinine clearance ( mL/min ) Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity &lt; grade 1 returned baseline . Patients must invasive malignancy within past 3 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix noninvasive bladder cancer successful curative treatment ) . The effect ISIS 183750 develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month dose study medication cease . However , adequate contraception male patient use 16 week post last dose due sperm life cycle . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry . Patient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Ejection fraction &gt; 55 % echocardiogram . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy ( socalled target systemic therapy ) , large field radiotherapy , major surgery must wait 4 week complete treatment prior enter study . Patients may receive antineoplastic drug intend treat cancer within 4 week prior start ISIS 183750 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients clinically significant ascites , pleural effusion , and/or peripheral edema , unless ascites pleural effusion occur result malignancy . Patients know hypersensitivity irinotecan . Patients know homozygous mutation UTG1A1 UUDPglucuronosyltransferase 11 ) allele , unknown UTG1A1 status could tolerate irinotecan even dose reduction . Patients bleed diathesis subject receive anticoagulation treatment International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) &gt; 2.5 exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 160 , diastolic BP &gt; 100 ) , ongoing active systemic infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive antiretroviral therapy exclude study due possibility pharmacokinetic interaction antiretroviral medication investigational agent . Known hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Pregnancy breast feeding exclusion factor . Enrolled patient must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 3 month end treatment .</criteria>
