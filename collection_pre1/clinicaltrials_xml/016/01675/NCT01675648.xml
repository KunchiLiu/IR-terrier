	<brief_summary>In Singapore , opiate substitution medication e.g . methadone license use specific population . The standard treatment one week detoxification assist diazepam symptomatic treatment follow one week rehabilitation . However , diazepam highly addictive widely abuse among heroin user pharmacologically , reduce physical psychological craving opioids trigger relapse . Many opiate patient undergoing inpatient detoxification leave prematurely ( i.e . PID : patient initiate discharge ) severity unpleasant withdrawal symptom . The purpose study establish alternative medication reduce opiate withdrawal symptom use Singapore evaluate clinical efficacy Lofexidine versus Diazepam management opiate withdrawal syndrome inpatient detoxification .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lofexidine Inpatient Opiate Detox Singapore</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This randomize , double-blind ( double-dummy design ) phase IV clinical trial . Patients receive 10 day Lofexidine plus Diazepam placebo Diazepam plus Lofexidine placebo . All patient expect complete 2-weeks inpatient detoxification programme NAMS ward . Up 122 patient ( 61 randomize arm ) enrol study ensure least 43 patient arm complete Day 4 study treatment programme . Efficacy Assessments : The primary efficacy outcome measure Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( OOWS ) score ( range = 0-13 ) Day 3 Day 4 treatment phase . The second efficacy outcome measure Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) , Opiate Craving visual analogue scale Pupil size Day 3 Day 4 , time dropout ( length stay ward ) emotional/psychological symptom measure every 3 day . Our expect study outcomes follow : - Significantly low mean score Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( OOWS ) day 3 4 detox among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm - Significantly low mean score Subjective experience opiate withdrawal scale ( SOWS ) day 3 4 detox among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm - Significantly large pupil size day 3 4 detox among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm - Significantly low mean crave score Visual Analogue Scale day 3 4 detox among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm - Significantly longer stay ( day ) ward among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm - Significantly low anxiety depression score MAP among patient lofexidine arm relative benzodiazepine arm Safety Assessment Monitoring : After sign informed consent , subject undergo screening assessment determine eligibility study enrollment ; screen test include FBC , LFT , Renal function 12-lead ECG , urine pregnancy test female . A complete physical examination perform first day screen . From Day 1 till discharge , Vital Signs ( e.g . pulse rate , body temperature , blood pressure respiratory rate ) closely monitor study nurse ward , i.e . immediately prior lofexidine dose addition , 2 hour first dose dose day . Should patient show sign hypotension , nurse inform investigator determine whether necessary terminate patient ' participation trial . Patients required repeat 12-lead ECG test complete study drop study . If significant find repeat ECG , follow investigator resolve . All adverse event document follow resolve study period . The Regular Study Safety Reports inclusive patient ' recruitment , AE/SAE generate periodically sent Independent Date &amp; Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) review , DSMC comprise addiction medicine expert outside IMH . Individual patient entire study discontinue major safety find . Sample Size Statistical method : The estimate 122 subject ( 61 per group ) sample size base follow assumption - mean ( SE ) OOWS score day 4 2.4 ( 0.4000 ) 3.9 ( 2.7713 ) lofexidine diazepam group respectively ( implies expect absolute treatment effect 1.5 ) , power 80 % , allow 30 % patient drop evaluation day 4 . Thirty percent dropout imply 86 subject ( 43 per group ) require evaluate benefit lofexidine diazepam . The primary efficacy analysis do use ITT dataset safety profile describe use safety dataset . All analysis conduct independent statistician ( SCRI ) .</detailed_description>
