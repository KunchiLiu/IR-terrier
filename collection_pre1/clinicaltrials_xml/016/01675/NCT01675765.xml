	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate safety immune response sequential administration cancer vaccine CRS-207 ( without cyclophosphamide ) follow standard care chemotherapy ( pemetrexed cisplatin ) . CRS-207 weaken ( attenuate ) form Listeria monocytogenes genetically-modified reduce capacity cause disease , maintain ability stimulate potent immune response . CRS-207 engineer elicit immune response tumor-associated antigen mesothelin , show present high level certain tumor cell ( mesothelioma ) normal cell . Pemetrexed cisplatin standard chemotherapy regimen treat malignant pleural mesothelioma . This trial evaluate whether give CRS-207 cancer vaccine chemotherapy induce anti-tumor immune response and/or objective tumor response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up 60 subject enrol study . Eligible subject receive 2 prime vaccination CRS-207 ( 1×10^9 colony-forming unit [ CFU ] give intravenously [ i.v . ] 2 hour ) ( without cyclophosphamide ) 2 week apart follow 2 week later 6 cycle pemetrexed cisplatin 21 day apart . Three week completion chemotherapy , subject receive additional 2 infusion ( boost vaccination ) CRS-207 3 week apart . Subjects follow every 8 week disease progression immune-related response criterion . Subjects continue meet dosing eligibility may receive additional CRS-207 ( without cyclophosphamide ) infusion ( maintenance vaccination ) follow-up visit . Study assessment include blood draw safety immune response monitoring CT scan [ optional fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) ] magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) monitor disease status . In addition , optional tumor biopsy may perform , treatment .</detailed_description>
