	<brief_title>A Study Assess Efficacy Safety Oxycodone/Naloxone Korean Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ( CIPN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , phase IV , interventional study ass efficacy safety Targin ( Oxycodone/Naloxone ) Korean patient CIPN ( Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ) need opioid combination treatment exist pregabalin last dose prior study enrollment without change . Upon provide write informed consent , subject screen study assessment perform time safety data ( adverse event ( AE ) /serious adverse event ( SAEs ) ) include laboratory result , physical examination , vital sign , medical history taking , 24 hour pain intensity score , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity ( FACT-GOG/NTX ) , physician 's overall satisfaction subject 's overall satisfaction . If patient eligible inclusion/exclusion criterion time visit 1 , patient receive treatment Targin . Re-screening , study drug dose interruption allow . The duration study drug dose interruption define 1 week . Treatment Targin start 10/5mg twice daily 4 week , proper titration ( up-titration ) allow visit accord investigator 's decision . Dose titration maximum Targin 40/20mg twice daily permit study period . The up-titration consider investigator 's judgement following ; ( 1 ) rescue medication use 2 time per day , average ( 2 ) base daily average Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) , NRS change worsen since previous visit , ( 3 ) Investigator 's judgement consider titration need situation ( e.g . dose , frequency rescue medication ) . Safety laboratory obtain baseline ( visit 1 ) study end ( visit 4 ) local laboratory . The laboratory value within 4 week prior baseline ( visit 1 ) allow use study visit 1 . The rescue medication 5mg ( Immediate release codon trade mark ) IRcodonTM . Patients withdraw study follow circumstance require study drug discontinuation : Failure pain control ( Failure pain control decide investigator judgement , e.g . poor pain control lack efficacy despite 2~3 time titration . ) Adjustment analgesic due AEs except Targin IRcodonTM Adjustment major pain management modality ( e.g . chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery , non-surgical interventional therapy , etc . ) Withdrawal inform consent Pregnancy Any significant risk patient 's safety clinical judgement investigator</detailed_description>
