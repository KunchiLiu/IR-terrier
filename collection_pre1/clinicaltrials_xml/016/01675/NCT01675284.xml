	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Evaluate Safety , Reactogenicity , Humoral Immune Responses Inactivated H5N1 Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1997 , avian H5N1 influenza Southeast Asia cause several human infection high mortality rate . Experts warn next influenza pandemic imminent could severe prevention control depend rapid production worldwide distribution specific pandemic influenza candidate vaccine . An H5N1 influenza vaccine successfully produce whole virus grow MDCK ( Madin-Darby canine kidney ) cell . These purify inactivated vaccine antigen safe could induce immune response animal study . Moreover , formulate aluminum phosphate strong response generate even low dos animal ( Chong et al. , 2008 ; Hu et al. , 2008 ) . However , investigation necessary human safety immunogenicity establish . This human phase I clinical study , therefore , evaluate safety immunogenicity adjuvanted H5N1 virion influenza vaccine .</detailed_description>
