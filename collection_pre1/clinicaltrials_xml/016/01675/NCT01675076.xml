	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best strategy manage novel oral anti-coagulants ( NOACs ) time pacemaker defibrillator surgery . The Investigators hypothesize perform device surgery without interruption novel oral anti-coagulant result reduce rate clinically significant hematoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strategy Continued Versus Interrupted Novel Oral Anti-coagulant Time Device Surgery Patients With Moderate High Risk Arterial Thromboembolic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , randomized trial , 1:1 randomization either continued NOAC interrupt NOAC patient non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation atrial flutter moderate high risk arterial thrombo-embolic event require device surgery . All patient study receive Dabigatran Rivaroxaban Apixaban least 5 day prior enrollment . The peri-operative management NOAC patient receive randomize Interrupted NOAC Continued NOAC . Interrupted NOAC arm : 1 . Interrupted Dabigatran - base renal function , patient discontinue Dabigatran 1 day surgery GFR &gt; 50 mL/min , 2 day surgery GFR 30-50 mL/min . - Dabigatran resume next regular dose time , &gt; = 24 hour end surgery . 2 . Interrupted Rivaroxaban - patient discontinue Rivaroxaban 1 full day surgery . - Rivaroxaban resume next regular dose time , &gt; = 24 hour end surgery . 3 . Interrupted Apixaban - patient discontinue Apixaban 1 full day surgery . - Apixaban resume next regular dose time , &gt; = 24 hour end surgery . Continued NOAC arm : -patients continue chronic dose Dabigatran Rivaroxaban Apixaban throughout . All patient baseline clinical lab test serum creatinine GRF measure . Patients see post-op day surgery assessment surgical site day throughout hospital stay blind member research team . A telephone follow-up do day 3-4 post surgery unblinded team member . All patient see 1-2 week post-op first routine post-op device clinic visit , surgical site assessment blind assessor complete Quality Life questionnaire . Patients see assessment case bleed development pocket swell hematoma . Patients develop hematoma follow resolution hematoma .</detailed_description>
