	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Several Doses Viaskin Peanut Adults Children With Peanut Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy common allergy United States , prevalence general population high 1 % . So far , approve treatment peanut allergy . Peanut allergy management base strict peanut avoidance injectable epinephrine allergic systemic reaction start . Specific Immunotherapy method currently available show limitation use safety issue . Hence , important unmet medical need efficient safe treatment peanut allergy . DBV Technologies develop epicutaneous delivery system , call Viaskin , method base deliver precise quantity allergen upper layer skin . Avoiding contact allergen bloodstream confer epicutaneous immunotherapy ( EPIT ) high level safety systemic reaction circumvent The VIPES study 12-month double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial study efficacy safety Viaskin Peanut subject 6 55 year old history immediate hypersensitive reaction peanut protein . The trial conduct site investigator staff train experience diagnosis management peanut allergy anaphylaxis , capable perform double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) adult and/or pediatric subject . Three dos peanut protein , i.e . 50 mcg , 100 mcg 250 mcg evaluate study . Following confirmation peanut allergy screening , subject randomized 1:1:1:1 ratio four different treatment group , include 50 mcg , 100 mcg 250 mcg peanut protein placebo . Treatment comprise daily application Viaskin Peanut placebo patch 12 month . Each subject undergo two DBPCFCs : one screen one Month 12 . A follow visit perform 2 week completion treatment last DBPCFC .</detailed_description>

Known allergy know hypersensitivity placebo excipients either Viaskin patch food challenge formula . Subjects react objectively placebo formula screening . Severe reaction screen food challenge , define need intubation , hypotension persist epinephrine administration , need two dos epinephrine . Inability discontinue shortacting antihistamine three day longacting antihistamine five seven day ( depend halflife ) prior skin prick test food challenge . Subjects treat systemic longacting corticosteroid ( depot corticosteroid ) within 12 week prior screen visit and/or systemic shortacting corticosteroid within 4 week prior screen visit systemic corticosteroid screening . Subjects asthma define follow : 1. uncontrolled persistent asthma National Asthma Education Prevention Program Asthma guideline ( 2007 ) Global Initiative Asthma ( 2011 ) treat combination therapy medium dose inhale corticosteroid long act inhaled β2agonists ; 2. least two systemic corticosteroid course asthma past year one oral corticosteroid course asthma past three month ; 3. prior intubation asthma past two year . Subjects βblocking agent , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor , angiotensinreceptor blocker , calcium channel blocker tricyclic antidepressant therapy . Subjects undergo type immunotherapy food within one year prior screen visit . Subjects presently aeroallergen immunotherapy unwilling unable discontinue . Subjects currently treat antitumor necrosis factor drug antiIgE drug ( omalizumab ) biologic immunomodulatory therapy within one year prior screen visit . Allergy known history reaction Tegaderm® . Subjects suffer generalized dermatologic disease ( e.g . severe atopic dermatitis , uncontrolled generalize eczema , keratosis pilaris , ichthyosis vulgaris ) intact skin zone apply patch .
