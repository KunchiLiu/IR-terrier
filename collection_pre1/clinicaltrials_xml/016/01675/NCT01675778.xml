	<detailed_description>Pain common complaint patient present emergency department ( ED ) . Morphine hydromorphone two commonly administrate intravenous opioid analgesic . However , large inter-individual variation response morphine hydromorphone observe significant number patient satisfactory pain relief receive commonly administer dos two medication . Current study focus investigate optimal strategy intravenous opioid use moderate severe pain ED . Contrary commonly recommend total body weight ( TBW ) base dose strategy , recent publication demonstrate linear relationship TBW clinical response morphine . The ultimate goal research identify optimal method dose opioids alleviate pain ED patient . The objective study examine association two measure body size/body composition response standard dose hydromorphone . The null hypothesis association measure body size/composition response 1 mg hydromorphone , thus difference association . If strong association exist TBW BMI pain response , lend support importance take body size composition account make decision hydromorphone dose ED . It lay groundwork future study analgesic dosing . This particular importance give increase prevalence obesity US develop nation . Specific Aims : 1 . To test association analgesic response standard dose hydromorphone total body weight ED patient acute pain require intravenous opioid analgesia . 2 . To test association analgesic response standard dose hydromorphone BMI . 3 . To compare association analgesic response standard dose hydromorphone two measure body size/composition , BMI TBW . 4 . To assess whether association response hydromorphone measure body size/composition confound modified gender , age , ethnicity certain genetic polymorphism . The result current study suggest whether body size composition play role clinical response hydromorphone may lay groundwork study determine whether dose modified take characteristic account either continuously , e.g . 0.015 mg/kg hydromorphone categorically ( increase dos category BMI ) .</detailed_description>
