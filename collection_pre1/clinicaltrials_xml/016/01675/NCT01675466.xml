	<brief_summary>Patients acute abdominal pain comprise significant proportion attendance emergency department . These patient account third general surgical admission typical day . In case , diagnosis clear baseline investigation ( example case pancreatitis ) . In case , diagnosis remain unclear sign necessitate urgent surgery ( example case appendicitis ) . A final group exist clear explanation pain find insufficient clinical sign warrant surgery . These patient say `` non specific abdominal pain '' ( NSAP ) present management dilemma . Traditionally patient manage strategy active observation . Patients examine regular interval may undergo image . In case , symptom sign progress surgery need case resolution may occur diagnosis may reach non-operatively allow focused medical treatment . Recently , two alternative strategy emerge . Early cross-sectional imaging use CT scanning may identify condition whilst non-invasive . This would allow diagnosis treatment would follow . The alternative strategy early laparoscopy ( key hole surgery ) offer possibility concomitant therapy , invasive . The study hypothesis patient acute non-specific abdominal pain active management laparoscopy admission reduce hospital stay cost compare traditional active observation , without increase complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Early Laparoscopy With Active Observation Acute Non-specific Abdominal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer general surgical service initially manage per routine practice . They assess member surgical house-staff , simple baseline investigation ( full blood count , serum amylase , C-reactive protein , plain radiography ) request . Patients review registrar consultant . At point , proportion patient clear indication surgery e.g . free gas erect chest x-ray peritonitis . A subgroup appropriately manage test out-patient basis patient allow home . Some patient clear diagnosis e.g . pancreatitis . Patients group manage accord usual practice responsible consultant surgeon . There final subgroup patient population interest trial . These patient clear diagnosis safe decision operate discharge possible . Such patient usually admitted period observation investigation intervention order clinical picture evolve . These patient randomly assign one two management option : active observation arm ( control ) early laparoscopy arm . Active Observation : Patients randomise group receive routine practice serve trial control group . They review regularly responsible surgical team . Further investigation intervention request discretion responsible team . Early laparoscopy : Patients randomise group list diagnostic laparoscopy emergency theatre . The aim undertake procedure within 12 hour randomisation . The procedure perform duty consultant surgeon / nominate deputy usual practice . Findings laparoscopy require surgical intervention e.g . appendicitis treat part procedure routine clinical practice . Follow-up : Each patient followed-up daily basis member trial team whilst in-patient . Complications , investigation intervention , unplanned critical care admission , death , length hospital stay final discharge diagnosis record . Following discharge , patient review four week six month . SF36 questionnaires complete visit . In addition , Hospital In-patient Episode database interrogate admission hospital within six month randomisation</detailed_description>
