	<brief_summary>1 . Protocol Summary Title : SHARP : Small Hyperplastic Adenomatous Reliability Protocol Purpose : To compare accuracy NBI-in vivo differentiation hyperplastic adenomatous &lt; 10 mm polyp histology European multi-center study . To assess variability among endoscopists NBI accuracy . We also aim assess whether technology impact appropriateness surveillance interval . Design : 1 ) Before start patient enrollment , participate endoscopists attend internet-based training program vivo differentiation hyperplastic adenomatous polyp . Following course , qualify examination require endoscopist include . 2 ) Patients schedule screen diagnostic colonoscopy consider inclusion . Patients least one histologically verify &lt; 10 mm polyp include . In order measure NBI feasibility , include polyp vivo assess NBI order rank high- low- level diagnostic confidence , thereafter send histological assessment . NBI- histological accuracy differentiate hyperplastic adenomatous lesion analyze compare , order assess NBI-sensitivity specificity . The primary outcome measure NBI feasibility accuracy study population , assess variability among endoscopists . Secondary outcome measure cost analysis much saving would achieve refer NBI-diagnosed hyperplastic polyp histology , clinical inference many patient would schedule inappropriate post-polypectomy follow , follow schedule base NBI classification . Clinical result analyze use various statistical measure significance . Clinical Site Locations : 10 European centre NBI-technology 1 NBI-expert endoscopist centre Enrollment : 160 small ( &lt; 10 mm ) polyps site Study technology : NBI-Olympus without optical magnification Risk : Non-interventional study .</brief_summary>
