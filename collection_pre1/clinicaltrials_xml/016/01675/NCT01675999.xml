	<brief_summary>In patient locally advanced colon cancer ( high risk stage II stage III ) , curative surgery follow adjuvant FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy become standard care . However , 30-40 % patient , current curative treatment strategy surgical excision follow adjuvant chemotherapy fail either clear locoregional spread eradicate distant micrometastases , lead disease recurrence . Preoperative chemotherapy attractive concept locally advanced colon cancer potential impact upon cause failure . Optimum systemic therapy early possible opportunity may effective eradicate distant metastasis treatment give delay immunological stress surgery . Added , shrink primary tumor surgery may reduce risk incomplete surgical excision , risk tumor cell shed surgery . ECKINOXE multicenter randomize phase II trial design evaluate efficacy ( response rate ) feasibility ( safety , tolerance ) two chemotherapy regimen ( FOLFOX-4 alone FOLFOX-4+Cetuximab ) neoadjuvant strategy patient locally advanced colon cancer . Control arm include patient standard treatment comprise surgery follow adjuvant FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy . This phase II study ass feasibility neoadjuvant strategy patient determine neoadjuvant regimen effective term response rate .</brief_summary>
