	<brief_title>Executive Function/Metacognitive Training At-Risk Preschoolers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruptive behavior disorder , particularly Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , constitute one common diagnose preschool child . Disruptive behavior major public health problem include cause significant emotional distress caregiver child , expulsion daycare early education setting , demand caregiver 's time , accident proneness safety concern . However , evidence-based early intervention exist preschooler attention behavior problem , critical strongly suggest first line treatment preschooler ADHD . Because executive functioning ( EF ) consistently propose putative factor development disruptive behavior disorder intervention target EF ( e.g. , inhibition , work memory ) , attention , metacognition early childhood could likely affect development disruptive behavior disorder preschooler . Indeed , EF skills identify kindergarten teacher primary prerequisite school success . EF deficits independently contribute poor outcome ADHD , link directly academic social function deficit . Given EF brain development rapidly develop preschool year , preschooler may benefit early intervention target EF skill . Investigators develop promise intervention , Executive Training Attention Metacognition ( ETAM ) , preschooler , conduct small preliminary open trial demonstrate initial acceptability intervention . Investigators also find significant moderate effect size objective measure EF moderate large effect size reduction rating inattention behavioral symptom parent , clinician , teacher . A randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) need investigate positive effect executive functioning , attention , behavior due ETAM effect parental attention and/or placebo effect . Investigators propose assess feasibility design future RCT . Investigators develop attention control ( AC ) comparison group assess feasibility : identifying , enrol retain preschooler at-risk ADHD , randomization choice , measurement EF functional outcome , delivery protocol AC ETAM conduct pilot RCT 60 child at-risk ADHD . Exploratory aim include assess whether child ETAM group show gain compare AC target ( train ) outcome ( i.e. , measure EF ) untrained outcome ( i.e. , ADHD symptom , academic readiness , social competence ) . Investigators also assess whether gain maintain well investigate potential moderators/mediators .</detailed_description>
