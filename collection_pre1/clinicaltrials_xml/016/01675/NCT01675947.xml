	<brief_summary>This study seek enroll 50 person central non-central geographic atrophy ( GA ) associate age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . GA treat eye must 0.75 disk area ( DA ) 8 DA . Eligible participant randomly choose receive one follow treatment study eye : 1 . A 20 μL ( 440 μg ) intravitreal ( IVT ) injection sirolimus , 2 . A sham treatment ( subconjunctival injection lidocaine ) Participants two ( 2 ) eligible eye one eye randomly assign receive intravitreal sirolimus sham fellow eye . The first injection begin Day 0 , may occur date screening/enrollment two week follow screening/enrollment visit , every month thereafter . The visit schedule follow : 1 . A clinical evaluation , include safety measure , occur monthly . 2 . Vision measure screening/enrollment visit 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month first injection occur . 3 . Fundus autofluorescence occur screening/enrollment 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month first injection occur . 4 . Fundus color photography optical coherence tomography occur screening/enrollment 6 , 12 , 18 24 month first injection occur . The primary goal evaluate whether person receive sirolimus injection show slow worsen geographic atrophy compare person receive sham injection . A secondary goal evaluate impact sirolimus vision compare sham . NOTE : As May 30 , 2014 , study injection discontinue due safety concern . No enrollment occur follow-up continue active study participant quarterly basis . That , visit coincide 3 month interval date enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 55 year age older . Prior participation AgeRelated Eye Disease Study 2 ( AREDS2 ) require . Participant must understand sign protocol 's informed consent document . Participant must central noncentral geographic atrophy ( GA ) least one eye . GA least 0.75 disk area ( DA ) size 8 disk area ( DA ) ; approximately 2.54 mm2 1 DA . GA define one welldefined , usually less circular patch partial complete depigmentation retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . Even much RPE appear preserve large choroidal vessel visible , round patch RPE partial depigmentation may still classify early GA . Participant must steady fixation study eye foveal parafoveal area medium clear enough good quality photograph . Participant must visual acuity 20/25 20/200 study eye . Female participant must postmenopausal . Male participant female partner capable conceive child require use contraception study four month last sirolimus injection . Participant another investigational study AREDS2 actively receive study therapy geographic atrophy choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . Participant evidence ocular disease AMD either eye may confound outcome study ( e.g. , glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy 10 hemorrhage microaneurysms , uveitis , pseudovitelliform macular degeneration , moderate/severe myopia ) . Participant receive treatment AMD , macular laser , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) antivascular endothelial growth factor ( antiVEGF ) therapy injection . Or participant receive IVT injection agent ( e.g. , triamcinolone ) antiVEGF agent within last four month prior study enrollment . Vitamin supplementation AMD consider exclusionary criterion . Participant vitrectomy . Participant expect need ocular surgery course trial . Participant undergone lens removal last three month Yttrium Aluminium Garnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy within last month . Participant chemotherapy . Participant immunosuppressive medication immunosuppressed . Participant ocular systemic medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve . Participant history malignancy would compromise 2year study survival . Participant history ocular herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . History cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past five year could worsen immunosuppression . ( The risk immunosuppression must determine oncology consultation prior enrollment . ) Ocular periocular inflammation infection either eye . Presence active inactive toxoplasmosis study eye .</criteria>
