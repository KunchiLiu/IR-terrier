	<brief_summary>Background : - Multiple myeloma rarely curable , treatable . Initial treatment direct control symptom reduce number myeloma cell . It continue cancer stop respond treatment . At time , treatment may switch maintenance therapy , give try extend response first therapy long possible . Research suggest lenalidomide maintenance therapy may delay time myeloma cell start grow possibly improve survival . - Lenalidomide drug may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Researchers want look long-term effect lenalidomide immune cell . It also look effect extend treatment cancer immune system . Objectives : - To test long-term effectiveness lenalidomide therapy multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age newly diagnose relapse multiple myeloma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . A bone scan bone marrow biopsy also perform . - Participants receive lenalidomide maintenance treatment . It give accord standard care multiple myeloma . Participants take lenalidomide every day 21 day repeat 28-day cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test . Blood test look effect treatment immune system . - Treatment continue long cancer worsen side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remain largely incurable disease estimate median survival 6-7 year standard risk myeloma 2-3 year high risk disease despite treatment autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . Maintenance therapy achieve sustain suppression residual disease follow chemotherapy ASCT long view desirable approach extend survival MM . Giving immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide induction re-induction treatment may stimulate immune system various way stop slow return cancer . It yet know immune stimulatory effect extend dose lenalidomide maintenance set correlate clinical benefit . Objectives : Assess T cell ( CD4 , CD8 ) , NKT NK cell number peripheral blood course lenalidomide maintenance therapy treat MM patient . Eligibility : Patients multiple myeloma achieve stable disease well response , assess great equal 4 week complete induction re-induction treatment Age great equal 18 year ECOG PS 0-2 Adequate hematological parameter define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.0 K/microL , hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL , platelet count great equal 75 K/microL Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN , AST ALT &lt; 3 time ULN Adequate renal function creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 40 mL/min . CrCl calculate use Cockcroft-Gault method . If calculate CrCl base Cockcroft-Gault method &lt; 40 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also great equal 40 ml/min Design : Single arm , single stage , phase II trial lenalidomide maintenance treat MM patient stable responsive disease . After screen , eligibility determination , enrollment ; subject receive lenalidomide 10 mg mouth daily day 1-21 repeat 28-day cycle . When necessary , lenalidomide hold restarted accordance accept clinical dose modification guideline . Subjects may continue lenalidomide disease progression unacceptable toxicity completion two year lenalidomide therapy 30 day safety follow-up visit . Blood obtain assess change T cell ( CD4 , CD8 ) , NKT NK cell number flow-cytometric analysis pre-specified time point lenalidomide maintenance . Blood sample and/or bone marrow sample possible , use additional research study , may include functional analysis immune-cell subset , analysis cytokine , chemokines , antibody , tumor cell antigen target , and/or marker .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients multiple myeloma treat induction therapy reinduction therapy , time study enrollment document evidence stable disease response well accord International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel . The response assessment must occur least 4 week completion last treatment . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use lenalidomide patient ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Patient must adequate hematologic , renal , hepatic , cardiac function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.0 K/microL independent growth factor support Platelets great equal 75K/microL Hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) Calculated creatinine ( CrCl ) clearance great equal 40 mL/min . use CockcroftGault method . If calculate CrCl base CockcroftGault method Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time ULN Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must agree use two effective form contraception simultaneously practice complete abstinence heterosexual intercourse follow time period relate study : 1 ) least 28 day start study drug ; 2 ) participate study ; 3 ) least 28 day discontinuation study . The two method effective contraception must include one highly effective method ( i.e . intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal [ birth control pill , injection , implant ] , tubal ligation , partner 's vasectomy ) one additional effective ( barrier ) method ( i.e . latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) . FCBP must refer qualified provider contraceptive method need . A FCBP define sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . A FCBP must two negative serum urine pregnancy test prior start study drug . The first pregnancy test must perform within 1014 day prior start study drug second pregnancy test must perform within 24 hour prior prescribe study drug . The prescription study drug must fill within 7 day . Male patient must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP participate study least 28 day follow discontinuation study even undergone successful vasectomy . Patient must able take aspirin ( 81 325 mg ) daily prophylactic anticoagulation . Patients intolerant ASA may use warfarin low molecular weight heparin . Patient must understand voluntarily sign informed consent form , understanding patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice future medical care . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients progressive refractory MM , define International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel criterion . Refractory lenalidomide recent line therapy , define International Myeloma Consensus Panel criterion failure achieve minimal response development progressive disease lenalidomide within 30 day lenalidomide therapy Patients receive investigational agent intent treat myeloma . Permitted concurrent therapy include : Bisphosphonates Radiotherapy single stable disease site Plasma cell leukemia Pregnant lactating female . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lenalidomide , lactate female must agree breast feed take lenalidomide . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes Active hepatitis B C infection Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year prior study enrollment , exception complete resection nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ malignancy Previous diagnosis another malignancy evidence residual disease . Patients seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , and/or take antiretroviral treatment HIV/AIDS Prior organ transplant require immunosuppressive therapy Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant Patients require continuous , systemic immunosuppressive therapy Patients myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia Patients condition would prevent absorption study drug Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited uncontrolled infection psychiatric illness/social situation would compromise compliance study requirement Significant neuropathy great equal Grade 3 baseline Contraindication concomitant anticoagulation prophylaxis Major surgery within 1 month prior enrollment Patients previously expose develop severe adverse event , hypersensitivity desquamate rash either thalidomide lenalidomide</criteria>
