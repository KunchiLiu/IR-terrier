	<brief_summary>The focus study individualize exercise prescription primary prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Special attention set autonomic nervous system function inflammation . This study seek novel , cost-effective model exercise prescription emphasize individual response health would easily implement primary health care primary prevention CVD . According power calculation , sixty woman plan pregnancy BMI equal 30 and/or history GDM recruit randomize individual exercise arm ( n=20 ) , general exercise arm ( n=20 ) control arm ( n=20 ) . General intervention group receive general exercise dietary counsel whereas personal exercise dietary program plan individualized exercise group . Those randomize control arm receive dietary exercise information . Clinical exercise test autonomic nervous system test perform begin study 3 month intervention . Blood sample marker inflammation , glucose homeostasis lipid status collect prepregnancy period 1 year delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes ( GDM ) one early sign increase risk develop CVD . In addition independent association , GDM increase CVD risk type 2 diabetes . The physiological basis disease progression yet fully understood . Increasing evidence exists interplay insulin resistance subclinical inflammation , recently unbalance autonomic nervous system . There unequivocal evidence increase physical activity regular exercise prevent risk factor give rise cardiovascular complication . According recent meta-analysis , exercise start continue throughout pregnancy may lead mark GDM risk reduction . Unfortunately , exercise lifestyle study usually unstructured unsupervised meet current guideline . There also significant gap understand target , deliver prescribe beneficial type exercise patient risk community . Sixty woman plan pregnancy BMI equal 30 and/or history GDM recruit randomize individual exercise arm ( n=20 ) , general exercise arm ( n=20 ) control arm ( n=20 ) . General intervention group receive general exercise dietary counsel whereas personal exercise dietary program plan individualized exercise group . Those randomize control arm receive dietary exercise information . All subject follow diabetes nurse every 3 month follow : time recruitment , 3 month intervention period , int 1st , 2nd 3rd trimester pregnancy 6 week , 6 month 1 year postpartum . The following measurement perform every visit : blood pressure , weight , waist-to-hip ratio , glucose homeostasis ( 2-h OGTT , Pf- insulin , Pf- glucose , insulin resistance ( Homa-IR ) , GHbA1c , lipid ( total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride ) , inflammatory marker ( sCRP , S-amyloid A , IL-1 6 , alpha 1-glycoprotein , SHBG ) , adipokines ( endothelin , adrenomedullin , adiponectin ) , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP , proBNP ) .For study participant , 15 D EDPS questionnaire use assessment quality life mental health . Registered cost intervention calculate cost-effectiveness analysis . Both endurance strength training include exercise program individual exercise study group . Heart rate monitor heart rate belt register internet-based exercise diary instantly follow exercise professional . This information use fine-tuning exercise prescription intervention period . Diet weight target plan individually dietician . Actualized diet register internet-based diary instantly follow study dietician guide subject personally e-mail suggest dietary change need . All subject perform exercise test beginning study 3 month intervention step incremental protocol cycle ergometer volitional fatigue . Extensive advance technology use monitor exercise response , include breath-by-breath ventilation alveolar gas exchange ; exercise ECG ; impedance cardiography ; automatic arterial blood pressure ; analysis system heart rate variability blood pressure variability , baroreflex sensitivity , muscle electrical activity , arterial O2 saturation local cerebral muscle tissue oxygenation near-infrared spectroscopy . The autonomic nervous system measurement , include 24 hour ECG monitoring , heart rate variability assessment control breathe rate , orthostatic test 5 min handgrip test , perform another visit laboratory . Total haemoglobin mass blood volume determine carbonmonoxy rebreathing method .</detailed_description>
