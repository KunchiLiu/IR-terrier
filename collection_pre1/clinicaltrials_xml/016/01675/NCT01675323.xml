	<detailed_description>Moderate severe Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) major public health problem , significantly affect 1.5 3 % adult Americans ( 3 - 7 million ) , result profound sleep loss urge move sit rest late part day . Work productivity decrease 20 % , quality life bad bad chronic disease , e.g . arthritis diabetes , increase cardio-vascular disease risk . Current approve dopaminergic treatment fail improve sleep time , engender impulsive behavior may make RLS bad . New treatment new research direction find need . The current research focus sensory feature fail address important aspect RLS ; i.e . 'hyperarousal ' profound chronic sleep loss without significant excessive daytime sleepiness . This hyperarousal produce RLS symptom overwhelm normal inhibitory process need decrease sensory motor cortical activity rest sleep . Thus hyperarousal produce RLS need move try rest inability maintain sleep .

The new concept hyperarousal add miss dimension understand RLS , namely discovery Glu abnormality central relation hyperarousal feature . It open opportunity develop new animal cell RLS research .

	<criteria>All subject 1 . 18 year old 2 . Normal mental status able give inform consent . 3 . Regular sleep time start 21:00 01:00 5 7 day week 4 . General good health ambulatory RLS patient 1 . Diagnosis primary RLS confirm PI Dr. Earley 2 . History indicate RLS symptom treat , thy would last 6 month 1 . Occur least 5 7 day week 2 . Almost always disrupt sleep 3 . For phase 2 admission Clinical Research Unit : Home screen clinical log show RLS symptoms least 5 7 day , IRLS score end home monitoring ≥ 15 PAMRL measure show average PLMS/hr ≥15 . Control subject 1 . No history 4 essential criterion diagnosis RLS ( 1 ) . 2 . For phase 2 admission Clinical Research Unit : Home screening PAMRL indicate average PLMS/hr ≤ 10 sleepwake log show regular time bed 21:00 01:00 bed time 6.0 10.0 hour bed 5 7 night . All subject 1 . Major mental history determine history 2 . Clinically significant sleep apnea prior PSG screen first night PSG ( apnea/hypopnea rate &gt; 15/hr ) . 3 . Any medical neurological disorder RLS likely compromise normal sleep , interfere interpretation result , would place subject risk participate study ( e.g . Chronic pain , dementia , ALS , stroke , MS , untreated thyroid ) . 4 . Any use DA antagonists one week past 6 month , nausea . 5 . Women pregnant lactate risk get pregnant ( use appropriate birth control postmenopausal ) . 6 . Failure clear hand dominance , ambidextrous assess Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( Could influence outcomes TMS ) . 7 . Musicians professional typist ( Might influence performance TMS measure ) 8 . A significant neurological disorder ( stroke , Parkinson 's Disorder , Multiple Sclerosis ) could impair fine motor performance . 9 . Metal body ( e.g. , pacemaker , implantable pump , stimulators , orthodontics , etc ) would cause problem MRI TMS . 10 . Medication use would alter sleep include GABA active medication anti depressant significant psychiatric medication medication would affect Glu . 11 . History claustrophobia problem close MRI scan resolve . 12 . History vertigo , seizure disorder , middleear disorder , double vision . 13 . Body size compatible use T7 MRI . RLS patient 1 . History clinically significant sleep disorder RLS . 2 . Medical disorder current medication use exacerbates might start RLS Control subject 1 . History clinically significant sleep disorder include insomnia ( primary psychophysiological ) 2 . Score Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory ( PSQI ) &gt; 5 3 . Family history indicate possible RLS firstdegree relative</criteria>
