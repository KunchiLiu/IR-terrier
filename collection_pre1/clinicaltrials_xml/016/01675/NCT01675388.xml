	<brief_title>Hypothermia During ECMO Decrease Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Term late preterm neonate severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [ NHRF ] receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) , modify form cardiopulmonary bypass , maximal conventional therapy fails . Although ECMO significantly improve survival decrease disability , 15-50 % survivor nevertheless poor neurodevelopmental [ ND ] outcome due hypoxemia cerebral hypoperfusion occur prior ECMO . Hypothermia [ HYP ] ( 33 deg-34 deg C 48-72 hour ) show improve ND outcomes follow neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [ NE ] . Whether addition hypothermia ECMO severe NHRF improve ND outcomes unknown . Long-term evaluation ND outcomes gold standard determine full spectrum developmental disability neonatal clinical finding ; biochemical electrophysiological test ; cranial sonography limit predictive value . Conventional magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] predictive accuracy &gt; 0.8 death disability follow NE . MR abnormalities infant undergo ECMO NHRF differ see NE systematic report ND implication MR abnormality see NHRF treat ECMO . Given societal economic cost associate poor long-term ND outcome challenge neurologic assessment critically ill neonate receive ECMO NHRF , urgent need ( ) neuroprotection pre-/during ECMO decrease brain injury ( ii ) innovative diagnostic modality enable early diagnosis intervention . Our goal improve treatment ND outcomes neonate NHRF . The overall objective proposal establish neuroprotective role hypothermia ECMO NHRF evaluate ND assessment 18-22 month [ mo ] age validate use conventional advanced MR technique biomarkers brain injury . The central hypothesis ( ) HYP 33.5°C 1st 72 hour ECMO NHRF reduce extent severity brain injury evaluate Bayley Scales Infant Development ( BSID-III ) cognitive score 18-22 mo proportion normal MRI study neonatal period 18-22 mo ; ( ii ) conventional advanced MR technique neonatal period 18-22 mo biomarkers brain injury allow prediction ND outcomes , monitor post-injury brain growth plasticity . The specific aim evaluate : 1 . Safety efficacy hypothermia combine ECMO NHRF improve neurodevelopmental outcomes 18-22 month age 2 . MR abnormalities neonatal period 18-22 month age predictive accuracy neurodevelopmental outcomes 18-22 month age follow hypothermia ECMO NHRF MRI obtain neonatal period part routine clinical care ; MRI repeat 18-22 mo age outpatient basis funding available assess longitudinal change brain structure metabolite profile follow ECMO NHRF correlate ND outcomes 18-22 mo age .</detailed_description>
