	<brief_title>Heat Retention Head Wrap Use Re-warming Infants Requiring Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization body temperature 36-36.5 degree Celsius mild hypothermia , 32-36 degree Celsius moderate hypothermia , &lt; 32 degree Celsius severe hypothermia.1 Hypothermia major postoperative problem infant undergo cardio-pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) surgery . During CPB , patient cool decrease metabolism protect myocardium brain . When repair complete , patient re-warmed temperature blood bypass pump gradually increase . However , separation CBP pump , infant consistently experience temperature drop 2 5 degree Celsius . With head cool heat dissipates quickly body surface . As much 60 % infant 's body heat dissipate uncovered head , thus leave patient high risk complication associate hypothermia . The amount heat lose environment newborn infant great impact mortality rate , growth , energy maintenance . Major adverse effect inadvertent hypothermia include myocardial ischemia , impaired coagulation , prolong healing , surgical wound infection , decrease postoperative comfort . Nursing participation re-warming patient CPB surgery core intervention . According recommendation perioperative registered nurse patient return normothermia conclusion immediate postoperative period . Current standard care re-warming CPB include particular type head cover . Recently , new head cover make biaxial-oriented polyethylene terephthalate ( boPET ) , call Heat Retention Head Wrap , design use infant facilitate warm postoperative period ( begin re-warming phase CBP ) . The purpose study determine feasibility use Heat Retention Head Wrap infants re-warming period follow CPB . Specific Aims 1 . To describe feasibility place Heat Retention Head Wrap infant 's head time re-warming process begin time baby arrive Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) transfer operate room . 2 . To characterize temperature progression ( 1 ) onset re-warming , ( 2 ) removal bypass cannula , ( 3 ) removal rectal temperature probe immediately transfer OR CICU , ( 4 ) upon arrival CICU . 3 . To identify describe adverse event observe use Heat Retention Head Wrap .</detailed_description>
