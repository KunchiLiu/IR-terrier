	<brief_summary>An increase body mass impair vascular function ( VF ) , important characteristic subject suffer type 2 diabetes risk marker cardiovascular disease . However , wide variety vivo VF marker exist measure different aspect VF . Each marker address different aspect vasculature . Studies compare standardized condition difference relationships many different VF measurement lean abdominally overweight / obese subject miss . Also , great need know marker sensitive dietary challenge . Therefore , imperative conduct extensive study dietary effect interrelationships broad spectrum VF measurement plasma biomarkers lean overweight / obese subject . Focus FMD , well accept biomarker cardiovascular disease . The investigator propose examine , two-way parallel-randomized human intervention study , effect weight-loss abdominally overweight / obese men VF marker plasma biomarkers related low-grade inflammation vascular activity fast postprandial hyperinsulinemic state . Furthermore , differences - relation - VF measurement plasma biomarkers compare cross-sectionally lean abdominally overweight / obese male subject .</brief_summary>
