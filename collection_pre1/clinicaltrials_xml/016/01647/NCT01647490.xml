	<brief_title>Right Ventricular Lead Placement Pacemaker Population : Evaluation Apical Alternative Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Permanent cardiac pacing play important role cardiac disease management . Since early study right ventricular pacing , apex prefer implant site transvenous endocardial ventricular lead several reason : ease placement , lead stability well design characteristic electrode fixation system . It also accept , however , right ventricle pace cause long term deterioration leave ventricular function complex effect , structural level heart wall hemodynamic level leave ventricular load condition . It possible deterioration due dyssynchrony contraction induce pace right ventricular apex . Some author suggest pace right ventricle alternative site , i.e . medium septum ( RVS ) region , guarantee physiological activation pattern , especially patient expect receive high pacing percentage . However , unequivocal evidence stimulation right ventricular septum physiological apical pacing still miss . Nonetheless , note , although number study refer RV septum alternative site pacing , poor attention pay unambiguous definition RV septum region . A clear definition proper evaluation alternative site therefore important . Furthermore , procedural point view , demonstrate acute chronic electrical performance lead position alternative site , particular region mid septum , equivalent lead position apical site . The purpose study perform comprehensive assessment electrical mechanical measure obtain pace standard RV site ( Right ventricular apex , RVA ) alternative RV site ( right ventricular septum , RVS ) . Specifically , two pace site compare term electrical dyssynchrony , assess ECG criterion , term mechanical dyssynchrony , assess echocardiographic criterion . The primary end point study define evaluation dyssynchrony measure spontaneous rhythm ( Vs ) pace rhythm ( Vp ) . The delay time peak systolic velocity septum LV free wall use define degree dyssynchrony ; measurement obtain TDI echocardiographic technique . Patients receive commercially available dual-chamber implantable pacemaker , accord current standard indication . At end implantation follow-up visit ( 12 24 month ) device program follow clinical practice center .</detailed_description>
