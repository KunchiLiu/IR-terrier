	<brief_summary>This study aim use type radiation ( adaptive radiotherapy ) deliver curative-intent treatment patient non-small cell lung cancer , whose tumor would otherwise large standard curative treatment . The study use adaptive radiotherapy achieve goal . Adaptive radiotherapy process whereby treatment plan modify course treatment due patient tumor variation ( ie . weight loss tumor shrinkage ) . This may allow dose escalation , limit side effect .</brief_summary>
