	<brief_summary>Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) one common endocrine disorder . The major clinical symptom involve stone , bone , abdominal groan psychiatric moan . Increased parathyroid cell proliferation decrease calcium-mediated control PTH secretion characteristic finding . The common cause PHPT adenoma follow hyperplasia carcinoma.The molecular mechanism involve parathyroid tumorigenesis partially know . Few gene identify role study . The gene study different group unable give definite direction towards understand parathyroid tumorigenesis mechanism involve overgrowth parathyroid tissue . So identifying different protein regulation pattern adenoma carcinomas initial step towards understand protein involve tumorigenesis parathyroid tissue . By use proteomics approach one generate protein level information . In study , use combine approach base 2 D gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry ( MS ) , investigator propose study comparative proteomics examine change protein profile parathyroid tumor tissue normal hyperplasic parathyroid tissue . This work plan help u understand differentially expressed protein patient PHPT . This help understand disease identify well diagnostic curative measure disease . The investigator also plan access nuclear morphometry change sporadic parathyroid tumor . It help establish cellular nuclear change pattern variation normal parathyroid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects : All PHPT patient attend outdoor patient clinic Endocrinology General Surgery department Nehru Hospital , PGIMER , Chandigarh enrol study . Sample collection : A parathyroid tissue sample take patient undergoing parathyroidectomy . Samples collect immediately surgery , snap frozen store -80oC use . In addition 10 ml blood also take patient estimate biochemical parameter . Controls : Normal parathyroid gland use control obtain patient undergo thyroidectomy multinodular goiter elective procedure institute .</detailed_description>
