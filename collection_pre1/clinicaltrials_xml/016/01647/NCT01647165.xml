	<brief_summary>Background : Bortezomib drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat patient multiple myeloma . It give intravenous injection . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system . It may also help suppress tumor growth . It approve FDA treat type blood cancer . Dexamethasone prevents treats inflammation . It sometimes use treat multiple myeloma . Objectives : The purpose study examine combination study drug affect myeloma . Eligibility : - Participants least 18 year old multiple myeloma come back , respond treatment , worsen treat . - Participants may pregnant tested ensure pregnant . Design : - Participants screen history physical examination . Blood work urine sample take . A series x-rays bone do . A bone marrow biopsy do . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Treatment continue long cancer grow spread serious side effect develop . - There eight 21-day treatment cycle . - Bortezomib give subcutaneous ( skin ) ( SC ) injection day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 cycle . - Lenalidomide give mouth day 1 14 cycle . - Dexamethasone give mouth day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 cycle . - Following cycle eight , disease stable good , participant receive bortezomib SC dose give end cycle eight . - Participants take valacyclovir acyclovir take bortezomib prevent virus infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Subcutaneous ( SC ) Bortezomib , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma ; Followed SC Bortezomib Maintenance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable plasma cell neoplasm median survival 3-4 year . - Increased survival achieve introduction proteasome inhibitor bortezomib immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) lenalidomide . Bortezomib lenalidomide different overlap mechanism anti-MM activity preclinical study . - Despite benefit novel agent , bortezomib lenalidomide pose clinical challenge . Bortezomib drug toxicity include neuropathy , GI distress , myelosuppression herpes zoster reactivation . Together lenalidomide , incidence sensory neuropathy reach 80 % . - Subcutaneous ( SC ) Bortezomib evaluate prospective phase I trial relapse and/or refractory MM . SC administration find comparable establish IV route , difference overall systemic availability pharmacodynamic activity , similar toxicity profile , similar response rate . - Combining SC , rather IV bortezomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone especially attractive give potential less overall neurotoxicity improve convenience patient . - Also , use bortezomib SC maintenance therapy combination therapy novel strategy potential set stage come oral proteasome inhibitor potential maintenance strategy future . Objectives : Primary Objective - Determine response rate , S.C. bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( VRd ) relapse and/or refractory MM patient Secondary Objectives - Assess peripheral blood immune cell population relation SC bortezomib maintenance - Evaluate toxicity , include peripheral neuropathy - Evaluate pattern change patient-reported quality life symptom distress - Gauge feasibility , responsiveness change associate effect size use patient-reported outcome augment clinician rating regimen-related treatment toxicity , include incidence severity peripheral neuropathy - Determine duration response - Determine progression free survival Eligibility : - Patients histologically confirm relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma - Age great equal 18 year - Without serious co-morbidity would interfere receipt VRd - If patient neuropathy , must less equal Grade 1 time first dose within 14 day enrollment - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.0 K/uL , hemoglobin le equal 8 g/dL , platelet count great equal 75 K/uL - Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; AST ALT &lt; 3.0 time ULN - Creatinine Clearance great equal 60 ml/min . CrCl calculate Cockcroft-Gault method . CrCl ( calculate ) = ( 140 Age ) time Mass ( kilogram ) time [ 0.85 Female ] 72 time Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) . If calculate CrCl base Cockcroft-Gault method &lt; 60 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also great equal 60 ml/min patient eligible . Design : Patient receive treatment single arm study 8 total cycle ( cycle 21 day ) follow drug , dosage schedule : - Bortezomib Cycle 1-8 : 1.0 mg/m ( 2 ) SC concentration 2.5 mg/ml thigh abdomen day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 21 day cycle - Lenalidomide Cycle 1 : 15 mg oral daily day 2-14 21 day cycle Cycle 2-8 : 15 mg oral daily day 1-14 21 day cycle - Dexamethasone Cycle 1 : 10 mg oral day 2,4,5,8,9,11,12 21 day cycle Cycle 2-8 : 10 mg oral day 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12 21 day cycle - Maintenance therapy After completion cycle 8 , patient great equal stable disease receive maintenance bortezomib S.C. dose per end Cycle 8 . Maintenance give day 1 15 28 day cycle , continue progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
