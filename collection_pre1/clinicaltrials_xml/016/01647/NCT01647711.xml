	<brief_summary>This trial divide Part A Part B . The primary objective Part A establish Maximal Tolerated Dose intermittent high dose afatinib . The primary objective Part B ass response rate patient non-small cell lung cancer EGFR T790M mutation dose intermittent afatinib establish Part A . The secondary objective explore tumor response tumor-derived biological marker response afatinib , well pharmacokinetic parameter afatinib .</brief_summary>
