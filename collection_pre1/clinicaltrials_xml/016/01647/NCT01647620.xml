	<brief_summary>A study investigate concentration new drug DPOC-4088 blood , study effect drug blood clot parameter . Furthermore relation blood concentration blood clot effect investigate . Safety investigate well . The objective investigation determine optimal dose DPOC-4088 , achieve relevant increase specific blood clotting parameter ( ecarin clot time ) without safety concern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Healthy Volunteer Study Investigate Blood Concentrations , Effect Blood Clotting Safety Multiple Doses DPOC-4088 Tablets Different Doses .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , stepwise study multiple once-daily oral dose DPOC-4088 ( 100 mg Step 1 ) healthy young male subject . Each Step study include 10 subject consist screen eligibility follow 13-day period once-daily oral dos DPOC-4088 placebo administer 10 consecutive day blood sample PK/PD measurement . In dose step , 8 subject receive active drug 2 subject receive match placebo accord randomize allocation schedule . During Step , DPOC-4088 placebo give morning Days 1 10 , safety permitting . Each 10 day dose preceded overnight fast ( 10 hour ) . Subjects frequent PK/PD sampling perform 24 hour period follow dose Day 1 72-hour period follow dose Day 10 . On Days 1 10 , first meal give 4 hour post-dosing . On dose day , subject breakfast one hour dosing . Blood sample draw PK PD evaluation immediately prior dose specified time interval post-dosing . Following completion 10 day dose Step , subject return follow-up examination 1 week ( 7-9 day ) . After completion dose Step 1 , PK , PD safety data analyze ( necessary ) use determine dose Step 2 , procedure follow next dose step , necessary . The safety , tolerability , PK profile DPOC-4088 assess . Additionally , study ass PD profile relationship PK/PD term ability DPOC-4088 inhibit thrombin activity ( base prolongation aPTT , ECT , TT PT ) . To main objective determine dose DPOC-4088 , follow multiple once-daily oral dosing , achieve target increase 2-fold baseline ecarin clot time ( ECT ) steady-state trough plasma concentration ( Cmin-ss ) without safety concern .</detailed_description>
