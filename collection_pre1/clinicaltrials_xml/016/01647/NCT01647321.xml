	<brief_summary>Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) subtype multiple sclerosis ( MS ) exist therapy alter disease course . This research utilize cut edge functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) cycle technology goal improve walk individual SPMS . The investigator hypothesize FES cycle improve walk subject SPMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation Individuals With Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) experience significant impairment ambulation lead use cane , walker , ultimately wheelchairs . Treatment attempt progressive MS disappointing . No therapeutic intervention show modulate disability patient SPMS . FES cycle show multiple primary medical benefit include : increased muscle mass , improvement bone density , enhance cardiovascular function , improve bowel function , decrease spasticity reduction bladder infection rate . More importantly FES may modulate inflammatory CNS environment progressive MS . The investigator propose novel , easy implement intervention strategy FES cycling help improve gait function individual SPMS . A successful outcome large SPMS population would significant impact towards change MS clinical care . FES easily transferable clinical practice could potentially ameliorate complication associate SPMS spasticity , mood fatigue reduce burden health care cost . In addition , investigator gain good understand mechanism underlying change could use design new therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
