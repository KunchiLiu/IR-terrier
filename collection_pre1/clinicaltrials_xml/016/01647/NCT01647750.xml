	<brief_summary>All patient hypothyroidism currently treat way , regardless age . The investigator want look whether people age 80 year old would benefit treated low dos levothyroxine . There three reason investigator think could beneficial , yet prove : 1 . Some old people hypothyroidism may symptoms . 2 . Doctors look amount Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) patient 's blood decide dose Thyroxine receive . The standard `` normal '' TSH range use determine dose levothyroxine young people . The investigator wonder whether appropriate age range particularly investigator know old people may normally high TSH value . 3 . If TSH level low may slight increase risk problem brittle bone irregular heartbeat . The best way test whether old people benefit low dos levothyroxine large clinical trial . Before investigator , investigator need run small clinical trial call `` pilot study '' ( SORTED 1 ) examine whether practical acceptable . The pilot study aim recruit 50 patient hypothyroidism age 80 . Participants randomly allocate receive routine lower dose levothyroxine . Follow-up conduct approximately 25 week . The investigator also propose qualitative study ( SORTED 2 ) specifically understand patient 's willingness take part RCT participant 's experience intervention . Finally , investigator propose retrospective cohort study 400 treat hypothyroid patient age 80 year register 2008 Primary Care Practices aim study outcomes 4 year . The cohort study collect data require inform sample size calculation future full study primary outcome 4 year mortality .</brief_summary>
