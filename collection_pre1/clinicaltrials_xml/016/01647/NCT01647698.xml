	<brief_title>Pilot Study Determine Working Memory Training Aids Cognitive Functioning Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) exclusively motor disease ; half individual PD experience cognitive impairment even early stage disease many develop dementia disease progress . As result , attention , memory , plan organizational skill affect , interfere everyday functioning ( e.g . shopping , managing finance , job skill ) . Thus , intervention improve cognitive ability need enhance psychosocial function overall quality life . Some cognitive deficit , problem work memory , apparent even early stage disease . Working memory ( WM ) ability actively maintain manipulate information one 's mind need many complex task learn , communication problem-solving . Individuals PD often show deficit WM maintenance ( e.g. , hold phone number mind make call ) manipulation ( e.g. , mental calculation grocery store checkout ) skill , depend upon stage disease progression damage frontal-subcortical circuit . Attempts identify pharmacological agent ameliorate cognitive dysfunction largely unsuccessful associate undesirable side effect ( e.g . Vale , 2009 ) . The investigator propose specific cognitive training improve WM could provide direct benefit psychosocial function PD patient ; could potentially enhance positive benefit reduce negative effect pharmacological treatment without add risk side effect well . Promising intervention focus intensive direct WM training emerge show generalize cognitive domain , fluid intelligence . Cognitive training successful patient traumatic brain injury , also show WM deficit result damage frontal-subcortical circuit . In addition , successful WM training associate change dopamine receptor density well change pattern neural activity task-relevant area brain . To date , limited number small group study provide preliminary evidence aspect cognitive function enhance training PD patient also receive dopaminergic therapy , although use control group account potential repeat test practice effect .</detailed_description>
