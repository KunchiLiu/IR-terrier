	<brief_title>A Proof Concept Study Determine Local Delivery Efficacy Nanocort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity mortality develop nation . CVD primarily cause atherosclerosis , systemic disease characterize lipid deposition subendothelial space concomitant , low-grade inflammatory reaction . Nowadays , therapeutic intervention aim lower CVD thus far focused modulate lipid level , either lower LDLc increase HDLc level . Yet , since introduction statins 20 year ago , breakthrough treatment disease . In fact , recent failure potent HDL-increasing drug , i.e . torcetrapib , emphasize need also consider non-lipid modulate target . A promising strategy reduce CVD directly target inflammation level vessel wall . A potential drawback anti-inflammatory strategy pertains thin line inhibit 'inappropriate ' inflammation versus induce immuno-suppression . One strategies limit systemic immunosuppression strive local delivery prolong efficacy low systemic burden drug encapsulate compound liposome . Liposome-encapsulated drug efficiently target lesion accumulate much high extent desire area interest . This approach currently use clinical treatment different type cancer ( liposomal doxorubicin ) fungal infection ( liposomal amphotericine-B ) . Liposomes application ( rheumatoid arthritis , cystic fibrosis , multiple sclerosis atherosclerosis ) pre-clinically develop investigated clinical trial . Recent pre-clinical study animal model corroborate liposomal glucocorticoid effectively attenuate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation exhibit improved pharmacokinetics biodistribution . Also , local delivery localization liposomes inflammatory site local macrophage demonstrate animal model . In human , potential PEG-liposomes target inflammatory site show image radioactive liposome . However , concept local delivery ( prolong ) efficacy liposomal corticosteroid inflammatory site , atherosclerosis , local macrophage remains determined human . Thus , local delivery prolong efficacy important tool overcome potential drawback anti-inflammatory drug ; namely inappropriate immune suppression . To proof concept , investigator need evaluate local delivery efficacy site inflammation ( atherosclerosis ) intravenously administer liposomal glucocorticoid ( Nanocort ) compare free glucocorticoid ( Prednison ) . Only compare two drug , investigator prove potential benefit nanomedicine vehicle local drug delivery . This major implication future drug strategy cardiovascular disease . In present project , investigator therefore aim evaluate delivery superior efficacy Nanocort Prednison placebo patient peripheral artery disease due atherosclerosis . Because patient undergo endarteriectomy investigator able collect atherosclerotic material drug administration thus evaluate local delivery compare effect Nanocort Prednison Placebo .</detailed_description>
