	<detailed_description>Patients autism significant social difficulty communication alteration . It show patient difficulty understand clue indispensable social relation , example , face emotion motion human body . The face human movement important source information help interact others . Understanding intention others facial expression gesture help adapt behavior interaction . While healthy subject , face human movement receive special attention , autistic patient seem pay less attention kind social stimulus . It already show child healthy adult spend time look face human movement ( relative object ) , whereas opposite behavior observe patient autism . Studying gaze behavior seem essential progress understand autism pathology . Eye-tracking system allow measure precisely subject look picture . Moreover , eye-tracking system permit measurement pupil size variation correlate cognitive process . The objective study analyze ocular behavior ( ocular scan path pupil diameter ) young patient autism view face human movement compare measurement chronologically age-matched healthy child . This work identify attentional problem concern exploration human face movement related social difficulty . These disorder manifest atypical ocular scan path change pupil variation response face human motion . Then follow evolution index allow evaluate effect therapy . These result highlight new data essential understanding disorder social relation well adapt rehabilitative strategy .</detailed_description>
