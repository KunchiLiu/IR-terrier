	<detailed_description>Breast cancer young woman common disease , yet 12,000 woman 40 diagnose invasive breast cancer yearly United States alone additional 2000 diagnose noninvasive disease . Furthermore , young woman diagnose breast cancer , burden disease treatment population great . Breast cancer lead cause cancer-related death woman 40 , survival rate young woman breast cancer lower old counterpart ( 21,22 ) . In addition high risk die breast cancer , therefore usually receive aggressive therapy , young woman high risk distress diagnosis follow-up . Young woman breast cancer face variety problem unique accentuate young age ( 1 ) . They likely diagnose stage life fill multiple role may easily take others ( e.g . parent young child , complete education , develop career ) . Concerns attractiveness fertility often substantial importance population , many young woman interested biologic child follow treatment . They also great risk harbor genetic risk factor breast cancer old patient .

Many group , include , demonstrate substantial inadequacy attention fertility menopausal risk population despite recent guideline recommend consideration every young patient ( 15-20 ) . Weight gain another common concern woman diagnose breast cancer associate reduction physical activity . Studies demonstrate 68 % woman early stage breast cancer gain weight diagnosis woman receive chemotherapy high risk weight gain , especially premenopausal woman go menopause treatment ( 33-36 ) . Some evidence suggest exercise may help prevent treatment-related weight gain improve psychological outcome woman diagnose early stage breast cancer ( 38-40 ) . Importantly , exercise lack weight gain repeatedly associate improved disease outcome breast cancer survivor ( 41-43 ) . Again , available evidence suggest majority breast cancer survivor participate regular physical activity clearly room improvement ( 43-45 ) . Currently , encourage physical activity well-recognized standard breast cancer care , intervention assist patient provider increase patient exercise behavior standard oncology care need . Among old woman , access information psychosocial support associate well quality life breast cancer survivor . However , data available indicate process operate young woman specifically service might mitigate psychosocial distress ( 29-32 ) . We believe attention issue young woman breast cancer outline may associate good satisfaction quality care treatment decision , decrease distress , good overall quality life . To address critical issue , develop comprehensive Program Young Women Breast Cancer Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ( DFCI ) provide additional care , support , education young woman breast cancer . Based preliminary success program , seek export unique model care young woman breast cancer receive care outside comprehensive cancer center effort improve quality care deliver , satisfaction care , psychosocial well-being vulnerable population . In proposed study , build previous work develop piloted educational support intervention improve quality care deliver young woman breast cancer . To achieve aim , create educational intervention focus issue face young woman breast cancer , include limited fertility , satisfaction care , physical activity . We use piloted component Program Young Women Breast Cancer , well pilot exercise intervention material , create two educational intervention population . We plan evaluate intervention randomize control trial ( RCT ) community academic practice respective patient randomize intervention either focus issue unique young woman breast cancer ( Young Women 's Intervention , YWI ) one focus lead healthy lifestyle breast cancer patient ( Physical Activity Intervention , PAI ) . The rigorous study design research provide important information effect intervention improve care young woman breast cancer . Therefore , intervention , hope elucidate factor might improve quality life young woman breast cancer . Ultimately , work provide model intervene improve care unique population .</detailed_description>
