	<brief_summary>Of estimate one million Americans inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , approximately 20-30 % develop condition childhood adolescence , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . It appear individual genetically susceptible certain nutrient , cause inflammation disturbance immune system , well disruption intestinal barrier . This lead malnutrition inhibited growth , many patient experience intense abdominal pain diarrhea . Most physicians treat disease drug suppress immune system decrease inflammatory process . Although drug frequently induce remission , patient experience subsequent return symptom fail catch growth . Additionally , serious side effect associate drug . Individuals genetically prone CD believe leaky gut allow substance pass intestinal wall react underlie immune system . Furthermore , nutrient toxic individual pass decrease intestinal barrier trigger extreme immune response . Nutrients implicated include grain , except rice , dairy product , food contain carrageenan . Excluding nutrient diet show beneficial CD patient . Certain nutraceuticals , curcumin omega-3 fatty acid , show provide anti-inflammatory effect IBD patient . In addition , administration growth hormone ( GH ) , show alleviate symptom , enhance repair intestinal epithelium , prevent toxic antigen reach underlying lamina propria . Previous study case report provide incomplete evidence exclusion diet nutraceuticals ( DNT ) GH lead sustain long term remission juvenile CD , discontinuation CD drug , catch growth . This study design test hypothesis . Patients treatment group treat DNT GH , continue receive medication physician control group receive DNT , placebo injection instead GH . We predict treatment group show great improvement control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The widely hold hypothesis regard pathogenesis inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) overly aggressive acquire immune response subset commensal enteric bacteria develop genetically susceptible host . In attempt avoid disease progression , patient treat anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody drug , frequently produce remission . However , drug usually fail achieve long-term , sustained remission reversal growth failure , associate serious side effect . Recently , intestinal barrier dysfunction implicate alternative 3-step model IBD pathogenesis . The investigator hypothesize exclusion diet nutraceutical therapy ( DNT ) decrease production toxic antigens gut reactive human growth hormone ( rhGH ) reduce passage remain toxic antigen underlie mucosal immune system promote maintenance intestinal barrier accelerate restitution intestinal epithelial lining . The following study test whether 3-step model accurate , whether rhGH DNT induce sustain remission juvenile CD patient .</detailed_description>
