In addition pilot patient provider survey material content , evaluate intervention feasibility recruitment implementation . We refine material method base pilot experience . Collectively , result qualitative assessment pilot help finalize material survey well method study plan multi-site intervention study ( YWI ) fund ASCO support Susan G. Komen Cure . A detailed plan parent study intervention submit IRB upon completion focus group , key informant interview pilot study describe .</detailed_description>
