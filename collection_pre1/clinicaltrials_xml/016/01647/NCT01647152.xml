	<brief_summary>Background : - Uveitis eye inflammation cause vision loss . It treat eye drop , drug sometimes surgery . In people , treatment may prevent vision loss . A type white blood cell call T-cells often role cause uveitis . In case uveitis , T-cells attack eye cause inflammation . A drug call ustekinumab reduces inflammation T-cells . Researchers want see ustekinumab use treat uveitis . Objectives : - To see ustekinumab use treat uveitis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age active uveitis need treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , eye exam , medical history . Blood urine sample take . - Participants least eight clinic visit 64-week study period . After first visit , visit occur 2 , 4 , 8 week , every 12 week . - Participants ustekinumab injection first study visit . They additional dos second third visit , every 12 week 1 year first dose ( Week 52 ) . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test eye exam . Other standard treatment uveitis may give need . - There final study visit 3 month last injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication uveitis cause significant adverse effect many patient continue experience disease flare-up . Ustekinumab human IL-12 -23 antagonist . The involvement IL-12 IL-23 pathophysiology uveitis autoimmune disease know associated uveitis suggest ustekinumab could potential treatment uveitis . The study objective investigate safety , tolerability potential efficacy subcutaneous injection ustekinumab possible treatment active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis . Study Population : Five participant active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis meet inclusion criterion initially enrol . Up seven participant may enrol , two participant may accrue account participant withdraw study prior Week 8 . Design : This prospective , non-randomized , uncontrolled , single-center pilot study evaluate subcutaneous injection ustekinumab possible treatment active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis . Participants receive 90 mg subcutaneous injection ustekinumab baseline second third injection Week 2 4 every 12 week thereafter . Participants continue receive injection ustekinumab every 12 week Week 52 . Participants return final safety visit 12 week later . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number participant experience treatment response ( define Appendix 1 ) Week 8 . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity , number participant experience recurrence , number day recurrence , presence extent macular edema , amount retino-vascular leakage , change retinal thickening , length time quiescence ability taper concomitant immunosuppressive medication . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event , proportion participant experience vision loss great equal 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter number participant experience substantial rise elevate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .</detailed_description>
