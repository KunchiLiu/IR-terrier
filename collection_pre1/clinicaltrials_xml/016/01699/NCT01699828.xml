	<brief_summary>The objective present study use positron emission tomography brain image investigate D3 occupancy buspirone , FDA-approved anxiolytic act serotonin partial agonist recently identify D3 antagonist . It hypothesize clinically relevant dos buspirone occupy D3 receptor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Occupancy Dopamine D3 Receptor Buspirone Humans Using PET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buspirone use anxiety disorder treatment , therapeutic effect think mediate partial agonist property serotonin receptor . However , since one PET study human show low occupancy serotonin buspirone clinical dos since DRD3 recently implicate anxiety , therapeutic effect buspirone may mediate DRD3 . In human clinical study , promise effect buspirone report treatment substance dependence , include tobacco , marijuana , opiates , clinical study cocaine dependent subject underway . However , unclear buspirone produce effect DRD3 human study incorporate PET image component investigate question ; remain unclear whether buspirone significantly occupy DRD3 therapeutic dos human .</detailed_description>
