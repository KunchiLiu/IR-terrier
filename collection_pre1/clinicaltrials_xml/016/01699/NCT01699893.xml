	<brief_title>Genetic &amp; Environmental Determinants Of Immune Phenotype Variance : Establishing A Path Towards Personalized Medicine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Susceptibility infection , disease severity , response medical therapy vaccine highly variable one individual another . While question variance human population continue focal point scientific research , medical practice public health policy typically take 'one size fit ' model disease management drug development . Individual heterogeneity immune response enormous impact likelihood respond therapy development side effect secondary vaccine administration . Because complexity immune response individual within population , possible thus far define parameter ( genetic environmental ) constitute healthy immune system natural occur variability . Efforts restore 'personal ' medical care current challenge , drive vision project , current study belongs . In order realize promise personalized medicine , in-depth understanding determinant heterogeneity host response stress require .</detailed_description>
