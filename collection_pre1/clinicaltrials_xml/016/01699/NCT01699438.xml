	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) condition characterise abdominal pain discomfort combination alter bowel function ( stool frequency and/or stool consistency ) , currently define Rome III criterion . The current IBS definition specifies structural biochemical abnormality account symptom grow evidence least subset IBS patient , discrete immune activation might key pathogenetic factor . The condition prone develop gastroenteritis , post-infectious IBS , increase number lymphocyte , mast cell pro-inflammatory cytokine like Interleukin ( IL ) -1β , IL-6 , Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α general increase mucosal cellularity report . Despite , efficacy anti-inflammatory agent poorly investigate . This randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multi-centre study aim include total 200 subject irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . All subject randomise receive either 3x800 mg mesalazine ( Asacol® ) correspond placebo daily total treatment duration 8 week . Males female age 18 70 year already diagnose IBS base Rome III diagnostic criterion symptom intensity least moderate level ; define IBS Severity Scoring System ( IBS-SSS ) score ≥175 Screening ( Visit 1 , Day -21±2 ) Baseline ( Visit 2 , Day 0 ) eligible enter study . Primary aim : To assess effect mesalazine ( Asacol® ) treatment compare placebo global IBS symptom : A treatment responder define answer satisfactory relief IBS-symptoms question `` yes '' end least 4 8 treatment week . Secondary aim : To assess mesalazine ( Asacol® ) treatment compare placebo regard : 1 . Levels inflammatory mediator rectal mucosa ( e.g . neutrophil mediator , eosinophilic mediator , mast cell activity mediator cytokine ) measure new diagnostic tool , Mucosal Patch Technology ( MPT ) mean Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays ( ELISA ) 2 . Effects number immune cell ( count per high power field ) cytokine content ( immunohistochemistry ) mucosal biopsies 3 . Calprotectin level faeces ( mg/kg ) 4 . Individual IBS symptom parameter derive symptom diary also measure IBS-SSS</brief_summary>
