	<detailed_description>RATIONAL &amp; BACKGROUND INFORMATION Among Millennium Development Goals , aim reach significant reduction maternal child mortality prove hard achieve . Most maternal neonatal death cause condition , majority preventable currently available , effective intervention . About third stillbirth occur intrapartum period , integrally related availability quality essential emergency childbirth service . Effective intervention reduce maternal death , stillbirth newborn child death reach less half pregnant woman , mother , newborn child need . Information mortality morbidity well health care delivery largely available survey , inherent methodological issue limit validity . Vital registration information reliable information health system miss country burden mortality high health care least accessible . This lead underestimate magnitude problem negative implication prioritization intervention scale-up . The BMGF WHO support set large intervention trial follow cohort pregnant woman newborn document impact intervention . These trial provide unique opportunity address additional question relevant improve maternal , newborn child health ( MNCH ) program address above-mentioned gap data . STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES Goal The study conduct part large ongoing parent study newborn health research Haryana , India title `` Efficacy neonatal vitamin A supplementation improve child survival Haryana , India : generation evidence necessary inform global policy '' good understand epidemiology maternal mortality , stillbirths neonatal death . Objective The current study collect information burden , time cause neonatal death estimate maternal death still birth . The propose additional study present unique opportunity estimate population-based burden , timing , cause maternal death stillbirth . Study Design This observational study data collect retrospectively . Study Population This study conduct study area population parent study . The participant study pregnant woman identify surveillance among woman reproductive age population parent study conduct , newborn infant . Some woman eligible enrollment parent study due loss baby live baby exclusion criterion give consent parent study woman die pregnancy child birth may still include AMANHI study . Information woman refuse take part parent study document . This information use analysis explore whether group different risk maternal newborn mortality . Only control group parent study consider analysis neonatal death observational study . Maternal mortality , pregnancy outcome consequent neonatal mortality measure among woman identify pregnant surveillance followed-up 42-60 day delivery . The period data collection objective 12-24 month . Sample Size Estimates Maternal mortality , stillbirth rate neonatal mortality estimate pregnant woman , mother newborns time site meet minimum criterion inclusion . The verbal autopsy fill retrospectively window period 1 year death woman still birth . Verbal autopsy neonatal death already fill parent study . METHODOLOGY Description study site : The parent study , Neonatal Vitamin A supplementation trial , conduct 16 cluster , 13 catchment area Primary Health Centres Faridabad Palwal district state Haryana 3 urban slum cluster Faridabad district . Study Procedures Active surveillance conduct identify pregnancy death among woman reproductive age population 3 monthly home visitation . At time identification pregnancy , information record detail pregnancy include last menstrual period . For woman whose infant enrol study , information vital status mother obtain 3 monthly follow visit pregnancy surveillance register retrospectively well prospectively infant whose 3 month follow visit still due . For woman whose infant enrol due exclusion criterion woman still births abortion , visit make 42 60 day record information vital status woman . Miscarriages/abortions , stillbirth , live birth , neonatal death maternal death record . Verbal autopsy conduct death woman reproductive age , include died pregnancy , childbirth 42-60 day childbirth still births neonatla death . Sites use standardized verbal autopsy questionnaire . Specially trained worker conduct verbal autopsy within 3 month report death . For death already report since initiation parent study , verbal autopsy do within 12 month death ( WHO verbal autopsy standard , 2007 ) . The verbal autopsy instrument pre-tested use extensively many setting . Nevertheless , site translate questionnaire pretest ensure translate question capture intend information . Any change base pre-tests make prior implementation . Safety Considerations This observational study pregnant woman identify followed end postnatal period identify stillbirths maternal neonatal death part parent study . A verbal autopsy interview conduct death . There direct safety concern . Ethical Considerations Ethical approval obtain WHO SAS ERC . Informed Consent Informed consent already request household conduct reproductive surveillance order identify pregnant woman periodic follow . This consent verbal inform consent form sign member research team obtain consent confirm he/she accurately read consent form potential participant/head household , individual opportunity ask question consent freely . The informed consent form verbal autopsy confirm signature thumbprint participant . In absence signature , witness ( member research team obtain consent ) ask sign counter sign member research team obtain consent . Confidentiality All identifier information delinked identifier information store lock key analysis complete . Data Management Information core set variable collect standard definition use across site . The WHO provide set range consistency check must apply variable , although exact procedure use carry check leave individual site . Electronic data capture double data entry separate data entry specialist perform onsite . Alternatively , scan form use special TeleForms software perform . The site responsible initial cleaning data , include run range consistency check well periodic review distribution identification outlier . The study site resolve inconsistency within database consultation field data collection team field verification need . Data core set variable study site send every 3 month central data repository establish project WHO . The WHO team run another set range consistency check include check consistency data quality across site . Any inconsistency query provide study site , expect check address list query resubmit data . Cleaned data site pool stored SQL database WHO . Statistical Analysis All verbal autopsy analyze use reliable valid computer-based method include Random Forests , Inter-VA Tariff method . The site conduct analysis verbal autopsy data order determine cause deaths stillbirth neonatal maternal death . A data analysis workshop hold WHO Geneva second quarter 2014 conduct pool analysis data . Quality Assurance Principal investigator provide monthly progress report entire study period participate regular telephone conference WHO staff . Field supervisor check form complete field worker data entry . Field supervisor observe 5 % randomly select field worker verbal autopsy . Data cleaning quality assurance perform use consistency range check study site WHO data coordination centre describe data management section . The WHO Department Maternal , Newborn , Child Adolescent Health responsible monitoring study collaboration select site investigator . WHO staff and/or site investigator perform site monitoring visit site least every 6 month assess quality study implementation data collection use standardized site monitoring checklist . The site visit lead provision recommendation study improvement . More intensive visit plan first six month study implementation ensure prompt problem identification resolution .</detailed_description>
