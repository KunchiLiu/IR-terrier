	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize control trial compare traditional air insufflation water immersion water exchange patient undergo colonoscopy use demand sedation . We test hypothesis compare air insufflation proportion patient require demand sedation colonoscopy significantly lower water immersion water exchange , water exchange produce great reduction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Water Exchange , Water Immersion Air Insufflation Methods During Colonoscopy With Option Demand Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient allocate 3 group computerized randomization . In group A ( water exchange ) , water infuse remove time throughout entire colon insertion phase air pump turn . In group B ( water immersion ) , water infused insertion phase remove withdrawal phase . The water use mainly open lumen , without attempt clear colon content . In group A B , warm-to-touch water infuse mainly infused accessory channel colonoscope use foot-switch controlled water pump ( JW2 , Fujinon , Saitama , Japan ) . Air insufflation use cecum reach . . In group C , air insufflation use throughout procedure . Aliquots 30 50 ml water use wash residual stool , need . In three group , loop reduction maneuver , abdominal compression change patient position utilized discretion colonoscopist record . Intubation cecum define successful base cecum touch tip colonoscope . Detailed examination undertake withdrawal phase . During colonoscopy , study nurse ask patient report level pain ( 0 = none , 10 = severe ) 2 3-minute interval time patient voice discomfort . For pain score â‰§2 , maneuver minimize pain implement . Immediately thereafter , nurse offer sedation , patient accept decline . If accept , initial bolus 1 mg/kg 0.5 mg/kg patient 65 year propofol ( Diprivan , Astra-Zeneca , Stockholm , Sweden ) titrate 20- 30-mg increment achieve adequate level sedation . The need additional drug estimate patient pain response ( moan , grimace movement ) . Usually propofol added withdrawal phase . The initial amount propofol , arrival cecum record . The following parameter evaluate recorded patient data sheet : quality bowel preparation , cecal intubation time , withdrawal time total procedure time , use abdominal pressure , need change position , presence polyp reason incomplete colonoscopy . The procedure record stored digital file .</detailed_description>
