	<brief_summary>The study compare two different operative technique placement Cochlear Bi300 implant use bone anchor hearing aid . The operative technique compare - Dermatome technique soft tissue reduction - Linear incision minimal soft tissue reduction The hypothesis operative technique comparable regard implant stability , soft tissue heal loss sensibility around implant . To evaluate evolution implant stability early healing period implantation , critical period osseointegrated implant , particular early loading protocol use . To compare soft tissue heal around Baha implant place accord recommended surgical technique skin transplant Baha implant without perform skin reduction . To compare loss sensibility skin around Baha implant ( loss cutaneous sensibility nerve transplant procedure ) two surgical procedure . While study focus early healing period ( 3 month ) , long-term safety data also collect 6 month 1-year . The study also evaluate change health status produce surgical intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Two Surgical Techniques Soft Tissue Healing Implant Stability Cochlear BI300 Implants .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND Implant stability Until recently , implant use Baha surgery exclusively standard Brånemark type titanium implant as-machined surface finish . The recommended procedure Baha implantation machine titanium implant use 12-week heal period load implant sound processor , order allow sufficient time implant become integrated bone . The new Cochlear Baha BI300 Series implant design improve implant stability placement time , thus make possible reduce time sound processor fitting . The implant feature wider diameter compare previous generation Baha implant , small-sized thread cylindrical portion implant underneath flange , roughen implant surface . Six-month data multi-centre clinical investigation compare new implant previous generation Baha implant use 6-week loading protocol , show significantly high Implant Stability Quotient ( ISQ ) value ( measure resonance frequency analysis ) new implant time point , reduction stability loading.1 The data study suggest implant stability achieve 6 week implantation sufficient support sound processor . The data also suggest reduction time sound processor fitting may possible , provide favourable bone condition implant site provide satisfactory soft tissue status time load . Hence , clinical investigation implant load 21 day post-surgery initiated team Nijmegen , 6-month data investigation confirm safe attach sound processor 3 weeks.2 Early result two study use load time 4 weeks3 2 weeks4 , respectively , also present show good outcome . All study perform patient good bone quality . Soft tissue management The recommended procedure Baha implantation advocate hair free transplant measure 25 x 25 mm place direct periosteum . The purpose obtain immobile skin , hence reduce risk adverse skin reaction area . Since weak adherence titanium abutment surround soft tissue anticipate , skin reduction perform , epidermal downgrowth pocket formation may occur time , increase risk infection implant area . The current surgical procedure , skin transplant , use three decade proven safe ; however , skin complication still occur account majority report complication Baha implant . Some surgeon hypothesise equally good good result may achieve soft tissue leave intact . However , clinical evidence still remain scarce systematic follow-up lacking . To investigator knowledge , publication specifically focus alternative surgical technique without soft tissue thin limited study Dr. Hultcrantz compare outcomes seven patient undergoing Baha surgery traditional surgical technique ( skin thinning ) seven patient alternative technique ( without skin thinning ) .5 The outcome study promise , clinical data necessary establish whether surgical technique safe efficacious . 2 . OBJECTIVES To evaluate evolution implant stability early healing period implantation , critical period osseointegrated implant , particular early loading protocol use . To compare soft tissue heal around Baha implant place accord recommended surgical technique skin transplant Baha implant without perform skin reduction . To compare loss sensibility skin around Baha implant ( loss cutaneous sensibility nerve transplant procedure ) two surgical procedure . While study focus early healing period ( 3 month ) , long-term safety data also collect 6 month 1-year . The study also evaluate change health status produce surgical intervention . 6 . IMPLANT DEVICE The following CE mark implant pre-mounted abutment shall use ( MDD Class IIb medical device , manufacturer : Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions AB , Mölnlycke , Sweden ) : • Cochlear Baha BIA300 Implant 4 mm Abutment 9 mm ( Article # 92346 ) Note : The 9 mm abutment use treatment group ( without skin transplant ) order able compare result resonance frequency analysis ( implant stability ) early heal period . When appropriate , patient skin reduction 9 mm abutment exchange 6 mm abutment ( Article # 92130 ) 3-month data collect . No surgery need order exchange 9 mm abutment 6 mm abutment . 7 . TREATMENT Implantation use Baha system ( hear device/implant system ) . The implant shall place accord procedure FAST ( one-stage ) surgery . All patient receive treatment , thus placebo control group use . 8 . METHOD This evaluation perform one site . Implants place one-stage surgical procedure . Sound processor fit perform 2 week implant installation , discretion investigator . The decision load implant base assessment implant stability status soft tissue . Patients evaluate ready load 2 week surgery load soon heal sufficient . Patients include study randomise two different treatment group patient one group soft tissue remove split skin ( harvest dermatome ) use cover periosteum around abutment per recommended procedure manufacturer , patient group soft tissue remove ( linear incision technique use ) . If subcutaneous tissue thickness possible use 9 mm abutment , minimal removal subcutaneous tissue superficial fascia perform . The risk treatment two treatment group : bleed per- postoperatively , wound infection damage surround tissue include sensory nerve scalp loss implant . These risk well know risk know treatment . The new surgical procedure introduce new risk . The change health status produce surgical intervention evaluate Glasgow Benefit Inventory 3 month surgery .</detailed_description>
