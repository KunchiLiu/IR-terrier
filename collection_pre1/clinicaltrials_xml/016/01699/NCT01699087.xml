	<brief_title>A Safety Effectiveness Study PRK Using ALLEGRETTO WAVE® EYE-Q Excimer Laser System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , single group study . Subjects underwent bilateral PRK second eye treat sooner 1 week later 30 day first eye 's PRK treatment . Subjects follow 2 year surgery . The protocol underwent 4 amendment . The key difference protocol version clarification plan analysis adverse event reporting procedure . There change inclusion exclusion criterion non-adverse event relate study assessment protocol version 1-5 . Refractive stability manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) manifest refractive cylinder define establish : - At least 95 % treated eye change ≤ 1.0 diopter manifest refraction perform 2 manifest refraction least 3 month apart - The mean rate change , determine paired analysis , ≤ 0.5 diopter per year ( 0.04 D/month ) time period - The mean rate change decrease monotonically time , project asymptote zero rate change attributable normal age - The 95 % confidence interval mean rate change include zero rate change attributable normal age . Refractive stability assess pair visit within interval define occur latter time point first interval stability achieve . In final amendment protocol , 3 secondary objective make co-primary response Agency comment . All endpoint analysis modify match .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects desire refractive correction myopia 6.00 Diopter ( D ) sphere without astigmatism 0 3.00 D 6.00 D manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) spectacle plane measure manifest refraction ; Minimum best spectacle correct visual acuity ( BSCVA ) treat eye 20/25 ; Uncorrected visual acuity ( UCVA ) 20/40 worse treat eye ; Less 0.75 D spherical equivalent ( SE ) difference cycloplegic manifest refraction ; Stable refraction ( within ± 0.5 D ) , determine MRSE minimum 12 month prior surgery ; Demonstrated stable refraction contact lens wearer , specify protocol ; Signed informed consent document ; Willing able comply schedule followup visit ; Other protocoldefined inclusion criterion may apply . Exclusion Criteria Females pregnant , lactate , plan pregnancy time course study , another condition associate fluctuation hormone could lead refractive change ; Participation clinical trial study ; Acute chronic disease illness would increase operative risk confound outcome study ; Dry eye syndrome determine short questionnaire dry eye syndrome ; Systemic medication may confound outcome study increase risk subject affect wound heal tissue repair , include , limited steroid , antimetabolite , immune response modify drug , etc . ; Nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze PRK treatment diagnostic test ; Ocular condition may predispose subject future complication ; Previous intraocular corneal surgery ; Subjects desire monovision ; A known sensitivity medication use study procedure , include PRK ; Presence history condition find make subject unsuitable candidate PRK study participation may confound outcome study , opinion Investigator ; Other protocoldefined exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
