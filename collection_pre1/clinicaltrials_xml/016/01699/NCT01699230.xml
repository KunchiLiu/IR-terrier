	<brief_title>Potential Effects Omega 3 Supplementation Cardiomyocytes Membranes Patients With Coronary Atherosclerosis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very human data currently available fatty acid composition cardiomyocytes membrane . Preoperative omega-3 supplementation patient undergoing cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass correlate decreased frequency postoperative complication type arrhythmia atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation common complication : 30 50 % myocardial revascularization . The occurrence atrial fibrillation increase morbidity mortality surgery sure . The pathophysiological mechanism common atrial fibrillation treat heart rhythm unit different postoperative atrial fibrillation . Indeed , atrial fibrillation common disease primarily leave atrium , although atrial fibrillation cardiac surgery multifactorial disease implication various pathogen inflammation without precise anatomical support . The preventive use polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-3 long-chain ( LC-AGPIÏ‰3 ) , prior cardiac surgery far widespread due Lack information dissemination , insufficient number publish study , despite existence number ongoing clinical trial complete ignorance biological mechanisms action . A human clinical study need . In context cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass without deleterious side effect preoperative enrichment omega-3 , seem appropriate conduct feasibility study provide information structural change membrane cardiomyocytes .</detailed_description>
