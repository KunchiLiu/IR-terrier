Twenty healthy men woman tobacco smoker twenty healthy nonsmoker recruit . Each subject participate 1 MRI 2 [ 11C ] PHNO PET scan . On study day subject participate two [ 11C ] PHNO scan ( ideally , two PET scan carry day ) . Three hour second PET scan , amphetamine ( 0.5 mg/kg , PO ) administer . In smoker , scan occur 10-21 day smoke abstinence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine amphetamine-induced DA release tobacco smoker currently smoke acute withdrawal nonsmoker . Twenty healthy men woman tobacco smoker twenty healthy nonsmoker recruit . Each subject participate 1 MRI 2 [ 11C ] PHNO PET scan . On PET study day subject participate two [ 11C ] PHNO scan ( ideally , two PET scan carry day ) . Three hour second PET scan , amphetamine ( 0.5 mg/kg , PO ) administer . In smoker , set scan occur 10-21 day smoke abstinence . Smoking abstinence determine carbon monoxide urine cotinine ( breakdown product nicotine cigarette smoke ) level . Subjects ask breathe breathalyzer measure carbon monoxide provide urine sample measure cotinine . Smoking abstinence confirm carbon monoxide cotinine level reduce compare actively smoke . We hypothesize smoker 10-21 day withdrawal amphetamine-induced DA release blunt compare healthy nonsmoker . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ( 3 T ) collect subject co-register PET MRI image analysis . Within two week PET study , MRI acquire Yale University MRI Center . Subjects take ferromagnetic metal detector enter scan room . The acquisition sequence 3D fast spoil grass ( FSPGR ) MR pulse sequence IR prep 300 ms. ( TE= 3.3 m , flip angle=17 degree ; slice thickness= 1.2 mm ) optimize delineate gray matter/white matter/CSF boundary . The small voxel size ( 0.93 X 1.2 X 0.93 mm ) provide high-resolution volumetric image . MR image provide match anatomical atlas create individualized region-of-interest template subject . Subject preparation consist two intravenous ( IV ) catheterization immobilization head . PET scan acquire subject rest use HRRT PET scanner ( 207 slice , resolution well 3 mm FWHM ) . This resolution permit visualization PHNO raclopride uptake ventral/dorsal striatum , globus pallidus ( GP ) substantia nigra ( SN ) . A transmission scan use orbit 137Cs point-source obtain emission scan . Motion correction perform dynamically measurement Vicra ( NDI Systems , Waterloo , Ontario ) use dedicate list-mode reconstruction algorithm .</detailed_description>
