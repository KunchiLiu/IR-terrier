	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma . Patients must meet one follow indication treatment : 1 . Progressive disease mark splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy . 2 . Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11 mg/dL ) thrombocytopenia ( platelet &lt; 100,000/μL ) . 3 . Unexplained weight loss exceed 10 % body weight previous 6 month . 4 . CTCAE Grade 2 3 fatigue . 5 . Fevers &gt; 100.5º F night sweat 2 week without evidence infection . 6 . Progressive lymphocytosis , increase exceed 50 % 2 month period double time le 6 month . 7 . Need cytoreduction prior allogeneic stem cell transplant . Patients must relapse refractory disease ≥1 prior line treatment . The interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 5 halflives cytotoxic noncytotoxic agent . Lowdose corticosteroid ( prednisone &lt; 20 mg/ day equivalent dose ) permit throughout study . Clinically significant toxicity prior chemotherapy must resolve Grade ≤ 1 . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/μL absence bone marrow involvement platelet ≥30,000/μL absence bone marrow involvement If patient extensive bone marrow involvement , minimum ANC platelet level require . total bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional ULN unless due Gilbert 's syndrome , control autoimmune hemolytic anemia immune thrombocytopenia AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN unless due disease creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Negative serum urine pregnancy test time first dose WOCBP . Ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent authorization use disclosure protect health information , agree abide study restriction return required assessment . Ability take oral medication . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event ( CTCAE Grade &gt; 1 ) due agent administer 3 week earlier . Patients receive prior treatment CDK inhibitor within 12 month study enrollment . Highdose corticosteroid ( prednisone ≥20mg/day equivalent dose ) must discontinue ≥ 7 day initiate therapy . Patients known central nervous system involvement . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition TG02 citrate . Patients G6PD deficiency .
