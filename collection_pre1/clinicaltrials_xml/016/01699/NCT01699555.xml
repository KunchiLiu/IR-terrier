	<detailed_description>Scientific research show expression gene virus integrated Human genetic material , Multiple Sclerosis associate RetroVirus ( MSRV ) could play critical role causation multiple sclerosis . GNbAC1 experimental medication , neutralizes ( i.e . inactivates ) protein MSRV might contribute development deterioration multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>

Blood pressure pulse measure 3 minute rest sit position . Body mass index 18.5 30.0 kg/m2 body weight 50 95 kg range . No need regular concomitant medication Subjects partner childbearing potential use adequate contraception , least four week administration study medication . Adequate contraception define usage least one partner barrier method contraception , together usage female partner , commence least three month prior Screening , stable regimen form hormonal contraception intrauterine device . Use abstinence alone consider adequate . Use barrier method alone consider adequate subject vasectomize least six month prior Screening . Ability communicate well investigator comply requirement entire study . The subject give write consent participate study . History serious adverse reaction hypersensitivity drug . Presence history allergy require acute chronic treatment ( seasonal allergic rhinitis require treatment may tolerate ) . Abnormal physical finding clinical significance Screening baseline examination would interfere objective study . Need prescription medication within 30 day prior administration drug and/or nonprescription medication within 7 day prior administration drug anticipate need concomitant medication study . Participation clinical trial previous 4 week , i.e . completion previous trial plan first administration current trial . Loss 500 mL blood 3 month period screen visit study , e.g . donor . Existence surgical medical condition might relevantly interfere subject safety , distribution , metabolism excretion drug study assessment , i.e . impaired renal hepatic function , diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular abnormality , chronic symptom pronounce constipation diarrhea condition associate total partial obstruction urinary tract . Symptoms significant ( upon Investigator 's medical judgment ) somatic mental illness two week period precede drug administration . History clinical evidence significant cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , hematological , neurologic disease . History hepatitis B / C / positive serology result indicate presence hepatitis B / C. Positive result HIV serology . Positive MSRV env RNA PCR Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value ( determine Principal Investigator consultation sponsor ) Screening baseline evaluation . History serious mental disorder . History alcohol drug abuse last 3 year . Heavy smoker , i.e . 10 cigarette per day and/or unwillingness refrain smoking entire inhouse period . Positive result drug Screening . Need vaccination Screening End Study</criteria>
