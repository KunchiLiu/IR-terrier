	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : STAN monitoring reduce number intervention suspect fetal asphyxia reduce number newborn metabolic acidosis . Primary endpoint : 1 ) Frequency metabolic acidosis two group , define pH umbilical cord artery &lt; 7.05 standard base excess &lt; -10 . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Number intervention ( VE caesarean section ) two group 2 . Number pH measurement two group 3 . Number neonates admitted neonatal department suspect asphyxia two group The aim fetal surveillance identify fetus risk develop damage newborn term long term damage cause lack oxygen birth process . Approximately 1/10 case paralysis due brain damage ( cerebral palsy ) believe caused lack oxygen birth . These avoid investigator intervene actively birth damage occurs . CardioTocoGraphy ( CTG = detection fetal heart rate pattern maternal uterine contraction via electrode maternal abdomen fetal scalp ) widely use method fetal surveillance . However , difficult interpret CTG , uncertainty CTG interpretation may therefore lead increase number delivery vacuum suction caesarean section . Interpretation CTG improve analyze acidity blood sample take skin fetal scalp . Such scalp pH analysis show indirectly fetus get enough oxygen . Scalp pH measurement require expertise require repeat measurement abnormal heart rate pattern persist . This method normal routine maternity ward Hvidovre Hospital / Roskilde County Hospital . The problem seem partially alleviate use newly develop method fetal surveillance call STAN ( ST analysis ) . By STAN continuously record CTG fetal ECG ( electrocardiography = record electrical heart activity ) . Simultaneously analyze portion fetal ECG , namely ST-part hypoxia lead change . The technique easy use , since require one electrode fetal scalp place way ordinary CTG registration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The value STAN ( ST analysis ) assess 2 randomized trial show : 1 ) A reduction incidence severe hypoxia fetus labor 2 ) A reduction frequency redemption suction caesarean section due lack oxygen birth process . Within last year however , substantial new information regard . STAN . The Swedish Social Board publish newsletter ( 17 ) describe possible risk birth asphyxiate child , die others cerebral palsy . A new Finnish study ( 18 ) suggest may increase risk ( moderate ) acidosis use STAN . The led considerable debate , Sweden also throughout Europe . This lead Swedish , Danish ( Newsletter 1 , Annex 1b ) common Nordic reference group STAN orally announce new clinical guideline STAN application . A recently hold workshop Utrecht , Holland generate joint European guideline , seek publish . Against background necessary develop new guideline complement scalp pH STAN arm project ( Annex 1a ) Common study consistently apply scalp pH STAN monitoring begin . It therefore important elucidate whether , use STAN monitoring need ( 1 ) FBS - extent FBS require . STAN method currently win widespread Denmark internationally ( FDA approve ) , notwithstanding scientifically proven fetal monitoring STAN well current monitoring method scalp pH measurement . It therefore important get resolve randomize study relative expensive STAN apparatus introduce several place Denmark . This study provide opportunity highlight issue prepare way use STAN prevent significantly reduce risk thus justify continued STAN use continue spread STAN advise . If STAN method prove comparable clean scalp pH measurement adjunct CTG , significant advance fetal monitoring technology , take thus primarily non-invasive , safe continuous method cause less inconvenience mother child . The study approve Ethical nominee director . The study include woman &gt; 18 year labour fetus cephalic presentation gestational age 36 week + 0 , monitor CTG . Women develop CTG change interpret abnormal ( accord STAN ( FIGO ) -guidelines scalp pH normal , could include study . Women randomise telephone ( electronic ) surveillance eighter STAN monitoring CTG scalp pH . In latter group STAN result blind ( hide ) later analysis . There estimated 1200 woman study study expect run 2-3 year , precede pilotproject . During pilot project follow department 's usual procedure monitoring , CTG use STAN device blinded/concealed ST analysis . There expect 100 patient pilotproject . The aim investigate whether calculation survey stick simultaneously train staff maternity ward STAN equipment procedure make familiar work . The advantage conduct study maternity ward Hvidovre hospital large birthplace Denmark nearly 6,000 birth annually , perhaps high use scalp pH measurement labor . In addition , nearly 3,000 birth annually Roskilde County Hospital , total 9,500 birth . In addition , department project manager areexperienced scientific study fetal monitoring . Project participant initiative , initiated project financial interest instrument company produce use equipment/ appliances/ monitor . The project allocate 2.5 million DKr funding project Elsass Foundation , private foundation financial interest project equipment/ appliances/ monitor .</detailed_description>
