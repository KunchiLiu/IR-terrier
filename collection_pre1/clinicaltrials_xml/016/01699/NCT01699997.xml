	<brief_summary>Background : A large body research show Oxytocin ( OXT ) important prosocial peptide also initial evidence central OXT system alter several mental disorder characterize severe social disturbance deficit , anxiety disorder prominent social dysfunction ( e.g. , schizophrenia ) , mood disorder borderline personality disorder . OXT may reduce psychotic symptom may diminish certain social cognition deficit improve current antipsychotic medication . Aims : The project two main aim , list : 1 . To assess efficacy intranasal OXT reduce negative symptom patient schizophrenia association second-generation antipsychotic ( SGA ) ; 2 . To use Emotional Priming Paradigm task assess pre- post-treatment change patient general cognitive emotional status . Study Design : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross design . Materials method : Patients involve study recruit six centre north Italy . Each subject ( age 18-45 , duration disorder longer 10 year ) enrol screen phase . 80 patient randomly assign either 40 IU OXT daily vehicle placebo , addition pre-study antipsychotic medication regimen : reasonable attempt maintain SGA dosage throughout study make . The study ratio 1:1 . The total study duration individual subject approximately 8 month , include 7-day screening period , baseline randomization visit , four month long cross-over treatment period . Subjects train researcher self-administration intranasal OXT . A trustworthy caregiver train well . Each patient receive every morning SMS text message mobile phone reminder OXT administration . Before start treatment , patient assess standardized assessment instrument undergo depth neuropsychological assessment ; additional evaluation , include safety evaluation , perform 4 8 month follow-up . The primary outcome measure negative score Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) perform 2,4,6 8 month since start treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project two main aim : 1 . Aims cross-over study To assess efficacy intranasal OXT reduce negative symptom patient SZ ( evaluate PANSS ) , association standard Second Generation Antipsychotics ( SGA ) treatment ; recruit patient age 18-45 year disorder duration longer 10 year . 2 . Aims neuropsychological assessment To use Emotional Priming Paradigm ( EPP ) task assess pre- post-treatment change patient general cognitive emotional status . The investigator aim treat large sample size patient schizophrenia , consist exclusively patient limited disorder duration rather young age , sufficiently long period time . Our rationale employ longer treatment period use previous on-going trial ascertain possibility positive OXT dose-response relationship , would observable , however , longer treatment exposure . Moreover , patient disorder onset 10 year less enrol . They standardize term AP treatment randomize OXT placebo 8 month . OXT hormone naturally present human body , recent study suggest patient SZ show low level neuropeptide . It therefore hypothesize treatment propose project might balance apparently low OXT level patient . Finally , another innovative aspect project attention ameliorate patient adherence treatment support reminder program ( automatic SMS send every morning remind patient daily OXT self-administration ) involve trustworthy caregiver train OXT administration ask monitor patient compliance record self-administration write form .</detailed_description>
