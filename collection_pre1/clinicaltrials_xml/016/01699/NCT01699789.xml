	<detailed_description>Underserved community color low income , largely ethnic-minority neighborhood face excessive burden illness depression due high prevalence depression low access quality care . Evidence-based quality improvement ( QI ) program depression primary care settings—where many low-income minority patient receive mental health care—can enhance quality depression care improve health outcome . These program under-utilized community-based health care setting , adapt use across diverse agency ( social service , faith base , primary specialty care ) could partner support disease management depression . Partners Care ( PIC ) WE Care intervention design improve access evidence-based depression treatment ( medication management psychotherapy ) primary care patient , WE Care , social service client . PIC evaluate service delivery intervention WE Care effectiveness trial study-provided treatment . Both study promote use evidence-based treatment . Both PIC WE Care program improve use evidence-based treatment depression health outcome African Americans Latinos . The PIC intervention reduce health outcome disparity evident usual care first follow-up year five-year follow-up . While finding offer hope underserved community , community poor resource support implementation program , may historical distrust research health care setting . There evidence-based approach support agency network underserved community implement QI program depression . To address information gap , investigator create Community Partners Care ( CPIC ) , group-level randomized , control trial , randomization level agency site `` unit . '' The trial field two underserved community , Hollywood South Los Angeles , conduct community- participatory , partner research ( CPPR ) approach . The specific aim study : 1 . To engage two underserved community improve safety-net care depression . 2 . To examine effect community-engagement approach implement evidence-based depression quality improvement toolkits ( PIC/WE Care ) community collaborative network across service sector , compare technical assistance individual program service sector couple culturally-competent outreach implement toolkits . The outcome : ) client access care , quality care health outcome , primary outcome mental-health relate quality life additional outcome reflect social determinant mental health interest community ( physical health , homelessness risk factor , employment ) ; b ) service utilization cost ; c ) agency adoption PIC/WE Care ; ) provider attitude , knowledge practice . 3 . To describe process implementation community engagement intervention . CPIC award fund Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) 2013 accomplish follow 3 aim : 1 . To compare long-term ( 3-year ) effectiveness community engagement plan versus agency technical assistance implement depression QI improve depressed client ' health status risk homelessness 2 . To determine depressed client under-resourced community prioritize diverse health social outcome identify preference service address priority outcomes 3 . To identify capacity provider respond depressed client ' priority generate recommendation build capacity well address clients'priorities . We hypothesize community engagement plan effective technical assistance improve 3-year outcome client prioritize quality life . We expect find gaps provider capacity address client priority network strategy could address . Our primary outcome long-term follow-up mental health relate quality life secondary outcome use healthcare community service depression physical functioning homeless risk factor . In 2014 , CPIC award fund National Institute Minority Health Health Disparities ( NIMHD ) use exist quantitative CPIC data collect new qualitative data describe pathway reduce disparity . The funding allow u longitudinally track implementation CEP model new county-wide initiative develop community network promote healthy neighborhood . The aims additional funding : 1 . To determine pathway reduce mental health social disparity conduct community-academic partnered analysis CPIC data 1 ) examine intervention effect disparity subgroup ( African Americans , Latinos , gender group , insurance housing status group ) ; 2 ) identifying predictor mediator barrier access/services client outcome ; 3 ) analyze intervention effect provider workforce diversity ; 4 ) generate explanatory model intervention effect sustainability interview CPIC administrator provider , well prior current client . 2 . To explore generalizability replicability CPIC partner model , broadly , inform process incorporate science policy conduct longitudinal case study CEP model implementation county-wide `` neighborhood health '' initiative Los Angeles reduce mental health social disparity . As result study , able explain community-engaged participatory model intervention implementation reduce health social disparity ultimately achieve public health impact . Study finding disseminate widely use traditional academic , community-valued , policy-relevant dissemination channel .</detailed_description>
