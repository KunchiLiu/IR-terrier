	<brief_title>Effectiveness Educational Video Following Acute Whiplash Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whiplash injury affect 1-3 per 1000 inhabitant year ( Jansen et al . 2008 ) . Most patient experience transitory neck complaint recover within week . However , estimate 10 % develop severe persistent pain seriously affect long term well-being work ability . The exact mechanism behind variation recovery remain elusive , knowledge prevent transition acute chronic neck pain sparse . Guidelines management acute whiplash emphasize importance patient information , limited evidence information provide order improve recovery . Nevertheless , recent study indicate patient education video may beneficial method improve early management neck pain ( Oliveira et al . 2006 , Brison et al . 2005 ) . Using randomize controlled design study aim determine efficacy educational video concern whiplash injury comparison active comparator condition consist relaxation video . The anticipated study population 300 consecutive patient acute neck complaint follow motor vehicle accident recruit two major Emergency Departments Denmark . Following completion standard care emergency room , patient give consent participate randomize either intervention ( educational video ) comparison group ( relaxation video ) . Randomization achieve emergency room staff hand sequentially number , seal envelope , prepare Research Clinic Functional Disorders Psychosomatics . The randomization list computer-generated block 20 stratify accord place treatment ( participate emergency ward ) . The envelope contain letter personal code give participant access secure website view video home . The educational video explain nature whiplash injury provide biopsychosocial model neck pain incorporate physiological cognitive-behavioural aspect , reassurance basic advice pain relief . The comparison condition relaxation video detail simple relaxation exercise breathe exercise safely use whiplash patient . The relaxation video contain explanatory information concern whiplash injury relate symptom . The participant follow 12 month visit emergency room . Self-report data obtain questionnaire 1-week , 3- 12-month follow-up . Data health care use absence work due illness retrieve public register throughout follow-up period . The study approve The Central Region Committees Biomedical Research Ethics , Denmark Danish Data Protection Agency . The project fund single grant Tryg Foundation , Denmark . The transition acute chronic pain whiplash trauma pose threat well-being individual well lead extensive health care cost loss work day ( Leth-Petersen &amp; Rotger 2009 , Holm et al . 1999 ) . The development cost-effective preventive intervention add usual treatment early stage whiplash associate disorder could potentially contribute reduce suffer patient financial cost society . This study hopefully contribute development effective evidence-based treatment whiplash associate disorder . In long term , study may also aid development patient education patient group risk develop chronic disorder .</detailed_description>
