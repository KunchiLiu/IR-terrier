Celiac patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome consider eligible inclusion . They 18 65 year old GFD least 2 year . Will exclude study patient previous abdominal surgery , chronic disease , alarm sign organic condition , treatment probiotic , prebiotics , antibiotic antispasmodic previous month , immunodeficiency , pregnancy . The size sample , must show benefit great 25 % compare placebo ( untreated group usually able respond positive 20 % case ) , require 58 patient per arm ensure power 90 % alpha error 0.5 . Patient assign consecutive number , start low number available , randomly assign , use computer generate randomisation list use permuted block design , receive orally either probiotic mixture Lactobacillus plantarum 14D-CECT 4528 , Lactobacillus casei , Bifidobacterium breve Bbr8 LMG P-17501 , Bifidobacterium breve Bl10 LMG P-17500 Bifidobacterium animalis placebo ( sachet identical taste appearance active study product except absence probiotic mixture ) day . The study consist three phase : 1. phase `` running-in '' two week reduce possibility next significant placebo effect patient take product ; 2. supplementation 6 week patient take one packet per day placebo active product ; 3. follow-up 6 week . Enrolled patient enter sequentially receive assign treatment . Boxes contain placebo shape , dimension , indication appearance contain viable probiotic mixture provide probiotic producer ( Moviscom Srl , Rome , Italy ) ensure study blind investigator patient . Group assignment concealed participant investigator . During duration trial ( w1- w14 ) patient record gastrointestinal symptom weekly diary . During time compile , every two week , Gastrointestinal symptom rating score ( GSRS ) , consist 15-point questionnaire ass severity frequency symptom validate Svedlund et al.. For patient collect , T = 0 T = 42 day , stool sample perform extraction DNA RNA possible assessment intestinal microflora . Bacteria DNA stool extract stored -80Â°C future analysis . At end study , patient achieve primary objective make specific identification intestinal microflora verify amendment . The compliance study demonstrate accord number sachet consume patient 6 week administration , basis compilation questionnaire provide protocol . Outcome Measures Primary outcome incidence IBS celiac patient receive probiotic compare receive placebo . We choose pain primary outcome measure , line propose points-to-consider IBS trial . IBS diagnose categorise accord ROME III criterion . Secondary outcome : 1 ) evaluation frequency/severity symptom accord treatment arm ; 2 ) modification intestinal microbiota . The analysis intestinal microbiota informative case help assess whether intestinal microbiota suggestive future inset IBS ability probiotic mixture stabilize intestinal microbiota .
