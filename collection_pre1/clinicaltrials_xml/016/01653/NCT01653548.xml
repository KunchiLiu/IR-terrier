	<brief_title>Evaluating Novel Method Generalizing Emotion Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Difficulties regulate emotional arousal skillful manner common across many psychiatric disorder may central severe difficult-to-treat population ( e.g. , borderline personality disorder ) . To immediately decrease negative affect , individual difficulty regulate negative emotion often rely maladaptive behavior significant public health problem , include substance use , suicidal behavior , binging/purging , negatively reinforce behavior . Conventional approach generalization emotion regulation skill outside clinic ( e.g. , assign therapy homework ) insufficient . New intervention need directly immediately reduce acute negative emotion rely patient compliance homework assignment top-down approach . Accordingly , primary aim project evaluate whether novel habituation reminder ( HRs ) introduce follow personally-relevant emotional stressor reduce acute negative emotion psychological distress outside original learn context . Using team basic applied scientist , 4 year investigator recruit 420 adult outpatient enroll 250 participant extreme difficulty emotion regulation participate 3 experiment . Actual enrollment : 372 adult outpatient sign consent enrol study . 222 participant eligible begin study . Out 222 , 210 complete study ( oppose desire 250 ) . Before recruited study , potential participant complete phone screenâ€”a pre-experiment screening questionnaire online questionnaire ass certain exclusion inclusion criterion . Eligible participant invite study office provide write informed consent receive clinical assessment , full inclusion exclusion criterion assess . Using method develop Pitman colleague use study adult PTSD , BPD , diagnose , investigator create four negative emotional arousal script use random order Exp . 1 . In brief , Clinical Assessor ask participant describe five recent ( i.e. , past two week ) moderate stressor life . Participants write description event , clinical assessor work participant establish clear story event recite approximately 30 second . The assessor review script , ask clarification , ask participant rank least stressful . Following assessment , clinical assessor sex experimenter digitally record script .mp3 file , use random order emotional stressor Exp . 1 . Experiment 1 -Design-In Exp . 1 , investigator use 2 ( Learning Phase : HR v. No HR ) X 2 ( Testing Phase : Context v. different ) X 2 ( Testing Phase : HR v. No HR ) between-subjects factorial design . Randomization-All participant randomize condition , oversampling HR group , use urn randomization procedure off-site study statistician . Urn randomization conduct use age gender match variable . Learning Phase ( Day 1 ) Baseline-First , baseline subjective unit general psychological distress ( SUDS ; visual analogue scale 0-100 ) emotional arousal assess use self-reported psychophysiological ( galvanic skin response ) measure . The Study Coordinator affix electrode use standard procedure , use Biopac MP150 hardware AcKnowledge software data acquisition . The galvanic skin response device test safety efficacy study , use diagnostic device . Participants complete five-minute baseline , sit comfortable chair quietly without sleep temperature control , sound attenuate room . SUDS self-reported baseline emotion ( SAM ) obtain end baseline . Next , emotional stressor task administer participant play stressful script create clinical assessment . Prior hear script , participant instruct listen carefully attempt imagine event vividly possible . The task proceeds follow : ( 1 ) stressor heard via headphone ( 30 ) , ( 2 ) participant instruct via standardized instruction imagine vividly possible stressful experience ( 30 ) , ( 3 ) silence ( 30 ) , ( 3 ) self-report emotional arousal valence ( SAM ; 30 ) obtain via computer . This sequence repeat minimum two maximum four time , habituation occur ( return mean baseline arousal ) . Habituation continuously monitor use real-time monitoring program currently use lab sample arousal ( GSR ) every 500ms relative average baseline arousal . This method allow idiographic analysis habituation stressor , ensure HR administer habituation . Individuals continue high level emotional arousal complete emotional stressor task ask sit silence 10 minute ( receive SAM every 120 second ) , habituation yet occur , prompted focus breath help relaxation next 10 minute . Based finding use emotional stressor task suggest habituation occurs within 3 minute veteran PTSD , investigator confident approach result habituation . Once habituation occur , HR hear via headphone 3 time ( total 6 ) participant randomize hear HR , whereas No-HR participant hear nothing . The HR series neutral novel sound last 6 , series sound used current lab ongoing study test extinction reminder . After HR play , Study Coordinator use standardize instruction tell participant remember sound reminder calming . Lastly , SUDS self-reported emotional arousal measure assess ( SAM ) . Physiological data continuously measure throughout period . Although expect occur frequently , data participant habituate use analysis , additional participant run . After complete stressor task , 15 minute break , follow second third administration stressor task use procedure outline , different personalize stressor record time . Investigators randomize order recording participant describe clinical assessment . At end third emotional stressor task , participant schedule Testing Phase one week later . Testing Phase ( Day 2 ) -One week Learning Phase , participant complete Testing Phase Exp . 1 . Upon arrival , half participant randomly assign test original laboratory room Learning Phase ( room Day 1 ) half new room . In line investigator ' previous learn study use context manipulation , new room Testing Phase represent different context compare room Learning Phase . The novel testing room different size , light , furniture . Using scent machine , novel room smell mint release test . In addition , ensure experimenter function reminder habituation Learning Phase , test novel room do different experimenter original Learning Phase . In original novel testing room , Testing Phase begin baseline ( procedure ) . Next , new record personally relevant stressor play ( procedure Learning Phase ) . Participants room randomly assign hear HR hear nothing ( No HR ) . The HR present headphone every 10 second onset stressor task . Measures psychological distress emotional arousal obtain ( procedure Learning Phase ) . As Learning Phase , 10 minute habituation occur operationalized , stressor end self-reported psychological distress emotional arousal assess . Experiment 2 -In original novel test room , Testing Phase begin baseline ( procedure ) . Next , new record personally relevant stressor play ( procedure Learning Phase ) . Participants room randomly assign hear HR hear nothing ( No HR ) . The HR present headphone every 10 second onset stressor task . Measures psychological distress emotional arousal obtain ( procedure Learning Phase ) . As Learning Phase , 10 minute habituation occur operationalized , stressor end self-reported psychological distress emotional arousal assess . Because group 5 7 Exp . 1 heard HR Testing Phase , may therefore associated emotional stressor habituation , participant randomize Exp . 2 . The participant Exp . 2 randomize either hear HR sham sound deliver via automate server cellular phone platform negative emotion endorse . The result 2 ( Day 1 HR v. No HR ) X 2 ( Phone HR v. sham sound ) Latin square experimental design . Procedure . At conclusion Exp . 1 , Clinical Assessor orient participant Exp . 2 . Over next week , participant receive eight call day ( approximately one call every two waking hour ) , call last 1-2 minute . For experimental condition ( HR v. Sham ) , call first day use establish baseline level psychological distress ( SUDS ; 0-9 ) , emotional valence ( positive vs. negative ; 1-9 scale ; endpoint SAM use ) strength emotional arousal ( 1-9 ; SAM ) , HRs deliver . On day , participant report high emotional arousal ( i.e. , &gt; 4 ) low valence ( i.e. , negative affect ; &lt; 5 ) , automatically hear HR sham sound base randomization Exp . 2 condition . The sham sound series neutral percussive sound unrelated HR form equivalent relevant parameter ( e.g. , amplitude , length ) . After HR sham sound , participant provide self-reported psychological distress ( SUDS ) emotional valence/arousal , order evaluate differential change due HR sham sound . After one week , participant return laboratory return phone , receive compensation , debriefed . To evaluate clinically meaningful change due HR , experimenter collect pre- , post-Exp . 2 assessment symptoms clinical outcome measure ( e.g. , symptom anxiety depression When begin Exp . 2 , information give use phone ( hands-free headset ) , keep battery charge , call study staff . Phones restrict study-related access emergency number . All call conduct use dedicate server exist software lab . The software use automate dial record prompt ask participant provide rating phone keypad . First , mitigate possibility phone steal , sell , use , Study Coordinator participant create plan use phone . Second , self-report scale Exp . 1 . Third , call time patient normally awake . No participant identify information accessible cell phone . All data phone store real-time password-protected computer lab . Experiment 3 -The primary aim Exp . 3 evaluate feasibility , acceptability , preliminary effect size estimate self-initiated HR ( n = 50. psychological distress acute negative emotion hear HRs two week . Investigators examine : ( 1 ) frequency call hear HR within across participant time daily life acute negative emotion , ( 2 ) laboratory HR training affect psychological distress emotional arousal/valence naturalistic setting time . Procedures . At conclusion Exp . 1 , Clinical Assessor orient participant Exp . 3 . Participants ask call automate server next two week feel acute negative emotion . To facilitate use HR , assessor discus expect upcoming stressful event , particular occur daily frequently , explain phone use cope stressful emotionally arouse situation . Participants also tell receive three automated call day , begin next day . During 2 week period , participant call lab hear brief greeting assessment present SUDS , emotional arousal valence . If participant indicate emotional arousal &gt; 4 valence &lt; 5 , automate system ask would like hear HR . If participant meet requirement indicate want hear HR , instead hear brief message thank call . After HR thank message , participant ask report SUDS , emotional arousal valence , call end . The procedure call identical Exp . 2 , except participant receive 3 call day , access HRs , able choose whether hear HR . After two week , participant return lab , give back cell phone , complete exit interview , receive compensation . Exp . 3 compliance enhancement strategy Exp . 2 , except incentive structure . Interviews-Diagnostic exclusion current/past prevalence Axis I II diagnosis determine Structured Clinical Interview Mental Disorders-I II . Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) assess Peabody Picture Vocabulary Testâ€”Third Edition ( PPVT-III ) . The Treatment History Interview ( THI ) use assess previous ongoing psychiatric service receive . The THI administer pre- post-experiment time point . All interview videotape , investigator determine reliability every tenth interview . Exit interview conduct end Exp . 3 assess participant ' acceptability HR . Physiological Measurement-Skin conductance measure use Ag-AgCl electrode middle phalanx middle ring finger participant 's non-dominant hand . The electrode connect Biopac MP150 device adjacent room . Amplified signal analog data convert digital form filter use Biopac 's AcKnowledge Software , store database computer .
