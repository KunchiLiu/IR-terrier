	<brief_summary>Despite introduction multiple preventative measure rate hospital acquired infection intensive care unit remain high . New approach tackle problem require . The neutrophil ( type white blood cell ) key cell fight bacterial fungal infection body . This research group already show majority patient intensive care neutrophils n't ingest germ effectively therefore less able fight infection . These patient , whose white blood cell n't work properly , much likely develop second infection whilst hospital ( hospital acquire infection ) . Previous work do group show add drug call granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) sample blood patient lab , possible restore ability white blood cell ingest bacteria fight infection . This study test whether possible restore capacity patient ' white blood cell eat germ give GM-CSF injection intensive care . The study involve identify adult patient intensive care whose white blood cell n't work properly way . Patients take part study receive injection , skin , either drug , GM-CSF , solution effect ( placebo ) . The investigator compare whether patient receive GM-CSF injection improvement function white blood cell compare n't . As well look function white blood cell investigator also study whether difference rate infection pick hospital two group . This study fund Medical Research Council .</brief_summary>
