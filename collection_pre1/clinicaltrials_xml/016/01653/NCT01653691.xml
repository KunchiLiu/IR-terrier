	<brief_title>Laser Therapy Treating Hypertrophic Burn Scars Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study hope answer important question pediatric burn care : technique whereby tunable-dye laser neo-vessel ablation optimally employed ameliorate hypertrophic scar result burn injury child ? Hypertrophic scar consider adverse wound heal event result abnormal scar formation . This scar process associate pruritis discomfort interfere function aesthetic . Topical cream , massage , stretch pressure use standard treatment burn scar formation . With child serve control , want objectively measure impact PDL burn scar child . Variables time application , duration number session collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>subject 9 year old 21 year age young second degree burn erythema potential hypertrophic scar thigh trunk . subject clinically stable within 3 month burn injury . burn size least 15cm2 able divide equivalent half ( divide along line tension ) . Equivalent orientation distance mobil joint regard history , physical finding , proximity tension produce force orientation . subject acute phase burn injury generally less one year time burn injury 23 month post burn deem appropriate pressure therapy , evaluate appropriate candidate surgeon involve study inclusion . subject include one year post burn refer another treatment facility . skin condition could potentially adverse effect wound heal race/ethnic group children/guardians significant others ability speak English Spanish respond study questionnaire . subject less 9 year old age group fragile . subject second degree burn thigh trunk subject chemical burn subject low risk hypertrophic scar ( wound demonstrate fade erythema 912 week wound heal less 3 week low risk hypertrophic scar ) . Vancouver scar scale pigmentation rating 0 1 , vascularity rating 0 1 . TBSA great 50 % massive burn confound result . potential life threaten injury would confound effect laser treatment complicate sequential administration therapy ( e.g . shock , sepsis , inhalation therapy , brain injury ) . subject inclusion criterion meet evaluation surgeon negative inclusion study . children/guardians significant others inability speak English Spanish respond questionnaire .
