	<brief_summary>This research study do see lymphocyte collect patient high grade glioma start standard radiation chemotherapy . ( Lymphocytes cell normally circulate blood essential part immune system ) . The investigator goal store give back patient radiation complete . This part large effort attempt preserve immune system effect radiation chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lymphocyte Reinfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient blood collect ( apheresis ) start patient plan standard care radiation therapy chemotherapy : - An IV insert vein patient arm . - The blood send machine remove lymphocytes return rest patient . - This procedure last 1 hour 15 minute 4 hour . - During time patient also treat blood thinner prevent blood clot machine . - The lymphocyte count store . If insufficient number collect , ask another similar collection 1 week . - After patient complete full 6 week radiation , lymphocyte return patient simple intravenous infusion . A large intravenous access ( i.e . midline ) might need . Any cell reinfused store 1 year discard . - Study blood ( 10 ml ) collect time lymphocyte collection , prior lymphocyte reinfusion , every 2 week week 20th . These blood sample store used future analysis . Blood count obtain weekly part standard care patient kind brain tumor . For first 14 week lymphocyte reinfusion extra test routinely collect blood see effective reinfused lymphocyte raise patient lymphocyte count . These result available patient treat physician . At time study interfere patient plan standard care radiation chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
