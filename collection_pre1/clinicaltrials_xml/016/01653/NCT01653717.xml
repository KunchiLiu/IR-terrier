	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose T cell give combination standard chemotherapy patient CLL . The safety combination also study . The T cell use study type white blood cell take blood genetically change laboratory . The process change DNA ( genetic material cell ) T cell call gene transfer . After gene transfer complete , genetically change T-cells put back body . These T cell may help prevent cancer cell come back .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD19-specific T-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level genetically change T cell , base join study . Up 4 dose level T cell test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose T cell find . All participant receive dose chemotherapy . T Cell Collection ( leukapheresis standard blood draw ) : Within 30 day complete screening test , leukapheresis perform Apheresis Clinic MD Anderson . Before leukapheresis : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test measure level certain protein . A leukapheresis procedure use remove blood body specific blood cell , T cell , collect . After specific cell collect , remain blood return body . To perform leukapheresis , blood drawn needle vein one arm , pass though machine collect white blood cell , remain blood return back needle vein arm . The procedure take 3 hour complete . If doctor think best interest , instead leukapheresis , blood ( 13.5 tablespoon ) draw collect white blood cell instead . If certain type unwanted T cell grow much , investigational device call CliniMACS® system use filter unwanted T cell use magnet . It take 7 week modify grow necessary number genetically modify T cell lab . If researcher able collect enough T cell assign dose level , take study . Other option discuss doctor . Chemotherapy : Before receive T cell infusion , receive standard chemotherapy fludarabine cyclophosphamide catheter ( plastic tube ) insert large chest vein intravenous needle ( IV ) insert vein arm . Fludarabine give vein 30 minute daily 3 day . Cyclophosphamide give vein 3 hour daily 3 day . Study Tests Before T cell Infusion : Within 60 day T cell infusion : - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn test look DNA check status disease . This may perform time study . - Mouse protein antibody use gene transfer process . If body become immune protein , body may develop antibody mouse antibody ( call `` human anti-mouse antibody '' HAMA ) . Part blood sample use compare another sample blood collect gene transfer complete check HAMA . - You echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan check heart function . - You lung function test . - If study doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone bone marrow withdrawn large needle . - If study doctor think need , compute tomography ( CT ) scan and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . Within 7 day start chemotherapy : - You physical exam , include measurement weight , vital sign . - Your medical history review update record . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample used pregnancy test able become pregnant . To continue participation study , pregnant . T-cell Infusion ( gene transfer ) : The T cell infusion give vein 15-30 minute . Before infusion , receive drug low risk allergic reaction T cell . Tylenol® ( acetaminophen ) give mouth Benadryl® ( diphenhydramine ) may give mouth vein minute . Your vital sign check T cell infusion . Study Tests T cell infusion : Within 3 day , 1 week ( +/- 2 day ) , 2 week ( +/- 3 day ) , 1 month ( +/- 7 day ) , 6 month ( +/- 14 day ) , 12 month ( +/- 14 day ) T-cell infusion , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your medical history review update record . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test , test measure level certain protein , test look DNA check status disease . Part blood sample use compare sample blood collect gene transfer check HAMA ( 6 month T cell infusion ) . At 1 , 6 , 12 month T-cell infusion , part blood sample use measure level certain protein . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn body 's immune system respond T-cell infusion . At around 6 12 month T-cell infusion , study doctor think need CT scan , PET-CT scan , and/or bone marrow biopsy check status disease . Length Study : Your participation study complete last planned study visit 12 month T cell infusion complete . You may take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , keep appointment , doctor think best interest , unable receive T-cell infusion . If leave study early reason receive T-cells , possible , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect . This blood sample use compare another sample blood collect gene transfer complete check HAMA . Long-Term Follow-Up Study : For safety reason , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require patient receive stem cell infusion treat gene transfer procedure must long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . You ask sign separate consent form long-term follow-up study Protocol 2006-0676 . This investigational study . Fludarabine cyclophosphamide commercially available FDA approve treatment CLL . The T cell infusion use gene transfer procedure commercially available FDA approve . At time , T cell infusion use gene transfer procedure use research . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
