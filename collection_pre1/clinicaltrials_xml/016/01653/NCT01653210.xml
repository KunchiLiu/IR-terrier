	<brief_summary>This overall research goal develop mobile-based module improve glycemic control menstrual cycle woman Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . This module run Android Operating System ( OS ) available : ( ) stand-alone application ( ii ) important additional component large system , Diabetes Assistant ( DiAs ) - mobile-based medical platform diabetes application . This proposal aim build one application module target improvement diabetes control young woman experience glucose variation relate menstrual cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Advisory System Glycemic Control During Menstrual Cycle Patient With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose particular protocol study underlie glycemic variability across menstrual cycle woman T1DM . A subset premenopausal woman T1DM experience loss glucose control latter half cycle ( luteal phase ) . Clinical trial sparse tool limit focus aspect diabetes care highly relevant affected individual . To obtain data initialize mobile-based module , enroll premenopausal woman approximately three-month outpatient study design characterize least three complete menstrual cycle . These subject wear continuous glucose monitor ( CGMs ) , record self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBGs ) utilize insulin pump capture insulin dose . In-home ovulation kit use determine relevant day sex-steroid blood measurement define menstrual cycle phase . Finally , structure at-home meal provide different phase menstrual cycle insulin action parameter assessment . The software module develop parallel data collection study subject . The software module use patient study existence would develop parallel . The goal module functionality 1 ) assist patient provider identification management glycemic variability surround menstrual cycle 2 ) add value become integral module within artificial pancreas .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Premenopausal woman menstrual cycle occur approximately every 2040 day . 2 . T1DM ( defined American Diabetes Association criterion judgment physician ) least 2 year prior enrollment study 3 . Age ≥18 y.o . ≤55 y.o . 4 . Use insulin pump treat diabetes least 6 month . 5 . Has identify healthcare provider provide advice diabetes care . 6 . Actively use current insulin pump predefined parameter glucose goal , carbohydrate ratio , insulin sensitivity factor . 7 . Willingness additional fingersticks request CGM alarm low high end ( &lt; 70 mg/dl &gt; 300 mg/dl ) , 8 . Willingness come Center Diabetes Technology study visit . 9 . Willingness avoid consumption acetaminophencontaining product duration study . 10 . Demonstration proper mental status cognition completion study . 11 . Hemoglobin A1c 510 % 1 . Pregnant intend get pregnant study 2 . Active enrollment another clinical trial 3 . Medical requirement acetaminophencontaining product study period 1 week 4 . Use medication intervention significantly alter menstrual cycle oral contraceptive , depoprovera , intrauterine device ( IUD ) . 5 . Medical condition would make operating CGM insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , extensive scar tissue sit device insert ) 6 . Anticipated need Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /Magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) study . Unplanned MRI/MRA require temporary interruption CGM use would allow . 7 . Use prednisone 10 day study . 8 . Uncontrolled thyroid disease 9 . Clinical diagnosis polycystic ovarian syndrome require treatment . 10 . Significant elevation liver function test ( e.g . &gt; 23 time normal ) , know infectious hepatitis HIV . 11 . History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans 12 . Known bleed diathesis dyscrasia 13 . Active renal dialysis 14 . Individuals cognitive impairment prevents understand either consent form intervention content 15 . Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g. , substance abuse ) self report List restriction use drug treatment . 1 . Acetaminophen use CGM . 2 . Use medication intervention significantly alter menstrual cycle oral contraceptive , depoprovera , IUD . 3 . Anticipate need MRI/MRA study . Unplanned MRI/MRA require temporary interruption CGM use would allow . 4 . Use prednisone 10 day study .</criteria>
