	<brief_summary>The rationale study risk anal dysplasia patient inflammatory bowel disease compare general population yet investigate prospectively . There article examine relationship - preliminary result suggest patient IBD increase risk abnormal anal pap smear . As high grade anal dysplasia strongly associate increase risk anal carcinoma , important identify high risk group might benefit routine screening . This pilot study aim determine whether patient IBD Bronx population increase risk abnormal anal Pap smear . We hypothesize increased incidence abnormal anal pap smear patient IBD treat immunosuppressant , give chronic immunosuppression relate increase HPV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IBD patient immunosuppression identify gastroenterology fellow clinic . After patient express interest study , study coordinator provide overview study obtain consent prior initiate research related procedure . Anal Pap smear Digene Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA Tests perform study patient . Medications document IBD subject control . Patient characteristic document include IBD diagnosis , area involvement ( small bowel vs. large bowel , rectal involvement ) , type duration immunosuppressant use , smoke status , family history dysplasia ( include anus ) , reproductive risk factor . Data report subject subject interview questionnaire . For purpose analysis , subject divide two group : IBD patient immunosuppression IBD patient immunosuppression . Results record relation exposure immunosuppressive agent include prednisone , purine analog ( azathioprine/6MP ) , methotrexate , infliximab . Immunosuppression define history least three month azathioprine/6MP , eight consecutive week prednisone great 15mg per day , cumulative dose great 100mg methotrexate , least one infusion infliximab within 8 week date anal Pap smear . Since pilot project , recruit minimum 20 subject group . Abnormalities classify standard Bethesda classification atypical squamous cell undetermined significance ( ASCUS ) , low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) , high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) carcinoma . The pathologist read Pap smear blind patient status ( IBD versus control ) immunomodulator history .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>. Women men age 1865 history inflammatory bowel disease confirm histologically immunosuppression define least three month azathioprine/6MP , eight consecutive week prednisone great 15mg per day , cumulative dose great 100mg methotrexate , least one infusion infliximab within 8 week date anal Pap smear . ii . Women men age 1865 history inflammatory bowel disease confirm histologically immunosuppression ( define ) . Patients HIV , transplant recipient , men sex men already represent high risk group ii .
