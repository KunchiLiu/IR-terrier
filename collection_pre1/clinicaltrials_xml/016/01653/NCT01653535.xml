Often child attend school high number child similarly unprepared negatively influenced disruptive classroom situation punitive teacher practice . Over time , child circumstance tend demonstrate particular behavior , reject family peer , tend receive less support teacher , increase aggressive exchange academic difficulty . Thus , project base hypothesis improve child competency , parent effectiveness , school context school-home communication , time , contribute prevent certain behavior across period early childhood adolescence . Four geographic site select study : Durham , NC , small city large low-income population primarily African American ; Nashville , TN , moderated-sized city mix low-to-middle income African American European-American population ; Seattle , WA , moderate-sized city low-to-middle ethnically diverse population ; central PA , mostly rural area low-to-middle income European American population . These site vary widely ethnicity ( minority African American , Latino ) poverty ( measure free/reduced lunch rate ) follow : Durham , NC , 90 % minority 80 % reduced lunch ; Nashville , TN , 54 % minority 78 % reduced lunch ; rural PA ; 1 % minority 39 % reduced lunch ; Seattle , WA , 52 % minority 46 % reduce lunch . `` High risk '' school within site ( 12 Durham , 9 Nashville , 18 PA , 16 Seattle ) select base crime poverty statistic community serve . Within site , school divide one three pair set match demographic ( size , percentage free reduce lunch , ethnic composition ) , one set within pair randomly assign intervention one control condition . Students elementary school move middle school grade 5 , 6 7 . A multiple-gating screening procedure combine teacher parent rating disruptive behavior apply kindergartener across three cohort ( 1991-93 ) 55 school .

Children select inclusion study base screen score , move high score downward desire sample size reach within site , cohort , condition . Exceptions inclusion rule make child fail matriculate first grade core school ( n=59 ) refuse participate ( n=75 ) , accommodate superceding rule child would female intervention group . The outcome three successive cohort recruit 1991 , 1992 , 1993 yield sample 891 child ( 445 intervention group 446 control group ) .</detailed_description>
