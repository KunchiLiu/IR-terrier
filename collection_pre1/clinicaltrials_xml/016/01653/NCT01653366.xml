	<brief_summary>This study randomize prospective clinical trial woman metastatic breast cancer . The purpose study test intervention regular physical activity review physical activity goal set allow subject achieve moderate increase physical activity 6,000 step per week . The physical activity review consist weekly telephone call inquire symptom set physical activity goal . The study also look see goal set intervention affect time progression , change BMI , quality life . Quality life measure answer questionnaire provide subject regular interval course study . Finally , study examine impact physical activity expression tumor molecular molecule , insulin level , estradiol level . Through intervention regular physical activity review goal setting , investigator hypothesize moderate increase level physical activity 6000 step per week obtain patient metastatic breast cancer receive goal set intervention . The investigator propose able achieve maintain great equal 22500 step per week demonstrate biologic molecular difference compare able achieve level physical activity . The investigator expect people active long progression .</brief_summary>
