	<brief_summary>The result pre-pilot pilot study use determine feasibility fully power trial test effectiveness two different approach diabetes management uninsured diabetic population receives care community base free clinic , namely nurse-directed interdisciplinary care management compare peer-led self management . Effective program uninsured diabetic benefit individual society prevent serious illness , decrease mortality disability , decrease medical debt , stimulate economic growth , improve business productivity , reduce job lock , decrease health disparity , improve quality life , reduce cost shift decrease uncompensated care . Findings generalizable uninsured insured patient across wide spectrum chronic condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Two Approaches Diabetes Management Uninsured</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomized pre-pilot pilot study inform design fully power trial test effectiveness nurse-led interdisciplinary care management intervention ( CM ) improve hemoglobin A1c uninsured diabetic patient receive primary medical care community-based free clinic compare similar patient undergo peer-led self management ( SM ) . The comparative effectiveness approach test randomized trial . To ensure success pilot study investigator perform 6 month pre-pilot study use 10 patient per group . This pre-pilot use establish protocol cover enrollment , HIPAA , consent , intervention outcome measurement . The subsequent 1 year pilot use demonstrate feasibility , estimate recruitment , attendance follow , refine inclusion criterion , provide power analysis , optimize intervention determine appropriate secondary outcome fully power trial . For pilot , thirty patient randomize CM intervention first 6 month . Major component nurse-led CM model include : 1 ) assessment goal set self-management ; 2 ) education self efficacy productive clinical encounter ; 3 ) access specialist care via interdisciplinary team ; 4 ) evidence-based treatment recommendation responsive patient ' goal ; 5 ) care coordination nurse care manager . From 6-12 month patient return usual clinic care . The 30 patient randomized SM group invite attend weekly peer-led SM train broadly base Stanford University Diabetes Self-management Program 's Train Trainer Model . The training occur 6 week cover topic common chronic disease SM program include : goal setting , self-management chronic condition , make action plan , feedback problem solving , handle emotion , symptom management technique , communication health care provider , medication make treatment decision . The peer advisor nurse lead 1 hour monthly group session remainder first 6 month review/revision action plan , review self management technique ongoing social persuasion model . From 6-12 month patient return usual clinic care . For pilot , outcome measure obtain 6 12 month . For pilot , investigator test hypothesis . Instead , effect size confidence interval calculate outcome . These result use power analysis . The result also allow u see intervention effective outcome allow u optimize intervention great impact primary outcome , hemoglobin A1c . Cost effectiveness determine fully power trial .</detailed_description>
