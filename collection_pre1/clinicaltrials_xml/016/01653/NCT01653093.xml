	<brief_summary>In standard clinical care , prostate image magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure take picture body structure use strong magnetic field radio wave . The strength magnet use express unit Tesla ( T ) ; high Tesla number mean magnet strong pull . Standard magnetic resonance image prostate us magnet 1.5 Tesla strong well specialized endorectal coil ( antenna ) insert body due limitation use external body coil magnet strength . MRI use 3 Tesla magnet theoretical advantage image 1.5 Tesla create signal twice strong receive antenna , result good picture . The goal study make MRI procedure comfortable patient use external coil instead endorectal coil . With study , researcher also want help patient ' health care team , surgeon particular . Researchers assess impact prostate MRI , without endorectal coil , do 3 Tesla external body coil help doctor decide approach disease therapy might best patient well correlate patient ' study image clinical imaging</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-Tesla MRI Finding Tumors Patients With Known Suspected Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact prostate MRI , without endorectal coil , do 3-Tesla surgical management . This would perform examine agreement lesion location base MRI compare lesion location base pathology and/or surgery local extent disease , i.e . involvement contiguous organ local lymph node , base MRI compare local extent base pathology and/or surgery . II . To test reproducibility functional MRI ( dynamic-contrast enhance [ DCE_MRI ] MRI , magnetic resonance [ MR ] spectroscopy diffusion-weighted MRI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess usefulness MRI data treatment planning radiation therapy , test feasibility amide-proton-transfer MRI prostate cancer detection . II . To evaluate MRI change prostate tumor morphology endorectal coil versus endorectal coil . III . To assess usefulness ex-vivo prostate specimen MRI accurate co-registration in-vivo MRI prostate pathology slide . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3-tesla ( 3T ) MRI , include DCE-MRI , diffusion-weighted MRI , amide-proton-transfer MRI , MR spectroscopy scan . Patients may undergo additional 3T MRI scan least 24 hour initial scan .</detailed_description>
