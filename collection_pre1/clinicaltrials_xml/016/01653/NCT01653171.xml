	<brief_title>Premedication With Simethicone Simethicone Plus N-acetylcysteine Improving Visibility During Upper Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While globally downward trend incidence gastric cancer , remain second lead cause cancer mortality world . In Chile lead cause death malignant tumor sex , recognize problem public health priority country . Detection gastric cancer early stage huge impact heal therefore prognosis patient . In country like Japan , incidence neoplasm one high world , mass screen program fail demonstrate significant impact population level , body evidence support endoscopic screen especially advent new minimally invasive procedure endoscopic mucosal resection gastric cancer detect early stage . In country , estimate half patient already lymph node metastasis involvement adjacent organ diagnosis . The best way reduce disease burden disease would primary prevention intervention effective early detection . For purpose upper gastrointestinal endoscopy method choice examine gastric mucosa search early lesion , point adequate visibility mucosa override . Mucus , foam bubble accumulate gastrointestinal tract mucosa interfere adequate endoscopic visualization thus represent risk fail diagnose early lesion . For reason various anti-foam agent , anti-bubbles widely use endoscopic center mainly Japan , use almost rule , unlike West use limit theoretical risk aspiration . Simethicone proven good anti-foam agent prior endoscopy remove mucus bubble . It also study scenario colonoscopy additive preparation colon eliminate bubble endoscopic capsule small bowel preparation well Endoscopic Ultrasound reduce artifacts increase accuracy study . Currently N-acetylcysteine , mucolytic agent , either alone combination Simethicone proven effective remove mucus gastric bubble use 20 minute prior upper endoscopy , improve visualization gastric mucosa . Other agent pronase also describe useful task yet available area . In context relevance gastric cancer environment , low rate early cancer detection absence national policy preparation agent may improve visualization mucosa , study aim compare effect product available country preparation endoscopy order improve visualization mucosa increase chance recognize early lesion .</detailed_description>
