	<brief_summary>Background : Portable oxygen concentrators ( POCs ) feature late integrate oxygen conserve device ( OCDs ) provide great patient accessibility mobility ambulation travel . Recent POCs compact , lightweight , battery-operated , require refill-time , thus meet patient ' clinical lifestyle need . There , however , lack research clinical performance late POCs could help determine ability maintain patient ' oxygen saturation ≥ 90 % exercise . Aim : The purpose study compare ability three POCs , maximum oxygen production capability 950 3000 ml per minute , maintain oxygen saturation ≥ 90 % patient chronic lung disease exercise . Method : Six minute walk test ( 6-MWTs ) administer order measure oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) 20 patient diagnosis either Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , Pulmonary Fibrosis ( PF ) document exertional oxygen desaturations ≤ 85 % room air . All participant participate 4 different 6-minute walk test : first control walk perform participant ' current oxygen system set prescribed exertional flow rate . Then , participant perform walk test three POCs set unit ' maximum pulse dose set . The order participant use POCs randomly assign use sequence generator . Hypothesis : It hypothesize three POCs provide oxygen saturation ≥ 90 % exercise patient chronic lung disease moderate severe exertional oxygen desaturation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants attend two study session . During session 1 participant perform 6-minute walk test room air oxygen ass suitability study . Only participant document exertional oxygen desaturations ≤ 85 % measure pulse oximetry walk ask return second session . During session 2 participant perform four 6-minute walk test spread morning afternoon test session . All data primary secondary outcome measure session 2 .</detailed_description>
