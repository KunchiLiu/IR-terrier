	<brief_summary>The primary objective work determine half-dose Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) perform 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi without Wide Beam Reconstruction apply achieve image quality diagnostic accuracy non-inferior standard MBI perform 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Half-Dose Molecular Breast Imaging With Wide Beam Reconstruction Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent implementation dose reduction strategy Molecular Breast Imaging allow performance MBI administer dose 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi , reduce previously use dose 20-30 mCi . In order safely introduce MBI screen modality , aim perform MBI use 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi . An image processing algorithm call Wide Beam Reconstruction ( WBR ) tailor MBI technology goal allow either current administer dose current acquisition time reduce half .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subgroup 1 , Patients breast lesion : At least one breast lesion detect mammogram , ultrasound breast MRI measure &lt; 20 mm great dimension , present mass , consider suspicious highly suggestive malignancy accord Breast Imaging Reporting Data System Atlas criterion ( BIRADS 4 5 ) , schedule coreneedle biopsy surgical biopsy . OR At least one breast lesion measure &gt; 10 mm &lt; 20 mm great dimension , present mass , biopsyproven malignant , scheduled surgical resection . AND Age &gt; 40 year Negative pregnancy test , postmenopausal , surgically sterilize Subgroup 2 , Patients without know breast lesion : Negative screening mammogram perform Mayo Clinic Rochester within 15 month prior performance study MBI No sign symptoms breast disease Age &gt; 40 year Negative pregnancy test , postmenopausal , surgically sterilize Vacuumassisted excisional biopsy perform prior study MBI . Reason : type biopsy likely remove tumor MBI perform biopsy neoadjuvant chemotherapy plan prior surgery . Reason : true tumor size able ascertain final pathology finding Breast implant . Reason : case breast implant easily identifiable blinded interpretation take place study end Suspected breast fit MBI field view . Reason : case require tiled view additional view easily identifiable blinded interpretation take place study end Only one breast remain . Reason : unilateral case easily identifiable blinded interpretation take place study end ; injection timing design bilateral view Pregnancy test ( necessary ) negative , patient unable complete pregnancy test Physically unable sit upright still remain still two consecutive MBI study course 2hour period .</criteria>
