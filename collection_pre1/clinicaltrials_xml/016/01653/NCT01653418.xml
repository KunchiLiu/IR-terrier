	<brief_summary>BEAM regimen ( BCNU , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) commonly use condition regimen relapsed/refractory lymphoma patient need autologous stem cell transplantation . Since component effective myeloma bortezomib show promising result transplant setting , investigator propose phase II study investigate combination bortezomib BEAM new condition regimen patient relapse progress first autologous transplantation second autologous transplant consider .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must histologically confirm diagnosis multiple myeloma . Patient must receive prior autologous stem cell transplantation melphalan condition multiple myeloma subsequent disease progression repeat autologous stem cell transplantation deem appropriate treating physician . Patient must receive induction chemotherapy include 2 4 cycle antimyeloma therapy include bortezomib , without immune modulate agent and/or corticosteroid , Completion induction therapy occur within 30 day first study drug dose . Patient must ≥ 2x106/kg CD34+ autologous stem cell available transplantation . Patient must ≥ 18 year age . Patient must life expectancy great 6 month . Patient must ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % ( see Appendices A B ) Patient must normal bone marrow organ function define within 14 day prior first study drug dose ( condition regimen ) : Absolute neutrophil count ≥500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine clearance ( Appendix C ) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry Day +100 visit . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Patient must able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Patient must refractory induction therapy . Refractory define disease progression therapy within 30 day follow completion therapy . Patient must disease progression require active treatment within 12 month previous autologous stem cell transplant . Maintenance therapy consider active treatment .
