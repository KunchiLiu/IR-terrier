CM associate significant disability reduce quality life . Since late 1990s , considerable progress neurostimulation technique treat medically intractable chronic-headache syndrome patient , apply peripheral-nerve stimulation patient . It indeed well demonstrate non-painful stimulation peripheral nerve elicit analgesic effect , occipital nerve stimulation ( ONS ) , retrograde activation trigemino-cervical complex provide effective pain relief patient headache disorder , include migraine . Recently , high cervical spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) test treatment chronic cluster headache , highlight potential benefit SCS ONS : SCS exert immediate almost maximal effect , allow test phase prior implantation pulse generator possibility remove electrode case insufficient pain relief . Both SCS ONS produce paresthesia , unpleasant tingle sensation patient In recent prospective study , new modality SCS , High Frequency ( HF ) SCS , demonstrate effective safe chronic pain population , Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) population . High Frequency SCS differs conventional SCS several way , present significant advantage patient healthcare professional : 1 ) absence paresthesia ( tingle ) lead great patient comfort acceptance therapy , 2 ) short procedural time paresthesia mapping need , 3 ) increase efficacy compare conventional SCS , demonstrate FBSS population . Additionally , HF SCS similar safety profile conventional SCS . HF-SCS may thus combine advantage paresthesia free therapy ( thus great patient tolerability therapy ) possibility test therapy trial phase prior implantation permanent pulse generator . 2 .
