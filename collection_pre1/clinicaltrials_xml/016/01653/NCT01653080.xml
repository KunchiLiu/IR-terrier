	<brief_summary>This study do due new image method may help others future improve evaluation disease eye eye socket help make decision concern best treatment disease . Previous study suggest dynamic contrast enhance MRI ideally suit show small structure eye eye socket well provide information eye socket blood circulation . This research may also provide information likelihood tumor spread eye organ well correlate study image clinical imaging</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility DCE-MRI ( dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance image ) non-invasive image tool image contrast enhancement ocular orbital tumor . II . To compare contrast enhancement distribution within orbital tissue . III . To assess potential difference contrast enhancement help characterize malignant lesion well discriminate benign tissue . IV . To compare image characteristic clinical high field end ex-vivo ultra high field magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging . V. To correlate imaging finding obtain histology compare contrast enhancement parameter , e.g . maximum signal intensity , histology characteristic , e.g . vascular density . OUTLINE : Patients undergo DCE-MRI . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
