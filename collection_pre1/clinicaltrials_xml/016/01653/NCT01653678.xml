	<brief_summary>The VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL ( VITAL ; NCT 01169259 ) ongoing randomize clinical trial 25,875 U.S. men woman investigate whether take daily dietary supplement vitamin D3 ( 2000 IU ) omega-3 fatty acid ( OmacorÂ® fish oil , 1 gram ) reduce risk develop cancer , heart disease , stroke people prior history illness . The VITAL Hypertension ancillary study conduct among participant VITAL examine whether vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid relate change blood pressure hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Omega-3 Hypertension Trial ( VITAL Hypertension )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human toll hypertension staggering , effective preventive measure need . Studies suggest inadequate vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid level may involve development hypertension multiple pathway . Results several small clinical trial suggest agent may blood pressure lower effect , however , large trial use high dos vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid prevention hypertension among people normal blood pressure level lack . The VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL ( VITAL ) provide cost-effective set examine effect study agent change blood pressure new diagnosis hypertension . VITAL Hypertension test follow hypothesis : ( 1 ) whether vitamin D fish oil supplementation lower 24-hour blood ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) compare placebo subcohort 1,000 participant ; ( 2 ) whether vitamin D fish oil supplementation reduces risk incident hypertension compare placebo among randomized VITAL participant without baseline hypertension ; ( 3 ) whether vitamin D fish oil supplementation favorably change hypertension-related biomarkers potential mechanism link vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid hypertension compare placebo . A representative subcohort 1,000 VITAL participant without hypertension select major metropolitan area throughout US invited participate home-based study visit baseline 2 year follow-up . During visit , participant ask wear monitor record 24-hour ABP measurement , provide fast blood , spot urine sample , clinical measurement . The visit conduct Examination Management Services , Inc. ( EMSI ) , nationally base , clinical service provider . We compare 2-year change ABP among randomized vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid supplement versus randomize placebo . In addition , assess 2-year change level clinically mechanistically relevant biomarkers hypertension compare 2 treatment group . New diagnose hypertension among VITAL participant ascertain annual follow-up questionnaire . To strengthen classification hypertension status , supplement questionnaire data annual updates hypertension information base upon outpatient diagnostic code medication prescription usage Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) database . Incidence hypertension among assigned active agent versus placebo compare . In addition , baseline blood sample 1,000 participant new diagnosis hypertension compare 2,000 participant without hypertension determine whether effect vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplement incidence hypertension modify baseline plasma level vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid . Results VITAL Hypertension provide important evidence support refute potential preventive role vitamin D omega-3 fatty acid blood pressure development hypertension .</detailed_description>
