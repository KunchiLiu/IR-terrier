	<brief_summary>There uncertainty whether live attenuate vaccine ( LAIV ) offer additional benefit inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) provide indirect benefit unvaccinated herd immunity . The goal randomize clinical trial determine whether immunize child Hutterite colony LAIV provide increase community-wide protection TIV . Children age 3 15 year Hutterite colony Alberta Saskatchewan randomize one two regimen : TIV LAIV . The primary outcome study laboratory-confirmed influenza detect PCR participant ( i.e vaccine recipient nonrecipients ) . Secondary outcome include influenza-like illness , hospitalization , pneumonia , death , antibiotic use , absenteeism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Live Versus Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Study Hutterite Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study test whether immunize child Hutterite colony LAIV significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza entire community compare TIV . We hypothesize ≥70 % uptake LAIV compare similar uptake TIV among healthy child adolescent reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza LAIV colonies 50 % compare TIV colony . Other specific objective determine LAIV reduces influenza healthy child adolescent immunize LAIV reduces follow relative TIV participant : influenza-like illness , antimicrobial prescription , physician-diagnosed otitis medium , school work-related absenteeism , physician visit respiratory illness , low respiratory infection , pneumonia , hospitalization , death . We assess reactogenicity study group .</detailed_description>
