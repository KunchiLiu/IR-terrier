	<brief_title>Alisertib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) assess patient within cohort : liposarcoma ( cohort 1 ) ; leiomyosarcoma ( non-uterine ) ( cohort 2 ) ; undifferentiated sarcoma ( include pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma , formerly know malignant fibrous histiocytoma , myxofibrosarcoma ) ( cohort 3 ) ; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( cohort 4 ) ; sarcomas ( cohort 5 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat MLN8237 ( alisertib ) cohort . II . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient treat MLN8237 ( alisertib ) cohort . III . To assess adverse event associate patient treat MLN8237 cohort OUTLINE : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 18 month .</detailed_description>
