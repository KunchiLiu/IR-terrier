	<brief_summary>Over 100,000 VHA patient receive anticoagulant ( blood thinner ) year prevent blood clot ( include stroke ) . Too much anticoagulation increase risk serious even fatal bleeding , little anticoagulation fails protect patient blood clot . VHA anticoagulation clinic vary widely much time patient spend therapeutic range , range within protect clot excessive risk bleeding . Anticoagulation clinic improve anticoagulation control follow several relatively simple procedure , include following-up promptly patient range focus educate support patient poor control . In study , investigator promote practice anticoagulation clinic New England VA region , goal improve anticoagulation control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Over 100,000 VA patient receive oral anticoagulation ( AC ) year prevent blood clot , include stroke . AC safer effective manage skillfully therefore well-controlled . AC control measure use percent time therapeutic range ( TTR ) , proportion time patient sufficiently anticoagulated prevent clot excessively anticoagulated ( increase risk bleed ) . The investigator show anticoagulation clinic ( ACCs ) VA vary widely TTR , 40 % ( poor control ) 70 % ( excellent control ) . Improving TTR VA would prevent thousand adverse event , include stroke , major hemorrhage , death . The investigator investigate structure process care contribute wide disparity TTR performance . Objectives : In propose study , investigator apply proven method change provider behavior improve patient adherence self-management . The goal facilitate adoption evidence-based practice order improve TTR VISN 1 . The investigator accomplish two-part intervention : 1 ) A clinician-focused intervention utilize educational outreach , audit feedback , internal facilitation , external facilitation promote improvement four evidence-based process care . 2 ) A patient-focused intervention utilize outreach , group educational seminar , motivational interviewing educate patient poor baseline anticoagulation control promote behavior change . Methods : The clinician-focused intervention use Dashboard measure site-level TTR process care Algorithm routine AC management . Both Dashboard Algorithm concrete representation main evidence-based recommendation improve AC management . The investigator promote use quarterly visit site , include audit feedback educational outreach , also provide external facilitation address way improve performance measure . The patient-level intervention deliver 25 % VISN patient low TTR baseline ( &lt; 50 % ) . ACC staff identify patient use Dashboard , send outreach letter invite attend brief educational seminar . All intervention patient , whether attended seminar , receive follow-up management include motivational interviewing ( MI ) address behavior change . The main outcome Aim 1 change site TTR time , compare VISN 1 non-VISN 1 site use interrupted time series . The main outcome Aim 2 change patient-level TTR , intervention control patient compare use regression discontinuity analysis . Secondary outcome include site-level change process anticoagulation care ( measure use automate data ) , cost cost saving , sustainability change time . Anticipated Impact : The goal project increase TTR VISN 1 75 % , far high VISN . Such improvement TTR associate greatly reduce rate adverse event patient . Improved TTR save money intervention cost , large part efficiencies management less-frequent follow-up better control patient . At conclusion regional project , investigator promote spread intervention throughout VHA .</detailed_description>
