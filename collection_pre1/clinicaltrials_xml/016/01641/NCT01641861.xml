	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Papacarie® Conventional Method Dental Caries Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries child continue affect significant portion world population , especially develop country . There many technique use dental caries treatment . The conventional method remove caries prepare cavity use dental bur . Disadvantages method ; however , include patient ' repulsion drilling , possible thermal change tooth surface may effect dental pulp tissue . In addition , drilling technique frequently require local anesthesia injection sometimes result removal sound tooth tissue . To overcome problem preserve healthy dental tissue , chemo-mechanical caries removal method develop . The advantage chemomechanical caries removal include less traumatic , less need local anesthesia , reduce chance dental pulp exposure . And also could benefit medical compromised patient . Papacarie® new chemo-mechanical technique caries removal publish research case report . A randomized control trial therefore need determine efficacy use general population . The aim study evaluate efficacy chemo-mechanical system ( Papacarie® ) caries removal comparison conventional drilling method .</detailed_description>
