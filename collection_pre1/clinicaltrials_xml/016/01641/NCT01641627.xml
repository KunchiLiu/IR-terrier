	<brief_summary>Confinement bed , occur many pathological situation , induces muscle atrophy loss muscle strength . Muscle atrophy associate impaired performance motor task , posture locomotion , therefore major cause loss autonomy . It require stay follow-up rehabilitation service , thus lengthen duration hospitalisation . Data underline importance afferent input integrity maintenance muscle characteristic postural control , suggest countermeasure program base stimulation proprioceptive input could efficient prevent muscle atrophy fall . In particular , fundamental study perform rodent investigator laboratory demonstrated adverse structural functional adaptation occur muscle deconditioning counteract adequate physiological stimulus activation proprioceptor . Based scientific expertise , investigator aim thus prevent muscle atrophy functional consequence posture locomotion , follow surgical intervention human . The investigator develop device allow stimulation foot ankle proprioceptor . In order facilitate evaluation efficiency , device test select population confine bed post-operative period ( knee replacement ) . It efficiency evaluate mean three parameter : muscle force ankle plantar flexor , muscle volume lower limb muscle , functional outcome ( gait balance analysis ) . The technique develop present project could bring benefit patient confine bed , elderly . Preventing retard development muscle atrophy beneficiate health quality life patient . In addition , device might allow consider therapeutic strategy prevention atrophy neuromuscular pathology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study study efficacy proprioceptive stimulation device prevention calf muscle atrophy total knee replacement . The investigator developped safe vibration pressure stimulation device le low limb . The investigator want carry RCT order demonstrate efficacy stimulation device , compare stimulated controle group .</detailed_description>
