	<detailed_description>There grow interest recent year cancer stem cell ( CSC ) implication cancer biology therapy . CSCs refer subset tumor cell ability self-renew generate diverse cell comprise tumor . These cell term cancer Stem cell reflect 'stem-like ' property ability continually initiate sustain tumorigenesis . CSCs share important property normal tissue stem cell , include self-renewal ( symmetric asymmetric division ) differentiation capacity , albeit aberrant . Multilineage differentiation , however , mandatory feature CSC . Furthermore , cell think resistant conventional cancer therapy include chemotherapy radiotherapy may explain rapid tumor cell repopulation follow treatment mainly subtype cell , therefore new therapeutic method target CSCs thorough investigation . One major difficulty find identify CSC hard isolate , grow , enrich . Several vitro assay use identify stem cell , include sphere assay , serial colony-forming unit ( CFU ) assay ( replating assay ) , label-retention assay . Studies also perform goal determine genetic signature define CSCs . However , method potential pitfall complicate interpretation result . Therefore additional method easily harvest enrich CSCs require . Currently , vast majority cell cultivate 2-D flat hard plastic plate flasks inert cell . However CSCs grown 3-D serum free condition make growth slow complicate . Often proteins , fibronectin collagen , employ coating render plastic `` cell friendly '' . However yield still low ; cost high , require much floor space ( large footprint ) . Moreover , cell attach plastic must trypsinized order transfer implant affect survival cell expose digest enzymes . Fibrinogen acute phase protein , occur 2-4g/l human blood , upon treatment glucocorticoid , inflammation trauma , concentration fibrinogen increase Fibrinogen exert adhesive effect culture fibroblast cell . Specifically fibrinogen various lytic fragment ( D.E , FPA ) show chemotactic macrophage , human fibroblast endothelial cell . Fibrin matrix commonly use surgical hemostasis tissue seal Fibrin ( ogen ) - possible candidate 3-D matrix cell culture could fabricate , major component blood coagulation system . Native fibrinogen soluble aqueous buffer usually employ cell culture application , except coat plastic . However , mixed trace thrombin , become transform insoluble fibrin clot attract cell provide provisional matrix tissue repair . Experimental plan : 1 . Generating enrich CSC ( vitro ) establish cell line human cancer We isolate , purify , characterize CSC series establish cell line include , U87-MG human glioma , MCF7 breast carcinoma PANC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma , use standard technique describe Methods . These cell culture grown monolayer 's serum contain medium sphere serum free medium supplement growth factor . ( 18-7-19 ) We evaluate ability cell form sphere characterize stem cell property use surface marker detection measure ALDH activity . 2 . Growing CSCs iFP substance : iFP may exhibit high attachment response cancer cell , conserve cell surface marker , yield optimal growth rate . In addition , cell IFP could transfer without trypsinization diminish cell damage harvest plastic plate result high survival . Cells culture dish coat iFP substance describe Methods . After 2 week culture , cell harvest identified CSCs cancer stem cell propriety use method describe ( e.g surface marker ALDH activity ) . 3 . To isolate enrich CSCs fresh tumor specimens This aim design promote implication iFP cancer research study , harvest , grow CSCs obtain fresh tumor subsequently use vitro therapeutic test . Such approach optimize therapy may target type cell . Tumor specimen obtain consent patient accord Internal Review The Ethics Board . Tumor sample collect pathology department histological diagnostic assessment tumor resection ( sample still fresh ) . Thus sample receive Laboratory within 30 minute surgery . Tumors prepare single cell suspension grow use either conventional standard method iFP . Subsequently , cell harvest evaluated CSC characteristic use method use cell line . A comparison yield CSC percentage perform iFP conventional methodology .</detailed_description>
