	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore subgroup people osteoarthritic knee identify use McKenzie System Mechanical Diagnosis Therapy . In spine subgroup , term derangement , show respond rapidly specific directional exercise . The trial explore whether derangement knee respond specific exercise compare control group exercise non-derangement knee give general exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The McKenzie System With Arthritic Knees : Do Some Knees Respond Specific Exercise More Than General Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Mechanical Diagnosis Therapy ( MDT ) approach extensively use classify treat patient spinal pain . Studies show approach valid , reliable able predict outcome . Although approach use extremity joint research use approach classify individual present knee osteoarthritis . An assessment tool could potentially identify subgroup patient would experience dramatic rapid improvement conservative care would valuable . Patients `` osteoarthritic knee '' diagnosis recruit consultation orthopaedic surgeon . Patients consent participate randomize intervention group control group . Baseline self report function pain collect . The control group continue plan wait list either follow orthopaedic consultation knee surgery . The intervention group assess one three McKenzie credentialed therapist 3 assessment session . The therapist classify patient either `` derangement '' . Those classified derangement 2-3 follow session give direction specific exercise consistent principle McKenzie System 2 week . Those patient classify derangement give 2-3 session evidence base osteoarthritis treatment consist strengthen exercise advice aerobic fitness exercise . At 2 week group baseline measure reassess discharge . Follow-up telephone 3 month 1 year reassess functional pain measure . Due high prevalence knee osteoarthritis associate economic burden health care system important investigate physiotherapist able predict respond conservative therapy . Classifying individual knee osteoarthritis rapid responder non responder short-term physiotherapy treatment allow expensive medical evaluation intervention direct appropriate patient avoid unnecessary treatment patient likely recover less costly therapy .</detailed_description>
