	<detailed_description>Periodontitis destructive chronic infection gum , ligament , bone , predominantly cause Gram-negative bacteria reside biofilm surround teeth . Biofilm aggregate microbe distinct architecture . This biofilm contain cluster bacterial specie find commonly gingiva associate reproducibly periodontal disease . These bacteria involve periodontitis cause destruction tissue lead formation periodontal pocket . This space become site bacterial colonization possible entry route bacteria blood stream . It evident data periodontal health Pakistani nation poor 28 % 12 year old healthy gum 93 % 65 year old gum periodontal disease . These result indicate periodontal disease include inflammation gum calculus endemic Pakistan . Like caries , level gingival periodontal disease high rural population Pakistan . There increase evidence individual periodontal disease increase risk cardiovascular disease , preterm delivery low birth weight infant , pulmonary disease , diabetes , osteoporosis , rheumatoid arthritis , alzheimer 's disease &amp; kidney disease . The factor predispose periodontal disease accelerate progression clearly evident chronic renal failure . They encompass hyposalivation xerostomia , impaired immunity wound healing , alveolar bone destruction due renal osteodystrophy , bleed diathesis , diabetes mellitus , malnutrition state general disability impair oral hygiene . There evidence increase prevalence periodontal disease patient renal disease , especially dialysis patient . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progressive loss kidney function time . Normal renal function normally evaluate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Normal result range 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 . The loss kidney function usually take month year occur . The final stage chronic kidney disease call end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) kidney long function patient need dialysis kidney transplant . Chronic kidney disease change serum level Albumin , Potassium , Calcium , Phosphorus , Sodium , Cholesterol electrolytes . Among , albumin prime importance play important role keep fluid blood leak tissue . The normal range 3.4 - 5.4 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) . Lower-than-normal level serum albumin may sign kidney disease liver disease ( example , hepatitis , cirrhosis ) . Decreased albumin may occur body get absorb enough nutrient , Crohn 's disease , Low-protein diet , Sprue , Whipple 's disease . Other condition albumin level need measure widespread burn Wilson , disease . Hypoalbuminemia demonstrate strong predictor death chronic renal failure . Some study however suggest hypoalbuminemia may indicative underlie inflammation , rather nutritional status , especially patient kidney disease . In study observe dialysis initiation US pediatric population , hypoalbuminemic patient high risk die compare patient dialysis initiate normal albumin level . It also assess hypoalbuminemia , highly prevalent kidney failure associate increased mortality risk population . Serum albumin level may reflect nutritional status chronic inflammation . A propose mechanism effect periodontitis development kidney disease systemic inflammation . Periodontal pathogen show ability adhere , invade , proliferate coronary endothelial cell lead atheroma formation impaired vasculature relaxation . Cardiovascular disease CKD share many risk factor , assume periodontal disease exert similar effect within vasculature kidney . Both periodontitis kidney disease associate inflammatory marker C-reactive protein chronic low level inflammation associate periodontitis may lead endothelial dysfunction play role pathogenesis kidney disease edentulous patient . The deleterious effect systemic inflammation kidney function could occur period active periodontal infection accumulate life time individual . Inflammation important predictor low serum albumin level among dialysis patient , independent nutritional status . Low albumin often indicative malnutrition , chronic inflammation appear culprit half patient low level albumin . This may explain nutritional therapy increase serum albumin level patient suggest chronic inflammation . High CRP level correlate increase mortality , regardless nutritional status suggest independent role chronic inflammation cause hypoalbuminemia . Abhijit V. Kshirsagar et al . observe association severe periodontal disease hypoalbuminemia group patient receive long-term outpatient hemodialysis . In study subject , patient periodontal disease three time likely low serum albumin patient without periodontal disease . Increased level plaque report hemodialysis ( HD ) population several country include Brazil . It note , however , HD patient also repeatedly expose systemic anticoagulation high-dose heparin blood purification procedure . This predispose gingival bleeding , consequence , facilitate bacterial colonization growth , may propagate periodontal disease . Recently , impressive 3-fold decrease C-reactive protein rise hemoglobin ( Hb ) level HD patient report occur already 4-6 week follow traditional periodontal therapy . Thus , issue poor oral health status CKD patient apparently deserve high awareness problem , increase attention , indicate need close collaboration primary care physician , nephrologists dentist . There evidence support contribution periodontitis systemic inflammation . Several possible mechanism suggest , include locally produce inflammatory mediator bacterial by-product invade blood stream , interact host cell trigger inflammatory response . A study Turkey End Stage Renal disease ( ESRD ) patient HD therapy find increase periodontitis measure Community Periodontal Index Treatment Needs ( CPITN ) . In study renal patient receive HD , Chaung et al , 2005 Taiwan , report increase rate periodontitis compare national data periodontal disease Taiwanese population . Studies focus periodontal health End Stage Renal disease ( ESRD ) patient HD maintenance therapy report presence poor oral hygiene attendant gingival inflammation . Bots CP , Poortermann JHG , Brand HS et al ( 2006 ) study Netherlands ESRD patient , receive HD , find increased loss attachment compare healthy case-matched control . Periodontal status End stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) patient receive HD show increase periodontal index compare case-matched control . The author note HD group great number periodontopathic bacterial specie control group . The result study conduct far establish association severe periodontitis hypoalbuminemia variable conclusive . Only one clinical trial conduct regarding , therefore aim study observe effect non surgical periodontal therapy change albumin level maintenance dialysis patient .</detailed_description>
