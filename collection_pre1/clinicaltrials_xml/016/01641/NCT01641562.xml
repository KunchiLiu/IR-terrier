	<brief_title>Diagnosis Prediction Taxanes Induced Cardiac Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific context motivation . Breast cancer represent frequent form neoplasia woman worldwide , comprise 16 % neoplasia . A report World Health Organization show 1 6 cancer determine breast cancer form neoplasm cause around 550,000 deaths/year , respective 1.6 % annual deaths world . The incidence breast cancer increase , 1.1 million woman newly diagnose cancer every year . Although consider pathology specific developed country , recently establish develop country , Romania , include 69 % breast cancer . Therefore , breast cancer currently major public health economical issue research new therapy , well monitor safety use , priority . Many study show , due new chemotherapy , breast cancer consider curable disease . And indeed , use multidisciplinary approach - surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy - conduct significant reduction mortality . As consequence increase life expectancy , become essential specific oncologic therapy safe . Taxanes , inhibitor cellular mitosis ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) , relatively new drug , extremely potent widely use different therapeutic regime . Their single use association classical chemotherapy , prove increase significantly rate cure breast cancer , well reduce recurrence . However , applicability drug medium long term limit risk cardiotoxicity . Cardiotoxicity one important adverse reaction taxanes , lead important increase morbidity mortality . Cardiotoxicity appear early late course disease , may vary subclinical myocardial dysfunction irreversible heart failure even death . Recent research show cardiac dysfunction induce taxanes may increase exponentially cumulative dose use ; meanwhile , may augment associated cytotoxic drug . Data susceptibility patient develop cardiotoxicity scarce . Some study suggest patient without know cardiovascular history may develop symptomatic heart failure direct connection cumulative dose receive , affirmation lead use reduce dos chemotherapy , therefore , reduction efficiency . But also circumstance , risk cardiotoxicity induce taxanes therapy , risk foreseen cumulative dose . Moreover , cardiac alteration frequently subclinical appear early ( therapy ) , late ( first year therapy ) late ( one year finish therapy ) . Consequently , early diagnosis subclinical cardiac dysfunction patient breast cancer treat taxanes , well establishment prediction model irreversible heart failure essential management patient . Currently , recommendation diagnosis cardiac dysfunction induce taxanes use functional structural parameter conventional echocardiography , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , leave ventricular shorten fraction ( LVSF ) , well diameter volume heart chamber . However , sometime , conventional measurement allow late diagnosis cardiac dysfunction , might already irreversible . Therefore , description new simple parameter , able diagnose subtle , subclinical change cardiac function become mandatory . Recently , show myocardial velocity , cardiac deformation , parameter ventricular torsion , parameter intra- inter- ventricular dyssynchrony affect reduction LVEF LVSF . Therefore , parameter might useful early diagnosis cardiac dysfunction induce taxanes , establish prediction cardiotoxicity . Meanwhile , recently , early diagnosis cardiac dysfunction also base increase biomarkers . Some , brain natriuretic peptide , troponins , marker cardiac fibrosis inflammation , might important subclinical cardiac dysfunction induce chemotherapy , hypothesis also verify . Finally , suggest therapy taxanes might increase oxidative stress , cause endothelial dysfunction increase arterial stiffness . This might mechanisms taxanes promotes cardiac dysfunction , alteration ventriculo-arterial coupling . In conclusion , early detection cardiovascular dysfunction establish predictive model cardiotoxicity represent priority management breast cancer . This do use new ultrasound technique , assess subclinical myocardial disease ventriculo-arterial coupling , new laboratory method , assess different biomarkers oxidative stress . Objectives . The main objective project describe new parameter early diagnosis cardiovascular dysfunction patient early breast cancer , treat taxanes , define predictive model cardiotoxicity . Our hypothesis base : 1 . Taxanes ( alone combination anthracycline ) increase oxidative stress , excessive production free oxygen radical , activation neurohormonal mediator inflammation fibrosis . Decrease antioxidant capacity , genetically determine , might additional mechanism patient . Therefore , test hypothesis imbalance oxidative stress antioxidant capacity one main mechanism cardiotoxicity induce taxanes patient breast cancer . 2 . Oxidative stress determines endothelial dysfunction arterial remodeling increase arterial stiffness . We test hypothesis impair endothelial-arterial-ventricular coupling might play important role cardiotoxicity induce chemotherapy . 3 . Subclinical cardiac dysfunction diagnose look new parameter myocardial deformation torsion , time cardiac cycle . We assume parameter first affect , conventional echo parameter , cardiotoxicity induce chemotherapy . Therefore , objective study , patient early breast cancer , without cardiovascular symptom , treat taxanes ( alone combination anthracycline ) , : 1 . To assess imbalance oxidative stress antioxidant capacity order describe new potential mechanism cardiotoxicity ; 2 . To test implication genetic disorder predict cardiotoxicity , mainly decrease antioxidant capacity ; 3 . To assess endothelial-arterial-ventricular couple possible determinant cardiotoxicity ; 4 .
