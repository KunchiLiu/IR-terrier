	<brief_summary>This research do investigate patient receive commonly use sedative drug , know midazolam , likely high blood sugar level stressful period immediately surgery . A sedative drug use relax person without make sleepy . This drug also helpful reduce memory stressful experience anesthesiologists administers anesthesia . Everyone glucose sugar blood stream . This sugar give energy organ allow work . Since high blood sugar level may associate complication like wound infection , investigator research do find patient receive sedative medication prior surgical procedure lower blood sugar surgery patient receive sedation . The investigator would like know administration commonly use drug help patient maintain normal glucose level stressful period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Preop Midazolam Maintain Blood Glucose Norms Non Diabetic Perioperative Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery perform general anesthesia induces stress response partially catabolic energy state . As result , serum glucose may rise level associate major morbidity mortality . In patient undergoing cardiac surgery , typically `` tight glycemic control '' strategy use prevent hyper- hypo-glycemia perioperative period , effect perioperative hyperglycemia begin emerge . In one study high percentage patient control group intraoperative blood glucose level 225 . After one hour surgery : 20 % , two hour : 28 % , three hour : 31 % post-anesthesia recovery room : 52 % patient . These high level glucose could associate significant post-operative morbidity wound infection pneumonia show cardiac surgery population . Glucose alteration induce psychological stress study rat human . Midazolam short act benzodiazepine depress central nervous system . It indicate anxiolysis , amnesia sedation . We hypothesize administration midazolam may beneficial suppress catabolic energy state , maintain normal glucose level stressful period . This commonly available inexpensive drug , tolerate well majority patient , may useful maintain normal glucose level minimize adverse postoperative outcome , wound urinary tract infection pneumonia . We propose prospective , single blind ( subject ) randomize study measure glucose level non diabetic patient undergo ventral inguinal hernia repair . Patients schedule hernia repair approach morning surgery ( E yellow ) follow completion inform consent process , preoperative capillary glucose reading perform via portable Abbott Freestyleâ„¢ Glucometer . Subjects preoperative reading great 110 exclude study . Prior administration medication , ask subject complete State Trait Anxiety Inventory Adults ( STAI Form Y-1 Y-2 ) . This research instrument anxiety adult . It comprise 40 question 6th grade read level . It design differentiate temporary condition `` state anxiety '' long term personality trait . We determine whether subject ' perioperative glucose level correlate his/her score STAI .</detailed_description>
