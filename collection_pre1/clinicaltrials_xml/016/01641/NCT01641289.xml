	<detailed_description>Mortality severe malaria remain ~15 % despite best available parasiticidal antimalarial therapy , intravenous artesunate . Adjunctive therapy combination anti-parasitic drug potential improve outcome . However , currently prove adjunctive therapy treatment severe malaria , improve case-fatality use combination anti-parasitic drug . This research proposal focus explore paracetamol prevents renal dysfunction cause free haemoglobin induce oxidative damage severe malaria . Blackwater fever epidemiology As early 1800s , blackwater fever complicate severe malaria cause Plasmodium falciparum recognize important cause morbidity mortality , 25-30 % mean mortality rate . The etiology pathogenesis poorly understood characterize massive intravascular haemolysis passage black red urine , lead renal impairment death . This manifestation link quinine therapy occurrence nearly disappear chloroquine era 1950 1980 . Since 1990 , resurgence number case note malaria-free malarious area non-immune immune individual generate renew interest manifestation severe malaria . The large malaria clinical trial report blackwater fever incidences 7 % 4 % Asian adult patient severe malaria treat artesunate quinine , respectively 4 % African child treat either drug . The prevalence blackwater fever Chittagong , Bangladesh recently determine pilot study 15 % associate renal failure mortality rate 42.9 % 14.2 % respectively . Blackwater fever pathogenesis Although exact mechanism link falciparum malaria blackwater fever uncertain , numerous explanation suggest . It propose occur 4 specific circumstance : ( 1 ) case patient G6PD deficiency without malaria take oxidant drug ( primaquine ) ( 2 ) case patient G6PD deficiency malaria untreated treated quinine ( 3 ) patient ( normal G6PD ) severe malaria treat quinine ( 4 ) people expose malaria self-medicate quinine relate amino-alcohol drug . However , new circumstance blackwater fever emerge , occur patient normal G6PD level severe malaria receive artesunate rather quinine . Role oxidative stress free haem The fundamental characteristic blackwater fever presence massive haemolysis infect uninfected erythrocyte release free haemoglobin . The free haem highly cytotoxic , important scavenger nitric oxide , promote endothelial damage propose involved pathogenesis renal injury cerebral malaria . When degree intravascular haemolysis exceed capacity plasma haptoglobin bind haemoglobin release red blood cell , free haemoglobin filter glomeruli enters renal tubule . In series renal biopsy , fine coarse haemoglobin granule present proximal tubule , haemoglobin cast granular cast predominate distal collecting tubule patient blackwater fever intravascular haemolysis . This classic theory renal damage tubular precipitation challenge recent finding reverse oxidative property free haem prevent renal damage . The free haemoglobin present pathogenic ferrous haem oxidize ferric state ( FeIII ) subsequently confer peroxidase activity haemoglobin . Consequently , haemoglobin reduce hydroperoxides , hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) lipid hydroperoxides , generate ferryl state ( FeIV=O ) haemoglobin globin protein radical . Haem Fe ( III ) protein + H2O2 -- &gt; haem [ Fe ( IV ) =O ] proteinâ€¢ + H+ + H2O The ferryl haem protein radical generate lipid radical oxidation free phospholipid-esterified unsaturated fatty acid . The arachidonic side chain membrane phospholipid particularly vulnerable free radical-mediated damage complex cascade lipid oxidation lead generation F2-isoprostanes ( F2-IsoPs ) isofurans ( IsoFs ) . Evidence suggest F2-isoPs generate haemoprotein-catalyzed oxidation lipid responsible oxidative damage vasoconstriction associate renal injury set hemolytic disorder rhabdomyolysis . Paracetamol oxidative stress A novel mechanism paracetamol recently demonstrate , show paracetamol act potent inhibitor haemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation reduce ferryl haem less toxic ferric state quench globin radical . This effect enhance 14-fold acidic milieu . In recent proof concept trial , paracetamol therapeutic level show significantly decrease oxidant injury kidney , improve renal function reduce renal damage inhibit haemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation , mediate redox cycling haem moiety myoglobin , rat model rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury . Rationale Since adult severe malaria blackwater fever associate haemolysis demonstrate increase concentration cell-free haemoglobin , severe acidosis urinary F2-IsoPs , investigator hypothesize novel inhibitory mechanism paracetamol may provide renal protection population reduce haemoprotein-induced lipid peroxidation . As currently consensus exist concern adequate medical treatment blackwater fever , potential application safe extensively use drug would great benefit . Proposed activity The main activity propose randomise open label control study paracetamol patient severe falciparum malaria ass modulate effect renal function oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
