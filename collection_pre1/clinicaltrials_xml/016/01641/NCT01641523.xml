	<brief_summary>Multicenter , prospective , comparative , observational study regular follow-up visit . The project 's aim long-term follow-up patient affect large complex craniolacuniae treat , standard clinical practice , CustomBone Service™ Cranial ( porous bio-mimetic hydroxyapatite custom-made medical device cranioplasty ) , autologous bone polymethilmethacrylate customize prosthesis compare clinical outcome safety among three treatment . Elegibility treatment respect standard clinical practice . Each investigator respect hospital criterion cranial reconstruction . Each centre 's agreement participate study totally voluntary . The study sample size define statistical criterion : study population set 100 consecutive patient treat cranioplasty reconstruction one three foreseen group . Each investigator allow enrol 20 patient avoid enrolment imbalance centre involve . Primary study end-points : evaluation adverse event incidence surgical treatment . Secondary end-points : quality life improvement , evaluation bone continuity restoration evaluate CT scan analysis , neurological improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cranioplasty surgery necessary everytime craniolacuniae reconstruct ensure protection central nervous system . Cranioplasty surgery classify first line surgery , due traumatic event degenerative pathology , second line treatment , due first treatment failure , example autologous bone reabsorption/infection material reject . Clinical evaluation score Specific validate clinical score employ End-points evaluation . CT scan require pre-operation visit post-operation time follow visit evaluate bone-implant osteointegration process osteointegration evaluate apply specific score .
