	<brief_summary>The overall aim BREATHER trial evaluate role Short-Cycle Therapy ( SCT ) management HIV-infected young people respond well antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) determine whether young people chronic HIV infection undergo Short-Cycle Therapy five day ART two day maintain level viral load suppression continuous therapy , 48 week . To assess advantage disadvantage strategy , incidence toxicity , immunological control , resistance mutation , acceptability , quality life adherence randomise strategy also compare . Importantly , insufficient data short-term viral load rebound stop ART population , trial incorporate initial pilot phase select centre , assess safety SCT strategy evaluate detailed HIV-1 RNA profile participant SCT strategy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infect young people age 8 24 year inclusive ( Young people recruit ages 1621 must either regular physical contact clinician able transfer adult physician site followup affiliate adult site ) . Parents/carers and/or young people , applicable , willing provide inform consent . On stable firstline ART treatment contain least 2 NRTIs/NtRTIs EFV least 12 month willing continue regimen throughout study period . Young people regimens contain nevirapine ( NVP ) boost protease inhibitor undetectable viral load one year wish enrol switch EFV . Once stable EFV contain regimen 12 week may enrol ( must 2 subsequent HIV1 RNA measurement &lt; 50 c/ml minimum period 12 week ) . Previous dual therapy and/or substitution NRTIs allow provide change disease progression , immunological virological failure ( virological failure define two successive HIV1 RNA result &gt; 1000 c/ml ) subsequent virological control achieve ART . Viral suppression ( HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 c/ml ) least prior 12 month ( least last 3 measurement , include screen ) : young people experience single viral load &gt; 50 &lt; 1000 copies/ml ( precede follow VL &lt; 50 c/ml ) last 12 month enrol . CD4 cell count ≥350 106/L screen visit . Centre must routinely use assay detects HIV RNA1 viral load ≥50 c/ml . Pregnancy risk pregnancy female child bear potential . Acute illness ( young people may enrol illness ) . Receiving concomitant therapy acute illness ( young people may enrol finish therapy ) . A creatinine , AST ALT grade 3 screening . On regimen include nevirapine boost PI ( young people may switch EFV base regimen ) . Previous ART monotherapy ( except prevention mothertochild transmission )</criteria>
