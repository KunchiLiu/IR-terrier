	<brief_summary>After initial treatment differentiate thyroid cancer patient ( DTC ) follow blood test , biomarker call thyroglobulin , order detect possible recurrence . Nowadays patient treat 'blindly ' high dose radioactive iodine treat suspect recurrence . However , scan make therapy verify effect treatment show 50 % treatment could consider futile . 124I - radioactive isotope - combination whole body PET become recently available use follow-up DTC . This could make possible therapy high dose radioactive iodine determine extensiveness disease whether effect therapy could expect . Additionally , recurrent DTC lesion accumulate iodine find without futile treatment 131I . FDG-PET ( another PET modality ) able detect lesion . The value FDG-PET 131I treatment however test . The combination two diagnostic tool , 124I-PET FDG-PET , potential allow earlier well restaging selection treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) frequent endocrine tumor , annual incidence per 100.000 individual 1 - 3 men 2 - 4 woman . In general DTC good prognosis , 6 % patient die disease , prognosis less favourable disease recur primary treatment . Measurement tumor marker Thyroglobulin ( Tg ) serum play pivotal role follow-up differentiate thyroid cancer . Serum Tg undetectable DTC patient follow thyroid remnant ablation radioactive iodine-131 ( 131I ) , detectable level signal persistence ( neoplastic ) thyroid tissue . A serum Tg cut-off level â‰¥ 2 ng/ml follow rhTSH highly sensitive identifying patient persistent tumor may find . Historically follow-up patient DTC include diagnostic planar scintigraphy low dose 131I , nowadays longer recommended poor sensitivity . Instead , whole body scintigraphy blind administration high dose , 'therapeutic ' , 131I recommend , diagnose stage potential recurrence , initiate treatment . This strategy effective , estimate 38 % - 50 % patient negative post-therapeutic whole body scan and/or objective therapy effect . These patient receive total body irradiation 450 mSv potentially suffer side effect nausea , sialoadenitis , loss taste , reduce spermatogenesis . Also , prolong thyroid hormone withdrawal subsequent hypothyroidism necessary 131I therapy major impact quality life majority patient suffer significant change physical , psychological , social well-being . The high frequency high dose 131I therapy patient derive benefit expose toxicity potential adverse oncological effect , lead search new diagnostic tool improve selection patient treatment . Historically , ultrasound neck apply detect local recurrence regional lymph node metastasis , allow direct biopsy confirm diagnosis . But ultrasound limited neck , negative presence detectable Tg , form whole body evaluation require . Recently Iodine-124 ( 124I ) become available novel radionuclide whole body PET image follow-up DTC , promise diagnostic accuracy considerably low radiation exposure compare planar whole body scintigraphy high dose 131I . Furthermore , recent experience show 124I-PET image may representative biodistribution radiation dosimetry subsequent treatment high dose 131I . Thus , availability 124I-PET , might become possible accurately re-stage patient whole body procedure , perform dosimetry subsequent 131I therapy predict outcome treatment . At time , recurrent DTC lesion accumulate iodine , correlate tumor dedifferentiation poor prognosis . Patients suspect non-iodine accumulating DTC , far evident futile blind 131I therapy , require restaging local systemic therapy may instal . Metabolic PET image glucose analogon 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , stimulate rhTSH , high sensitivity recurrent DTC patient detectable Tg negative iodine scintigraphy , may correlate aggressive tumor behaviour poor prognosis , able select patient additional surgery external beam radiotherapy . This technique currently apply prior treatment image high dose 131I proven ineffective . The value FDG-PET 131I treatment test . The uptake 124iodine FDG related histopathological characteristic tumor tissue , resect primary tumor metastasis . 124I uptake related expression sodium iodine symporter ( NIS ) , FDG uptake relate hexokinase-I ( HKI ) activity . The power combine 124I-PET FDG-PET detection characterization DTC lesion suggest proof concept study . The relation image finding histopathological parameter ( thyroglobulin , TTF1 , Ki-67 Cytokeratine-19 stain ) response 131I treatment elucidate sufficiently large series . Based characteristic 124I-PET FDG-PET , reasonable assume combine strategy image histopathological evaluation time suspect recurrence yield adequate information disease stage prior treatment 131I , regardless tumor dedifferentiation , potential impact clinical decision making . This hypothesis need proper testing , increase fundamental knowledge DTC improve treatment . The multi-center design study require standard acquisition 124I-PET scan . Previously do FDG-PET Netherlands , so-called NEDPAS protocol . In order compare scan center calibration standardization 124I-PET scan prior start study do . Additional objective study aim answer whether thyroid hormone withdrawal rhTSH preparation 124I-PET result different scan result . In summary , high dose 131I treatment recurrent DTC effective many case , current blind approach also lead overtreatment , delay , unnecessary decrease quality life significant number case . As show , combination diagnostic test potential allow earlier well restaging selection treatment . The propose trial aim test value optimal implementation new test , standalone combination , derive parameter new personalised strategy diagnosis treatment patient ( suspect ) recurrent DTC .</detailed_description>
