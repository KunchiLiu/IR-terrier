	<brief_summary>This multi-national , randomize , double-blind , 3-period crossover , incomplete block design evaluate 5 once-daily 2 twice-daily dos GSK573719 combination placebo . The study explore dose range GSK573719 asthmatic subject currently use non-ICS controller medication . Subjects participate study maximum 14 week . At randomization subject stratify age ensure adequate exposure GSK573719 throughout expect age range . The primary endpoint trough FEV1 obtain 24 hour last morning dose Day 14 treatment sequence . A sub-group subject select site ( approximately 30 % total population ) additional serial assessment spirometry , ECG Holter , pharmacokinetic sample start end treatment period . Safety assessment include monitor adverse event , laboratory test , asthma symptom assessment twice daily PEF evaluation . Consenting subject blood sample take pharmacogenetic analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 3-period Crossover Study With GSK573719 Monotherapy Adult Subjects With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma , reversible obstructive disease airway , define chronic inflammatory disorder airways many cell cellular mediator play role . The chronic inflammation associate airway hyper-responsiveness lead recurrent episode wheezing , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough , particularly night early morning . These episode usually associate widespread , variable airflow obstruction within lung often reversible either spontaneously treatment ( NIH 2007 , GINA , 2010 , ) . Guidelines recommend stepwise approach management asthma . For many patient mild disease , asthma symptom adequately relieve 'on demand ' use short act beta-2 -agonist ( SABA ) alone . A long-acting , inhaled , muscarinic receptor antagonist ( LAMA ) exert effect via distinct complementary bronchodilator mechanism large small airway antagonism endogenous agonist acetylcholine muscarinic receptor lead smooth muscle relaxation bronchodilation . However , experience old anti-cholinergics acute use little known effect chronic use maintenance asthma . Newer selective muscarinic receptor antagonist develop chronic use appear well adverse event profile compare old anti-cholinergics treatment asthma [ Moulton 2011 ] . A daily long-acting , inhale , muscarinic receptor antagonist ( LAMA ) bronchodilator , GSK573719 , may offer alternative treatment option patient asthma . The propose study multi-national , randomize , double-blind , 3-period crossover , incomplete block study outpatient subject mild asthma use inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) symptom control . The primary objective study evaluate dose response , efficacy safety five once-daily dos GSK573719 compare placebo , 14-day treatment period , patient asthma . A placebo arm include determine absolute treatment effect placebo GSK573719 dose regimen . Each eligible subject randomize receive 3 8 potential treatment sequence total three 14-day treatment period . There 12 clinic visit include safety follow-up visit end study . All subject provide albuterol ( salbutamol ) use 'as-needed ' basis throughout run-in , treatment washout period . A sub-group ( approximately 30 % ) study population comprise subject select site . These subject additional assessment start end treatment period , include serial spirometry , serial ECGs , 24 hour Holter monitoring , sample blood urine pharmacokinetic analysis . Other safety parameter include incidence adverse event , vital sign , clinical laboratory parameter , ECGs spirometry , include twice daily peak expiratory flow , asthma exacerbation assessment . use salbutamol .</detailed_description>
