	<brief_summary>The study do : - test strategy use resistance test choose anti-HIV drug . Resistance test look HIV blood see drug might work best low HIV infection . - see well combinations new anti-HIV drug work low HIV infection - see take new anti-HIV drug together safe tolerable - see text message improve people 's anti-HIV drug-taking behavior ( sit adherence study ) - people take certain combination anti-HIV drug anti-TB drug , compare drug act body - Step 3 , see people stop frequent clinic visit part research study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Step 1 : HIV1 infection Any previous combination ARV treatment time least one regimen contain one NNRTI two NRTIs replace PIbased regimen virologic , immunologic , clinical treatment failure , toxicity . NOTE : All potential participant prior RAL exposure assign Cohort D. Current receipt PIbased regimen regimen change minimum 24 week prior screen . NOTE A : Within 30 day prior collection confirmatory VF sample , alteration dose , dose frequency , withinclass substitution ( ) intolerance permit , drug interruption fewer 7 cumulative day . NOTE B : There change drug interruption within 3 day immediately prior collection confirmatory VF sample . Confirmation VF current secondline PIbased ART . NOTE A : Failure current secondline regimen define two consecutive measurement plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL obtain least 1 day apart current PIbased regimen . NOTE B : The first measurement plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must obtain least 24 week current PIbased regimen within 240 day prior study entry . This measurement may obtain local laboratory medical record regardless laboratory performed test . NOTE C : The second measurement plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must obtain within 103 day prior study entry must perform DAIDSapproved laboratory . CD4+ Tcell count result specimen draw within 103 day prior study entry ; date specimen draw CD4+ Tcell count must record . Certain laboratory value obtain within 30 day prior study entry . Females reproductive potential ( woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , ie , menses within precede 24 month , woman undergo surgical sterilization , hysterectomy bilateral salpingectomy bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 48 hour prior randomization registration . Female participant reproductive potential must agree participate conception process ( ie , active attempt become pregnant , vitro fertilization ) , participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female participant must use least one reliable form contraceptive . Potential female participant must continue use contraceptive receive study treatment 6 week stop study treatment . Female participant reproductive potential whose male partner ( ) document azoospermia ) require use contraceptive . Any statement selfreported sterility partner 's must enter source document . NOTE : Acceptable documentation lack reproductive potential oral write documentation participant . Karnofsky performance score &gt; /= 70 within 30 day prior study entry . Ability willingness potential participant provide inform consent . Willingness potential participant adhere protocol requirement , especially respect treatment assignment ability obtain nonstudy provided ART , need . Ability take oral study medication . No intention permanent relocation would preclude attend Step 1 2 study followup visit . Availability successful , interpretable resistance genotype report DAIDSapproved regional genotyping facility test perform plasma sample collect screening ( ie , date sample collect confirm HIV1 virologic failure ) ship regional resistance test laboratory documentation two screen plasma HIV1 RNA value ≥1000 copies/mL available . NOTE : A repeat test original sample acceptable initial genotype result available due technical reason . Identification cohort assignment ARV regimen use study , select recommend option provide site investigator , review approve A5288 CMC . NOTE : The final CMCapproved cohort ( A , B , C , D ) plan ARV regimen must enter enrollment system , ACS , keep hardcopy source documentation site . Exclusion Criteria Step 1 : Pregnancy breastfeeding . Known allergy/sensitivity hypersensitivity component study drug formulation . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization candidate either completes therapy clinically stable therapy , opinion site investigator , least 7 day prior study entry . Concurrent illness condition would compromise ability take study medication , follow protocol , would make participation best interest participant , per site investigator . Requirement take prohibited medication select ARV study regimen , within 14 day prior study entry . Active tuberculosis ( TB ) rifampin exposure le 2 week prior study entry .</criteria>
