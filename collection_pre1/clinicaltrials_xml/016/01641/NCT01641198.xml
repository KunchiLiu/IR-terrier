	<brief_summary>Between 1992 1996 , 58 subject enrol randomise , short long term superiority single centre prospective clinical trial . Each subject randomly assign receive 5 mandibular endosseous implant 3 type ( B , SW , SC ) . All subject age 25 56 year , excellent physical mental health , non smoker , take prescribed medication , suffer TMJ facial pain abnormality treat complete removable dental prosthesis jaw least one year . All subject skeletal class I intermaxillary relationship least 1 cm bone height superior inferior cortical table well least 6 mm . buccal-lingual bone width anterior mandibular region mental foramen . All subject type 2 and/or type 3 mandibular bone quality area specifically request fixed complete dental prosthesis mandibular implant accompany conventional complete removable maxillary prosthesis . Standardized radiographs osseous heal around abutment-implant interface take 12 month prostheses insertion take presently future 15 year prostheses insertion use standardize protocol equipment . The 3 implant type , B , SW SC , approve commercially available North America . They parallel , screw endosseous compose commercially pure titanium . Two implant type almost identical design except one implant type ( SW ) acid etch microtextured surface versus smooth , machine non acid etch surface ( B ) . The third implant type ( SC ) posse similar design others smooth-surfaced collar narrower longer smooth surface collar B SW implant type identical . The SC implant type also acid etch microtextured surface identical SW implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For subject , 3 implant type ( B , SW , SC ) place surgeon 5 mandibular surgical site site receive different implant . A computer generate randomised protocol know surgeon implant placement assure subject receive 3 implant type 3 different surgical site first , follow cyclical insertion 2 3 implant type remain 2 surgical site . Therefore , much possible , equal number 3 implant type randomly place 5 different mandibular surgical site . As well , assure 29 subject would receive 3 implant leave parasymphyseal area remain 29 subject would receive 3 implant right parasymphyseal area . In , 58 subject , 29 female receive 290 mandibular implant . As closely possible 6 month follow date , per accept surgical protocol time , implant expose . Healing abutment plastic cap place along non resorbable surgical dressing . Subjects treat complete fix dental prosthesis mandibular implant well complete removable conventional dental prosthesis maxilla responsibility supervision prosthodontist . Standardized periapical radiograph allow quantitative measurement alveolar bone healing leave right side abutment-implant junction 12 month follow prosthesis insertion . Original measurement 12 month function retake sample number subject inter evaluator intra evaluator statistical analysis perform . Results 12 month function submit . Following , present clinical study undertaken measure quantitative alveolar bone healing leave right side abutment-implant junction 15 year prostheses insertion . Original standardized radiographic technique measurement protocol use 12 month evaluation period use examine many original subject possible use present day ethical consent protocol . Hypothesis : The purpose prospective superiority trial test hypothesis acid etch microtextured implant 's surface 1-3Âµm favorable influence quantitative osseous heal around function implant compare smoother machine implant similar design .</detailed_description>
