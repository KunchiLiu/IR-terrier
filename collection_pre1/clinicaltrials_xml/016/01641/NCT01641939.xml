	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , adaptive Phase II/III study evaluate efficacy safety trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) compare standard taxane ( docetaxel paclitaxel ) treatment participant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive advanced gastric cancer . At start trial ( stage 1 ) , participant randomize ratio 2:2:1 one three treatment arm : Arm A : trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) per intravenous injection ( IV ) every 3 week ; Arm B : trastuzumab emtansine 2.4 mg/kg IV every week ; Arm C : standard taxane therapy ( docetaxel 75 milligram per meter square [ mg/m^2 ] IV every 3 week paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 kg IV every week per investigator choice ) . At end first stage study , dose schedule trastuzumab emtansine use second stage study select Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) . The regimen selection analysis make approximately 100 participant across three study arm treat least 12 week . Once trastuzumab emtansine regimen select , Stage I participant assign treatment arm select Stage II study participant standard taxane group continue receive assign treatment regimen . Stage I participant assign regimen select evaluation continue receive assign regimen continue follow efficacy safety . In Stage II study , additional participant recruit randomized ratio 2:1 either select regimen trastuzumab emtansine standard taxane therapy . Participants receive study treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , initiation another cancer therapy withdrawal .</brief_summary>
