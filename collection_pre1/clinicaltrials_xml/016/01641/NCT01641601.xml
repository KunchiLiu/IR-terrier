	<detailed_description>Labor induction common procedure among pregnant patient term . This process involve period cervical preparation ( `` ripen '' ) woman `` unfavorable '' cervical examination time labor induction schedule . Cervical ripening may take place pharmacologic mechanical strategy , time traditionally administer inpatient basis . This process 24 hour , result lengthy hospitalization associate cost frustration patient L &amp; D staff . The propose study randomize , control trial explore follow research question : Among woman full-term pregnancy require labor induction , pre-hospital , outpatient cervical ripen reduce amount inpatient time need achieve delivery compare pre-hospital cervical ripening ? As secondary objective , also wish explore outpatient cervical ripen acceptable patient . This study involve randomize eligible consent woman schedule labor induction obstetrical provider pre-hospital cervical ripening ( intervention ) group pre-hospital ripening ( control ) group . A trans-cervical Foley balloon ( TCFB ) use outpatient pre-hospital cervical ripen woman randomize intervention group . No pre-hospital ripening performed woman control group . Both group admit induction schedule undergo labor induction accord specify , Bishop-score base induction protocol , may may include TCFB . We compare duration inpatient stay admission delivery group well satisfaction pre-hospital period labor delivery experience . Maternal neonatal outcome also compare two group .</detailed_description>
