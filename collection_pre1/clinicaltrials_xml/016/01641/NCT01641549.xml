	<brief_summary>Malfunction mechanical heart valve due clot formation potentially devastating complication . It often result heart failure , death stroke . This condition occur frequently patient mechanical valve develop country unable monitor adjust dose blood thin medication . The best treatment modality treatment patient condition know . There reliable data clinical trial guide treatment firm guideline . Treatment clot-busting drug commonly use drug ( e.g. , streptokinase ) readily available , cheap , easy use . However , treatment associate high rate treatment-related side-effects ( death , life-threatening bleed stroke ) . Moreover , recent study suggest clot-busting drug may efficacious restore valve function , previously believe . Emergency surgery less often use expensive require facility manpower available time place . But evidence suggest surgery result well success rate low risk bleed stroke . Well-designed prospective randomise trial ( `` gold-standard '' reliable evidence ) compare efficacy , safety cost-effectiveness two modality , need help doctor develop country make informed decision treat patient clotted mechanical heart valve . The investigator propose perform randomise control trial compare emergency surgery treatment clot-busting agent patient clot mechanical valve . The study conduct 4 year single , university hospital develop country . This study determine often patient treat surgery discharge hospital , completely restore valve function , without suffered stroke life-threatening bleeding , compare receive clot-busting drug . The investigator also find treatment safe cost-effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Versus Fibrinolytic Therapy Left-sided Prosthetic Heart Valve Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis ( PVT ) potentially devastating complication affect patient mechanical heart valve . It occur frequently develop country poor anticoagulation quality . The best modality treat condition know . Most available data retrospective study case series , current guideline base largely expert opinion . Therefore recommendation treatment vary widely . Fibrinolytic therapy ( FT ) commonly use treatment fibrinolytic agent streptokinase readily available , cheap , easy use . However , FT associate high rate treatment-related adverse effect ( death , major bleed stroke ) . Moreover , recent study suggest FT may efficacious restore valve function , previously believe . Emergency surgery less often use expensive require facility manpower available time place . A systematic review meta-analysis available literature investigator perform , suggest surgery may result good success rate low risk major bleeding , stroke non-CNS systemic embolism . Evidence well design randomise control trial need determine optimal treatment left-sided PVT . The investigator propose single-centre , open-label , randomise control trial compare emergency surgery FT treatment symptomatic patient left-sided PVT . The primary outcome occurrence complete clinical response , define discharge hospital completely restore valve function , absence stroke , major bleed non-CNS systemic embolism . The investigator compare safety two intervention quality life discharge 1 year . The investigator also assess cost-effectiveness surgery compare FT societal perspective context Indian healthcare system</detailed_description>
