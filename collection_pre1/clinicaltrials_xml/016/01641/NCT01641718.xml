	<brief_summary>Inguinal hernia repair belong common surgical procedure worldwide . Increasingly perform use endoscopical technique ( laparoscopy ) . Many surgeon prefer cover hernia gap mesh prevent recurrence . For , mesh must fix tightly , tension free . During laparoscopic surgery mesh fix commonly staple tissue glue . However , uncommon staple cause pain staple sit move . In addition , staple cause scar abdominal wall lead chronic pain . Aim study provide evidence mesh fixation tissue glue cause less postoperative pain compare fixation staple . Patients unilateral inguinal hernia randomize receive either mesh fixation tissue glue staple ( ratio 1:1 ) . Patients bilateral inguinal hernia receive mesh fixation tissue glue one side staple fixation side . The side treat tissue glue randomize ( ratio 1:1 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>______________________________________________ The inguinal hernia common hernia , include 90 % spontaneous hernia , inguinal hernia repair frequently perform procedure general surgery . In United States 700,000 inguinal hernia repair annually Germany 200,000 . The standard method inguinal hernia repair , originally describe Bassini 1889 , closure inguinal canal use suture . Due high recurrence rate technique , method use tension-free implantation synthetic mesh establish . Furthermore , endoscopic/laparoscopy method establish , hernia canal usually approach posterior side opposite anterior site open approach . It still hotly debate approach method best . Among various posterior technique use preperitoneal mesh implantation , transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair ( TAPP ) total extraperitoneal ( TEP ) repair achieve high acceptance . There many indication use technique , TAPP recommend especially recurrent hernia ( open preperitoneal patch plastic ) difficult hernia ( slide incarcerate hernia ) . The advantage TAPP easy perform , good possibility standardization , offer option perform diagnostic laparoscopy . Thus , type hernia assess immediately side bilateral repair perform without additional incision . In general , learn TAPP easy TEP . Most randomized study compare laparoscopic open repair find follow result laparoscopy : reduce postoperative pain , early return work , increased cost , increase operating time , longer learn period , early learning phase increase recurrence complication rate . In summary open , mesh-based , tension-free repair remain standard , laparoscopic herniorrhaphy , hand adequately trained surgeon , produce excellent result comparable open repair . Whether patient suffer postoperative pain depend many factor like type intervention , complication , age , individual tolerance . In particular type mesh fixation employ hernioplasty strong influence postoperative pain . In recent review mesh fixation glue compare mesh fixation stapler endoscopic inguinal hernia repair ( Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech ( 2010 ) 20:205 ) . For transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair two randomize control trial , one non randomize trial two case series identify review . Although author find reduced postoperative pain faster recovery glue fixation without significant difference recurrence rate , author still conclude : `` As overall quality publish data remain poor , well-designed study need fibrin seal replace mechanical staple new standard mesh fixation . '' Thus well design randomize study compare glue vs. staple fixation TAPP still warrant . Most previous study apply one mesh fixation method patient bilateral hernia . Only one study compare glue stapler fixation single patient bilateral hernia . In study 2x2 design use , compare two fixation method patient unilateral hernia well compare two method patient bilateral hernia , eliminate interindividual bias single hernia group . Furthermore study focus early postoperative pain , rather thorough coverage first 2 day . In many study first time pain measure one month surgery , last time point study . The main aim trial investigate early postoperative pain laparoscopic hernia repair TAPP technique use either fibrin glue staple mesh fixation .</detailed_description>
