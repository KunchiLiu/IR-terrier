	<brief_summary>Drug resistance result emergence Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clone significant problem Ph positive ALL patient good initial response one TKI inhibitor , many patient relapse within one year , relapse almost always associate BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutation . The patient relapse treatment one TKI rescue remission another TKI , second remission usually shorter previous one . A potent TKI inhibitor , pan-active BCR-ABL variant ( include second generation TKI resistant T315I mutant ) , also others molecular target well . In context , Ponatinib novel synthetic orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , specifically developed inhibit BCR-ABL , fusion protein product Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) subset acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Ph+ ALL ) . It potently inhibit BCR-ABL protein well mutate form protein arise patient resistant prior therapy TKIs . Ponatinib demonstrate inhibit mutation detect far , vitro vivo uniformly suppress emerge single-mutant clone mutagenesis assay . In Phase II study , 41 % Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient treat Ponatinib achieve major hematologic response , 47 % major cytogenetic response , 38 % obtain complete cytogenetic response , show Ponatinib provide significant benefit despite previous intolerance refractoriness TKIs . The Phase I trial show patient recent diagnosis increase rate major molecular response : 79 % 14 patient 0 5 year since diagnosis vs. 29 % 14 patient 5 9 year since diagnosis ( P=0.02 ) 27 % 15 patient 9 24 year since diagnosis ( P=0.009 ) . These characteristic support hypothesis role Ponatinib patient resistant prior TKI therapy also untreated ALL Ph+ patient , order prevent emergence resistant cause selection mutate Ph+ clone order avoid rapid progression disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Front-line Ponatinib Adult Philadelphia+/BCR-ABL+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , phase 2 , single arm unblinded trial oral Ponatinib patient Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia . Patients receive daily oral administration Ponatinib dose 45 mg/day 6 week ( defined one course ) 8 course , dose schedule , total 48 week . Each patient follow subsequent 24 month , every 3 month , provide survival information monitor serious adverse event . Each patient treat minimum 6 week . Then patient discontinue follow situation : - end first course ( 6 week ) , case lack CHR ; - end third course ( 18 week ) , case lack CCgR ; - time case loss CHR CCgR . If remain therapy 48 week , able continue treatment extension phase study , interest patient , allow receive treatment interest . For patient remain trial , response , outcome toxicity follow subsequent 24 months.The 6-weeks periodicity must rigidly respect , irrespective temporary discontinuation study drug ( eg , patient take Ponatinib 4 week remain off-treatment subsequent two week AE , 7th week begin patient restart Ponatinib second course , per protocol ) . Prednisone ( P ) administer patient 7-14 day , Ponatinib , make possible wait result cytogenetic molecular test , evaluate response P alone , hence another 21 day . Intrathecal therapy ( IT ) MTX/AraC/DEX mandatory , every 28 day , patient without clinical-cytologic evidence meningeal involvement . In patient CNS disease , IT perform twice weekly complete clearance cerebrospinal fluid blast cell achieve , hence weekly 4 week , hence monthly .</detailed_description>
