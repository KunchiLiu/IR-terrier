	<brief_summary>The fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) capecitabine ( Cp ) among commonly use anticancer drug . Still , much controversy correct dosing , fact minority patient experience severe , sometimes even lethal toxicity follow treatment . One important factor predispose patient severe toxicity deficiency 5FU-catabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) . Our group identify 4 DPD risk alleles 300 Swiss cancer patient , result 8-times increased risk experience severe toxicity 5FU Cp . In patient receive 5FU continuous infusion , accumulate data keep AUC 5FU 20-30 mg*h/L beneficial term treatment toxicity activity . In study , patient carry least 1/4 DPD risk allele receive 50 % dose reduction either 5FU Cp , potential later dose increase abscence severe toxicity . Additionally , patient receive i.v . 5FU undergo therapeutic drug monitor end 2-day continuous infusion , subsequent dose adaptation target 5FU AUC 20-30 mg*h/L . The primary study objective reduce incidence severe treatment-related toxicity 13 % ( historical control ) 5 % study patient .</brief_summary>
