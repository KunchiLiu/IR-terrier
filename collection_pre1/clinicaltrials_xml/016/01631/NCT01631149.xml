	<brief_summary>Rationale : A deep neuromuscular block often associate improved surgical condition especially laparoscopic surgery . However , deep block come expense variety item may conflict use deep surgical muscle blockade include long recovery phase , need muscle reversal , postoperative ventilation , impaired postoperative breathing . With introduction Sugammadex possibility reverse even deep surgical block . This may overcome issue mention . Objective : To assess whether deep neuromuscular block provide well surgical condition moderately deep block derive surgical rating score . Study design : Single center , double-blind randomize controlled trial . Study population : 24 ASA I-III patient schedule laparoscopic renal ( n=12 , GROUP 1 ) prostatic surgery ( n=12 , GROUP 2 ) . Intervention : In GROUP 1 GROUP 2 , 6 six patient receive neuromuscular blockade accord current practice ( atracurium ( bolus ) plus mivacurium ( cont . infusion ) ) aim moderately deep neuromuscular block ( 1-2 twitch Train Four ( TOF ) monitor ) . The six receive bolus plus continuous infusion rocuronium aim deep neuromuscular block ( 1-2 twitch post tetanic count ( PTC ) ) . All surgical procedure perform one surgeon . Main study parameters/endpoints : To study surgical condition patient undergo laparoscopic renal prostate surgery deep versus less deep neuromuscular block assess surgical rating score . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Compared current practice additional risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical condition laparoscopic surgery largely determine degree neuromuscular relaxation surgery . Especially procedure confine narrow working field renal prostatic laparoscopic surgery , deep neuromuscular relaxation may beneficial . Until recently however , deep neuromuscular block ( 1-2 twitch post tetanic count ) come expense variety item conflict use . Occurrence postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade deep neuromuscular block common adverse event . Residual neuromuscular block risk factor develop airway obstruction pulmonary complication pneumonia atelectasis . The use acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , like neostigmine , traditional neuromuscular blocking reversal agent , slow onset action . Side effect due muscarine receptor stimulation bradycardia , hypersalivation , nausea vomiting . Coadministration muscarine agonist like atropine often necessary address heart rate-related side effect neostigmine . Atropine , however , may induce side effect . Rapid , safe complete reversal neuromuscular blockade possible discovery Sugammadex . Sugammadex modify y-cyclodextrin . It develop selectively bind free plasma rocuronium , non-depolarizing steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent . By bind free rocuronium , less rocuronium become available neuromuscular junction bind muscarine receptor . Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA 's ) block muscarine receptor neuromuscular junction , make unavailable acetylcholine base signal transmission . Sugammadex proven rapidly safely reverse rocuronium vecuronium . Even high dose rocuronium ( 1.2 mg/kg continuous rocuronium infusion use achieve deep neuromuscular blockade safely reverse Sugammadex . Theoretically , availability Sugammadex make possible use deep neuromuscular block ( DNB ) surgery improve surgical condition without occurrence above-mentioned adverse event . The use DNB improve surgical condition , however , yet evaluate . The investigator therefore aim investigate use rocuronium induced-DNB renal prostatic laparoscopic surgery . Current anesthesiologic practice procedure LUMC consist intravenous ( propofol ) volatile ( sevoflurane ) anesthetic combine mivacurium atracurium achieve moderately deep neuromuscular block ( 0-2 twitch TOF ) . Reversal NMB neostigmine atropine combination . In current study investigator assess effect DNB ( 1-2 twitch post tetanic count ) use continuous rocuronium infusion surgical condition . After surgery Sugammadex 4 mg/kg use safely rapidly reverse neuromuscular blockade within 5-min . The main end-point study effect deep block surgical condition . The investigator study condition use two method . ( 1 ) Assessment surgical condition operate surgeon ( surgery perform one surgeon ) , use 5-point rating surgical rating scale 1 ( = extremely poor surgical condition ) 5 = optimal surgical condition . ( 2 ) Video image , use surgeon perform surgery , rat team surgical non-surgical expert . Apart additional scoring data , approach allow validation surgical rating scale . Minor end-points study ( 1 ) measurement hemodynamics surgery use non-invasive cardiac output blood pressure device . Assuming intra-abdominal pressure affect venous return hence cardiac output surgery , deep neuromuscular block might affect hemodynamic parameter positively ; ( 2 ) measurement respiration , pain , alertness recovery room ass whether reversal Sugammadex influence parameter positively compare neostigmine/atropine reversal .</detailed_description>
