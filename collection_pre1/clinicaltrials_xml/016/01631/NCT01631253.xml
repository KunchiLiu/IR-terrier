	<brief_title>The Impact Ovarian Reserve After Single-port , Two-port , Four-port Access Laparoscopic Ovarian Cyst Enucleation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With recent development surgical instrument technique , minimally invasive surgery feasible various field surgery . Laparoscopic surgery potential benefit decrease patient discomfort , short hospital stay , superior cosmetic result decrease convalescence time . Recently , various effort continue minimally invasive surgery , one recently emerge concept single port surgery . Several study demonstrate single-port laparoscopic surgery feasible safe gynecology . However , limit could occur , occurrence less freedom degree instrument limit surgical vision , thus limit surgeon 's movement . So , two-port laparoscopy combine access umbilical additional suprapubic incision use report . In case single port access laparoscopic ovarian cyst enucleation , due limit surgeon 's movement , cyst enucleation bipolar electrocoagulation ovarian parenchyma adversely affect ovarian function . Some study report laparoscopic cyst enucleation , show marked reduction ovarian function compare surgery laparotomy . Therefore attempt investigate impact single port laparoscopy limit surgical procedure ovarian reserve ovarian cyst enucleation . To evaluate ovarian reserve change , use anti-mullerian hormone . It produce granulosa cell preantral small antral follicle recently acknowledge useful , reliable , sensitive hormonal serum marker ovarian primordial follicle pool . In addition , AMH level represent strong independent marker ovarian reserve without significant fluctuation menstrual cycle , progressively decrease age . Therefore , prospective study perform compare difference ovarian reserve single-port , two-port , four-port access laparoscopic ovarian cyst enucleation base serum anti mullerian hormone change . Serum anti mullerian hormone measure preoperative postoperative 1week , 1 3 month .</detailed_description>
