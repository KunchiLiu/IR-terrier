	<brief_title>Vismodegib Treating Patients With Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The percent reduction surgical defect area/size surround BCC tumor pre post-vismodegib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Bread-loafing histology use determine tumor vismodegib shrink one discrete lesion ( contiguous ) vs. skip area ( non-contiguous ) II . The percent reduction tumor size pre post-vismodegib . III . Safety , tolerability percent drop-out 3 vs. 6 month vismodegib otherwise healthy patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 3 month initial BCC size &lt; 2 cm superficial 6 month initial BCC size &gt; = 2 cm non-superficial . After completion vismodegib treatment , patient undergo Mohs surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
