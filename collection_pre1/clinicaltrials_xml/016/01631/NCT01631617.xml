	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - The use antibiotic revolutionize medicine , yet impact antimicrobial human microbiome incompletely understood . - Antimicrobial treatment , include topical systemic antibiotic , highly effective frequently use manage disease flare AD . Concomitant use dilute bleach bath reduce clinical severity AD patient clinical sign bacterial skin infection . - The longitudinal impact various antimicrobial human microbiome , particularly skin , systematically investigate . OBJECTIVES : Primary : -To characterize microbiome alteration healthy adult volunteer ( Cohorts 1 2 ) patient AD ( Cohort 3 ) antimicrobial treatment . ELIGIBILITY : - All subject must co-enrolled NIH protocol 08-HG-0059 - ( Cohorts 1 2 ) Healthy volunteer age 18 50 year history AD - ( Cohort 1 2 ) No prior use systemic antibiotic precede 12 month - ( Cohort 3 ) Subjects 2-50 year atopic dermatitis symptom active bacterial infection - ( Cohort 3 ) Objective SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ) score great equal 15 indicate moderate-to-severe disease DESIGN : - A prospective , interventional , longitudinal study examine change microbiome result randomize , placebo-controlled , investigator-blinded antimicrobial treatment . - Subjects Cohort 1 randomize take one 4 open label antibiotic regimen . - Subjects Cohort 2 randomize one four possible blind treatment combination study baths antibiotic . - Subjects Cohort 3 randomize cephalexin regimen without study bath . - All subject undergo longitudinal microbiome sampling . - AD patient undergo clinical assessment determine response skin infection treatment .</detailed_description>
