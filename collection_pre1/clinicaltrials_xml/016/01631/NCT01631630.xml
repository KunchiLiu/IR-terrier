	<brief_summary>Background : - Drinking much alcohol injure cell body . Inflammation body reaction injured cell . Studies show inflammation cause craving alcohol . Researchers want see pioglitazone , drug decrease inflammation , reduce alcohol craving . If , might help develop new way help alcoholic crave . Objectives : - To see pioglitazone reduce alcohol craving . Eligibility : - Adults 21 65 year age alcoholic drinking within past month . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample also collect . - All participant inpatient treatment National Institutes Health Clinical Center 5 week study . They standard treatment alcoholism inpatient stay . - Half people study pioglitazone . The half placebo . - Participants different study stay . These study include follow : - Personalized audio recording stressful , alcohol-related , neutral event monitor mood - Imaging study test alcohol craving - Questionnaires mood alcohol craving - Lumbar puncture collect spinal fluid - Inflammation test see study drug block alcohol craving - After end 5-week study , participant offer follow-up outpatient care Clinical Center , referral outside treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Proinflammatory Signaling Alcohol Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective present study evaluate role proinflammatory signal alcohol craving . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARy ) agonist pioglitazone , modulate glial activity , use experimental treatment . Guided imagery auditory script use establish set stimulus induce crave . Low dose lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) administration activate proinflammatory signal use novel challenge , evaluate ability provoke alcohol craving . If LPS fact induces alcohol craving , present design allow evaluation whether pioglitazone inhibit response . Study population : Up 60 subject recruit target accrual 50 completers . Subjects age 21-65 year , alcohol dependence primary complaint , without serious medical psychiatric condition . They admit NIAAA research inpatient unit NIH Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) one screening protocol ( 05-AA-0121 Assessment Treatment People Alcohol Drinking Problems ) 14-AA-0181 `` Unit Clinic Evaluations , Screening , Assessment , Management '' ) provide basic assessment standard withdrawal treatment need . Design : Following inclusion , subject undergo interview construction guide imagery script , script subsequently use stress- , alcohol- neutral condition associate stimulus . Subjects randomize pioglitazone ( n=25 ; final dose : 45mg/daily ) identically look placebo ( n=25 ) . Following least two week treatment , subject undergo three session guide imagery , separate day counter-balanced order , expose personalize stress- , alcohol- neutral condition associate auditory script , respectively . During final week , subject undergo two challenge session , minimum five day apart , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) placebo , counterbalance order . Outcome measure : Subjective rating mood , anxiety craving obtain twice weekly throughout study . During challenge session utilize psychological stimulus LPS , subjective rating crave alcohol , well rating negative emotion obtain . Lumbar puncture perform cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtain determine effect pioglitazone level proinflammatory cytokine . Neuroendocrine , psychological physiological measure collect exploratory purpose . An fMRI scan obtain evaluate effect pioglitazone BOLD signal response emotionally salient visual cue .</detailed_description>
