	<brief_summary>The aim project create fear conditioning paradigm within relative strength various novel pharmacological behavioral intervention test . These intervention intend reduce fearfulness associate fear condition block memory process know reconsolidation . In fear conditioning , `` condition '' stimulus ( CS ) pair aversive `` unconditioned '' stimulus ( US ) electric shock , presentation CS alone come elicit fear condition response ( CR ) . The investigator hypothesize use highly prepared CS ( i.e . video spider ) ; sensitive subject ( individual strong acquire CRs ) ; additional experimental probe presence latent CR , investigator may develop normal human paradigm plague previously observe floor effect ( i.e . intervention 100 % effective ) , within establish technique propranolol delay extinction produce significant , partial , CR reduction . This would leave room test compare potentially powerful candidate reconsolidation-blocking memory-updating intervention . To achieve aim , subject undergo four-day fear condition delay extinction protocol . Skin conductance response data gather across different phase experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 1.1 . Reconsolidation modification . Recent animal research suggest reactivation ( retrieval ) consolidate memory return labile state must restabilized order persist . This stabilization process term `` reconsolidation , '' various behavioral pharmacologic intervention find modify block . Although extinction reduce even apparently eliminate condition fear , typically inhibit expression fear memory , erase . In contrast , blockade reconsolidation believe erase , least diminish , fear memory trace . It uncommon reconsolidation article conclude statement offer novel therapeutic possibility PTSD , may part characterize disorder over-consolidated , persistently disturb memory go away.1 2 . SPECIFIC AIM The aim project create experimental assay form optimal Pavlovian differential fear conditioning paradigm , within relative strength various novel pharmacological behavioral , reconsolidation-blocking intervention test . As impressive Kindt8 Schiller10 study demonstrate pharmacological behavioral fear reconsolidation-blocking intervention normal human , result produce intervention make nearly useless potential assay reconsolidation blockade . Specifically , intervention produce apparent total abolition fear memory , i.e. , contain floor effect . The aim work develop normal human paradigm within propranolol delay extinction produce significant , partial reduction CR , might improve upon powerful reconsolidation-blocking intervention . This study use support label , advertising , indication change propanolol , prescribe patient population , route administration , dosage significantly increase risk . 2.1 . Elements new design eliminate floor effect 2.1.1 . A strong US . One way produce CR resistant reconsolidation blockade , i.e. , reduce floor effect , would use strong US . However , ongoing human conditioning study , already use electric shock select advance subject `` highly annoy painful , '' believe use level shock would ethically impermissible , hence pursue possibility . 2.1.2 . A highly `` prepared '' CS . It long show certain class CSs , pair US , produce strong fear CR , i.e. , `` prepared '' enter association US.13 The Schiller design10 use prepare CS , Kindt study8 , viz. , still picture spider . In design , enhance preparedness CS use 12-sec.14 high-definition video clip three different crawl tarantula , conspicuously different appearance . Importantly , however , present project study spider fear phobia ; use high-definition videoto enhance CS preparedness . 2.1.3 . More sensitive subject . We limit recruitment subject candidate fall within upper half distribution normal human Spider Phobia Questionnaire-1515 ( SPQ-15 ) CSs likely especially salient . However order avoid potential adverse clinical consequence participation , exclude subject feature diagnosable spider phobia ( presence Axis I mental disorder ) . 2.1.4 . Selecting subject strong CRs . In order subject complete Day 1 Acquisition phase experiment proceed remain phase , require show strong evidence conditioning , manifest CRs great 0.25 µSiemens least two CS+s . The Schiller study10 employ differential condition cut-off 0.10 µSiemens , base upon experience , favor raw score cut-off . The Kindt study8 employ cut-off . 2.1.5 . Employing additional probe presence latent CR . The Kindt8 Schiller10 study employ two four available technique reveal presence latent CR : spontaneous recovery reinstatement . In present experiment , also examine renewal saving . These require CSs present different context , achieve following manner . Each three different tarantula appear within three different background , context , result 3 x 3 design , total nine different video clip . The use high-definition video large-screen television help reduce context-with-a-context problem . The sequence presentation nine clip pseudorandomly vary across subject within group , identical across group . 3 . SUBJECT SELECTION 3.1 . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 3.1.1 . Inclusion criterion . 1 ) Age 18-35 2 ) Top half normal human distribution Spider Phobia Questionnaire-15 . 3.2 . Exclusion criterion 3.2.1 . Exclusion criterion prior undergo first experimental session . 1 ) Any follow criterion diagnosable spider phobia : ) mark persistent fear spider excessive unreasonable ; b ) intense anxiety panic upon exposure spider ; c ) avoidance spider , anxious anticipation exposure spider , distress presence spider , interfere significantly person 's normal routine , occupational academic functioning , social activity relationship ; ) mark distress fear spider ; 2 ) Any current Axis I mental disorder Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) ; 3 ) presence drug abuse , e.g. , opiates , marijuana , cocaine , amphetamine , determine urine testing . Additionally ( 4 ) non-English-speaking subject candidate exclude validated version instrument questionnaire administer available language . 3.3 . Recruitment method . Healthy subject candidate draw advertisement medium . Most subject volunteer expect drawn pool 250,000 student Boston area . No employee student supervise Investigators enrol study , Harvard Medical School student . Candidates express interest participate schedule make visit laboratory evaluation whether satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . 4 . SUBJECT ENROLLMENT Prior initiation study procedure , investigator obtain write informed consent use form approve Partners Human Research Committee . If drug potentially involve , license physician investigator . 5 . STUDY PROCEDURES 5.1 . Design . We use SCR measure CR . We choose SCR 25 year ' experience dependent measure human conditioning studies.20 Intertrial interval vary within 15 25 sec . mean 20 sec . Two active reconsolidation-blocking intervention employ : 1 ) Propranolol reactivation Kindt,8 2 ) Reactivation-delayed extinction Schiller.10 Subjects randomize one three condition : propranolol ( 40mg ; single dose ) ; placebo ( single dose ) ; behavioral ( pill ) . The research pharmacy create manage randomization list . The study single blind . The experimental phase comprise three consecutive day fourth day one month later . Prior begin experiment , subject set level electric stimulation ( shock ) . They instruct choose level highly annoy painful . The experimenter start stimulation low , nearly imperceptible level gradually increase level subject say `` stop . '' That level use throughout experimental session . 5.1.1 Day 1 5.1.1.1 Interview Questionnaire . Candidates project undergo comprehensive evaluation ass psychiatric medical history structure clinical interview confirm lack psychiatric diagnosis ( SCID ) . Subjects also complete SPQ-15.15 Eligible candidate proceed Habituation Acquisition . 5.1.1.2 Habituation Acquisition . Subjects view video three room ( context ) , different color content , present 42 '' high definition television . The conditioned stimulus ( CSs ) three different video tarantula , one present room . Two three tarantula serve two CS+s third CS- . Each CS+ presentation sometimes follow shock ( i.e. , reinforce ) ; CS- never follow shock . Day 1 consist two sequential component : ) 2 unreinforced presentation CS ( habituation ) , follow b ) 8 presentation CS , 5 CS+ presentation follow shock ( i.e. , 63 % reinforcement , acquisition ) . All Day 1 CS presentation occur within Context A . 5.1.2 . Day 2 ( Intervention ) consist either 1 ) propranolol ( 40 mg oral ) placebo ( oral ) follow 90 min . later single , unreinforced presentation one two CS+s , designate reactivate CS+ ( CS+R ) ( Kindt8 ) ; 2 ) single , unreinforced presentation CS+R without receive pill , follow 10 min . later ) 10 unreinforced CS+R presentation ; b ) 11 unreinforced presentation remain CS+ , designate CS+ intervention ( CS+N ) ; c ) 11 CS- presentation ( Schiller10 ) . Subjects randomized one three intervention ( propranolol , placebo , behavioral ) follow Day 1 . All Day 2 CS presentation take place within Context B . 5.1.3 . Day 3 ( Renewal , Reinstatement ) consist three sequential component : ) 2 unreinforced presentation CS+R , CS+N , CS- ( renewal test trial ) ; b ) 3 presentation US alone , c ) 8 unreinforced presentation CS+R , CS+N , CS- ( reinstatement test trial , also re-extinction ) . All Day 3 CS presentation occur within Context A . 5.1.4 . Day 30 ( Spontaneous Recovery/Renewal , Savings ) consist two sequential component : ) 8 unreinforced presentation CS+R , CS+N , CS- ( spontaneous recovery test trial , also re-extinction ) ; b ) 8 presentation two CS+s 63 % reinforcement , CS- ( savings test trial re-acquisition ) . All Day 30 CS presentation occur within Context C. The following number shock deliver subject : Day 1 : 10 shock , Day 2 : 0 shock , Day 3 : 3 shock , Day 30 : 10 shock . 6 .
