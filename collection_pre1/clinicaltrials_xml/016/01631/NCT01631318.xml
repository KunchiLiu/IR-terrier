	<brief_summary>Patients invited participate research study liver perfusion ( blood flow liver time ) . Researchers hope learn whether perfusion characteristic liver metastasis may predictive response treatment whether liver perfusion characteristic use follow response treatment . Patients select possible participant study identify liver metastasis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot 3D Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging Predict Treatment Response Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The purpose study perform pilot feasibility study 3-dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasound image liver metastasis evaluate whether perfusion characteristic ( measurement blood-flow ) hepatic metastasis predict tumor response treatment patient liver metastasis . The investigator long term goal ass whether early perfusion change 2 week chemotherapy initiation use non-invasive early biomarker treatment response assessment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image initiation chemotherapy , 2 week , 2 month .</detailed_description>
