	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) continue important bacterial infection worldwide therefore new improve diagnostic test need help doctor diagnose TB . We investigate new skin test name C-Tb . Like current tuberculin skin test ( PPD ) , C-Tb test inject skin , positive , show redness and/or swell injection site negative test leave reaction . The aim trial test C-Tb skin test volunteer . The volunteer divide four group : - Negative control group : Must history exposure person tuberculosis disease . - Occasional contact : Must contact person tuberculosis disease 6 hours/week 6 hours/day - Close contact : Must close contact person tuberculosis disease 6 hours/day least five day - Positive control group : Must confirm tuberculosis disease within last 3 year . The goal clinical trial : - To compare C-Tb test blood test , QuantiFERON test . - To compare C-Tb test PPD test currently use . - To assess safety C-Tb test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Diagnostic Performance C-Tb QuantiFERON®-TB , Combination With Safety Assessment C-Tb v Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TESEC-06 trial open comparison diagnostics performance C-Tb compare QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube , combination double-blind randomized split-body safety assessment C-Tb versus Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI . The trial design address fundamental issue diagnosis latent tuberculosis ( TB ) infection , gold standard exists . Thus , exist test latent TB 100 % sensitive specific - include Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube . This addressed evaluate C-Tb positive response rate 4 group define estimate risk infection MTb . The group consist paediatric adult participant select either occasional close contact active pulmonary TB case . In addition group confirm TB case group participant history exposure MTb include control group . 50 participant negative control group test C-Tb alone order evaluate whether concomitant administration C-Tb Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI could conceivably result large small area induration one test result expand clone sensitise T-cells i.e . since Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI include among several antigen ESAT-6 CFP-10 C-Tb also contain antigen .</detailed_description>
