	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Globally 45,000 kidney transplant last year . Currently , overall survival renal transplant receptor 95 % first year 85 % 5 year . A major challenge overcome renal transplant surgeon , surgical complication may impact patient morbidity mortality , well graft function . Since 2000 date specialty Hospital Western Medical Center Mexican Institute Social Security , hospital great number kidney transplant perform , report December 2005 total 990 case , average 200 transplant annually . Since completion first kidney transplant , emerge presence complication related surgical procedure , influenced morbidity mortality transplant patient . Several factor attribute occurrence postoperative complication , patient 's nutritional status , ischemic time , presence comorbidities , organ preservation , surgical technique , experience skill surgeon postoperative care . The main cause complication kidney transplant : urological complication urinary fistula , ureteral obstruction ureteral necrosis ( le 7 % kidney transplant ) . Ischemia common probable cause urological complication secondary donor kidney extraction , anastomotic technique , variation vascular supply , rejection medication . Vascular complication early arterial thrombosis , renal vein thrombosis renal artery stenosis , almost always due technical complication , accompany twist bend blood vessel placement transplant kidney . Technical difficulty may secondary atherosclerotic disease donor receptor , interact multiple artery . Lymphatic complication lymphocele lymphatic fistula , renal transplantation accumulation lymphatic fluid postoperatively 15 % patient . It believe origin lymph destruction perivascular normal lymph duct dissection , destruction hilar lymph . Decreasing incidence surgical wound infection renal transplantation multifactorial related advance treatment anemia , uremia , general health patient end-stage renal disease . The seal partly fibrin blood product pharmacological agent . Their specific use adjunct hemostasis tissue adhesive . Seals also develop fibrin vehicle provide antimicrobial pharmacological agent , chemotherapeutic agent growth factor . They advantage product human origin without tissue toxicity , promote rapid fibrin seal . The seal normally reabsorbed day , promote local tissue growth repair without increase perioperative development adhesion . OBJECTIVE : Assess whether application fibrin seal prevents postoperative complication patient undergo kidney transplantation . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Controlled clinical trial single-blind evaluation patient surgically intervene kidney transplantation . It include patient undergoing renal transplantation Medical Center , gender 16 year 60 year . Patients exclude allergy fibrin glue component . All transplant procedure make surgical team . The receptor site preparation do address retroperitoneal region right lower quadrant abdomen incision Gibson type . The patient go distributed two group : Group 1 : fibrin , Group 2 : Control . Complication weather vascular , urological , lymphatic , infectious , hospital stay graft loss assess . The receptor site preparation do address retroperitoneal region right lower quadrant abdomen incision Gibson type . The dissection great vessel perform achieve hemostasis blood vessel node , electrocoagulation ligation gauge nonabsorbable 3-0 . The vascular anastomosis make external iliac vessel receptor shape end-side way , suture material size 6-0 , continuous suture type nonabsorbable monofilament . The new ureteral anastomosis perform modified technique Leriche-Gregoire . The new ureter tunnel anastomosed mucosa absorbable suture material 4-0 ( polyglactin ) . The biological adhesive apply study group , spray technique two atmosphere pressure total amount 10 ml . No biological adhesive , placebo simulate technique perform control group . There place continuous suction drainage close silicone type , abdominal wall close absorbable material group . Patients follow immediate postoperative period discharge , follow every week first month , every 15 day second month , monthly one year follow . During follow-up , patient assess laboratory test include complete blood count , blood chemistry serial measurement serum creatinine , glomerular filtration rate , serum electrolyte blood level immunosuppressant . Also patient follow clinical point view suspect complication , laboratory exam conduct crop , urinalysis , determination creatinine , noninvasive imaging study Doppler ultrasound , compute tomography , angiography suspect vascular complication . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Nominal variable analyze use percentage frequency , X2 test Fisher exact test . Numeric variable use Student 's test independent sample ANOVA post hoc Scheffe test . U Mann Whitney Kruskal Wallis test use long data conform normal distribution .</detailed_description>
