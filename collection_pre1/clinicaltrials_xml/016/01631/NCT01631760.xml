	<brief_summary>We hypothesize statistically significant difference miRNA profile expression subject asthma upon exacerbation compare patient 's baseline level follow effective treatment exacerbation asthma . Therefore , plasma miRNA profiling may provide noninvasive , highly specific sensitive biomarkers asthma exacerbation 's detection treatment follow-up .</brief_summary>
