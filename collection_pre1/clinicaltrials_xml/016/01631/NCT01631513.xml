Approximately 150 participant take hydrocodone , oxycodone CR , and/or morphine SR baseline pain intensity ≥4 ( ie , pain intensity score average last 4 day screen period 11-point numeric rating scale [ NRS ] ) convert initial dose tapentadol ER 100 , 150 200 mg approximately every 12 hour base total daily dose prior opioids . Enrollment participant prior opioid group ( hydrocodone , oxycodone CR , and/or morphine SR ) may stop time study ensure adequate representation prior opioid .
