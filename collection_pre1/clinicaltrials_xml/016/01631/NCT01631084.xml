	<brief_summary>In demonstration project ( Asia Pacific JADE DIAMOND Program , AP-JD short ) support Asia Diabetes Foundation ( ADF ) , patient recruit different site across Asia , site recruit least 600 type 2 diabetic patient . After explanation train doctor nurse , write informed consent , patient randomize either JADE ( n=300 , structured care ) DIAMOND ( n=300 , usual care ) group . All patient undergo comprehensive assessment ( CA ) baseline yearly thereafter . Patients JADE group manage doctor-nurse-HCA team accord protocol base risk stratification predefined follow ( FU ) schedule together share information decision support ( i.e . structure collaborative care ) . The DIAMOND protocol involve baseline yearly CA without predefined FU schedule feedback information CA visit ( i.e . usual care ) . The primary composite endpoint all-diabetes related clinical endpoint . The secondary composite endpoint attainment treatment goal and/or control risk factor . The tertiary change behavioral change , psychological well quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Effect Structured Care Versus Usual Care Type 2 Diabetes Patients Across Asia Pacific Region</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Change practice environment interdisciplinary team need implement evidence-based diabetes care require risk stratification , periodic assessment , education treatment target . Hypothesis : The use web-based disease management program ( Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation ( JADE ) Program ) deliver doctor-nurse-HCA team reduces incidence diabetes-associated clinical endpoint improve control risk factor compare usual care ( DIAbetes MONitoring Database ( DIAMOND ) group ) type 2 diabetes . Objective : To compare structure care use JADE portal versus usual care use DIAMOND portal incidence all-diabetes related event , physical psychological health . Study design : A multicentre , randomize , integrate disease management program Setting patient : 600 patient site randomize JADE group ( n=300 ) DIAMOND group ( n=300 ) follow least 24 month . Intervention : All patient undergo comprehensive assessment ( CA ) guide template respective portal baseline , month 12 24 . The JADE group manage doctor-nurse-HCA team guide JADE portal risk stratification program recommendation different care protocol predefined follow ( FU ) schedule , information share decision support . Outcome measure : Primary composite outcome include diabetes-related clinical event ; secondary composite outcome include control risk factor tertiary composite outcome include behavioral change , psychological health , quality life cost-effective analysis .</detailed_description>
