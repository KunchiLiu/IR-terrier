	<brief_summary>Ultrasonography currently common diagnostic tool image female reproductive tissue . However , clinical ultrasonography limited detection ovarian structure ≥ 2 mm , inability image microanatomy include small antral follicle oocyte . The objective study determine whether synchrotron use effectively image bovine human ovary ex situ . We hypothesize synchrotron imaging provide great resolution thereby allow detection fine structural detail ovary compare conventional ultrasonography . Ovaries image use conventional ultrasonography , synchrotron histology . We anticipate result provide important information ovarian physiology apply study female reproductive dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synchrotron Imaging Human Ovaries Ex Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective research determine whether synchrotron effective tool image human ovary ex situ . Approximately 1 every 6 woman Canada affect infertility ; however , underlie cause remain largely unknown . Imaging technique essential increase understand normal abnormal female reproductive biology . At present , ultrasonography commonly-used tool image human ovary . However , ultrasonography allow detection structure ≥ 2 mm size within ovary , limit ability detect small anatomic detail ( eg . egg surround cell 'follicles ' small fluid fill sac contain egg ) . Other limitation ultrasonography image ovary include limited depth penetration within pelvis inability see ovaries clearly due bowel activity and/or gas . The synchrotron effectively use image soft tissue , include breast , heart lung . We hypothesize synchrotron provide great resolution image ovary compare conventional ultrasonography . Specifically , anticipate synchrotron image provide great structural detail ovary ( include small follicle &lt; 2 mm egg ) compare conventional ultrasonography . The study consist three different phase list : - Phase 1 - Imaging 10 fresh preserve bovine ovary - Phase 2 - Imaging 5 preserved human ovary Department Pathology - Phase 3 - Imaging 2-4 fresh human ovary woman ovary surgically remove The initial imaging bovine ovary help u determine best synchrotron setting image human sample . All ovary preserve use formaldehyde . In 3 study phase , ovarian specimen image first 2D 3D ultrasonography Biomedical Imaging Therapy Beamline ( BMIT ) Canadian Light Source . Furthermore , histologic section structure interest within ovary make , digital image acquire . We believe synchrotron image human ovary ex situ important first step develop future high-resolution tool image reproductive tissue situ .</detailed_description>
