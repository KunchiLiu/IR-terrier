	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Maximum Tolerated Dose Dose-Limiting Toxicity drug evaluate safety antitumor activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Trial PR610 Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following informed consent , subject undergo baseline evaluation disease assessment . PR610 administer intravenously weekly . In absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity , subject may continue receive PR610 . Intra-subject dose escalation ( high high safe level ) allow subject experience dose limit toxicity . Disease assessment repeat week 6 every 8 week thereafter . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment ( PR610 PR610E ) perform subject . After determination MTD determination phase II dose , additional subject NSCLC genetically resistant reversible EGFR inhibitor accrue expansion cohort .</detailed_description>

Phase II : Stage IIIB IV , nonsquamous , nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) know sensitize mutation EGFR , T790M resistance mutation Failed , refuse , eligible standard care therapy ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Life expectancy least 12 week At least 4 week prior anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , hormonal , investigational , and/or biological therapy irradiation . Ongoing hormonal therapy administer control prostate cancer may continue study . In addition , phase II portion study , prior reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy , erlotinib gefitinib , may continue 48 hour prior start PR610 prevent significant disease flare .
