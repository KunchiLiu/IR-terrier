	<brief_summary>This study dedicate determination long term effectiveness coronary heart disease ( CHD ) treatments - cardiac shock wave therapy ( CSWT ) comparison kinds medical surgical treatment . For purpose investigator observe patient CHD enrol study routine course treatment . But investigator interfere patient treatment . Each participant followed-up five year . The collect data allow determine particular method , CSWT , could really make additional contribution traditional method CHD treatment CSWT temporarily effective could exert long term effect well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estimation Long Term Effectiveness Routine Use Cardiac Shock Wave Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design conduct accordance requirement Helsinki Declaration , 6th edition , STROBE Statement , CONSORT 2010 Statement , State Standard Russian Federation `` Guidelines Clinical Investigations Medical Devices '' ( ГОСТ Р ИСО 14155 - 2008 ) , authentic International Standards Organization standard 141555 - 2003 . According American Heart Association ( AHA ) 2011 report Russia leave behind country coronary heart disease mortality rate . This particularly mean current method CHD treatment , namely : ( 1 ) optimal medical treatment ( OMT ) , include intensive lifestyle pharmacological management , ( 2 ) maximal antianginal medical therapy ( MAAMT ) , include employment least two class anti-ischemic therapy , ( 3 ) percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCA ) , ( 4 ) coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) satisfactory enough concrete condition Russia . This indicate urgent necessity search alternative method CHD treatment . One method cardiac shock wave therapy . The method CSWT new . The first publication date back 1999 . Since score various vivo well clinical investigation conduct phase III . As result , demonstrate ( 1 ) method practically safe well-tolerated , ( 2 ) effectively alleviate angina improves ECG , ECHO , cardiac nuclear test . Meanwhile , still clear : ( 1 ) long remission last , ( 2 ) CSWT exert influence basic health indicator life span reduction major cardiovascular ( CV ) event like myocardial infarction ( MI ) , ( 3 ) place CSWT overall system conservative surgical treatment CHD , ( 4 ) long term effect combine employment CSWT invasive surgical modality . One cause state thing form CSWT research far conduct , namely , clinical trial . The high cost type investigation precludes long-term follow-up . Besides , desire make experimental control group homogeneous parallel design use multiple inclusion/exclusion criterion dramatically decrease sample representativeness . The observational design mostly free above-mentioned shortcoming instance allow obtain important result even theoretically accessible investigation strict control randomization ethical pragmatic consideration . The aim study estimate long term effectiveness routine use cardiac shock wave therapy general system noninvasive , invasive , surgical treatment ischemic heart diseases condition large general city hospital . The study conduct City Hospital No 40 , Saint Petersburg , Russia ( hospital see link bottom protocol ) . It thousand bed general hospital . There 55 thousand adult live within zone responsibility . From approximately two thousand patient CHD . The algorithm treatment selection hospital . The treatment patient begin OMT . When OMT effective MAAMT administer . The medical therapy conduct strictly individually . When MAAMT fail patient offer PCA CABG . That , general ideology CHD therapy hospital follow conventional international guideline . CSWT offer mostly two case : ( 1 ) patient refuse undergo PCA CABG , ( 2 ) PCA CABG contraindicate patient . That CSWT factually use second line , reserve method . In hospital , CSWT routinely employ three year correspondence prevail international scheme : 3 session week every first week three consecutive month , 9 session altogether accord guideline approve First deputy Saint Petersburg health care committee chairman . The CSWT implement device Cardiospec manufacture Medispec Ltd. , headquarters Germantown , MD , USA . The zone reverse myocardial ischemia CSWT application determine ECHO . For current study form seven observational cohort ( 0-VI ) diagnose intervention . The algorithm cohort formation current study graphically demonstrate Diagram ( see link bottom protocol ) . The enrollment study continue 3 year . Taking consideration current CHD morbidity rate region 6,5‰ , allows expect additional one thousand patient investigation . Each participant follow-up five year . So total length study eight year .</detailed_description>
