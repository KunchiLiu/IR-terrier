	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic esophagitis characterize eosinophilic infiltration esophagus . It present clinically variety symptom include dysphagia , emesis , food impaction . Although underlying mechanism different , gastroesophageal reflux present similar clinical finding distinguish eosinophilic esophagitis number eosinophils present esophageal biopsy . In child , food allergy play role exacerbate eosinophilic esophagitis , role food allergy adults uncertain . In study , aim determine prevalence food allergy cohort adult eosinophilic esophagitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Food Allergies Cohort Adult Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population Male female subject , age 18 year old finding &gt; 15 eosinophil per high power field endoscopic esophageal biopsy . Patients also symptoms consistent eosinophilic esophagitis include dysphagia , heartburn , epigastric pain , recurrent vomiting , food impaction . The comparative group include male female subject , age 18 year older previous diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux finding &lt; 15 eosinophil per high power field endoscopic esophageal biopsy . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Male female subject 18 year old 2 . Previous diagnosis eosinophilic esophagitis clinical symptom include heartburn , dysphagia , vomit , epigastric pain , recurrent vomiting , food impaction well &gt; 15 eosinophil per high power field ( 400x magnification ) endoscopic esophageal biopsy proximal distal esophagus 3 . Previous diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux &lt; 15 eosinophil per high power field ( 400x magnification ) endoscopic biopsy Exclusion Criteria 1 . Male female subject le 18 year age 2 . Pregnant female subject 3 . Subjects receive systemic steroid unable stop prior enrollment 4 . Subjects receive systemic antihistamine unable stop prior enrollment 5 . Subjects unable cooperate/comply study procedure communicate investigator order successfully complete study 6 . Subjects severe skin disorder atopic dermatitis , dermatographism , psoriasis would unable complete skin patch test 7 . Subjects infirmity , disability , geographical location seem likely prevent regular attendance patient visit Risks Skin test prick methodology risk systemic reaction le 0.1 % per 40 test , however , death report method testing . Systemic reaction readily treat use Injectable epinephrine oral antihistamine oral corticosteroid ( prednisone ) . Patch test know associate risk development systemic reaction . Phlebotomy associate minimal risk bleeding , significant local discomfort , infection needle puncture . Benefits Treatment option adults eosinophilic esophagitis limit . Food allergy know contributor disorder child well understand food allergy adult subject may provide additional treatment option . Adverse Events Withdrawal Criteria All subject assess adverse event study visit . If adverse event experience subject , investigator document event within subject 's file promptly report event IRB . The investigator involve study determine participant need withdrawn study base upon subject 's health medical history . Sample Size Sample size estimation base assumption 50 % adult eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) positive skin test food 10 % adult without EE positive skin test food . With assumption , total 40 subject need , 20 per group , order achieve least 80 % power two side test alpha level 0.05 beta 0.2 .</detailed_description>
