	<brief_summary>Background : Moderate-intensity exercise training improve skeletal muscle aerobic capacity increase oxidative enzyme activity , well exercise tolerance Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient . Design : To investigate home-based exercise training program reduce inflammatory biomarkers COPD . Setting : Conducted January 2007 December 2007 tertiary medical center , Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Taiwan . Patients : Moderate severe COPD receive home exercise training , 12 use mobile phone assistance 14 free walk , assess 6 month . Measurements : Incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) , spirometry , strength limb muscle , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) inflammatory cytokine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise train cornerstone comprehensive rehabilitation program patient COPD . Exercise train improves skeletal muscle oxidative capacity efficiency lead less alveolar ventilation give work rate . Patients tolerate heavy work load less dyspnea exercise . To date , remain unclear whether extent marker low-grade systemic inflammation may affect trainability clinically stable patient . Although specific exercise modality apply reverse muscle dysfunction , exercise intolerance , reduce health-related quality life , substantial heterogeneity response exercise training among patient clinically stable COPD . Endurance exercise training report consistently high clinical efficacy . Most pulmonary rehabilitation program hospital base ask patient regular supervision monitoring order achieve persistent optimal physiological benefit . However , compliance time consume regular visit hospital clinic major stumble block success program . Recently , investigator develop home-based exercise training program stable COPD patient ask walk speed control tempo music program instal mobile phone . The tempo music set keep walk speed intend level endurance exercise training patient . Our mobile phone-based system provide efficient home endurance exercise training program good compliance clinical outcome patient moderate-to-severe COPD . This study therefore design explore whether circulate level inflammatory marker , CRP , IL-6 , TNF-Î± , IL-8 , reduce patient COPD undergo mobile-phone assist home-based exercise training program</detailed_description>
