	<brief_summary>Fundacion Cantaro Azul ( FCA ) non-profit organization Baja California Sur , Mexico ( BCS ) . Since 2006 FCA pilot safe drinking-water program rural region BCS . The premise safe drinking-water program installation household drinking-water disinfection system utilize ultra-violet technology ( UV ) develop University California , Berkeley . While system test safety effectiveness inactivate waterborne pathogen , FCA interest rigorously evaluate impact safe drinking-water program population level . FCA look expand safe-water program 2009 2010 newly identify community lack safe-drinking water . In order evaluate community level effectiveness program FCA agree randomize timing expansion allow lead investigator key personal protocol conduct meaningful , scientific evaluation impact program randomize step wedge design . The research describe protocol four ( 4 ) primary objective : 1 . To evaluate impact implementation safe drinking-water program rate gastrointestinal event rural BCS community ; 2 . To evaluate impact safe drinking-water program concentration fecal contamination household drinking-water rural BCS community ; 3 . To evaluate other-health non-water impact community safe-water program implement , include school work absenteeism , health care cost ; 4 . To identify household , program system design characteristic affect user compliance disinfection strategy . The investigator hypothesize household receive UV base drinking-water disinfection system safe-water program reduce prevalence gastrointestinal illness , reduction fecal contamination household drinking-water , measure concentration Escherichia Coli per 100 ml water . Similarly , investigator hypothesize community also reduce health care cost , school work absenteeism due implementation safe drinking-water program . The investigator hypothesize household level characteristic specific program characteristic differentially impact user compliance , measure sustain use system course study . In order evaluate last hypothesis ( Objective 4 ) two program variation roll inform future programmatic decision . A priori investigator anticipate program variation impact population measure Objectives 1 2 , investigator explore assumption analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty-five thirty community ( 400-600 household ) identify Fundacion Cantaro Azul ( FCA ) community appropriate safe water program . These community identify base source water ( chemical taste characteristic ) resource availability ( access electricity lack access pip water ) . Fundacion Cantaro Azul plan expand safe-drinking water program 600 household community . In order allow meaningful evaluation impact program organization agree randomize time implementation safe drinking-water program eligible community . This allow independent researcher ( lead investigator key personal protocol ) make household visit implementation program allow valid evaluation program ' impact use step wedge study design . Through stepped-wedge study design community , 12-15 month , period approach Fundacion Cantaro Azul promotional meeting ; since community receive intervention act control time approach organization . Randomizing time community approach reduces bias allows meaningful evaluation difference outcome due safe drinking-water program . As part study design randomly assign , predetermined number rural BCS community approach every two-months enrollment safe water program Fundacion Cantaro Azul , thus 'cross-over ' comparison group safe-water group . Within crossover group half cluster receive `` Basic '' program variation , half receive `` Enhance '' program variation . This process continue consent household 25-30 community receive UV disinfection system , related support safe drinking-water program . Field team , train supervise lead investigator key personal list protocol , conduct independent ( Fundacion Cantaro Azul ) household visit collect data outcomes interest . During household visit structure interview water-quality sampling use measure outcomes ( prevalence gastrointestinal event , concentration E.coli household drinking-water , school work absenteeism compliance disinfection strategy . ) The stepped-wedge design allow evaluation impact safe drinking-water program allow relatively small organization manage logistics instal 600 household disinfection system , manner consistent mission , commitment regional governmental collaborator , fiscal restraint .</detailed_description>
