	<brief_title>Alisertib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Leiomyosarcoma Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity MLN8237 ( alisertib ) patient recurrent persistent leiomyosarcoma uterus receive one two prior cytotoxic therapy frequency patient survive progression-free least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4 ( CTCAE v4 ) among woman leiomyosarcoma treat MLN8237 . II . To determine distribution progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship Aurora A Kinase expression , measure immunohistochemistry , objective response , PFS 6 month , survival , progression-free survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
