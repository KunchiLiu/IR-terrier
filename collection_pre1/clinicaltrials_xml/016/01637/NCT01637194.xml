	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cetuximab give together everolimus treat patient metastatic recurrent colon cancer head neck cancer . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving cetuximab together everolimus may effective treatment colon cancer head neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Everolimus Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Colon Cancer Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose daily RAD001 ( everolimus ) give combination fix dose weekly cetuximab patient solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether pharmacokinetic interaction exist RAD001 CETUXIMAB patient treat regimen . II . Determine preliminary clinical evidence anti-tumor activity time progression Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion regimen . III . Determine association clinical outcome biologic marker may predict sensitivity tumor patient treat regimen . IV . Determine pharmacodynamic effect regimen post-therapy tumor and/or skin specimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -14 1-28 . Patients also receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day -7 weekly beginning day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month least 1 year .</detailed_description>
