	<brief_summary>Although several tool use evaluate severity ongoing alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) , available tool predict patient risk develop AWS time admission , patient develop AWS . Unfortunately , severe symptom alcohol withdrawal ( e.g. , seizure ) may develop early hospitalization , development systemic symptom may warn medical personnel possibility impede alcohol withdrawal ( e.g. , autonomic instability , delirium ) . The goal study evaluate psychometric property ( e.g. , predictive validity ) new tool , Prediction Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale ( PAWSS ) , identify patient risk develop complicate AWS ( i.e. , seizure , hallucinosis , delirium tremens ) among hospitalize , medically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The `` Prediction Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale '' ( PAWSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study psychometric property new tool , `` Prediction Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale '' ( PAWSS ) predict risk development complicate AWS ( i.e. , seizure , delirium tremens ) hospitalize medically ill patient . This tool develop extensive literature review identify evidence-based predictor AWS . The scale consist three portion relate 1 ) initial screening ( threshold item ) , 2 ) patient 's history alcohol use consequence , 3 ) measure BAL autonomic function . The investigator predict scale score 4 great associate high risk development complicate AWS . Patients undergo examination PAWSS within 24 hour hospital admission . Thereafter , patient undergo daily examination Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol , revise ( CIWA ) Alcohol Withdrawal Severity scale ( AWS scale ) order measure primary outcome study , , development severity ( i.e. , moderate severe ) AWS first 72-hours admission . The study design study tool 's psychometric property include validity inter-rater reliability . By provide clinician tool ( i.e. , PAWSS ) allow correctly predict develop complicate AWS enable prophylax ( i.e. , preventively treat ) patient risk thus decrease patient ' morbidity mortality , shorten length hospital stay , minimize significant burden nursing medical staff , improve overall patient care .</detailed_description>
