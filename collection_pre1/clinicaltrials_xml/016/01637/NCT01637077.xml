	<brief_title>Pregabalin Preventing Acute Pain Syndrome Patients Receiving Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pilot data regard possible effect pregabalin pain related paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome ( P-APS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pilot data regard possible effect pregabalin paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy . II . To obtain pilot data regard possible relative toxicity relate pregabalin therapy study situation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize neurological test abnormality might occur P-APS , evaluate neurological test abnormality period longer-term chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) . II . To determine PRO incidence characteristic , change , P-APS paclitaxel induce chronic CIPN several cycle . These data serve confirm result obtain previous natural history study N08C1 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pregabalin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) , begin first night chemotherapy , 12 week daily ( QD ) 1 week . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID , begin first night chemotherapy , 12 week QD 1 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 30 day 6 month .</detailed_description>
