	<brief_summary>The overarch objective study : 1 ) To investigate neurobiology posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) REM NREM sleep relative wakefulness ; 2 ) To identify neurobiological underpinnings sleep treatment response prazosin placebo wakefulness , REM sleep , NREM sleep OIF/OEF veteran PTSD ; 3 ) To explore pre-treatment brain activity pattern wakefulness , REM sleep , NREM sleep predict sleep treatment response . We also explore stability PET signal compare pre- post-placebo change brain glucose metabolism non-responders . For non-PTSD veteran , stability PET signal evaluate subsample 6 veteran without PTSD repeat PET imaging procedure 8 week initial PET series . The overarch hypothesis PTSD characterize neurobiological alteration amygdala , mPFC , brain center involve regulation NREM REM sleep , neurobiological change normalize effective sleep treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PTSD affect daytime function sleep . Complaints poor sleep , objective disruption sleep , heighten sympathovagal tone sleep occur early trauma exposure increase risk develop PTSD one year later . ( 1-4 ) . Insomnia one common reason referral mental health service active duty personnel ( 5 ) . In military personnel return Iraq Afghanistan , 70 percent PTSD report sleep problem fatigue , whereas 25 % percent without PTSD endorse symptom ( 6 ) . Other disruptive nocturnal behavior sleep disorder include sleep terror , nocturnal anxiety attack , simple complex motor behavior vocalization , act dream , sleep apnea , periodic leg movement disorder also frequently report PTSD patient ( 7-12 ) . In PTSD , sleep disturbance independently contribute poor clinical outcome increase severity daytime PTSD symptom ( 8 ) , depression ( 13 ) , suicidality ( 13 ) , general psychiatric distress ( 14 ) , poor quality life functioning ( 14 ) , poor perceive physical health ( 14 ) , increase substance use ( 15 ; 16 ) .</detailed_description>
