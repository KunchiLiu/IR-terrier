	<brief_title>Crizotinib Efficacy In Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Translocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory non-randomized study patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC . Patients eligible apply Extended Access Program crizotinib must ALK translocation detect RT-PCR , IHC FISH analyse method . Patients fail progress least one line platinum contain chemotherapy old 70 year old failure chemotherapy eligible study . We screen EML4-ALK fusion gene RT-PCR ( HotSart Taq Master Mix Kits , Qiaqen ) patient ' malignant pleural effusion detail describe previous study [ 1 ] . We also use IHC analysis ( 5A4 monoclonal antibody , Novocastra ) screen ALK protein expression patient ' FFPE tumor section . We FISH analysis use commercial Vysis LSI ALK Dual Color , Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ( 2p23 ) ( Abott Molecular Inc. , Des Plaines , IL ) detect ALK rearrangement positive screening tumor . Samples deem FISH-positive 15 % 50 scored tumor cell split ALK 5 ' 3 ' probe signal isolate 3 ' signal [ 5 ] . Patients ALK rearrangement determine 3 molecular analysis method apply crizotinib receive 250mg crizotinib twice daily disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent note . Patients monitor carefully development adverse experience . Adverse experience evaluate accord criterion outline National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . Patients also monitor clinical and/or radiographic evidence disease progression accord RECIST 1.1 . The primary endpoint study overall response rate patient positive ALK determine different molecular analysis method . The secondary endpoint include overall response specific subset patient , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) 1 year . PFS define time day 1 crizotinib disease progression patient 's death . OS define time day 1 crizotinib treatment patient 's death . During treatment , patient safety measurement perform specified time point . Disease response assess study radiographic ( e.g. , CT MRI ) , clinical ( e.g. , physical examination ) evaluation , applicable . Overall tumor response assess designated time point ( every 12 week , use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST , Version 1.1 ) . The crizotinib treatment could continue RECIST-defined disease progression clinical benefit still note primary physician .</detailed_description>
