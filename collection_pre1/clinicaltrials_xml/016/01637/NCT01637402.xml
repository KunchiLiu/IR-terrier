	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , increase dose Abiraterone Acetate combination prednisone patient prostate cancer . This study investigate whether increased-dose ( 2,000mg daily ) safe potentially effective give patient whose cancer grown take standard dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Increased-Dose Abiraterone Acetate Patients With Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II multicenter trial Abiraterone Acetate patient progressive prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation particular focus pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , pharmacogenomic event occur time apparent drug resistance . All eligible patient baseline ( prior take first dose Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg/daily ) measure routine clinical variable along measurement baseline treatment relate change testosterone , androgen , endocrine level , genotyping SNPs select enzymes know directly inhibit Abiraterone Acetate , collection circulate tumor cell . All patient request consent biopsy perform prior treatment time disease progression standard dose Abiraterone Acetate therapy . These biopsy analyze expression AR-signature well microarray analysis explore change methylation , expression CYP17A1 androgen synthesis gene . Subjects begin daily oral therapy Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg po daily physiologic prednisone 5mg BID replacement . No food consume least 2 hour dose Abiraterone Acetate least 1 hour dose Abiraterone Acetate take . PSA follow monthly . Abiraterone Acetate supply Janssen Services . At end first month , third month , every three month thereafter , Abiraterone Acetate , testosterone , androgen level follow . Subjects achieve great equal 30 % PSA decline 12 week take study . At time progression ( define RECIST criterion OR Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG ) criteria 25 % increase PSA nadir increase absolute value PSA least 2ng/dl back baseline confirm least 2 week afterward ) subject achieve initial great equal 30 % PSA decline ( referred Progressive Disease ( PD ) # 1 ) , subject begin take Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg po BID . Patients continue take prednisone 5mg BID continue therapy second progression point withdrawn study . While 1000 mg po BID FDA recommend dose , dose investigate study .</detailed_description>

Progressive disease androgen deprivation : PSA evidence progressive prostate cancer consist PSA level least 2 ng/ml rise least 2 successive occasion , least 2 week apart . If confirmatory PSA value less screen PSA value , additional test rise PSA required document progression . Antiandrogen Withdrawal Patients receive antiandrogen part primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression follow discontinuation antiandrogen . Disease progression antiandrogen withdrawal define 2 consecutive rise PSA value , obtain least 2 week apart , document osseous soft tissue progression . For patient receive flutamide , least one PSA value must obtain 4 week flutamide discontinuation . For patient receive bicalutamide nilutamide , least one PSA value must obtain 6 week antiandrogen discontinuation . No antiandrogen withdrawal response expect patient antiandrogen therapy NOT result decline PSA patient response antiandrogens &lt; 3 month . Therefore , necessary wait AAWD pt without PSA decline antiandrogen PSA response last &lt; 3 month . ECOG Performance Status 01 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week .
