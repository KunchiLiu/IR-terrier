	<brief_summary>The aim project : 1 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics first line antituberculosis drug ( isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide ethambutol ) apply 2010 WHO/IUATLD dose guideline across pediatric population ( 0-12 year age , HIV infect uninfected , vary nutritional status ) Cape Town , South Africa Blantyre , Malawi . 2 . To evaluate 8-hourly weight band-based dosing strategy lopinavir/ritonavir use commercially available lopinavir/ritonavir ( 4:1 ratio ) child South Africa receive rifampicin-based antituberculosis treatment . 3 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics nevirapine child Malawi receive rifampicin-based antituberculosis treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Dosing 1st Line Antituberculosis Antiretroviral Drugs Children ( Pharmacokinetic Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV tuberculosis major public health problem child . Challenges treat child tuberculosis include lack knowledge optimal dose first line antituberculosis drug across age , nutritional status HIV infection status , absence appropriate regimen co-administer rifampin lopinavir/ritonavir , key first line drug tuberculosis HIV , uncertainty NVP exposure young child rifampin-based tuberculosis therapy . In total , 240 child &lt; 12 year age tuberculosis enrol Red Cross Children 's Hospital Cape Town Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital , Blantyre . In second month antituberculosis treatment , one dose drug first-line regimen administer accord 2010 WHO/IUATLD guideline ( study drug ) blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis follow 8-10 hour . Children antiretroviral treatment ( start prior TB treatment ) receive 2 week antiretrovirals ( lopinavir/ritonavir nevirapine ) accord study dos ( adjust 8 hourly dos lopinavir/ritonavir , nevirapine dos accord WHO 's recommended weight band-based dos ) combination antituberculosis treatment , prior pharmacokinetic assessment antiretroviral antituberculosis drug . Children receive nevirapine also undergo pharmacokinetic evaluation 1 month completion antituberculosis treatment evaluate nevirapine concentration absence antituberculosis drug . In addition 240 child tuberculosis , 25 HIV infect South African child without tuberculosis recruit evaluate lopinavir concentration absence antituberculosis drug . A population approach use estimate optimal dos rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide ethambutol child accord covariates ( e.g . age , weight , HIV status , nutritional status ) find important influence drug concentration . Similarly population model use describe lopinavir/ritonavir nevirapine pharmacokinetics child receive rifampicin-based antituberculosis treatment , evaluate dose approach simulate alternative optimal dose approach indicate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ALL STUDY PARTICIPANTS Aged &lt; 12 year . Weighing &gt; 1.5 kg &lt; 30 kg . Written informed permission parent legal guardian child participate . Absence clear indication unwillingness refusal participate , child &gt; 7 year age , assent participate . No contraindication PK sampling ( child obviously poor venous access include ) . Able comply study visit procedure include regular adherence routine medication , adherence study medication . Enrollment defer child acute severe illness would likely jeopardize participation ( illness cause severe respiratory impairment , acute severe diarrhea , acute central nervous system impairment , severe life threaten systemic illness , severe condition require hospitalization would jeopardize participation ) . Children may enrol recovery acute illness . ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE MAIN TB COHORT AND SUBSTUDIES 1 . Main TB cohort INCLUSION A recent diagnosis TB receive intensive phase antiTB treatment 1stline drug ( rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide without ethambutol , standard dos ) . 2 . LPV SUBSTUDY CASES &amp; CONTROLS Children ART LPV/rcontaining regimen indicate , OR , Children establish LPV/rcontaining regimen . ALT &lt; 5times upper limit normal range . Children weigh 3.0 19.9 kg . Neonates must postmenstrual age least 42 week postnatal age least 14 day . CASES HIV infect child enrol main cohort least 2 week remain end intensive phase antiTB treatment PK sample schedule 2 week combine ART antiTB treatment , continuation phase antiTB treatment start . CONTROLS HIV infect child without TB . Weighted enrollment control perform number control age group &lt; 6 month , 6 month 2 year , &gt; 2 year , approximately equal number case age group . As child TB start ART TB diagnosis , recruitment control focus child recently start ART ( treatment &lt; 3 month ) . 3 . NVP SUBSTUDY HIV infect child receive intensive phase antiTB treatment enrol main study cohort Started ART include NVP ( WHO 's recommended weight bandbased dos ) 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Indication increase reduced dos 1stline antiTB drug ( e.g . mark hepatic renal impairment , TB meningitis ) .</criteria>
