	<brief_summary>- This study attempt elucidate whether stroke patient dysphagia reduce diaphragm movement voluntary coughing , also deep inspiration expiration stroke patient without dysphagia . - This study also compare various spirometric measurement diaphragmatic motion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Function Stroke Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke debilitate condition impair multiple function , include swallow . Stroke patient dysphagia , know reduced cough due multiple mechanism impair expectorate function . This lead accumulation sputum mucoid , ultimately result aspiration pneumonia . Stroke patient , especially dysphagia , also know expiratory muscle weakness weak cough healthy control . Stroke patient also know reduced diaphragm movement healthy subject . Sonography useful tool easily reliability measure diaphragm movement . Whether stroke patient dysphagia reduce diaphragm movement without dysphagia whether affect voluntary cough report yet . This study attempt evaluate diaphragm movement voluntary cough stroke patient dysphagia determine whether reduced diaphragm movement correlate peak flow meter voluntary cough .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stroke patient confirm unilateral brain lesion Gross aspiration confirm via FEES VFSS would require non oral feed group 1 . No gross evidence dysphagia would require non oral feed group 2 . No prior episode stroke dysphagia healthy control group . Episode acute pneumonia pulmonary embolism time enrollment Previous history chronic respiratory disorder systemic disorder may affect respiratory function ( ex , rheumatoid arthritis , chronic renal disease , spinal cord injury ) Stroke patient multiple brain lesion Episode Diaphragm weakness due peripheral polyneuropathy unilateral phrenic nerve palsy Previous episode abdominal thoracic surgery within one year enrollment Concomitant diagnosis myopathy , muscular dystrophy disorder may affect respiratory muscle . Episode rib fracture within one year enrollment Chronic alcoholism Patient previous diagnosis dementia impair cognitive function may limit full participation evaluation .</criteria>
