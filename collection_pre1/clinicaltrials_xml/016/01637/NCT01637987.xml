	<brief_title>Nurse PIV Insertion Success With Without Assistive Devices Patients 0-12 Months Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining peripheral intravenous ( PIV ) access nearly universal procedure medical management hospitalize pediatric patient . In child , PIV placement often difficult due inability identify peripheral vein ( Wilson , 2007 ) . Many assistive device use promote improve vein visualization intention increase PIV insertion success . Limited research find support assumption regard nursing PIV insertion success child . This study randomize , control trial determine use vein identification assistive device increase nurse PIV insertion success within first two attempt child 0-12 month age compare unassisted method . Patients admit Children 's Hospital &amp; Medical Center ( CHMC ) Emergency Department , 4th floor medical-surgical unit , 5th floor medical-surgical/ Intermediate Care Unit , 12 month age require non-emergent PIV placement part medical plan care eligible . Following consent subject randomize one three vein identification method study group ( 1 ) Wee Sight Transilluminator - hand hold light emit device hold adjacent patient 's extremity visualize venous anatomy ; ( 2 ) VeinViewer - us near infrared light view hemoglobin project image venous anatomy onto skin ; ( 3 ) Unassisted Methods - traditional technique vein visualization palpation . Based study group assignment nurse use appropriate vein identification method first two PIV insertion attempt . Evaluation vein identification method base PIV insertion success failure .</detailed_description>
