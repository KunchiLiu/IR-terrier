	<detailed_description>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma rare form lymphoma skin . While early stage usually confine skin , later stage may spread blood , lymph node organ . At point , patient usually require systemic chemotherapy . This study investigate effect everolimus treatment patient diagnose CTCL either respond previous treatment recur despite previous treatment . Everolimus common name commercial drug Afinitor® ( Novartis ) . It approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use kidney brain cancer . In several different form lymphomas , everolimus use investigational drug , mean approved FDA group diseases . Everolimus block protein ( mTOR ) help cell tumor grow . Earlier study indicate drug everolimus may work lymphomas include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Participation study last long study doctor believe disease gotten bad , patient continue tolerate study medication maximum 1 year . Once treatment , patient follow two year .</detailed_description>
