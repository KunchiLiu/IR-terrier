	<brief_summary>A clinical randomized control trial , compare 2 endovenous laser ablation ( EVLA ) techniques patient insufficiency great saphenous vein ( GSV ) . There multiple EVLA device available , different wavelength . In Netherlands , 940 nm Diode 1470 nm Nd : Yag laser frequently use device . Both device also prove equally effective occlude GSV . However , little known difference patient-related outcome . Therefore , primary outcome comparative clinical trial 940 nm 1470 nm EVLA , pain score , patient satisfaction score health relate varicose-specific questionnaire . The secondary outcome complication effectiveness treatment . It think possibly 1470 nm ELVA give low pain score higher patient satisfaction 940 nm EVLA . No difference expect complication rate effectiveness two treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Endovenous 940 1470 Laser Ablation Treating Great Saphenous Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>* Study type : Interventional . Randomized comparative clinical trial.. - Outcome measure : - Primary study outcome : Patient report outcome : 1 . Pain score use painkiller , assess numeric rating scale ( NRS ) pain . 2 . Treatment satisfaction , assess NRS satisfaction . 3 . Health related quality life , assess Dutch translate Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire ( AVVQ ) EQ-5D questionnaire . - Secondary study outcome : 1 . Number patient adverse event . Major complication : deep superficial venous thrombosis ( embolic event ) , nerve injury , skin burn , ( sub ) cutaneous infection . Minor complication : ecchymosis hyperpigmentation . 2 . Obliteration varicose vein and/or absence reflux ( &gt; 0.5 sec . retrograde flow ) along treat segment GSV . This measure use US examination . - Outcome measure time frame : Follow-up one year , outcome measure baseline , 1 week , 3 month 1 year post treatment . * Focus study : Varicose great saphenous vein ( GSV ) - Intervention information : - Intervention name : endovenous laser ablation ( EVLA ) - Intervention type : 1 . EVLA 940 nm Diode laser 2 . EVLA 1470 nm Nd : Yag laser - Arm information : intervention active comparators . - Locations : Rotterdam , Zuid-Holland , The Netherlands</detailed_description>
