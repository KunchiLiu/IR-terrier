	<detailed_description>Kidney stone affect 10 % Canadian population lead pain , hospitalization , lose time work , surgery . Approximately 80 % stone consist calcium oxalate , component come diet normal bodily process . Individuals high level oxalate urine great tendency generate stone . One recommendation reduce intake oxalate-containing food , many healthy food contain oxalate , oxalate-free diet unpalatable difficult achieve . Some patient , despite reduce oxalate intake , still high amount urine . Intestinal metabolism largely affected state composition intestinal bacterial flora , several metabolic disease link disrupt `` normal '' intestinal flora . The investigator believe calcium oxalate stone disease well high urinary level oxalate ( hyperoxaluria ) trigger inefficient oxalate metabolism intestine , link `` disrupt '' intestinal bacterial flora lack certain key component O. formigenes . The long-term purpose study therefore , determine effect replenish intestinal flora patient `` normal '' control , thereby re-introduce balance environment lead re-establishment normal metabolic function decrease urinary oxalate level hopefully low incidence stone disease .</detailed_description>
