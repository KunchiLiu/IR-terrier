	<brief_summary>Metastatic malignant tumor comprise vast majority spinal tumor adult . The devastate complication spinal metastatic disease ( SMD ) invasion spinal canal compression spinal cord nerve root cauda equina , result clinical entity know cord compression manifest progressive loss motor function sensation leg , well bladder bowel incontinence . The treatment spinal metastasis mostly palliative goal improve maintain neurologic function , achieve local tumor control , spinal stability . Most patient spinal metastatic disease currently treat effectively radiation therapy and/or surgery good result . There however certain limitation current treatment SMD . Radiation therapy two important limitation : 1 ) target SMD close proximity spinal cord , delivery high radiation dos contraindicate may cause radiation-induced damage spinal cord ( myelopathy , 2 ) limit cumulative amount radiation dose , mean recurrent tumor may amenable repeat radiation therapy . As far spinal surgery concern , main limitation patient fit surgery medical co-morbidities . This phase I clinical research trial test hypothesis new minimally invasive treatment call spinal intra-arterial chemotherapy ( SIAC ) safely applied patient SMD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date , effective systemic therapy spinal metastasis , goal treatment achieve local control tumor . Despite advance radiation therapy , still subgroup patient effectively treat radiation close proximity tumor spinal cord . In addition , case recurrent tumor , patient re-treated reach maximum allow radiation dose . Surgery alternative treatment patient , tumor recur surgery patient comorbidities make surgery high-risk procedure . Based prior experience selective IA chemotherapy treatment ocular retinoblastoma high local control rate achieve selective IA injection chemotherapy recurrent limb melanoma ( limb infusion limb perfusion ) expect spinal intra-arterial chemotherapy selective injection Melphalan arteries feed metastatic disease feasible safe may prove beneficial achieve local control spinal tumor , prevent neurological compromise cord compression . This minimally invasive approach use patient radiation therapy surgery contra-indicated essentially treatment option .</detailed_description>
