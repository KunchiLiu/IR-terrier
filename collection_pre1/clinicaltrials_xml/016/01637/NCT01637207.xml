	<brief_title>How Easy Identify Cricothyroid Membrane Children ? Can Ultrasound Imagine Used Aid Identification ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cricothyroidotomy infrequent potentially life-saving procedure . The need cricothyroidotomy arises ca n't intubate ca n't ventilate ( CICV ) scenario therefore incorporate difficult airway guideline adult child . This CICV scenario less common paediatric population adult population difficult airway manage with-bag mask ventilation PEEP . The cricothyroid membrane useful place access airway case glottic supraglottic obstruction relatively avascular , superficial 'full ring ' cricoid protects posterior perforation . In adult , average cricothyroid membrane CTM 13.7mm long 12.4mm wide . The CTM relatively short child . In neonate CTM mean height 2.6mm width 3mm . In child prominent anterior midline structure neck thyroid adult hyoid bone cricoid cartilage . As larynx cephalad child cricothyroid membrane high adult placement catheter may difficult mandible get way . A healthy amount adipose subcutaneous tissue obscure anatomy . Currently clinicians identify CTM use palpation anatomical landmark . In infant , head extension soft tissue pull towards mandible , CTM may difficult distinguish . It suggest bimanual manipulation may enable identification cartilaginous trachea . To perform cricothyroid puncture , syringe contain sterile saline attach cannula . The skin cricothyroid membrane stabilise index finger thumb non-dominant hand . The transtracheal cannula insert cricothyroid membrane 45ยบ angle head caudal posterior . However , neonate due restrict dimension , needle option cricothyroidotomy . Even experience hand , cricothyroidotomy technically challenge . In inexperienced hand lead significant injury include risk fracture thyroid cricoid cartilage . A recent abstract try determine whether easy locate CTM child . Their initial conclusion suggest identification CTM difficult . The limitation study small number one person ask perform identification . The application ultrasound vast varied . It readily available , portable easy use . Of note , recent study use ultrasound ( Sonosite 10Hz ) help identify CTM adult . Following period training , find improve accuracy speed identification . The investigator aim determine easy anaesthetist identify CTM child infants whether ultrasound maybe useful adjunct . The investigator aim conduct randomize single blind trial compare method detect CTM : palpation anatomical landmark versus ultrasound .</detailed_description>
