	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate outcome establish procedure treatment kidney stone present within inner aspect kidney . This procedure call flexible ureteroscopy , involve place small camera urethra anesthetize ( asleep ) , ureter ( tube connect kidney bladder ) kidney kidney stone . Then , stone broken tiny fragment use small laser call Holmium laser . While treatment well-established option treatment stone , several different technique use help eliminate kidney . Some urologists treat stone method call `` active '' extraction whereby ureteroscope pass back forth kidney remove visible stone fragment . Others use method call `` dusting '' whereby stone break tiny fragment `` dust '' intention achieve small stone size allow stone pas spontaneously . There systematic rigorous comparison technique term treatment outcome . By collect information success treatment , investigator hope provide benchmark data future study kidney stone treatment improve care patient need surgery kidney stone . The investigator hypothesize stone free rate renal stone ( ) 5-15 mm around 90 % stone clearance rate 20 % high patient undergo complete stone fragment extraction versus undergo stone dusting ( residual fragment &lt; 2mm ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Dusting '' Versus `` Basketing '' - Treatment Of Intrarenal Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , inadequate literature confidently determine ideal technique stone extraction ureteroscopy , endourologic procedure treatment kidney stone . The goal ureteroscopy intrarenal stone fragment stone minimize residual fragment safe expeditious way minimal harm patient . Options treatment intrarenal stone consist use basket pull laser break small fragment . When stone deem large basketed primarily , standard preference ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy use Holmium : YAG laser effectively break stone fragment small enough remove pas spontaneously . There consensus achieve optimal stone clearance primary stone fragment lithotripsy . Many urologist choose &amp; quot ; dust &amp; quot ; stone breaking tiny fragment &amp; lt ; 1 - 2 mm size assumption stone fragment small size pas spontaneously surgery . This theoretically decrease operative time low risk ureteral trauma minimize repetitive introduction removal ureteroscope . Others choose actively extract possible stone fragment procedure thereby increase immediate stone-free outcome . Active extraction however typically increase cost require use basket grasper ureteral access sheath . To date , one prospective , randomize study address practice active extraction v spontaneous passage , result suggest high rate residual stone fragment , hospital readmission need ancillary procedure stone actively extract ( 8 ) . This study criticize follow standardized operative protocol report several important outcome include stone composition . Additionally , study use semirigid ureteroscopy , specifically address ureteral rather intrarenal stone , follow `` dust '' protocol assure minimal size residual fragment . Complete eradication stone fragment one primary outcome ureteroscopy residual renal stone fragment ureteroscopy show lead subsequent stone event approximately 20 % case ( 9 ) . However , maximize eradication stone fragment must come expense patient . For reason important consider operative variable associate different technique employ clear stone procedure . For example , average nearly three time much laser energy use fragment stone tiny piece compare active extraction ( 8 ) . Conversely , active extraction stone fragment require introduce remove ureteroscope ureter great number time order facilitate stone removal ; generally require use ureteral access sheath , treatment associate risk. ( 10 ) . The short term long term difference result use technique currently unknown .</detailed_description>
