	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate use advance quantitative mass spectometry ( Super SILAC ) discovery platform uncover novel protein biomarkers tumor compare protein profile different subtypes breast cancer ( ER positive , HER2 positive , triple negative ) . A maximum 100 breast tumor specimen obtain NUHS Tissue repository , comprise approximately equal proportion ER positive , HER2 positive , triple negative tumor . Samples analyze use advanced Mass Spectrometry ( Super SILAC ) discovery platform identify novel protein biomarkers may important cancer . DNA RNA also extract tumor sample correlative analysis proteomics data . Genomics proteomics data correlate clinical data include treatment response survival data . Importance propose research science medicine : Identification tumor biomarkers may allow good prognostication , follow-up , selection treatment cancer patient future . Potential benefit risk : No direct benefit patient . Risk subject minimal direct patient contact , analysis do previously donate tumor sample . Patients previously provide consent donate sample research NUHS Tissue Repository . Novel tumor biomarkers determine tumor biology , include prognosis treatment sensitivity , may detectable use novel advanced quantitative mass spectromy method ( Super SILAC ) . Different subtypes breast cancer different proteomic profile analyze use super SILAC .</brief_summary>
