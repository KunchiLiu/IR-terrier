	<brief_summary>Onset psychotic disorder schizophrenia , typically occur late adolescence early adulthood often result chronic social occupational disability . Deficits cognition functional outcome often precede onset full-blown psychosis although less degree observe schizophrenia . Recent progress risk identification methodology enable reliable detection person appear putatively prodromal psychosis , , clinical high risk ( CHR ) develop psychotic disorder . Since CHR individual already evidence cognitive deficit , increase around time conversion , cognition excellent treatment target . Furthermore , clear evidence , schizophrenia CHR sample , deficit cognition relate poor functional outcome . Thus , treatment target cognition may consequently improve functional outcome . The primary aim project reduce cognitive deterioration improve cognition among youth CHR use cognitive remediation test effectiveness new cognitive remediation program , Brain Fitness program , improve cognition CHR individual . A control treatment consist video game ( VG ) use . The primary hypothesis BF group improve cognition end treatment 12 month post baseline compare VG group . A secondary hypothesis improve cognition associate improved functioning . This longitudinal , single blind , placebo control pilot trial cognitive remediation 36 CHR person . Participants randomise either BF VG program , administer period 3 month . Assessments occur baseline , post treatment ( 3 month ) 12 month baseline . All subject recruit year 1 project treatment complete 15 month . The 40 hour train occur 4 day week , hour day , period 10 -12 week .</brief_summary>
