	<brief_title>Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Transplant Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure adult-to-adult live donor liver transplant ( LDLT ) extraordinary surgical therapy involve removal 70 % volume mass adult donor liver implantation adult recipient . A critical shortage decease donor liver , result premature mortality among candidate need liver transplantation , remain single compelling force drive need adult-to-adult LDLT . Patients await live donor liver transplant ask enroll protocol time identification potential living liver donor . Donors identify live donation also ask enroll protocol . Donors recipient already participate liver donation/transplant approach join protocol base clinical history . Optimizing donor ' health-related quality life foremost goal liver donor liver transplant program overarch aim study . The propose A2ALL-2 Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) Sub-Study build upon A2ALL HRQOL measure employ date . There critical need look important difficulty liver donor appear face early year long-term donation . Individuals enrol study go donate portion liver complete HRQOL battery test conduct phone experienced staff Northwestern University University Pittsburgh . The test series question give upcoming donor baseline ( prior liver donation ) , Month 3 , Month 6 , Year 1 Year 2 follow donation . The new donor complete 5 interview survey research team . Individuals already donate ( long-term donor ) , three year since donation enrol , donated 2002 recently . Long-term follow-up donor complete 4 interview survey research team . As LDLT move child adult , observe early size graft relate function recipient inadequate graft volume lead poor recipient outcome . It find , graft liver small , recipient develop number symptom include persistent ascites ( fluid abdomen ) graft become resistant passage blood . This study hop develop validate approach permit successful use small donor liver principal goal surgical innovation portion study . The study use standard surgical technique donor recipient . Either right left lobe donation transplantation perform base clinical parameter graft selection . Biosample collection serum aliquot liver tissue sample collect subject different timepoints study . The collection patient biosamples DNA sample provide resource researcher rapidly validate clinical hypothesis algorithms clinical decision making . The collection also advance development diagnostic prognostic marker therapeutic . In addition , collection storage DNA sample may increase sample size result power study identify genetic determinant disease . The sample store National Institute Diabetic , Digestive Kidney disease ( NIDDK ) Repositories . Hepatic C virus ( HCV ) recurrence liver transplantation universal patient virus pre-operatively . Chronic hepatitis evolve cirrhosis variable rate , rapidly non-transplant patient . The study evaluate whether risk factor aggressive HCV recurrence DDLT also apply LDLT recipient long-term follow-up . Pain control live donor follow partial hepatectomy measure quality care . The transplant community objective information pain management live liver donor use quality improvement . A validated tool measure quality pain management use assess multidimensional aspect pain care . The follow detail schedule visit tests/procedures perform visit : Recipient ( surgery ) - Provide blood sample NIDDK Biosample Repository . - Undergo image study either Computed Assisted Tomography ( CAT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) measure size liver spleen . - If one liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , information collect tumor ( ) treatment . Recipient ( day surgery ) - Provide sample new liver NIDDK Biosample Repository . - Provide blood sample immediately transplant surgery NIDDK Biosample Repository . - Allow researcher collect information transplant surgery . - Allow researcher collect information complication develop transplant . - During transplant operation , ultrasound probe apply two vessel go transplant liver measurement much blood flow vessel liver take . After less 5 minute probe remove . Additionally , measurement take pressure one vessel , portal vein , small needle insert surgeon . These measurement record analyzed part study . - During live donor transplant surgery , occasionally necessary adjust blood flow liver improve function . If surgeon determines flow liver needs adjust , measurement describe repeated adjustment make . These measurement record analyzed part study . - Additional test standard care may also carry site . - If one HCC , information collect tumor ( ) . Recipient ( immediately surgery ) - Provide blood sample first second week transplant NIDDK Biosample Repository . - Allow researcher collect information lab test ( liver function test , blood count , etc. ) . - Undergo ultrasound measurement blood flow portal vein day operation . - Additional test standard care may also carry site . Recipient ( throughout course study ) - Provide blood sample NIDDK Biosample Repository month 1 , 3 , 12 , annually thereafter though August 2014 . Approximately 10 teaspoon 50 cc blood collect assessment . - Undergo image study three month operation ( either CAT MRI ) liver spleen see much liver grow since transplant operation . - Return transplant center assessment month 1,3 , 12 , annually thereafter August 2014 . - Allow researcher collect information hospitalization occur transplant operation . - Allow researcher collect information complication develop transplant , August 2014 . - Allow researcher collect information liver biopsy perform transplant . - If subject Hepatitis C ( HCV ) post-transplant , liver transplant live donor decease donor , subject ask permission review chart collect information pre-transplant HCV treatment , transplant operation , immunosuppression medication , rejection episode , HCV treatment receive prior consent study . - If subject HCV , give permission , chart review liver biopsy result occur least three year transplant . - If liver biopsy do least three year transplant recent liver biopsy least three year transplant recent liver biopsy one year subject ask come center get liver biopsy do . - If study liver biopsy do , information previous biopsy collect slide liver tissue obtain sent central pathologist read . The name subject identify information slide . It code number link back subject 's clinical data . - If HCV subject unwilling unable undergo liver biopsy , subject ask undergo procedure call `` transient elastography '' . Transient elastography non-invasive procedure sound wave transmit liver ultrasound probe , time take sound wave travel liver measure . Transient elastography consider experimental procedure . However , well-studied , adverse event injury use . - If subject HCV , blood collect storage NIDDK Repository . Approximately 10 teaspoon 50ccs blood collect time . Donor ( surgery ) - The subject call telephone survey researcher answer question health , well-being well view donation process . - The survey question may take 45 minute complete . - Provide blood cell sample NIDDK Biosample Repository . Approximately 12 teaspoon 60 cc blood collect . - Undergo image study operation ( either CAT MRI ) measure size liver spleen . - Additional test standard care may also carry site . Donor ( day surgery ) - Provide sample liver NIDDK Biosample Repository . - Allow researcher collect information donation surgery . - Allow researcher collect information complication develop donation . Donor ( immediately surgery ) - Two day surgery , subject ask question post-operative pain . - Provide blood sample one week donation surgery NIDDK Biosample Repository . Approximately 5-6 teaspoon 25-30ccs blood collect . Donor ( throughout course study ) - Provide blood sample NIDDK Biosample Repository week 1 , month 1 , month 3 , month 12 . Approximately 10 teaspoon 50 cc blood collect assessment . - Return transplant center assessment month 3 , annually thereafter August 2014 . - Undergo imaging study three month operation ( CAT MRI ) measure size liver spleen see much liver grow back since donation operation . - If subject enter study prior undergoing surgery , question answer telephone quality life donation 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month follow donation . These telephone interview may take 45 minute complete . - If subject enter study live liver donation , question ask telephone quality life upon study entry annually three year . The telephone interview may take 45 minute complete . - Allow researcher collect information complication develop donation operation , August 2014 . - Allow researcher collect information hospitalization occur transplant operation .</detailed_description>
