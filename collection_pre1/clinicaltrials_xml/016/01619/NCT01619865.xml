	<detailed_description>This protocol design test efficacy 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT diagnosis , stag , measurement response treatment patient somatostatin receptor positive tumor . We 1 ) compare unique PET/CT scan current standard care combination Octreoscan SPECT ( single photon emission tomography ) plus high resolution , contrast enhance CT ; 2 ) Determine sensitivity 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT diagnosis patient suspect somatostatin receptor positive tumor ; 3 ) For patient recent treatment ( e.g. , surgery , chemotherapy , target therapy anti-angiogenics , kinase inhibitor , peptide receptor radiotherapy ) , measure response treatment . These study obtain long term goal submit New Drug Application ( NDA ) FDA approval 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT adult child . Project Design 68Ga-DOTATOC Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Diagnosis , Staging , Measurement Response Treatment Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumors prospective , Phase 1-2 , single center , open-label study subject know suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumor . Eligible participant undergo baseline assessment enrollment . Study participant receive 68Ga-DOTATOC undergo PET/CT imaging study option receive second 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT begin new treatment ( surgery , hepatic embolization , Sandostatin LAR , chemotherapy , target biological therapy , peptide receptor radiotherapy ) within 30 day first scan . The second scan perform time recommend treat physician optimal interval observe result treatment . Project Goal This study plan demonstrate safety efficacy [ 68Ga ] -DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ( [ 68Ga ] -DOTATOC ) accurate image technique diagnosis , stag , monitor response treatment patient Somatostatin receptor express tumor . Neuroendocrine tumor solid malignant tumor arise disperse neuroendocrine cell find throughout body . Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) divide two group : Carcinoid tumor may arise lung , stomach , small bowel colon pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( also know pancreatic islet cell tumor ) . The clinical behavior NETs extremely variable ; may cause hormone hypersecretion others may , majority slow-growing tumor ( well-differentiated NETs ) , whereas NETs highly aggressive ( poorly differentiate NETs ) . The incidence NETs increase , 1.1/100,000 per year 1973 5.3/100,000 per year 20041 . Among NETs , 25 % distant metastases 25 % regional involvement time initial diagnosis [ 1 ] . Other tumor express high level somatostatin receptor include neuroblastoma , medulloblastoma , Ewing 's sarcoma [ 2-4 ] . The radiological detection stag tumor challenge require multimodality approach . Somatostatin receptor image In-111 Pentetreotide ( OctreoScan ) multiphase CT commonly use modality although use endoscopic ultrasound MRI also increase . Surgery curative option NETs . However , curative surgery malignant NET possible less 30 % patient recurrence identify majority patient late 15 year initial surgery . Treatment somatostatin analog , include short act subcutaneous long act release ( LAR ) octreotide , effective stabilize NETs recently demonstrate prolong time progression disease [ 5 ] . Chemotherapy generally effective low grade NETs , may helpful high grade pancreatic NETs . On hand , neuroblastoma , medulloblastoma , Ewing 's sarcoma initially responsive chemotherapy , relapse common salvage therapy effective , result &lt; 30 % overall survival 5 year [ 6-8 ] . Somatostatin Receptor Targeted Imaging Therapy Tumors express somatostatin receptor target radiolabeled somatostatin analogue image treatment . Somatostatin receptor gamma camera image In-111 DTPA-octreotide ( OctreoScan ) target somatostatin receptor 2 ( sstr2 ) , use routinely image neuroendocrine tumor detection rate &gt; 90 % well-differentiated carcinoid tumor majority pancreatic NETs , 50 % detection rate insulinomas , may show weak expression sstr2 [ 9 ] . Given clinical efficacy radiolabeled peptide diagnostic agent , study test therapeutic radiation could target tumor similar manner logical next step . Attempts utilize In-111 DTPA Octreotide therapeutic agent minimally effective due short range auger electron utilized therapy . The efficacy treatment improve development somatostatin analogue label beta emit radioisotope . Further study identify DOTA superior chelator compare DTPA , increase stability receptor target somatostatin analogue [ 10 ] . There large clinical experience Yttrium-90 DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide peptide radioreceptor therapy ( PRRT ) Europe , primarily adult neuroendocrine tumor [ 11 ] . An international Phase II clinical trial follow included several trial site United States , notably University Iowa , enter 40 subject [ 12 ] . With low toxicity profile , significant improvement symptom quality life lack effective alternative therapy , PRRT suggest possible first-line therapy adult patient gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . Recent data also demonstrate significant survival benefit PRRT compare historical control population . We also conduct Phase I trial 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide child young adult University Iowa , also show promise efficacy treatment pediatric patient population [ 13 ] . We propose new image agent use diagnosis therapy Somatostatin receptor positive tumor . Somatostatin Receptor PET Imaging Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotide More recently , positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiopharmaceutical develop label Gallium-68 ( Ga-68 ) . Gallium-68 generator product half-life 68 min ( compare 67 hour In-111 OctreoScan ) . The parent nuclide Ga-68 Germanium-68 , half-life 270.8 day . Ga-68 decay 89 % positron emission 11 % electron capture . Its parent , A number Ga-68 DOTA-conjugated peptide introduce , include Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3 ] octreotide ( Ga-68 DOTATOC ) , Ga-68 DOTA0-1NaI3-octreotide ( Ga-68 DOTANOC ) [ Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3 ] octreotate ( Ga-68 DOTATOC ) . All radiolabeled peptide bind sstr2 , although DOTANOC also bind sstr 3 sstr 5 , DOTATOC sstr5 [ 14 ] . The primary advantage Ga-68 base somatostatin receptor PET image OctreoScan SPECT high image resolution accurate quantitation uptake due robust attenuation correction . The improved resolution quantitation uptake obtain Ga-68 DOTATOC PET provide accurate assessment somatostatin receptor density , lead accurate prediction treatment response somatostatin analogue . A recent study Europe compare Ga-68 DOTATOC Octreoscan find Ga-68 DOTATOC superior detection skeletal pulmonary involvement neuroendocrine tumor [ 15 ] . Rationale overall study design Rationale:68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan 90Y-DOTATOC peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT ) readily available Europe , neither radiopharmaceutical approve use United States . IND # 61,907 currently active name investigator 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT somatostatin receptor positive tumor . We conduct single institution Phase I trial 90Y-DOTATOC therapy child young adult ( Appendix I ) participate Phase II trial 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT adult ( also Appendix II ) . The purpose amendment IND application test efficacy 68Gallium-DOTATOC diagnosis , stag , determination response 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT child adult know suspect somatostatin receptor positive tumor , include , limited neuroendocrine tumor , neuroblastoma , medulloblastoma . 68Ga-DOTATOC PET would replace 111In-DTPA-Octreotide single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) imaging . Whereas , Octreoscan use 222 MBq image dose Indium ( 2.8 day half life ) result effective dose equivalent ( HE ) equal 2.61 rad , [ 68Ga ] DOTATOC ( 68 min half life ) use 185 MBq effective dose equivalent 0.46 rad . In addition , [ 68Ga ] DOTATOC PET/CT complete within 2 hour compare Octreoscan require 3 visit 24 hour , make [ 68Ga ] DOTATOC much convenient image choice patient . The data obtain Ga-68 DOTATOC PET study use support use 68Ga-DOTATOC PET diagnosis stag patient suspect proven somatostatin receptor positive tumor .</detailed_description>
