	<criteria>Patients must histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available translational study . Presence clinically and/or radiologically document disease ( measurable nonmeasurable ) . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . Patients elevate PSA eligible . Androgen ablation must include either medical surgical castration . If patient receive medical androgen ablation , castrate level testosterone ( &lt; 1.7 nmol/L ) must present . Patients must metastatic locally recurrent disease , curative therapy exist systemic therapy indicate due progression follow castration . Progression define one following : PSA Progression : A rise PSA , receive androgen ablative therapy , 2 subsequent rise reference value ( necessarily consecutively ) , measure minimum one week apart . The PSA confirm progression must value ≥2 ng/ml must perform longer 7 day prior trial randomization . Patients prolonged response combine androgen blockade evaluate withdrawal response prior confirm eligibility OR Radiological Progression : define development new metastatic lesion progression target disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) stable rise PSA . The PSA must ≥ 5 ng/ml time study entry . ECOG performance 0 , 1 2 . Age ≥ 18 year age . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Previous Therapy Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 14 day prior patient randomization wound heal occur . Chemotherapy : Patients may NOT receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy recurrent/metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . Prior docetaxel treatment permit unless provide adjuvant therapy protocol 12 month prior study enrollment . Hormonal Therapy : Prior hormone therapy require . Patients must castrate resistant discontinue antiandrogens least 4 week prior study entry ( least 6 week bicalutamide ) . Therapy LHRH agonist must continue prostate cancer patient already receive treatment time enrollment . If patient discontinue LHRH agonist , must restart ( surgically castrate ) castrate level testosterone must present . Prior therapy CYP17 inhibitor ( e.g . abiraterone , ketoconazole ) novel antiandrogens ( e.g . MDV3100 ) permit . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Prior strontium permit . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) ALT AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN Proteinuria &lt; 2g/24hrs ( screen use spot testing ; ≥ grade 2 repeat midstream urine still ≥ grade 2 urine collection 24 hour confirm &lt; 2g/24hrs ) Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . ( Please call NCIC CTG question interpretation criterion ) . Patients immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. Patients active uncontrolled infection , serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients eligible know hypersensitivity study drug ( ) component . Patients history central nervous system metastasis untreated spinal cord compression . Patients prior treatment docetaxel advanced/metastatic disease . Men sterile unless use adequate method birth control .</criteria>
