	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary objective : • The investigator aim conduct questionnaire survey South-East Asian tertiary institution , ass whether breast cancer patient physician would consider use three different kind genetic test currently available breast cancer patient : - BRCA1/2 germline testing , - CYP2D6 genotyping - Oncotype DX® testing . Secondary objective : To explore factor might influence decision genetic testing , include : 1 . Acceptability test anti-cancer management base test result 2 . Reliability affordability test 3 . Ability test influence treatment decision 4 . Broader implication test , e.g. , psychosocial , financial impact Study design : Cross-sectional study , Survey Questionnaires develop 3 category individual : - Patients early stage breast cancer - Healthcare professional care breast cancer patient - Medical student /cancer researcher The questionnaire patient medical students/cancer researcher similar . The questionnaire contain brief section demographic information , interest past experience genetic testing . Three hypothetical situation describe determine participant agree BRCA1/2 testing , CYP2D6 genotyping Oncotype DX® testing , respectively . 18 categorical 'yes'/ 'no ' question explore reason decision . Each scenario require short , hand-written response . The questionnaire healthcare professional contain brief section demographic past experience genetic testing . Three hypothetical situation describe determine healthcare professional recommend patient BRCA1/2 test , CYP2D6 genotyping Oncotype DX® testing , respectively . 12 categorical question explore reason decision , physician require rank order importance . Distribution questionnaire : Questionnaires hand agreeable participant follow occasion : 1 . Patients- National University Health System Cancer Centre Level 3 amp ; 4 wait area 2 . Medical student - lecture , personal contact 3 . Cancer researcher - lecture , personal contact 4 . Healthcare professionals - NUHS breast tumour board , personal contact Due caution exercise ensure questionnaire hand subject age 21 year . No subject identity collect questionnaire . Rationale Hypothesis : BRCA1/2 germline testing , CYP2D6 genotyping Oncotype DX® test approve use clinical practice , controversy still exist surround utility , apart BRCA1/2 mutation test high-risk individual , genetic test routinely perform Singapore . BRCA1/2 germline mutation test perform individual high risk hereditary cancer . CYP2D6 genotype test predicts benefit adjuvant tamoxifen therapy ; poor intermediate metabolisers tamoxifen may high risk breast cancer recurrence due low efficacy tamoxifen less efficient conversion tamoxifen endoxifen , active metabolite tamoxifen . Oncotype DX® test gene-expression profile test perform formalin-fixed paraffin embed tumour specimen , predict risk breast cancer recurrence guide decision adjuvant chemotherapy . Understanding attitude patient medical professional toward genetic test may help guide medical oncologist clinical recommendation utilization test breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>
