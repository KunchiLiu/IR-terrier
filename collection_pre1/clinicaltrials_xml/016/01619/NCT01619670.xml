	<brief_summary>Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) rare disease , severe impact life patient caregiver . Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) comprise group genetically determine skin fragility disorder characterize blister skin mucosa follow mild mechanical trauma . There specific proven treatment form EB , mainstay clinical management base protection avoidance provoke factor . Chronic nonhealing erosion ulcer treat conventional split-thickness skin graft . Alternatively patient may benefit use autologous allogeneic culture keratinocyte graft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Observational Study Evaluate Apligraf ( R ) Nonhealing Wounds Subjects With Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apligraf living bilayered cell therapy product . Apligraf construct Type I bovine collagen . The mechanism action Apligraf still unknown . No clinical evidence rejection Apligraf observe place acute chronic wound . Apligraf suggest act `` smart '' material wound heal interact surround environment promote healing . It provide component multiple action , interacts wound biological physical way , appear adapt wound environment probably produce numerous pro-healing cytokine . The purpose study evaluate use Apligraf treatment nonhealing wound subject epidermolysis bullosa . Apligraf evaluate efficacy safety compare conventional nonadherent dressing . The study pivotal , single center , within subject control observational trial rate wound healing , recurrence EB lesion , subject report pain compare wound treat Control treatment . Subjects 2 65 year age , inclusive , epidermolysis bullosa lesion screen study . For subject least two designated treatment site select . In case two comparable treatment site right side receive Apligraf leave side receive control . Efficacy assess clinical observation , wound tracing photograph .</detailed_description>
