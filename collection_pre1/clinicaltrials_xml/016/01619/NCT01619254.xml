	<brief_summary>Impact exert intestinal parasitic infection much high develop country . School-aged child high risk burden disease , specially many parasitic infection . The poor health result deficit physical cognitive development educational achievement . Nowadays , huge commitment among global community control intestinal parasitic infection improve nutritional status young child develop country . Large-scale anthelminthic drug administration vertical control programme still require foreseeable future , therefore , recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) . However , due inevitability re-infection endemic area , child need treat regularly , morbidity control consolidate , strategy must shift transmission control emphasise access clean water adequate sanitation . To lower dependency 'drug ' approach enhance sustainability , onset control activity , complementary measure implement , depend available resource . Therefore , investigator propose undertake randomise control trial ass impact simple easy-to-do hand hygiene intervention package ( hand wash soap hand finger nail clip ) intestinal parasitic infection prevalence , intensity re-infection rate haemoglobin concentration anaemia prevalence rate among 6-15 year old schoolchildren . Our result provide solid evidence hand hygiene practice affect infection prevalence re-infection rate , well , anaemia prevalence among highly vulnerable age group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The controlled prospective cohort study carry Kilte awlaelo wereda , north Ethiopia . A total 216 household least one school-aged child ( age 6-15 ) randomly select systematic random sample method . Different intervention package randomise among household . Intervention activity implement household level , use select child within household study unit . If one child per randomise household child receive intervention , two child , select simple random selection method , include trial . Selected child screen intestinal parasitosis , follow acquisition sign informed consent , recruit study treatment . Parasite negative child respective household randomly allocate intervention control group . Sequence allocation do central office individual know contact study sit household . Each intervention control group fix number participant , subject one study intervention . Children household group followed-up 6 month train fieldworker investigator accord develop protocol throughout study period . Parasitological , haemoglobin anthropometric data collect entry six month .</detailed_description>
