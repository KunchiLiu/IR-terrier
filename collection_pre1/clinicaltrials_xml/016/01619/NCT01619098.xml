	<brief_summary>Hospital readmission common , costly , potentially preventable . They also potentially responsive health system intervention . However , uncertain component care transition intervention efficacious , population , cost . This randomize control study part large project evaluate three-tiered quality improvement ( QI ) intervention intend reduce hospital readmission within 30 day post-discharge urban safety net hospital serf racially linguistically diverse population ( randomize control study evaluate Tier 3 ) . Few study evaluate care transition intervention reduce readmission among low-income , diverse patient population , accumulate evidence effect multi-faceted intervention readmission rate inconclusive . This project take advantage unique sequence three QI innovation reduce hospital readmission implement begin 2007 integrated safety net health care system . The `` discharge-transfer '' tier follow : 1 ) Tier 1 include comprehensive , individualized home care plan ( HCP ) review medical service floor nurse patient prior discharge ; 2 ) Tier 2 add electronic transmission HCP patient 's primary care medical home , business day follow discharge , Registered Nurse make outreach telephone call discharge patient confirm comprehension HCP address medical question need ; 3 ) Tier 3 add community health worker , Patient Navigator , participate bedside discussion develop rapport learn patient ' home situation , weekly outreach call assess patient ' need facilitate communication patient primary care team , reminder call patient prior medical appointment eliminate barrier outpatient follow-up . The Aim study register evaluate effect ongoing randomized natural experiment readmission , health care use , adherence medication instruction , preparedness discharge . This natural experiment feature random assignment one two QI intervention , Tier 2 Tier 3 , exclusively target patient high risk readmission , one follow risk factor readmission : discharge diagnosis congestive heart failure COPD ; length stay &gt; 3 day ; age &gt; 60 ; previous hospitalization within past six month . The investigator hypothesize Patient Navigator intervention ( Tier 3 ) compare usual care ( Tier 2 ) increase rate 30-day post-discharge PCP visit ; reduce 30-day hospital readmission rate ; reduce total number day hospital 180 day follow index admission high risk patient . The investigator expect PN intervention improve patient adherence medication instruction HCP reduce probability report problem post-discharge care .</brief_summary>
