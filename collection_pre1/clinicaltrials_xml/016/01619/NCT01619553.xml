	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keloids scar keep grow beyond border original wound . They typically persist several year , expand extensive period time sometimes call benign tumor . Keloids often lumpy surface often tender , itchy inflame around grow border . Keloids keloid patient run family . In inheritable form keloid possible one major gene mutation put family member risk develop keloid . There may variation DNA ( DNA make chromosome ) determine whether keloid become large aggressive stay small without many symptom . For study : - Send study participation kit consent phone - Collect saliva sample eligible individual - Obtain information regard keloid - Document keloid photos - If keloid patient undergo keloid surgery ask obtain scar tissue would otherwise discarded - Isolate DNA saliva sample - Perform genetic analysis DNA up-to-date method available identify genetic variation - Study laboratory genetic variation cause keloid</detailed_description>
