	<brief_summary>Nowadays approximately 80 % child adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LBL ) cure become long-term survivor . Avascular osteonecroses ( ON ) appear serious side-effect antileukaemic treatment . Frequently ON first diagnose higher irreversible stage ( ARCO III , IV ) . At advanced stage curative treatment option available . Hence ON associate considerable morbidity concern pain immobility go along long-term impairment quality life . Therefore early diagnosis ON follow-up child young adult ALL LBL press object . Within prospective multicentric observational OPAL-trial patient risk ( age 10 year old ) treat accord clinical trial ALL-BFM ( Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster Study Group ) , COALL NHL ( Non Hodgkin Lymphoma ) -BFM Germany examine regard development ON . By use treatment associate , risk orientate assessment examination incidence , symptoms clinical course ON investigate . The validity MRI screen early diagnosis ON child young adult analyse . Systematical investigation patient antileukaemic treatment intend contribute risk adapt diagnostic strategy serve data base subsequent evaluation preventive interventional approach treatment ON . Long-term objective reduction ON-associated morbidity .</brief_summary>
