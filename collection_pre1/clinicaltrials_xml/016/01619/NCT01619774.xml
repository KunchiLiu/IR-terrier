	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination 2 drug dabrafenib trametinib help control melanoma spread brain . The safety drug combination also study . Dabrafenib design block mutate BRAF protein . This mutation find mole skin melanoma cell . By block protein , drug may slow growth kill cancer cell protein . Trametinib design block certain protein cause cancer cell grow multiply . This may cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take dabrafenib trametinib together . You take 1 capsule trametinib mouth day . You take 2 capsule dabrafenib mouth 2 time every day ( 1 time morning 1 time evening , 12 hour apart - total 4 capsule day ) . If experience severe side effect , doctor research team may lower dose drug ( ) . You take study drug 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) room-temperature water . You eat drink anything besides water least 1 hour 2 hour take study drug . You give study drug diary record time dos take study drug . You bring diary study visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record , include symptom may . ( record previous 7 day ) - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - You physical exam ( one perform previous 7 day ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test ( perform previous 7 day ) . - You ask drug may take , feeling , side effect . - You blood draw visit research purpose . At point Day 4-10 Cycle 1 , kind biopsy screening . Your doctor and/or study team discus . On Days 8 Cycle 1 : - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You ask drug herbal supplement may take . - You ask drug may take , feeling , side effect . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You ask drug may take , feeling , side effect . - If disease spread brain doctor think need , MRI brain . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You ask drug may take , feeling , side effect - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test day 1 Cycle 2 4 . If disease worsens , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) also draw time . Every 8 week ( 2 cycle ) time start treatment , x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , skin exam , and/or bone scan check status disease . Every 12 week , ECHO perform . If point study symptom sign serious skin , eye , heart side effect , may refer dermatologist ophthalmologist , may ECG ECHO check heart 's health . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , start health problem , intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : You end-of-study visit within 4 week last dose study drug . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Your weight , vital sign , performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , and/or bone scan check status disease take study reason disease get bad . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - You kind mandatory biopsy screening . You may allow continue receive study drug time biopsy ( 2 day ) even disease show response study drug . Your doctor and/or study team discus . Survival Follow-Up : After stop taking study drug , follow approximately every 3 month ( either clinic visit contact phone letter ) 5 year death . If call , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . This investigational study . Both trametinib dabrafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type melanoma . Their use together study investigational . Up 45 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
