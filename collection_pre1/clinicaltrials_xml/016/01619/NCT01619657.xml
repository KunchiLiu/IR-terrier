	<brief_title>Preventive Inhalation Hypertonic Saline Infants With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) remain one common lethal genetic disease Europe North America . Despite substantial increase life expectancy past decade , many CF patient still die young adulthood due chronic progressive CF lung disease cause defective fluid transport airway epithelia cause dehydration airway surface , turn lead impair mucociliary clearance , chronic airway mucus obstruction , inflammation infection . Recent evidence study mouse model CF lung disease suggest preventive improvement airway surface hydration may effective treatment early reversible mucus obstruction inflammation , thus delay ameliorate progressive damage lung CF patient . Hypertonic saline ( HS ) osmotic agent improve airway surface hydration , inhalation 6 % HS already establish , safe , effective maintenance therapy improve mucociliary clearance lung function , reduces pulmonary exacerbation older child ( &gt; 6 year ) adults chronic CF lung disease fix lung damage . However , effect HS preventive therapy study , therapy available preventive improvement airway dehydration mucociliary dysfunction CF . This investigator initiate clinical trial monocentric , randomize , double-blind , control pilot study safety efficacy preventive early inhalation HS newborns infant CF diagnose newborn period either CF newborn screening ( CF-NBS ) another reason ( e.g . meconium ileus ) young 4 month age time enrolment . Participating patient randomize 6 % HS 0.9 % isotonic saline ( IS ) active comparator . In group , patient inhale study solution twice daily 52 week . At begin , end study , different measurement undertaken determine effect HS safety , radiologic and/or functional alteration lung , number exacerbation , time first detection CF pathogen , health-related quality life . We expect result study provide first evidence safety efficacy preventive therapy improve airway surface hydration target CF basic defect may thus delay and/or ameliorate chronic damage lung patient CF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Confirmed diagnosis CF establish neonatal period either via CF newborn screening ( NBS ) symptoms typical CF ( e.g . meconium ileus ) , positive family history positive prenatal screen fulfil least one follow three criterion : sweat chloride â‰¥ 60mEq/L two CF cause mutation CFTR gen alteration transepithelial potential difference nasal rectal epithelia typical CF . 2 . Age enrolment 0 4 month . 3 . Patient 's parent 's ability comply medication use , study visit , study procedure judge investigator ( therefore parent understand character study individual consequence ) . 4 . Participation study voluntary . Only patient , whose parent legal guardian give write consent , include . 1 . Born &lt; 30 week gestation . 2 . Prolonged mechanical ventilation first 3 month life . 3 . A significant medical disease condition CF likely interfere child 's ability complete entire protocol . 4 . Previous major surgery except meconium ileus . 5 . Other major organ dysfunction , exclude pancreatic hepatic dysfunction another condition due cystic fibrosis . 6 . Physical finding would compromise safety subject quality study data determine investigator . 7 . History adverse reaction sedation . 8 . Known hypersensitivity study treatment . 9 . Participation interventional study time . Criteria , lead displacement procedure sedation child recover : Clinically significant upper airway obstruction determine investigator ( e.g . severe laryngomalacia , markedly enlarge tonsil , significant snoring , diagnose obstructive sleep apnoea ) . Acute intercurrent respiratory infection , define increase cough , wheeze , respiratory rate onset 2 week precede visit . Oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % initial pulmonary function test initial MRI . Severe gastroesophageal reflux , define persistent frequent emesis despite antireflux therapy .</criteria>
