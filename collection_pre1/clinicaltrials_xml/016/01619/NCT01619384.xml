	<detailed_description>The gut microbiota know integral gastrointestinal health disease . Psychological stress show significantly alter gastrointestinal microbiota rat , rhesus monkey , human . These study consistently show decrease lactobacilli among change specie correlate increase diarrheal symptom . While unclear whether stress cause diarrhea lead indirectly disruption native microbiota , whether stress lead directly change microbiota lead diarrhea ; grow body evidence support latter . Differences microbiota also show present irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) predispose protect form diarrhea include bacterial gastroenteritis radiation-induced diarrhea . In addition , treatment probiotic contain lactobacillus specie show help alleviate IBS symptom . Stress hypothesize act microbiota via brain-gut axis endocrine , immunological , and/or neurological pathway . This propose study aim determine whether decrease stress level person posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) &amp; IBS lead change intestinal microbiota , assess 3 week enrollment . It also seek determine change intestinal microbiota correlate decrease IBS symptom . We propose use broad-range bacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR 454 pyrosequencing characterize fecal microbiota correlate change bacterial community IBS symptom baseline completion 8-week-stress reduction course 15 patient PTSD &amp; IBS compare finding 5 patient PTSD &amp; IBS undergo usual care without stress-reduction course .</detailed_description>
