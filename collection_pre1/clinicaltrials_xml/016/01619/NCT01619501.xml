	<brief_summary>The overall goal research enhance investigator understand pathway involve lung cancer , identify new biomarkers and/or therapeutic target . By compare gene expression normal lung tissue tumor grow lung-specific C/EBPa KO mouse , investigator identify Bmi-1 proto-oncogene abnormally upregulated C/EBPa-deleted tumor . Subsequently , investigator validate observation human lung cancer , implicate investigator KO mice effective discovery tool lung cancer research . Through similar approach , investigator already identify ( Sonic Hedgehog , SHH ) , plan identify pathway abnormally regulate C/EBPa-/- tumor . In parallel , investigator proceed define clinical relevance SHH pathway newly-discovered molecular aberration , analyze expression correlate C/EBPa expression sample patient NSCLC NUHS . If investigator preliminary data Bmi-1 confirm , proto-oncogene may generate useful correlate could use diagnosis treatment lung cancer , well identify new prognostic/predictive marker lung cancer . Similarly , SHH pathway-components may behave potential biomarkers therapeutic tool C/EBPa-related lung cancer . This proposal seek test hypothesis pathway dysregulated lung tumor grow lung-specific C/EBPa KO model utilized discovery tool identify gene involve human lung cancer pathogenesis .</brief_summary>
