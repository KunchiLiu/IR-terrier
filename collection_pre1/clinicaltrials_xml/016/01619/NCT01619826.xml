	<brief_title>Enhancing Children 's Cognitive Brain Health Through Physical Activity Training ( FITKids2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term objective project develop understanding lifestyle factor influence cognitive brain health child also reduce sedentary nature today 's youth . Previous research find physical activity intervention enhance variety aspect cognition brain structure function child , old adult , individual neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson 's disease multiple sclerosis . More specifically , previous research child researcher find high fit child possess large hippocampi turn relate well relational memory lower fit counterpart . The researcher also observe high fit child exhibit efficient executive control indicate performance measure event-related brain potential . While intrigue , cross-sectional data enable u establish causality physical activity cognition . In current study researcher substantially extend previous research examine influence 9 month randomize controlled afterschool physical activity program cognition brain health . Cognition assess battery task standardized achievement test 9 month intervention activity group wait list control ( receive intervention follow year ) . Children also participate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) session intervention ( comparable time wait list control ) . In session researcher measure structural aspect brain include regional volume gray matter integrity white matter tract ( diffusion tensor image ) functional aspect brain function use fMRI activity record child perform series executive control memory task . The researcher anticipate , base cross-sectional study child previous longitudinal study older adult , child physical activity program show large regional brain volume , particularly brain region subserve executive control relational memory , efficient brain function , indexed task-related rest state fMRI . Furthermore , researcher anticipate change accompany improvement memory executive control process . Given recent trend identify decreased level physical activity health status preadolescents , understand potential benefit physical activity cognition great interest . It imperative factor positively influence cognitive function child examine maximize health effective functioning individual progress lifespan .</detailed_description>
