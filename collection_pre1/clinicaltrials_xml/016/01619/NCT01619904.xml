	<brief_summary>A Pancreas Transplant accept treatment patient Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ( IDDM ) end-organ failure . Simultaneous Pancreas Kidney ( SPK ) Transplant do 90 % case . At present 5- 8 % 30-day mortality 80 % graft survival 1 year . At Manchester Royal Infirmary ( MRI ) approximately 40 case do per year . Goal-Directed Therapy ( GDT ) involve fluid resuscitation intra-operatively early post-operative period , guide cardiac output monitoring . The mechanism therapeutic benefit think relate improved tissue oxygenation oxygen delivery . There number study show significantly improve biochemical marker inflammation animal model study septic patient ( patient overwhelm infection ) follow GDT . Studies also show GDT improve clinical outcome post-operative patient serum inflammatory mediator . These study look `` major abdominal surgery '' none investigate transplant patient . Given nature surgery feel patient would benefit reduced Intensive Care Unit stay , reduce length hospital stay reduce rate post-operative complication . The study conduct adult patient undergo pancreas transplant MRI . It last 2 year hope recruit 60 patient Patients randomised Standard Therapy ( ST ) GDT group , ST current practice . Each intervention last six hour post-operatively continue normal care thereafter . Omental fat biopsy take patient intra-operatively blood sample take patient regular interval 72 hour intra- post- operatively . Patients follow daily in-patient three-monthly interval out-patients 1 year .</brief_summary>
