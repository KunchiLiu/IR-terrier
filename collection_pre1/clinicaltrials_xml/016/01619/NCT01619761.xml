	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give cell call natural killer ( NK ) cell receive chemotherapy treatment UCB transplant improve response patient leukemia , lymphoma , MM . The safety treatment whether NK cell lessen risk graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) also study . Patients disease CD20-positive also receive rituximab study . The first 3 patient enrol study receive NK cell receive cord blood transplant . UCB NK cell may able kill leukemia , lymphoma , myeloma cell remain body chemotherapy treatment . The UCB cell also design increase blood production strengthen immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration Study Procedures : Two ( 2 ) UCB unit select give . If enrolled third patient enrol , one select unit NK cell separate . The NK cell separate UCB unit use machine call CliniMACS system . This machine use certain kind cell antibody-coated magnetic bead separate NK cell . The separated NK cell `` grown '' increase number give . The drug aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ) add NK cell attempt improve function . The aldesleukin wash NK cell give . The second UCB unit give without NK cell separation . For UCB transplant schedule , day transplant call minus day ( Day -2 , Day -1 , etc. ) . The day transplant call Day 0 . The day transplant call plus day ( Day +1 , Day +2 , etc. ) . You receive 1 2 chemotherapy treatment choose doctor . The treatment select base disease status . Treatment Plan # 1 : On Day -8 , admit hospital begin receive fluid vein hydrate . The fluid give continuous ( non-stop ) infusion leave hospital . If disease CD20-positive , admit hospital Day -9 . Your study doctor discus . On Days -8 -2 , take lenalidomide mouth 1 time day . The capsule take around time every day cup ( 8 oz . ) water . Do break , chew , open lenalidomide capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day . Do double regular dose make miss dose . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . If disease CD20-positive , receive rituximab vein 6 hour Day -8 . On Days -7 -4 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . On Day -4 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute . On Day -2 , receive NK cell vein 30 minute ( first 3 patient receive NK cell ) . On Day -1 , receive study drug NK cell . On Day 0 , receive UCB transplant . Treatment Plan # 2 : On Day -8 , admit hospital begin receive fluid vein hydrate . The fluid give continuous ( non-stop ) infusion leave hospital . If disease CD20-positive , admit hospital Day -9 . Your study doctor discus . If disease CD20-positive , receive rituximab vein 6 hour Day -8 . On Days -7 -4 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . On Day -7 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour mesna vein 30 minute . Mesna give low risk side effect bladder cause cyclophosphamide . On Days -7 -2 , take lenalidomide mouth 1 time day . The capsule take around time every day cup ( 8 oz . ) water . Do break , chew , open lenalidomide capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day . Do double regular dose make miss dose . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . On Day -3 , receive total body irradiation ( TBI ) . TBI involve delivery high dos radiation design destroy cancer cell and/or low immune system order low risk body reject new stem cell . On Day -2 , receive NK cell vein 30 minute ( first 3 patient receive NK cell ) . On Day -1 , receive study drug NK cell . On Day 0 , receive UCB transplant . Supportive Drugs : You give drug help prevent side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Starting Day 0 , begin receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) needle skin 1 time every day white blood count begin recover . Filgrastim design make white blood cell grow . This may help fight infection . Starting Day -2 , begin receive tacrolimus vein non-stop infusion able take mouth . You take tacrolimus mouth 2 time day 6 month . After , tacrolimus dose may reduce GVHD . Your doctor discus . Starting Day -3 , begin take mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) mouth 3 time day food . If able take tablet mouth , receive MMF vein 2 hour , 2 time day . If GVHD Day 100 , dose MMF reduce . If miss dose MMF tell study doctor . You try make dose later . Study Tests : You stay hospital 2-4 week UCB transplant . While hospital , check side effect may blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test whenever doctor feel necessary . After release hospital , must remain Houston area monitor infection transplant-related side effect Day 100 . During time , return clinic 1 time week follow test procedure perform : - You ask feel side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . About 4 week transplant ( around Day 42 ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check side effect , include GVHD . The blood also use check UCB `` receive '' body . At 3 , 6 , 12 month UCB transplant , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test check side effect , include GVHD . The blood also use check UCB `` receive '' body . - You ask feel side effect may . - You may bone marrow biopsy check status disease doctor think necessary . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Length Study : Your participation study complete 12-month study visit . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , doctor think best interest , unable follow study direction . You also take study unable receive UCB transplant , need medical treatment allow study , infection . You must talk study doctor want leave study early . It may life-threatening leave study start receive study drug UCB transplant . This investigational study . Cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , melphalan , lenalidomide , UCB transplant procedure FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . Cyclophosphamide approve treatment CLL . Fludarabine approve treatment refractory CLL . Melphalan approve treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) use transplant conditioning regimen . Lenalidomide approve treatment low risk myelodysplastic syndrome MM . Rituximab approve treatment CD20 positive B-cell lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( combination chemotherapy ) . The use NK cell patient investigational . Up 13 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
