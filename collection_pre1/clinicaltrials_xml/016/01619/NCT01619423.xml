	<brief_summary>The present trial design determine whether pre-treatment PledOx lower frequency severity side effect FOLFOX6 administration patient metastatic colorectal cancer . The efficacy two different dos PledOx assess add FOLFOX6 chemotherapy first line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial PledOx + FOLFOX6 Compared Placebo + FOLFOX6 Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally , nearly 800 000 colorectal cancer believe occur annually . Approximately half patient colorectal cancer develop metastatic disease . These patient often offer chemotherapy FOLFOX6 regimen ( FOL = FOLic acid ; F = Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) ; OX = OXaliplatin ) The use FOLFOX6 , however , hamper high incidence severity adverse reaction . In current trial patient receive antioxidant agent PledOx one two different dos , placebo , first 8 cycle FOLFOX6 treatment .</detailed_description>
