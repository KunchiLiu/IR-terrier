	<brief_summary>The HER2 status breast cancer patient may change course disease . In 30 % initially HER2-negative patient circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , HER2-positive CTCs detect peripheral blood sample ( 1 ) . At present , unclear therapy base HER2 status CTC offer clinical benefit patient . The DETECT III - trial compare lapatinib , HER2-targeted therapy combination standard therapy versus standard therapy alone patient , initially HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer HER2-positive circulate tumor cell . As one first interventional trial base assessment CTC phenotype , DETECT III - trial aim evaluate efficacy HER2-targeted therapy patient MBC HER2-positive CTCs well significance CTC early predictive marker treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent study participation . 2 . Metastatic breast cancer treat surgery radiotherapy . The primary tumor and/or biopsy metastatic site locoregional recurrence must confirm cancer histopathology . Estrogen Receptor ( EG ) Progesterone Receptor ( PgR ) status must document . 3 . Primary tumor tissue and/or biopsy metastatic site locoregional recurrence investigate HER2 status investigation show HER2negativity ( i.e . : immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) score 01+ 2+ fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) negative FISH negative , whichever perform ) . 4 . Evidence HER2positive CTCs . Evidence assume follow hold : At least one CTC could extract 7.5 ml patient blood mean CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit ( Veridex LLC ) At least one extract CTCs find HER2positive . HER2 status must assess mean IHC FISH . 5 . Indication standard chemo endocrine therapy whose combination lapatinib either approve ( see SPC Tyverb® 250 mg tablet ) investigate prior clinical trial ( see table section 8.2.1. ) . 6 . Tumor evaluation perform within 6 week randomization result available . 7 . Patients must least one lesion accurately measure accord RECIST guideline version 1.1 [ Eisenhauer 2009 ] . 8 . Age ≥ 18 year . 9 . ECOG Score &lt; 2 10 . Adequate organ function within 7 day randomization , evidence follow laboratory result : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/µL , platelet count ≥ 100000/µL , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN , AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN , serum alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN , ( Serum alkaline phosphatase may &gt; 2.5 × ULN bone metastases present AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5× ULN ) creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl 177µmol/L International normalize ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT PTT ) ≤ 1.5 × ULN Please note : These laboratory criterion refer lapatinib therapy ; respect standard anticancer therapy relevant summary product characteristic ( SPCs ) observe additionally . 11 . Left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % , case plan standard chemotherapy anthracyclines ≥ 55 % , case within normal institutional limit measure echocardiogram 12 . In case patient child bear potential : Negative pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 7 day prior randomization , Contraception mean reliable method ( i.e . nonhormonal contraception , IUD , double barrier method , vasectomy sexual partner , complete sexual abstinence ) . Patient must consent maintain contraception 28 day completion study treatment . 1 . History hypersensitivity reaction attribute compound similar chemical biological composition lapatinib . 2 . History &gt; 3 chemotherapy line metastatic disease ( chemotherapy line define new chemotherapy modification exist chemotherapy regimen regardless reason change ) . 3 . Treatment investigational agent type anticancer therapy trial within 4 week prior randomization 6 week case nitrosoureas mitomycin C. 4 . Adverse event due prior anticancer therapy &gt; Grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE ) time randomization . 5 . Antiretroviral therapy due HIV infection . 6 . Current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . 7 . Concurrent disease condition might interfere adequate assessment evaluation study data , medical disorder would make patient 's participation unreasonably hazardous . 8 . Other malignant disease within last 3 year apart CIN uterine cervix skin basalioma . 9 . Disease condition might restrain ability take absorb oral medication . This include malabsorption syndrome , requirement intravenous ( IV ) alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption ( example resection small bowel stomach ) , uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease ) diseases significantly affect gastrointestinal function well inability swallow retain oral medication reason . 10 . Active cardiac disease , define : History uncontrolled symptomatic angina , history arrhythmia require medication , clinically significant , exception asymptomatic atrial fibrillation require anticoagulation , myocardial infarction le 6 month study entry , uncontrolled symptomatic congestive heart failure , ejection fraction institutional normal limit , cardiac condition , opinion treat physician would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . 11 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric social condition would prohibit understanding rendering inform consent might interfere patient 's adherence protocol . 12 . Life expectancy &lt; 3 month . 13 . Male patient . 14 . Pregnancy nursing . 15 . Primary tumor biopsy metastatic site locoregional recurrence show HER2positivity . 16 . Any prior treatment antiHER2 direct therapy .</criteria>
