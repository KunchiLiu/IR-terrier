	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma incurable bone marrow cancer characterize abnormal expansion plasma cell secrete monoclonal immunoglobulin . Over year , molecular genetic heterogeneity disease dissect . With maturation technology , time ripe apply genomics diagnose , classify , risk-stratify prognosticate myeloma clinical setting use information guide current treatment . The investigator hypothesize use gene expression profile single test economical , efficient accurate compare current standard panel test do diagnosis . The investigator also hypothesize investigator use predictive marker identify prospectively patient respond Velcade effective trebasedonatment , ability measure depth response beyond conventional complete response become important since patient achieve conventionally determine complete response . Using cohort patient treated standard treatment protocol base Velcade-based induction treatment follow consolidation maintenance treatment , investigator study specifically feasibility accuracy gene expression diagnostics , predictive power investigator predefined predictive marker clinical utility minimal residual disease measurement myeloma . The result investigator study allow u improve diagnosis , prognostication MM patient 1 . The investigator hypothesize speed diagnosis , provide comprehensive information classification risk stratification MM patient completely replace current FISH assay may cheaper . 2 . The investigator hypothesize TRAF3 deletion mutation MYC activation identify patient significantly well response Velcade . 3 . Modern treatment induce deep response . More sensitive method disease detection allow u know fully extent response treatment</brief_summary>
