	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study determine whether 18F-FLT PET/CT predict patient poorer progression free survival overall survival advance Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) first-line therapy , therefore , need aggressive treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluating Role F-18 FLT PET/CT Therapeutic Decision Making Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard therapy patient advance NSCLC platinum base doublet chemotherapy . Current first-line chemotherapy usually limit 4-6 cycle , prolong treatment result additional benefit may often cause toxicity . Until recently , treatment guideline recommend withhold administration later-line systemic anti-cancer treatment disease progression . There several report suggest maintenance therapy follow first-line chemotherapy offer improve survival advance stage patient . This approach involve administration active treatment immediately first-line chemotherapy , thus maintain clinical benefit initially obtain . However , drug relate toxicity cost great concern . There may also patient less aggressive disease immediate transition maintenance therapy first-line result overtreatment . Therefore , select patient require aggressive treatment earlier intervention necessary . If FLT PET/CT discriminate patient short progression free survival overall survival pilot study , patient could select aggressive earlier treatment maintenance therapy , investigator could expect prolong survival reduce adverse event cost accompany inconsequential therapy FLT PET/CT .</detailed_description>
