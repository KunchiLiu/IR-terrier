	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common form chronic liver disease . In absence chronic alcohol abuse liver disease , NAFLD incorporate wide spectrum liver pathology define fatty infiltration liver ( simple hepatosteatosis ) . It progress non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) later fibrosis , cirrhosis , eventually patient may develop hepatocellular carcinoma without cirrhosis . The exact cause NAFLD yet clear , therefore , active area research . The diagnosis NAFLD achieve histological examination liver biopsy ( invasive ) , non-invasive marker use serum biomarkers image technique still development . Pathological diagnosis subcategorized base several score system . More widely use Brunt Score NAS ( NAFLD activity score ) Kleiner 's modified NAS . Obesity highly associate NAFLD , epidemic obesity make NAFLD prevalent . In addition insulin resistance link NAFLD explain increase influx free fatty acid ( FFAs ) liver . FFA undergoes either Î²-oxidation esterification glycerol form triglyceride ( TGs ) , result additional source fat liver . Due strong association NAFLD obesity , weight reduction procedure use management NAFLD . In fact , show effective several study . However , study report liver deterioration bariatric intervention . This conflict make effect bariatric procedure challenge field study . Consequently study aim examine histologic , metabolic liver function change induce different therapeutic bariatric procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Bariatric Surgeries Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>35 consecutive patient refer bariatric surgery recruit either obesity clinic , inpatient ( schedule bariatric surgery ) . A detailed history complete physical examination do first visit along anthropometric measure ; routine blood test , liver function , hormonal assessment , certain metabolic inflammatory marker evaluate . They also abdominal ultrasound initial NAFLD assessment , fibroscan detect liver fibrosis , MRI measure hepatic fat content body fat composition include intra-abdominal extra-abdominal fat . These patient ask lose certain amount kilo ( depend BMI surgeon preference ) original weight , order become candidate bariatric surgery King Saud University Hospital ( KKUH ) . At second visit , ( lose recommend amount weight ) ass weight loss ; obtain blood hormonal inflammatory marker assessment . Nonetheless , lose weight treat surgeon give third appointment , consider third visit second visit ; preform investigation mention . In case interpret result respect total duration `` surgery '' weight loss . During operation , tissue biopsy take core needle biopsy liver sharp non-thermal instrument subcutaneous fat , visceral fat , abdominal muscle immediately skin incision . A CAP certify tissue manager would process tissue . Liver biopsy slice two part ; first half histological evaluation , half store tissue study . The histologic slide stain hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) , Masson Trichrome stain microscopic evaluation . This evaluation provide single histopathologist blind patient ' clinical condition , order biopsy . Follow Up : After surgery follow appointment schedule 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , annually till 5 year . The following do visit : 1 . Thorough physical exam per CRF . 2 . Take blood sample evaluate liver function , metabolic , inflammatory change use parameter baseline . 3 . Request : fibroscan abdominal ultrasound . Second , third fourth liver biopsy take percutaneously 3 month , 1 year , 5 year follow initial biopsy respectively . These biopsy obtain use core tissue biopsy ultrasound guidance histological assessment tissue study . Another MRI schedule 1 year surgery . Specimens collect trial part King Saud University Liver Disease Research Centre Biobanking follow policy procedure within biobanking protocol approve IRB committee .</detailed_description>
