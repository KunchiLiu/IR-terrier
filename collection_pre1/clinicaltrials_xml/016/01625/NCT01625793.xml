	<brief_summary>The current study design identify behavioral physiological mechanism positive social connectivity ( PCS ) negative social process ( NSP ) interact psychosocial stress promote resilience context illness . The investigator model inflammation ( central element disease state ) use treatment interferon ( IFN ) -alpha , provide standardized regimen chronic cytokine exposure know produce profound behavioral disturbance , include depression , fatigue sickness , high percentage individual . To objectively assess social process , current project employ Electronically Activated Recorder ( EAR ) , periodically unobtrusively record snippet ambient sound people 's momentary environment . To objectively assess behavioral physiological response psychosocial stress current project employ Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ) , standardized laboratory stressor know reliably activate behavioral , neuroendocrine inflammatory response . These novel methodology model system employ test hypothesis ( ) pre-existing affiliative prosocial behavior promote resilience context chronic inflammation ( b ) —conversely—chronic inflammation reduce affiliative prosocial behavior via effect stress reactivity , neuroendocrine function sleep . Finally , explore ( c ) potential mediating role stress physiology . To test hypothesis , 110 subject chronic hepatitis C virus infection randomize receive treatment pegylated IFN-alpha plus ribavirin postpone treatment 6 week : 55 subject University Arizona 55 subject Emory University . Prior randomization 6 week later subject evaluate EAR sleep actigraphy home environment undergo TSST 14 hour diurnal neuroendocrine immune measurement .</brief_summary>
