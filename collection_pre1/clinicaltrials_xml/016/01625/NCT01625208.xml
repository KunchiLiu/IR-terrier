	<brief_summary>This study examine successfully nerve block frozen hand surgery . Traditionally , nerve freeze base neck , clavicle collarbone ( supraclavicular block ) . This mostly successful , provide anesthesia entire arm . Occasionally , additional nerve block require arm , supraclavicular block may miss segment , take long come . In study investigator compare traditional technique , similar low volume supraclavicular block plus immediate low volume block one nerve arm ( ulnar median nerve block , depend digit operate ) . The investigator compare success rate , speed onset , procedural comfort length time weakness numbness , plus adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supraclavicular Versus Combined Block Ulnar Median Distribution Hand Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Regional anesthesia commonly employ surgery hand . It well tolerate patient high safety record . The common form regional anesthesia surgery supraclavicular block successful case . Occasionally additional nerve block and/or moderate sedation require . The frequent additional nerve block require ulnar median nerve . This study aim address whether low volume supraclavicular block plus selective ulnar median nerve block reduces time take onset anesthesia , reduces time post-operative complete limb immobility , improve surgical success block , increase patient satisfaction , compare standard block . The study power detect 25 % difference successful surgical anesthesia . Purpose To ascertain whether addition ulnar median nerve block lower volume supraclavicular block speed onset consistency anesthesia , return limb function patient undergoing hand surgery compare standard supraclavicular block . Hypothesis Low volume supraclavicular block plus selective distal nerve block speed onset anesthesia , improve surgical anesthetic success decrease time return upper limb function compare standard supraclavicular block . Study population Patients 18 year age , list hand surgery ulnar median distribution University Alberta Hospital . The study commence follow ethical approval run 160 patient enrol . Exclusion criterion - Patient refusal - Allergy amide local anesthetic - Severe coagulopathy - Bilateral upper limb surgery - Surgery involve bone graft iliac crest - Request general anesthetic surgical research team ( example , nerve stimulation study ) Methods Consent obtain one investigator . Patients wish participate study receive either brachial plexus block general anesthetic deem appropriate attending anesthesiologist . Patients undergo surgery ring pinky finger randomise receive either standard supraclavicular block , low volume supraclavicular block plus ulnar nerve block . Patients receive surgery thumb , index , middle finger randomize similar fashion separate `` median '' group . All block place designated block area prior transfer operating room either experienced staff anesthesiologist supervise fellow regional anesthesia . The block assess prior surgery motor sensory dysfunction , block may augment necessary . The surgeon determine effectiveness surgical anesthesia , indicate need surgical local anesthetic top , heavy sedation general anesthesia anesthesiologist . Sedation also administer per patient request . Post-operatively , patient satisfaction questionnaire complete . A phone call conduct following day . Primary outcome measure 1 . Successful surgical anesthesia Secondary outcome measure 1 . Time successful anesthetic block 2 . Procedural time 3 . Duration analgesia 4 . Duration weakness 5 . Patient satisfaction Safety concern Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block perform many year , low complication rate . The addition peripheral nerve block uncommon , pose minimal additional risk . Major concern 1 . Pneumothorax 2 . Nerve damage 3 . Intravascular injection cause local anesthetic toxicity 4 . Infection Minor concern 1 . Block failure 2 . Transient hemidiaphragmatic paresis 3 . Transient Horner 's syndrome 4 . Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy 5 . Haematoma injection site Study Protocol Patients transfer block area . Midazolam titrate appropriate level . A time procedure undertaken ensure correct side block . The skin disinfect . The ultrasound probe scan supraclavicular fossa identify subclavian artery . The brachial plexus identify postero-lateral artery . Standard supraclavicular block The skin infiltrate lidocaine . A needle attached nerve stimulator introduce . The target area infero-medial brachial plexus . In position 10 - 20 ml 3:1 Lidocaine 2 % : 0.5 % Bupivacaine solution inject . A superficial injection make . A 10-20 ml Lidocaine : Bupivacaine solution deposit . The total volume record maximum 30mls . Low volume supraclavicular block ulnar nerve block The skin infiltration target needle standard supraclavicular block . However , maximum 15ml solution inject . The arm abduct supinate . The ulnar artery identify . The ulnar nerve see medial artery . 5ml solution deposit adjacent nerve . Low volume supraclavicular block median nerve block The skin infiltration target needle standard supraclavicular block . However , maximum 15ml solution inject . The patient 's elbow flex nerve visualize ultrasound antecubital fossa lie medial brachial artery . Anesthetic solution deposit forearm target median nerve . Intra-operative management Following block assessment , patient transfer operating theatre . Additional midazolam may give . Propofol 50mcg/kg/minute commence require , rate increase 75mcg/kg/minute . If patient unable tolerate procedure , sedation increase least 100mcg/kg/minute block deem unsuccessful surgical block . Block Assessment Patients assess sensory motor blockade nerve 5 minute interval . A successful anesthetic block define sensation score ulnar median area 0 1 , ulnar median motor score 2 less . If occur standard group , ulnar median nerve block perform . If occur combine group , general anesthetic occur . Nerve block extent may also assess objective mean ( e.g. , strength test dynamometer ) . A successful surgical block define require LA top-up infiltration , sedation great 75mcg/kg/min . Data collection Data collect study sheet . Information keep confidential patient identifier form . The data collect age , sex , height weight , type block use , amount local anesthetic use , length time take perform block , block assessment data . Intraoperative data note whether additional local anaesthetic , heavy sedation general anesthesia require reason . Post-operative data patient questionnaire ask block-related surgery-related pain score . A follow phone call day surgery determine time return power sensation arm .</detailed_description>
