	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) predict second leading cause disability worldwide year 2020 . The economic burden depression United States significant : $ 83.1 billion 2000 increase . Much burden come high rate sub-optimal treatment outcome associate disorder . Indeed , 50 % MDD patient recover less 12 week adequate treatment , 20 % patient fail adequately respond currently available intervention . Moreover , current treatment come cost significant central nervous system ( CNS ) side effect , highlight need effective treatment few side effect . This study compare temperature range investigator preliminary study involve thermoafferent pathway result antidepressant action low temperature range expect activate pathway control condition , goal evaluate whether previous observation related temperature range question achieve level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Body Hyperthermia Major Depression ( MDD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct placebo control clinical trial determine Whole Body Hyperthermia antidepressant effect medically healthy patient moderate severe MDD . We plan recruit sample 30 medically healthy individual MDD randomize examine whether WBH demonstrate antidepressant effect compare control-WBH condition comprise mild heat WBH machine ( Heckel HT3000 ) . To determine acute sustained effect WBH depression severity , study include basic clinical psychiatric assessment 5 day WBH follow-up assessment 2 , 4 , 6 week follow WBH . Additionally , assessment conduct optional open treatment , 1 week follow open treatment , 3 month follow . To assess whether WBH affect individual relate people environment , well spend time general assess social process , study employ Electronically Activated Recorder ( EAR ) . Participants wear EAR device day , go life weekend . This weekend monitoring also include actigraphy assessment participant wear actigraphy device wake sleeping hour . In addition , blood obtain multiple time point assess plasma concentration biological predictor response mechanism action WBH . This study challenge exist paradigm determine peripheral afferent sensory pathway access treat MDD thus avoid problem expose brain non-selective drug .</detailed_description>
