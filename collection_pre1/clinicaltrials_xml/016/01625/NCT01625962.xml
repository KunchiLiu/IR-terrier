	<brief_summary>This prospective , longitudinal cohort study evaluate association index brain structure function ( measure baseline , soon possible injury ) course post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptom . Subjects service member sustain mild traumatic brain injury ( classify either `` impact-induced mTBI '' `` blast-induced mTBI '' ; n = 100 completers ) extracranial injury ( ECI ) evidence traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ( n = 100 completers ) . Subjects complete assessment battery baseline 6 month later include ( 1 ) structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) derive 3-Tesla magnet ; ( 2 ) event-related brain potential ( ERPs ) derive brain electrical activity ; ( 3 ) neurocognitive test ; ( 4 ) neurological soft sign ( NSS ) . Specific index brain structure function derive assessment hypothesize demonstrate significant relationship course PTSD symptom , measure baseline , 3 month , 6 month .</brief_summary>
