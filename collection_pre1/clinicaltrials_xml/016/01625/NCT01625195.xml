	<brief_summary>Nutrition key healthy age number disease investigator report imbalance distribution long chain omega-3 fatty acid ( LC-omega-3 ) elderly carrier apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ( APOE4 ) isoform . Carrying APOE4 isoform currently recognize important genetic risk factor cognitive decline . The investigator believe dysregulation LC-omega-3 metabolism intimately link high risk cognitive decline . The current project investigate whether causal relationship LC-omega-3-enriched diet cognition use , one hand , randomize double-blind placebo-controlled design hand , transgenic mouse carry human APOE4 . In study , investigator focus specifically distribution ( level ) LC-omega-3 lipoproteins age and/or APOE4 isoform evaluate whether dysfunctional transport LC-omega-3 associate low cognitive score visuospatial capacity , verbal fluency work memory . In APOE4 mouse , investigator evaluate LC-omega-3 brain uptake together level LC-omega-3 brain membrane level APOE protein within brain . The present investigation provide key basis understand develop nutritional strategy healthy age preservation cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERALL AIM : In human animal model , investigate imbalance distribution long chain omega-3 fatty acid ( LC-omega-3 ) plasma lipid lipoproteins brought age APOE4 genotype evaluate whether imbalance link cognitive function . BACKGROUND : Risk cognitive decline increase age . Epidemiological study strongly support link low risk cognitive decline high intake fatty fish contain LC-omega-3 . However , clinical study show imbalance distribution LC-omega-3 plasma lipid occur age carrier apolipoprotein E epsilon4 ( APOE4 ) genotype , important genetic risk cognitive decline . As consequence , imbalance appear contribute dysregulation LC-omega-3 metabolism high risk cognitive decline . Our preliminary result elderly human show visuospatial , verbal fluency work memory score improve 4 month supplementation 3 g/d LC-omega-3 , support beneficial role LC-omega-3 cognition elderly . How beneficial effect occur unknown potentially supplementation revers override imbalance brain LC-omega-3 uptake tissue content occur age APOE4 carrier . Molecular mechanism evaluate 4-month 15-month old transgenic mouse express human APOE4 . OVERALL HYPOTHESIS : Higher LC-omega-3 level lipoprotein associate high LC-omega-3 brain uptake membrane level APOE4 carrier lead well cognitive score visuospatial , verbal fluency work memory test . RESEARCH PLAN : Specific question address : 1 ) What role APOE4 blood lipoprotein causal relationship LC-omega-3-enriched diet cognition ? Three hundred participant age 20-80 old recruit randomized placebo ( corn oil ) 3 g/d omega-3 fatty acid supplement 6 month ( 150 subjects/group ) . LC-omega-3 use mostly VLDL LDL travel blood . Hence , collect blood sample monthly quantification LC-omega-3 level VLDL , LDL HDL , longitudinal follow-up LC-omega-3 throughout supplementation period . This provide key information regard difference lipoprotein content LC-omega-3 supplementation . We perform cognitive test focus visuospatial , verbal fluency work memory placebo LC-omega-3 treat group supplement . Age , sex APOE4 genotype interaction variables interest . Statistical association test cognitive score LC-omega-3 distribution lipoprotein also perform find best LC-omega-3 marker associate cognition .</detailed_description>
