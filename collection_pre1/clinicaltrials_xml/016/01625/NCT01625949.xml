	<brief_summary>Background : When acute myocardial infarction occur , artery supply infarct zone open within twenty four hour onset infarction . This clearly show beneficial . If patient present later 24 hour onset , stage large part damage heart irreversible . Intervening stage ( beyond 24 hour controversial ) . Some trial suggest open artery even stage positively modifies remodel process trial suggest benefit see . Hypothesis : Opening infarct relate artery 24 hour ( 6 month ) combine intracoronary stem cell therapy may provide incremental benefit.It possible lack benefit see late revascularization ( &gt; 24 hr ) MI may offset give intracoronary stem cell open artery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The benefit open infarct related artery period myocardial salvage ( In patient come medical attention within 24 hrs infarction ) question recent trial . On hand , Stem cell therapy myocardial infarction show improve myocardial function acute chronic phase . It possible lack benefit see late revascularization ( &gt; 24 hr ) MI may offset give intracoronary stem cell open artery . Patients recent myocardial infarction ( MI ) occlude infarct related artery supply large myocardial territory reduce ejection fraction randomize percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) arm PCI plus stem cell arm . The objective trial demonstrate open infarct relate artery 24 hour six month follow intracoronary stem cell therapy may provide incremental benefit . The primary objective To demonstrate benefit leave ventricular recovery ( improvement function echocardiogram Nuclear imaging : Multigated acquisition [ MUGA ] , reduction scar size tetrofosmin scan/Positron Emission Tomography [ PET ] . ) The secondary objective To demonstrate improvement functional capacity assess 6 minute walk test quality life assessment , along reduction first occurrence recurrent MI , hospitalization/treatment New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure , death</detailed_description>
