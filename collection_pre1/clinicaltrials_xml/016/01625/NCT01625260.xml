	<brief_title>A Study ALT-801 Patients With Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) Failure Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer fifth common cancer United States estimate 71,000 new case approximately 14,000 death 2009 . Bladder cancer also costliest treat per patient cancer , annual direct medical expenditures excess $ 3.7 billion United States . This largely approximately 70 % new case bladder cancer present non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) , tend recur , require repeat intervention long-term follow-up . NMIBC tumor usually treat surgical resection intravesical chemotherapy immunotherapy . Immunotherapy usually consist intravesical administration Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) . Recent study suggest BCG superior term efficacy decrease disease recurrence compare therapy . Although mechanism action BCG therapy lead clinical efficacy unclear , macrophage , T lymphocytes natural killer ( NK ) cell implicate critical mediator anti-tumor immune response . Consequently , BCG associate significant toxicity , approximately 20 % patient fail complete course therapy . In addition , many 30 % patient either fail respond therapy suffer disease recurrence within 5 year . Of , 30 % eventually die bladder cancer 50 % undergo radical cystectomy . Thus , novel therapy , either first-line salvage therapy , desperately need NMIBC prevent disease progression allow bladder preservation preserve quality life patient . Alternatively , novel therapy moderate significant often treatment-limiting side effect BCG immunotherapy also warrant . Additionally , immunotherapy well-established approach treat cancer type . One strategy receive attention treatment cytokine IL-2 enhance anti-tumor immunity . IL-2 implicate play pivotal role efficacy BCG treatment patient NMIBC . Studies demonstrate direct IL-2 intervention could benefit patient refractory resistant BCG treatment . Unfortunately , considerable toxicity associate treatment make difficult achieve effective dose site tumor limit population treat . Thus , critical need innovative strategy enhance effect IL-2 , reduce toxicity without compromise clinical benefit , treat diagnosis include NMIBC . Recombinant human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ; Proleukin® ) approve agent treatment adult metastatic melanoma renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . In particular , high dose intravenous IL-2 treatment demonstrate durable objective response rate indication . However , major toxicity associate regimen preclude widespread application . Altor Bioscience Corp. develop tumor-targeted IL-2 fusion protein , ALT-801 , comprise human recombinant IL-2 genetically link TCR domain capable bind tumor associate human p53 peptide present context HLA-A2 . Animal study indicate ALT-801 could useful therapeutic approach activate immune effector cell , bring together effector cell tumor cell stimulate immune cell-mediated activity . In addition , pre-clinical study ALT-801 NMIBC tumor model indicate ALT-801 monotherapy may provide clinical benefit patient NMIBC . Various mouse xenograft model also demonstrate ALT-801 increase efficacy lessen side effect high-dose rhIL-2 . Moreover , result conclude phase I clinical study monotherapy ALT-801 patient metastatic malignancy indicate ALT-801 give daily two 4-day cycle dose level 0.04 mg/kg well tolerate , exhibit favorable PK drug profile immunological potency , provide clinical benefit cancer patient . Also , high dose level ( 0.08 mg/kg ) ALT-801 associate well clinical benefit . Based finding , ALT-801 evaluate whether prevent disease progression allow bladder preservation maintain quality life patient BCG failure , define refractory , relapse intolerant , non-muscle invasive bladder cancer refuse medically fit undergo radical cystectomy recommend participate urologist standard next therapy per urologic guideline .</detailed_description>
