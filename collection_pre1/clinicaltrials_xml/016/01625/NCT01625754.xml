	<brief_summary>Many study show coronary artery disease ( CAD ) rapid decline memory expect increase risk develop dementia . It understand memory decline link CAD ; however , recently discover certain byproduct fat breakdown involved development CAD , call ceramides , harm brain cell . In present study investigator recruit 129 CAD patient cardiac rehabilitation facility measure memory performance blood ceramide concentration baseline , 3 month 6 month . The investigator also measure important blood messenger inflammation ass whether associated ceramide production . In addition , relationship ceramides aspect brain function , think speed ability plan sort information explore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) affect 19.8 % Canadians age 65 significantly affect quality life . Of particular importance , cognitive impairment , range cognitive complaint vascular dementia , frequently part clinical presentation CAD . Our prospective pilot data suggest 22.5 % CAD patient attend cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) evidence cognitive impairment low verbal memory performance , marker hippocampal function , predict poor CR outcome . The pathophysiological mechanism may contribute cognitive decline CAD fully elucidate . Ceramides metabolites sphingomyelin , lipid specie enrich out leaflet plasma membrane cell organelles tissue . Higher peripheral blood concentration ceramides associate development progression CAD . We propose use specific sensitive electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry ( ESI-MS/MS ) assay measure concentration ceramide specie human plasma elucidate relationship ceramides change verbal memory performance 6 month 129 subject CAD undergo CR . We hypothesize high plasma concentration long chain ceramide specie C22:0 C24:0 associate decline verbal memory performance overall cognitive performance assess standardized battery cognitive test recommend investigation vascular cognitive impairment . We also hypothesize change plasma concentration TNF-α ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) associate change plasma concentration C22:0 C24:0 6 month . This study aim clarify significance novel mechanism involve ceramides propagation inflammatory signal periphery brain mediating neurodegeneration associate CAD .</detailed_description>
