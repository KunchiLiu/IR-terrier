	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) major concern public health globally , well China , remarkable variation resource available health system performance note . Relatively limited information available evidence-based therapy incorporate appropriately routine clinical practice . Optimal revascularization strategy multiple vessel coronary artery disease patient remain subject debate interventional cardiologist surgeon . Practical apply knowledge large unselected population need guide practice policy quality improvement cost reduction . This study enroll patient diagnosis three-vessel disease , leave main disease significant lesion ( 50 % ) consecutively 25 tertiary hospital scatter China . At study entry , participant interview index hospitalization , collect information symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract medical record well trained professional abstractor . And CAG image review national international expert panel . At 1 month , 6 month , 12 month discharge , participant return clinic follow visit , face-to-face interview conduct get information clinical event , symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care recovery period . At 1-Month 12-Month follow-up visit , blood urine sample collect . Participants ' blood sample store future biologic genetic study . This study examine various real-life factor may affect multiple vessel coronary heart disease patient recovery PCI/CABG/medications , include patient ' characteristic treatment measure . Practical guideline , quality evaluative system , appropriateness criterion establish base finding , improve patient outcomes future finally .</detailed_description>
