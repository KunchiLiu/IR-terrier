	<brief_summary>Understanding bone growth achieve bone deformity correction re-mains one oldest challenge paediatric orthopaedics . The purpose study investigate clinical biomechanical effect implant growth modulation pediatric patient undergo correction leg length deformity knee . The primary aim study assess outcome growth modulation use Eight plate ( Orthofix ) time implant removal regard Adverse Events ( AE ) relate growth plate implant investigation . The secondary aim ass plan correction achieve achieve correction maintain implant removal . Furthermore , secondary aim include investigation number type revision surgery , proportion local AE well influence factor growth modulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Eight Plate Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One old mystery paediatric orthopaedics knowledge bone growth ability correct acquire bone deformity . Guiding growth bone deformity cor-rection harness ability grow bone undergo plastic deformity well-known pediatric orthopaedic principle . Nevertheless , still many open question concern growth guide growth . Several surgical option already exist correction angular de-formity leg length discrepancy . The gold standard remain corrective osteoÂ¬tomy growth arrest . Correction growth pose risk recurrence deformity growth . By mean , growth modulation involve major surgery require internal external fixation . Epiphysiodesis hemiepiphysiodesis , either permanent temporarily , do open percutaneous way . Permanent epiphysiodesis mainly perform use screw , temporary epiphysiodesis staple plate/screw system use . The treatment seem clinically effective , precise calculation remain growth optimal surgical timing crucial . Furthermore , underlie biomechanical property yet fully know . The objective study investigate clinical effect Eight Plate system growth modulation treatment pediatric patient undergo leg length correction deformity correction knee . The primary aim study assess outcome growth modulation removal implant regard AEs relate growth plate implant investigation . The secondary aim ass plan correction achieve achieve correction maintain Eight Plate removal . Furthermore , secondary aim include investigation number type revision surgery , functional deficit implant removal , additional local AE , assessment primary implant positioning , additional radiological parameter related implant leg alignment .</detailed_description>
