	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety efficacy different dos schedule AZD5363 , combination paclitaxel , treatment patient advance metastatic breast cancer . Also investigate select dose schedule AZD5363 combination paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel combination placebo treatment patient estrogen receptor-positive advanced metastatic breast cancer , include subgroup phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) tumor mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Safety , Tolerability Efficacy AZD5363 When Combined With Paclitaxel Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II multicentre , study investigate safety , tolerability efficacy twice-daily oral formulation AZD5363 combine weekly intravenous paclitaxel infusion patient advance metastatic breast cancer . Study treatment give 28-day cycle , comprise three week on-therapy follow one week off-therapy . The study conduct two part : Part A . Approximately 40 patient recruited Phase I multiple ascending-dose safety run-in evaluation two intermittent dose schedule ( 2 day per week 4 day per week ) AZD5363 give combination weekly paclitaxel . The study population female patient , 18 year old , advance metastatic breast cancer . The purpose Part A ass comparative safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics preliminary efficacy schedule determine one dose schedule AZD5363 take forward study Part B combination weekly paclitaxel . Part A assessment make dose-escalating cohort 3 6 patient determine recommend dose schedule . A total 6 patient must evaluate select dose level confirm recommend dose . All dose evaluation recommendation conduct Safety Review Committee . Part A Patients undergo assessment withdrawal study discontinuation study therapy . Part B . A minimum 100 patient recruit Phase II double-blind , placebo-controlled , stratify randomise evaluation two treatment regimen : AZD5363 ( dose select schedule Part A ) combination weekly paclitaxel vs. weekly paclitaxel plus placebo . The study population female patient Estrogen Receptor Positive advance metastatic breast cancer ; approximately 50 phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) mutation . Part B patient stratify PIK3CA tumor mutation status : tumour mutation positive tumor mutation not-detected . Under stratum patient randomize receive either paclitaxel + AZD5363 paclitaxel + placebo . The purpose Part B ass relative efficacy active placebo regimens comparison : progression-free survival , overall survival , tumor response , safety tolerability overall ER+ve advance metastatic breast cancer population , subgroup patient PIK3CA tumor mutation . Patient safety therapy tolerability monitor independent Safety Review Committee throughout course Part B . Part B patient follow assessment overall survival , withdrawal study .</detailed_description>
