	<brief_title>Computer Detection Diabetic Retinopathy Compared Clinical Examination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project multicenter , observational study compare accuracy IDX-DR computer detection system board certify ophthalmologist perform dilate eye examination identify mild NPDR without clinically significant diabetic macular edema mild NPDR without CSDME . Approximately 400-600 person diabetes recruit 5 clinical center . The ophthalmologist examines patient evaluate record status eye base his/her clinical examination . The study subject two fundus photograph take eye . The photographic image transfer central Reading Center University Pennsylvania interpret professional grader . The Reading Center transfer image IDx-DR , computer detection system . IDx-LLC , Sponsor study , access image . Data Reading Center interpretation consider `` gold standard '' . The result clinical examination IDX-DR compare gold standard well .</detailed_description>
