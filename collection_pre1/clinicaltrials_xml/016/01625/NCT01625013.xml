	<brief_summary>This study aim study use viscosupplementation treatment pain young individual active . Typically viscosupplementation consider intervention knee osteoarthritis often old patient less active . Many young active patient also develop knee osteoarthritis trauma surgery congenital reason . Treatment patient commonly steroid injection biologically detrimental effect cartilage compare viscosupplementation Synvisc One injection single injection use determine effectiveness reduce pain maintain active healthy lifestyle young patient age 30-50 year old .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study open label longitudinal cohort study natural history 3 year . Screening data review determine subject eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . Subjects enrol cohort baseline functional testing perform include motion gait analysis , 12 minute walk test , 3-day accelerometer data . Subjects receive single 6 mL intra-articular injection hylan G-F 20 target knee baseline . All ongoing treatment monitor 6 month interval 3 year duration study . Patients receive conservative treatment ( e.g. , oral medication , physical therapy , acupuncture , etc. , except injection treatment ) current treatment document patient encounter . An initial injection hylan G-F 20 inject symptomatic knee use standard supine lateral approach use 20 gauge needle . A face face follow visit carry 6 month first injection additional face face meeting every 6 month thereafter unless subject require additional injection hylan G-F 20 . Hylan G-F 20 treatment administer three time year study duration . After injection , follow measure carry use secure e-mail phone contact 6 week , 12 week , 18 week in-office evaluation injection . Follow consist WOMAC , Lysholm score , Tegner score . Patients may return retreatment hylan G-F 20 symptom recur least 4 month follow previous injection meet inclusion criterion pain level WOMAC A1 , C8 , C9 , C10 and/or C23 equal 2 . Patients require three injection hylan G-F 20 4 month less allowed exit cohort six-month follow follow third injection . Otherwise , patient follow reach 3 year follow , drop injection treatment surgical treatment . Therefore , patient would potentially able receive 9 injection 3 year study .</detailed_description>
