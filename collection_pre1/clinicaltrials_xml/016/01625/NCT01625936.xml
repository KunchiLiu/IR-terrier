	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm metastatic locally advanced renal cell carcinoma unresectable . Patients must disease evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors guideline ( RECIST ) , v1.1 . Disease sit must assess within 4 week study entry . Patients must treat least one prior conventional molecularly target therapy nonadjuvant setting . Conventional molecularly target therapy define include pazopanib , sorafenib , sunitinib , temsirolimus , axitinib , everolimus . A two week wash require last dose molecularly target therapy baseline correlative study ( 124IcG250 PET/CT bone marrow biopsy ) . If baseline correlative study perform , wash 1 week require prior commencement study therapy . Toxicities prior therapy must resolve grade 1 less prior start study therapy . Patients may treat surgery ( i.e. , cytoreductive nephrectomy require ) , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , cytokine therapy include interferon alpha interleukin2 . Patients treat brain spinalassociated metastasis eligible must conclude dexamethasone therapy consider neurologically stable . Age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less 1 ( Karnofsky great 70 % ) Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function The effect CRLX101 bevacizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal , barrier method , abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 month completion administration combination therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion administration combination therapy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients conventional chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study yet recover grade 1 less prior treatmentrelated adverse event . Patients major surgery within last 4 week . Prior treatment bevacizumab topoisomerase I therapy . Patients receive investigational therapeutic agent . History allergic reaction attribute experimental compound examine study . No active malignancy ( inactive / without progression least 6 month progression anticipate ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active serious infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History nonhealing wound ulcer . Pregnant nursing patient state . Agents examine clinical trial carry potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother study agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . Bevacizumab associate development treatmentrelated hypertension become urgent emergent . Evidence uncontrolled hypertension patient prior study enrollment preclude enrollment onto study blood pressure control . Uncontrolled hypertension define presence systolic blood pressure great equal 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great equal 100 mmHg measure two separate occasion . Patients know HIV solid organ transplant ( potential additional risk cytopenia ) .</criteria>
