	<brief_summary>Haemophilia disorder , usually genetic , affect mostly male individual , one proteins need form blood clot ( FVIII ) miss present sufficient level . In person haemophilia , clot process much slow person experience bleed episode result serious problem potential disability . The current haemophilia standard care maintain FVIII activity level 1 % . Sometimes , patient develop antibody ( call `` inhibitor '' ) FVIII longer effective control bleeds . Bleeds patient currently treat use protein involve clot process . The purpose study investigate effectively BAY86-6150 may stop acute bleeds `` inhibitor '' patient . This study consist two part , A B . The purpose part A find effective yet tolerable four dose BAY86-6150 regard efficacy safety ( dose-finding part ) . Part A expect last 9 - 29 month . The purpose part B confirm efficacy safety dose find part A participating patient ( confirmatory part ) . Part B expect last 12-32 month . Approximately 60 male subject 12 62 years-of-age moderate severe haemophilia A B , inhibitor FVIII FIX , 4 bleeding episode last 6 month , participate study . Patient 's bleeds treat BAY86-6150 rescue medication response make BAY86-6150 . Patients attend treatment centre regular interval require keep electronic diary .</brief_summary>
