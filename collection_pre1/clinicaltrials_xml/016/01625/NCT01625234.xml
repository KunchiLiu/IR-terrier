	<brief_summary>This first human study use X-396 ( ensartinib ) , drug develop treatment advanced cancer . The initial purpose study determine large amount X-396 safely give human ( maximum tolerate dose ) . Once recommended Phase 2 dose determine , expansion phase assess preliminary anti-tumor activity X-396 ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer . The study also provide early information body handle drug ( pharmacokinetics ) efficacy X-396 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study X-396 , Oral ALK Inhibitor , Patients With ALK-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first study X-396 ( ensartinib ) humans investigational drug give twice daily oral dose 28 day cycle disease progression unacceptable safety issue . X-396 give small group patient ( 1 - 6 ) dose level patient observe see adverse safety effect . As long unacceptable safety issue 28 day , dose X-396 increase next group patient . This process continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) X-396 reach . Once MTD reach , 60 additional patient also give X-396 determine activity X-396 patient ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer . These additional patient enrol follow 5 expansion cohort : ALK TKI-naïve patient , patient progress crizotinib , patient progress one 2nd generation ALK TKIs ( patient may may also receive prior crizotinib ) , patient asymptomatic CNS metastasis , patient leptomeningeal disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor malignancy . Patients may receive prior crizotinib and/or second generation ALK TKIs ( patient must progress alectinib ) . For expanded cohort portion study , patient must NSCLC ALK genomic alteration positive FISH IHC test do centrally ; however , patient allow enroll base local ALK FISH IHC result . 2 . Eastern Cooperative Group ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 1 . 3 . Ability swallow retain oral medication . 4 . Adequate organ system function . 5 . Patients treat untreated asymptomatic CNS metastasis may allow enroll . 6 . Male patient willing use adequate contraceptive measure . 7 . Female patient childbearing potential , female patient childbearing potential agree use adequate contraceptive measure . 8 . Patients must ≥ 18 year age . 9 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease dose escalation portion study measurable disease expand cohort portion study ( except patient CNS metastasis leptomeningeal cohort ) . 10 . Patients enter study ask provide tissue correlative testing ( available ) . 11 . Willingness ability comply trial followup procedure . 12 . Ability understand nature trial give write informed consent . 1 . Patients currently receive cancer therapy . 2 . Use investigational drug within 21 day 5 halflives ( whichever short ) prior first dose X396 . 3 . Any major surgery , radiotherapy , immunotherapy within last 21 day . Chemotherapy regimens delay toxicity within last 4 week . Chemotherapy regimens give continuously weekly basis limit potential delayed toxicity within last 2 week . 4 . Prior stem cell transplant . 5 . Patients know allergy delay hypersensitivity reaction drug chemically relate X396 ( e.g. , crizotinib ) active ingredient X396 . 6 . Patients primary CNS tumor ineligible . 7 . Concomitant use herbal medication least 7 day prior first dose study drug throughout participation trial . 8 . Females pregnant breastfeeding . 9 . Presence active gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease condition interfere significantly absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion X396 . 10 . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease . 11 . Patients immunosuppressed ( include know HIV infection ) , serious active infection time treatment , know hepatitis C , serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . 12 . Psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit compliance protocol . 13 . Concurrent condition investigator 's opinion would jeopardize compliance protocol would impart excessive risk associate study participation would make inappropriate patient enrol . 14 . Inability unwillingness comply study and/or followup procedure outline protocol .</criteria>
