	<detailed_description>3 . Research Plan : . Specific Aims Hypothesis : In 2007 , expert committee , compose representative 16 major clinical organization ( include PI proposal ) , publish recommendation primary care office-based treatment childhood obesity . Seeking clinical cost-effectiveness , recommendation call stag treatment start low intensity , , unsuccessful , increase high frequency visit . The committee acknowledge stag approach `` evaluate . '' Recent review conclude treatment childhood obesity efficacious . However , study conduct highly control tertiary care research setting involve large number direct contact hour ( e.g . many ≥ 35 contact hour ) . Research evaluate translation encouraging finding real-world clinical setting lack . Specifically , little research assess ( 1 ) feasibility recruitment primary care clinic ( 2 ) whether low intensity treatment ( i.e . initial phase stag approach recommend expert committee ) benefit weight loss . - Aim # 1 : To assess feasibility recruit overweight obese child , age 4-8 year , large , urban pediatric primary care clinic , randomize either low-intensity treatment control group , re-measuring approximately 3-months date recruitment . Our hypothesis able recruit approximately 70 parent/child dyad re-measure 80 % 3-months . - Aim # 2 : To evaluate whether proportion child decrease BMI z-score 3-month period high randomly assign intervention group compare control group . - Our hypothesis intervention result large proportion child decrease BMI z-score 3-month period . Results Aims 1 2 used plan NIH proposal . If low intensity treatment proposal show trend toward improvement usual care , justify full scale , R01 trial test complete recommendation expert committee . If subject intervention group decrease BMI z-scores , small NIH trial would need test amend low-intensity treatment stage parent/child contact ( e.g . email , home visit , phone call ) .</detailed_description>
