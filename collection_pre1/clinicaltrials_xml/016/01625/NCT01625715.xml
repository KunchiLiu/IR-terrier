	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Effect Ketotifen Adverse Events Associated With Peanut Desensitization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development safe oral peanut challenge procedure permit patient severe life threaten allergic reaction , safely desensitize ability maintain peanut tolerance . The peanut desensitization procedure however associate unpleasant allergic side effect mainly gastrointestinal cutaneous manifestation . The use premedication drug may lessen side effect facilitate peanut desensitization procedure . Ketotifen fast act , noncompetitive , H1-receptor blocker ( antihistamine/inverse agonist ) also inhibit release mediator mast cell involve hypersensitivity reaction . The study enroll 6 ( 4 peanut treatment group , 2 control group ) child know history peanut allergy . The treated subject randomize 2:1 ratio either pre-treatment group ( final dose 2 mg bid ketotifen ) control group . All subject undergo one-day peanut desensitization protocol design enable subject tolerate 50 mg peanut flour ( initial escalation phase ) . After initial escalation day achieve 50 mg peanut flour , dose build-up occur every two week 44 week . Subjects ingest 50mg increased dos peanut flour home ( every day 2 week ) dose escalation . The target dose 8000 mg peanut flour . A maintenance dose give 4 week follow last ( high dose ) visit .</detailed_description>
