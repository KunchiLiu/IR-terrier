	<brief_summary>This phase I study design determine feasibility transplantation use novel transplant approach employ two-stage haploidentical cell infusion follow myeloablative conditioning . This strategy , include selective depletion na√Øve T cell , may speed immune reconstitution thereby potentially reduce limitation traditional haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) increase potential therapeutic application . Additionally , investigator intend explore overall survival , event-free survival , hematopoietic cell recovery engraftment well infection rate complication patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CD45RA+ Depleted Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation Children With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve participant 12 donor enrol study . Donors undergo seven day hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) mobilization follow two apheresis collection . Each apheresis collection process CliniMACS system . DONORS : A mobilization regimen granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) use obtain peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) product donor . Apheresis perform minimum two consecutive day , include one day cell product deliver . STUDY PARTICIPANTS : Participants undergo two-stage haploidentical cell infusion follow myeloablative conditioning . The first cell infusion CD3-depleted product second infusion CD45RA-depleted product . Primary Objective : - To determine feasibility haploidentical HSCT use two infusion engineer negative selection Miltenyi CliniMACS system- first selective depletion CD3+ cell , follow second deplete CD45RA+ cell , child relapse refractory solid tumor lymphomas . Secondary Objectives : - To estimate hematopoietic cell recovery engraftment rate patient . - To estimate infection rate complication . - To estimate one-year overall survival ( OS ) event-free survival ( EFS ) study patient .</detailed_description>
