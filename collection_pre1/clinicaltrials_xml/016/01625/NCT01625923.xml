	<brief_summary>Gastroparesis disorder characterize impaired gastric empty absence obstruction proximal GI tract . It common condition affect 5 million person United States alone . Despite , metoclopramide currently FDA approve medication treatment gastroparesis . However , evidence support metoclopramide gastroparesis fairly weak recently issue black box warn potential irreversible side effect . There clearly urgent need new therapeutic option well efficacy tolerability . Olanzapine second generation anti-psychotic currently FDA approve treatment schizophrenia bipolar disorder . Because action several receptor throughout body , include dopamine serotonin receptor , Olanzapine may provide anti-nausea pro-motility effect stomach . Long-term use olanzapine may also increase plasma level ghrelin . Ghrelin hormone produce gut stimulates appetite also show beneficial effect gastroparesis . The investigator hypothesize olanzapine effective safe controlling symptom well stimulate appetite weight gain gastroparesis . The investigator also hypothesize olanzapine stimulate gastric motility . Finally , investigator hypothesize olanzapine modulate secretion ghrelin gastroparesis . This pilot study may provide information efficacy safety olanzapine gastroparesis could utilize large randomize , prospective study future .</brief_summary>
