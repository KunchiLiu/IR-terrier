	<detailed_description>Background The concept venous retroperfusion coronary artery disease Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause morbidity mortality industrialize country despite advance medical , interventional , surgical revascularization therapy . The different strategy aim restoration coronary blood flow subsequent improvement myocardial perfusion lead increased survival rate CAD patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) chronic stable disease . However , situation standard therapeutic approach may fail restore tissue perfusion : First , 20 % patient chronic CAD may amenable standard revascularization therapy may suffer refractory angina pectoris and/or chronic heart failure . Second , despite high success rate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) restoration coronary artery patency follow acute vessel occlusion ( AMI ) , blood flow infarct related artery often still markedly impaired ( TIMIâ‰¤2 ; no-reflow phenomenon , microvascular obstruction ) . As consequence , long pursue strategy augment myocardial perfusion divert blood coronary venous system ischemic region ( venous retroperfusion ) gain attention recent year . Already 1898 , experimental work Pratt suggest venous retroperfusion may provide nutritional delivery myocardium . In mid 20ieth century , concept follow cardiac surgeon introduce coronary venous bypass graft myocardial revascularization ( CVBG ; soon replace arterial counterpart , CABG ) also use protection technique valve surgery . More 25 year ago , occlusion coronary sinus ( CSO ) introduce provide retroperfusion transient augmentation coronary venous pressure . Since , different device use CSO invent evaluate animal model small clinical trial , e.g . intermittent CSO ( ICSO ) pressure-controlled intermittent CSO ( PICSO ; Miracor Medical Systems , Austria ) well coronary sinus reducer stent ( Neovasc Medical , Israel ) . At least system use ( P ) ICSO seem effective myocardial salvage ; however , yet employ clinical routine , possibly due difficult usage potential risk ( sinus damage , thrombosis , stenosis , chronic myocardial edema ) . Importantly , exact underlie mechanisms retroperfusion due CSO may reduce myocardial ischemia yet understood . It propose aside augment delivery blood ischemic region , follow mechanism may play role : functional venous microcirculation , less blockade microcirculation , `` washout '' reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , diminish granulocyte trapping , improvement cellular/interstitial edema . Importantly , likely extent coronary collateral play crucial role efficacy ( P ) ICSO . However , limited number experimental study address issue far . Coronary collateral circulation As `` natural bypass '' , coronary collateral anastomosis without intervene capillary bed portion coronary artery different coronary artery represent alternative source blood supply myocardial area jeopardize ischemia . In patient CAD , well-developed coronary collateral circulation contributes reduction infarct size , LV-dysfunction , mortality . Collaterals heart assess quantitatively coronary flow velocity pressure measurement , become gold standard . The theoretical basis method relate fact perfusion pressure ( minus central venous `` back '' pressure ) flow velocity signal obtain distal occluded stenosis originate collateral . The measurement aortic coronary pressure flow velocity provide basis calculation pressure- velocity-derived collateral flow index ( CFI ) , express amount flow via collateral vascular region interest fraction flow via normally patent vessel CFI measurement document accurate regard ECG derive dichotomous collateral assessment , regard , also quantitative myocardial perfusion image contrast echocardiography balloon occlusion . Pressure- Doppler-derived coronary collateral measurement regard reference method quantitative clinical assessment coronary collateral flow . Pressure- Doppler-derived coronary collateral measurement regard reference method quantitative clinical assessment coronary collateral flow . As consequence , imagine origin preform collateral channel non-ischemic area , blood diverge away downstream microcirculation due regionally augment back pressure . At orifice preform collateral , perfusion pressure well back pressure low result low driving pressure , i.e. , necessary condition receive blood collateral-supplying region ( limited increase wall stress , respectively extravascular tissue pressure approximately 27 mmHg ) . These theoretical consideration investigate experimentally far . Sato et al . perform regional myocardial blood flow measurement dogs ligation leave anterior descend coronary artery ( LAD ) without coronary sinus pressure elevation 30 mmHg . In study , regional myocardial blood flow collateralize area augment elevation coronary sinus pressure , however effect present periphery ischemic region . Using similar model ( namely LAD occlusion dog sinus pressure augmentation 30 mmHg CSO ) , Ido et al . show CSO augments subendocardial subepicardial myocardial blood flow ischemic region ( i.e . collateral flow ) . Interestingly , CSO also normalize subepicardial blood flow non-ischemic region , increase LAD occlusion . Moreover , maximal vasodilation adenosine effect abolish blood flow CSO decrease ischemic region , indicate collateral steal.17 In addition study , Toggart et al . demonstrate year earlier pig model ICSO ( augmentation 60 mmHg ) increase pressure distal occlude LAD , improve blood flow leave ventricular function . Since pig preform collateral , study importantly indicate crucial role collateral flow therapeutic efficacy ICSO . Of note , result study also argue propose `` washout '' hypothesis . In conclusion , experimental study pathophysiologic consideration suggest necessary role collateral circulation beneficial effect coronary sinus occlusion observe animal human ; however , clinical data available far effect CSO myocardial ischemia presence vary collateral flow .
