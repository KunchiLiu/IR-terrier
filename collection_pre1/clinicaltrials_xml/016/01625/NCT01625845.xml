	<brief_summary>The objective clinical trial evaluate whether anti-inflammatory medication , pentoxifylline , reduces depressive symptom improves artery function . Participants trial old primary care patient ( 60 year ) depress history cardiovascular disease . Half patient receive pentoxifylline , half receive placebo . In addition , participant arm receive evidence-based psychological treatment call Beating Blues® , computerize , cognitive behavioral treatment program depression . The investigator use questionnaire assess change depressive symptom ultrasound test measure change artery function pre- post-treatment . It hypothesize patient receive pentoxifylline show great improvement depression artery function patient receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death , depression lead cause disability United States . Previous research suggest systemic inflammation may play important role development depression cardiovascular disease . Therefore , Aim # 1 study examine whether add anti-inflammatory medication ( pentoxifylline ) standard depression treatment ( cognitive-behavioral therapy ) improve depressive symptom endothelial dysfunction , sign early cardiovascular disease . Aim # 2 evaluate candidate mediator treatment effect examine whether reduction multiple marker systemic inflammation account treatment-related improvement depressive symptom endothelial dysfunction . To achieve aim , clinical trial older depress primary care patient free cardiovascular disease conduct . Patients randomize one two group : standard depression treatment ( cognitive-behavioral treatment program ) plus pentoxifylline standard depression treatment plus placebo . The treatment phase study 12 week . At baseline , 6 week , 12 week , patient undergo assessment depressive symptom , various inflammatory marker , endothelial function . Our index endothelial function brachial artery flow-mediated dilation , noninvasive measure endothelial function . Demonstrating medication target systemic inflammation effective concurrently treat late-life depression reduce CAD risk would place anti-inflammatory approach collection depression treatment strategy , well CAD prevention strategy , primary care provider . This change clinical practice result improve management late-life depression cardiovascular risk , turn would reduce disability , CAD morbidity , mortality among old adult .</detailed_description>
