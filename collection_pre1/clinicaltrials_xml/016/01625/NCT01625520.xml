	<brief_title>SOM230 Alone Combination With RAD001 Patients With Medullary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) neuroendocrine tumor originate thyroid C cell . Neuroendocrine tumor demonstrate express somatostatin receptor well mTOR pathway . The somatostatin analogues available ( octreotide lanreotide ) act preferentially somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( sst2 ) . In MTC , compound report exert anti-secretive effect calcitonin anti-proliferative effects.SOM230 ( pasireotide ) new somatostatin analogue show peculiar bind profile high affinity sst1 , sst2 , sst3 , sst5 . Preliminary data show SOM230 effective phase II study patient metastatic carcinoid . RAD001 ( everolimus ) novel agent interacts mTOR . It demonstrate inhibit tumor growth neuroendocrine tumor cell line . Some clinical trial explore efficacy combine therapy RAD001 plus octreotide patient digestive neuroendocrine tumor , highlight encouraging result term tumor control.In particular , octreotide RAD001 seem show synergistic activity inhibit neuroendocrine tumor proliferation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients progressive metastatic postoperative persistent medullary thyroid cancer histopathologically confirm disease measurable tumor lesion . ( Postoperative persistent surgical removal characterize increased level calcitonin without radiological detectable tumour relapse metastasis . ) Patients evidence biochemical progression disease , express progressive increase serum calcitonin level , assess month least three month study entry , accord RECIST definition ( elevation marker least 25 % ) . Disease amenable surgery , radiation , combine modality therapy curative intent . Adequate organ function KarnofskyIndex performance status &gt; 60 % Life expectancy &gt; 6 month Age &gt; 18 year Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day randomization urine pregnancy test 48 hour prior administration first study treatment . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrolment . Unstable systemic disease include uncontrolled hypertension , active uncontrolled infection , psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Known hypersensitivity somatostatin analogue . Pregnant breastfeeding patient Sign recurrence prior concomitant malignancy ( within last 3 year require active treatment ) MTC ; exception previous basal cell skin cancer , previous cervical carcinoma situ Prior therapy mTOR inhibitor ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) Participation clinical trial test investigational drug within 4 week prior visit 1 . Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition : Patients congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant bradycardia , advanced heart block history acute myocardial infarction within six month precede enrollment , QT relate exclusion criterion Previous treatment chemotherapy , loco regional therapy ( eg , chemoembolization ) interferon permit provide toxicity resolve &lt; Grade 1 study entry last treatment least 4 week prior baseline assessment .</criteria>
