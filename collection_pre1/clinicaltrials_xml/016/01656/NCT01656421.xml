	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) increase risk cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , muscle waste diabetes mellitus . Cardiovascular disease major cause death patient may relate excess stiffen wall major artery , aorta , suggest represent premature age . However , little known development problem , previously consider due smoke known factor . The investigator study large group patient mild severe airflow obstruction base NICE 2010 classification severity match comparator group free COPD . This study involve three assessment development complication COPD five year period . The key measure rate change aortic wall stiffness , accept indicator risk heart disease . Changes wall stiffness relate severity lung disease; know cardiovascular risk factor , high blood pressure , increase blood cholesterol cardiovascular event include heart attack death; presence complication , osteoporosis , muscle waste diabetes mellitus . These measure analyse context change bodywide inflammation metabolic function change rate ageing . This increase knowledge interacting factor complication COPD likely lead study treatment avoid development .</brief_summary>
