	<brief_summary>Beta blocker type medication mainly use heart disease . They commonly use treat 'angina ' prevent heart attack . Patients COPD likely suffer heart disease already benefit treatment reason . In addition , new research suggest may benefit use beta blocker COPD , even without also heart disease . The reason beta blocker widely use COPD present potential make symptom COPD bad causing airway narrow . Beta blocker opposite type medication 'beta-agonists ' salbutamol may take symptom breathlessness wheeze . Nevertheless beta blocker still use COPD benefit ( example heart disease ) outweigh risk . Current COPD treatment include inhaled steroid long act beta agonist , often give combination inhaler ( e.g . Seretide Symbicort ) treat airway inflammation airway narrowing , leading improvement symptom . Another drug commonly use Tiotropium ( Spiriva ) another type long act inhaler medication help widening airway . In study , wish find two different type beta blocker cause different effect airway COPD patient . One type beta blocker 'selective ' act mainly heart , type general 'non-selective ' effect heart lung . By also able look beta blocker work alongside 'usual ' inhaler treatment describe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Visit A member research team discuss Patient Information Sheet participant , answer question pose write informed consent obtain . Prior screen participant ask withhold tiotropium 48 hour ipratropium bromide 12 hour salbutamol 6 hour . A general physical examination carry qualified medical practitioner . A pregnancy test urine sample perform female participant advice issue male female participant use contraception throughout duration study . The following measured : Spirometry sequential reversibility 400μg salbutamol 80 μg ipratropium bromide accord American Thoracic Society guideline Resting Electrocardiogram Whole body plethysmography ( possible ) Impulse Oscillometry Oxygen saturation breathe room air 5 min rest Heart rate blood pressure . 6 Minute Walk Test ( physically able ) Inhaler technique assess confirmed adequate . Full blood count , renal function , electrolytes , liver enzymes random blood glucose measure . Participants check inclusion exclusion criterion . Those find eligible proceed run-in period . Run-in period Participants take inhaled corticosteroid , combination inhaler , Long act bata agonist long-acting anti-muscarinics discontinue . All participant enter run-in period commence Fostair ( Beclometasone/Formoterol ) 100/6 , 2 puff twice daily via spacer device approximately 2 week . Participants give PiKO monitor record domiciliary Forced expiratory volume1 Forced expiratory Volume6 twice daily ( approximately 12 hour apart ) diary supply department well domiciliary oxygen saturation Heart Rate monitor record twice daily . They also complete daily diary reliever use symptom . These perform begin run-in period end study . At end run-in , participant check inclusion exclusion criterion hief Investigator medical investigator study sign declaration Case Report Form , confirm subject 's suitability receive study drug accord study protocol . Those eligible proceed study visit 1 . Those fulfil study criterion return pre-study medication GP inform medically relevant data . Study Visit 1 ( Baseline 1 ) Participants attend department morning study visit . Participants ask withhold ipratropium 12 hour salbutamol 6 hour prior visit .

Participants allow complete treatment arm maximum tolerate dose beta-blocker , less maximum prescribed dose . Participants treatment arm continue take Fostair 100/6 , 2 puff bid via spacer device first 5 week treatment period . For final ( 6th ) week treatment period receive inhale beclometasone dipropionate ( Clenil ) 200μg , 2 puff bid via spacer device , instead Fostair . Participants treatment arm give Tiotropium 18μg ( via handihaler ) od first 4 week treatment period . Tiotropium discontinue final 2 week treatment period . Participants give salbutamol inhaler use initial reliever therapy along ipratropium inhaler second line PRN basis . The IMPs issue participant member research team delegate task .
