	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate pexacerfont , orally available , brain-penetrant selective CRF1 antagonist , ability modulate food crave consumption chronic unsuccessful dieter . Study population : We collect evaluable data 90 restrain eater ( individual indicate history chronic yo-yo diet score 15 high Dietary Restraint Scale ) . To ensure participant degree preoccupation food , additional inclusion criterion endorsement Restraint Scale item Do give much time think food ? Apart preoccupation food , participant healthy . They either normal-weight overweight ( Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 22kg/m2 ) ; stratify across dose group . Frank eat disorder exclusionary . Design : This randomize , double-blind , between-groups study two group . Participants stabilize either pexacerfont placebo 28 day ( 300 mg/day load dose 7 day , follow 100 mg/day maintenance dose 21 day ) . On day 15 , undergo math-test stressor stress-induced food consumption crave assess bogus taste test visual-analog scale . During three subsequent visit day 16 28 , expose three personalize imagery-induction scripts-one stress-related , one food-related , one neutral/relaxing . Food crave food consumption assess visit well . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure stress-induced eating math-test stressor . Other outcome measure include spontaneous food consumption stressor , subjective rating stress , mood , food craving , autonomic response ( galvanic skin response ( GSR ) , heart rate , blood pressure ) , endocrine response ( salivary cortisol , salivary alpha-amylase , serum cortisol ) .</detailed_description>
