	<detailed_description>A total 50 outpatient receive chronic oral corticosteroid therapy enrol 52-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial memantine . Participant receive either memantine placebo 24 week . They equal chance receive memantine placebo . After 24 week discontinue study medication 4 week . This process repeat one additional time study participant crossed-over either memantine placebo , whichever participant receive , take placebo memantine one course . Randomization stratify prednisone dose &lt; 20 mg/day vs. ≥ 20 mg/day . Memantine placebo start 5 milligram day , increase 5 milligram twice day ( 10 total ) week 2 , 15 milligram total week 3 , 20 milligram total week 4-24 unless side effect require study doctor increase initial dos slower describe reduce dose . This process repeat week 28 participant completely study medication 4 week . Structural MRI 1HMRS obtain baseline week 24 52 ( memantine placebo ) . The clinician version structure Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) brief structure interview major Axis I disorder DSM-IV include major depressive disorder , dysthymic disorder , bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder , anxiety disorder , eat disorder , alcohol substance abuse/dependence . This give baseline screen illnesses CNS involvement cognitive impairment . Blood draw perform baseline assess insulin fast glucose level . Each participant return follow-up appointment schedule repeat outcome measure . Pill count conduct , list current medication dos obtain visit . Participants compensate receive bus pass appointment , plus monetary incentive compliance . Participants evaluate RA PI follow-up appointment . The HVLT-R give baseline , week 12 , 24 , 28 , 40 , 52 ; primary outcome measure . Other cognitive assessment perform visit well .</detailed_description>

Illnesses associate CNS involvement ( e.g. , seizure , brain tumor , head injury loss consciousness ) cognitive impairment ( e.g. , substance dependence within past 2 year , bipolar disorder ) Potential participant mood symptom secondary corticosteroid ( base SCID ) exclude could selectively exclude subject sensitive CNS effect corticosteroid . Vulnerable population ( e.g . severe cognitive impairment , pregnant nursing woman , prisoner ) . Severe lifethreatening medical illness would make completion study unlikely Contraindications memantine therapy ( e.g . severe side effect past ) Danger self others define &gt; 1 lifetime suicide attempt assault , suicide attempt assault within past year , active suicidal homicidal ideation plan intent .
