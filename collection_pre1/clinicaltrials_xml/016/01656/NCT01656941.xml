	<detailed_description>For physician care child congenital cardiac defect , perhaps great challenge improve survival functional outcome patient severe defect require surgical repair palliation first month life . These cardiac defect associate 5 year mortality rate 30 % significant disability many survivor . As every medical condition , patient outcome depend complex interaction disease process , medical surgical intervention treat disease , inherent capacity patient respond disease treatment . For patient severe cardiac defect , great risk morbidity mortality occur shortly neonatal surgical repair . During surgery repair severe cardiac defect , body cool heart stopped . In many case , blood flow vital organ interrupt restricted significant period time aortic arch reconstruct . This process place profound stress patient 's capacity tolerate insult without sustain irreversible injury tissue heart , brain , kidney . That wide range outcome surgery , even patient similar clinical feature , suggest important individual difference patient ' ability respond stress determine difference genetic trait . The importance interaction control trauma surgical environment patient 's genetic background determine patient outcome lead new discipline `` peri-operative genomics . '' In study , examine contribution gene-environment interaction perioperative short-term outcome neonate severe congenital cardiac defect .</detailed_description>
