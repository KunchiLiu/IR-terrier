	<detailed_description>The primary aim study examine safety administration unlicensed investigational NCBP HPC-CORD BLOOD product multi-institution setting . Therefore , study evaluate prospectively incidence serious adverse reaction well incidence infusion relate reaction administration unlicensed , investigational NCBP CBU . Definitions Infusion-related adverse reaction : Mild - Moderate : reaction infusion CB product require medical intervention affect overall patient status outcome . Severe : serious , life-threatening fatal infusion reaction , require major medical intervention . These include : anaphylactic shock , acute cardiac , pulmonary renal failure , seizure , patient transfer Intensive Care Unit , death within 48 hour CB infusion . Adverse Reactions also classify grade , accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAE ) .</detailed_description>
