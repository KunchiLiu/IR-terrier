	<brief_title>The Effects Mirror Therapy Upper Extremity Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>55 % 75 % people stroke paretic arm cause motor impairment . Among novel rehabilitation intervention , MT find beneficial comparatively low-cost . MT reduce motor impairment possibly part recruit premotor cortex balance neural activation within primary motor cortex toward affect hemisphere . However , benefit certain aspect outcomes debate . Another treatment , MG , use normalize muscle tone , suppress muscle spasticity , enhance residual volitional activity hand arm , even increase walk speed . In addition , provide MG stimulation might result plastic change primary motor cortex , induce long-lasting modulated effect motor cortical excitability . The possible mechanism brain plasticity underlie MG collective mechanism behind MT . Adding MG MT might augment cortical reorganization . In sum , combine MT MG may supplement disadvantage uncertain effect MT broaden benefit outcome .</detailed_description>
