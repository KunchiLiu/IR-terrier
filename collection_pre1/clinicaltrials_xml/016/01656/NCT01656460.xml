	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Consolidation After Standard Chemoradiation Stage 3 Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol investigate potential role SBRT patient stage 3 NSCLC . Eligible patient first receive standard 50.4 Gy chemoradiation . Patients enter study opportunity receive SBRT noninvasive option compare surgical resection . For patient surgical candidate , SBRT 50.4 Gy chemoradiation represent technique radiation consolidation may effective less toxic standard conventional fractionate radiation</detailed_description>
