	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate negative-pressure dressing place surgical incision reduce risk develop surgical site infection compare commonly-used sterile gauze incision dress . In study , negative-pressure dressing compare standard post-surgical sterile gauze dress . In study patient either receive negative-pressure dress standard sterile gauze dress</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Therapy Preventing Infection After Surgery Patients With Colon , Rectal , Pancreatic , Peritoneal Surface Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether negative pressure therapy apply closed laparotomy incision decrease incidence incisional surgical site infection patient undergo clean-contaminated resection colorectal , pancreatic , peritoneal surface malignancy compare standard post-operative sterile gauze dressing . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive standard sterile dressing ( SSD ) close laparotomy incision conclusion surgery . ARM II : Patients receive negative pressure therapy ( NPT ) dress closed laparotomy incision conclusion surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
