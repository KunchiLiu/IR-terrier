	<brief_summary>Patients Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) complete remission receive eltrombopag undergoing consolidation chemotherapy high-dose cytarabine . Eltrombopag may help increase number platelet chemotherapy may help prevent risk bleeding . Phase I study side effect , best dose platelet effect eltrombopag give consolidation chemotherapy . After maximum safe tolerate dose schedule find Phase I , study proceed Phase II . Phase II confirm dose schedule eltrombopag identify Phase I increase platelet count patient receive consolidation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Eltrombopag During Consolidation Therapy Adults With AML Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consolidation chemotherapy high dose cytarabine usually cause myelosuppression 14 21 day treatment . Patients low blood count day week bone marrow resume function . This may result e.g. , hospitalization , treatment antibiotic , transfusion blood and/or platelet . In addition , may cause delay treatment reduction dose . To achieve best outcome treatment , dose reduction delay treatment must avoid . The incidence duration decrease white blood cell ( neutropenia ) neutropenic complication reduce use growth colony stimulate factor . Additionally , use erythropoietin-stimulating factor reduce anemia need red blood cell transfusion . Thrombocytopenia remain important limit factor administration chemotherapy maintain dose intensity patient . Additionally , risk bleed secondary low platelet count may increase sickness even death patient undergoing cancer treatment . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) principal cytokine involve regulation megakaryopoiesis platelet production . Eltrombopag orally bioavailable , small molecule , TPO-receptor agonist stimulates platelet production similar , identical , mechanism endogenous TPO . Eltrombopag approve U.S. treatment chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura . Eltrombopag also development indication Hepatitis C Virus-associated thrombocytopenia , Myelodysplastic Syndrome/AML , oncology relate thrombocytopenias . This agent appear possess many desirable property treatment chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia , include oral administration . The Phase I portion study conduct use dose escalation/de-escalation strategy patient either first second complete remission . Dose escalation plan form acceleration date initiation eltrombopag relative start consolidation chemotherapy well increase daily dose . The Phase II portion conduct use dose schedule select Phase I portion study patient first complete remission . Patients used control , e.g. , two-period two-treatment cross-over design . Patients randomly allocate 1:1 one two sequence . Patients randomize Sequence A receive eltrombopag first cycle consolidation placebo Cycle 2 . Patients randomize Sequence B receive placebo first cycle consolidation eltrombopag Cycle 2 . The treatment assignment blind patient study/sponsor personnel . Patients undergo blood sample collection Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) / Erythropoietin ( EPO ) pharmacokinetic analysis eltrombopag Phase I pharmacokinetic analysis eltrombopag Phase II portion study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Cytomorphologically document diagnosis acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Acute promyelocytic leukemia patient exclude ( FAB M3 ) . FAB classification , cytogenetics molecular marker ( applicable ) must available registration . Phase I Enrollment : Must first second complete remission , e.g. , evidence active disease blood , bone marrow ( &lt; 5 % blast ) , tissue . For remission , may receive 2 cycle induction treatment ( type ) . May receive one course consolidation current remission prior enrollment ( type ) Phase II Enrollment : Must first complete remission , e.g. , evidence active disease blood , bone marrow ( &lt; 5 % blast ) , tissue . May receive 2 cycle induction treatment ( type ) . Enrollment Either Phase : Remission status must document bone marrow examination 28 day prior study registration . Have recover induction first consolidation ( applicable ) therapy side effect ( ≤grade 1 ) . ≥18 year age ≤70 year age . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Have receive cytotoxic drug therapy within 21 day registration . Have receive hematopoietic colony stimulate growth factor within 14 day registration . Have receive pack red blood cell platelet within 7 day registration . Have receive investigational agent within 30 day registration receive investigational agent eltrombopag/placebo study . Signed IRBapproved informed consent . Willing provide blood sample research purpose . Adequate organ function obtain within 28 day prior registration : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1 x 10⁹/L Platelet count &gt; 100 x 10⁹/L Total direct serum bilirubin ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ALT AST ≤3x ULN BUN serum creatinine &lt; 2x ULN Albumin ≥2.5 g/dL PT PTT 80120 % institutional normal range Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day registration . Not pregnant breast feeding . Women childbearing potential sexually active male must use accepted effective method contraception . Patients know East Asian ancestry ( Chinese , Japanese , Taiwanese , Korean ) exclude protocol participation safety efficacy reason . Able swallow retain orally administer medication . No clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . No clinical evidence hepatomegaly splenomegaly . No know risk Torsades de Pointes . ( Eltrombopag use show associated Torsades de Pointes . ) No active unresolved infection must antibiotics least 7 day prior registration . No current evidence invasive fungal infection . No known Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C active disease . No known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) seropositivity . The risk potential toxicity secondary HIV ( e.g. , increased risk fatal opportunistic infection ) may confound toxicity profile eltrombopag . Patients history Central Nervous System ( CNS ) leukemia eligible documentation current CNS involvement cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) examination ( e.g. , negative CSF lumbar puncture ) within 28 day registration . No prior concomitant malignancy past 5 year currently active likely interfere patient 's treatment AML likely increase patient 's morbidity mortality . No prior chemotherapy radiation therapy allow ( unless relate AML treatment ) . No concurrent organ damage medical problem would prohibit therapy .</criteria>
