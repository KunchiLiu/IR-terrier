	<brief_summary>Background : - Long-term survival human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) well understood . Adults infect HIV child live virus many year . However , effect HIV group people study depth . Researchers interested study HIV infection medicine use treat affect people infect early life . They want find problem HIV-infected child grow develop adult , especially developed heart problem . As part study , people HIV compare healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To study effect HIV infection treatment people acquire HIV infection early life . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age infect HIV age 10 . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age history heart disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They regular study visit year 10 year collect health information . - Blood urine sample collect look kidney liver function . - X-ray scan use look bone density amount fat muscle body . - Heart function test image study , include ultrasound echocardiogram , use look closely heart . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) alter natural history HIV disease child . - Longterm survivor pediatric HIV infection offer tremendous opportunity understand effect HIV ART health outcome . - A thorough understanding impact HIV ART long-term process extremely relevant ART program HIV-infected child expand globally . Objective : - To explore clinical outcome impact HIV infection ART cohort HIV infection acquire early life . Eligibility : - Individuals great 18 yrs age acquire HIV infection early life . - Individuals previously enrol Protocol 07-C-0087 ( A natural history study HIV acquire infancy childhood ) offer enrollment study . - Healthy volunteer without HIV ( &gt; 18 year age ) serve control group . Design : - Annual evaluation health status , immune function health parameter relate HIV infection conduct . In addition , subset participant complete detailed cardiac evaluation imaging may repeat every 5 year .</detailed_description>
