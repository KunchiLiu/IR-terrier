	<detailed_description>Ten panel ( Panels A-J ) , consist 103 participant total , randomize receive either MK-8150 matching placebo . Males ( 18 55 year age , inclusive ) mild moderate hypertension randomize Panels A-D receive either MK-8150 placebo daily treatment 10 consecutive day . Elderly male female ( 65 80 year age , inclusive ) mild moderate hypertension include Panels E F receive single dose either MK-8150 placebo Study Day 1 follow least 5 day wash-out proceed daily treatment randomize treatment low dose 10 consecutive day . Participants 18 65 year age resistant hypertension enrol Panels H receive randomize sequence MK-8150/placebo placebo/MK-8150 2 treatment period . There minimum 3 week washout period 2 treatment period Panel H. Healthy male ( 18 55 year age , inclusive ) enrol Panel G receive MK-8150 match placebo daily 28 day . Participants randomize MK-8150 Panel G meet dose-escalation criterion meet hemodynamic stopping criterion eligible dose increase Day 8 , Day 15 , Day 22 . If dose escalation criterion meet ( Investigator Sponsor elect increase dose ) , participant continue current dose eligible dose increase next dose-escalation decision day dose-escalation criterion meet time . Male participant ( 18 65 year age , inclusive ) mild moderate hypertension randomize Panels I J . In panel , 18 participant receive either MK-8150 matching placebo daily treatment 28 consecutive day . Participants randomize placebo receive placebo throughout study . On Days 8 , 15 22 Panels I J , participant eligible dose-escalation , down-dosing , continue current dose depend hemodynamic status . Participants Panels I J meet down-dosing criterion time study dos reduce previous well-tolerated dose level next dose-escalation decision day , end study , whichever first .</detailed_description>
