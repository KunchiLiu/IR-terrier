	<brief_title>An MRI-guided Treatment Strategy Prevent Disease Progression Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory joint disease . Patients typically experience pain , functional impairment reduce quality life , risk develop progressive joint damage . The disease primarily affect small joint hand foot . The current treatment strategy involve early intensive treatment close clinical follow , attempt control disease avoid inflammation thereby prevent pain , improve functional level avoid joint damage . It therefore important optimal treatment RA patient method use diagnosis , disease monitor prognostication highly sensitive . Erosive joint damage occur early disease . Joint deformity irreversible cause serious functional impairment . Early intensive treatment close monitoring inflammation slow destructive disease prevent function loss . However , demonstrate patient show conventional clinical biochemical examination low disease activity remission still progressive joint damage . This demonstrate current clinical/biochemical method use daily clinical practice sufficiently sensitive method require monitoring disease activity prognostication . The presence erosion ( show X-ray examination ) well anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide ( anti-CCP ) antibodies bone marrow oedema ( osteitis ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , independent predictor subsequent radiographic progression . Bone marrow oedema show strong independent predictor early RA MRI therefore significant prognostic value . It therefore possible supplementing conventional clinical biochemical examination RA patient MRI , intensify treatment bone marrow oedema present , help reduce disease activity , avoid progressive joint damage prevent function loss . The current study therefore base follow hypothesis : By supplement conventional clinical biochemical examination RA patient low disease activity/in remission MRI intensify treatment case sub-clinical inflammation measure presence bone marrow oedema , possible prevent radiographic erosive progression , improve functional level enable patient achieve clinical remission .</detailed_description>
