	<brief_summary>Ex vivo LPS stimulation whole blood good alternative challenge induce inflammatory response examine difference inflammatory response healthy compromise subject . The purpose current study examine inflammatory response young population ( 35-45 yr old ) see whether population also differences ex vivo LPS induce cytokine response exist healthy compromised subject , see elderly subject . Overweight subject show state disturb blood glucose control include subject compromise health compare healthy lean subject age ( shift healthy towards unhealthy , diseased ) . Hypothesis Ex vivo LPS stimulation whole blood induce measurable inflammatory cytokine response healthy population different response compromise population . The investigator include subject age 35-45 year differ health characteristic , especially blood HbA1c , fat % waist circumference .</brief_summary>
