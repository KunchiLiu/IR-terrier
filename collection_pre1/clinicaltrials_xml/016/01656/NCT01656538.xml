	<criteria>Patients must histological/cytological diagnosis metastatic breast cancer . Patients must advance and/or metastatic disease , curative therapy exist systemic therapy indicate . All patient must available formalin fix paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) must provide informed consent release block , well CTC blood sample correlative study bank . For patient tissue biopsy within last 12 month , repeat biopsy strongly recommend mandate provide archival tissue available . • Rebiopsy recommend &gt; 1 year since last biopsy . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . The criterion define measurable disease follow : Chest xray ≥ 20mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5mm ) ≥10mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15mm &gt; measure short axis ECOG performance 0 , 1 2 . Age ≥ 18 year age Previous Therapy Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 21days prior patient randomization wound heal occur . Chemotherapy : Patients must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen advance metastatic disease unless : 1. relapse within 6 month completion adjuvant chemotherapy 2. receive taxane and/or anthracycline contain adjuvant chemotherapy . Palliative therapy breast cancer ( chemotherapy , target , hormonal ) permit three prior chemotherapy regimens permissible . Other Therapy : Patients may receive therapy include immunotherapy , signal transduction inhibitor . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy adequate washout prior chemotherapy , investigational agent follow : long one follow . two week standard cycle length prior regimen ( i.e 21 day doxorubicin q3 week ) 5 halflives investigational drug . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) ALT AST ≤ 3 x ULN ( Note : ≤ 5 x ULN document liver metastasis ) Proteinuria &lt; 2g/24hrs ( screen use spot testing ; ≥ grade 2 repeat midstream urine ; still ≥ grade 2 , urine collection 24 hour confirm &lt; 2g/24hrs ) . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . ( Please call NCIC CTG question interpretation criterion ) . Patients immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. Patients active uncontrolled infection serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients significant cardiac ( include uncontrolled hypertension ) pulmonary disease , active CNS disease infection . Patients eligible know hypersensitivity study drug ( ) component . Patients history central nervous system metastasis untreated spinal cord compression . Patients contraindication treatment paclitaxel and/or neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use two reliable form contraception study 6 month discontinue therapy . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take proven negative within 7 day prior randomization must lactate . Men must surgically sterile use barrier method contraception .
