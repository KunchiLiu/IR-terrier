	<brief_summary>TITLE Randomised Control Trial ( RCT ) improve functional outcome stroke renal disease patient DESIGN Eandomised Conrol Study AIMS 1 . Undertake detailed characterisation stroke ( include recently develop image technique Imperial ) stroke renal disease patient include clinical , image epidemiological data 2 . To Investigate passive intervention use hand grip device dialysis session improve functional outcome stroke end stage renal disease patient . OUTCOME MEASURES 1 . Primary outcome : . 3 month change Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer score . 2 . Secondary outcome : 3 month change NIHS &amp; Bartel score POPULATION Ischaemic haemorrhagic stroke patient renal disease treat Hammersmith 's Hospital 's renal Unit . . ELIGIBILITY Data patient renal disease image proven stroke retrospectively analyse . RCT conduct End Stage Renal Disease patient acute ( &lt; 7 day ) stroke affect arm . DURATION 2 year</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomised Control Trial . ESRD patient dialysis suffer acute ( &lt; 7 day ) stroke ( ischaemic/haemorrhagic ) predict bad likely outcome ( see ) recruit RCT . Stroke patient randomly assign intervention ( 60 patient ) standard treatment ( 60 patient ) arm ( power calculation ) . Patients detailed demographic information document . In addition , type , frequency length time dialysis note . Pre-/post- Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer score undertake ( sensitive measure arm motor function ) . 60 patient randomly allocate visual-feedback handgrip ( affected arm ) exercise develop in-house ( use Current Designs hand-grip force transducer , E-Prime software ) . Subjects allocate treatment trained laptop-based exercise take 20 minutes/session . Subjects encourage perform exercise 2-3 time per dialysis session depend upon mood , although permit skip session feel well motivate . The laptop program time-stamps session , record time-series duration , force accuracy hand grip . Non-intervention . 60 similar ESRD stroke patient randomly assign non-intervention arm . These patient receive standard advice dialysis ( rest gentle activity , e.g . reading ) . Note group patient also receive standard multidisciplinary rehabilitation care follow stroke , include therapy session time receive dialysis 3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome . 3 month change Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer score . Secondary outcome : 3 month change NIHS &amp; Bartel score - PARTICIPANT ENTRY 4.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS We recruit patient , suffer image proven , acute stroke affect arm , undergoing maintenance haemodialysis Imperial College NHS Trust well retrospectively analyse data patient renal disease stroke treat Hammersmith Hospital 4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients image proven , acute ( &lt; 7days ) stroke affect arm , maintenance dialysis recruit RCT . Patients able consent study either writing , verbally nonverbally presence witness . We retrospectively analyse database renal disease patient stroke . This data collect Hammersmith Hospital 's Renal Team . In case non-English speaking patient use Hospital 's interpreter 's service explain study patient , obtain consent train use device . . 4.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients unwilling give consent , patient unable use hand grip tool due severe hand weakness ( MRC 0/5 ) , patient unable understand English native language due receptive aphasia , dementia . Patients arteriovenous fistula affected arm exclude trial 4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Patients unwilling participate study . Patients , lose capacity consent study . Patient experience side effect . In case data collect used final analysis new data collect .</detailed_description>
