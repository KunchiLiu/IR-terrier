	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Intracranially Implanted Carmustine Treat Newly Diagnosed Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma recur mostly 2 cm within originated area . Local therapy therefore become particular important . Gliadel wafer develop States market developed country example treatment . The product study , Carmustine Sustained Release Implant ( CASANT ) , similar Gliadel wafer API ( Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient ) , different drug delivering system . As require , preliminary clinical study conduct China . Based result phase I/II , 8-10 wafer contain give dose BCNU administer intracranially phase III tumor resect cavity investigate safety efficacy treatment primary malignant glioma 236 patient .</detailed_description>
