	<brief_title>68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT Evaluation Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Integrin αvβ3 important member receptor family express preferentially regenerative vascular endothelial cell , low quiescent vessel cell normal cell . The αvβ3 integrin key mediator angiogenesis thus may important diagnostic therapeutic target associate cerebrovascular repair process stroke . The tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) specifically bind integrin αvβ3 receptor . Accordingly , variety radiolabeled RGD-based peptide develop non-invasive imaging integrin αvβ3 expression via positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) monitor angiogenesis clinical Oncology Cardiology . In Neurology , angiogenesis imaging base integrin αvβ3 receptor find clinical trial , preclinical animal study show great potential clinical translation . Recently , series RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αvβ3 binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence . As representative , 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model also tumor myocardial infarction patient . No adverse reaction observe animal model patient date . For interest clinical translation 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 , open-label brain PET/CT study design investigate diagnostic performance 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 stroke patient convalescence . A single dose nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg BNOTA-PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image . Changes brain 18F-FDG PET/CT , enhance brain MRI CT , adverse event collect patient .</detailed_description>
