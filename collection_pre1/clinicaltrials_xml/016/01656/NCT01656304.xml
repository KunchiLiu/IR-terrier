	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well give bevacizumab work treat patient relapsed prostate cancer respond hormone therapy . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth prostate cancer block blood flow tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The rate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response avastin ( bevacizumab ) therapy androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer . II . Toxicities associate avastin therapy . III . Time PSA progression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer patient treat avastin . II . The change PSA velocity avastin therapy androgen-independent non-metastatic prostate cancer . III . Time distant metastatic disease . IV . Circulating tumor cell count . V. Changes level N terminal collagen peptide bone-specific alkaline phosphatase avastin therapy . VI . Correlation crosslinked N-telopeptide type I collagen ( NTX ) serum B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein ( BSAP ) level time PSA progression . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 14 day . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A histologic diagnosis prostate adenocarcinoma . No evidence bone/visceral metastasis visualize standard image bone scan , chest Xray , CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis . PSAonly progression despite androgen deprivation therapy . PSA progression define 3 rising level , minimum interval 2 week determination . The last determination must minimum value 1ng/ml determine within two week prior registration . If second third confirmatory value less previous value , patient still eligible repeat value ( No . 4 ) find great prior value . If patient antiandrogen past 28 day , PSA progression withdrawal period ( 28 day flutamide 42 day bicalutamide nilutamide ) require . ECOG performance status 01 . No prior avastin therapy . No investigational commercial agent therapy ( except LHRH agonist ) may administer concurrently intent treat patient 's malignancy . Patients LHRH agonist must continue use LHRH agonist therapy . Bisphosphonates administer per treat physician discretion . At least 4 week must elapse since prior systemic therapy , except LHRH analogue therapy steroid . If steroid use therapy prostate cancer , discontinue prior start avastin therapy . Age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy least 6 month . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent approve Institutional Human Investigation Committee . Use effective mean contraception subject . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg antihypertensive medication ) . Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure ( see Appendix E ) . History myocardial infarction unstable angina within last 12 month prior study enrollment . History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior study enrollment . Known CNS disease . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection ) . Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Patients anticoagulant allow patient therapy least 4 week patient acute thromboembolic activity . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within . 28 day prior study enrollment anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Core biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device , within 7 day prior study enrollment . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Proteinuria screen demonstrate : 1 . Urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio ≥ 1.0 screen Known hypersensitivity component avastin . Refusal use effective mean contraception . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition avastin . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients immune deficiency HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study lack safety data avastin patient .</criteria>
