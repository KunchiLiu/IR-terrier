Rather , parent usually refer child welfare system adult substance abuse system , unfortunately , seldom provide outreach need treatment engagement intensity breadth service need place parent family productive life trajectory . Four year ago , behest Connecticut Department Children Families ( DCF ) support Annie E. Casey Foundation , investigator develop comprehensive community-based treatment program address problem co-occurring parental substance abuse child maltreatment . Importantly , collaboration investigator Johns Hopkins University , program , name `` Multisystemic Therapy-Building Stronger Families '' ( MST-BSF ) , integrate innovative evidence-based treatment adult substance abuse , Reinforcement-Based Treatment ( RBT ; Tuten , Jones , Schaeffer , Wong , &amp; Stitzer , 2012 ) evidence-based treatment child abuse neglect call Multisystemic Therapy Child Abuse Neglect ( MST-CAN ; Swenson , Schaeffer , Henggeler , Faldowski , &amp; Mayhew , 2010 ) .

The present study involve rigorous randomize trial MST-BSF model , mature 4 year implementation . A feasibility review quasi-experimental evaluation MST-BSF complete prior study . MST-BSF acceptability feasibility support 87 % participant recruitment 93 % treatment completion rate . Regarding preliminary outcome , matched-comparison study ( N = 52 ) indicate MST-BSF effective comprehensive community treatment ( CCT ) provide Connecticut reduce out-of-home placement child ( 13 % vs. 39 % ) preventing reabuse ( CCT family , average , four time number substantiate report MST-BSF family ) 24 month post referral . In light promise result , hybrid efficacy/effectiveness ( real world practitioner , client , provider organization , service system ; clinical oversight treatment developer ; Fixsen , Naoom , Blas√© , Friedman , &amp; Wallace , 2005 ) study aim provide rigorous comprehensive evaluation MST-BSF . Specifically , study aim : Aim 1 : Determine effectiveness MST-BSF relative CCT achieve primary outcome reduce parental substance abuse , child maltreatment , child out-of-home placement . Hypotheses : 1 . Parents receive MST-BSF exhibit great reduction substance abuse child maltreatment . 2 .

Aim 4 : Assuming favorable outcome MST-BSF , evaluate possible moderator MST-BSF effect . Hypothesis : 7 . Consistent finding moderator analyse MST-related study ( e.g. , Huey &amp; Polo , 2008 ; Ogden &amp; Hagen , press ) , hypothesize favorable primary outcome moderate participant demographic characteristic ( e.g. , race , social class , gender child ) . Possible clinical level moderator ( e.g. , parent distress , number maltreatment referral baseline ) examine .</detailed_description>
