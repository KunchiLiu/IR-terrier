	<brief_title>Evaluation Association Between Genetic Load Response Anti-VEGF Therapy AMD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design single-center , observational case control evaluation compare genetic profile two group patient categorize accord anti-VEGF treatment response either `` positive '' `` suboptimal '' responder follow treatment either bevacizumab ranibizumab anti-VEGF agent . Positive suboptimal responder compare determine genetic variant distribution total genetic load associate anti-VEGF treatment response .</detailed_description>
