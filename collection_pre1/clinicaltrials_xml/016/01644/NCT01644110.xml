	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Pomalidomide Combination Therapy Patients With Primary Secondary MF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study open-label , single-arm , Phase-Ib/II trial ass efficacy oral drug combination ruxolitinib pomalidomide primary secondary MF patient . Dosages drug derive previous Phase-I/II study ; ruxolitinib treatment start 10 mg twice daily , whereas dose pomalidomide 0.5 mg daily . Dose reduction discontinuation allow case myelosuppressive effect . Intra-patient dose escalation permit ruxolitinib optimize efficacy therapeutic regimen ; pomalidomide give permanent dosage 0.5mg per day . Treatment response evaluate continuously treatment cycle ( 1 cycle = 28 day ) accord IWG-MRT criterion expand response criterion RCT-independency . In case progressive disease study therapy stop ; In patient show response stable disease , continuous therapy within study intend maximum 12 treatment cycle ; After completion 12 treatment cycle , therapy continue measurable benefit treatment evident . This extension discuss local principle investigator . Conditions lead patient withdrawal study detail protocol `` PATIENT WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION '' .</detailed_description>
