	<brief_summary>Spasticity condition result damage central nervous system cause painful muscle contracture drastically affect level independence , activity daily live , quality life . Although well-known accepted treatment spasticity , spasticity often leave undertreated ; specific reason observation unknown . Because blood test scan indicate presence spasticity , diagnosis base entirely physician impression . Therefore , investigator hypothesize one reason spasticity undertreated due lack standardize diagnostic procedure . This study attempt test reliability diagnostic flowchart seek increase accuracy physician diagnosis spasticity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spasticity define velocity-dependent increase stretch reflex muscle overactivity , associate involuntary limb movement spasms often painful . Active function ( walk , drive , write , sexual activity ) adversely affected spasticity . For patient significant disability require caregiver , passive function ( facilitation bathing , dress , undergarment change ) also become difficult , especially spasticity leave untreated . Finally , persistent involuntary motion spasm may negatively impact individual 's mood self image , make social situation difficult sometimes overwhelm . Spasticity especially undertreated vulnerable population ; population survey individual intellectual disability nursing home resident show less 20 % affected individual treat . There severe negative consequence leave spasticity untreated , like muscle shorten tendon soft tissue contracture . Once developed , contracture difficult treat hinder personal hygiene dressing , well ability sit lie properly . Bad hygiene immobility lead , turn , urinary tract infection , pressure ulcer skin breakdown . Furthermore , spasticity stunt muscle growth cause abnormal bone growth formation , especially child . Spasticity diagnose base upon physician 's clinical impression ; currently biomarker facilitate objective diagnosis . The two instrument commonly use document severity Modified Ashworth Scale Range Motion Assessment . Both assessment base upon clinician 's assessment muscle tone , widely-accepted protocol determine presence spasticity . We therefore hypothesize one reason spasticity widely undertreated challenge face physician attempt make diagnosis . In absence biomarker , standardize method clinical diagnosis necessary , future research advocacy effort . The treatment spasticity could increase quality life allow individual participate independently activity daily live , make assistance easy caregiver .</detailed_description>
