	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Idelalisib Treating Patients With Recurrent Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 idelalisib twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment lenalidomide idelalisib repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary secondary objective study include follow : Primary Objective : - To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combine idelalisib patient recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Secondary Objectives : - To determine toxicity profile lenalidomide idelalisib therapy patient recurrent follicular NHL - To estimate efficacy ( overall response rate [ ORR ] , complete response rate [ CRR ] , progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) lenalidomide idelalisib patient recurrent follicular NHL preliminary fashion ( use small extension cohort ) - To assess whether therapeutic effect lenalidomide idelalisib combination sufficiently promise warrant evaluation subsequent ( phase II/III ) randomize trial After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 24 month annually . Patients follow every year maximum 10 year study entry .</detailed_description>
