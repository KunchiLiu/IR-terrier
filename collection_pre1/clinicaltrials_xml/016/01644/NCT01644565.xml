	<brief_title>Safety Study Chimeric Vaccine Prevent ETEC Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity dsc14cfaEsCTA2/LTB5 ( Chimera ) dscCfaE administer without LTR192G intradermal ( ID ) immunization gather additional data administration dsCfaE LTR192G via transcutaneous immunization ( TCI ) route . If vaccine find safe adequately immunogenic human , down-selection would occur phase 2b vaccination/challenge study would undertake evaluate vaccine safety allow preliminary assessment efficacy one candidate ID TCI route . With favorable evidence safety , immunogenicity , efficacy , complement advance standard methodology combine multiple adhesins appropriate LT enterotoxoid form , multivalent vaccine would construct evaluated clinical development .</detailed_description>
