	<brief_title>Can Post-operative TAP Block Improve Quality Recovery After C-sections Patients Methadone Maintenance ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cesarean section common surgical operation perform U.S ( 1 ) . Patients require c-section methadone maintenance often uncontrolled pain due opioid tolerance . The current treatment utilize large amount opioids via PCA thus result challenge situation poor patient satisfaction . The Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block study success many abdominal surgery include c-section ( 2-5 ) . The anterior abdominal wall innervate anterior division spinal segmental nerve lie transversus abdominis internal oblique muscle layer . Blockade nerve local anesthetic may last 24 hour . There efficacy study perform use TAP block patient receive chronic methadone maintenance undergoing c-section . Methods : This prospective randomize double-blind placebo control study ( 0.375 % Ropivacaine vs. 0.9 % saline ) design evaluate effectiveness transverse abdominis plane ( TAP ) block first 48 hour c-section patient receive methadone therapy . The TAP block perform regional anesthesiologist operate room delivery baby . Objective : The primary objective study measure pain level c-section patient receive methadone therapy utilize visual analog scale ( VAS ) assess opioid consumption first 48 hour compare placebo . Conclusion : It hypothesize patient receive TAP block decrease pain intensity less opioid consumption first two postoperative day compare placebo . Therefore believe postoperative TAP block effective adjuvant pain control patient methadone maintenance follow c-section .</detailed_description>
