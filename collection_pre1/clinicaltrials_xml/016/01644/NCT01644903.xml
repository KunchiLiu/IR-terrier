	<brief_summary>This study do test blood , urine tissue sample see help decide CKD ( Chronic Kidney Disease ) , AR ( Acute Rejection ) HCV ( Hepatitis C Virus ) identify early stage . CKD damage kidney , AR HCV low body 's ability function properly . Early detection condition could assist successful treatment possibly lead less repeat organ transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With advent sensitive molecular technique , biomarkers kidney transplant rejection propose potentially much sensitive , specific rapidly testable conventional predictor graft function GFR tissue biopsy . Some early biomarkers evolution Cytotoxic T-cell ( CTL ) transcript like perforin , granzyme B fa ligand 11-13 acute rejection . In case CAN/IFTA CKD molecular mechanism testable biomarkers also remain unclear . A study report involvement TGF-beta , extracellular matrix protein like fibronectin thrombopondin tissue inhibitor metalloproteins ( TIMPs ) upregulated patient Chronic Allograft Nephropathy ( CAN/IFTA ) . Most study do kidney transplant biopsy challenge test expression correlation PBL minimally invasive tool address study . Another limitation first study lack power profile gene globally . To end advent DNA microarrays bring quantum leap ability profile thousand gene simultaneously . Thus far , microarray analysis report kidney transplant study implicate gene signature acute rejection transplant biopsy well first time u peripheral blood . To knowledge two study try profile CAN/IFTA peripheral blood . A recent study attempt validate three gene derive microarray analysis kidney biopsy use RT-qPCR . All three gene significantly differentially express urine PBL . Another study use microarrays show among panel 49 peripheral blood gene purport distinguish `` operational tolerance '' kidney rejection , 33 gene could also distinguish `` chronic rejection '' 86 % specificity . Most study literature , include , well recent unpublished peripheral blood gene expression study AR CAN/IFTA reveal clear molecular signature form transplant outcome . In sum , data establish first proof concept peripheral blood gene expression profile use develop marker kidney allograft rejection chronic kidney injury .</detailed_description>
