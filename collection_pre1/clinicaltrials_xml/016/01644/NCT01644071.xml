	<brief_summary>Aggressive behavior ( AB ) major burden society severe socio-economic consequence . Genetic study suggest high heritability AB ; particular , low express allele MAOA gene ( MAOA-L ) associate increased AB . Recent neural aggression model suggest dysfunctional emotion regulation circuit include amygdala , orbitofrontal , anterior cingulate cortex . Dysregulated serotonergic ( 5-HT ) projection anterior cingulate cortex amygdala suggest promote aggressive behavior . This find well line observation MAOA-L allele lead reduce expression monoamine oxidase A thus overflow 5-HT serotonergic cortico-amygdalar projection . However , due methodological ethical constraint , neural substrate AB difficult ass . A possible solution use virtual violence permit AB virtual character without direct consequence real person easily apply functional imaging experiment . There evidence virtual real aggression share common neural substrate . AB violent video game inhibit rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) amygdala line suggest neurophysiological circuit underlie real-life AB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study plan comprise assessment brain activation pattern virtual AB violent video game functional magnetic resonance imaging three experimental condition randomize , double-blind fashion : 1 . Increase synaptic 5-HT selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI , Cipralex Â® ) ; 2. reduction synaptic 5-HT Rapid Tryptophan Depletion Test ( RTD ) ; 3 ) Placebo . A blood sample genotyping assess allelic expression MAOA gene . We hypothesize 1. modification ACC-amygdala system serotonergic intervention 2. interaction genotype concern MAOA gene . The result study give valuable insight neurogenetic biology underlie aggression open new perspective therapeutical pharmacological intervention .</detailed_description>
