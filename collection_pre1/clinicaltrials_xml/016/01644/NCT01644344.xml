	<brief_summary>The standard post-operative radiographic protocol monitoring fracture HSC include post-operative hospital radiograph well radiographs two week follow appointment . This addition good quality intra-operative radiograph . With current operative technique implant , orthopaedic surgeon achieve reliably stable internal fixation . In fact , patient often allow take weight fracture limb immediately post-operatively . In case , redundant post-operative radiograph likely represent avoidable cost system financially , avoidable cost patient additional time spend hospital unnecessary radiation exposure .</brief_summary>
