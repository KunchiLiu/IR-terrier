	<brief_summary>The purpose trial ass safety efficacy Xoft Axxent eBx System use single-fraction IORT early stage breast cancer . Hypothesis : IORT use Xoft Axxent eBx System bad ( non-inferior ) whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) use stand-alone radiation treatment breast conserve therapy woman early stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Xoft® Axxent® eBx™ IORT System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale IORT sole radiation therapy : Favorable preliminary result feasibility , safety efficacy outcome : Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation ( APBI ) accept alternative whole breast irradiation follow breast-conserving surgery early stage breast cancer . Intra-Operative Radiation Therapy ( IORT ) form APBI allow radiation deliver directly open tumor bed follow Breast Conservation Surgery ( BCS ) . After 4 year follow-up , IORT show equivalent disease control rate whole breast irradiation . Direct timely radiation tumor bed : Radiation deliver target tissue ( adjacent resection margin time lumpectomy ) . It avoid treatment delay eliminate week month post-surgical radiation therapy residual cancer cell might proliferate . An vitro study show un-irradiated wound fluid stimulate growth breast cancer cell irradiate wound fluid . Each month delay radiation treatment associate 1 % increase recurrence rate . Huang , et al. , find 5.8 % recurrence rate patient receive WBRT within 8 week BCS compare 9.1 % recurrence rate patient start radiotherapy 9-16 week BCS . Increased patient treatment compliance compare conventional radiation therapy : Suitable early stage breast cancer patient able complete breast cancer radiotherapy treatment time BCS , offer convenient potentially life-saving benefit patient might otherwise omit radiation therapy require lengthy travel time commitment . In addition , healthcare resource , include personnel facility , conserve eliminate overhead cost multiple patient visit , eliminate wait time patient , consolidate therapy one visit combine surgical procedure . Available Technology : The Xoft Axxent controller , x-ray source , balloon applicator clear United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) deliver brachytherapy treatment use high dose rate x-ray radiation . The Xoft Axxent System use treat breast cancer subject use multi-fraction APBI technique outpatient basis part two multi-center study . The Xoft Axxent System enable Radiation Oncologist administer electronic brachytherapy without use radioactive isotope minimally shield room . Characteristics Xoft System make well-suited IORT include portability low energy photon , allow minimal shield radiation therapy . This protocol develop study use Xoft Axxent eBx System delivery IORT subject early-stage breast cancer . The Xoft Axxent eBx System use accord United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 510 ( k ) clear labeling ; therefore , use technology study consider on-label within scope FDA clear indication .</detailed_description>
