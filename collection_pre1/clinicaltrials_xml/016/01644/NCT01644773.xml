	<brief_summary>This phase I study find high tolerable dose crizotinib dasatinib give combination patient diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) type high grade glioma ( HGG ) . Participants receive escalate dos high dose determine . Participants enrol two stratum : stratum A recurrent/ progressive tumor stratum B recently diagnose patient complete standard radiation therapy without progressive disease . Up 7 dosage level test . Both drug take orally daily , per day . Correlative pharmacokinetic biology study plan , well advanced method magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Crizotinib Dasatinib Pediatric Research Participants With Diffuse Pontine Glioma ( DIPG ) High-Grade Glioma ( HGG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Rolling 6 design use estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) combination escalate dos crizotinib dasatinib . Our goal accrue research participant stratum A B . However , expectation accrual research participant stratum B proceed slow pace . Therefore , initially strategy dose escalation exclusively base research participant treat stratum A MTD combination reach . Until MTD combination reach research participant stratum A , accrual research participant stratum B allow high dosage level already deem safe ( i.e. , DLTs three research participant ≤ 1 DLT six research participant ) . No research participant accrue stratum B least one dosage level confirm safe stratum A . Once MTD stratum A reach , accrue research participant dosage level stratum B following rule Rolling 6 design . If MTD stratum A well tolerate among research participant stratum B , proceed dose escalation research participant stratum B base rule Rolling 6 design . This strategy base premise research participant heavily pre-treated ( stratum A ) may tolerate therapy well minimal previous treatment ( stratum B ) . Primary Objectives : - To estimate MTD combination crizotinib ( c-Met ALK inhibitor ) dasatinib ( bcr-abl , PDGFRA B , src , lck , yes , c-kit inhibitor ) pediatric research participant recurrent progressive DIPG HGGs ( stratum A ) . - To estimate MTD combination crizotinib dasatinib research participant DIPG HGG complete RT within short interval prior enrollment experience disease progression ( stratum B ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ALL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS Diagnosis highgrade glioma ( HGG ) diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . If histologic confirmation obtain , diagnosis must one following : anaplastic astrocytoma ( WHO grade 3 ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( WHO grade 3 ) , anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ( WHO grade 3 ) , anaplastic ganglioglioma ( WHO grade 3 ) , pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma anaplastic feature ( WHO grade 3 ) , malignant glioneuronal tumor , glioblastoma , gliosarcoma ( WHO grade 4 ) Age &gt; = 2 year &lt; = 21 year Performance score &gt; = 50 ( Lansky research participant &lt; = 16 year Karnofsky &gt; 16 year ) . Adequate organ function time enrollment follow : Bone marrow : Hemoglobin &gt; = 8g/dL [ may receive packed red blood cell transfusion ] , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1000/mm^3 , platelet &gt; = 100,000/mm^3 [ transfusion independent ] ) Renal : Normal serum creatinine base age show GFR &gt; 70ml/min/1.73m^2 : Age &lt; = 5 year : 0.8 mg/dL maximum Age 5 10 year : 1.0 mg/dL maximum Age 10 15 year : 1.2 mg/dL maximum Age &gt; 15 year : 1.5 mg/dL maximum Hepatic : SGPT SGOT &lt; 3x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin concentration &lt; 1.5x institutional ULN , albumin &gt; = 2g/dL Female research participant &gt; = 10 year age postmenarchal must pregnant ( confirm serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week study enrollment ) breastfeed Female research participant childbearing age male research participant child father potential must agree use safe contraceptive method duration study 3 month thereafter STRATUM A Diagnosis recurrent progressive HGG DIPG . Neurological deficit must stable fixed decrease dose dexamethasone ≥7 day study enrollment . Recovery ≤ grade 1 significant toxicity previous therapy . Irradiation : Interval last dose local radiation therapy ( RT ) , craniospinal RT , palliative RT symptomatic disease &gt; = 3 month , &gt; = 6 month , &gt; = 2 week study enrollment , respectively Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Interval &gt; = 6 week &gt; = 4 week last dose nitrosourea chemotherapy drug study enrollment , respectively . However , interval must &gt; = 1 week last dose oral etoposide drug administer low dos ( metronomic regimen ) study enrollment SmallMolecule Inhibitors : Interval &gt; = 1 week last dose study enrollment . If previously use agent prolonged halflife , appropriate interval determine consultation principal investigator Monoclonal Antibodies : Interval &gt; = 3 halflives study enrollment . Such case need discuss principal investigator HighDose Chemotherapy StemCell Rescue : Interval &gt; = 3 month study enrollment Cancer Vaccines ConvectionEnhanced Therapies : Interval &gt; = 1 month study enrollment Growth Factors : Interval &gt; = 1 week &gt; = 2 week study enrollment standard longacting growth factor ( e.g. , pegfilgrastim ) , respectively STRATUM B Completion local RT without concomitant chemotherapy include temozolomide radiosensitizing agent ( e.g. , carboplatin , vorinostat ) outside context clinical trial . Any agent administer RT short halflife already completely eliminated start therapy . If agent use concurrently RT , need discuss principal investigator ass eligibility Interval &gt; = 4 week &lt; = 8 week completion radiochemotherapy ALL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS Metastatic disease stratum B Concomitant use anticancer ( except corticosteroid ) experimental agent Use enzymeinducing anticonvulsant ( EIACs ) .
