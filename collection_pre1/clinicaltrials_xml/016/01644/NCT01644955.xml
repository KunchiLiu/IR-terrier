	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish maximum tolerate dose define toxicity profile carboplatin deliver intracerebrally via convection enhance delivery ( CED ) patient high grade glial neoplasm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine efficacy define six-month progression free survival ( PFS ) , median progression free survival , overall survival , radiographic response rate . II . Evaluate drug distribution . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study . Patients undergo craniotomy receive carboplatin intracerebrally via convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) 72 hour .</detailed_description>
