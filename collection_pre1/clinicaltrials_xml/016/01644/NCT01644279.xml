	<brief_summary>The age-related loss muscle mass strength , also term sarcopenia , commonly recognize consequence age associate frailty , functional loss , hospitalization , increase mortality among old people . Sarcopenia consequences considerable economic impact , since estimate healthcare cost attributable sarcopenia US 2000 $ 18.5 billion . Preclinical animal model strongly suggest apoptosis , program cell death , might play prominent role age-related muscle wasting . In specific aim one , investigator assess extent muscle apoptosis muscle biopsy obtain vastus lateralis muscle young control subject ( age 20-35 ) high-performance low-performance old subject ( age range 70-99 year ) . In specific aim 2 , investigator investigate role Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP-1 ) apoptosis-inducing factor ( AIF ) induction skeletal muscle apoptosis . In specific aim 3 , investigator propose investigate contribution muscle energy deficit , due age-related mitochondrial dysfunction , development muscle wasting . Finally , specific aim 4 , investigator propose reassess four year physical performance , muscle mass extent muscle apoptosis , high-performing participant , order correlate eventual decline physical function , muscle mass functional status , change muscle apoptosis biochemical parameter old population . Physical performance establish accord summary performance score obtain Short Form Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . In addition SPPB investigator also employ hand grip strength knee extensor strength test investigator quantify muscle contractile area use 3D magnetic resonance imaging . Disability assess use self-report questionnaire . These study enhance understand biology pathophysiology underlie geriatric syndrome sarcopenia provide significant novel insight enable u identify new potential target intervention aim prevent treat sarcopenia functional impairment old adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 . To determine extent muscle apoptosis age young healthy control high-functioning low-functioning old subject . The investigator hypothesize observed level muscle cell apoptosis associate physical disability . The investigator recruit cohort ten young control subject ( age 20-35 ) . The investigator also recruit stratify cohort forty elderly ( age 70-99 year ) two distinct category set criterion base level physical performance . Subjects summary performance score ≥ 11 Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) ( 66 ) consider high-functioning . Conversely , subject summary performance score ≤ 7 consider low-functioning . In addition SPPB , investigator also perform hand grip strength test isokinetic knee extensor test , implement 3D magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) precisely quantify quadriceps contractile area . The investigator obtain muscle biopsy subject determine severity apoptosis use biochemical histological analysis ( see Methods ) . Disability assess use self-report questionnaire . Hence , investigator determine extent muscle apoptosis investigator able correlate level physical disability muscle mass . Specific Aim 2 . To elucidate role Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP-1 ) apoptosis-inducing factor ( AIF ) induction apoptosis human skeletal muscle . The investigator hypothesize observe cell loss due apoptosis mainly related caspase-independent mechanism . The investigator recently show activation mitochondrial caspase-independent pathway apoptosis may play important role caspase-dependent pathway contribute nuclear cell death ( 67 ) . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize PARP-1/AIF pathway apoptosis might involve age-related muscle waste process . The investigator quantitatively assess PARP-1 AIF correlate measure extent muscle apoptosis . Specific Aim 3 . To assess role mitochondrion dysfunction energy failure muscle apoptosis , sarcopenia , disability . The investigator hypothesize mitochondrial dysfunction result reduce production adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) causally relate sarcopenia , possibly trigger apoptosis program . It estimate mean ATP production quadriceps muscle old human subject approximately 50 % young subject ( 68 ) , postulate energy failure might trigger apoptosis ( 58 ) . Consistently finding , investigator recently find rat ' gastrocnemius muscle , ATP content rate ATP production decline ~50 % age ( 59 ) . The investigator quantitatively assess myocytes ' ATP content along key mitochondrial metabolic enzyme , namely citrate synthase , cytochrome-c-oxidase ( COX ) , ATPase , aconitase . The investigator correlate parameter level apoptosis measure physical performance , disability , muscle mass . Specific Aim 4 . To correlate change physical function muscle mass muscle apoptosis biochemical parameter follow-up ( longitudinal study ) . After 4 year subject high-performance group reevaluate muscle apoptosis rate , PARP-1 AIF activity , energy production . The investigator correlate parameter measure physical performance muscle mass assess MRI , well self-reported disability . Hence , investigator able directly correlate eventual decline physical performance , muscle mass functional status old age change muscle apoptosis biochemical parameter . Research Plan : Using cross-sectional design ( age 20-35 70-99 year ) investigator quantify level apoptosis vastus lateralis muscle healthy ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) population . Apoptosis irreplaceable post-mitotic cell may important mechanism development sarcopenia investigate healthy human age . A variety chronic disease document case apoptosis human skeletal muscle ; i.e. , chronic pulmonary disease ( 69,70 ) patient heart failure ( 69,71,72 ) . However , essential establish baseline level apoptosis relatively healthy human proceed complex condition , disease condition frailty . In addition , investigator determine knee extensor strength , myocyte volume , extra cellular space myonuclear domain ( cross-sectional muscle area/nucleus ) quantify number nucleus within cross-sectional area muscle . This specific aim establish baseline level apoptosis assess standard measure assess sarcopenia . Study design . To accomplish aim , investigator propose two separate , yet complementary study 1 . In order gain insight change apoptosis potential age contribution muscle mass strength loss , investigator quantify level apoptosis vastus lateralis muscle young ( age 20-35 year ; N =20 ) , old high-functioning , ( age 70-99 year ; N = 25 ) , old low-functioning ( age 70-99 year ; N = 20 ) subject . Muscle biopsy MRI scan quantify quadriceps contractile area perform study participant . Muscle strength assess hand grip strength test isokinetic knee extensor test . 2 . Preliminary data contribution skeletal muscle apoptosis sarcopenia , physical function loss advance age gather quantify extent muscle apoptosis vastus lateralis muscle old ( age 70-99 year ) , high-functioning ( N = 25 ) low-functioning ( N = 20 ) subject , along measure muscle mass ( MRI ) , muscle strength ( hand grip knee extension test ) , overall physical performance ( Short Physical Performance Battery , SPPB ( 67 ) ) . In addition , investigator collect preliminary data regard role mitochondrial-driven apoptosis muscle waste functional loss old age . A brief physical exam administer study participant , major biological sign ( body weight , stand height , body temperature , blood pressure , pulse ) record . A basic questionnaire regard participant ' health history also administer After four year old participant reevaluate physical performance , functional status muscle mass ( MRI ) , muscle apoptosis , biochemical parameter Disability also assess use self-report disability questionnaire . In order gain information regard change physical performance functional status time maximize retention , annual visit employ SPPB , hand grip knee extensor testing , schedule old participant .</detailed_description>
