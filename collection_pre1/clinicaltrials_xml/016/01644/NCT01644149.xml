	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assessing Immunologic Response Influenza Vaccine Delivered Using Jet Injection Device Needle Syringe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle-free jet injection device create fine stream pressurize liquid able deliver vaccine pharmaceutical product beneath skin . Design aspects quality , pressure , orifice size , angle injection relative skin injection stream coherence control depth product deliver . This technology provide safer delivery option patient healthcare staff remove need needle administration vaccine . In addition improve safety , additional benefit use jet injector include consistent reliable dose volume delivery , reduce vaccine waste , diminish need transport large quantity sharp , reduce risk needle stick , syringe reuse , cost associate sharps waste . Jet injector offer needle-free procedure individual adverse needle . This study compare efficacy disposable syringe jet injection device ( Stratis ) traditional needle syringe ( NS ) administration delivery trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine . Efficacy evaluate compare measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) ; specifically GMTs , seroconversion seroprotection . Safety two administration device evaluate comparison incidence solicit local systemic adverse event .</detailed_description>
