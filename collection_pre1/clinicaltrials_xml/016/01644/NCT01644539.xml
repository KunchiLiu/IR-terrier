	<brief_summary>The amount kind food ingest influence regulation meal size . Neural signal gastrointestinal tract travel via vagus nerve brainstem thalamus , project rest brain , particular hypothalamus , amygdala primary sensory cortex . In neuroimaging study stomach distend gastric balloon activation observe right insula , leave posterior amygdala , leave posterior insula , leave inferior frontal gyrus anterior cingulate cortex . So far , study examine effect ingestion infusion food brain . In addition neural signal , hormonal signal important meal termination . Hormones like insulin , ghrelin cholecystokinin interact gastric well sensory signal process satiation , ultimately lead meal termination . The aim study investigate interaction food administration , hormone response brain response . To end oral intra-gastric load administer measure brain activity ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) hormone concentration . Subjects participate one training session three functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) session ( 35-min fMRI scan ) . A training session take 40-minutes consists place naso-gastric tube ingest 500 ml chocolate milk orally . The fMRI session consist three condition : condition one ( A ) 500ml chocolate milk administrate orally . In condition two ( B ) three ( C ) intra-gastric load 500 ml administrate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedures 1 . Screening : Before inclusion study , potential subject complete screen questionnaire Subjects inform eligibility . Also procedure risk explain . If decide participate , fill sign standard MRI-screening form inform consent form . Also train session date plan . 2 . Training session : When subject want participate match criterion train session plan . During train session naso-gastric tube insert qualified nurse ( accord `` maagsonde-protocol '' UMC Utrecht ) . After insertion tube subject rest allow water use assist insertion tube leave stomach become comfortable tube . During insertion nurse subject see subject handle naso-gastric tube participate study . Subjects rate hunger , fullness , thirst , desire eat , prospective consumption , nauseous , anxiety VAS scale . To simulate position MR scanner , subject ask lie doctor table . A towel place need right side , way stomach position standing/sitting , simulate normal gastric filling . A tube place teeth subject ( like straw ) oral load 500 ml ingest tube month . This ingestion drive pomp ( 100ml/min ) , simulate sip systematically . First 200 ml ingest , pause 30 second , second next 150 ml pump , follow 30 second rest period , last 150 ml ingest . The subject know rate speed sip stop pomp command necessary . The subject also hear tone sip ingest . Here subject learns drink naso-gastric tube place lie . After ingestion subject fill questionnaire . The naso-gastric tube remove rating . This training session take 40 minute . 3 . Assessments procedure study day : All subject ask arrive morning overnight fast least 10 hour . The evening scan subject ask eat standardized meal give researcher ( AH kant &amp; klaar ) . An appetite questionnaire fill ( hunger , fullness , thirst , desire eat , quantity eat , desire eat something sweet savory , nauseous , anxiety ) . An intravenous cannula place qualified person . Next , naso-gastric tube place ( procedure training session ) . After subject place scanner ( train session towel need right side ) ; one blood draw do baseline measurement ( e.g . glucose , insulin , cholecystokinin ghrelin every time point ) . The appetite questionnaire fill scanner . A reference anatomic scan do . Now fmri session begin ; five minute baseline scanning , food administration start ( = 0 ) . This consist administration intra gastric load naso-gastric tube ( caloric non-caloric ) ingestion caloric load tube ( oral ) . Blood drawn = 2.5 , = 5 , = 10 , = 15 = 30 min . Before every blood sample subject give fullness nausea rating . One researcher stand next subject/scanner whole experiment . If aspiration occur researcher help immediately . The researcher also make sure subject know get scanner quick possible aspiration occur . At = 30 min subject take scanner fill appetite questionnaire . The naso-gastric tube intravenous cannula remove . Subsequently subject provide ad libitum breakfast buffet = 45 min . Food weight macro-nutrient intake record . After breakfast appetite questionnaire fill . 4 . Blood sample storage : On study day , 10 ml blood sample drawn certify experienced medical personnel . Blood sample put ice immediately centrifuged 1730 × g 10 min 4 ˚C . Blood material collection tube split two portion store , one portion analyse one portion backup . Blood serum store -80 ˚C Rudolf Magnus Institute sample collection complete . Only RMI laboratory personnel investigator access sample . Blood sample cod follow : P01 , P02 , etc . The key code know principal medical investigator personnel perform blood analysis . Samples keep 10 year destroy . 5 . Naso-gastric tube : A qualified nurse place naso-gastric tube . The placement go accord 'maagsonde -protocol ' ( UMC Utrecht ) . After insertion tube subject rest allow water use assist insertion tube leave stomach become comfortable tube . 6 . Withdrawal individual subject : Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason . Each subject complete study reason post-study screen end particular study day ensure drop-out result structural problem . Data subject withdraw prematurely used statistical analysis , far possible . 7 . Replacement individual subject withdrawal : In case subject withdraw study ( fMRI session ) , replace . If subject decides participate train session new subject recruit . 8 . Follow-up subject withdraw treatment : Subjects withdraw study follow , unless withdraw adverse event . 9 . Post-study screening : Subjects ask experienced study procedure . This information , subject willing share , use evaluate ( burden ) study protocol .</detailed_description>
