	<brief_summary>Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) public health problem Bangladesh , India Nepal . To control disease three country National kala-azar elimination program ongoing . One major pillar elimination program VL vector control . Currently public VL vector control program Bangladesh . In India program depend Indoor Residual Spraying insecticide . IRS DDT Nepal Alpha-cypermethrin . The sand fly , vector VL already resistant DDT hurdle relate IRS i.e . fund , logistics human resource make IRS unsustainable VL vector control method Nepal . Thus alternative IRS VL vector control highly desirable success national kala-azar elimination program three country . Through current research activity compare effectiveness three effective VL vector control method . They 1 ) Plastering household wall lime ( traditional method know study area ) , treatment possible sand-fly breeding place lime bleach powder ; 2 ) Installing durable wall lining contain deltamethrin main living room ( ) households ; 3 ) Impregnation exist bed-nets slow release insecticide tablet contain deltamethrin . The study find important national elimination program three country discover effective VL vector control method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visceral leishamniasis ( VL ; know kala-azar Indian Sub-continent ) deadly parasitic disease leave untreated . The disease report 109 district ( Bangladesh-45 , India-52 Nepal-12 ) . VL elimination programme launch 2005 three country set target reduce case one 10,000 population . Toward set target , vector control play significant role . Based experience past malaria eradication period Indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) insecticides take main pillar VL vector control . Operation like IRS expensive , labour-intensive , require sustainable infrastructure , supply insecticide , spray equipment , train personnel fund long-term period . These doubt sustainability IRS poor resource setting like Bangladesh . Thus alternative IRS vector control tool highly desire . Current research activity explore alternative IRS ( define `` insecticide '' ) . The propose three different type alternative IRS : 1 ) Plastering household wall lime ( traditional method know study area ) , treatment possible sand-fly breeding place lime bleach powder ; 2 ) Installing durable wall lining contain deltamethrin main living room ( ) households ; 3 ) Impregnation exist bed-nets slow release insecticide tablet contain deltamethrin . The study include three different type intervention arm one control arm ; Arm : 1 ) Indoor house wall floor plaster lime ( traditional method know study area ) include treatment outdoor breeding place lime bleach powder inhibit sand fly breeding . Arm : 2 ) Installing durable wall lining contain deltamethrin kill immature stage sand fly . Arm : 3 ) Impregnation exist bed-nets slow release insecticide , deltamethrin 4 ) Control group , intervention . VL endemic area 1200 household select identified 24 cluster base geographic characteristic . Minimum distance cluster 50 meter . Each cluster 50 household ( HHs ) different intervention apply . Five HHs select randomly cluster measure intervention effect sandfly density 2 consecutive night use CDC light trap 4 , 12 , 24 52 week intervention . Baseline sand fly density measure 2 week introduce intervention . Based base line sandfly data cluster rank high , moderate low equal number cluster assign intervention arm well control arm . Control HHs receive commercial insecticide treat bed-nets study . This study multi-centre cluster randomize trial three vector control method carry ICDDR , B , Bangladesh , RMRI , India BPKIHS , Dahran , Nepal simultaneously 12 month period . A total 3600 household three country ( Bangladesh-1200 , India-1200 Nepal-1200 HHs ) include study . The cost intervention assess apply combination bottom-up top-down costing approach provider 's perspective . Costs attributable effectiveness intervention ( i.e . reduction sandfly density intervention ) calculate separately comparison among three type intervention . Firstly ; input mobilize implement intervention identify , quantify value local currency separately . Based relationship input output , cost broadly classify fix cost variable cost . Standard procedure follow annualization capital cost use replacement cost , useful lifetime , discount rate correspond annualization factor take standard table . Shadow pricing consider input donate study purpose partner agency . Allocation factor ( e.g . % time spent staff , % use etc ) apply apportion joint cost . Summing-up fixed variable cost total cost intervention calculate separately . Average unit cost calculate divide total cost intervention correspond number household receive intervention . Finally relationship cost effectiveness correspond intervention ( ) represent cost effectiveness ratio comparison .</detailed_description>
