	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) stand among chronic disease high rise prevalence mortality , poor quality life , high re-hospitalization rate societal burden care . Current therapeutic management practice generally meet limited success . Research recent year highlight high level psychiatric co-morbidity COPD patient , major prognostic significance anxiety/depression COPD outcomes re-hospitalization , smoke cessation , quality life , survival . This suggest address psychiatric psycho-social aspect care prominent COPD patient may strongly positive impact outcome , available evidence effectiveness limit . The primary aim propose research evaluate effectiveness holistic disease management paradigm psychiatric liaison consultation ( CL ) integrate psychiatric respiratory care improve outcome COPD patient . This integrated psychiatric consultation liaison ( IPCL ) management paradigm include routine screening structure collaborative care anxiety major depressive symptom depressive/anxiety disorder COPD patient . We postulate IPCL care paradigm would reduce mood symptom , increase smoking quit rate , reduce symptom burden functional disability , improve quality life , reduce rehospitalization , emergency department ( ED ) unscheduled physician visit . A secondary aim evaluate cost effectiveness concurrently collect resource utilization data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Consultation Liaison Integrated Care COPD Patients With Psychiatric Co-Morbidity ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims The aim propose research evaluate effectiveness holistic disease management paradigm ) integrate psychiatric respiratory care ( Integrated Psychiatric Consultation Liaison , IPCL ) address high level psychiatric co-morbidity COPD patient improve COPD outcome . Methods Patient population Inpatients specialist outpatient establish clinical diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Settings Hospital base specialist outpatient inpatient acute care step-down care facility four hospital ( NUHS , AH , SGH CGH ) one community hospital ( SLH ) . The site PIs hospital Lim Tow Keang ( NUHS ) , Loo Chian Min ( SGH ) , K. Narendran ( CGH ) , Gerald Chua ( AH ) Tan Boon Yeow ( SLH ) . Study design Parallel group , randomize , control trial . Eligible individual randomly assign ( 1:1 ratio ) either : 1 . Integrated Psychiatric Consultation Liaison ( IPCL ) care ( N=450 ) ; 2 . Usual care . Patients group receive usual standard care ( N=450 ) . Baseline screen assessment . Prior randomization either IPCL UC arm , COPD patient screen anxiety /depression use Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS , see detail ) .21.For patient high HADS score ( â‰¥8 ) , semi-structured diagnostic assessment immediately perform use Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I Disorders ( SCID-I DSM-IV22 advanced practice nurse ( APN ) provisional diagnosis anxiety and/or major depressive disorder confirm psychiatrist , Cases significant anxiety depressive symptomatology meet DSM-IV threshold criterion classify subsyndromal case . Randomization . After informed consent sign patient eligibility confirm , patient randomize 1:1 ratio either intervention arm receiving IPCL care control arm receive usual care . Stratification center use ensure balance two arm across center . Random permute block use ensure balance time . The block length determine study statistician . The patient assign individual number upon randomization . This assigned randomized number identify patient use documentation patient study . The list randomization go Singapore Clinical Research Institute ( SCRI ) . Randomization may do via follow option : ( ) Direct web randomization : Authorized study center personnel randomize patient via password-protected internet web site available 24 hour day ; ( ii ) Envelope Randomization : In case web downtime due technical error , site personnel may randomize patient use back-up envelope provide upon activation site . IPCL Care Group For patient randomly allocate IPCL arm , 1 . Routine active screening diagnosis psychiatric co-morbidity use HADS follow appropriate SCID interview train APN , confirmation consultant psychiatrist , perform 3 monthly interval unscheduled scheduled outpatient consultation follow visit hospital admission . 2 . The appropriate management psychiatric psycho-social problem perform multi-disciplinary care team include respiratory physician , psychiatrist , advanced practice nurse nurse clinicians 3 . The APN nurse clinician perform critical role case manager patient educator . Psychoeducation critical care process component aim ensure majority ( 70 % ) COPD patient IPCL group psychological symptom accept psycho-social psychiatric care , contrast large majority patient conventionally refuse care , particularly UC group . 4 . The treatment case accord recommend treatment guideline anxiety/depression , individualize patient accord treatment plan draw psychiatrist , agreement respiratory physician . Treatment care management mild depressive symptomatology , psycho-social problem , severe major depression and/or anxiety disorder include appropriate pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic therapy ( cognitive and/or behavioural therapy ) psycho-social support . 5 . Where pharmacologic treatment indicate , preferred drug SSRI antidepressant prescribe accord local standard dosage . The recommend first line treatment Fluoxetine , dose 20 mg/day Escitalopram ( 10 20 mg/day ) . Alternatively , patient respond Fluoxetine Escitalopram 4 week , intolerable side effect may prescribe Venlafaxine XR , 75/mg/day , increase 150-225 mg/day OR Mirtazapine ( 15mg/day , increase 30-45 mg/day ) . If response , mood stabilizer electro convulsive therapy ( ECT ) psychosocial intervention add medication ( Figure 2 ) . 6 . Non-drug psychotherapy provide either psychiatrist psychological counselor appropriate ( patient depressive anxiety symptomatology ) . 7 . The case manager liaise medical social worker financial community service support . 8 . The nurse educator provide standard patient education behavioural modification include information disease medication COPD depression , change attitude behaviour particularly regard smoke cessation medication adherence , general psycho-social supportive counseling . 9 . Appropriate exist redesign treatment algorithms management protocol put together provide sourcebook draw individual care plan . 10 . Routine monitoring outcome assessment integrated part IPCL care perform 3 6 monthly interval appropriate : include perceive symptom breathlessness , exercise tolerance , spirometric measurement ( 12 month ) , smoke cessation , HADS , SGRQ quality life , acute COPD exacerbation , rehospitalization ( ) , emergency department visit , unscheduled physician visit etc . ( see schedule ) . 11 . Ad hoc follow visit schedule appropriate time therapeutic monitoring response . 12 . The management COPD proceed usual accord standard clinical practice COPD . Usual Care Control Group . For patient randomly allocate UC Control Group , 1 . The presence psychiatric co-morbidity identified standard condition usual care team , appropriate psychiatric consultation-liaison referral treatment effect deemed necessary . 2 . Treatment care management psychiatric psycho-social problem include appropriate pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic therapy psycho-social support , accordance standard recommend guideline practice COPD anxiety/depression . 3 . The assessment trial outcome perform 3 6 monthly interval appropriate ( perceive symptom breathlessness , exercise tolerance , spirometric measurement , smoke cessation , HADS , SGRQ quality life , acute COPD exacerbation , rehospitalization ( ) , emergency department visit , unscheduled physician visit etc . ) also perform , integral part Usual Care . 4 . Ad hoc outpatient follow visit schedule appropriate time therapeutic care monitoring response . 5 . The management COPD proceed usual accord standard clinical practice COPD . To mimic prevailing condition healthcare finance delivery , payment referrals hospital psychiatrist treatment , drug psychotherapy , regardless allocation IPCL UC group , borne patient use exist avenue health service financing ( Medisave , Medishield , and/or out-of-pockets ) appropriate . Trial relate scheduled assessment outcome measure All participant IPCL UC control arm assess baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month follow trial relate outcomes . We define loss follow-up ( LTFU ) incomplete ascertainment primary outcome subject randomize trial . Operationally , LTFU define absence least 2 consecutive assessment ( &gt; 6 month ) . Statistical Analysis Primary effectiveness end-points - HADS score - Breathlessness ( MRC Index ) - Six-minutes walking distance - Borg 's scale - FEV1 , FEV1/FVC , PEFR , SpO2 - BODE Index - Smoking quit rate - Functional health quality life ( SGRQ score , CAT score , quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) ) - Acute COPD exacerbation - Emergency department visit - Unscheduled physician visit - Re-hospitalization ( ) Secondary effectiveness end point : - Resource use direct cost care : - 1 . Resource use include inpatient service use ( No . time hospitalized total day hospital ) , outpatient service use ( physician visit consist GP visit specialist visit , ) medication use ( usage specific drug class ) - 2 . Direct cost care include cost outpatient medical mental health care , inpatient medical mental health service medication . - Mortality - COPD medication adherence - Psychiatric medication adherence</detailed_description>
