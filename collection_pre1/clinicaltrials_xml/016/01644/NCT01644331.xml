	<brief_title>Targeting Acute Congestion With Tolvaptan Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double blind , placebo control , multi-center clinical trial patient sign symptom consistent acute heart failure ( AHF ) within 24 hour presentation Emergency Department . A total approximately 250 patient enrolled trial . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either 2 treatment regimen : - Fixed-dose IV furosemide ( 1 x total daily oral dose ) give intravenously divide dos every 12 hour 40 mg IV Q12 hour , whichever great + oral Tolvaptan ( give 0 , 12 , 24 48 hour ) - Fixed-dose IV furosemide ( 1 x total daily oral dose ) give intravenously divide dos every 12 hour 40 mg IV Q12 hour , whichever great + oral placebo ( give 0 , 12 , 24 48 hour ) The study treatment regimen administer randomization 48 hour , point Tolvaptan/placebo discontinue diuretic treatment adjust treat physician 's discretion . The primary endpoint proportion patient least moderate improvement dyspnea Likert scale 8 AND 24 hour AND without need escalation therapy due worsen heart failure ( rescue therapy ) death within 24 hour . Patients follow daily duration hospitalization 7 day ( whichever shortest ) . All patient Day 30 follow phone contact assessment vital status interval hospitalization .</detailed_description>
