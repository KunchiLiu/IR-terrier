	<brief_summary>Study IDS116406 non-interventional , phlebotomy study Hunter Syndrome patient currently treat idursulfase , enzyme replacement therapy , least single patient na誰ve treatment , possible recruit . All patient enrol study single blood draw analysis antibody induce enzyme replacement therapy ( idursulfase ) . Patient sample positive response antibody induce idursulfase use evaluate whether antibody induce idursulfase bind GSK2788723 molecules vitro antibody neutralize bioactivity GSK2788723 vitro . Each subject screen visit , may occur regularly schedule out-patient visit . If patient consent participate study , blood sample ( total volume approximately 3mL ) immunogenicity analysis draw current treatment infusion</brief_summary>
