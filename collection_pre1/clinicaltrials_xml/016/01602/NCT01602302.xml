	<brief_title>Ultrasound Withdrawal Biological DMARDs Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) common inflammatory joint disease . It usually treat synthetic biologic disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) . Up 35 % patient achieve clinical remission combination therapy ; however , considerable uncertainty regard management patient clinical state achieve . The discontinuation biological agent patient persistent clinical remission may beneficial patient health care system reduce risk long term adverse event save cost , respectively . Up 60 % patient report flare cessation anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) therapy despite continuation synthetic DMARDs exist validate biomarkers predict patient suffer flare patient remain remission . Sonography use biomarker RA . Subclinical inflammation previously associate increase risk short term clinical relapse structural deterioration . The hypothesis prospective study ultrasound verified subclinical inflammation time bDMARD withdrawal predict disease flare week 16 . The investigator plan recruit RA-patients persistent clinical remission accord SDAI current corticosteroid therapy . At baseline , bDMARD stop , synthetic DMARDs continue . Patients undergo 9 study visit within 52 week . Ultrasound examination 14 joint well clinical laboratory assessment calculation SDAI score perform visit . Patients consider disease flare disease status change remission active disease accord clinical score . Patients flare disease exclude active phase study treat accord current guideline .</detailed_description>
