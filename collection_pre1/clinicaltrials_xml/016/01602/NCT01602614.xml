	<brief_title>Evaluation PK PD Ganciclovir Premature Infants Receiving Treatment CMV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , clinical sampling study ass ganciclovir pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics premature infant . Only subject receive ganciclovir clinical reason enrol . The decision initiate ganciclovir therapy make attend physician base upon his/her clinical decision treat virologically-confirmed CMV infection ; infant receive therapy meeting entry criterion eligible study . Therefore , ganciclovir provide protocol . Subjects meet enrollment criterion enter clinical trial . Subjects stratify gestational age chronologic age follow : 1 ) ≤ 27 week 6 day gestational age birth ≤ 30 day chronologic age study enrollment ; 2 ) ≤ 27 week 6 day gestational age birth &gt; 30 day chronologic age study enrollment ; 3 ) ≥ 28 week 0 day gestational age birth ≤ 30 day chronologic age study enrollment ; 4 ) ≥ 28 week 0 day gestational age birth &gt; 30 day chronologic age study enrollment . Eight subject enroll four group , total sample size 32 subject . Subjects cohort inadequate pharmacokinetic data analysis ( e.g. , due drop study PK assessment perform , blood sampling obtain inadequate analysis ) replace count toward total eight subject four group . Additionally , enrollment additional 2-3 subject may allow operational reason . A full pharmacokinetic profile obtain one ganciclovir dose receive enrollment . PK assessment obtain subject receive study assessment dose 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 intravenous ganciclovir . Specimens ship process time . The pharmacokinetic data provide study site , include AUC CL value information purpose . Duration intravenous ganciclovir therapy discretion treat physician dictate research protocol . Both whole blood CMV PCR urine CMV detection obtain study period long subject receive intravenous ganciclovir therapy . These specimen use determine blood viral load ganciclovir resistance . Since ganciclovir renally excrete drug , serum creatinine draw research protocol day ganciclovir pharmacokinetic specimen obtain order calculate creatinine clearance use method modify Schwartz formula , thus correlate ganciclovir clearance renal function . Otherwise , data hematology assessment ( WBC count differential , hemoglobin , platelet count ) chemistry lab ( serum creatinine , AST , ALT ) record study case report form study period obtain clinical reason , drawn purpose study . Ganciclovir dose information ( mg/dose , dose interval , patient weight ) record day pharmacokinetic blood draw , weekly Period 1 Period 7 long subject receive intravenous ganciclovir therapy . If patient continue receive intravenous ganciclovir Study Assessment Day 18 Study Assessment Day 24 ( Period 4 ) , second PK assessment may perform request treat physician subject weigh 575 grams time specimen collection .</detailed_description>
