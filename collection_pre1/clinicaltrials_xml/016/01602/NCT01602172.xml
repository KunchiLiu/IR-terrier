It recommend people keep alcohol consumption limit establish National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . A type 10-15 minute counsel know `` brief intervention '' ( BI ) show help risky drinker cut back NIH-recommended limit . This study examine impact nurse-delivered alcohol BI hospitalize Veterans ' weekly number drink , monthly number binge drink episode , readiness change drink behavior , alcohol-related problem .

	<detailed_description>Improving identification management alcohol misuse VA priority . Alcohol misuse include spectrum alcohol consumption range hazardous drinking alcohol use disorder ( alcohol abuse dependence ) . The VA recommend use set clinical strategy refer Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) identify address alcohol misuse primary care setting . Brief intervention ( BI ) , core component SBIRT , significantly reduce alcohol consumption , morbidity , healthcare utilization hazardous drinker , efficacy well-established outside outpatient setting . In hospital setting , nurse well-positioned deliver BI , research need determine efficacy inpatient nurse-delivered BI , particularly hazardous drinker . The previous trial BI inpatient set demonstrate limited effect alcohol consumption alcohol-related problem , potentially due assessment reactivity -- extensive patient assessment inadvertently raise patient awareness drinking group , mimic effect BI thus drive finding towards null . Additionally , trial involve nurse delivery intervention many include patient alcohol use disorder , patient believe beyond `` therapeutic reach '' BI . The primary goal 3-arm randomize controlled trial examine efficacy nurse-delivered alcohol BI hospitalize patient hazardous drinker identify barrier facilitator implementation BI inpatient setting . Arm 1 ( BI ) consist Veterans randomize nurse-delivered BI , Arm 2 ( AC ) consist Veterans randomized attention control , Arm 3 ( AC-LA ) consist Veterans randomized attention control limited assessment readiness change adverse consequence alcohol use reduce evaluate assessment reactivity . Specific Aim 1 determine impact nurse-led BI alcohol screening status , number drinks/week , number binge drink episode , readiness change drink behavior , adverse consequence alcohol use hospitalize hazardous drinker . Specific Aim 2 formatively evaluate process intervention implementation inform design execution future , multi-site randomized effectiveness trial intervention . A secondary aim identify factor , issue , theme related Veterans ' interest motivation change alcohol consumption . We recruit 320 hospitalized Veterans admit one three medical-surgical unit VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System . Veterans include &gt; 21 year old , able speak English , hazardous , non-dependent drinker , define criterion establish National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism Composite International Diagnostic Interview Substance Abuse Module . Patients randomize Arm 1 receive three-part nurse-delivered BI . Patients randomize Arms 2 3 receive usual care plus healthy lifestyle brochure address general healthy lifestyle behavior , limited alcohol consumption , tobacco cessation , weight management . For Specific Aim 1 , use various multivariable linear logistic regression account continuous outcome , dichotomous outcome , cluster within medical unit . Poisson regression negative binomial regression use continuous outcome measure normally distribute . For Specific Aim 2 , use basic descriptive statistic order describe number deviation interruption intervention delivery plan . Based interventionist field note , categorize type deviations/interruptions . We also use descriptive statistic describe duration audio-recorded intervention ; presence/absence various technique within BI ; receipt/nonreceipt additional alcohol feedback , advice , counsel ; patient responsiveness to/perceptions BI . We also code brief free-text perception response use modify grounded theory approach .</detailed_description>
