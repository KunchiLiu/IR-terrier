	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Minimally Invasive Surgery Versus Standard Surgery Correction Hallux Valgus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized prospective trial minimally invasive surgery versus standard surgery correction hallux valgus . Introduction It estimate 200,000 hallux valgus surgery perform year United States . [ 1 ] More 100 procedure describe correction hallux valgus . [ 2 ] Considerable controversy remain best technique . Recently , number minimally invasive technique correction hallux valgus describe . [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . These minimally invasive technique emphasize less traumatic surgical exposure limit dissection soft tissue . It propose minimally invasive procedure lead less pain , decrease swelling , short recovery time rapid return full weightbearing activity . Not report positive , author report increase number complication , include loss correction malposition bone [ 7 ] . Minimally invasive treatment hallux valgus become increasingly common podiatric orthopedic clinical practice , due theoretical advantage rapid recovery , rapid return full activity , decrease pain . These technique potential advantage provide good clinical outcome low cost . An increase number research publication topic appear recent year , reflect grow interest development field amongst foot ankle surgeon . However , despite increase interest , high-quality study procedures available . In 2011 systematic review [ 8 ] , 24 publication describe outcome minimally invasive hallux valgus surgery identify analyze . All study level IV quality ( case series , exception two level III ( retrospective comparative study ) . No randomized prospective control study publish , validate disease-specific outcome measure seldom use [ 9 ] . No high quality trial minimally invasive technique publish , result , basic question still remain unanswered : Do minimally invasive procedure few complication standard procedure ? Are minimally invasive procedure associate superior patient-based outcome ? Are radiographic outcome minimally invasive technique equivalent ? Randomized , prospective clinical trial require , utilize validate outcome measure . Study Objectives To compare patient-based outcome radiographic outcome minimally invasive surgery versus standard surgery correction hallux valgus . Primary Outcomes Measure The primary outcome measure Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire Score ( MOXFQ ) . Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire ' ( MOXFQ ) , 16 item patient-reported questionnaire consist three domains/scales : 'Walking/standing ' ( seven item ) , 'Pain ' ( five item ) 'Social interaction ' ( four item ) . The MOXFQ validate disease-specific outcome scale foot ankle surgery show responsive reliable . In observational study , minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) various domain MOXFQ 16 , 12 , 24 MOXFQ Walking/standing , Pain , Social Interaction domains , respectively . The MOXFQ demonstrate good responsiveness compare AOFAS forefoot score . Statistical analysis data show null hypothesis statistically significant difference group respect postoperative MOXFQ score 12 week , 1 year , 2 year 3 year reject . Secondary outcome measure preoperative postoperative change hallux valgus angle ( HVA ) . Radiographic outcomes parameter measure use weight-bearing radiograph analyze preoperative postoperative hallux valgus angle , correction normalization thereof . ( Degrees correction = preoperative HVA - 12 week postoperative HVA . ) Statistical analysis data show null hypothesis statistically significant difference group respect degree correction hallux valgus angle reject . Study Design Type Non-inferiority treatment study , open-label , randomize , prospective , control , parallel experimental design . Location Study-related patient visit take place office principal investigator , Dr. Henry DeGroot , white 544 , Newton Wellesley Hospital MOB Surgery take place operate room Newton Wellesley Hospital . Post operative evaluation take place office principal investigator Newton Wellesley Hospital cast room . Preoperative postoperative x-ray take place radiology department Newton Wellesley Hospital . Duration Subjects enrol sufficient number achieve two group , estimate require 36 month . The time active participation subject 12 week . The period long-term follow-up subject 36 month , begin date surgery . Research Plan Study Intervention The study compare two surgical technique correction hallux valgus , detail . Other intraoperative surgical technique , preoperative postoperative treatment identical subject . Radiographic examination foot ( x-ray ) make preoperatively two week postoperative 12 week postoperative , per usual customary practice principal investigator . The conventional surgical technique Chevron-type distal metatarsal osteotomy , perform dorsomedial incision approximately 7 cm long . And osteotomy distal portion first metatarsal make . The capital distal fragment metatarsal mobilize displace laterally adequate amount correct hallux valgus deformity . The capital distal fragment stabilize correct position screw . The internal fixation screw use conventional surgical technique require removal . Through incision , contract soft tissue lateral aspect metatarsophalangeal joint release . Per patient 's request consent , plan bony soft tissue pathology lesser toe require surgical correction ( eg , hammer toe ) treat surgical session use standard technique . The minimally invasive surgical technique transverse subcapital distal metatarsal osteotomy , perform direct medial incision approximately 1 cm long . The osteotomy distal portion first metatarsal make use fluoroscopic image guidance . The capital distal fragment metatarsal mobilize displace laterally adequate amount correct hallux valgus deformity . A 2.0 mm Kirschner wire place percutaneously position medial proximal phalanx , advance proximally use fluoroscopic guidance proximal end wire locate stable position within medullary cavity first metatarsal ( see figure ) .The distal end Kirschner wire leave outside skin cut length cover . The Kirschner wire remove six week . The soft tissue lateral aspect joint release . Per patient 's request consent , plan bony soft tissue pathology lesser toe require surgical correction ( e.g. , hammer toe ) treat surgical session use standard technique . Postoperative Care - - First post operative : one week postoperative - Second postoperative visit : two week postoperative - Third postoperative visit : 6 week postoperative - Last postoperative visit : 12 week postoperative Period Long Term Follow Up - 1 year follow - completion questionnaire . This complete email , regular mail , person , depend patient preference . - 2 year follow - completion questionnaire . This complete email , regular mail , person , depend patient preference . - 3 year follow - completion questionnaire . This complete email , regular mail , person , depend patient preference . Study Costs All cost associate usual customary perioperative , operative , postoperative care patient bill patient 's medical insurance . Subjects incur cost solely purpose research . Any study cost purpose research study support principal investigator . These cost expect large . The main cost time need inform patient study process , obtain consent , gather data store . The PI feel unsupported research feasible preferable alternative industry fund study , show much likely significant bias . Randomization Blinding After study subject enrol , randomize one two treatment group . All subject randomize , 1:1 either conventional surgery group ( group A ) minimally invasive surgery ( group B ) . Randomization take place enrollment via selection one multitude envelop contain random number . A block randomization technique use block size eight . Each random number preassigned either group A group B . The envelope contain patient 's group assignment open operating room immediately prior commence surgery . Due nature surgery , neither investigator patient effectively blind result group assignment . The patient make aware group assignment surgery . Primary outcomes measure secondary outcome measure The primary outcome measure Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire Score ( MOXFQ ) . Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire ' ( MOXFQ ) , 16 item patient-reported questionnaire . Secondary outcome measure preoperative postoperative change hallux valgus angle ( HVA ) . Data Collection Statistical Analysis The study document label patient random number , data store use unique random number identifier . The patient 's name group assignment appear study document . Data relate MOXFQ record visit summary document bear patient 's random number , later enter computerized spreadsheet use patient 's random number unique identifier . The patient personal data store along aggregate data . Data keep password secure computer office PI . Power Analysis Power analysis perform use G*Power 3.0.10 ( Department Experimental Psychology Heinrich-Heine-University 40225 Düsseldorf Germany - http : //www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower/ ) . Power calculate difference two independent mean ( two group ) . Given estimated population effect size ( ) 0.65 , probability alpha error ( significance ) 0.05 , require power ( 1- beta ) 0.80 , total required sample size would 78 ( two group 39 ) . The two-tailed test use assume difference treatment effect two group one direction , , assume treatment effect may either small large conventional surgery group minimally invasive surgery group . Our goal enroll 80 patient trial . For independent sample , Mann-Whitney test use examine difference two group . Study Endpoints The study endpoint occur sufficient number patient complete 36 month long term follow-up process . Our aim enroll minimum 60 maximum 100 patient . Once last patient enrol complete 36 month survey instrument , data collection phase study complete .</detailed_description>
