	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) common chronic visceral pain disorder ranking among common persistent pain disorder prevalence rate 8-12 % population.3 Diagnostic criterion IBS include persistent abdominal pain and/or discomfort associate change bowel habit . In majority patient , symptom co-morbid pain condition , epigastric pain ( functional dyspepsia ) , pelvic pain ( IC/PBS ) musculoskeletal pain ( FM ) report . Estimates &gt; 50 % U.S. workforce experience type pain 13 % lose productive work time due pain 2 week period , lead 60 billion dollar per year lose productivity costs.4 There generally agree upon biomarkers IBS , diagnose exclusively base subjective symptom criterion . As persistent pain disorder , IBS patient provider increasingly embrace biopsychosocial model incorporate psychological social factor along physiologic factor , form basis integrative treatment approach . This multimodal approach often incorporate Mind-Body treatment , grow literature show clinical efficacy IBS intervention incorporate Mind-Body approach meditation , hypnosis , yoga cognitive therapy.5 However , little understanding physiological mechanism underlie mind-body therapy , reason optimization treatment specific individual population difficult . In project aim use neuroimaging base biomarkers IBS examine physiological measure show change specific mind-body treatment previously document efficacy , Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Training MBSR . MBSR choose target treatment several reason : Recent clinical trial data suggest efficacy improve IBS symptom MBSR , demonstrate prior success chronic pain condition considerable literature meditation associate brain change . The primary Objective validate optimal biomarker candidate assessment treatment responsiveness IBS patient follow Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) . The secondary objective determine generality optimal biomarkers Aim 1 2 look factor sex , age , co-morbid pain mood symptom , and/or baseline disease severity moderator performance candidate biomarkers . Also , exploratory analysis perform assess effect 8 week MBSR training measure disease cognition , quality life mood define pre post test score behavioral measure list study method .</detailed_description>
