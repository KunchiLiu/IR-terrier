Subjects bipolar I disorder patient recent/current manic , hypomanic , mixed depressive episode . The study include open-label phase randomize phase . During open-label phase , subject lamotrigine monotherapy combination therapy escalation . The target dose lamotrigine 200 milligram ( mg ) /day monotherapy . The duration treatment open-label phase last 6-16 week , subject reach stable dose lamotrigine . Beginning week 7 open-label phase , subject reach stable dose lamotrigine meet response criterion , define maintain Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGI-S ) score &lt; = 3 least 4 continuous week maintain lamotrigine 200 mg/day monotherapy least 1 week , eligible enroll double-blind phase study . Subjects meet response criterion 16 week participation open-label phase withdrawn study . Subjects lamotrigine 200 mg/day monotherapy least 1 week prior randomization . Subjects meet randomization requirement randomize 1:1 lamotrigine 200 mg/day placebo 36 week double-blind treatment . After randomization , subject assess weekly interval first month , biweekly interval second month , monthly interval 36 week double-blind treatment . The primary endpoint TIME , define time intervention ( addition pharmacotherapy electroconvulsive therapy [ ECT ] ) mood episode ( relapse recurrence depressive , manic , hypomanic mixed episode ) randomization . The secondary endpoint include time intervention manic , hypomanic mixed episode ( TIMan ) time intervention depressive episode ( TIDep ) .The score Hamilton Depression ( HAMD ) , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , CGI-I , CGI-S Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) use indicator intensity duration mood symptom phase .
