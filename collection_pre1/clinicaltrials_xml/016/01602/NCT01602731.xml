	<brief_title>Targeted Intervention Improve Medication Adherence Cognitively Impaired Patients With HF ( TARGET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Medication adherence [ MA ] complex issue depend patient healthcare factor . Non-adherence due patient-dependent factor common ; analysis large broad-based clinical trial general population demonstrate 20-30 % study medication dos may miss . In community-dwelling HF patient polypharmacy percentage likely even high . One factor poor adherence elderly non-HF patient show cognitive impairment [ CI ] . Non-adherence medical regimen one factor associate bad outcome patient HF , include readmission . Measures improve MA also likely improve outcomes . Objectives : We evaluate novel intervention incorporate new technology goal improve adherence patient HF CI . Specific objectives study ( 1 ) ass feasibility use Automated Medication Dispensing Device ( AMDD ) veterans HF CI measure patient qualify rate , consent rate , user rate , patient-level response rate , medication-level response rate , success rate , ( 2 ) calculate improvement MA base pill count introduction AMDD , ( 3 ) qualitatively describe patient satisfaction AMDD reason use AMDD . Methods : This pilot design feasibility study test intervention use commercially available , shelf Automated Medication Dispensing Device ( AMDD ) subject serve control . The study conduct VALLHS , Loma Linda , CA serve population 246,000 veteran . The study plan enroll 50 patient HF CI ( define SLUMS score &lt; 27 person high school education &lt; 25 person less high school education ) outpatient HF clinic . Baseline adherence prescribe medication measure initial 30-day pill count ( month 1 ) . Subjects baseline adherence &lt; 88 % give AMDD use 90 day ( one month familiarize study subject device , two month collect outcome data ) . This dispenser pre-filled home health nurse month ; dispenser equip alarm mechanism alert patient take medication ; patient push button device , dispense medication . 30-day pill count perform patient use AMDD month 3 4 . The study power detect success rate AMDD , define patient acceptance clinical response AMDD . Status : Complete . This project open recruitment July 1 , 2012 . The study close recruitment enrol patient complete intervention . Manuscript outline finding study discuss available intervention improve medication adherence progress .</detailed_description>
