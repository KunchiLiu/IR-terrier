	<brief_summary>Type 2 Diabetes ( T2DM ) life-long , chronic condition affect individual ' ability regulate glucose level blood . Diabetes cause many severe complication treat properly . Hyperglycemia regular effect uncontrolled diabetes lead complication cardiovascular disease , chronic renal failure , diabetic retinopathy inability maintain healthy body weight . Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) lead cause death worldwide , affect million people develop non-developed country . The buildup cholesterol bloodstream may cause excess deposit coronary artery heart carotid artery brain . The cholesterol deposit factor plaque cause blockage artery turn lead heart disease stroke . By lower blood level cholesterol , risk heart disease , stroke heart attack reduce . Medications HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fibrates useful prevention CVD . Pravastatin member drug class statin , also know HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , show adjunctive therapy diet . It know reduce amount cholesterol fatty substance blood . In addition , pravastatin indicate reduce risk myocardial infarction , revascularization cardiovascular mortality hypercholesterolemic patient clinically apparent coronary heart disease . The recommended starting dose adult 40 mg daily . For patient reach LDL-C goal 40 mg , recommend use 80 mg dose . For person significant renal impairment recommend dose 10 mg. Children age 8-13 year recommend start dose 20 mg daily . Adolescents age 14 18 year recommend start dose 40 mg daily . Depression known common mental disorder prevalent type mood disorder today . It see state mood , symptom , syndrome clinical diagnosis . Depression common disorder , affect 121 million people worldwide . Depression likely co-occur medical illness stroke , heart disease , cancer diabetes . Up one-quarter people diabetes estimate experience depression two time suffer diabetes . Studies show major depression mainly occur 2¬4 percent people community , 5-10 percent primary care patient 10-14 percent medical inpatient . Also , recent study estimate symptom continue 6 month one year period patient major depression . The severity symptom incidence medical illness expect predict persistence depression . Depression treat effectively variety antidepressant and/or psychotherapy . If treat appropriately , 80 percent people suffer depression help . Paroxetine orally administer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant . It first antidepressant formally approve United States treatment panic attack , major depression , post¬traumatic stress disorder , social anxiety , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder . Paroxetine well-established safety profile share common side effect contraindication SSRI 's include nausea somnolence associate weight gain . This study propose conduct retrospective cohort study ass risk new onset diabetes among patient undergo treatment Pravastatin statins , Paroxetine SSRI 's . This study compare risk co administration two drug class versus use agent alone . In addition , risk among patient prescribe Paroxetine fibrates combination , relative use Paroxetine singly , examine determine whether interaction find Paroxetine statin extend drug indicate hypercholesterolemia . The first primary objective study estimate incidence Type 2 Diabetes ( T2DM ) among patient newly expose pravastatin combination paroxetine , SSRIs , compare newly expose pravastatin alone . The second primary objective estimate incidence Type 2 Diabetes ( T2DM ) among patient newly expose paroxetine combination pravastatin , statin , fibrates , compare newly expose paroxetine alone .</brief_summary>
