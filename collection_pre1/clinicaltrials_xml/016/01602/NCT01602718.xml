	<brief_summary>This study compare physical activity level physical functioning patient treat home dialysis vs. treat in-center dialysis . The investigator first compare prevalent patient , also compare two group longitudinally incident patient first 18 month begin dialysis treatment . Patients test physical functioning use standard performance-based test gait speed , chair stand , balance test , well self-reported limitation activity daily live . The investigator monitor physical activity use step counter activity questionnaire . Blood sample draw test time measure inflammatory marker . A pilot study home dialysis patient do determine effect independent home-based exercise program physical function inflammatory marker . For pilot study , 30 patient randomized exercise intervention usual care test baseline 3 month intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To determine level physical functioning , physical activity , incidence frailty inflammation status prevalent home dialysis patient University Utah Home Dialysis program compare in-center hemodialysis patient match age , gender , comorbidities dialysis vintage . Hypothesis 1 : Patients home therapy higher physical functioning , active few frail compare match patient treat in-center hemodialysis . Aim 2 : To determine pattern change physical function physical activity first 18 month initiate dialysis therapy . Hypothesis 2 : Physical function physical activity maintain patient initiate home dialysis therapy , whereas , initiate in-center dialysis deteriorate physical function physical activity . Aim 3 : To determine effect counsel encouragement physical activity prevalent home dialysis patient physical functioning , physical activity . Hypothesis 3 : Compared usual care , patient counsel encouraged participate independent home walking exercise improve physical function health-related quality life . Aim 4 : To determine association inflammation physical functioning home dialysis patient change physical activity . Hypothesis 4 : Lower physical functioning associate inflammation increase physical activity improve physical functioning reduce associate inflammation .</detailed_description>
