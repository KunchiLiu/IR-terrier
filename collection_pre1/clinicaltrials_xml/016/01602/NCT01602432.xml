	<brief_summary>Cancer increase risk deep vein blood clot clot travel lung ( embolus ) cause morbidity ( leg swelling , pain , shortness breath ) , sudden death , delay cancer treatment , decrease cancer survival 66 % compare similar cancer patient without blood clot . Blood thinner may prevent clot major bleed also problem , preventive therapy use routinely . Identifying patient high risk clot critical . A tool exist use outside research . We propose study apply tool clinical practice test work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementing Tool Identify Risk Venous Thromboembolism Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Cancer risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) include deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and/or pulmonary embolism ( PE ) markedly high non-Cancer patient . An acute episode VTE deleterious effect quality life long-term survival cancer patient . Cancer patient VTE survival rate one third otherwise identical patient without VTE . Once VTE diagnose 10 % cancer patient suffer event standard therapy 5 % suffer major hemorrhagic event . The best way treat VTE prevention ( thromboprophylaxis ) . Studies suggest among ambulatory cancer patient , risk VTE varies markedly patient lack knowledge risk , delay diagnosis hamper effort effectively prevent VTE . Therefore , identification patient high-risk VTE may enable fast diagnosis VTE good use thromboprophylaxis . Recent study develop novel tool stratify VTE risk cancer patient initiate anti-cancer treatment . We hypothesize risk tool accurately identify cancer patient high-risk implementation clinical practice result faster clinical diagnosis VTE . Our objective : ) evaluate ideal strategy incorporate tool clinical setting seamlessly possible , b ) determine whether tool accurately predict risk result faster investigation VTE . Patient eligibility determine patient 's initial consult Ottawa Cancer Center cancer diagnosis confirm medical Oncologist initiation anticancer treatment . Follow-up study 12 month patient see time schedule appointment cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
