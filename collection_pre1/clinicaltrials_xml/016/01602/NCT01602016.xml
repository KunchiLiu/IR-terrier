	<brief_title>A Folinic Acid Intervention Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence-based intervention autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) limit . Currently , FDA approve medical therapy address either core ASD symptoms pathophysiological process associate ASD . For example , two FDA approve antipsychotic medication treat ASD indicate symptom associate ASD , core ASD symptom . Based strong preliminary evidence , study aim improve core ASD symptoms folinic acid . Two biological mechanism response intervention propose investigate study . Folate essential B vitamin require normal neurodevelopment . Folinic acid reduce form folate show improve metabolic core symptom associate ASD open-label study large case-series . This study extend preliminary evidence demonstrate clinical efficacy folinic acid double-blind placebo-controlled manner also evaluate biological mechanism associate clinical response . Preliminary evidence efficacy folinic acid two-fold : First , several independent study demonstrate folinic acid intervention improve ASD core symptom ASD patient diagnose cerebral folate deficiency - metabolic disorder primary pathway transport folate across blood-brain barrier dysfunctional . The primary transport pathway folate across blood-brain barrier use folate receptor α ( FRα ) energy dependent endocytosis . A secondary pathway , reduce folate carrier ( RFC ) , transport reduce form folate , folinic acid , across blood-brain barrier . In case-series child ASD cerebral folate deficiency , folinic acid ( 0.5 2 mg/kg/day ) improve communication , social interaction , attention , stereotypical behavior ( 3-6 ) completely ameliorate ASD symptom others ( 6 , 7 ) . The major cause cerebral folate deficiency autoantibody bind FRα interfere ability bind transport folate . Recently , Frye et al . find ( ) autoantibodies FRα present approximately 75 % child ASD , ( b ) intervention folinic acid ( 2mg/kg/day ; max 50mg ) child ASD FRα autoantibody result significant improvement parental rating receptive expressive language , verbal communication , stereotypic behavior , attention compare parental rating child undergo intervention ( wait group ) similar time period . This proposal extend preliminary finding document response folinic acid intervention double-blind placebo-controlled manner test whether FRα autoantibody titer predict response folinic acid intervention . If FRα autoantibody titer find predict response intervention , titer could provide biomarker identify subset child ASD may benefit folinic acid intervention may even predict development ASD symptom high risk sibling presymptomatic period . Second , ratio reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ( GSH/GSSG ) establish measure systemic redox status oxidative stress show three independent case-control study significantly decrease many ASD child . James et al . show 3 month open-label clinical trial intervention folinic acid methyl-B12 significantly improve GSH/GSSG Vineland score expressive language , receptive language , socialization ASD child . Important unanswered question ( ) whether preliminary data confirm large double-blind placebo-controlled study , ( b ) whether redox status folinic acid intervention predict response intervention ( c ) whether improve systemic redox status associate improvement core ASD symptom . This study ass whether folinic acid intervention improve core symptom ASD ( i.e. , communication , socialization , stereotype movement ) associate comorbid symptom ( i.e. , attention ) double-blind placebo control clinical trial . This study address whether improvement core ASD symptom associate intervention relate biomarkers either ( ) biological mechanism propose influence intervention ( i.e. , GSH/GSSG , FRα autoantibody titer ) . Thus , use biomarkers , may possible child ASD optimally respond folinic acid intervention readily identify early diagnosis even pre-symptomatic period . This double blind , placebo-controlled ( DBPC ) study evaluate efficacy Folinic Acid treatment language impair autism spectrum disorder patient age 3-14 year . The study consist single site trial approximatley 48 enter DBPC phase . Subjects male female current prospective diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Language Impairments define CELF , PLS warrant . Phase 1 consist approximately 57children age 3-14 diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder ( define Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ) , approximately 48 child confirm ASD enrol randomize control trial ( RCT ; Phase 2 ) . Enrollment continue need approximately 43 complete Phase 2 . Approximately 40 enroll phase 3 . Initial analysis undertake inspect data error , inconsistency , incomplete information . This include examine data simple frequency table dot plot univariate data scatter plot multi-way dot plot bivariate multivariate data . To summarize bivariate relationship among predictor predictor outcomes , Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient use . For report inferential statistic , regression coefficient along 95 percent confidence interval use extensively quantify degree clinical importance . The primary population Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) population define subject complete least one post treatment primary outcome measure . A secondary analysis perform `` treat '' population define subject least 75 % compliance prescribed medication significantly deviate protocol . To determine whether folinic acid intervention 12-week period improve core symptom autism spectrum disorder Phase 2 , procedure Proc Mixed SAS use fit mixed model analysis covariance . For multisite study , full model response variable language assessment include predictor : intervention , time , autoantibody , intervention time interaction , autoantibody intervention interaction , redox status , redox status time interaction , baseline covariates . However , single site study , number variable model limit due small sample size separate model perform subgroup compare effect treatment various subgroup . The result mixed model determine biomarkers physiological abnormality , autoantibody redox status , predict intervention response . Similar analysis perform secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
