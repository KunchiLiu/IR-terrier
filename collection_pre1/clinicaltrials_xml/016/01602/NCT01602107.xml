	<brief_title>The Effect Pre-operative Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercise Surgical Outcomes Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current study , hypothesize participant physical therapy group demonstrate great improvement pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) function treatment , compare control group . It also expect woman peri-operative physical therapy group show good post-surgical outcome compare control group . Through study investigator also develop test predictive model identify woman SUI benefit physical therapy and/or surgery . Objective 1 : evaluate characteristic predictive success failure PFM training woman SUI . To meet objective , cohort study use . Women SUI recruit prospectively , provide demographic information , undergo clinical evaluation PFM strength , fill International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaires ( ICIQs ) , undergo extensive evaluation continence system use ultrasound imaging . Ultrasound image use measure muscle morphology ( presence extent PFM defect , PFM cross sectional area , urethral sphincter cross sectional area ) , fascial support ( position bladder neck rest Valsalva maneuver ) urethral mobility ( amount excursion acceleration urethra cough ) . A predictive multivariate logistic regression model develop determine whether demographic variable , PFM strength , PFM morphology measure , fascial support urethral mobility measure prior intervention use predict woman SUI cure standardized 12-week physical therapy program aim improving strength , power , endurance motor control PFMs . A secondary objective continue current research aim evaluate effect PFM training morphology function continence system woman SUI . The cohort use meet secondary objective evaluate use repeated-measures design determine whether 12-week physical therapy program result PFM hypertrophy , urethral sphincter hypertrophy , change support urethra measure position bladder neck relative pubic symphysis anorectal angle rest , change motor control measure urethral motion coughing . Objective 2 : determine whether program pre- peri-operative physical therapy aim improving strength motor control PFMs improve surgical outcome relative usual care woman predominant symptom SUI . Women wait surgery treat symptom SUI two hospital site randomize either physical therapy group control group . Women assign physical therapy group receive standardize 12 week program PFM training prior surgery , continue exercise receive surgery , resume exercise surgery . The control group receive usual care , handout describe PFM exercise . The primary outcome study report score patient-oriented ICIQs , complete enter study , twelve week later , surgical follow visit 12 week surgery . The physical therapy group result compare control group . Analysis variance model use determine whether physiotherapy program improve score outcomes 12 week surgery , Chi Square model ass whether cure rate higher woman belong physical therapy compare control group . A secondary objective evaluate characteristic predictive success failure surgical intervention , specifically transvaginal tape ( TVT ) use standard approach and/or obturator approach ( TVT-O ) , woman SUI perform peri-operative PFM training . To meet secondary objective , similar , cohort design use . Women SUI recruit prospectively , provide demographic information describe undergone extensive evaluation continence mechanic describe Objective 1 . Similar description , statistical modeling use predict woman SUI complete alleviation SUI symptoms surgery . In case , overall model also include surgical intervention use patient . Taken together , result study begin direct clinical decision make around delivery appropriate intervention woman SUI , particularly physical therapy TVTand TVT-O surgery . DESCRIPTION OF METHODS AND PROCEDURES ) Study Design Methodology : Subjects Screening All woman age 18 report symptom SUI evaluate urogynaecologist ( Dr. M.A.Harvey Dr. S. Johnston ) Kingston General Hospital ( KGH ) , ( Dr. K. Baker ) Ottawa Hospital , ( Dr. Magali Robert ) Foothills Hospital Calgary ( Dr. V. della Zazzera ) Montfort Hospital Ottawa deem appropriate TVT TVT-O surgery decide pursue option ask physician willing contact investigator . For agree , receive follow-up phone call determine interest participating , appropriate , eligibility . Eligible interested participant instruct complete three-day bladder diary record number daily episode urine leakage experience typical three day period . Volunteers schedule attend baseline evaluation Pelvic Floor Laboratory Queen 's University Dr. Linda McLean 's Pelvic Floor Laboratory University Ottawa . At first visit , eligibility participant confirm base bladder diary result ( must experience least one episode urine leakage three-day diary ) , pad test absence evidence neurological cause pelvic floor muscle dysfunction . Those still eligible height weight record , bladder volume measure use trans-abdominal ultrasound ( US ) imaging . If bladder volume least 250 ml , participant begin standardize pad test ( i.e. , circuit walk stair climb 30 minute , show highly sensitive specific diagnosis urinary incontinence . If bladder volume less 250mL , volunteer ask drink 350mL water wait proper volume attain . In case , volunteer complete study questionnaire describe wait bladder fill . Once bladder fill 250mL , begin test . For test , incontinence pad weigh adhered undergarment . The woman perform standardize circuit walk stair climb 30 minute , time weight pad measure . An increase weight great 1g confirm presence urine leakage confirm participant 's eligibility . If participant deem ineligible point , thank participation withdrawn remainder study . At point , volunteer meet bladder diary pad test requirement undergo urogynecological screen exam research assistant.. This physical screening include palpation rule pelvic mass ( e ) , manual muscle test evaluate PFM strength , sensory reflex test rule neurologic cause incontinence . This constitute last step evaluate participant 's eligibility . If participant evidence pelvic mass neurologic defect , criterion meet , woman enter study . At session , eligible participant undergo three-dimensional ( 3D ) US image assessment pelvic region . Ultrasound image perform first lithotomy position use transvaginal endoprobe evaluate urethral sphincter . Next , use 3D curvilinear transducer , PFMs visualize axial plane participant performs three repetition maximal voluntary contraction . A 2D curvilinear transducer use capture video clip sagittal plane participant performs three repetition Valsalva maneuver , cough . The participant move stand position wide stance allow curvilinear transducer apply perineum . She ask repeat three repetition Valsalva maneuver , three repetition maximal effort cough . This conclude US image test section . If already complete , participant conclude session complete International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaires ( ICIQs ) evaluate incontinence symptom , participant give standard educational sheet describe perform PFM strengthening exercise . They advise contact inform whether randomized physical therapy control group . The entire baseline test take approximately 2.5 hour . Randomization : Participants randomly assign ( 1:1 ) either physical therapy group control group use secure web-based computerize randomization system conceal future randomization . Randomization stratify site use permuted block random size . Participant blind possible study nature , however research assistant perform pre- post-treatment assessment remain blinded group assignment data collection processing . Interventions : A total 400 volunteer randomly assign two experimental group : Physical therapy control group . Physical Therapy Group The woman standardize physical therapy treatment group attend six session 12-week period . Treatments deliver physical therapist post-graduate training urinary incontinence management . Physical therapist train deliver semi-standardized treatment protocol respective physical therapy clinic city Ottawa , Kingston Calgary . In first session , volunteer learn perform proper PFM contraction use manual palpation feedback optimize PFM contraction quality learn contract PFMs task increase intra-abdominal pressure , cough postural perturbation ( i.e. , Knack exercise ) . The woman instruct perform prescribed exercise daily . At 45-minute visit , physical therapist review reinforce proper PFM contraction technique , evaluate PFM strength use modify Oxford scale provide feedback progress , review Knack exercise ( quick contraction PFM high intra-abdominal pressure ) supervise volunteer performs task ensure correct performance . The exercise progress compliance record describe . Control Group Participants control group ask follow recommendation pelvic floor muscle train educational sheet . They ask follow visit report whether attempted PFM exercise , frequency . Post-Intervention/Pre-surgical test Women group return laboratory 12 week baseline test described . To ensure evaluator remain blinded group assignment , woman ask reveal research assistant whether received physical therapy treatment . The pre-surgical testing repeat baseline test procedure manner describe ( i.e. , bladder diary , pad test , US imaging , questionnaire ) , exception neurological assessment initially use determine eligibility perform . After pre-surgical testing , woman physical therapy group instruct continue exercise program visit physical therapist every four week surgery . Women control group advise continue at-home PFM exercise , accord information provide standard educational sheet . Post-surgical intervention Only woman physical therapy group advise continue exercise program start day TVT surgery . Each woman visit physical therapist one week , three week five week surgery ensure perform PFM exercise correctly continue progression PFM exercise accord progress . Post-surgical test All woman return laboratory 12 week surgery re-evaluated research assistant ( still blind group assignment ) use ICIQs pad test . This post-surgical testing last 45 minute . Long-term follow-up test All woman enrol study undergo long-term follow use bladder diary , ICIQs pad test 12 month 2 year post-surgery . The ICIQs administer phone , do research assistant whenever patient attend follow-up visit ( ) order reduce number participant lose follow-up .
