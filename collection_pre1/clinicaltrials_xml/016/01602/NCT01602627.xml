	<brief_title>Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY922 Treating Older Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) AUY922 ( Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 ) single agent administer intravenously ( IV ) once-weekly schedule adult patient 75 year age old advance solid tumor whose disease progress despite standard therapy standard therapy exist . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability treatment AUY922 . II . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile AUY922 , include parent drug potential metabolite . III . To determine efficacy AUY922 elderly patient measurable disease . IV . To evaluate effect geriatric-focused assessment comorbidity functional status toxicity response AUY922 . V. To assess ethical constraint enrollment elderly patient phase I trials . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect therapy AUY922 number circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) . II . To assess change HSP70 induction measure pharmacodynamic effect pre- post-AUY922 sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) explore age-related difference HSP90 inhibition AUY922 compare previous phase I trial . III . To assess change cellular response marker apoptosis pre- post-AUY922 dose peripheral blood include measurement M30 M65 explore age-related difference pharmacodynamics compare patient enrol previous phase I trial . IV . To determine association pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) parameter . V. To determine relationship geriatric-focused assessment comorbidity functional ability toxicity response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
