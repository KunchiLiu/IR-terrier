	<brief_summary>Background : - Small blood vessel ( microvessels ) many different organ affect disease diabetes atherosclerosis . These microvessels may also abnormal people sickle cell disease . Stiffness red blood cell lead problem microvessels heart kidney . However , problem may detect organ severely affect . Researchers want study problem microvessels people without sickle cell disease . Objectives : - To study microvessels heart organs affected sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age sickle cell disease . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - All participant 3 4 hour test study . Participants sickle cell disease pain crisis time enter study may ask test crisis . The repeat test occur least 4 week pain crisis end . - All participant follow test : - Blood draw check kidney liver function , blood test - Measure blood flow brachial ( upper arm ) artery - Heart ultrasound - Ultrasound scan arm muscle study blood flow - Ultrasound scan take vasodilator increase blood flow - Healthy volunteer also magnetic resonance imaging scan . It show blood flow heart . This scan involve another dose vasodilator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease common genetic disease affect African-Americans . It characterize abnormal hemoglobin S , polymerize deoxygenate lead red cell rigidity microvascular flow obstruction . Recurrent episodes ischemia chronic inflammatory state lead ischemia-reperfusion injury multiple vital organ system . Endothelial dysfunction demonstrate patient sickle cell disease new therapy target specifically towards endothelium . Contrast ultrasound non-invasive technique use assess microvascular flow coronary artery disease , diabetes , disease state . We propose use technique sickle cell patient compare myocardial skeletal muscle flow normal control , detect change pain crisis , compare flow abnormality cardiac functional abnormality .</detailed_description>
