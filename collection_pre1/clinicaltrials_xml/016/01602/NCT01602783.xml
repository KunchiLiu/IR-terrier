	<brief_summary>This research conduct test imaging technique may able detect small amount prostate cancer detect standard imaging . Many patient diagnosed prostate cancer undergo surgery remove prostate . After surgery , patient PSA blood test reveals low detectable level PSA . This PSA may produce cancer cell one two location : ( 1 ) near area prostate use , ( 2 ) elsewhere body . If cancer area prostate use , successfully treat radiation area . If cancer elsewhere , radiation helpful . Currently , available scan detect cancer PSA still low . The test use study call [ 11C ] acetate PET screening . [ 11C ] acetate radioactive tracer give vein patient PET scan . The PET scanner detects radioactivity tracer attach cell within body use information create image ( picture ) computer screen . [ 11C ] acetate PET scan show early study detect small amount prostate cancer detect standard imaging test CT scan bone scan . If successful detect small amount prostate cancer , [ 11C ] acetate PET scan help doctor identify patient benefit radiation therapy prostate surgically remove . It also help identify patient small amount prostate cancer part body benefit radiation prostate area . This type PET scan investigational . `` Investigational '' mean scan still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve type PET scan type cancer . The information collect scan determine whether type scan helpful use make decision medical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If decide participate study eligible , undergo single [ 11C ] acetate PET scan . This scan design detect small amount tumor detect CT scan bone scan . On day scan , fast least four hour prior give tracer injection vein . You scan PET scanner . The entire procedure take approximately 2 hour . The investigator would like keep track medical condition complete scan . The investigator would like look information medical record year follow scan see . Checking condition help u understand whether [ 11C ] acetate PET scan helpful patient future .</detailed_description>
