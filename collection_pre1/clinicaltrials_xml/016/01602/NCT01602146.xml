	<detailed_description>Acute physiological consequence ultramarathon run still unknown , particularly woman . Results first study conduct 2009 show large part fatigue induce mountain ultramarathon could attribute central fatigue . Indeed , extreme exercise 24h running , strength loss knee extensor muscle reach -40 % ¾ fatigue explain central deficit peripheral mechanism explain ¼ . Similar result report mountain ultramarathon despite fact several downhill induce number eccentric contraction . As consequence , central fatigue must particularly investigate . For purpose , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) recently validate measure supraspinal central fatigue cortical excitability . We investigate biological consequence neuromuscular fatigue male runner . Data literature suggest amplitude etiology fatigue prolong exercise might gender-dependant . However , physiological data study pair male female level performance shorter distance seem contradictory performance comparison gender relative superiority woman ultra-endurance ascertained . The hypothesis great fatigue resistance ultramarathons woman test . The biological consequence ultramarathon far negligible term inflammatory syndrome complete characterization syndrome extreme exercise yet do . Also , several case renal failure report ultramarathons . Evaluation ultramarathon consequence kidneys necessary prevent serious complication . Finally , consequence ultramarathon link race also train , i.e . prolonged time spend run prepare race . Energy expenditure twice normal one repeat impact may potentially alter bone metabolism best knowledge , study assess effect ultra-endurance run bone tissue , particularly male . The main purpose present project thus quantify supraspinal central fatigue associate change cortical excitability extreme exercise mountain ultramarathon : Ultra-Trail du Mont-blanc , use TMS . The secondary purpose ( ) compare neuromuscular biological alteration induce mountain ultramarathon male female match age level performance , ( ii ) evaluate , biological urine blood sample , consequence mountain ultramarathon kidney ( iii ) investigate hormonal status bone mineral density group male female runner take part type event regularly .</detailed_description>
