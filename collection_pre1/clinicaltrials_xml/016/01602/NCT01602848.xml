	<brief_title>A Patient Centered Intervention Improve Health Reduce Medicaid Costs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Though patient frequent hospital admission comprise small percentage patient , account disproportionate share visit cost . Their substantial use health care resource often result simultaneous presence severe medical social co-morbidities . These high cost case catch attention policy maker , create movement state shift Medicaid patient fee-for-service manage care model `` high risk '' case management program . Such state initiative create impetus hospital health care provider well understand control expenditures high user health service . The work propose application address gap literature use group-randomized trial design use quantitative evaluate outcome . This proposal logical extension previous work : past three year , conduct research improve care coordination patient population via in-depth need assessment , model program development , implementation pilot initiative safety net hospital limit number patient determine feasibility . Most recently , New York City Health Hospitals Corporation ( HHC ) award one seven New York State Department Health Chronic Illness Demonstration Project ( CIDP ) grant $ 5 million span 3 year , expand work enroll intervene similar high-risk patient throughout system . In order evaluate impact CIDP initiative , intervention currently design group-randomized trial track compare health care utilization cost intervention control group use Medicaid claim data . However , provision make contact characterize control group member , survey control group member regard issue depression , social support , behavioral health need , satisfaction current care , leave question intervention component correlate change health service utilization unanswered . The ability evaluation analyze effect important factor anticipate improve innovative care redesign initiative ( e.g. , social support , housing status ) health service utilization thus sharply curtail , limit outcome study derivable administrative claim data . We thus propose conduct in-depth evaluation HHC CIDP enrollees determine whether specific outcome related health , functional status , quality life result patient-centered , intensive care coordination management intervention correlate improve linkage primary care reduce hospitalization emergency department visit . We relate benefit program cost use standard cost-effectiveness analysis technique . Our program model innovative approach , employ Care Management Teams comprise social worker , community base care manager , dedicate clinician work meet patient ' need health care set community . Specific Aim 1 To compare change outcomes related health status , quality life , care satisfaction high-risk intervention patient control use quantitative qualitative method . Associated hypothesis Compared baseline assessment administer time enrollment , 1.1 Intervention patient measurable improvement health status measure SF-12 PHQ-9 12-month follow-up . Enrollees measurable improvement quality life measure Perceived Availability Support scale , CHAOS scale , housing status 12- 24-month follow-up . 1.2 Intervention patient measurable improvement personal satisfaction health care measure PSQ-18 12 24-month follow-up . Specific Aim 2 To determine improvement linkage primary care ( define 3 visit clinic within 12 month ) , reduce use acute care service ( emergency department visit hospital admission ) associate improved health status , quality life , personal satisfaction health care . Associated hypotheses 2.1 Improvements measure health status associate improved linkage primary care reduction use acute care service . 2.2 Improvements measure quality life associate improved linkage primary care reduction use acute care service . 2.3 Improvements measure personal satisfaction associate improved linkage primary care reduction use acute care service . Specific Aim 3 To understand economic impact intervention measure component financial societal cost , perform cost- effectiveness analysis primary secondary outcome . Associated hypotheses 3.1 The overall reduction health care cost meet exceed cost intervention account intervention-related cost . 3.2 The intervention favorable value compare alternative us healthcare resource priority population . 3.2.a . The cost intervention per hospitalization avert ( associate mortality ) favorable . 3.2.b The cost intervention per improvement QALY favorable</detailed_description>
