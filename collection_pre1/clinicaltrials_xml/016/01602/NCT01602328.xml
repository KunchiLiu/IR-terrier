	<brief_summary>Subjects enter study undergone cardiac surgery . Those experience kidney injury within 48 hour surgery enrol study . Once enrol , subject receive single administration AC607 placebo . Kidney recovery evaluate subsequent 30 day death need dialysis evaluate within 90 day dose . After 90 day ( evaluation period ) , subject enter 3-year extension phase study monitor safety long-term outcome ( follow-up period ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy AC607 Treatment Kidney Injury Cardiac Surgery Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll post-cardiac surgery subject ( CABG and/or valve ) laboratory evidence AKI within 48 hr removal cardiopulmonary bypass . Subjects randomly assign ( 1:1 ratio ) treatment single administration AC607 placebo ( approximately 100 subject per group ) . Safety efficacy assessment perform daily post-operative hospital stay day randomize study discharge , 30 day , 90 day study drug administration ( evaluation phase ) . Safety long-term clinical outcome assess 6 , 12 , 24 36 month ( long-term follow-up phase ) .</detailed_description>
