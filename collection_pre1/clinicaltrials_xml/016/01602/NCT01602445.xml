	<brief_summary>The presence clot vein arm and/or legs lung Cancer patient decrease quality life , delay treatment may cause death . The best way avoid new clot give blood thinner clot form , even patient take blood thinner may form blood clot . A major problem difficult know patient form clot receive blood thinner , situation call treatment failure . Several study show blood test measure formation clot , investigator could know patient respond blood thinner . If prove , investigator able apply test patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pro-coagulant Markers Anticoagulant Failure Cancer Patients Risk Recurrence Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic failure cancer patient high risk recurrence Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) may high 20 % risk death recurrent episode pulmonary embolism least 8 % . Studies use pro-coagulant thrombin generation marker support notion cancer associate hypercoagulability state intensify dos anticoagulation may necessary suppress state . Thus , may possible use test , would identify patient respond standard dos anticoagulation . To date , small study evaluate use pro-coagulant marker cancer patient data promising . Our study measure pro-coagulant marker cancer patient risk VTE recurrence determine relationship change level pro-coagulant marker VTE recurrence take anticoagulation low-molecular weight-heparin ( LMWH ) . The evaluation pro-coagulant marker may enable new treatment strategy cancer patient fail initial treatment . Patients stratify risk model develop group validate study . This new approach potential improve recovery patient , reduce death disability due clot vein legs arm and/or lung .</detailed_description>
