	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , dose escalation , phase I study estimate Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) low Recommended Dose Expansion ( RDE ) LJM716 combination trastuzumab patient Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC ) gastric cancer ( MGC ) . The study consist dose escalation part dose expansion part . LJM716 administer intravenously weekly unless less frequent dose regimen every 2 week every 4 week introduce . Patients continue trastuzumab dosing , administer intravenously weekly 2mg/kg . During dose escalation , minimum 15 patient anticipate treated successive cohort . The dose escalation continue MTD/RDE declare . The RDE dose select either MTD dose MTD base safety Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) consideration . Following MTD/RDE declaration , approximately 20 MBC 20 MGC patient enrol separate arm dose expansion part treat MTD/RDE ass safety , tolerability , anti-tumor activity combination .</brief_summary>
