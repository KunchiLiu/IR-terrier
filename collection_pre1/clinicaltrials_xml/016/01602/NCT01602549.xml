	<brief_summary>Gastric empty end-result complex carefully regulate series event follow ingestion meal , dependent subject neurohormonal control . Motilin endogenous peptide , produce mainly duodenum , whose physiological action mediate motilin receptor locate enteric neuron , peripheral terminal vagus , smooth muscle gut . Motilin non-peptide agonist motilin receptor increase gastric empty rate therefore provide potential approach treatment range clinical condition delay gastric empty thought part physiopathology may contributory symptom . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterize degeneration nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones . It affect 1.5 % global population 65 year age . Cardinal symptom comprise bradykinesia , rigidity , rest tremor postural instability . Gastrointestinal dysfunction , include gastroparesis , frequent feature PD affect approximately 90 % patient , cause autonomic dysfunction well adverse effect antiparkinsonian drug therapy . The therapeutic mainstay PD treatment neutral amino acid L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA ) , dopamine prodrug , provide rapid effective symptomatic control motor impairment PD . The primary determinant L-DOPA bioavailability gastric empty ( GE ) ; delay GE slow delivery L-DOPA proximal small intestinal absorption site , increase extent presystemic metabolism , lead slow diminished absorption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effect Repeat Doses GSK962040 Pharmacokinetics L-DOPA Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease Exhibiting Delayed Gastric Emptying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MOT115816 conduct multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo control study investigate ability motilin receptor agonist GSK962040 improve L-DOPA pharmacokinetics ( PK ) enhance gastric empty via motilin receptor agonism . Subjects randomize receive 50 mg GSK962040 placebo 2:1 ratio administer orally daily 7-9 day . The study consist screening/baseline period , treatment period , 14-day post treatment safety follow-up visit . During period participant ask attend study center 5 visit 3 last approximately 5 hour . The duration patient 's participation study screen follow-up visit approximately 7-8 week . For three visit , subject visit clinical unit fast prior take first morning L-DOPA dose . Volunteers undergo complete physical ( include cardiovascular monitoring ( ECG ) , vital sign , blood sample , medical history ) , measurement plasma L-DOPA level , completion patient diary capture amount awake time ( hour ) spend `` '' without dyskinesia , `` '' troublesome dyskinesia , `` '' non-troublesome dyskinesia , `` '' gastric symptom , non-motor motor symptom assessment ( MDS-UPDRS rating scale `` finger tap '' ) measurement gastric empty rate .</detailed_description>
