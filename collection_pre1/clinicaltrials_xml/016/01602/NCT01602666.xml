	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , etoposide , ifosfamide work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .

	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed Radiation Therapy Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localized Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine , measure 3-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate pattern failure , whether dose volume irradiation safely reduce 30.6 Gy whole ventricular-field irradiation ( WVI ) plus 23.4 Gy primary site boost instead 36 Gy craniospinal irradiation ( CSI ) plus primary site boost subgroup child young adult localize nongerminomatous germ cell tumor ( NGGCT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tumor marker criterion ( CSF serum ) confirm complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) induction chemotherapy negative serum cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) tumor marker OR patient le PR induction chemotherapy negative tumor marker undergo second-look surgery find mature teratoma , residual scar fibrosis , fit definition CR/PR second-look surgery . II . To determine , measure 3-year PFS rate pattern failure , whether simplify chemotherapy follow dose-reduced radiation therapy effective treating child young adult localize primary central nervous system ( CNS ) germinoma present serum and/or CSF human chorionic gonadotropin-beta ( hCGβ ) = &lt; 50 mIU/mL . III . To prospectively evaluate longitudinally model cognitive , social , behavioral function child young adult treat reduced radiation dose volume irradiation Stratum 1 ( NGGCT ) dose-reduced radiation therapy Stratum 2 ( Germinoma ) use ALTE07C1 protocol ( This objective assess independently two stratum ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To estimate PFS overall survival ( OS ) distributions patient NGGCT treat 30.6 Gy WVI involved-field radiation therapy ( IFR ) focal boost 54 Gy . II . To estimate PFS OS distribution localized-germinoma patient present serum and/or CSF hCGβ ≤ 50 mIU/mL v serum and/or CSF hCGβ &gt; 50 mIU/mL = &lt; 100 mIU/mL . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord localize primary disease ( nongerminomatous germ cell tumor [ NGGCT ] v germinoma ) . Stratum 1 ( NGGCT ) : Patients receive induction therapy comprise carboplatin IV 15-60 minute day 1 etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1-3 course 1 , 3 , 5 . Patients also receive ifosfamide IV 1 hour etoposide 1-2 hour day 1-5 course 2 , 4 , 6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients responsive disease ( complete [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week . Patients PR , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) normalization tumor level undergo second-look surgery . Patients achieve CR PR second-look surgery undergo radiotherapy . Stratum 2 ( Germinoma ) : Patients receive induction therapy comprise carboplatin IV 15-60 minute day 1 etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients CR continue CR undergo radiotherapy QD 5 day week approximately 4 week . Patients PR , SD , PD normal tumor marker may undergo second-look surgery . Patients find mature teratoma non-viable tumor surgery undergo radiotherapy . Patients PR SD residual disease ( = &lt; 1.5 cm ) suprasellar ( &gt; 0.5 cm ) pineal ( &gt; 1 cm ) involvement normal tumor marker undergo radiotherapy chemotherapy without second-look surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
