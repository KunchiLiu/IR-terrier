	<brief_title>Study Exelon Transdermal Patch Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical study suggest cholinesterase inhibitor ( ChEIs ) exert cognitive benefit chronic use among MCI AD patient . Some study also demonstrate slight treatment benefit person APOE 4 positive . We propose conduct 24-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study ExelonÂ® [ rivastigmine ] transdermal patch 120 aMCI patient one APOE 4 allele . Our preliminary analysis indicate aMCI patient , even convert AD , exhibit increase fMRI activation semantic memory activation task relative at-risk healthy participant increase activation time correlate decline neuropsychological test . In addition , preliminary data indicate ChEI treat aMCI patient demonstrate normalization ( i.e . reduction ) magnitude task-related neural activation time relative untreated group . Furthermore , change fMRI magnitude demonstrate great sensitivity cholinergic modulation change neuropsychological testing .</detailed_description>
