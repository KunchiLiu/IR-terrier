	<brief_summary>Aortic stenosis ( AS ) , narrow aortic valve , common condition require valve surgery develop world . It currently know determines go develop symptom . Exercise testing may able identify patient well severity narrow , limitation . The purpose study compare whether MRI scan exercise test good identify patient AS likely benefit surgery . Design : The investigator measure blood flow heart muscle MRI scan perform exercise test 170 patient AS follow 2 year . Expected outcome : MRI scan accurately identify patient AS need surgery period . Anticipated Health Benefits : improve selection patient AS likely benefit early surgery . This likely reduce death patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical AVR remain universally accepted management symptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS ) . However , best management severe aortic stenosis , absence symptom , remain one controversial area modern Cardiology . Exercise test identify asymptomatic patient AS increase risk , limited specificity . In BHF fund project , investigator identify cardiac MRI measure Myocardial Perfusion Reserve ( MPR ) may novel image biomarker AS . MPR independent predictor aerobic exercise capacity ( peak VO2 ) patient severe AS also inversely related symptomatic status . In multi-centre , observational , cohort outcome study , investigator follow 175 patient asymptomatic moderate severe AS minimum 12 month , determine whether MPR well predictor outcome exercise testing , elucidate mechanism contribute symptom development AS establish determinant MPR AS . Patients recruit tertiary Cardiac centre , well regional hospital . Comprehensive CMR adenosine stress determine LV mass function , focal diffuse fibrosis MPR ; cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( peak VO2 exercise symptom ) ; rest exercise echocardiography ( AS severity , valve compliance ) NT-proBNP perform . The study run conjunction Glasgow CTU . Investigations analyse blind patient status data enter validated database . Statistical analysis perform supervision Prof. Ian Ford . The relationship MPR exercise test 1-year outcome analyse use logistic regression . Paired comparison specificity two approach dataset carry use McNemar 's test . The primary hypothesis MPR good predictor adverse outcome exercise testing .</detailed_description>
