	<brief_summary>The purpose study test investigational vaccine know `` VAX161C . '' An `` investigational '' vaccine one license commercial use United States ( US ) US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . VAX161C vaccine influenza A virus subtype H5N1 avian influenza virus ( bird flu ) . In study , subject receive VAX161C vaccine one six dos see dose best . VaxInnate want find safe dos vaccine well tolerated people receive . To measure effective type vaccine , VaxInnate test ability body develop immune response , mean body recognize defend influenza virus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTING Immediate Complaints Immediate complaint vaccination symptom solicit observed two hour ( +30 minute ) vaccination Day 0 vaccination Day 21 . Solicited immediate complaint group local ( injection site ) complaints general complaint ( Appendix A : Solicited Local General Vaccination Reactogenicity Symptoms ) . Solicited local ( injection site ) complaint include redness ( erythema ) , swell induration , pain , bruise solicit general complaint include fever , headache , fatigue , joint pain , muscle ache , shiver ( chill ) , increase sweating . Each local general complaint grade severity use guideline provide Appendix B : Local Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale Appendix C : General Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale . The data report `` immediate complaint '' presume related investigational product . These finding NOT additionally record AEs unless meet criterion set forth Section 8.3 . Any symptom offer study subject 2 hour ( +30 minute ) vaccination record AE section CRF . Vaccine Reactogenicity The set local general complaint , complaint reasonably anticipate occur result receipt investigational product include Reactogenicity Memory Aid list Appendix A : Solicited Local General Vaccination Reactogenicity Symptoms . These solicit study staff conjunction review Memory Aid 7 day follow vaccination Day 0 21 . The severity grade use grade scale provide Appendix B : Local Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale Appendix C : General Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale finding record CRFs . Symptoms Reactogenicity Memory Aid report `` reactogenicity '' presume related investigational product . These complaint NOT additionally record AEs unless meet criterion set forth Section 8.3 . Definitions use grade reactogenicity severity include Reactogenicity Memory Aid form . Safety Oversight VaxInnate VaxInnate study Sponsor . Sponsor responsibility include creation oversight protocol development , submission Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application FDA , monitor ensure Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) conduct study , submission annual final study report FDA . Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) The SMC consist 3 independent medical monitor associate study . The Principal Investigator ( ) , VaxInnate Medical Monitor , Data Manager provide information SMC . The SMC ass safety information part study determine safe escalate next dose level . The SMC meeting convene safety data dos collect subject enrol part 1 late part 2 . The SMC review safety data make recommendation continue next part study . The safety data SMC 's recommendation forward CBER review agreement . The SMC also meet ad hoc basis review adverse event safety relate issue . If safety issue occur would halt study ( Section 4.5 ) , IRB FDA notify . ANALYTICAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Data Entry Management Subject screening/enrollment document use electronic master subject log . This log capture follow information : subject number ; initial ; date screen/enroll ; , reason enrol . In study VAX161B , CRFs utilize Smart Pen TM , digital pen technology , use gather originally-captured data . Therefore , CRFs serve source documentation protocol procedures assessment , except concomitant medication , adverse event , `` Symptom Assessments '' obtain subject-completed memory aid ( MEMA CRF ) . For required procedure assessment , collect data record onto logs memory aid source documentation . This data transcribe onto CRF study staff . Health Decisions ' electronic data management system use create , modify , maintain , archive , retrieve , transmit study data . The Investigator remain responsible accuracy adequacy data enter onto CRFs . Data monitor described section 10.1 . Under direction clinical monitor , CRFs source document verify , appropriate process . Upon data processing , query may generate sent Investigator clarification correction . The Investigator address query resolution verify clinical monitor . The database `` soft-locked '' analysis subject ' data enter data query resolve Day 42 ( ± 2 ) immunogenicity sample test . Data Analysis Additional detail analysis provide Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) Clinical Study Report ( CSR ) . This plan include detail handle miss data , applicable , unused spurious data . Deviations SAP report CSR . The SAP finalize study completion . If discrepancy protocol SAP , SAP take precedence . Sample Size Power For purpose assess safety immunogenicity VAX161C vaccine total 250 subject divide 6 dose group ratio 1:2:2:2:2:1 . Groups 50 subject choose 2.5 , 4 , 6 8 µg dos , anticipate safe immunogenic dose range VAX161C . Groups 25 subject choose 1 12 µg dose group . Based previous finding similar vaccine , anticipate 1 µg group serve `` placebo '' group . The purpose 12 µg group assess upper limit safety immunogenicity . The sample size study ( 50 subject key vaccine dose 25 subject control ( 1 µg group ) select provide robust initial safety database well information dose-related immune response . Safety Analysis All subject receive least one dose vaccine consider enrol included post-dosing safety analysis ( safety population ) . The safety outcome occurrence solicit complaint ( identify Section 8.2 ) seven day receive vaccine . These symptom collect memory aid information collect clinic visit . All symptom grade accord severity . Response vaccine categorize local ( arm pain , redness , bruising , etc . ) systemic ( headache , muscle ache , fatigue , etc . ) symptom . Local systemic reaction vaccine dose group compare 1 µg group two-sided Fisher 's exact test . Laboratory test WBC LFTs collect vaccination also analyze look difference pre- post-vaccination across vaccine format . We compare types severity symptom laboratory result base vaccine construct . Proportions report endpoint vaccine group calculate analyzed use upper boundary two-tailed 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) compare 1 µg group . In addition , frequency percent subject vaccine group report solicit complaint laboratory finding tabulate present 2-sided 95 % confidence interval . A chi-square test may use test whether observed proportion differ expect proportion across dosage group . Immune Response Analysis Sera collect Screening , Days 21 ( prior vaccination0 , 42 ( ±2 ) 180 ( ±10 ) analyze determination HAI , MN assay , serum anti-HA ELISA serum anti-flagellin ELISA . The result determination evaluate follow : - Calculation geometric mean pre- post-vaccination HAI , MN assay , anti-HA , anti-flagellin serum antibody titer treatment group . - Change pre- post-vaccination geometric mean HAI , MN anti-HA , anti-flagellin serum antibody titer treatment group - Seroconversion rate base HAI response define percentage subject pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:10 post vaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 pre-vaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 minimum four-fold rise post-vaccination HI antibody titer ) . - Proportion subject HAI , MN , anti-HA anti-flagellin serum antibody titer vaccination treatment group . Statistical comparison treatment group provide . GMTs compare one-way ANOVA log10-transformed titer report GMT ratio 95 % CIs , calculate log10 scale transform . Proportions subject achieve seroconversion dose determine two-sided Fisher 's exact test . Exact CIs report proportional endpoint . Efficacy Analysis The current protocol design evaluate efficacy VAX161C . CLINICAL MONITORING AND ADMINISTRATION Disposition Data A CRF provide enrol study subject . Data collect completion experimental procedure require protocol record subject 's chart source documentation . This data transcribe onto CRF study staff . All data enter CRFs source documentation form laboratory print out entry subject 's chart . The Investigator remain responsible accuracy adequacy data enter CRFs . Under direction clinical monitor , CRFs source data verify process . Upon data processing , query may generate sent Investigator clarification correction . The Investigator address query resolution verify clinical monitor . Once CRFs complete query resolve , subject ' CRFs may lock .</detailed_description>
