	<brief_summary>Many school child Kenya infect plasmodia helminth specie risk coinfection . It suggest immune response evoke helminth infection may modify immune response plasmodia specie consequently alter infection disease risk . However , study conduct date typically cross-sectional produce conflicting result , need longitudinal study well understand clinical consequence individual harbour coinfection . This study aim investigate impact intensive ( every 3 month ) anthelminthic treatment versus annual treatment risk clinical malaria immune response among school child age 5-14 year Western Province . Specifically , study aim investigate impact intensive anthelminthic treatment ( ) incidence clinical malaria school child , assess use active case detection ; ( ii ) prevalence density Plasmodium spp . infection , use repeat cross-sectional survey ; ( iii ) malaria helminth specific immune response . The study hypothesis intensive anthelminthic treatment among child infect either Ascaris lumbricoides hookworm modifies human host immune response plasmodia helminth infection , therefore alters risk Plasmodium infection clinical disease . This individually randomise trial recruit 1,450 child age 5-14 year find infect either Ascaris lumbricoides hookworm specie . Recruited child randomize receive albendazole treatment either every three month annually monitor periodic surveillance clinical malaria episodes 18 month . In addition , blood sample collect sub-sample child screen malaria specific immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G1 IgG3 helminth specific IgE , IgG2 , IgG4 IgM . Cell culture supernatant assay interferon ( IFN ) -γ , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α , interleukin ( IL ) -10 , IL-5 , IL-4 IL-2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This individual randomized , single-blind trial evaluate impact intensive versus annual anthelminthic treatment incidence clinical malaria healthy school child . The target population include child attend primary school western Kenya . The accessible population include child attend participate primary school standard 1-7 western Kenya . The unit analysis individual child . Children inform consent assent screen helminth infection child find infect either Ascaris lumbricoides hookworm specie recruit study . These child randomize one two group , receive either albendazole treatment every three month albendazole start study placebo every three month thereafter .
