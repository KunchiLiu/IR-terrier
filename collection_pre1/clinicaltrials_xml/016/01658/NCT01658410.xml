	<detailed_description>Background : Although select cardiac surgery perform off-pump , vast majority cardiac surgical procedure today perform support cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Blood cardioplegia use protect heart aortic cross-clamping . However , negative effect myocardial hypoxia surgery often aggravate ischemia/reperfusion injury . In addition , cardiopulmonary bypass lead inflammatory response include endothelial cell activation . Comparable reperfusion injury follow acute myocardial infarction resolve percutaneous coronary intervention , microcirculatory impairment observe cardiac surgery may cause endothelin 1 ( ET-1 ) . ET-1 potent vasoconstrictor peptide upregulated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury . Short-term administration selective ETA receptor blocker BQ-123 find safe pilot study include patient acute myocardial infarction . Patients posterior-wall STE-ACS ( n=57 ) randomly assign receive intravenous BQ-123 400nmol/minute placebo 60 minute , start immediately prior primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . No side branch occlusion , bleed complication severe systemic hypotensive episode occur patient alive 30 day . Hypothesis : Acute local ETA receptor blockade intracoronary administer BQ-123 reduces myocardial injury . Methods : BQ-123 administered patient undergo on-pump aorto-coronary bypass grafting leave anterior descend coronary artery use leave inner mammary artery graft least one vein graft . After 1:1 randomized pilot safety-phase 30 patient administer half dose , 90 subject randomize receive 15Âµmol BQ-123 dissolve NaCl 0.9 % placebo ( NaCl 0.9 % ) administer intracoronarily combination cardioplegia double-blind manner . The primary endpoint enzymatic infarct size assess area curve myocard specific creatine kinase-MB isoform ( CK-MB ) . Left ventricular ejection fraction , diastolic dysfunction , perioperative echocardiography , postoperative level myeloperoxidase matrixmetalloproteinase-9 activity well MACE serve secondary endpoint . Clinical perspective : The implementation BQ-123 add-on pharmacologic therapy cardiac surgery perform use cardiopulmonary bypass could lead improved tissue reperfusion reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury , potentially impact clinical long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
