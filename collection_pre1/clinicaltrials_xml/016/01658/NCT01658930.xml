	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma , squamous , adenosquamous cancer cervix . Diagnosis make LEEP , cone cervical biopsy review confirmed local reference gynecological pathologist . Patient classify lowrisk earlystage cervical cancer . These patient include : • FIGO Stage IA2 [ FIGO Annual Report , 2009 ] , define : evidence disease microscopy ; patient underwent LEEP cone : histologic evidence depth stromal invasion &gt; 3.0 ≤ 5.0 mm base local reference pathologist 's measurement LEEP cone specimen ; histologic evidence lateral extension ≤ 7.0 mm base local reference pathologist 's measurement LEEP cone specimen ; negative margin ( patient positive margin consider IB1 , see ) patient underwent cervical biopsy : radiologic evidence le 50 % stromal invasion base pelvic MRI • FIGO Stage IB1 [ FIGO Annual Report , 2009 ] favorable ( low risk ) feature , define : measure stromal invasion lateral extension meet criterion IA2 ( see ) positive margin ; evidence disease clinical exam ; lesion must clinically measure ≤ 20 mm evidence disease microscopy ; patient underwent LEEP cone : histologic evidence depth stromal invasion 5.110 mm and/or lateral extension 7.120.0 mm base local reference pathologist 's measurement LEEP cone specimen patient underwent cervical biopsy : radiologic evidence le 50 % stromal invasion base pelvic MRI lateral extension ≤ 20 mm base clinical exam radiologic image . In addition criterion maximal stromal invasion ≤ 10 mm , lesion must large 20 mm dimension assessment method ( MRI , clinical histological exam ) . To ensure patient meet criterion , investigator may need sum lesion measurement biopsy method evaluate plane . Patients eligible irrespective presence absence lymphvascular space involvement ( LVSI ) . Physical examination , rectovaginal examination visualization cervix speculum colposcopic examination do initial diagnostic procedure ( LEEP , cone biopsy ) prior randomization . Chest xray CT scan chest AND pelvic MRI* do initial diagnostic procedure ( LEEP , cone biopsy ) prior randomization . The CT 16 slice ( high ) helical scanner . Oral intravenous contrast prefer ( unless contraindication use contrast ) scan obtain portal phase slice thickness 5mm low Pelvic MRI perform 1.5 3 Tesla magnet pelvic phasedarray coil . The MR pulse sequence consist T1 gradient echo axial plane 5 mm slice thickness fast spin echo axial , sagittal , coronal plane 4 mm slice thickness . The short axis ( perpendicular tumour 's long axis ) 3 mm slice thickness require best plane show maximum thickness stromal invasion . Use antiperistaltic agent mandatory intravenous use gadolinium diffusionweighted imaging ( DWI ) optional . * Note : pelvic MRI optional patient stage IA2 disease underwent LEEP cone . After consideration patient 's medical history , physical examination laboratory testing , patient must suitable candidate surgery define attend physician / investigator . Patients must desire preserve fertility . Patients fluent English French must willing complete Quality Life Questionnaire . The baseline assessment must complete within 6 week prior randomization . Inability ( illiteracy English French , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . As additional GCIG group join study , translation questionnaire may add . Patients fluent English French reside Canada United Kingdom must agree participate economic evaluation component trial complete Health Economics Questionnaire . Similarly , patient fluent English French accrue GCIG group participate economic evaluation must willing complete Health Economics Questionnaires . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrolment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Surgery do within 20 week initial diagnosis ( NO EXCEPTIONS ) . The 20week period include time require diagnosis , referral , diagnostic staging , randomization schedule surgical procedure . Patients must ≥ 18 year old . Patients FIGO 1A1 disease [ FIGO Annual Report , 2009 ] . History malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour , Hodgkin 's lymphoma nonHodgkin 's lymphoma curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . Patients evidence lymph node metastasis preoperative imaging histology . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients pregnant .</criteria>
