	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle dysfunction common impaires exercise capacity patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Exercise training main component treatment COPD . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) successful COPD patient unable perform exercise training . The NMES positive effect peripheral muscle function , exercise capacity breathlessness activity daily live COPD patient abnormal body composition dyspneic leave home . A nonrandomized uncontrolled study show application NMES home improve exercise capacity patient better-preserved muscle mass . Evidence preliminary study without apply sham NMES reveal NMES apply complementary ambulatory respiratory rehabilitation program increase quadriceps strength , quality life six minute walk distance severe severe patient . Despite documented benefit NMES COPD patient , place NMES adjunct pulmonary rehabilitation COPD patient able regular endurance strength train unknown . Therefore , purpose study compare effect NMES plus quadriceps muscle training ( NMES group ) sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle training ( control group ) muscle function , dyspnea , fatigue , exercise capacity , health relate quality life , activity daily live , self-efficacy patient COPD eligible able participate endurance training .</detailed_description>
