	<brief_title>HEART Camp : Promoting Adherence Exercise Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective prospective randomize two-group repeat measure experimental design determine efficacy HEART ( Heart Failure Exercise Resistance Training ) Camp behavioral exercise training intervention long-term adherence exercise 18 month patient HF . A sample size 246 subject heart failure recruit 3 year period . All subject receive cardiopulmonary exercise test 9 supervise exercise training session 3 week run-in period prior randomization . Subjects complete 6 9 training session randomize HEART Camp Intervention group ( HC ) standard care ( SC ) exercise group . The HC intervention group receive cognitive-behavioral strategy address intervention component knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , behavioral self-management skill social support . The SC group provide access exercise facility regular facility staff 18 month study period . Our central hypothesis HC group significantly well adherence exercise 18 month . We test hypothesis follow Specific Aims : Aim 1 . To evaluate effect HEART Camp adherence exercise ( measure accelerometry self-report ) ; Aim 2 . To evaluate component HEART Camp intervention mediate effect intervention adherence ; Aim 3 . To evaluate effect HEART Camp specific health outcome ; Aim 4 . To explore selected demographic variable ( race , gender , age ) potential moderator effect HEART Camp intervention adherence ; Aim 5 . To explore perception experience contextualize exercise adherence .</detailed_description>
