	<brief_title>Haemorrhage Alleviation With Tranexamic Acid- Intestinal System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acute gastrointestinal ( GI ) haemorrhage one common gastrointestinal emergency . It important cause mortality morbidity high , middle low income country . The common cause upper GI haemorrhage peptic ulcer , oesophageal varix erosive mucosal disease , although relative frequency different cause varies different country . Acute upper GI haemorrhage account around 50,000 hospital admission year UK case fatality 10 % . The incidence high among disadvantage social group . Lower GI haemorrhage account 15,000 hospital admission year case fatality 10 % 20 % . Upper GI haemorrhage also common medical emergency low middle income country . Patients usually young poor source bleed often oesophageal varix . Fibrinolysis may play important pathological role GI haemorrhage due premature breakdown haemostatic plug sit mucosal injury . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) synthetic derivative amino acid lysine inhibit fibrinolysis block lysine binding site plasminogen . It widely use treatment know safety profile . There reliable evidence TXA reduce blood transfusion surgical patient . A systematic review include 65 trial show TXA reduces probability blood transfusion 39 % ( RR=0.61 , 95 % CI 0.53 0.70 ) compare control . The effect TXA risk thromboembolic event surgical patient remain uncertain , although evidence increase risk . The CRASH-2 trial show administration TXA significantly reduce death due bleeding ( RR=0.85 , 95 % CI 0.76 0.96 ) , all-cause mortality ( RR=0.91 , 95 % CI 0.85 0.97 ) trauma patient significant extra-cranial bleeding , increase vascular occlusive event . A systematic review conduct investigator TXA GI bleed identify nine randomised trial include total 1721 patient . Although statistically significant reduction risk death patient treat TXA ( RR=0.66 , 95 % CI 0.47 0.93 ) , estimate imprecise overall quality trial poor . Furthermore , three trial conduct widespread use therapeutic endoscopy proton pump inhibitor even aggregate trial small assess effect TXA clinical important outcome thromboembolic event . For reason , effectiveness safety TXA GI haemorrhage uncertain currently formal recommendation use treatment GI bleeding . AIM : The HALT-IT trial determine effect TXA mortality , morbidity ( re-bleeding , non-fatal vascular event ) , blood transfusion , surgical intervention health status patient acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage . PRIMARY OUTCOME : The primary outcome death hospital within 28 day randomisation ( cause-specific mortality also record ) . SECONDARY OUTCOMES : 1 . Re-bleeding 2 . Need salvage surgery radiological intervention 3 . Blood transfusion - blood blood component unit transfuse 4 . Thromboembolic event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis ) 5 . Other adverse medical event ( include renal failure , significant cardiac event , respiratory failure , hepatic failure , sepsis , pneumonia , seizure ) 6 . Functional status measure use Katz Index Independence Activities Daily Living 7 . Time spend intensive care unit 8 . Length stay hospital 9 . Patient status ( death , hospital readmission ) 12 month ascertain appropriate database available recruit country TRIAL DESIGN : A pragmatic , randomise , double blind , placebo control trial among 8,000 patient clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding DIAGNOSIS AND INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Adults acute significant upper low gastrointestinal bleeding . The diagnosis significant bleed clinical may include patient hypotension , tachycardia , likely need transfusion , urgent endoscopy surgery . The fundamental eligibility criterion responsible clinician 's 'uncertainty ' whether use tranexamic acid particular patient gastrointestinal bleeding . If clinician believe clear indication , clear contraindication , tranexamic acid use , particular patient randomise . There pre-specified exclusion criterion . TEST PRODUCT , REFERENCE THERAPY , DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION : A load dose tranexamic acid ( 1 gram intravenous injection ) placebo ( sodium chloride 0.9 % ) give soon possible randomisation follow intravenous infusion 3 gram 24 hour placebo ( sodium chloride 0.9 % ) . SETTING : This trial coordinate London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Clinical Trials Unit ( University London ) conduct hospital low , middle high income country . DURATION OF TREATMENT AND PARTICIPATION : The first dose give immediately randomisation maintenance dose give immediately load dose 24 hour . Participation end discharge randomise hospital , death 28 day post randomisation whichever occur first . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION : All patient randomly assign one treatment analyse together ( regardless whether complete received treatment ) intention treat basis .</detailed_description>
