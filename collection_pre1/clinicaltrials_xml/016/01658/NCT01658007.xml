	<brief_summary>The investigator want learn treat relapsed/refractory lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma drug call sirolimus . The investigator use sirolimus along cancer drug often give patient relapse leukemia lymphoma . The main purpose study determine sirolimus give safely combination standard drug use treat relapse lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Of Sirolimus Plus Multiagent Chemotherapy For Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You receive drug sirolimus addition standard chemotherapy drug . Just like original cancer treatment , relapse leukemia/lymphoma treatment divide different part . You get sirolimus first two part : 1 . Re-induction : We give chemotherapy drug try put cancer back remission , mean cancer cell find bone marrow sample ( leukemia ) image study ( lymphoma ) . From start finish , part therapy last 35 day . On study , take drug sirolimus daily addition normal re-induction chemotherapy drug . You swallow liquid sirolimus must take food . You take sirolimus three time first day two time day re-induction . Altogether , schedule re-induction : - Sirolimus mouth start 7 day standard re-induction start , continue every day day 28 - Mitoxantrone vein day 1 2 - Vincristine vein day 3 , 10 , 17 24 - Dexamethasone vein mouth day 1-5 15-19 - PEG-asparaginase* day 3 17 - IT Methotrexate give spinal fluid day 1 ( patient ) day 8,29 ( cancer find spinal fluid ) - IT Triples give spinal fluid day 8,15,22,29 ( cancer find spinal fluid ) ( If allergic reaction PEG-asparaginase , may give 6 dos Erwinia L-asparaginase instead ) 2 . Consolidation : We give drug continue kill cancer cell body prevent come back . From start finish , part therapy last 63 day ( could longer interrupt treatment low blood count , need wait come ) . On study , take drug sirolimus daily addition normal consolidation chemotherapy drug . You take sirolimus three time first day two time day consolidation . Altogether , schedule consolidation : - Sirolimus mouth start 7 day consolidation start , continue every day day 56 . - Cyclophosphamide vein day 1 29 - Cytarabine vein skin day 1-4 , 8-11 , 29-32 , 36-39 - 6-mercaptopurine mouth day 1-14 , 29-42 - PEG-asparaginase* vein day 15 43 - Vincristine vein day 15 43 - It Methotrexate spinal fluid Days 1 29 3 . After complete re-induction consolidation , doctor determine next step treatment . This depend doctor . It part study . This research include re-induction consolidation portion treatment ( 1 2 , ) . If already do re-induction , enter study consolidation . In addition regular test procedure do check cancer study , also take additional blood sample monitor level sirolimus blood ( order adjust dose ) also take blood sample find certain marker blood might indicate sirolimus suppose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age : Patients must &lt; 30 year age time enrollment Diagnosis Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LL ) Histology : Bprecursor Tcell Disease status : first great relapse OR primary disease refractory two prior induction attempt Patients active relapse ( &gt; 5 % bone marrow blast ALL , detectable disease image CT and/or PET scan LL ) without prior reinduction attempt eligible induction ( block 1 ) therapy follow consolidation ( block 2 ) therapy Patients document history relapse receive alternative induction therapy eligible consolidation ( block 2 ) therapy Patients CNS involvement eligible induction block intensify intrathecal therapy . Those enrol postinduction consolidation block must clear CNS blast time enrollment study . ( See Appendix I method evaluate traumatic lumbar puncture . ) Performance status Karnofsky &gt; /= 50 patient &gt; 10 year age OR Lansky &gt; /= 50 child &lt; /= 10 year age ( see Appendix II ) . Oral medication Patient must able consume oral medication form solution nasogastric tube place administration medication . Prior Therapy Patients relapse receive standard ALL maintenance chemotherapy require waiting period entry onto study . Patients relapse therapy standard ALL maintenance therapy must recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study , unless deem stable irreversible investigator . Recovery define toxicity grade &lt; 2 defined Common Toxicity Criteria Version ( CTCAE ) 4.0 , unless otherwise specify Inclusion Exclusion criterion . Cytotoxic chemotherapy : At least 7 day must elapse prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen initiation treatment sirolimus trial , include administration treatment dose corticosteroid ( physiologic replacement adrenal insufficiency allow ) Hydroxyurea : patient peripheral blast may receive hydroxyurea first dose cytotoxic chemotherapy cytoreduction . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 14 day last dose longacting growth factor ( e.g . Neulasta ) 7 day shortacting growth factor . Biologic ( antineoplastic ) agent : At least 7 day last dose biologic agent donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss study chair . Immunotherapy : At least 6 week since completion type immunotherapy , e.g . tumor vaccine . Monoclonal antibody : At least 3 halflives since prior therapy monoclonal antibody .
