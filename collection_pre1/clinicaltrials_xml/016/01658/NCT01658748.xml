	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether deep brain stimulation basolateral nucleus ( BLn ) amygdala , side brain , safely reduce symptom post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) combat veteran whose condition improve despite extensive treatment currently available medication psychotherapy intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Deep Brain Stimulation Amygdala Treatment-Refractory Combat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For pilot feasibility study , combat veteran whose PTSD associate severe symptomatic suffer functional impairment , despite treatment currently available pharmacological psychotherapeutic treatment , recruit clinic large , academically affiliated VA facility . An extensive screening extend baseline study psychiatrist neurosurgeon conduct use standard interview clinical rating scale . Eligible subject require cohabit significant willing participate safety function monitor throughout study . After successful completion baseline eligibility requirement , comprehensive neuropsychological testing perform , structural MRI FDG PET/CT amygdala , insula medial Prefrontal cortex . PET/CT perform analyzed nuclear medicine specialist collaborator familiar type image research . Six consent subject meet eligibility criterion receive bilateral basolateral nucleus amygdala ( BlnA ) implantation Medtronic Activa Primary Cell ( PC ) implantable deep brain stimulator system ( purchased VA Merit Review Grant ) functional neurosurgeon specialized procedure . This do 3-4 day inpatient stay VA Greater Los Angeles Neurosurgical Service . After month weekly safety monitoring stimulators , subject hospitalize 1 day Neurology Service 's electroencephalography ( EEG ) telemetry unit , care supervision epilepsy specialist neurologist co-investigator study , stimulator initiation . Stimulator setting adjust study clinical neurophysiologist patient monitor study neurologist psychiatrist . Only stimulator setting cause epileptiform discharge , potentially significant adverse psychiatric medical ( e.g. , blood pressure , heart rate ) change use subsequent long-term follow-up . After EEG telemetry safety check , subject randomize ( 3/3 ) either stimulators turn ( Week 0 ) , 3 month later ( week 12 ) . This staggered onset double-blind design use DBS trial psychiatry . After week 0 , next 2 year , subject follow regular interval ( weekly 5 month , monthly 7 month , quarterly 12 month ) psychiatrist , neurosurgeon , neurologist neurophysiologist conduct extensive battery psychiatric neurological testing ( include periodic EEG recording ) , well significant interview , stimulator setting adjust base standardized rating scale outcome adverse effect optimize treatment outcome . The principal study hypothesis symptomatic functional benefit chronic stimulation outweigh risk adverse-effects , symptomatic improvement great , without unacceptable adverse effect , subject week 0 , compare week 12 stimulator initiation . Neuropsychological testing repeat 6 month stimulation ass change cognitive function . Functional neuroimaging PET/CT repeat year stimulation ass change activity brain region know function abnormally PTSD .</detailed_description>
