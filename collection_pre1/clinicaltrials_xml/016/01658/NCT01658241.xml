	<brief_summary>This study look effect Panobinostat , investigational treatment , cancer cell patient Hodgkin lymphoma ( cancer immune system specific Hodgkin/Reed Sternberg Cells ) , T-cell lymphoma ( cancer immune system many T lymphocyte ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia prolymphocytic leukaemia ( immune system many lymphocyte blood stream ) , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( immune system many plasma cell B lymphocytes ) myeloma ( cancer plasma cell ) . Panobinostat new drug lead disease improvement patient Hodgkin lymphoma , certain type T-cell lymphoma , myeloma B cell lymphoma . Not patient benefit panobinostat . The researcher wish look effect panobinostat cancer cell . The aim project find patient disease likely respond treatment panobinostat future see particular feature patient cancer affect likelihood way individual respond panobinostat . Panobinostat oral medication ( take mouth ) effect way cancer cell normal cell make protein . Panobinostat use several clinical trial around world . The large trial generally fewer 200 patient Hodgkin lymphoma , cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , myeloma one five one three patient significant improvement disease . Researchers look sample tumour treatment treatment . This one first study look cancer cell change follow treatment drug . It unusual require repeat biopsy participant 's tumour . Panobinostat consider experimental ( investigational ) drug approve regulatory authority ( Food Drug Administration , FDA USA Therapeutics Goods Administration , TGA , Australia ) treat type cancer . Therefore , Panobinostat approve treat patient diagnose refractory relapsed cancer . A total 30 patient one disease list enrol Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre . It expect take 2 3 year recruit 30 patient average patient take part six eighteen month . This time could shorter long depend well treatment work individual . While trial take 4 year complete , science study may take long .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven lymphoproliferative neoplasm belong one follow disease category relapse incomplete response conventional therapy , patient consider intolerant conventional chemotherapy conventional therapy consider appropriate . Hodgkin lymphoma Multiple myeloma ( patient must expose otherwise unable tolerate lenalidomide bortezomib ) . Peripheral Tcell lymphoma ( include angioimmunoblastic lymphoma PTCL Not otherwise specify ) Cutaneous TCell lymphoma [ Mycosis fungoides , Sézary syndrome , Primary cutaneous gammadelta T cell lymphoma , Lymphomatoid papulosis , Subcutaneous panniculitislike T cell lymphoma Alpha/Beta lambda/delta type CD30+ Anaplastic large cell lymphoma ] Cutaneous Bcell lymphoma [ Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma skin , Primary cutaneous follicle cell lymphoma , Primary cutaneous DLBCL , leg type ] Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Bprolymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL prolymphocytic transformation ) Tprolymphocytic leukaemia 2 . The lymphoma need accessible , convenient safe ( &lt; 5 % risk bleed serious event ) biopsy least one follow sample type multiple occasion stipulate study protocol : Peripheral blood sample ( absolute peripheral circulate lymphoma cell &gt; 2x109/L ) . Bone marrow biopsy ( &gt; 30 % marrow involvement lymphoma ) . Clinically apparent cutaneous lymphoma amenable skin biopsy ( patient cutaneous involvement blood stream involvement must agree biopsy skin addition peripheral blood sample ) . Clinically accessible lymph node extranodal disease amenable core biopsy . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year 4 . ECOG performance status score 02 screening . 5 . Life expectancy ≥12 week 6 . Patient follow laboratory value within 3 week start study drug ( lab may repeat , need , obtain acceptable value failure screen conclude ) ANC ≥ 1.5x109 /L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109 /L ( unless due marrow involvement ) AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except gilbert 's syndrome , case ≤ 3 x ULN require ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum potassium , magnesium , phosphorus , sodium , total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ionize calcium within normal limit 7 . Patient ability swallow capsule . 8 . Sexually active patient ( men woman child bear potential ) agree use double barrier method contraception course study treatment period ( 13 cycle ) 3 month complete study treatment . WOCBP define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy postmenapausal ( menses ) least 12 consecutive month . 9 . Males female partner childbearing potential must agree use medically reliable method prevent conception throughout study 30 day follow date last dose . 10 . Mentally competent able understand information give provide inform consent clinical aspect study well demand correlative study associate tumour biopsy . 1 . Concomitant use ( within 28 day first biopsy ) anticancer therapy include radiation therapy 2 . Exposure histone deacetylase inhibitor within precede 4 week . 3 . Patient receive chemotherapy investigational drug undergone major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug whose side effect therapy resolve ≤ grade 1 ( except grade 2 neuropathy ) . 4 . Current involvement ( medication deliver within 28 day first biopsy ) study alternative investigational agent . 5 . Impaired cardiac function include one following : LVEF &lt; low limit institutional normal , determine ECHO MUGA Obligate use permanent cardiac pacemaker Congenital long QT syndrome History presence ventricular tachyarrhythmias Resting bradycardia define &lt; 50 beat per minute QTcF &gt; 450 msec screen ECG Complete leave bundle branch block , bifasicular block Any clinically significant ST segment and/or Twave abnormality Presence unstable atrial fibrillation ( ventricular rate &gt; 100 bpm ) . Patient stable atrial fibrillation allow study provide cardiac exclusion criterion satisfy . Myocardial infarction unstable angina pectoris ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association class IIIIV ) Other clinically significant heart disease vascular disease ( e.g . uncontrolled hypertension ) 6 . Patient take medication relative risk prolong QT interval induce torsade de pointes , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug 7 . Patient impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption panobinostat , : Active ulcerative disease uncontrolled nausea vomit diarrhea CTCAE grade ≥ 2 ( despite antidiarrheal medication ) malabsorption syndrome obstruction stomach and/or small bowel resection 8 . Known HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C ( screen test require ) 9 . Female patient pregnant breast feed 10 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( limit ) uncontrolled diabetes active uncontrolled infection chronic obstructive chronic restrictive pulmonary disease include dyspnea rest cause uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction recent , acute active bleeding 11 . Presence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule . This condition must discuss patient prior sign consent registration trial . 12 . Prior diagnosis cancer : 3 year prior current diagnosis subsequent evidence disease recurrence estimate clinical expectation recurrence great 10 % within next 2 year within 3 year current diagnosis exception successfully treat basal cell squamous cell skin carcinoma , carcinoma situ cervix localise cancer treat curatively local therapy .</criteria>
