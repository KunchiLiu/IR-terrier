	<brief_summary>Malaria transmission fall part Africa bed net anti-malarials become widely available . However , transmission still persist appear additional control measure require . The lead malaria vaccine candidate development RTS , S efficacy clinical malaria measure 30-50 % field . This partial protection might enhance combination component . The vaccination approach produce repeatable efficacy human use viral vector induce T cell response . Previous attempt vaccine approach effective challenge study Oxford , ineffective field , probably reduce immunogenicity previous vector platform . Recently , study Oxford , Kenya Gambia show high level immunogenicity use chimpanzee adenovirus ( ChAd63 ) follow attenuate vaccinia virus ( modify vaccinia Ankara ) deliver pre-erythrocytic antigen , multiple epitope string thrombospondin- related adhesion protein ( ME-TRAP ) . The increase immunogenicity lead sterile protection 3 14 volunteer partial protection 5 14 volunteer challenge study . The investigator propose Phase 2b study 120 healthy adult men Senegal . The investigator assess efficacy evaluate immunogenicity safety profile vaccine regimen . The investigator also intend assess correlate efficacy natural immunity .</brief_summary>

Haemoglobin le 10.0 g/dl Clinically significant abnormality laboratory screen test ( full blood count , ALT , creatinine level ) . Blood transfusion within month precede enrolment . History vaccination previous experimental malaria vaccine vaccine likely impact finding study ( e.g . MVA adenovirus vectored vaccine ) Administration vaccine immunoglobulin within 2 week vaccination . HIV Hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity . Current participation another clinical trial recent participation within 12 week study . Any finding opinion investigator would increase risk adverse outcome participation trial .
