	<brief_summary>Background : - Plasma cell myeloma type cancer affect plasma cell bone marrow . It difficult treat chemotherapy . One possible treatment combine chemotherapy stem cell transplant . To make treatment effective , researcher want give another drug along transplant . This drug , carfilzomib , often use help treat plasma cell myeloma . However , usually give along transplant . Researchers want see safe effective combine stem cell transplant carfilzomib , improve result transplant . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness carfilzomib give stem cell transplant plasma cell myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age stem cell transplant treat plasma cell myeloma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study bone marrow biopsy also perform . - Participants stem cell collect transplant . The transplant perform accord standard care . - All participant receive carfilzomib first 2 day transplant . The study doctor determine number additional dos may . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Despite significant progress therapy plasma cell myeloma ( PCM ) last decade , disease remain mostly incurable . - High-dose chemotherapy follow autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) continue critical component early treatment PCM , clear disease eradicate present high-dose therapy strategy , intensify preparative regimen , day , result either improvement disease control increase toxicity . - Carfilzomib ( CFZ ) new proteasome inhibitor increase activity safer toxicity profile bortezomib PCM . The favorable toxicity profile make likely candidate increase anti-PCM drug exposure early post-AHCT period . Objectives : Primary Objectives -Evaluate feasibility toxicity increase number dos CFZ administer early period post-AHCT PCM Secondary Objective - Evaluate immune reconstitution post-AHCT follow CFZ therapy - Evaluate effect addition CFZ early post-AHCT period response rate day 100 post-AHCT Eligibility : - Newly diagnose subject PCM follow induction therapy - Subjects documentation persistent/refractory disease receive 2 salvage regimen follow relapse undergone AHCT - Adequate organ function major co-morbidity - Age great 18 year less equal 75 year Design : - Phase I/II study backbone high-dose melphalan day -2 pre-AHCT - Addition increase number dos CFZ early post-AHCT period introduce step-wise fashion 3 successive cohort 3 15 subject : Cohort 1 : add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 day +1 , +2 Cohort 2 : add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 day : +1 , +2 , +8 , +9 Cohort 3 : add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 day : +1 , +2 , +8 , +9 add early post-AHCT consolidation follow engraftment : CFZ 20 mg/m^2 give day 42-43 CFZ 56 mg/m^2 give day 49-50 , 56-57 , day 70-71 , 77-78 84-85 -Dose-limiting toxicity , incidence engraftment failure treatment-related mortality object early stop rule safety purpose</detailed_description>
