	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well selumetinib Akt inhibitor MK2206 work compare modified fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFOX ) therapy treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treat chemotherapy . Selumetinib Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether selumetinib Akt inhibitor MK2206 effective oxaliplatin fluorouracil treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib Akt Inhibitor MK2206 mFOLFOX Therapy Comprising Oxaliplatin Fluorouracil Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ( selumetinib ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) compare treated mFOLFOX . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess frequency severity toxicity associate combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 compare mFOLFOX patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 compare treat mFOLFOX . II . To assess objective tumor response subset patient measurable disease ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial response ) patient metastatic pancreatic cancer treat combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 compare treat mFOLFOX . III . To bank tissue blood future translational medicine study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 15 fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1-2 15-16 ( mFOLFOX ) . ARM II : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , selumetinib PO daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
