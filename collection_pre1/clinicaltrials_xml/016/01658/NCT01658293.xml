	<brief_summary>Sensory and/or motor deficit upper limb follow stroke often negative impact daily live . Thermal stimulation hot cold pack alternatively incorporated conventional rehabilitation report proved effective upper limb functional recovery stroke . However , whether hot- cold-water stimulation alternatively base thermal stimulation also effect still remain unknown . The aim present study investigate facilitate effect hot cold water stimulation alternatively upper limb stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke patient department rehabilitation Tzu Chi general hospital recruit randomized two group , one experimental group control group . In addition receive routine standard rehabilitation group , experimental group receive additional hot- cold-water stimulation alternatively five time one session , consecutive four session set , one set 30 minute day five set week six week . The control group give ergometer exercise similar duration experimental group . Both group evaluate baseline TS every two week till six week TS , 3 , 6 12 month follow-up . A variety evaluation use present study include Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments sensory function ; Brunnstrom 's stage , Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale Motricity Index use upper limb motor control strength ; Box block test hand dexterity . The modified Motor Assessment Scale Barthel Index utilize evaluate general motor function daily activity performance , respectively . The modified Ashworth scale use change muscle tone upper limb .</detailed_description>
