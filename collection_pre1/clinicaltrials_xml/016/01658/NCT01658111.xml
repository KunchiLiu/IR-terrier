	<brief_summary>Numerous study show ascertain effectiveness rehabilitative intervention condition lead long-term disability , stroke , complex task outcome depend many interacting factor . Several study underline importance brain plasticity therapeutic potential neurological disorder . Accredited theory cortical reorganization brain lesion endorse use early , intensive , repetitive , context-related exercise optimal strategy promote motor relearn minimize motor deficit . The use robotic system upper limb motor rehabilitation program already demonstrate provide safe intensive treatment subject motor impairment due neurological injury : several study show advantage robotic therapy chronic post-stroke patient , even consistent influence functional ability find evidence well result provide intensive treatment , robotic conventional rehabilitative technique , find . Recent development recent trial robot-assisted rehabilitation show great potential robotic device deliver repetitive training , thus facilitate high intensity large dose train sub-acute chronic phase stroke rehabilitation . The propose project , randomize control observer-blind multicenter trial aim evaluate effectiveness robot-assisted therapy additional treatment standard physical therapy early phase stroke onset evaluate conjunction EEG EMG recording effect rehabilitative treatment quantitative , measurable way , provide reliable objective method measure functional recovery stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main original contribution project provide experimental framework , base proximal robotic treatment approach , test whether start distal robot-assisted sensorimotor therapy effective improve motor function sub-acute stroke patient . The use robotic platform administer rehabilitation therapy crucial two main reason : 1. physical therapy base robotic platform assure patient test group treat repeatable way , eliminate intrinsic subject-dependent variability affect traditional therapy ; 2. robotic platform , conjunction EEG EMG recording , use assess effect rehabilitative treatment quantitative , measurable way , provide reliable objective method measure functional recovery stroke .</detailed_description>
