	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death globally . The majority CVD explain conventional risk factor include cigarette smoking , abnormal lipid , high blood pressure , obesity , diabetes , health behaviour include dietary intake , physical activity , psychosocial stressor . Genetic factor contribute development risk factor , directly CVD novel pathway . Since advent high throughput chip-based genotyping , 30 genetic variant find associate myocardial infarction . The robust genetic variant consistently associate myocardial infarction form arterial disease 9p21 variant . This genetic variant locate Chromosome 9 common population , 50 % people carry one copy risk allele , additional 25 % population carry two copy risk allele . Compared copy risk allele , risk myocardial infarction one copy risk allele 15-20 % high , increase risk among carrier 2 risk allele 20-40 % . To date exact mechanism 9p21 variant increase risk myocardial infarction unknown , although data suggests gene pathway associate cell proliferation inflammation involve . Recently make observation among carrier 9p21 variant , risk MI may `` turn '' individual consume diet high fruit vegetable . However `` mechanism '' underlie interaction unknown . We seek discover `` Prudent '' ( i.e . anti-inflammatory ) diet interact 9p21 risk allele ( ) alter risk myocardial infarction . We postulate `` Prudent '' diet ( i.e . diet high fruit , vegetable , whole grain , non-processed food ) comparison `` Western '' `` inflammatory diet '' ( eg , typical North American diet high saturate fat process food ) differentially alter gene expression ( measure RNA ) 9p21 locus , change epigenetic mark region , alter several inflammatory marker suspect mediate effect 9p21 CVD risk ( eg , hs-CRP , IF-alpha21 , IFN-Î³ , interleukin 1-alpha , interleukin 1-beta , interleukin 6 ) among people one two copy risk allele compare people without risk allele . The propose study offer unique approach study dietary relationship endpoint believe influenced 9p21 gene variant . Rather test nutritional supplement , result generalizable set dietary counseling practice , aim alter dietary pattern , specific nutrient . This trial help u unravel basis gene-diet interaction gain great understanding inflammation link development atherosclerosis , CVD , possibly cancer .</detailed_description>
