	<brief_title>Collecting Solid Tumor Tissue Identify New Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Recent advance insights molecular pathogenesis cancer lead development novel molecular biologic target therapy treatment advance cancer patient . A critical challenge extend study involve identification validation new therapeutic target future cancer therapy . - The Surgery Branch , NCI interest identify novel molecular biologic target facilitate development future cancer therapy . In addition , primary responsibility provide surgical consultative service NIH . As , uniquely position acquire perform important study solid tumor tissue help identify therapeutic target may significant clinical ramification . OBJECTIVES : - Primary Objective : To collect biologic sample patient undergo diagnostic therapeutic intervention premalignant , primary metastatic solid tumor purpose identify novel molecular biologic therapeutic target - Secondary Objectives : To collect detailed history , demographic , treatment data , perioperative finding order categorize track specific procedure outcomes . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients great equal 16 year age radiographic evidence , biochemical evidence , histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasm require diagnostic therapeutic intervention part diagnosis /or standard care treatment and/or follow neoplasm - Patients must laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior plan intervention DESIGN : - A tissue acquisition trial tissue obtain time intervention - Tissue blood process time collection , store transfer Dr. Kammula laboratory processing . - No investigational therapy give . - It anticipated 1000 patient enrol period 10 year</detailed_description>
