	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose methoxyamine give together fludarabine phosphate treat patient relapsed refractory hematologic malignancy . Drugs use chemotherapy , methoxyamine fludarabine phosphate , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving methoxyamine together fludarabine phosphate may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methoxyamine Fludarabine Phosphate Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) methoxyamine give conjunction fludarabine ( fludarabine phosphate ) subject relapse refractory hematologic malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose limit toxicity combination methoxyamine fludarabine . II . To determine pharmacokinetics methoxyamine give combination fludarabine . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic endpoint include apurinic/apyrimidinic ( AP ) sit deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) strand break blood mononuclear cell explore vivo mechanism action methoxyamine identify biologically optimal dose combine fludarabine . VI . To determine disease specific toxicity biologic activity cohort chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study methoxyamine . Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-5 methoxyamine IV 1 hour day 1 ( day 2 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
