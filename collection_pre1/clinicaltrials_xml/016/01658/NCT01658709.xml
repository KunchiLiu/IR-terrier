	<brief_summary>The objective study determine clinical measure use effectively predict ankle injury high school collegiate athlete across variety sport . Hypothesis : For ankle injury category ( lateral ankle sprain , medial ankle sprain , syndesmosis ankle sprain , Achilles rupture , fracture ) participant suffer injury significantly low SEBT normalize composite score FMS composite score compare participant suffer injury Hypothesis # 1b : Similar previous study examine high school basketball players22 , use receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve , able calculate likelihood ratio , odds ratio , sensitivity specificity determine ideal cut-off point SEBT normalize composite score FMS composite score able predict risk ankle injury category ( lateral ankle sprain , medial ankle sprain , syndesmosis ankle sprain , Achilles rupture , fracture ) . Athletes identify site perform measure star excursion balance test ( SEBT ) Functional Movement Screen FMS first day practice . During competition season , number practice competition person exposure , well number ankle injury , record . The rate ankle injuries/exposure calculate compare pre-season SEBT score create simple complex prediction model risk ankle injury</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study determine clinical measure dynamic postural control , star excursion balance test ( SEBT ) , simple functional testing battery , Functional Movement Screen ( FMS ) , use effectively predict ankle injury high school collegiate athlete across variety sport . Males female age 14 24 enrol one three designate high school Toledo , OH University Toledo recruit study . Eligible participant sign medically clear participate football , basketball , baseball , softball , soccer , volleyball , and/or cross country 2012/2013 academic year . Participants healthy must clear physician full participation time enrollment study . All enrol student athlete make aware study request prior pre-season physicals coach staff ATC prior begin first day practice . Consent assent obtain use appropriate university approve form . In prospective study design , pre-season dynamic postural control data previous injury history collect high school collegiate athlete . These athletic facility service certified Athletic Trainers ( ATC ) physician associate University Toledo University Toledo Medical Center . Prior begin 2012/2013 competition season , athlete identify site , part pre-season physical exam requirement , perform measure SEBT FMS first day practice . The performance SEBT FMS explain detail attach protocol . During competition season , number practice competition person exposure , well number ankle injury , record ATC school . Injury incidence explain detail attach protocol . At end competition season , rate ankle injuries/exposure calculate compare pre-season SEBT score create simple complex prediction model risk ankle injury .</detailed_description>
