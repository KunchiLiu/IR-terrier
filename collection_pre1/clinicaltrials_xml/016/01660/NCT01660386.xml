	<brief_summary>The objective study demonstrate different effect two DPP-4 inhibitor ( Sitagliptin , Saxagliptin ) insulin secretagogue : glimepiride first second phase insulin secretion use Biphase-Hyperglycemic Clamp explore different effect study drug GLP-1 response , glucagon concentration indicate alpha cell function healthy subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Different Effect DPP-4 Inhibitors Sulfonylurea Using `` Biphase-Hyperglycemic Clamp ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After enrollment two week screen period eligible subject counsel follow dietary program approximately 2 wk record personal history , full clinical examination screen blood sample . Subjects randomize use computer-generated allocation schedule one 12 sequence subject assign take 4 time bi-phase hyperglycaemic clamp experiment randomize sequence separate washout period 7-14d . At experimental day , subject take give dose Sitagliptin , Saxagliptin , Glimepiride nothing blank control two hour clamp experiment start . The hyperglycaemic clamp perform overnight fast . Subjects place recumbent position cannula insert dorsal hand vein . The hand place heating box ( 42C ) throughout experiment allow frequent sample arterialized blood . A second cannula insert contralateral cubital vein glucose infusion . At time zero ( 0 min ) , 50 % glucose bolus inject 1 min increase PG 12mM . The glucose bolus calculate : ( 12mM-FPG ) ×35 mg glucose × body weight ( kg ) . PG measure bedside every 5 min maintain 12mM adjustable continuous 20 % glucose infusion . After 90min , PG lower 6mM islet cell rest , subject instruct consume 75g glucose solution orally 5min , PG measure bedside every 5 min maintain 6mM 40min restart 90min-hyperglycaemic clamp experiment . The oral period hyperglycaemic clamp process 's do fasting period . Blood sample collect -2h , 0min , 10min , 90min hyperglycaemic clamp experimental process measurement insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , active GLP-1 , total GLP-1 DPP-4 activity . Thus could evaluate beta cell function represent first phase second phase insulin secretion ( C-peptide secretion ) alpha cell function represent change glucagon concentration fast period oral period hyperglycaemic clamp experiment change active GLP-1 , total GLP-1 DPP-4 activity well .</detailed_description>
