	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gemcitabine hydrochloride dasatinib give together erlotinib hydrochloride treat patient pancreatic cancer spread place body remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Dasatinib erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride dasatinib together erlotinib hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( also phase II recommend dose ) combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) dasatinib patient advance pancreatic adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile combination gemcitabine , erlotinib dasatinib . II . To evaluate response rate response duration advance pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat dasatinib , erlotinib gemcitabine . III . To determine progression-free survival overall survival group patient . IV . To determine utility advanced magnetic resonance image technique assess vivo effect therapy ( change tumor vascularity , cellularity ) . V. To assess use serum marker predictor response outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gemcitabine hydrochloride dasatinib . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 4 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
