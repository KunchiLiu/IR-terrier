	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Pre- Post-surgery Chemotherapy With mFOLFIRINOX Localized , Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma highly lethal disease . It estimate 2010 approximately 43,140 new case United States 36,800 death rank fourth among cancer relate death . At diagnosis , roughly 17,000 initial 43,000 patient disease appear localize pancreatic bed , unfortunately , minority patient ( 15-20 % ) immediately operable ( image study disease appear localized pancreas technically resectable clear margin , surgery unexpected finding preclude R0 resection ) . It note patient deem immediately operable clinical ground , 20 57 % find inoperable disease exploration depend series extent nature preoperative staging . The majority patient locally advance , borderline resectable unresectable disease owe involvement critical structure , particularly sentinel blood vessel SMA , celiac axis , hepatic artery , SMV , portal vein . Furthermore , despite recent advance systemic therapy , even fortunate able undergo immediate surgery remain largely incurable , five year survival slightly less 20 % . The current standard care adjuvant therapy resectable pancreatic cancer base CONKO-001 study randomize patient 6 cycle postoperative adjuvant therapy gemcitabine versus observation alone . Results favor adjuvant gemcitabine disease free survival ( 13.4 vs 6.9 month , p &lt; 0.001 ) overall survival ( 24.2 month vs 20.5 month p=0.02 ) strongly support use adjuvant gemcitabine set R0 R1 resection . An RTOG study - 97-04 - conclude gemcitabine probably superior 5FU use pre postoperatively combination 5FU/RT , HR 0.82 . The role radiation therapy setting remain controversial , study GITSG trial ( pro ) ESPAC 1 ( con ) criticize either questionable design , outdated chemotherapy unconventional radiation therapy . Current study progress examine postoperative therapy include RTOG 0848 ( phase III look adjuvant gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus erlotinib plus/minus chemo/RT use fluorouracil ) , ACOSOG Z5041 evaluate gemcitabine plus erlotinib pre postoperative setting ESPAC 4 evaluate gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus capecitabine . Many study explore use neoadjuvant therapy initially resectable , borderline resectable unresectable disease . The majority single arm , single institution phase I/II study , result mix . Potential benefit neoadjuvant approach include : downstaging disease increase percentage margin negative lymph node negative resection ; delay systemic therapy aim eradicate micrometastatic disease ; detection biologically aggressive tumor , evidence early progression/metastases phase therapy , thereby avoid inappropriate surgery ; great likelihood complete intend therapy oppose postoperative treatment , fully 22 - 35 % patient complete intend program . A comprehensive meta-analysis systematic review neoadjuvant therapy resectable unresectable pancreatic cancer recently publish . The conclusion reach resectable patient resection frequency survival follow neoadjuvant therapy similar patient undergoing primary resection follow adjuvant therapy . In patient initially unresectable disease , fully one third resectable tumor follow neoadjuvant therapy survival comparable initially resectable patient . In aggregate , observation indicate neoadjuvant approach feasible effective , sequence compromise resectability survival , even patient best prognosis . With respect specific study resectable disease , investigator MD Anderson Cancer Center publish recent result . In first study , 86 patient resectable disease head pancreas receive radiation therapy ( 30 Gy 10 fraction 2 week ) plus 7 weekly infusion gemcitabine 400 mg/m2/week . 85 % patient take surgery 74 % able undergo intend pancreaticoduodenectomy . Median survival patient whose disease resect 34 month , 7 month whose disease could resect . In second study patient resectable adenocarcinoma pancreatic head , 90 patient enrolled goal administer chemotherapy alone eight week , use gemcitabine cisplatin , follow combined low dose gemcitabine radiation therapy ( 30 Gy 10 fraction ) . Ultimately , 79 ( 88 % ) patient complete full course preoperative therapy 62 ( 78 % ) patient take surgery . 52 ( 66 % ) disease resect median survival 31 month surgery , versus 10.5 month . They conclude initial combination chemotherapy gemcitabine cisplatin follow chemotherapy/RT improve result achieve chemotherapy/RT alone . This result perhaps surprising gemcitabine , alone doublet combination , simply active enough materially impact outcome disease . Interestingly , longer preoperative interval result local tumor progression . These finding similar major center report study neoadjuvant gemcitabine base chemoradiation potentially resectable disease , suggest valid strategy study set . Recently , investigator Europe report result novel combination docetaxel 30 mg/m2 weekly RT 45 Gy 34 patient resectable disease . 32 % progression , 59 % stable disease 9 % partial remission . 50 % original cohort pancreaticoduodenectomy 100 % R0 resection median survival 32 month . The number small overall resection rate disappointingly low , R0 resection rate median survival resect equivalent patient receive gemcitabine base regimen . In locally advanced , unresectable disease , result recently report Austria neoadjuvant gemcitabine/oxaliplatin without RT ( 39 % patient undergoing resection disease 69 % R0 22 month median survival ) , Italy neoadjuvant PEFG/PEXG ( cisplatin , epirubicin , 5-fluorouracil ( F ) /capecitabine ( X ) , gemcitabine ) PDXG ( docetaxel substitute epirubicin ) follow RT plus X , F G ( 14 % resected median survival 16.2 month ) Japan neoadjuvant gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/wk RT 50 Gy T3 disease follow postoperative 5FU liver perfusion ( 82 % patient disease resect , 43 % 5 year survival ) . In study , mixture borderline resectable unresectable disease result interpretation outcomes problematic . However , clear neoadjuvant approach feasible active . It clear examination NCI CTEP database neoadjuvant approach widely embrace future study . More 40 active protocol list , include follow select : UVA study hypofractionated RT plus chronomodulated capecitabine resectable borderline resectable disease ; UT Southwestern phase I study SBRT SBRT plus gemcitabine ; Emory phase I study FOLFIRINOX SBRT ; Fred Hutchinson study GTX oxaliplatin IMRT adjuvant gemcitabine ; UF phase II study risk adapt gemcitabine plus abraxane ; European randomize phase II study gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin pre gemcitabine postoperatively versus gemcitabine postoperatively ; Memorial Sloan Kettering phase II study gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin preoperatively plus gemcitabine postoperatively ; ACOSOG study gemcitabine plus erlotinib pre postoperatively . Looking future number recent innovation chemotherapy . In ongoing effort discover non-gemcitabine base chemotherapy progress gemcitabine , also new regimen efficacy currently use patient pancreatic cancer , combination 5FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin irinotecan test . This combination initially study colorectal cancer , regimen know FOLFOXIRI . It establish combination tolerable effective setting . Subsequently , regimen modify slightly current FOLFIRINOX format ( oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 , irinotecan 180 mg/m2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m2 , 5FU 400 mg/m2 day 1 , 5FU 2400 mg/m2 46 hour continuous infusion ) test phase II study pancreatic cancer . 47 chemotherapy-naïve patient metastatic disease enrol 46 treat . Confirmed response rate 26 % 4 % complete response . Median time progression 8.2 month median overall survival 10.2 month . Grade 3/4 toxicity include neutropenia ( 52 % ) , nausea ( 20 % ) , vomit ( 17 % ) , diarrhea ( 15 % ) , neuropathy ( 15 % ) . No toxic death occur . FOLFIRINOX test failure previous gemcitabine therapy metastatic disease deem promising . 13 patient treat , 9 evaluable response - 6 stable disease mean time progression 6.6 month , 3 progress . As consequence previously mention phase II study chemo-naïve patient , randomized phase II/phase III study compare gemcitabine ( G ) FOLFIRINOX ( F ) first line treatment metastatic pancreatic cancer conduct . This study terminate prematurely study IDMC determine additional patient accrual would add statistical power study . 342 patient accrue roughly one third primary disease involve head pancreas . Overall objective response rate 32 % F versus 9.4 % G. PFS 6.4 month versus 3.4 month overall survival 11.1 month versus 6.8 month , favor F. The overall survival rate 11.1 month best result achieve thus far randomized phase III study chemotherapy metastatic pancreatic cancer . Notable toxicity least grade III/IV , bad F , neutropenia ( 45.7 vs 18.7 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 5.4 vs 0.6 % ) , fatigue ( 23.7 vs 14.2 % ) , vomit ( 14.5 vs 4.7 % ) diarrhea ( 12.7 vs 1.2 % ) . These result indicate notably active regimen encourage response rate . However , potential toxicity significant , regimen offer patient ECOG 0-1 performance status excellent supportive care . In regard , attempt ameliorate toxicity , modification publish regimen already propose French group others . In forthcoming study FOLFIRINOX adjuvant setting , French omit bolus 5FU contributes significantly myelosuppression think minimal impact therapeutic efficacy . In addition , physician incorporate routine use neulasta treatment cycle . This study similarly incorporate modification regimen name mFOLFIRINOX . Thus , context perioperative therapy , identify regimen - FOLFIRINOX - best result date treatment metastatic disease inference , promise improve outcome patient resectable disease . If successful , potential improve DFS overall survival ( well 15-20 % 5 year ) patient , may establish new paradigm future study .</detailed_description>
