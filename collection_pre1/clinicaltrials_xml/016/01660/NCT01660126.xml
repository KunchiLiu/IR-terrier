	<brief_summary>Subclinical hypothyroidism ( SCH ) common condition among old men woman . Although definition SCH comprise biochemically mild thyroid hormone deficiency without overt symptom , possible contributor multiple problem old age . Thyroid hormone effect numerous physiological system , include vascular tree , heart , skeletal muscle brain . Therefore , thyroxine substitution overcome thyroid hormone deficiency potential give multisystem benefit old people SCH . Small study report reduced atherosclerosis improve heart function thyroxine replacement , large clinical trial perform . Therefore available evidence limit , lead major variation guideline clinical practice , uncertainty regard indication screen treatment . The investigator propose multicentre randomise placebo control trial ass impact thyroxine replacement minimum 540 old adult ( maximum 750 ) persisting SCH ( exclude temporary phenomenon unlikely benefit ) . The investigator include old men woman wide age range vary health status . Outcomes include health relate quality life , muscle strength , executive cognitive function cardiovascular event , minimum 1 year follow . Blood urine sample store biobank , allow future research cause ill health old people SCH . The investigator support patient advocacy group consortium wide range expertise experience require conduct large scale multicentre clinical trial . The proposal explore multisystem quality life benefit old people tailor approach management SCH . This clinical trial definitively clarify whether thyroxine treatment SCH provide benefit relevant patient . This trial provide strong evidence potential improve clinical practice , reduce health care cost promote healthy age old adult .</brief_summary>
