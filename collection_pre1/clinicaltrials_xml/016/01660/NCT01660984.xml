	<brief_summary>Background : - Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) rare cancer thyroid gland . In child young adult , often part condition call Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2 ( MEN2 ) . MEN2 usually cause genetic mutation , cause number problem addition MTC . These problem include adrenal gland tumor , hormone change , problem bone organ . Not much know MTC develops time , especially people MEN2 . Researchers want study MTC child young adult see affect growth development . Objectives : - To study medullary thyroid cancer affect child young adult time . Eligibility : - Children young adult young 25 year age medullary thyroid cancer . Design : - Participants screen brief physical exam medical history . Blood tissue sample collect see whether participant MEN2 genetic mutation . - Treatment provide part study . However , participant receive standard care MTC . They may eligible clinical trial National Institutes Health . - Participants regular study visit every 6 12 month evaluate MTC treatment . Blood test , image study , test may perform needed monitor disease . - Participants parents/guardians also complete questionnaire health emotion study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC ) calcitonin produce tumor arise parafollicular C cell thyroid . In child young adult , MTC usually see association Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) 2A 2B , rare cancer syndrome result germline mutation Rearranged Transfection ( RET ) proto-oncogene . MTC develop virtually patient MEN 2 , lead cause death patient . Patients MEN 2 may characteristic manifestation pheochromocytoma hyperparathyroidism MEN 2A pheochromocytoma , ganglioneuromatosis , skeletal deformity MEN 2B . - Complete surgical resection current curative treatment MTC , tumor unresponsive standard chemotherapy conventional dos radiation therapy . However , half patient present advanced metastatic disease cure surgically . Novel agent currently investigation treatment MTC , vandetanib , oral RET receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor recently approve FDA adult advance metastatic MTC . Vandetanib also activity child hereditary MTC . - However , complete response RTKs observe , patient develop resistance treatment RET RTK inhibitor primary refractory disease . The natural history MTC , particularly patient MEN 2 , molecular pathway involve tumorigenesis , development resistance target therapy well understood . Objectives : -The overall objective longitudinal study develop well understand biology natural history MEN2 without MTC , particularly child young adult MEN 2A 2B , well study non-tumor manifestation MEN 2 . This hopefully allow develop effective treatment intervention tumor non-tumor related manifestation , sensitive endpoint clinical trial . Eligibility : - Patients less equal 30 year age , must histologically cytologically confirm MTC , confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI MEN2 ( regardless MTC status ) . - Participants may undergo standard care receive treatment clinical trial participate study . Design : This study allow longitudinal evaluation MTC MEN2 non-tumor related manifestation MEN 2A 2B child young adult . Evaluations consist follow ( summarize ) : 1 . Clinical radiological evaluation 2 . Detailed pathologic molecular analysis tumor specimen perform , include immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) , genome sequencing . CGH genome sequence performd co-enrollment protocol 10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis Pediatric Solid Tumors Establishment Repository Related Biological Studies .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm MTC , confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI Disease status : Patients must evidence active MTC document either elevate plasma biomarkers ( CEA and/or calcitonin ) , presence evaluable measurable disease . Age : less equal 25 year age Performance Status : Ability travel NIH undergo evaluation perform protocol . Informed Consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient &lt; 18 year old ) must sign IRBapproved document inform consent demonstrate understanding investigational nature risk study protocolrelated study perform . When appropriate , pediatric subject include discussion . Prior current therapy : For purpose study subject previously receive medical surgical treatment , patient , previously receive medical surgical treatment , subject currently receive medical treatment radiation MEN 2 related manifestation eligible . Prior current treatment MEN 2 related manifestation record trial entry throughout study . Patients must primary care provider ( example primary oncologist endocrinologist ) provide coordinate medical care patient EXCLUSION CRITERIA : In opinion investigator patient able return followup visit obtain required followup study . Individuals pregnant breast feed become pregnant enrolled trial exclude participation , undergo radiographic evaluation study research purpose , might negatively impact pregnancy .</criteria>
