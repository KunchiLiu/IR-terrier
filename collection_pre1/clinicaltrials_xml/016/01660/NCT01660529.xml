	<detailed_description>hTERT widely find breast cancer cell role tumor growth development , make attractive immunotherapy . Also , recent data suggest breast cancer potentially responsive immunological therapy . In one trial , patient advance cancer receive series hTERT vaccination 4 7 patient advance breast prostate carcinoma develop hTERT-specific T lymphocyte . Partial tumor regression observe 1 patient . In second trial , 19 HLA A2+ patient metastatic breast cancer vaccinate hTERT 1540 peptide adjuvant GM-CSF . 68 % patient exhibit immunological response development CD8+ hTERT-specific T-cells . Overall survival vaccine responder signifiantly well overall survival non-responders . In order expand number possible immune response potentially bypass immune tolerance , multiple peptide add vaccine . In addition , monoclonal antibody basiliximab include decrease regulatory T cell prevent immune system work tumor , GM-CSF Prevnar use boost immune system . Subjects receive maximum 28 vaccination 24 month period .</detailed_description>
