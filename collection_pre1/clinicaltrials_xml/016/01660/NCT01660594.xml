	<brief_summary>Patients stable chest pain present general practitioner UK routinely refer chest pain clinic hospital . They assess clinical history include risk factor , cardiovascular exam , rest ECG , chest x-ray , exercise ECG . CT calcium scoring ( CTCS ) technique sensitive identify quantify calcify atherosclerotic plaque . Recent guidance National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE , citation 1 ) proposes use CTCS patient stable chest pain low likelihood coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . They recommend patient low likelihood ( 10-30 % ) CTCS score 0 , consider non-cardiac chest pain . However , controversy regard relationship absent calcification significant CAD prognostic value . At institution , perform CTCS patient cohort since 2003 . We plan retrospectively review usefulness CTCS patient different likelihood significant CAD , particularly patient absent calcium compare traditional assessment . We also plan follow-up patient myocardial infarction death cause .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study seek determine usefulness CT calcium scoring ( CTCS ) patient present non-acute chest pain rapid access chest pain clinic ( RACPC ) compare traditional assessment predict significant CAD outcome respect non-fatal MI death . The clinical , diagnostic , follow-up data patient last 7 year since CTCS perform hospital would retrospectively analyse purpose . Background Patients chest pain ( exclude sudden onset ) routinely refer GPs RACPC centre hospital . They assess clinical history include risk factor , cardiovascular exam , rest ECG , chest x-ray , exercise ECG . At institution , also perform CTCS men 40 woman 50 year age since 2003 . Recent NICE guidance1 recommend patient low pre-test probability ( 10-30 % ) significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) CT calcium score scan score 0 , consider non-cardiac chest pain . However , controversy regard relationship absent calcification significant CAD prognostic value . This study would enable u compare determine value CTCS patient non-acute chest pain predict significant CAD safety absent coronary artery calcification . Rationale Study 1 . To determine CT coronary calcium score add value exist clinical assessment exercise ECG . This well establish patient present non-acute chest pain rapid access chest pain clinic . 2 . The study would help determine absence calcification CT consider low likelihood significant coronary artery disease good cardiovascular outcome period follow-up . Both issue currently controversial literature group patient . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective To determine prognostic value CT coronary calcium score patient non-acute chest pain non-fatal MI death , compare traditional assessment include exercise ECG . Secondary Objectives To determine CT coronary calcium score compare traditional assessment include exercise ECG predicting significant coronary artery disease patient present non-acute chest pain . METHODOLOGY Design This retrospective cross-sectional study involve analysis patient ' clinical , diagnostic , management data hospital record follow-up questionnaire outcome . The study require new diagnostic , therapeutic , interventional procedure . Data patient present chest pain clinic since October 2003 would collect hospital record : 1 . Age , sex , type chest pain , risk factor . These would use calculate pre-test probability significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) use Duke 's score . 2 . Results exercise ECG perform . 3 . Results CT calcium score . 4 . Results non-invasive investigation stress image CT coronary angiography perform . 5 . Results invasive coronary angiography perform . Patients &gt; 70 % diameter stenosis underwent percutaneous stent insertion ( PCI ) bypass surgery would consider significant CAD . For patient undergo PCI surgery result evaluation , try find subsequently suffer heart attack die . This would perform hospital record available , questionnaire send patient and/or GPs part standard clinical care .</detailed_description>
