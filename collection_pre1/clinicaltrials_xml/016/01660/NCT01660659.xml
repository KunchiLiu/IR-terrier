	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) , specifically Severe Pneumonia , lead cause death child 5 year age . Of nearly 10 million child 5 die year , 1.9 million die ARI , almost occur develop country [ 1 , 2 ] . Over year , various study identify many risk factor associate ARI , include malnutrition , zinc deficiency , indoor air pollution ( IAP ) solid fuels tobacco . Proven efficacious intervention develop studied address risk factor related nutrition zinc deficiency still little known IAP proven effective intervention . Furthermore , little know quantifiable relationship IAP exposure disease , specifically ARI . IAP cook biomass one top ten global health risk [ 3 ] . 1.6 million people estimate die every year IAP exposure , half child 5 year age [ 4 ] . In develop country , IAP estimate account 3.7 % total burden disease , make fourth serious health risk factor malnutrition , STDs , inadequate water sanitation [ 5 ] . A recent meta-analysis find child 5 year old living household use biomass fuel 78 % great chance contract pneumonia child households cleaner-burning fuel [ 6 ] . In Africa , 94 % rural population 73 % urban population use solid fuel primary source energy [ 7 ] . Not IAP disproportionally affect poor , also affect woman child spend time near cook fire therefore expose . Because difficulty measuring exposure , observational study use proxy measure . These proxy include type fuel use , amount time spend near cook fire , whether child carry mother 's back cooking . But variation personal exposure country depend variety factor ( e.g . fuel , stove , housing , behavioral ) , proxy indicator insufficient method effectively capture variation exposure [ 8 ] . This affect understanding knowledge potential health gain might result reduce exposure vary amount . Determining exposure-disease relationship crucial understanding possible impact intervention may improve health [ 9 ] . Unfortunately , amount research do pollutant exposure IAP negligible compare huge disease burden associate exposure [ 10 ] . A lot research need conduct help live 3 billion affect harmful pollutant . Interventional Research Interventional research focus develop efficient biomass stove approach reduce IAP , yet study look alternative biomass fuel . Though improved stove show reduce pollutant emission control setting , remain difficult measure true effectiveness intervention , i.e . whether stove actually reduce pollutant local kitchen . The Water Boiling Test ( WBT ) Controlled Cooking Tests ( CCT ) , conduct control environment , base assumption perform simple cooking task produce estimate use evaluate technology develop population [ 11 ] . However , numerous behavioral outside variable alter efficiency stave , test illustrate true picture technology perform among population [ 12 ] . The Kitchen Performance Test ( KPT ) design measure effectiveness though difficulty implementation , often used measure stave performance . Furthermore , vary result field effectiveness reduce IAP improved stove [ 9 ] . Given wide variability stove setting , remain difficult know level IAP exposure reduction expect . Because uncertainty challenge reduce IAP improved stove , intervention reduce pollutant level need explore , use alternative biomass fuel lieu wood . A study 2003 rural Kenya look model potential reduction disease follow intervention include fuel , stave type cook location . This study show large reduction switch fuel stove [ 3 ] . There handful study throughout develop country currently look use crop waste alternative fuel . But crop waste varies greatly locality , separate testing need do different crop waste transformation cook fuel . In The Gambia West Central Africa , groundnuts major cash crop shell available abundance . Recently , two separate factory establish The Gambia process dry groundnut shell biomass briquette , use cook fuel . During Phase I study , investigator test ( currently retesting ) two available biomass briquette make groundnut shell . Both WBT CCT conduct evaluate performance fuel ( comparison wood charcoal ) use different stove , well IAP emission . These test conduct accordance protocol develop Shell Foundation Household Energy Health Program [ 13 , 14 ] . The investigator also concurrently measure PM2.5 concentration two way : continuous PM2.5 concentration use light-scattering , TSI 8520 DustTrak monitor integrate PM2.5 concentration use gravimetric Casella pump , cyclone , Teflon filter . CO concentration also measure alongside CCT use Drager CO 50/a-D Diffusion Tubes . The Investigators preliminary analysis show briquettes burn much clean wood use test stove . The investigator currently retesting briquette different stove assure investigator cleanest stove/fuel combination Phase II . For Phase II ( proposal ) , investigator test effectiveness biomass briquettes community . It possible investigator also use improve stove briquette , though decision make final analysis complete December/January . However , base preliminary analysis , investigator lean towards briquettes traditional 3-stone . For simplicity sake , briquette mention intervention throughout document . Though RCTs usually measure efficacy intervention , study slightly different efficiency efficacy already conduct Phase I . This study enable investigator evaluate true reduction IAP emission study population , well cost effectiveness use briquette compare wood charcoal . From preliminary research , investigator find briquette perform similarly wood , therefore anticipate difficulty adopt use briquette . Using pneumococcal carriage proxy measure health outcome Pneumonia account ~30 % deaths child age 5 develop country , result Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) . Pneumococci generally colonize nasopharynx within first month life , carriage rate child develop country 2-3 time higher found child develop country [ 15 , 16 ] . In one study The Gambia , find pneumococcal carriage great 80 % third month life [ 17 ] . In another study Bangladesh , find 50 % child colonize pneumococcus least age 8 week [ 18 ] . Though pneumococcal carriage present many healthy people , identifiable risk disease , predominantly affect young develop country . Nasopharyngeal colonization necessary phase infection S pneumoniae occur [ 19 ] . Therefore , prevent colonization ever happen important measure prevent S pneumoniae . As IAP exposure one major risk factor develop ARI , understand IAP exposure affect risk infection pneumococcal carrier help u good understand quantitative relationship IAP exposure disease ( severe pneumonia ) . There previous study look impact tobacco smoke carriage , date , yet research do look carriage IAP exposure . This study may instrumental help understand complex exposure-disease relationship . This component study Proof-of-Concept study , therefore design illustrate potential relationship IAP exposure ARI . If use pneumococcal carriage proxy show effective tool help quantify relationship , potential lay foundation research look IAP affect pneumococcal carriage .</detailed_description>
