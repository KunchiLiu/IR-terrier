	<brief_summary>The overall objective proposal develop non-invasive , inexpensive accurate device detects VOCs exhale breath lung cancer screen . Toward goal , team design fabricate biophotonic platform consist array silicon micro-ring resonator sensor coat polymer different organic functionality , sensor widely responsive variety VOCs detection lung cancer mean breath test . The team identify signature VOCs lung cancer biomarkers comparison VOC content alveolar gas directly sample nodule mass exhale breath use gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry . The specific aim proposal following : Aim 1 : To develop biophotonic platform detection VOCs Aim 2 : To achieve multiplex detection VOCs high sensitivity specificity use novel biophotonic device . Aim 3 : To evaluate device lung cancer screen tool test healthy lung cancer breath sample</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death throughout world account 1.2M new case worldwide annually , make lung cancer one serious public health problem industrialized country . Up date valid screening method lung cancer . Thus often diagnosed advance stage treatment less effective , consequantly lead high mortality rate . However , early diagnosis treatment , 5-year survival rate improve dramatically 1 % stage 4 , 20 % stage 3 70 % stage 1 disease . Therefore early diagnosis play pivotal role improve survival otherwise uniformly fatal disease . In recently study , find product metabolism , call volatile organic comounds ( VOCs ) , carry breath serve biomarkers . Cancer cell produce different type VOCs normal cell . More importantly , VOC marker find exhaled breath cancer stag 1 4 . Combining strength IME 's biophotonics , research group NUS basic science NUH clinician 's knowledge expertise lung cancer , proposal aim tackle challenge lung cancer screen develop non-invasive , inexpensive , accurate sensor platform detect VOCs exhale breath . The device consist array silicon micro-ring resonator sensor coat polymer different organic functionality , sensor widely responsive variety VOCs . In proposal , plan build prototype device test detection VOCs exhale breath healthy control lung cancer patient . The successful outcome proposal would immense impact lung cancer management enable early stage cancer screening .</detailed_description>
