	<brief_summary>The objective study ( part A ) evaluate efficacy safety BAY80-6946 patient indolent aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , progress standard therapy . 30 patient enrolled indolent aggressive disease group . The objective study part B evaluate efficacy safety BAY80-6946 patient relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma . 120 patient enrolled part B study . Further objectives evaluate pharmacokinetics biomarkers . Quality life objective part B study . In cohort 20 patient ( enrolled part A B ) ECG substudy perform assess potential cardiac toxicity QT/QTc interval prolongation BAY80-6946 . After 28-day screening period , eligible patient start treatment BAY80-6946 dose 0.8 mg/kg ( Part A ) dose 60 mg ( Part B ) . Treatment continue disease progress another criterion meet withdrawal study . An end-of-treatment visit perform within 7 day discontinuation study treatment . Thirty 35 day last study drug administration , safety followup visit perform collection adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication data . Patients contact quarterly determine overall survival status 3 year last patient first treatment . In Part B , patient enter Active Assessment Followup Period . The end study notification Health Authorities base completion collection survival data . The efficacy measure decrease tumor size . Tumor assessment do Screening , every 8 week Year 1 , every 12 week Year 2 , every 6 month Year 3 . Blood sample collect pharmacokinetic analysis . Archival tumor tissue blood sample collect biomarker analysis ( mandatory ) central pathology review ( part B ) , fresh biopsy tissue also collect available .</brief_summary>
