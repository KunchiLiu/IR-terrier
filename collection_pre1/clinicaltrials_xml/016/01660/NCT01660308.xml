	<brief_summary>Fibroblast froth factor ( FGFs ) humoral factor identify ability stimulate cell proliferation1 . They play different role regulation cell proliferation , differentiation function . Most FGF family member act paracrine factor . But FGF19 ( FGF19 ) subfamily member , include FGF19 , 21 , 23 , work endocrine factor regulate bile acid , carbohydrate phosphate metabolism2 . Of , FGF23 play important role phosphate bone metabolism3 . FGF23 gene encode 251 amino acid , include 24-amino acid signal peptide4 . The secreted FGF23 protein consist 227 amino acid . It work bind Klotho-FGF receptor 1c ( FGF1c ) complex5 . FGF suppress expression type 2a 2c sodium-phosphate cotransporters , mediate phosphate reabsorption proximal tubules.6 FGF23 decrease 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase expression enhance 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase expression6 . Therefore , FGF23 reduce serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D〔1,25 ( OH ) 2D〕 , stimulate intestinal calcium phosphate absorption . FGF23 decrease serum phosphate mechanism FGF23 over-expression might result hypophosphatemic rickets osteomalacia . Tumor induce osteomalacia ( TIO ) paraneoplastic syndrome usually cause benign phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor . Symptoms nonspecific , general weakness , fatigue , bone pain . Sometimes fracture may occur . The responsible tumor sometimes small difficult detect . Tumors secrete FGF23 . FGF23 reduce phosphate reabsorption proximal tubule decrease 1,25 ( OH ) 2D level , result hypophosphatemia osteomalacia . The investigator would like observe change FGF23 patient receive operation medical treatment hope benefit future treatment .</brief_summary>
