	<brief_summary>Project Grow Smart evaluate impact 12-month intervention micronutrient-fortified food early learning intervention young child 's cognitive ability . There infancy phase preschool phase . The infant phase conduct home visit - micronutrient sachet distribute mixed food . The preschool phase conduct Anganwadi Centers . Hypothesis # 1 infant receive micronutrient early learn intervention well score measure child development child receive neither . Children receive one two intervention intermediate score . Hypothesis # 2 preschooler Anganwadi Centers receive micronutrient-enriched food wll well score measure child development child Anganwadi Centers . The preschool phase conduct Anganwadi Centers ( AWC ) , like preschool . Preschoolers age 36-48 month recruit . AWC classify high low stimulation , base rating system ( Early Childhood Childcare Environmental Rating Scale , ECERS ) . AWC randomize 2 cell : 1 ) multiple micronutrient-fortified food 2 ) placebo-fortified food . Preschoolers receive food AWC ; mother receive information iron-rich food . For phase , evaluation conduct recruitment 6 12 month focus change child 's cognitive performance micronutrient ( iron ) status . The investigator hypothesize innovative multiple micronutrient ( MN ) fortification strategy infants preschooler combine early learning opportunity impact child 's micronutrient status , growth development Nalgonda district Andhra Pradesh , India .</brief_summary>
