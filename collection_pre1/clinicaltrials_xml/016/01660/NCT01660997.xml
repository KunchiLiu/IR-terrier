	<brief_summary>Background : - Smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM ) condition lead multiple myeloma , type blood cancer . In many high-risk case , SMM develop multiple myeloma le 2 year . The current standard care SMM follow-up without treatment multiple myeloma develops . However , drug study see slow prevent disease progress . One drug MLN9708 . It show result multiple myeloma . Researchers want combine MLN9708 dexamethasone see work high-risk SMM . Objectives : - To see MLN9708 dexamethasone safe effective treatment high-risk smolder multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age high-risk smolder multiple myeloma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study bone marrow biopsy may also perform . - Participants take MLN9708 dexamethasone regular schedule 28 day . They take drug four time regular interval cycle treatment . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants 12 cycle treatment . After four cycle , patient recommend stem cell collect stored . This allow potential application highdose melpahalan/autologous stem cell transplant event need future ( part study ) . - After 12 cycle , participant keep take MLN9708 long disease progress side effect severe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - SMM precursor condition MM define clinical parameter M-protein great equal 3.0 g/dL bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 % absence end organ disease . - Risk progression high risk SMM 5 year 72-75 % median time progression le 2 year . - The current standard care SMM close follow-up without treatment symptomatic MM develops . However , IMWG state Preventive clinical trial need consider patient high risk smolder myeloma . - MLN9708 new oral proteasome inhibitor potent anti-MM effect Objectives : Primary Endpoint : -The primary objective study assess response rate MLN9708/low-dose dexamethasone patient high-risk SMM . Secondary Endpoints : - To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) - To determine duration response ( DOR ) - To evaluate toxicity combination therapy ( MLN9708 low-dose dexamethasone ) . - To evaluate biological activity MLN9708 correlate clinical outcome ( gene expression profile proteasome activity ubiquination assay , effect downstream signal target use pre- post-MLN9708 exposure bone marrow sample ) Eligibility : - SMM accord International Myeloma Working Group definition i.e . : - Serum M-protein great equal 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cell great equal 10 % , - Absence anemia : Hemoglobin great than10 g/dl - Absence renal failure : calculated creatinine clearance ( accord MDRD ) great 80 ml/min ( alternatively base standard creatinine level criterion 2 mg/dl ) - Absence hypercalcemia : Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl less equal 2.5 mmol/L - Absence lytic bone lesion - Measurable disease within past 4 week define one following : - Serum monoclonal protein great equal 1.0 g/dl - Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour - Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt; 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio ( reference 0.26-1.65 ) - High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic Spanish PETHEMA criterion - Age great than18 year - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 - Ability give inform consent - Patients must normal organ marrow function define : - absolute neutrophil count great than1.0 K/uL - platelet great than75 K/uL ( Platelet transfusion help patient meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day study enrolment . ) - hemoglobin great 8 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) - total bilirubin less than1.5 X institutional upper limit normal - AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less 3.0 X institutional upper limit normal Design : -Single arm pilot trial combination therapy ( MLN9708 dexamethasone ) high risk smolder multiple myeloma - Patients receive 12 cycle ( 28 day ) induction combination therapy MLN9708 low-dose dexamethasone . After 12 cycle MLN9708/low-dose dexamethasone , patient receive MLN9708 maintenance progression unacceptable toxicity . - Patients routine blood work SPEP free light chain monthly - Pre- post-treatment bone marrow biopsy obtain confirmation diagnosis correlative study - Patients also undergo evaluation minimal residual disease complete remission/completion 12 cycle therapy , use multi-parametric flow cytometry FDG PET-CT - This single arm pilot study enroll 12 evaluable patient determine M-spike level patient immediately pre-treatment well complete 12 cycle treatment . The study aim find 9 patient ( 12 ) partial response ( PR ) better ; would provide strong evidence true probability overall response consistent 80 % .</detailed_description>
