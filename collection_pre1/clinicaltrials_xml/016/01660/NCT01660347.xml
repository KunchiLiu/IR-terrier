	<detailed_description>Successful engraftment allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) define actual neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 500 10^6/L self-sustaining platelet count 20 x 10^9/L . ANC recovery usually occur 14 21 day infusion donor HSCs red cell platelet recovery typically follow within time frame , although resolution anemia may occur last . Recovery time dose dependent , one report , donor HSC aliquot contain 1.9 20.5 10^6/kg CD34+ cell result ANC &gt; 500 10^6/L median 12 day 16 day patient receive filgrastim versus receive white cell growth factor . In trial , self-sustaining platelet count 20 x 10^9/L occur median time 15 11 day respectively . The result another trial compare outcome patient receive mobilized peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) versus receive marrow donor show median time ANC &gt; 500 10^6/L self-sustaining platelet count 20 x 10^9/L 16 13 day respectively group receive PBSCs 21 19 day receive marrow . Similar HSC dos associate successful engraftment time frame demonstrated trial . Most transplant center require minimum dose 1 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg achieve adequate count recovery reasonable time frame post HSCT , although early trial examine recovery autologous reinfusion HSCs demonstrate threshold 2.5 x 10^6/kg CD 34 cell associate consistent rapid WBC platelet recovery time ( 18 14 day respectively ) . A late trial assess autologous PBSC mobilization breast cancer patient show HSC dos ≥ 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg associate 85 % probability WBC platelet recovery day 14 , dose 2 x 10^6 less , 10 % patient platelet recovery beyond day +28 . While precise dose HSCs successful engraftment allogeneic set know , patient characteristic myelofibrosis and/or splenomegaly likely cause interpatient variation minimum number HSCs need successful engraftment . In addition , donor factor mismatch size recipient biologic variation number HSCs obtain individual donor , create deficit amount HSCs require robust count recovery particular recipient . All factor contribute poor functional numeric cell dose result pancytopenia HSCT . Drugs require prophylaxis treatment GVHD infection myelotoxic effect post HSCT , unlike use solid organ transplantation , marrow toxic effect drug potentially severe longer lasting presence newly reconstitute immune system . While many drug negative effect marrow function HSCT , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) ganciclovir two commonly use agent potential cause cytopenia . After hydrolysis active form , mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , MMF inhibit T B cell proliferation make use valuable prevention graft versus host host versus graft reaction post HSCT , especially conjunction calcineurin inhibitor . Levels MPA increase presence alter renal function , commonly use post HSCT drug include acyclovir , ganciclovir , valaganciclovir , tacrolimus . A major side effect MMF pancytopenia , particularly neutropenia , exacerbate high drug level . Due find wide interpatient variability drug exposure , recently recommend monitoring MPA level would result well therapeutic outcome , although MPA drug level commonly obtain yet clinical practice . Myelotoxicity drug observe renal transplantation presence non-transplanted immune system demonstrate potent myelosuppression associate drug , increased toxicity patient abnormal renal function . Patients post HSCT treat multiple drug increase MPA level alter creatinine clearance , thereby highly susceptible marrow toxic effect drug result cytopenia . Ganciclovir valganciclovir , rapidly convert ganciclovir intestinal mucosal cell hepatocytes ganciclovir , inhibitor DNA synthesis . Ganciclovir known myelotoxic drug effective prophylaxis treatment cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection transplant recipient . Salzberger et al . examine outcomes engraftment day +100 post HSCT 278 patient receive ganciclovir find 41 % patient receive drug ANC le 1000 10^6/L least 2 consecutive day . Hyperbilirubinemia first 20 day HSCT , elevate serum creatinine day +21 , low marrow cellularity day +21 +28 significant risk factor neutropenia . Patients 3 risk factor 57 % chance develop neutropenia , significantly associate decrease overall event free survival . As noted , concomitant use ganciclovir MMF increase serum concentration drug exacerbate marrow toxicity . Because CMV life-threatening disease post HSCT , often necessary use ganciclovir especially presence renal failure exacerbate use foscarnet , alternate drug CMV treatment . Therefore , ganciclovir-induced pancytopenia may unavoidable certain context . Other medication potentially toxic effect marrow alone combination commonly use agent may contribute development post HSCT cytopenia include levetiracetam , methotrexate , antibiotic linezolid , vancomycin , amoxicillin , cephalosporin , cidofovir , gabapentin . In addition insufficient allogeneic cell dose medication toxicity , infection post HSCT also result persistent cytopenia . Reactivation human herpes virus 6 ( HHV-6 ) CMV particular associate pancytopenia . HHV-6 reactivate median 20 day post-HSCT active infection show almost 50 % patient . The clinical syndrome associate active HHV-6 infection varies intensity may include encephalitis , rash , interstitial pneumonitis , secondary graft failure . A transient , clinically insignificant HHV-6 reactivation occur many patient symptoms HHV-6 infection heterogenous therefore less recognize , disease may become severe prior recognition reactivation require treatment . HHV-6 become chronically active associate secondary graft failure , pure red cell aplasia well . CMV reactivation post HSCT period also accompany acute syndrome manifest fever , myalgia , suppress marrow function . Leukopenia start CMV therapy associate poor response anti-viral therapy risk factor progression CMV viremia CMV disease . While serious manifestation CMV disease relate pulmonary enteral infection CMV-induced marrow suppression marrow failure describe , identification specific genotype CMV highly associate mortality pancytopenia . Because CMV treatment CMV associate post HSCT cytopenia , often difficult distinguish two major etiological factor . Although pathophysiology unclear , persistent cytopenia post HSCT also associate acute chronic GVHD , bacterial fungal infection , impaired hepatic renal function . Because failure hematopoietic recovery HSCT associate compromised patient survival , protocol develop provide patient persistent cytopenia post HSCT boost original donor ' HSCs improve peripheral blood count .</detailed_description>
