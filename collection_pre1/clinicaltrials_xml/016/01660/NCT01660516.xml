	<brief_title>Effect Tea Endothelial Function Ischaemia-reperfusion Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Occlusion artery ( cause ischemia ) frequently report condition , e.g . myocardial infarction , cerebral infarction organ transplantation . The period ischemia follow reperfusion ( possibly operation ) . The ischaemic period well reperfusion associate damage tissue , include endothelium . It hypothesise production oxidative stress reduce NO bioactivity ( increased reactive oxygen production ) ischaemia reperfusion involve development tissue damage endothelium . Interventions prevent attenuate endothelial dysfunction response ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) -injury potential clinical relevance prevent ( complication ) cardiovascular disease . Several study examine effect tea consumption endothelial function . These study demonstrate dose-dependent improvement tea improve endothelial function healthy diseased human , possibly vasoactive effect flavonoid , may involve increase nitric oxide bioactivity inhibition NADPH oxidase . Based ability flavonoid decrease ( impact ) oxidative stress , tea consumption may also impact upon decrease endothelial function IR-injury . However , previous study directly examine potential tea impact upon change endothelial function IR-injury . Objective : To examine whether tea consumption counteract endothelial damage response ischaemia reperfusion injury healthy human . Main study parameter : Change endothelial function ( measure flow mediate dilation ) ischaemia reperfusion injury ( induced 20 minute ischemia 20 min reperfusion ) without precedence tea consumption . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Non-invasive cuff occlusion use examine endothelial function ( 5-minute ischaemia ) produce stimulus induces ischaemia-reperfusion injury ( 20-minute ischaemia ) . This repeated cuff inflation non-invasive associate health risk subject . Tea consumption safe , likely , daily routine participant . The difference study monitor instruct participant regard tea consumption week precede test . The volunteer benefit directly participate study .</detailed_description>
