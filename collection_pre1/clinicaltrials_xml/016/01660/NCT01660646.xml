	<brief_title>Determining Impact Enhanced Case Finding Tuberculosis Notification The Gambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB chronic , transmissible disease , albeit effective curative combination therapeutic regimen available . However insufficient case detection , delay diagnosis TB , prolong duration potential transmission , co prevalent HIV/AIDS major factor responsible increase TB incidence . The DOTs strategy , rely process passive TB case finding , help control TB many part world . Currently , World Health Organisation 's Stop TB DOTS policy question country reach maintained target 70 % case detection 85 % cure rate unable demonstrate decline number case notify . Studies Southern Africa suggest investigator want prevent TB HIV-infected uninfected people major focus decrease transmission people HIV-negative may transmit TB long time account delay diagnosis 5 , 6 . Data study Ethiopia , Peru , Brazil , Zimbabwe show different strategy intensify active case finding ( ICF ACF ) yield significantly TB case standard care-passive case finding.7-10 In Zimbabwe study , point prevalence TB decline significantly 2 time point attribute ICF intervention . Since effective treatment TB render patient non-infectious within 2-4 week , likely early diagnosis initiation treatment ultimately reduce incidence TB interrupt TB transmission . However quantitative effect enhance case finding ( ECF ) TB case notification rate , TB transmission , prevalence incidence remain largely unproven . Although data Zimbabwe regard impact untargeted active case find strategy , unclear case find strategy compare standard passive case find investigator currently unable address cost effectiveness otherwise active case find strategy high TB burden setting low HIV prevalence scenario West African country include The Gambia . Consequently , insufficient data support policy change urgent need evidence drive necessary review policy . The hypothesis cluster randomize trial enhance case finding ( ECF ) strategy increase TB case notifications The Gambia reduce TB burden study area cost effective manner . The impact ECF community household transmission TB also assess . The investigator hope trial contribute evidence base . The timing alongside nationwide TB prevalence survey particularly benefit would provide baseline disease burden investigator may able compare case notification case detection select cluster .</detailed_description>
