	<brief_summary>Since laparoscopic inguinal hernia introduce 1990 , become commonly performed hernia repair NSW . Traditionally do 3 small incision : 2 cm incision navel insertion camera two 1 cm incision navel insertion trocars dissect instrument insert perform repair . Although method show relatively safe efficient report bowel vascular injury insertion small trocars usually sharp . These cause serious injury . Since 2009 , new method perform key hole repair develop . This involve place special single port navel via 2-2.5cm incision 3 blunt trocars insert . This negate risk injury sharp trocars . In addition fact single incision use could potentially result less pain , reduce incidence wound complication include infection improve cosmetic result . However potential advantage proven rigorous clinical study single port technique still relatively new . It hop study prove single port technique least effective efficient conventional technique cure hernia may additional benefit enumerate . Neither surgeon know procedure ( three port single port hernia repair ) already asleep operating room random number select process automatically assign one procedure . Sometimes possible perform single port safely case procedure convert three port procedure . All patient surgical treatment groin hernia Holroyd Private Hospital subject careful assessment study . All patient request report immediately problem . Any problem would normally report treat surgeon primary responsibility care . Problems report directly Holroyd Private Hospital . Any information medical record subject stringent confidentiality requirement . The hospital bound Australian Privacy Council Charter regard confidentiality privacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Comparing Single Multiport Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare Laparoscopic TEP repair inguinal/femoral hernia use traditional three port newer single port technique . Laparoscopic hernia repair first introduced 1990 . The uptake rate slow start 1994 9.7 % inguinal hernia perform laparoscopically However , 2009 , figure stand 40 % Australia-wide . ( www.medicareaustralia.gov.au ) . Indeed , NSW figure stand 48 % , mean common operation perform inguinal hernia State . Up 2009 , laparoscopic hernia repair involve insertion 3 port : 10mm port infra-umbilical region camera via 2 cm incision 2 x 5mm work port usually midline dissect instrument via 2 x 10mm incision . These port call secondary trocars usually sharp . Their insertion potential cause bowel vascular injury . The European Hernia Society guideline ( www.herniaweb.org ) treatment inguinal hernia show ( conventional ) endoscopic technique associate high rate port-site hernias visceral injury especially learn curve period . A recent study 37,000 gynaecological laparoscopy US show bowel injury rate 0.16 % ; third lead death patient . 22 % bowel injury result insertion secondary trocars ( www.danaise.com/vascular_and_bowel_injuries_duri.htm ) . Another report large hernia centre US show first 300 transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAPP ) repair 2 bowel injury ( one bladder injury ) observe . Indeed , investigator change technique TEP repair also observe 2 bowel injury ( one bladder injury ) first 300 TEP repair . ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178763 ) Therefore bowel vascular injury laparoscopic surgery real often report . Single incision laparoscopic surgery , instrument place single port , primary aim prevent vascular bowel injury use completely blunt trocars . The first case laparoscopic TEP repair report 2009 . Since handful report . The principle author , Dr Hanh Tran , perform single incision laparoscopic hernia repair since October 2009 . To date , perform excess 100 case excellent result term success cure hernia ( recurrence observe patient although follow-up 1 year ) , complication include wound infection , high patient satisfaction excellent cosmetic result . However Dr Tran 's experience best audit . The high level scientific evidence regard efficacy safety one procedure versus another come prospective randomise control study two procedure compare patient ( informed consent ) undergo either procedure random ( blind ) fashion . It propose 100 patient enrol study 50 patient arm study ie 50 patient undergo TEP repair use conventional three port 50 single port technique . The TEP inguinal hernia repair exactly procedures except single port technique one ( 1.5-2cm ) infra-umbilical incision require . While first 100 case perform SILS ( TM ) port require relatively large infraumbilical incision . The availability Triport ( TM ) allow equally small small infraumbilical incision would suit patient rather naturally large umbilicus . Over 180 TEP inguinal hernia repair perform Triport commencement trial ensure learn curve truly pass . Therefore use Triport allow one inconspicuous incision compare three incision conventional multiport inguinal hernia repair possible improve cosmetic result . The main disadvantage single port technique relative loss triangulation principle author show overcome use longer small laparoscope ( Holroyd Private Hospital buy two specifically purpose ) , different dissect technique increase experience . Therefore , surgeon experience technique operation success compromise inadequate dissection . The author ( perform nearly 2000 TEP repair past 10 year ) believe learn curve single port TEP hernia repair highly experienced TEP surgeon around 25-50 ie number operation time approach standard three port TEP repair . He perform excess 100 Single Port Incision Laparoscopic hernia repair past year . Therefore success operation patient either arm study compromise lack experience . The follow patient different follow protocol Sydney Hernia Clinic . This standard follow consistent normal clinical practice . In summary , goal simple . ( ) To perform laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair use either conventional three port single port technique ; ( ii ) To assess efficacy new single port technique rigorous scientific manner ; ( iii ) To report unexpected problem complication ; ( iv ) To follow patient treat laparoscopically ensure single port technique good result well term cure hernia ( absence recurrence hernia ) less complication well cosmetic result achieve traditional 3-ports technique use .</detailed_description>
