	<brief_summary>Currently standard treatment early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia total hysterectomy ( operation remove uterus ) removal ovary . While highly effective , surgery carry significant side effect : - young woman still wish child would lose fertility ; - woman one disorder ( disease ) addition early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia and/or morbid obesity risk surgical complication make surgery unsafe . This study access new approach treatment endometrial cancer spare woman undergo major surgery may unwanted unnecessary . Mirena approve Australia contraception , treat heavy bleeding , prevent thicken line uterus ( endometrial hyperplasia ) oestrogen replacement therapy ( HRT ) . However approve treat early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia . This research project test see Mirena effective treatment early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia . Metformin approve Australia treat Diabetes . However approve treat early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia . Therefore , experimental treatment early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia . This mean must test see effective treatment early stage endometrial cancer endometrial hyperplasia atypia . Weight loss intervention feasible safe , already implement gynaecologic oncologist make woman eligible surgery . Weight loss 7 % body weight induces large biological effect ( example reduces incidence diabetes 58 % , hypertension 26 % ) .</brief_summary>
