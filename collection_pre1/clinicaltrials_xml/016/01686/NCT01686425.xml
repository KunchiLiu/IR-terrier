	<brief_title>Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography Versus Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Biliary Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Advanced biliary tract malignancy complicate obstructive jaundice traditionally manage palliative stent placement ERCP . In 3-12 % patient advanced disease tumour involvement small bowel peri-ampullary region may preclude use ERCP necessitate percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ( PTBD ) surgery1 . However technique associate high complication rate significant morbidity2 . PTBD necessitate traverse parietal visceral peritoneum cause potential bile leak bleed peritoneal cavity . This procedure also associate significant pain , lengthy hospital stay overall reduction quality life , even procedure related mortality . Indeed Society Interventional Radiology ( SIR ) quality improvement guideline establish procedural risk severe major complication include sepsis , bleed procedural relate death 2.5 % less severe complication include pain prolong hospital admission 20 % . In recent year various group describe endoscopic ultrasound guide access left system allow placement metal plastic stent either across distal stricture deploy stent stomach ( hepatico-gastrostomy ) , high technical success3 . Retrograde cannulation normally perform duodenal bulb allow access biliary tract malignant stricture intent either pas guide wire papilla perform rendezvous procedure , placement cover metal stent stomach ( choledochoenterostomy ) 10 . Cannulation dilate segment 2 3 sectoral duct also possible proximal stomach endoscopist performs procedure antegrade fashion5 . Currently procedures selectively perform centre expert endoscopists mainly tertiary care academic expert centre include Leuven . Collectively EUS biliary drainage technically successful 75-92 % case , however report bile leak peritonitis described5 . Various obstacle however still exist extend general applicability technique outside expert centre . Firstly , randomize control trial exist compare safety efficacy EUS biliary access Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography ( PTC ) . Secondly , current endoscopic technique utilize standard endoscopic accessory specifically develop utilized within biliary system advance gastric wall . Thirdly , specific EUS strategy need prevent reduce complication associate percutaneous approach . Concept preliminary experimental data Hypothesis Based literature hypothesize : - Endoscopic ultrasound guide biliary drainage effective percutaneous biliary drainage management obstructive jaundice - EUS guide biliary drainage associate reduce incidence major ( bile peritonitis , procedure relate mortality , hematobilia ) minor ( abdominal pain , prolong hospital stay ) complication . - EUS guide biliary drainage cost effective compare percutaneous biliary drainage Aims propose research Based current literature propose randomize pilot study assess follow specific end point - EUS biliary drainage effective percutaneous biliary drainage achieve resolution cholestasis - EUS biliary drainage associate increase risk complication compare percutaneous biliary drainage . Methodology Study population . Patients obstructive jaundice due locally advanced/metastatic malignancy dilate intrahepatic bile duct recruit department Gastroenterology Hepatology University Hospital Leuven . This population fail ERCP consider ERCP possible due alter surgical anatomy . Patients randomize either PTC EUS guide biliary drainage Inclusion criterion : - Patients older 18 year present malignant obstructive jaundice - Locally advanced primary metastatic malignancy involve biliary tract - Patients ERCP fail ERCP possible due surgically altered anatomy ( eg . Post-Whipple ) . Exclusion criterion : â€¢ Resectable biliary tract malignancy curative intent Endoscopic method Linear array endoscopic ultrasound ( Pentax , Pentax Hitachi , Montvale , NJ ) use identify dilate left system . The Doppler mode use differentiate intrahepatic bile duct portal hepatic vein branch . A 19G needle ( Echo-19 , Cook , Limerick , Ireland ) use puncture peripherally locate dilate segment 2 3 duct EUS guidance . Under fluoroscopic control cholangiogram obtain standard 0.035 guide-wire ( Hydra Jag wire , Boston Scientific , Natick , MA Boston Scientific ) advance biliary system . Next 6Fr cystotome ( Endoflex , Voerde , Germany ) use create trans-gastric tract liver parenchyma dilate biliary system . The guidewire manipulate across stricture duodenal lumen . A Hurricane biliary dilation balloon 4cm x4mm ( Boston Scientific , Natick , MA Boston Scientific ) advance tract use dilate common bile duct stricture without balloon dilation level gastric wall liver interface . A 10mmx 80mm uncovered self expandable metallic stent ( SEMS ) advance deploy fluoroscopy across papilla past duodenal obstruction present . In patient leave ductal system dilate , biliary access obtain duodenal bulb cover metal stent deploy stomach ( choledocho-enterostomy ) . In patient duodenal obstruction Wallstent place session part standard care . Novel research perspective expect outcomes - Our research address difficult clinical problem unique way : compare standard care biliary drainage procedure ( PTC ) EUS guide biliary drainage . - We expect demonstrate EUS guide biliary drainage effective PTC - We also expect show EUS guide biliary drainage associate reduced incidence complication reduce hospital stay . Study endpoints - Primary endpoint - Pain : Post-procedural pain measure visual analogue score ( VAS ) 2 , 24 , 72 hour follow procedure - Biochemical change : Bilirubin decrease 2 4 week - Secondary endpoint - Major complication include bile leak , bleeding , sepsis death - Duration procedure minute - Length ICU hospital stay - Minor complication Statistics power calculation It assume 50 % patient experience prolong pain PTC define pain last 48 hour require analgesic . 48 patient total ( 24 per group ) need detect 80 % power difference EUS , expect 10 % patient prolong pain EUS . The sample size calculation base two-sided Fisher 's Exact test ( alpha=5 % ) . To compensate potential dropout , 7 additional patient total recruited . Therefor sample size comprise 55 patient . Exact 95 % confidence interval calculate proportion major complication group . Proportions compare use Fisher 's Exact test . A Mann-Whitney U test use compare actual VAS score change VAS score group . A log-rank test use compare length hospital stay ( LOS ) , censor potential deceased patient value exceed high observed LOS . P-values small 0.05 consider significant . Statistical analysis perform use SAS software , version 9.2 SAS System Windowsld give define endpoint .
