Unfortunately , psychologist train provide treatment , limit Veterans ' access care , especially Veterans remote rural area . This project evaluate ability deliver psychotherapy group Veterans video teleconferencing . Groups Veterans PTSD chronic insomnia receive psychotherapy treatment either meeting in-person psychologist psychologist deliver treatment video teleconferencing .

	<detailed_description>Objectives ( ) : The investigator conduct randomize , control trial Veterans PTSD chronic insomnia determine cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBT-I ) administer video teleconferencing clinically inferior in-person treatment term improvement insomnia symptom . Secondary aim 1 ) comparing difference cost quality-adjusted life year treatment delivery approach 2 ) determine effectiveness CBT-I functional outcome , sleep quality , non-sleep-related PTSD symptom . The investigator also conduct patient- provider-focused formative evaluation CBT-I delivery video teleconferencing assess potential barrier widespread implementation . Research Design : This prospective randomize control non-inferiority study determine Veterans PTSD chronic insomnia receive CBT-I video teleconferencing improvement insomnia severity , determine change Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) score , clinically inferior Veterans receive in-person CBT-I . Differences cost quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) group also compare . Methodology : Veterans PTSD chronic insomnia receive primary care community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOC ) affiliate Philadelphia VAMC randomize receive one follow intervention group set CBOC : 1 ) manual-based CBT-I program deliver via video teleconferencing , 2 ) CBT-I program deliver in-person , 3 ) in-person delivery sleep hygiene education , know active control intervention . Participants assess baseline , 2 week every 3 month follow intervention . The primary outcome measure Aim 1 change Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) score 6 month follow intervention . Non-inferiority analysis use compare effectiveness two delivery method , pre-specified margin . Results ascertain via intent treat per-protocol procedure . The investigator hypothesize change ISI score follow CBT-I video teleconferencing clinically inferior follow in-person delivery . In Aim 2 , VA non-VA total healthcare cost collect test whether average cost low Veterans receive CBT-I video teleconferencing versus in-person care . Preference assess EuroQol Health Utilities Index 2 . Differences ratio cost quality-adjusted life year save CBT-I video teleconferencing in-person encounter compare test hypothesis video teleconferencing low cost equivalent outcomes . Aim 3 assess effect CBT-I functional outcome ( Short Form-12 , Work Social Adjustment Scale ) , sleep quality ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , sleep diary wrist actigraphy ) , PTSD severity ( non-sleep component PTSD Checklist-Military ) . The investigator hypothesize functional outcome sleep quality measure improve follow method CBT-I delivery CBT-I improve non-sleep-related PTSD severity . The formative evaluation telemedicine delivery CBT-I Aim 4 use qualitative ( targeted focus group participant therapist interview ) quantitative measure ( Work Alliance Inventory , Treatment Credibility Scale , attrition ) help guide future implementation CBT-I video teleconferencing Anticipated Findings : The investigator believe result demonstrate : 1 ) Veterans CBT-I group similar improvement functional outcome , 2 ) treatment delivery video teleconferencing cost effective in-person care . These finding lead wide acceptance video teleconferencing , thereby increase patient access care reduce treatment cost .</detailed_description>
