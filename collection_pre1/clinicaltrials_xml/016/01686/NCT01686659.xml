	<brief_summary>This multi-center cluster-randomized trial follow Specific Aims : - To evaluate continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring reduce RBC transfusion patient undergo surgery associate significant risk bleeding . - To evaluate patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin experience le frequent complication shorter hospital stay compare patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin . Accordingly , study hypothesis define follow : - The primary null hypothesis continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring reduce RBC transfusion patient undergo surgery associate significant risk bleeding . - The secondary hypothesis patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin , earlier warn critical drop hemoglobin , thus , less frequent complication compare patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This matched-pair cluster-randomized control trial . At participate center , consent eligible Anesthesiologists group match pair base practice characteristic experience ( namely , main surgical service/procedures year experience work clinician responsible make transfusion decision ) . From pair , Anesthesiologists randomly allocate either treat patient access data continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring device ( total hemoglobin [ SpHb ] Pleth Variability Index [ PVI ] ) ( SpHb group ) without access SpHb/PVI data , standard care ( control group ) . Regardless randomization , patient monitor device data blind available Anesthesiologist use management control group . Only SpHb group , SpHb/PVI data provide live Anesthesiologist , use management patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patient undergo one listed major surgery associate possibility significant blood loss Consenting patient primarily manage consent Anesthesiologists participate study ( Not applicable participate center obtain waiver inform consent patient respective IRB ) At least one finger available accessible perform noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring ( preoperative perfusion index great 0.5 ) Any patient fit criterion use sensor , specifically , patient nail polish and/or nail deformity , obstruct physical access ( e.g . due bandage ) finger would use sensor placement , manner interferes satisfactory sensor placement Any patient monitor motor evoke potential device Any patient know hemoglobinopathy Any patient undergoing CardioPulmonary Bypass ( CPB ) Any patient transfuse refused consent blood transfusion Patients moribund/salvage case determine participate Anesthesiologist charge management patient operate room Patients treat artificial oxygen carrier within 30 day hospital stay Patients actively enrol within 30 day completion study ( except purely observational study intervention ) Patients manage outside operating room participate center , operate room condition conducive perform complete study procedure ( include use hemoglobin monitoring device ) Patients young 18 year old Patients pregnant Any patient expect receive transfusion preoperatively</criteria>
