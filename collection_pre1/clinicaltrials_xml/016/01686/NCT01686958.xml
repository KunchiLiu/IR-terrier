	<brief_title>Safety Study MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation Prostate Tissue Treat Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Profound Medical Inc. develop novel technology call MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system . The technology develop patient organ confined prostate cancer . The therapeutic endpoint technology thermal coagulation prostate tissue . The treatment conduct completely within MRI suite , enable real-time temperature image heat region acquire ultrasonic treatment deliver . Using MRI thermometry treatment , dynamic temperature feedback control intensity ultrasound beam rotation Ultrasound Applicator shape pattern thermal coagulation accurately precisely prostate gland , thereby reduce risk possible damage important surround anatomy rectum , urinary sphincter , neurovascular bundle pelvic bone . This coagulation method , therefore , potential low complication rate conventional therapy .</detailed_description>
