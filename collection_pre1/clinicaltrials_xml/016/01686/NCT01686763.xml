	<brief_summary>Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) seem involved pathogenesis cerebral vasospasm subarachnoid hemorrhage . However measurements cerebrospinal fluid concentration ( CSF ) ET-1 sensitive enough predict development vasospasm represent average value throughout entire cerebral circulation . Cerebral microdialysis ( MD ) technique able detect molecule concentration small perivascular area . The investigator perform prospective observational clinical study test hypothesis MD ET-1 concentration sensitive predictor vasospasm . Patients subarachnoid hemorrhage high risk vasospasm accord Fisher scale admit ICU consecutively study . All patient receive surgery within 48 hour bleed ; MD probe place area risk vasospasm surgery sample hourly collect analysed measure lactate , piruvate glutamate level ; ET-1 level CSF MD fluid measure admission day 7 . At admission 7 day two angiography perform detect degree extent vasospasm , Transcranial Doppler neurological evaluation daily perform . Patients classify accord presence vasospasm 3 group : absence vasospasm ( NV ) , presence vasospasm ( CV ) , acute neurological deterioration ( AND ) .</brief_summary>
