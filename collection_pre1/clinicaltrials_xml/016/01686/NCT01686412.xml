	<brief_summary>This exploratory study , national , unicentric , double-blind , conduct Institute Teaching Research Hospital Sírio-Libanês order detect possible autonomic response result Exposure Electromagnetic Fields Low Energy ( EEFLE ) healthy subject patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma patient advance breast carcinoma . Autonomic response describe patient cancer exposure EEFLE . This autonomic response , biofeedback , due exposure EEFLE seem associate specific set modulation frequency apply patient malignancy . Moreover , healthy individual expose modulate EEFLE specific set frequency appear autonomic response . Biofeedback define change amplitude radial pulse exposure EEFLE , modulate accord set specific frequency . This phenomenon yet fully elucidate . In exploratory survey one patient observe change pressure pulse immediately start exposure EEFLE , modulate accord set specific frequency record digital photoplethysmography . This study aim evaluate autonomic response individual expose single moment , electromagnetic field . This study intend study diagnostic therapeutic procedure . For reason , evolutive clinical data consider study .</brief_summary>
