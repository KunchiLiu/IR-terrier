	<detailed_description>The study design verify product safety , determine optimal imaging time , gather efficacy data radioactive drug product ( Technetium Tc 99m EC20 ) , assay mass presence folate receptor , woman suspect ovarian endometrial cancer . Twelve subject enrol , minimum five malignant case , determine histopathological evaluation . Women suspect ovarian endometrial mass either 1 ) fix , paraffin embed tissue sample ( ) available immunohistochemical staining obtain previous pathological evaluation 2 ) schedule procedure obtain tissue pathological evaluation fix paraffin embed immunohistochemical staining eligible study . The ovarian mass may either initial finding , e.g. , find routine pelvic examination investigate symptom , ovarian endometrial mass may find suspicious recurrent residual tumor follow-up examination surgical resection confirm ovarian endometrial cancer . Patients may pregnant breastfeed enrollment .</detailed_description>
