	<brief_summary>The underlie concept behind feasibility trial achieve reduction indoor smoke biomass fuel minimize change cook practice prompt one two improve , ventilate cookstove selection choice . Typical fuel source use develop country include wood , dry dung , agricultural waste . The investigator propose reduce indoor air pollution replace household traditional cookstove improve design incorporates follow key element : - Burner opening customize size shape cooking vessel home . - Flue design draw air fire box cook pot pas chimney . - A chimney adequate height create draft vent exterior . - An exterior port bidirectional opening prevent backflow smoke . - An access port chimney permit clean soot . The investigator propose use two type improve cookstove meet criterion . As part piloting activity , investigator test several different type commercially-available cookstove chimney , may also want test locally-made improve cookstove . The investigator want evaluate design compare ability reduce indoor air pollution , reliability cookstove type , function time , logistics import/build locally , preference cultural compatibility , cost . The investigator select two type improve cookstove use feasibility trial . The study design crossover intervention trial patient first run-in observational period 4 month traditional cookstove prior randomization . At baseline , investigator obtain sociodemographic information household , respiratory outcome health data participate woman , cook time practice include type fuel use . All 40 patient site receive two type improve cookstove , one : 20 randomize receive first type cookstove chimney 20 first receive second type improve cookstove chimney . The patient follow 4 month crossover . The investigator assess cook behavioral practice compliance cookstove use monthly , respiratory environmental measure mid-point 4 month period minimize carry-over effect . At end second 4 month period , investigator switch order improve cookstove follow participant another 4 month . The investigator assess behavior , compliance , respiratory environmental measure . The study expect require 12 month complete .</brief_summary>
