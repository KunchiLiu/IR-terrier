	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass change language processing patient chronic , post-stroke aphasia follow application brain stimulation . The brain stimulation investigator administer call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . It involve pass weak electrical current brain two electrode form damp sponge . One sponge place specified area damage leave hemisphere , sponge place right scalp . Computer-controlled speech-language treatment administer application tDCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Stimulation Aphasia Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause adult disability United States . Approximately one-third stroke result acute language impairment ( aphasia ) , approximately one-fifth suffer chronic aphasia . Unfortunately , prognosis moderate severe chronic aphasia remain grim , current behavioral treatment approach usually offer limited-to-modest benefit . Recent advancement understand relationship low current electrical brain stimulation cortical plasticity suggest effect behavioral aphasia treatment could possibly enhance use anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( A-tDCS ) . Indeed , show A-tDCS significantly boost effect behavioral aphasia treatment . Based result well study aim understanding favorable brain plasticity correlate positive treatment outcome aphasia , propose conduct Phase II clinical trial utilize futility design . Consistent goal Program Announcement PAR-08-204 National Institute Deafness Other Communication Disorders ( NIDCD ) , plan `` evaluate whether sufficient evidence short term improvement human justify phase III trial .
