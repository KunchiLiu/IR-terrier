	<brief_summary>Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) regard one `` epidemic '' western world . DM contribute severe morbidity mortality due damage target organ ( neuropathy , vasculopathy , nephropathy , retinopathy ) . It affect quality life patient increase rate blindness , IHD , stroke , end stage renal failure , hemodialysis lower limb amputation ( LLA ) .The Diabetic Foot ( DF ) define destruction infection tissue/s foot diabetic patient due neurological damage / different level Peripheral Vascular Disease ( PVD ) . Diabetic foot complication common cause low extremity amputation industrialize world . The lifetime occurence Diabetic Foot Ulcers ( DFU ) 20 % diabetic patient . Between 15 % - 25 % foot ulcer lead low limb amputation . It show Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) could effective therapy many disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome , spinal cord injury , liver injury critical limb ischemia . Stem cell obtain either patient ( autologous ) non-related healthy donor ( allogeneic ) . The purpose study determine safety efficacy culture Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells ( BM-MSCs ) allogeneic donor treatment chronic leg wound diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
