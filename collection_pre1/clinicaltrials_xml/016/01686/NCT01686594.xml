	<brief_title>PUVA Maintenance Therapy Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Psoralen plus UVA ( PUVA ) photochemotherapy consist topical oral application psoralen , follow exposure UVA light . PUVA use various condition , include early stage mycosis fungoides ( MF ) primary secondary lymphoproliferative disorder . PUVA strong pro-apoptotic immunomodulating property , exact mechanism PUVA lead clearance MF well understood . Although MF generally slowly progress disease , ultimately spread lymphoid tissue , peripheral blood , organ , lead death . Previous Work : PUVA therapy well-accepted first-line treatment option skin-limited MF ( stage IA , IB , IIA ) , lead complete remission high portion patient ( approximately 70 90 % ) . Long-term remission achieve PUVA certain percentage patient . However , case MF lesion relapse stop PUVA variable time interval median time relapse 14 17 month , accord experience . Not little know therapeutic mechanism PUVA MF little know optimal duration frequency treatment ( 2 , 3 , 4 time weekly ) , dose escalation , maintenance therapy . Although PUVA introduce 30 year ago , lack prospective control study clearly define dose scheme also ongoing controversy whether PUVA maintenance therapy may prolong disease remission MF upon initial complete clearance . Hypothesis &amp; Intended Work : We hypothesize PUVA prolongs disease free survival MF patient . In randomized multicenter trial involve 9 center Austria , plan investigate ( 1 ) clinical efficacy PUVA maintenance therapy MF , ( 2 ) mechanism PUVA lead disease clearance . In total , 82 patient enrol treated defined PUVA regimen 2 exposure per week 12 week . After 12 week PUVA treatment , patient complete remission randomize two arm . In Arm A patient treated PUVA maintenance therapy constant single UVA dos . Maintenance treatment give week one month ( 4 week ) , every 2 week 2 month ( 8 week ) three month month 6 month . After 9 month maintenance therapy patient discontinue therapy . Patients Arm B receive therapy . Thereafter , patient follow recurrence least 12 month ( non-recurrent patient ) primary study analysis do . In addition , follow-up extend 60 month long-term result . The mechanistic action PUVA study laboratory investigation , include immune function cytokine analysis . Outlook : A good understanding optimal regimen therapeutic mechanism PUVA MF help improve treatment strategy life-threatening disease . The understanding mode action PUVA MF may also help develop novel treatment use PUVA-affected pathway , allow achieve overall good long-term response success .</detailed_description>
