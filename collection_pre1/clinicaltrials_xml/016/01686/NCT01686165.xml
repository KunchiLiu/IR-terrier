	<brief_summary>This study look effect ( good bad ) drug call PXD-101 ( belinostat ) combination radioactive drug Zevalin ( yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ) patient relapse aggressive ( high-risk ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Studies laboratory suggest drug PXD101 act upon specific cancer cell process cause either death cancer cell prevention growth . In human study small number patient lymphoma , PXD-101 show ability shrink slow tumor growth . When Zevalin deliver directly tumor , lymphoma cell destroy may result disappearance tumor ( remission )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document complete response rate overall response patient relapse aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat two cycle PXD-101 follow one cycle Zevalin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 2-year progression-free survival patient relapse aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat two cycle PXD-101 follow one cycle Zevalin . II . To evaluate toxicity two cycle PXD-101 one cycle Zevalin patient relapse aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive belinostat intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment belinostat repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 either 7 , 8 , 9 , yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute day 50 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
