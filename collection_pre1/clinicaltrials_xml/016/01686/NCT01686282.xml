	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) continue lead cause death U.S. Americans concern blood cholesterol level dietary cholesterol intake rather overall cardiovascular health risk factor lead CVD hypertension , vascular dysfunction , inadequate consumption fruit vegetable physical activity . Statistics show approximately 91 % individual CVD vascular dysfunction attribute endothelial autonomic dysfunction lead increase arterial stiffness . The investigator long-term goal provide feasible effective dietary way pre- stage 1- hypertensive individual normalize blood pressure ( BP ) , improve vascular function thereby reduce cardiovascular risk enhance quality life . Blueberries rich source phenolic compound compound may play important role promote cardiovascular health . Considering strong possibility phytochemical present blueberry work additively synergistically , would ideal investigate cardioprotective effect blueberry whole . The investigator overall objective bring forth evidence blueberry consumption reduce BP cardiovascular risk factor include endothelial dysfunction , arterial stiffness , autonomic dysfunction pre- stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal woman . The investigator hypothesize blueberry supplementation improve vascular function lower blood pressure postmenopausal woman pre-hypertension . The finding study provide foundation disseminate feasible , safe approach prevent combat hypertension early stage require drug therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect 22 gram freeze-dried blueberry intake daily basis eight week : The purpose study examine effect 22 gram freeze-dried blueberry intake daily basis eight week arterial function blood pressure postmenopausal woman pre- stage 1-hypertension . The specific aim study : 1 . To investigate extent daily consumption 22 g blueberry drink-mix reduces blood pressure individual pre- stage 1-hypertension . 2 . To determine whether daily consumption 22 g blueberry drink-mix improve autonomic control blood pressure heart rate individual pre- stage 1-hypertension . 3 . To measure serum marker oxidative stress determine whether increase antioxidant defense part responsible blueberry 's vascular protective effect .</detailed_description>
