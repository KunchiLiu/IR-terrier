	<brief_summary>Cataract globally common cause blindness Denmark operation - 50.000 treatment per year - common eye operation . The cause cataract growth denaturation lens protein . This lead increased absorption blue light increase light scatter . This may affect newly discover cell retina involve regulation circadian rhythm . When internal circadian rhythm synchronize external day night phase-shift occurs . Most people know discomfort jet-lag , consequence may much severe heighten risk cancer cardiovascular disease . The goal project study circadian regulating cell retina affected cataract operation . Cataract patient study operation questionnaire , hormone activity measurement specialize pupil measurement measure indirect response circadian regulating cell blue light . Results study aim shed light regulatory mechanism eye circadian rhythm affect cataract . Furthermore , choice intraocular lens evaluate . This may impact clinical practise especially regard choice intraocular lens widen indication cataract surgery .</brief_summary>

Known systemic disease , may affect retina ( untreated hypertension , DM etc . ) Known systemic disease , may affect lens . Known psychiatric disease . Known sleep circadian rhythm disorder , cause lowered blue light transmission lens . Per post operative complication Use drug may affect sleep . For subpopulation also : Poor cooperation . Severe refraction abnormality . Previous eye surgery Nystagmus Congenital acquire abnormality : eye lid eye area , cornea iris . Use medicine may affect pupillary response . Use drug may affect pupillary response .</criteria>
