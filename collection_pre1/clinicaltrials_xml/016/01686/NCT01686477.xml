	<brief_summary>Mother 's Own Milk ( MOM ) recommend preterm baby . However , average , mother give birth preterm able provide less half baby 's milk requirement . Standard clinical practice make shortfall MOM either pasteurise Human Donor Milk ( HDM ) Preterm Formula ( PTF ) . Which option beneficial clinical outcome unknown . Pasteurisation reduces destroy many biologically active component HDM , unlike PTF , variable composition . Clinicians use HDM primarily hope despite pasteurisation reduce bloodstream infection necrotising enterocolitis , serious , devastate inflammatory disease characterise bowel death multisystem failure . These two fear condition newborn medicine describe . Landmark nutritional trial early 1980 's suggest positive effect human milk insulin sensitivity , metabolic outcome . Clinicians prefer PTF believe benefit growth , include brain growth , improve neurodevelopmental outcome . In order address crucial question , central preterm newborn care , multicentre United Kingdom ( UK ) -wide study randomise 4000 preterm baby would necessary achieve sufficient power evaluate impact short-term outcome necrotising enterocolitis bloodstream infection , establish cohort large enough address long-term metabolic ( obesity , type 2 diabetes ) , cardiovascular ( blood pressure ) developmental outcomes . This pilot trial evaluate practicability feasibility large multicentre UK randomise control trial . In addition evaluate feasibility ensure maximal use resource allocate , study also assess outcome indicative long term metabolic health . Neonates bear 32 week gestational age randomise receive fortified HDM , unfortified HDM , PTF make shortfall MOM 35 week postmenstrual age sample size 22 group . The trial design reflect current preterm feeding practice . The trial take place neonatal unit London parent consent obtain within 48hr birth . Permission seek long term follow , initially parent ( later child ) . Outcomes body composition use magnetic resonance image image technique . This pilot study specifically assess feasibility test 1 ) provision HDM Human Milk Banks London 2 ) acceptability parent clinicians use feedback trial design 3 ) recruitment target 4 ) retrieval clinical data recruit baby form National Neonatal Database .</brief_summary>
