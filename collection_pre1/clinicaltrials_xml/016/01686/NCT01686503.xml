	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether low dose inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) inject skin ( intradermal administration ) work equally well well standard dose injected muscle ( intramuscular administration ) . There immune cell skin muscle , vaccine show require low dose administer intradermally . The study do participant infected HIV HIV-infected people know respond less well vaccine group , particularly important know IPV might work well HIV-infected people administer intradermally . If possible low dose IPV intradermal administration , would make inactivated polio vaccine affordable develop country need</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intradermal Versus Intramuscular Polio Vaccine Booster HIV-Infected Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) sufficient eradicate polio . OPV fail provide adequate polio immunity certain immunocompromised population , people AIDS . Also , OPV mutate form neurovirulent strain capable cause polio outbreak . Inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) , mutate neurovirulent strain effective population fail respond OPV , need globally eradicate polio , unaffordable many develop country . Because immune cell skin muscle , intradermal administration IPV may way increase efficacy reduce dose ( thus cost ) IPV . We plan conduct clinical trial randomize 231 HIV-infected adult receive booster two-fifths dose intradermal IPV , one-fifth dose intradermal IPV , full dose intramuscular IPV , two-fifths dose intramuscular IPV . We measure polio immunity vaccine administration . Through study , determine optimal booster dose intradermal IPV , whether intradermal work well intramuscular IPV administration , whether intradermal IPV effective immunocompromised population . The data trial could contribute global polio eradication .</detailed_description>
