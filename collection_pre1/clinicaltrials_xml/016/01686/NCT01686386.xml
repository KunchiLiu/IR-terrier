	<brief_title>Study Bendamustine , Lenalidomide Low-dose Dexamethasone , Treatment Patients With Relapsed Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma B-cell malignancy result monoclonal proliferation plasma cell within bone marrow . According American Cancer Society , 14,600 new case multiple myeloma diagnose 2002 , account approximately 1 % new cancer case . Multiple myeloma contribute 2 % cancer deaths year ; estimate 10,800 death occur overall . The disease prevalent men twice common African-Americans Caucasians . Multiple myeloma commonly think disease old patient ; median age diagnosis 68 year , incidence increase 4 % /year old 85 year . The median survival standard treatment 3 year . Therapeutic option patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) rapidly change . The emergence two highly active novel agent , bortezomib lenalidomide , dramatically change landscape treatment option improve outcomes many patient . Combinations conventional agent novel agent also demonstrate significant efficacy patient newly diagnose relapse myeloma . Among conventional agent explore bifunctional alkylator agent bendamustine , demonstrate single-agent activity activity novel agent . Lenalidomide new immunomodulating agent effective multiple myeloma , especially associate dexamethasone melphalan prednisone . The role lenalidomide treatment relapsed/refractory patient MM establish current research focus combination lenalidomide chemotherapy improve result . Bendamustine bi-functional alkylating agent purine- like benzimidazole ring administer successfully patient MM . In vitro study show bendamustine posse unique profile activity , clearly divergent common nitrogen mustard drug . Bendamustine prednisone newly diagnose MM patient result superior complete response rate , prolonged time treatment failure improve quality life compare treatment melphalan prednisone . The role bendamustine , thalidomide prednisolone ( BPT ) patient relapse refractory disease stage II/III investigate East German Study group Hematology Oncology ( OSHO ) . The response rate high 80 % . Despite impressive efficacy lenalidomide/dexamethasone relapse MM , treat patient eventually relapse ( median Time Progression ( TTP ) expect nearly year accord result two phase III randomize study ) . Combination effective novel agent bendamustine could increase response rate TTP lenalidomide/dexamethasone induce durable response relapse refractory MM patient . The identification appropriate lenalidomide dose adopt combination bendamustine dexamethasone generation exploratory data efficacy novel combination appear important term future development even effective treatment MM .</detailed_description>
