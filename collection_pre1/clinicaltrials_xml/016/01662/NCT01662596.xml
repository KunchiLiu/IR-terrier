	<detailed_description>Major defect prevalence general population estimate 5 % live birth . In case fetus suffers structural defect , chromosomal genetic disease , prenatal diagnosis important scientific tool allow reliable advice well pregnancy outcomes . Diseases many embryonic defect detect early , include nervous system defect , heart defect , urinary tract defect , limb defect . Taking folic acid pregnancy first trim reduces incidence defect . Aneuploidy mainly trisomy 21,18,13 , Monosomy X aneuploid sex chromosome responsible chromosomal anomaly . Some aneuploidy diagnose combination nuchal translucency ( also associate cardiac abnormality ) maternal serum marker detection first trim pregnancy laboratory test second trimester . Ultrasound also tool diagnosis aneuploidity , detect abnormality characteristic `` soft sign '' suspicious chromosomal disorder . Genetic test another diagnostic tool suggest general population individual case adapt genetic disease know . In 2008 75.5 % population Israel Jews , 20.2 % Arabs , 4.3 define `` others '' . Approximately 45 % Arabs living northern region compare 10 % Jewish population . Congenital malformation lead cause death infant Arab second cause death Jewish infant . In recent year supply screen pregnancy increase , apparent rate implementation nuchal translucency , amniocentesis therefore detection disease lower Arab population , well rate take folic acid . These difference population carry test enable prevention early detection birth defect neonatal genetic disease also associate difference economic , religious age woman . In work try know population apply medical service Hillel Yaffe Hospital . Estimate rate risk factor appearance disease fetal malformation population turn hospital `` Hillel Yaffe '' examine whether difference rate early testing disease birth defect fetus . We hypothesize large percentage population turn Hillel Yaffe Hospital risk factor sick fetus Muslim population high risk Jewish population . Understanding population risk factor , allow specific reference risk factor lower eventually reduce rate congenital malformation population .</detailed_description>
