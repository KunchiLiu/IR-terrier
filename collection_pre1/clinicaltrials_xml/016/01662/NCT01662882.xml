	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enroll arm trial reserve subject AD : 1 . Japanese male female least 50 year age , probable AD accord NINCDSADRDA criterion ( McKhann et al. , 1984 ) ; 2 . Subjects mild/moderate dementia evidence MMSE score range 10 24 , boundary include , screen ; 3 . Subjects whose history cognitive decline gradual onset progressive period least 6 month . Evidence present indicating sustain memory deterioration otherwise cognitively normal subject , plus additional impairment another cognitive function : orientation , judgment problem solving , function personal care ; 4 . Subjects live regular visit responsible caregiver willing provide information subject 's cognitive status ; 5 . Subjects sign Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) approve informed consent prior study procedure . If subject incapable give informed consent , caregiver may consent behalf subject ( subject must still confirm assent ) . Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enroll arm trial reserve subject mild cognitive impairment : 1 . Japanese male female least 50 year age ; 2 . Subjects complaint memory cognitive decline corroborate informant ; 3 . Subjects Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) 0.5 ; 4 . Subjects objective cognitive impairment marginally normal cognition document history high cognitive performance ; 5 . Have obvious cause cognitive impairment ( e.g. , onset coincides recent head trauma stroke ) ; 6 . Have sufficiently preserve general cognition functional performance diagnosis AD make time screen visit ; 7 . Subjects essentially normal ADL ; 8 . Subjects demented ; 9 . Subjects MMSE score &gt; 24 ; 10 . Subjects present initial diagnosis cognitive impairment present initial diagnosis cognitive impairment within past year ; 11 . Subjects live regular visit responsible caregiver willing provide information subject 's cognitive status ; 12 . Subjects sign IRB/IEC approve informed consent prior study procedure . Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enroll arm trial reserve cognitively normal volunteer : 1 . Japanese male female least 50 year age ; 2 . Subjects MMSE score &gt; = 29 , cognitively normal base history psychometric test battery screening ; 3 . Subjects live reliable person verify cognitive status ; 4 . Subjects sign IRB/IEC approve informed consent prior study procedure . Subjects follow ineligible enroll trial : 1 . A documented diagnosis MCI great 1 year ( subject consider MCI group ) ; 2 . Neurodegenerative disorder AD , include , limited Parkinson 's disease , Pick 's disease , frontotemporal dementia , Huntington 's chorea , Down 's syndrome , CreutzfeldtJacob disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , progressive supranuclear palsy ; 3 . Have currently diagnosis dementing / neurodegenerative disease ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease , dementia Lewy body , Lewy body variant AD , etc . ) ; 4 . Have currently diagnosis mixed dementia ; 5 . Cognitive impairment result : Acute cerebral trauma posttraumatic brain injury , subdural hematoma , injury secondary chronic trauma ( e.g . sequela box ) ; Hypoxic cerebral damage regardless etiology ; e.g . cognitive neurological deficit result cardiac arrest cardiac surgery , anesthesia , severe selfpoisoning episode , secondary severe hypovolemia ( orthostatic hypotension lead exclusion ) ; Vitamin deficiency state document medical history folate , vitamin B 12 B complex deficiency ; e.g . thiamin deficiency Korsakoff 's syndrome . ( Note : subject take regular B12 folate necessarily exclude ) ; Cerebral infection include abscess , syphilis , meningitis , encephalitis AIDS ; Primary metastatic cerebral neoplasia ; Significant endocrine metabolic disease ; e.g. , thyroid , parathyroid , pituitary disease , Cushing 's syndrome , severe renal failure ; Mental retardation . Before enrol subject past current history condition , investigator must contact sponsor discus whether condition could contribute cognitive impairment . 6 . Clinically significant infarct possible multiinfarct dementia define NINCDS criterion , include : A history significant cerebrovascular event result physical neurologic deficit may confound assessment subject 's intellectual function ; Multiple focal sign neurologic examination indicative multiple ischemic episode ; One follow finding MRI scan : Multiple ( two ) infarct white matter lacunes ; A single large infarct strategically place infarct angular gyrus , thalamus , basal forebrain , posterior cerebral artery ( PCA ) anterior cerebral artery ( ACA ) territory ; Extensive periventricular white matter disease . Leukoaraiosis ( periventricular white matter , low attenuation ) distinguish multiple infarction . Leukoaraiosis common normal individual patient AD . White matter deterioration result exclusion unless abnormal widespread , e.g. , Binswanger 's disease ; 7 . Any evidence screening MRI , compute tomography ( CT ) , biomarker study suggest alternate etiology ( probable AD subject AD ) cognitive deficit ; case cognitively normal control evidence screen MRI , CT , biomarker study suggest presence AD pathology ; 8 . Current clinically significant psychiatric disease , judge Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSMIV ) criterion , particularly current major depression schizophrenia . Subjects dementia experience behavioral disturbance may require treatment psychotropic medication may enter discussion approval sponsor . The investigator sponsor carefully consider whether subject behavioral dysfunction able complete imaging session ; 9 . History epilepsy convulsion , except febrile convulsion childhood ; 10 . Clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic , endocrine disturbance ; 11 . Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease usually include one following : cardiac surgery myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; unstable angina ; coronary artery disease required increase medication within last 3 month ; decompensated congestive heart failure ; significant cardiac arrhythmia conduction disturbance , particularly result atrial ventricular fibrillation , cause syncope , near syncope , alteration mental status ; severe mitral aortic valvular disease ; uncontrolled high blood pressure ; congenital heart disease ; clinically significant abnormal result ECG , include limited QTc &gt; 450 msec . Before enrol subject condition , investigator must contact sponsor . 12 . History drug alcohol abuse within last year , prior prolonged history abuse ; 13 . Clinically significant infectious disease , include Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection previous positive test hepatitis ; 14 . Females childbearing potential surgically sterile , refrain sexual activity use reliable method contraception . Females childbearing potential must pregnant ( negative serum betahCG time screen negative urine betahCG day image ) breastfeed screen . Females must agree avoid become pregnant , must agree refrain sexual activity use reliable contraceptive method prescribe birth control IUD 24 hour follow administration florbetapir ( 18F ) ; 15 . Subjects , opinion investigator , otherwise unsuitable study type ; 16 . History relevant severe drug allergy hypersensitivity ; 17 . Subjects receive investigational medication within last 30 day . Additionally , time last dose previous experimental medication enrollment ( completion screen assessment ) must least equal 5 time terminal halflife previous experimental medication . Subjects ever participate experimental study amyloid target therapy ( e.g. , immunotherapy , secretase inhibitor ) may enrol unless demonstrated subject receive placebo course trial ; 18 . Subjects current clinically significant medical comorbidities , indicate history , physical exam , ECG ( include limit QTc &gt; 450 msec ) laboratory evaluation , might pose potential safety risk , interfere absorption metabolism study medication limit interpretation trial result . These include limited clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic endocrine disease , cancer , HIV infection AIDS ; 19 . Subjects know hypersensitivity alcohol ; 20 . Subjects receive radiopharmaceutical imaging therapy within past 7 day prior image session study .</criteria>
