	<brief_title>BRIPPED Scan Evaluation Emergency Department ( ED ) Patients With Shortness Breath</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize control trial perform convenience sample 200 patient present undifferentiated SOB academic emergency department ( ED ) ( volume 56,000 patients/year ) . Subjects exclude known history asthma , 20 week pregnant , thoraco-abdominal trauma past 72 hour . The BRIPPED pilot investigation ( IRB # 10-02-FB-0026 ) enrol 43 patient physician subject 4/30/2010 1/20/2011 . This study differ methodology pilot study reduction total number ultrasound image obtain decrease total time perform scan . Instead cohort study , randomize control trial include addition control group cost time save comparison . As pilot study , eligible patient evaluate treat ED physician rank potential diagnosis least likely . A study investigator perform B-RIPPED scan provide initial treat physician result . The treat physician ask complete differential diagnosis rank know B-RIPPED result . Changes differential diagnosis ranking , physician order , intervention compile . A randomized control cohort assign eligible patient . In control group , treat physician complete diagnosis rank list prior completion workup , lab value back . Time disposition , comparison labs radiology test order compare cohort receive BRIPPED scan . Patients assign number time enrollment , randomly assign control experimental ( patient receive BRIPPED scan ) group . Packets contain appropriate data collection form ( control experimental ) organize even numbered patient belong one group , odd numbered patient assign .</detailed_description>
