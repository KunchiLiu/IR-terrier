	<brief_summary>Pain discomfort anterior cervical spine surgery difficult quantify quote moderate severity , often need oral opioid analgesic . In addition , patient prone postoperative respiratory complication due airway edema secondary surgical retraction wound hematoma . Opioid analgesic provide good pain control postoperative nausea vomit respiratory depression undesirable patient risk postoperative wound hematoma airway edema The use multimodal analgesia rapidly become 'standard care ' prevent pain ambulatory procedure surgery center throughout world . The purpose study determine whether superficial cervical plexus block improve postoperative quality recovery measure Quality Recovery 40 questionnaire ( QoR-40 ) patient undergo elective anterior cervical discectomy fusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anterior cervical discectomy fusion increasingly do day surgery short stay surgery . Postoperative pain lead cause unplanned hospital admission follow day surgery , major source dissatisfaction often impair quality recovery . Opioid analgesic alone always effective may also worsen postoperative nausea vomit turn postoperative recovery . This study design find injection freeze side neck around nerve ( superficial cervical plexus block ) improve quality recovery anesthesia surgery reduce pain , analgesic consumption anterior cervical spine surgery . Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure global QoR-40 aggregate score 24 hour surgery . Secondary Outcome Measures - Postoperative pain score ( first 24 hour ) - Total analgesic consumption ( first 24 hour ) - Time first opioid administration - Postop Nausea vomiting ( first 24 hour ) - Post operative sedation ( first 24 hour )</detailed_description>
