	<brief_title>A Study Compare Bioavailability JNJ-47910382 Formulated Tablet Suspension Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , 2-way crossover study ( method use switch participant one treatment arm another clinical study ) compare oral bioavailability JNJ-47910382 formulate uncoated tablet suspension , healthy participant . The study consist 3 phase , include , screen phase , open-label treatment phase , follow phase . The screening phase within 21 day administration first dose study medication . After screen , participant randomize accord classical 2 sequence ( ie , treatment sequence AB [ participant first receive treatment A treatment B ] sequence BA [ participant first receive treatment B treatment A ] ) , 2-period crossover design receive study medication treatment phase . In session ( Session 1 Session 2 ) , participant receive either Treatment A : 200 mg dose JNJ-47910382 formulate suspension , Treatment B : 200 mg JNJ-47910382 formulate uncoated tablet . There washout period ( period participant receive study medication ) least 7 14 day 2 session . The follow phase include 2 follow visit intake study medication last treatment session . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , vital sign , physical examination , specific toxicity monitor throughout study . The duration study least 11 18 day ( screen follow phase include ) .</detailed_description>
