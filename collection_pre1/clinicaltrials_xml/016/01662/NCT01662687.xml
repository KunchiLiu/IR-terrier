	<brief_summary>Multicenter , randomize , open-label , paralled-group , active-controlled study . The study demonstrate non-inferiority Granisetron Transdermal Delivery System ( GTDS ) compare intravenous oral Granisetron prevention CINV associate moderately emetogenic Chemotherapy . Patients schedule receive one cycle ME chemotherapy regimen administer 1-4 day attend Screening Visit 2 28 day start ME chemotherapy . Eligible patient randomize 1 2 treatment group Randomization Visit ( 1 2 day prior ME chemotherapy ) . - Sancuso patch - Kytril inj.+Kytril tab . The patch apply 2days ( 48-24h ) prior first daily dose moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimen remain place 6 day . The patient assess daily 4days first chemotherapy administration . Adverse Events ( AEs ) collect 14 day final dose IP . Non-serious AEs followed-up 14 day final dose IP . Serious adverse event followed-up resolve , stable patient lose follow-up .</brief_summary>
