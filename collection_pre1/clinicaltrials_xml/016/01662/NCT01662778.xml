	<brief_title>The Clinical Effect Monodisperse Fluticasone Propionate Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhaled drug therapy establish effective mean treat lung disease asthma . Medical inhaler ( 'puffers ' ) form cornerstone management patient respiratory/lung problem . Inhaled treatment usually comprise place inhaler ( puffer ) mouth inhale measure dose drug puffer . The drug dose need bypass throat reach lung , order effective . However , still much know actually happen inhaled drug lung . Much inhaled drug dose puffer fail reach lung hit back throat . Only small amount ( approximately little 20 % ) drug reach important part lung beneficial effect . Particle size significant influence ability get inhale drug important part lung . In order get inhale drug important part lung necessary understand much clinical improvement obtain identical dos FP inhale different particle size . Inhalers ( bit like hairspray can air fresher can ) produce aerosol cloud particle . Medical inhaler come different shape size variety drug use treat patient . Inhalers use routine clinical practice produce 'coarse ' mist drug particle , potential side effect , different size particle deposit different part respiratory tract include ; mouth , throat , windpipe , bloodstream ( place want inhaled drug 'deposit ' ) lung ( want drug go ) . This particularly important consideration inhale steroid commonly use management patient asthma bronchitis emphysema . For example , common side effect deposition steroid drug throat lead hoarse altered voice , sometimes thrush throat . In contrast , monodisperse aerosol special 'fine−mist ' aerosol , drug particle one particle size . We use aerosols investigate science way lung handle respond inhaled drug different particle size . We shall use small large drug particle . In order deliver inhale drug monodisperse aerosol , shall use spin top aerosol generator ( STAG ) ( large research nebuliser machine ) able selectively generate aerosol cloud fine mist . This efficient machine compare current nebuliser use routine clinical practice , often difficult control inhale drug dose patient ; sometimes patient get little dose nebuliser inefficient inhaler device . But , also , improve efficiency inhale drug delivery − allow low drug dos use − decrease potential patient side effect . We previously undertaken publish medical literature series clinical study patient asthma use STAG 'fine−mist ' aerosol system 'reliever ' drug salbutamol ( ventolin ) . Also , currently undertake investigation pharmacokinetic effect inhale 'preventer ' steroid class drug FP different particle size . The main question improve beneficial effect inhale drug lung alter particle size . This study form next step investigation commonly use inhaled steroid Fluticasone Propionate , use asthma , bronchitis emphysema patient . We hope investigation help provide answer rationale improving efficiency drug delivery ( change drug particle size ) one may improve inhaled drug delivery improve clinical benefit .</detailed_description>
