	<brief_summary>Assess relative change thrombus volume determine two assessment ( Baseline Day 14-21 ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) subject deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) treat either edoxaban monotherapy regimen low molecular weight ( LMW ) heparin/warfarin regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-Label , Parallel-Group , Multi-Center Study Evaluation Efficacy Safety Edoxaban Monotherapy Versus Low Molecular Weight ( LMW ) Heparin/Warfarin Subjects With Symptomatic Deep-Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The classical management patient venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) consist initial treatment least five day ( LMW ) heparin follow long-term treatment vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) , warfarin . The eTRIS study address clinically important question whether edoxaban monotherapy , without concomitant ( LMW ) heparin time treatment initiation comparable well standard treatment ( LMW ) heparin/warfarin therapy subject acute symptomatic DVT assess relative change baseline thrombus volume ( measured MRI ) Day 14-21 .</detailed_description>
