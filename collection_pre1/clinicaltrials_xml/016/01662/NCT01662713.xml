	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find non-invasive imaging device call Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) help doctor see tissue blood vessel relate non-melanoma skin cancer . OFDI design see microscopic detail skin without need use invasive technique surgery biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Frequency Domain Imaging Non-melanoma Skin Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) common cancer United States , 750,000 diagnose patient treat every year . Its prevalence incidence significantly increase past two decade estimate 20 % Americans develop type cancer lifetime ( Neville et al. , 2007 ) . Biopsy surgical resection NMSC result tissue mutilation scar . Therefore , need new image technology use non-invasively guide biopsy surgery . Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) second-generation image implementation optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) develop Wellman Center . OFDI provide high-resolution three-dimensional imaging tissue . It use interferometric depth-sectioning technique employ near-infrared light source . Through analysis phase information record signal . OFDI detect blood vessel within tissue tumor . Importantly , OFDI-based vascular imaging perform without need exogenous contrast agent , make relatively easy deploy clinical setting .</detailed_description>
