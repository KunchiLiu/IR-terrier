	<detailed_description>The primary objective collect data use OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System ( Apollo Endosurgery , Inc. Austin , Texas ) gastric tissue approximation primary gastric restrictive procedure . The primary endpoint study evaluation safety feasibility procedure . All subject plication procedure initiate ( defined placement overtube ) include safety analysis . The primary safety analysis assess occurrence adverse event 12 month plication procedure . Technical success define minimum placement 8 suture upon initial endoscopic intervention . Safety determine adverse event directly relate procedure 12 month . Secondary Endpoints : 1 . Efficacy : Data follow effectiveness outcome measure ( variable ) collect analyzed relative baseline : - Percent excess weight loss ( % EWL ) - Total weight lose ( kg ) percent weight lose - Change ( BMI ) percent change BMI - Change waist circumference - Improvement co‐morbid disease ( ) include , limited , improvement vital sign and/or laboratory value - Changes quality life measure report Quality Life questionnaire ( ) ( evaluate relative baseline ) - Changes feeling satiety measure report TFEQ‐R18 ( relative baseline ) 2 . Durability : Data collect durability plication evaluate remain plication 12 month endoscopy , compare number plication place time procedure .</detailed_description>
