	<brief_summary>Anesthetizing nerve extremity effective way freeze area preparation surgery . The doctor inject local anesthetic appropriate area , interrupt signal nerve area control movement sensation . Depending much anesthetic inject , doctor impair movement sensation sensation alone . Currently , method use determine much sensation patient area , test patient 's response pinprick cold sensation skin . Unfortunately , method subjective n't always give accurate measurement extensive block . For reason , accurate objective method assess nerve block need . We wish perform study test two nerve stimulation device compare ability give adequate measurement nerve activity local anesthesia . If find common nerve stimulator consistently give accurate reading nerve activity , anesthesiologist may able use device determine well nerve block work adjust patient 's anesthesia accordingly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale Peripheral nerve block ( PNBs ) highly effective method anesthetize region body surgery . Throughout history , field regional anesthesiology lack objective , quantitative tool assess effectiveness give block . Current method assess block mainly subjective rely patient feedback determine well nerve block ; method include 1 ) sensory test , ability detect pinprick cold sensation , 2 ) motor test , example , ability flex extend body part block , 3 ) verbal feedback patient . Although method usually provide satisfactory assessment block , objective tool could decisively consistently determine well nerve block would avoid ambiguity inherent subjective test may allow anesthesiologist precisely control pain surgery . Nerve stimulation technology represent one possible method objectively assess PNBs elicit paresthesia region body undergo blockade . Nerve stimulation device operate send electrical current nerve , depolarize , elicit muscle contraction paresthesia , depend type nerve stimulate ( motor sensory , respectively ) . In theory , patient may exhibit high current perception threshold region body anesthetize . Several nerve stimulation device commercially available , although vary cost , setup , feature . The Neurometer diagnostic stimulator percutaneous nerve stimulation device record sensory nerve conduction threshold commonly use diagnose neuropathy associate condition carpal tunnel syndrome , diabetes , spinal cord lesion . The Neurometer generate constant alternate current sinusoid waveform stimuli three different calibrate frequency : 2000 Hz , 250 Hz , 5 Hz range stimulus output intensity 0.01 9.99 milliAmperes ( mA ) . The current delivered skin surface via pair 1 cm diameter gold electrode separate 1.7 cm . Other device , peripheral nerve stimulators , commonly connect insulated needle stimulate catheter locate nerve block . When connected surface electrode probe , peripheral nerve stimulator delivers electric current elicits motor sensory activity current stimulates appropriate target nerve . The device generates square pulse selectable stimulus duration continuously adjustable stimulation current . The pulse current adjust appropriate level , allow extremely precise adjustment stimulation current . The stimulation frequency stimulus duration varied different application . The nerve stimulator feature option select frequency 1 Hz 2 Hz sequential electrical nerve stimulation stimulus duration 0.05 millisecond ( m ) 1 m . Although Neurometer represent gold standard percutaneous nerve stimulation , expensive , make impractical use everyday clinical application . We hypothesize common peripheral nerve stimulator device use functional substitute Neurometer generate sensory stimulus ass PNB effectiveness . The aim study compare Neurometer common nerve stimulator assess anesthesia follow PNB . We predict nerve stimulator use successfully substitute Neurometer assess PNBs patient receive regional anesthesia extremity . Study objective To compare Neurometer common peripheral nerve stimulator measure current perception threshold patient receive PNB . Hypothesis A nerve stimulator use place Neurometer generate sensory stimulus reliably accurately assess extent PNB . Study procedures This study recruit patient schedule elective surgery University Alberta Hospital ( UAH ) . Since observational study , sample size 60 participant choose convenience . Each week UAH , numerous outpatient surgery perform abdomen upper low extremity , allow data collect span several month . Potential participant recruit member study team either Same-Day Admitting Ward hold area adjacent nerve block area operating theatre . Signed consent obtain participant ; participation voluntary patient right withdraw study point . Prior nerve block , member study team record nerve responses various area patient 's extremity ( hand , foot ) appropriate sensory area use Neurometer nerve stimulator ( Stimuplex HNS 12 , B.Braun , Germany ) . Common nerve block surgery upper extremity include interscalene , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , low extremity surgery commonly entail spinal ankle block popliteal block sciatic nerve . Epidural block commonly use abdominal surgery . The Neurometer current perception threshold ( CPT ) test administer standardize cutaneous test site specific dermatomal peripheral nerve evaluation . The standardized CPT exam include prepare test site supply prep paste test subject body site three frequency follow order : 2000 Hz , 250 Hz 5 Hz . A pair gold electrode coat thin layer conductive gel tap cutaneous site test . Next , intensity alignment procedure conduct approximate sensory threshold within 10 mA range . Then , use automate double-blind ( micro-processor control ) methodology , subject present 7-10 cycle randomly select real false stimulus , perception threshold level , exact CPT value within range determine . This test methodology able determine reproducible CPT measure within +/-10 mA range . The nerve stimulator test involve connect ground electrode surface electrode probe ( Pajunk , Germany ) nerve stimulator . The ground electrode secure body current deliver touch tip probe point body test Neurometer . A small amount conduct gel apply area test apply tip probe skin . A stimulation frequency 2 Hz use current gradually increase 0.0 mA patient detect 'tingling ' feeling area . The study team also assess block use cold sensation test , cold stimulus ( rubber glove contain ice ) apply skin patient ask give feedback perception cold stimulus ( see ) . After pre-block data record , patient receive ultrasound-guided PNB appropriate type surgery perform standard fashion . After block perform , patient ' nerve response block region assess two nerve stimulation device standard cold stimulus test appropriate interval ( e.g. , 10 , 20 , 30 minute ) patient ready surgery . For electrical stimulus test , current require elicit sensation block region different stimulation frequency ( 2 Hz nerve stimulator 2000 Hz , 250 Hz , 5 Hz Neurometer ) record . For cold stimulus test , scale measure sensation use ( 3 = full sensation ; 2 = reduce sensation still cold ; 1 = sensation , cold ; 0 = sensation ) . The block deem complete current readout electrical device reach 10 mA cold sensation 1 less ; point , patient transfer surgical suite . Following surgery , patient ' nerve response block region assess two device cold stimulus test post-anesthesia recovery room . Data record hand data collection sheet transfer MS Excel database follow study . Nerve response data obtain Neurometer nerve stimulator compare determine nerve stimulator able reproduce satisfactory extent nerve stimulation reading Neurometer . These result also compare result cold stimulus test detect correlation patient 's nerve response data able detect cold stimulus .</detailed_description>
