	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis common cold weather seasonal respiratory illness affect infant child . Multiple supportive therapy try infant bronchiolitis include albuterol , racemic epinephrine , hypertonic saline nebulization , date supportive therapy oxygen proven therapy decrease respiratory distress infant bronchiolitis , hypertonic saline show borderline statistically significant improvement . This prospective , randomize study compare CSS PEWS score infant receive oxygen standard flow nasal cannula receive oxygen via Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula ( HHFNC ) . The result help determine infant viral bronchiolitis receive humidify high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy improve Clinical Severity Score ( CSS ) Pediatric Early Warning System ( PEWS ) score ultimately decreased length admission compare patient treat nasal cannula oxygen therapy with/without bronchodilator therapy . Hypothesis Heated Humidified High-flow Nasal Cannula Delivery Oxygen decrease respiratory distress measure pediatric CSS PEWS compare routine nasal cannula oxygen delivery infant bronchiolitis .</brief_summary>
