This , turn , allow target antimicrobial agent selection patient community acquired-pneumonia ( CAP ) . Hypothesis : 1 ) To determine Targeted strategy non-inferior Empiric therapy respect outcome endpoint . 2 ) To assess use innovative POC test allows target narrow-spectrum antimicrobial therapy . 3 ) To determine Targeted strategy superior Empiric therapy patient viral pneumonia</brief_summary>
