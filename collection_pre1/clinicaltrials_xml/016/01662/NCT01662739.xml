	<detailed_description>Background : Gastric cancer ( GC ) 5th common cancer 3rd lead cause cancer-related death worldwide . GC incidence mortality rate vary widely across different geographical area . In Italy province Cremona characterize high incidence , compare national one . For reason specialize population base registry set . Methods : Up collection encompasses GC case diagnose Cremona province January 1st 2010 December 31st 2015 . The main data source represent pathological record patient clinical chart . Data collect follow AIRTum ( Associazione Italiana Registri Tumori ) IARC ( International Agency Research Cancer ) cancer registration recommendation . Territory Cremona province comprise 3 main public hospital 3 private structure . All refer 2 pathology service . All facility involve project . A minority patient usually ask different surgery move neighboring province , mainly Milan Brescia . An official collaboration facility sign order access data patient inhabitant province Cremona . A multidisciplinary team clinician ( oncologist , gastroenterologist , general practitioner , surgeon ) , pathologist , geneticist methodologists ( epidemiologist , hygienist ) involve project . The registration incident case usually begin pathological confirmation diagnosis cancer . Subsequently , medical record obtain . For case follow variable register : personal familiar data ; image study perform ; detail surgery treatment receive ; host genetic background biomolecular characteristic , social environmental factor . All data collect , record , protect processed accordance AIRTum-IARC ( International Agency Research Cancer ) cancer registration recommendation national privacy law . Any age diagnosis include . At time diagnosis patient inhabitant province Cremona ( district Crema , Cremona Casalmaggiore ) . Only diagnose primary gastric neoplasm consider . Precancerous lesion relapse tumor diagnosis consider . For specific purpose study , n't record case diagnose base Death Certificate Only ( DCO ) '' situ '' tumor also include . Site tumor diagnosis stomach gastro-esophageal junction ( GEJ ) , ref . cod . ICD-X C16 , accord UICC , 7th ed . All gastric malignancy consider : gastric cancer ; lymphoma ; sarcoma GIST . Gastric cancer classify accord Lauren 's classification system , distinguish two main histological type : `` intestinal '' `` diffuse '' . `` Mixed '' gastric carcinoma compose intestinal diffuse component also identify . The primary tumor location divide three group consideration oncological also surgical approach . Such group 1 ) GEJ-cardia ; 2 ) body-fundus ; 3 ) antrum-pylorus-angulus . The TNM classification record corresponding pathological stage determine accord 7th edition Union International Cancer Control ( UICC ) hereditary case accord International GC Linkage Consortium guideline . Evaluation infection Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) perform immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) health gastric mucosa use GIEMSA stain method . The HER-2 oncogene overexpression evaluate tumour gastric mucosa IHC method Dako Hercept TestTM . Results confirm Fluorescent Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) IHC positivity score 2 . To individuate Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer ( HDGC ) case , criteria International GC Linkage Consortium 2010 guideline follow . Incidence , standard error , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate accord International Agency Research Cancer ( IARC ) general guideline . As CIs , method consider approximation Poisson distribution chosen . Age-specific incidence rate stratify 18 subgroup 5-year age interval ( 0 - 4 , 85+ year ) . Raw age-specific ( 5-years class ) age-standardised ( age-adjusted ) rate calculate per 100,000 inhabitant . For raw rate denominator resident population census 31st December year , available online official site Cremona province . An age-standardized rate ( ASR ) weight average age-specific ( raw ) rate , weight proportion individual correspond age group standard population . Age-standardised rate calculate use standard age-structure European ( EU ) World ( W ) standard population . This correct potential confound effect derive difference age different population . The trend incidence , express `` Annual Percent Change '' ( APC ) evaluate use Join Point ( National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) order identify significant change . Overall survival analysis carry Kaplan-Meier method statistically significant difference evaluate Log-Rank Test . Survival hazard ratio evaluate Cox regression model , subsequently test proportion hazard . Cumulative risk variable , include age diagnosis , anatomical subsite , morphology tumour , TNM stage diagnosis , presence HP infection , HER-2 amplification status , 5-year survival 1-year mortality rate report . Descriptive statistic use summarize data parametric non-parametric test use evaluate difference group . Statistical analysis carry STATA 13 software package ( Texas , USA ) . A p-value le 0.05 va consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENTS ELEGIBILY : Any patient age GC cancer diagnosis include . Male female patient either include . Healthy volunteer include . At time diagnosis cancer patient must province Cremona inhabitant ( district Crema , Cremona Casalmaggiore ) . Informed consent signature require . TUMOR ELEGIBLY : Diagnosis must perform 2010 Juanuary , 1st 2013 December , 31st .The diagnosis must infiltrate malignant tumor . The diagnosis primary tumor . Precancerous diagnosis consider . Recidivate tumor consider . The site localization tumor diagnosis must stomach gastro esophageal junction site tumor onset . HDGC ELEGIBILY : Gastric cancer know manifestation inherit cancer predisposition syndromes similar hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer LiFraumeni syndrome . According OMIM database , 90 per cent gastric cancer sporadic , whereas less 10 per cent hereditary ( HDGC ) . Germline Ecadherin inactivate mutation CDH1 gene responsible development GC approximately 30 % family hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome ( HDGC ) . Diagnostic criterion HDGC formulate International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999 review 2010 . In order individuate HDGC case include specialist counsel CDH1 gene mutation evaluation , criteria International GC Linkage Consortium 2010 guideline follow .</criteria>
