	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine whether first ( sentinel ) lymph nodes drainage pathway colonic tumour detect time surgery use new technique . The detection method inject fluorescent dye ( indocyanine green ) adjacent tumour . The dye see fluoresces light form near infrared spectrum use time laparoscopic ( keyhole ) surgery . An endoscope place colon ( colonoscopy ) surgery tracer fluorescent agent inject around tumour . The mesentery lymph node drain tumour locate examine laparoscopy expect fluorescence identify within approximately 5 minute injection . The first lymph node node take fluorescent dye mark place clip stitch . After surgery complete colon remove lymph node examine microscopically pathologist , pay particular attention whether tumour cell present sentinel lymph node whether presence absence tumour cell node accurately reflect tumour status rest specimen . If pilot demonstrate sentinel lymph node reliably detect , develop technique allow u remove small area ( le 5 cm ) colon . Using procedure decrease complication follow traditional surgery . We however also need method allows accurate assessment lymph node drain tumour . This pilot trial examine ability detect 'sentinel ' lymph node use status ( positive cancer cell negative ) determine whether small operation full thickness localise excision adequate treatment patient avoid large operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common cancer second high cause cancer death UK . Introduction National Bowel Cancer Screening Program increase awareness symptom colorectal cancer lead increase number cancer detect early stage disease . Standard surgical management , however , remain unchanged segmental colectomy en bloc mesenteric resection regional lymph node metastatic status node remain important factor determine adjuvant treatment . This course appropriate majority patient diagnose colorectal cancer present symptomatic , locally advanced disease . Our practice , however , need reconsider view recently publish data screening centre . Pilot result demonstrate significant shift towards earlier stage disease screen population suggests , future , 50 % screen detected-cancers T1 T2 ( i.e . early stage disease ) 1 . Less 15 % patient T1 T2 disease nodal involvement 2 current radiological technique sensitive enough identify patient pre-operatively . Instead , major surgery perform patient T1 T2 stage colonic cancer , 85 % , en bloc mesenteric resection provide therapeutic benefit , node negative disease . Major resection also expose patient significant risk morbidity mortality , along late side effect . The concept sentinel lymph node mapping ( SLNM ) colorectal cancer new although impact clinical care breast cancer , melanoma , recently gastric cancer 3-6 , expert centre suggest may clinically relevant 7 , 8 . The technique base principle first possible site metastasis along lymphatic drainage route primary lesion know sentinel lymph node ( SLNs ) detect use injection dye , radioisotope combination . Therefore , evaluation SLNs result accurate assessment nodal status entire lymphatic basin allow tailored surgical treatment . Although technique transform surgical care melanoma breast cancer patient , application patient colorectal cancer question due discrepancy report result cause heterogeneous study design employ , variation surgical experience differ patient inclusion criterion 9-11 . Detailed analysis study perform date show tumour patient characterisation well surgeon experience key factor assess utility technique 2 , 12 least three node need find order maximise 13 . The main research focus far optimise technique . Initial research perform use blue dye , radioactive colloid combination fail achieve 95-97 % identification rate find breast cancer also accompany unacceptable false negative rate 14-17 . Although many author note false negative occur predominantly patient advanced disease ( T3 T4 cancer ) 18-20 , utilisation identification agent proven frustrate date . Radioactive colloid require involvement nuclear medicine physician , difficult localise handheld camera cause signal interference SLN ( ) close injection site . Blue dye however difficult localise patient high body mass index ( BMI ) , unfortunately comprise majority patient population , thus produce limited ( ) visualisation afferent lymphatic vessel SLN ( ) . In order re-examine extensive research report SLNM , secondary intention analysis two large multicentre SLN databases undertaken . This report 225 patient T1 T2 disease , accurate detection SLNs possible 95 % , confirm stag technique accurate patient early colonic cancer 2 . This improved operator experience tumour size small 35 mm diameter . In 196 patient treat experienced surgeon , 144 ( 73.4 % ) , would correctly undergo localised full thickness resection surgery base SLNs status 49 ( 25.0 % ) , would require conventional resection either SLNs identify , due detection metastasis . Only 3 patient ( 1.5 % ) would inappropriately predicted node negative . To overcome aforementioned issue , number researcher utilized optical image use near-infrared ( NIR ) fluorescence lymphatic tracer indocyanine green ( ICG ) enable real-time intraoperative visualisation lymphatic channel SLNs . The technique performs well combination radioactive tracer blue dye patient breast cancer 21 , also validate patient early gastric cancer 4-6 . ICG initially recommend tattoo agent colonic pancreatic lesion aid perioperative localization 22-24 , report complication focal peritonitis , abscess formation , postoperative adhesion ileus see use India ink 25-27 . However , use tattoo agent limit patient undergo surgery within 8 day endoscopic injection , dye dissipates lymphatic channel due small molecular size 22 . More recently , fluorescence property utilise intraoperative localisation colorectal neoplasms associate SLNs 28-32 patient undergo surgery use either charge-coupled device ( CCD ) NIR camera . Nagata et al . demonstrate observation ICG dye use NIR camera far superior conventional laparoscopy identification SLNs five time well 29 . These result suggest SLNM technique use NIR fluorescent tracer may useful patient high BMI large amount mesenteric adipose tissue . All author report NIR technique note success colorectal practice , without adverse effect comparable role use early breast gastric cancer . The ability utilise technique confidently identify SLNs potential transform surgical care patient colonic neoplasia . The focus , however , must patient early disease , thus allow node negative disease consider localised full thickness resection primary cancer definitive surgical therapy . Unfortunately , study publish date include patient T3 disease series 29 , 31 . This pilot trial aim apply well-described technique use NIR camera ICG tracer order clarify whether SLNs confidently identify patient undergoing conventional resection ( segmental colectomy en bloc mesenteric resection ) T1 T2 colonic cancer . This protocol base extensive literature search study describe technique patient early gastric colorectal cancer 5 , 6 , 29-31 , 33-36 . Provided pilot trial successful , order obtain adequate power , large multicentre trial require determine whether node visualise NIR map representative patient 's lymphatic basin metastatic status . Proven concordance pathology SLNs standard nodal resection would justify limited surgical intervention , take SLN ( ) , allow precisely tailor operative intervention . All patient pilot trial undergo standard surgical treatment addition NIR SLNM technique .</detailed_description>
