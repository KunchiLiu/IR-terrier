	<brief_summary>There increase asthma allergic disease prevalence , especially child . Given high prevalence , associate high disease burden cost , urgent need identify effective strategy primary prevention asthma allergy . A systematic review literature find strong supportive epidemiological evidence protective role Mediterranean Diet ( MD ) . The investigator aim undertake pilot trial sample pregnant woman establish recruitment , retention , measurable change dietary intervention encourage great adherence MD pregnancy , acceptability dietary advice diet modification . This pilot study 2-arm randomise control trial ( RCT ) sample population around 50 Scottish pregnant woman . This work ultimately aim contribute improve health outcome seek reduce incidence asthma allergic problem . This pilot trial prove invaluable informing subsequent plan definitive parallel group RCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Mediterranean Diet Intervention Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims The primary aim pilot trial investigate rate maternal recruitment retention , adherence MD latter two trimester pregnancy ( i.e . week 12 36 ) . The secondary aim determine whether subsequent measurable change Mediterranean Diet score whether dietary advice diet modification acceptable . Research question 1 . What recruitment retention rate pregnant mother whose infant high risk atopic disease ? 2 . Is advice dietary modification acceptable participant ? 3 . To extent mother able adhere MD ? 4 . Can MD score increased pregnancy ? 5 . Can measurable change biomarker oxidative stress detect result adherence MD ? 6 . Can increase MD sustained pregnancy ? Design 1 . Trial design This two-arm pilot RCT . Trial participant recruit 2-3 hospitals/community treatment centre Scotland . 2 . Participant recruitment Pregnant woman age 16 year send letter invitation , information participant , consent form trial date scan appointment hospital . Interested participant invite contact researcher text , phone email discus project answer question may ; screen eligibility take part trial . Eligibility high risk woman define : one first degree blood relative atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , food allergy , allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) asthma , use question 'Do , mother , father sibling baby allergic disease : eczema , food allergy , hay fever asthma ? ' Responses record screen questionnaire . The researcher send participant food frequency questionnaire completion home urine container instruction fill container day scan bring , Consent form complete FFQ along hand researcher . The urine specimen use analysis marker oxidative stress , antioxidant activity nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis . The researcher greet participant wait area clinic prior date scan consent form , urine sample FFQ collect . After scan , consent eligible participant complete baseline MD questionnaire . 3 . Intervention The intervention 15 minute dietary advice session direct increase MD score , subsequent telephone support session throughout pregnancy . Intervention arm Mothers randomise intervention arm meet project researcher visit hospital first date scan . After scan , participant receive 15 minute dietary advice session , encourage consumption particular food consistent MD , key message supplement written/visual material , regular supportive telephone call . No energy restriction suggest . A £10 supermarket voucher give participant . The first follow-up researcher telephone 12 week post-baseline MD questionnaire inform receive second MD questionnaire reply envelope completion return . A supermarket voucher value £10 send participant receipt complete form . Two week prior 24 week post-baseline MD questionnaire project researcher contact participant phone arrange home visit . When visit home researcher , third MD questionnaire second FFQ complete hand researcher urine sample obtain . Free continuous telephone access researcher available throughout study . Control arm Mothers randomise control arm meet project researcher visit hospital first date scan . The participant receive 15 minute dietary advice session . A £10 supermarket voucher give participant . The first follow-up researcher telephone 12 week post-baseline MD questionnaire inform receive second MD questionnaire reply envelope completion return . A supermarket voucher value £10 send participant receipt complete form . Two week prior 24 week post-baseline MD questionnaire project researcher contact participant phone arrange home visit . When visit home researcher , third MD questionnaire second FFQ complete hand researcher urine sample obtain . 4 . Randomisation Allocation intervention control arm via pre-randomised sealed envelope , base predetermined random number allocation , restrict recruitment site . This restricted randomisation carry independent statistician . 5 . Follow-up Participants enrol total ~7 month ( i.e . 12-36 week pregnancy ) . Outcome measure - Recruitment rate ( i.e . proportion invite take part compare number consent woman ) - Retention rate ( i.e . proportion start study finish ) - Change MD score baseline 24 36 week pregnancy - Change oxidative stress whole-body NO production - Acceptability dietary advice diet modification</detailed_description>
