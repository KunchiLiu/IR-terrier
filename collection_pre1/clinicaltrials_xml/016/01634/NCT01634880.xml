	<brief_summary>Standard therapy high-risk locally advanced salivary gland malignancy surgery follow postoperative radiation therapy . Studies show superiority combine modality therapy compare surgery alone . Despite addition postoperative radiation therapy , five-year survival locally advance salivary gland malignancy poor ( less 60 % ) . In salivary gland malignancy , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) express 25-85 % ; certain histological type , like salivary duct carcinoma , expression high . EGFR promise target anticancer therapy . In squamous cell carcinoma head neck , phase III trial utilize cetuximab add radiation therapy improve locoregional control overall survival compare radiation alone . Panitumumab novel , human , IgG2 EGFR monoclonal antibody may better tolerate efficacious cetuximab . Here , investigator hypothesize addition panitumumab standard radiotherapy locally advance salivary gland malignancy improve recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims To determine recurrence-free survival ( primary endpoint ) , overall survival , local distant recurrence-free survival , treatment-related toxicity . Also , investigator plan study EGFR-related immune biomarkers baseline tumor tissue well blood sample obtain prior therapy . Subject Population We enroll patient completely resect , locally advanced salivary gland cancer . Treatment Plan Standard radiation 64-70Gy 2.0 Gy daily fraction 6-7 week . Panitumumab 2.5 mg/Kg IV , weekly radiation ( total 6-7 dos ) . Statistical Design Sample Size Phase II , one-stage , study 3-year recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) primary endpoint . The sample size 30 patient .</detailed_description>
