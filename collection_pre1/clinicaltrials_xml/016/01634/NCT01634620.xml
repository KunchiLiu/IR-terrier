	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Overview : The measurement exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) clinical test measure airway inflammation perform consistently accurately clinical practice point-of-care . Airway inflammation recognize central mechanism pathogenesis asthma symptom . The measurement FeNO NIOX MINO® device provide rapid , noninvasive , inexpensive tool ass airway inflammation inflammatory airway diseases asthma . The test easy perform require minimal training operator conduct test . Burden Disease : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) heterogeneous group diseases characterize chronic airflow obstruction interfere normal breathing . The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report year 2005 , approximately one 20 death United States COPD underlie cause . Role Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) : FeNO evolve predictive prognostic biomarker airway inflammation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas produce epithelial cell bronchial wall intrinsic part inflammatory process . COPD coexist asthma . However , exact role FeNO patient establish COPD remains define . While COPD airway inflammation usually associate increase neutrophil , patient COPD may feature asthma mixed inflammatory pattern increase eosinophil . However , many patient difficulty expectorate sputum and/or produce poor quality sputum sample adequate accurately quantify eosinophilic cell . Since FeNO measure easily reliably , may useful evaluate airway inflammation COPD thus predict steroid responsiveness COPD . Intended Use : NIOX MINO® measure Nitric Oxide ( NO ) human breath . Nitric Oxide frequently increase inflammatory process asthma . The fractional NO concentration expire breath ( FeNO ) measure NIOX MINO® assurance measurement repeatable accord guideline NO measurement establish American Thoracic Society . Rationale Study : While number preliminary study FeNO COPD , literature define role FeNO patient establish COPD minimal . The purpose current study , therefore characterize FeNO level may indicative eosinophilic airway inflammation patient chronic obstructive airway disease . This data may useful determine whether FeNO predict improvement FEV1 follow ICS treatment CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES To characterize FeNO level may indicative eosinophilic airway inflammation patient chronic obstructive airway disease . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN This pilot , observational , multi-center , single-visit , outpatient study . Subjects meet Inclusion Criteria none Exclusion Criteria , express interest study participation , ask provide follow documentation information : - Informed Consent - Demographics - Baseline Characteristics - FeNO : - Subjects receive train study staff use NIOX MINO® device perform FeNO Measurements - Spirometry - Severity COPD Subject discharge study : Once information collect procedure perform , subject discharge clinic study participation complete Selection investigation population : Male female subject , age 40 year , inclusive , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) include chronic bronchitis emphysema and/or mixed diagnosis asthma/COPD recruit . A subject withdrawn clinical investigation , opinion Investigator , medically necessary , express wish subject . Medical device : The NIOX MINO® initially clear FDA March 4 , 2008 new hand-held device measurement exhale Nitric Oxide , marker eosinophilic airway inflammation . The recent clearance FDA September 2 , 2010 Instrument ( 09-1100 ) , use study . NIOX MINO® use child 7-17 year age adults 18 year age older initial assessment management asthma . The NIOX MINO® 10 second test base exhale breath measure 50 ml/second flow rate . Results provide point care within 2 minute successful completion breath test . The test influence patient effort variation clinician 's test technique . Definitions : Adverse event : Any incident use medical device ( include vitro diagnostics ) suspect resulted adverse outcome patient . Serious Injury mean injury illness : - Is life-threatening - Results permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure , - Necessitates medical surgical intervention preclude permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure . Malfunction : failure device meet performance specification otherwise perform intend . Caused contribute : death serous injury may attribute medical device , medical device may factor death serious injury , include event occur result : - Failure - Malfunction - Improper inadequate design - Manufacture - Labeling - User error</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) include chronic bronchitis emphysema , and/or mixed diagnosis asthma/COPD . Concurrent Conditions Disease : Subjects chronic obstructive lung disease include limited cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , bronchiectasis , obliterative bronchiolitis , ciliary dyskinesia , postviral bronchial hyperresponsive syndrome , vocal cord dysfunction , rhinosinusitis , noneosinophilic asthma , reactive airway dysfunction syndrome exclude . In addition , subject pneumothorax , fracture rib ( ) , sign cardiac instability include limited recent myocardial infarction , unstable angina , unstable vital sign , acute shortness breath , chest tightness chest pain exclude . Study Participation Outside This Protocol : Subjects currently enrol study Investigational nonInvestigational Drugs Medical Devices and/or participated study within 30 day prior study exclude .</criteria>
