	<brief_summary>Obesity major problem worldwide current dietary intervention prove enough cease increase level obesity detrimental side effect , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Existing data suggest adjustment macronutrient composition diet , specifically protein content , may beneficial effect body composition antiobesegenic effect appetite . This may important term control body weight reduce amount fatty tissue within body organ , therefore prevent obesity health related side effect . The investigator perform study investigate whether high protein low energy diet compare normal protein low energy diet , overweight adult modify appetite aid loss weight fat mass . Subjects receive either high protein low energy diet ( 1.34g protein/kg body weight ) normal protein low energy diet ( 0.8g protein/kg body weight ) form 2 meal replacement one conventional meal per day 2 snack 12 week . HYPOTHESIS In overweight subject metabolic syndrome , 12 week dietary intervention high protein low energy diet lead reduce appetite , body weight fat mass , specifically great fall level fat liver pancreas low energy normal protein diet .</brief_summary>
