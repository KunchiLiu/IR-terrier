	<criteria>Biopsyproven invasive adenocarcinoma rectum , stage T34 and/or nodepositive ( AJCC stage II III ) . For purpose study , tumor locate `` rectum '' distal edge locate within 12cm anal verge . The distal edge tumor delineate digital examination endoscopic examination , include colonoscopy , although rigid proctoscopy prefer . Age &gt; 18 year . Performance status 0 1 ECOG scale require ( See Appendix 1 ) . Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcl total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal aPTT ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) .
