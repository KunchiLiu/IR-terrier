	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency ( ID ) without anemia still main public health problem sub-Saharan Africa Southern Asia , especially vulnerable population group child 5 year age woman reproductive age . The etiology ID multifactorial ; major cause low iron dietary bioavailability intake monotonous cereal-based diet aggravate chronic parasitic infection malaria soil-transmitted helminthes . Approaches dietary diversification , supplementation pharmacological iron dos , public health measure ( e.g . deworming , malaria control ) food fortification different iron compound notably reduce morbidity mortality cause ID universally successful . Biofortification new promise approach combat micronutrient deficiency ID . It define process increase content bioavailability essential nutrient iron crop traditional plant breeding and/or genetic engineering . Pearl millet staple food many people live different area West Africa ( e.g . Northern Benin ) India , two part world , ID still widely prevalent . Therefore , pearl millet one crop target iron biofortification HarvestPlus . To improve human iron status successfully , additional iron gain biofortification least bioavailable iron regular peal millet variety . For reason planning iron absorption study investigate iron bioavailability iron-biofortified millet variety compare iron bioavailability regular-iron millet variety regular-iron millet fortify post-harvest ferrous sulfate ( FeSO4 ) . Iron absorption determine incorporation label iron erythrocyte , least 14 day administration test meal contain label iron ( stable isotope technique ) . The three different test meal base 1 ) regular-iron , 2 ) iron-biofortified 3 ) post-harvest iron-fortified millet administer multiple meal i.e . study participant consume test meal period 5 day ( 2 portions/day ; one morning , one lunch ) . Twenty apparently healthy Beninese woman low/marginal iron status ( serum ferritin &lt; 25 ; g/L ) , non-anemic mildly anemic ( hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L ) , 18-30 year age body weight &lt; 65 kg normal body mass index include study . The result study provide important insight iron bioavailability regular , biofortified post-harvest fortified staple crop pearl millet feed multiple meal part complex diet . The result apply different meal base pearl millet West African millet paste Indian flat bread .</brief_summary>
