	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety resorbable polymer implant ( Soft Tissue Regeneration 's L-C Ligament ) replacement regeneration anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) . Approximately 15 patient 2-3 different hospital Europe participate study . The hypothesis study L-C Ligament successfully regenerate ACL clinical outcome similar well surgical intervention auto graft tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Resorbable PLLA Implant Regeneration Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reconstruction ACL currently recommend standard care follow ACL tear rupture . The ACL poor heal potential repair damage tissue rarely successful . The gold standard reconstruction ACL autograft tissue , patellar hamstring tendon common . The limitation autograft donor site morbidity pain , potential damage remain tissue harvest site . Other problem include limited amount tendon available harvesting , unpredictable resorption characteristic , increase recovery time . Allografts tissue patellar , hamstring , Achilles tendon obtain cadaver . The advantage surgery allograft less pain scarring , decrease surgical time , fast rehabilitation . However , allografts transmit disease , may elicit unfavorable immunogenic response , incorporate slower autograft . Also , allograft sterilize without damage tissue , lead choice risk bacterial infection decrease tensile strength heal potential . The propose study prospective , consecutive , non-randomized , multicentre clinical trial conduct five European site , wherein 15 study subject undergo primary ACL reconstruction L-C Ligament . After screen procedure complete , eligible study subject provide write informed consent enrol study . Subjects undergo preoperative clinical , MRI , radiographic evaluation undergo primary ACL reconstruction . Follow-up clinical evaluation perform post-op ( range 1-8 week ) , 3 month ( ± 3 week ) , 6 month ( ± 3 week ) , 12 month ( ± 1 month ) , 24 month ( ± 2 month ) surgery . Assessment safety ( i.e. , assessment adverse event complication ) , pain , clinical function well image occur . In accordance separate radiographic protocol , analysis score MRI image ( pre-op , 1 2 year ) , radiograph ( pre- post- op ) , CT scan post-op 1-year undertaken independent radiologist mask identity subject clinical investigator . Outcome measure image include position bone tunnels interference screw , indirect evidence ligament tissue remodeling , evidence tunnel-widening . Evidence OA also monitor . The Principal Investigator Co-Investigators ensure complication observe radiograph , MRI , CT image report ethic committee sponsor . The primary objective study evaluate safety L-C Ligament primary ACL reconstruction . Safety evaluate occurrence , frequency , severity intra- post- operative complication ; primary end point one year follow-up wil perform minimum two year . Clinical function assess IKDC-2000 Scale functionality device two year follow-up . The secondary objective study determine efficacy objectively subjectively measure pain , function , result image analyse L-C Ligament primary ACL reconstruction . Objective measure include Lachman test , anterior drawer test , KT-1000 Arthrometer , pivot-shift test , single-leg hop test . Pre- post- operative objective subjective measure include Tegner Lysholm scale . Pre- post- op radiograph , MRI image pre-op , 1 2 year , post-op 1-year CT scan analyzed position bone tunnels screw , indirect evidence ligament tissue remodeling , evidence widen bone tunnel .</detailed_description>
