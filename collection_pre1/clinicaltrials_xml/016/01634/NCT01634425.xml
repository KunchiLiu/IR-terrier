	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine early diagnosis risk stratification acquire pre-hospital clinical assessment , 12-lead electrocardiogram point care biomarkers facilitate enhanced triage treatment patient presume non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Providing Rapid Out Hospital Acute Cardiovascular Treatment ( PROACT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Utilizing platform pre-hospital STEMI research clinical experience develop past decade ; intend investigate best achieve timely diagnosis risk stratification patient present pre-hospital emergency medical service symptoms suspicious acute NSTEMI utilization systematic clinical assessment , pre-hospital 12 lead electrocardiogram point care measurement biomarkers . Additionally , deem appropriate patient enrol clinical Chest Pain Protocol utilize pre-hospital biomarkers . We hypothesize establish pre-hospital diagnosis condition may facilitate efficient triage -as appropriate- in-hospital disposition . Additionally , enhance pre-hospital assessment population facilitate appropriate timely disposition patient find acute cardiovascular disease . These process facilitate decant frequently overcrowd resource Emergency Departments .</detailed_description>
