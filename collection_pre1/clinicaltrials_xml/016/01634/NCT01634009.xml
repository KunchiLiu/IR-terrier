	<brief_summary>SAM define weight-for-height ( WH ) less - 3 Z score bi-pedal nutritional edema important cause death child globally include Bangladesh . The death rate among child hospitalize SAM still high . Severe malnutrition child successfully treat use WHO guideline without minor modification . Since Community Based Therapeutic Care ( CTC ) /CMAM approach develop , use RUTF treatment child SAM gain ground , huge amount RUTF use particularly African country . RUTFs energy-dense lipid paste enrich vitamin mineral . The typical composition ( ingredient % weight ) RUTF whole milk powder 30 % ; sugar 28 % ; vegetable oil 15.4 % ; peanut paste 25 % ; mineral vitamin mix 1.6 % . Although CTC model promise treatment SAM considerably low cost previous inpatient model , cost RUTF still consider significant barrier universal roll-out SAM treatment make CTC implementation expensive many high-need country . The single expensive raw ingredient RUTF milk powder , contribute around 50 % raw ingredient cost 30-35 % total cost final product . Isolated soy protein cost per kg protein normally skim whole milk powder , thus reduce total cost RUTF . In addition , isolate soy protein ( ISP ) high quality , complete protein meet daily protein requirement grow child adult . ISP highly digestible protein [ FAO/WHO , 1991 ] amino acid profile show achieve Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score ( PDCAAS ) 1.00 , comparable milk egg , show maintain nitrogen balance feed sole protein source minimum recommend intake level . To compare efficacy ( weight gain , rate weight gain change lean body mass ) standard RUTF RUTF make ISP ( Soy-RUTF ) randomize double mask intervention trial 300 SAM child age 6 59 month completion stabilization phase Dhaka Hospital icddr , b Bangladesh study . They randomly receive standard- Soy-RUTF take home follow ( weekly achieve -2 WHZ , thereafter fortnightly achieve -1 WHZ ) nutrition follow unit outpatient department Dhaka Hospital icddr , b .</brief_summary>
