	<brief_summary>Patients recurrent , refractory metastatic solid tumor dismal prognosis viable treatment option . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) agent widely use treat malaria . Because HCQ also inhibit autophagy , process central survival cancer face metabolic stress , include effect anti-cancer therapy , human cancer trial combine agent attempt boost efficacy agent . Autophagy inhibition improve activity sorafenib hepatocellular carcinoma . Sorafenib oral multi-kinase inhibitor block receptor tyrosine kinase KIT , VEGFR PDGFR also serine/threonine kinase along RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway . The investigator propose treat patient refractory relapse solid tumor sorafenib , boost efficacy attempt mitigate toxicity combine HCQ .</brief_summary>
