	<brief_summary>Background : preliminary data show erythrocyte-bound apolipoprotein B ( ery-apoB ) may protective atherosclerosis . However , statin may effect ery-apoB . Objective : investigate effect statins ery-apoB level . Study design : non-randomized intervention study . Ery-apoB measure twice volunteer statin therapy medical reason . After baseline measurement ery-apoB volunteer discontinue statin use period six week follow second measurement ery-apoB . Consecutively subject start original statin therapy . Study population : patient statin therapy age 18 year old . Intervention : temporary discontinuation statin therapy period six week . Main study endpoint : change ery-apoB level . Risks , burden benefit participation : volunteer visit outpatient clinic twice , second visit exactly six week first visit . The volunteer ' general practitioner medical specialist ( internist cardiologist ) inform participation . Subjects fast 10 hour every visit venous blood sample draw visit ( total 36ml blood ) . Subjects discontinue usual statin therapy period six week . No major risk involve temporary discontinuation statin therapy stable chronic cardiovascular disease . Volunteers receive 25 euro 's total participation . Participation serve investigate relation statin potentially beneficial binding apoB erythrocyte .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erythrocyte-bound Apolipoprotein B After Withdrawal Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Previously show atherogenic apolipoprotein ( apo ) B contain lipoprotein bind erythocytes.1-3 Studies laboratory show bind apoB erythrocyte ( ery-apoB ) may reflect situation protection cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) .4 Mean ery-apoB significantly low subject know CVD compare healthy control . However , use statin could important confound factor , know LDL-C serum apoB lower effects.5 , 6 In on-going study population 91 % patient CVD statin therapy compare 19 % subject without CVD . Preliminary data show least effect statin therapy ery-apoB . A modest , significant negative correlation find ery-apoB serum apoB LDL-cholesterol subject without statin ( Pearson 's r -0.172 -0.185 , P &lt; 0.05 ) correlation lose subject use statin . Statins know inhibition HMG-CoA reductase , necessary liver synthesize cholesterol , increase expression hepatic LDL-receptors result lower LDL-cholesterol related apoB.7 , 8 In theory ery-apoB may lower statin well , could explanation difference ery-apoB subject without CVD . This interventional study explore effect statin therapy ery-apoB . AIM : To investigate effect statin therapy plasma level erythrocyte-bound apolipoprotein B. HYPOTHESIS : Ery-apoB increase statin withdrawal due high total plasma apoB . METHODS AND MATERIALS : Study population Subjects males female age 18 year old statin therapy medical purpose like primary secondary hypercholesterolemia presence CVD . Exclusion criterion unstable angina pectoris , acute cardiovascular event ( i.e . myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention , stroke bypass surgery ) last 6 month use lipid lower drug like ezetimibe fibrates besides statin therapy last 6 month . Study design A total 53 subject visit outpatient clinic twice . The following procedure perform first visit : - Questionnaire obtain information patient 's medical history , medication profile general practitioner contact information . - Measurement anthropometric variable ( blood pressure , length , weight waist ) . - Venipuncture ( 1 Clot tube , 1 Heparin tube , 1 EDTA tube 1 Glucose tube , total 18ml blood ) . - Temporary discontinuation statin therapy 6 week . Six week first visit participate subject attend outpatient clinic another venipuncture ( 1 Clot tube , 1 Heparin tube , 1 EDTA tube 1 Glucose tube , total 18ml blood ) . Subjects start original statin therapy afterwards ( type drug dosage ) . However , statin therapy initiate earlier subject suffers acute cardiovascular event study period . Study subject monitor phone adverse event 8 week finish study . Intervention Statin therapy discontinue period six week . Analytical determination Basic parameter renal function well glucose , CRP , total cholesterol , HDL-C TG determine use Synchrom LX analyzer ( Beckman Coulter , Anaheim CA , USA ) . LDL-C value calculate use Friedewald formula . ApoAI ApoB determine rate nephelometry use IMAGE commercially available kit provide Beckman ( Beckman Coulter Anaheim CA , USA ) . Blood cell count determine automatically use LH analyzer ( Beckman Coulter , CA , USA ) . The leukocyte differentiation determine five-part differentiation instrument . ApoB blood cell detect indirect immunofluorescence evaluate flow cytometry , previously validate published.9 Required material - Flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , USA ) - Validated measurement protocol ery-apoB flow cytometry - Venous blood draw equipment blood tube - Funding : Stichting Onderzoek &amp; Ontwikkeling Sint Franciscus Gasthuis Klinisch Chemisch Laboratorium Sint Franciscus Gasthuis cover cost Investigational product The medication group statins product investigation . The frequently prescribe statin simvastatin , atorvastatin , rosuvastatin , pravastatin fluvastatin dosages range 5mg 80mg administer daily.10 Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase , necessary liver synthesize cholesterol , subsequently lower LDL-cholesterol related apo B.7 , 8 Atorvastatin rosuvastatin show long terminal half-life ( 11-14 hour ) compare statin ( 1-3 hour ) .11 Bioavailability statins low due extensive first-pass effect intestinally liver pravastatin show active metabolites.11 All active metabolite statin eliminate discontinuation statin six week . Statistics Subjects serve control group . Therefore , pair T test use test significant difference ery-apoB withdrawal statin therapy . The difference ery-apoB withdrawal statin therapy check normality use Shapiro-Wilk test . A P-value 0.05 regarded statistical significant . Ongoing observational study show mean difference 0.25 subject without statin therapy . A recently complete pilot show SD difference 0.64 instead previously estimate SD 0.50 . To demonstrate significant difference ery-apoB mean difference 0.25 a.u . SD difference 0.64 , least 53 subject include analysis ( power 80 % , alpha 0.05 two-sided ) . Safety report The investigator inform subject review accredit METC anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit METC , except insofar suspicion jeopardize subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep informed . Adverse event ( AE ) define undesirable experience occur subject study , whether consider related investigated treatment . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investigator staff record . A serious adverse event ( SAE ) untoward medical occurrence effect dose result death , life threatening , require hospitalization prolongation exist patient ' hospitalization , result persistent disability incapacity affect safety subject way . These serious adverse event report web portal `` Toetsing Online '' accredit METC approve protocol . Adverse event may expect regard withdrawal statin period six week occurrence acute cardiovascular event `` statin withdrawal syndrome '' . Studies show discontinuation statin therapy associate bad outcome acute coronary syndrome , stroke vascular surgery.12 However , increase adverse outcome observe patient stable chronic coronary artery disease follow temporary discontinuation statin therapy.12 The prevalence statin related muscle complaint 1-10 % .13 However , risk statin related muscle complaint restart statin withdrawal four week small since study subject already statin participation study . There clear evidence significant harm effect quality life cause statin group 34.272 study subjects.14</detailed_description>
