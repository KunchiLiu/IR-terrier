The investigator also expect provide service help child autism improve language , social , academic skill . The investigator expect gain make child help relieve many daily stressor worry family child autism . Children autism lack adaptive skill require constant help supervision parent . Thus , improvement child 's function allow child become independent decrease parent stress associate need constantly watch help child . Because EIBI service produce lasting improvement long intervention end , project provide short-term long-term benefit child participate study , provide last relief dedicate military family . In long-term , project may really change way ( military non-military ) child family get effective service get . Also , result may help professional researcher psychology medicine .

Adults anywhere world least high school diploma formal training ABA train basic principle ABA implement EIBI therapy 90 % accuracy . Individuals receive technology-enhanced training remotely outperform randomly assign waitlist-control group knowledge competency-based test . 3 . Specific Aim : Technology-enhanced EIBI service . The investigator demonstrate technology-enhanced telehealth provide remote access efficient effective EIBI service military family affect autism . - Hypothesis : Technology-enhanced EIBI service . Young child autism military family receive EIBI service supervise University Nebraska Medical Center ( UNMC ) expert remotely via technology-enhanced telehealth show mark improvement cognitive , language , social , play , adaptive skill decrease problem behavior relative child randomly assign wait-list control group . 4 . Specific Aim : Reducing stress military family affect autism . The investigator show provision efficient effective EIBI service use technology-enhanced telehealth reduce family stress among military family affect autism . - Hypothesis : Reducing stress military family affect autism . Military parent child autism receive technology-enhanced EIBI service show reduction self-reported stress level Child Domain Parent Domain subscales Parenting Stress Index ( Abidin , 1995 ) relative parent waitlist-control group .</detailed_description>
