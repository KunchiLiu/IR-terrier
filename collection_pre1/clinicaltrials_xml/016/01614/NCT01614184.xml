	<criteria>Female patient Ability provide inform consent sign approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline . Between 18 90 year age . Have diagnose invasive adenocarcinoma , highgrade ductal carcinoma insitu . If core open biopsy do , must demonstrate invasive adenocarcinoma . If FNA do , must positive accompany positive clinical breast examination ultrasound mammography . The tumor must operable . Clinically negative lymph node . Must bilateral mammogram within year enrollment . The interval initial cytologic histologic diagnosis breast cancer enrollment must 60 day . ECOG performance status 01 Patients diagnosis breast cancer obtain utilizing fine needle aspiration cytology core needle biopsy prefer . However , patient diagnose open biopsy procedure eligible . Patients prior excisional biopsy lumpectomy eligible entry . Patients prior nonbreast malignancy eligible disease free 5 year enrollment . Patients squamous basal cell carcinoma skin effectively treat , carcinoma situ cervix treat operation , LCIS ipsilateral contralateral breast treat surgery eligible , even condition diagnose within 5 year enrollment onto study . Male patient Ulceration , erythema , infiltration skin underlie chest wall ( complete fixation ) , peau d'orange , skin edema magnitude . ( Tethering dimple skin nipple inversion interpret skin infiltration . Patients latter condition eligible . ) One ipsilateral axillary lymph node positive tumor clinical examination . Bilateral malignancy mass opposite breast suspicious malignancy , unless biopsy prof mass malignant . Previous removal ipsilateral axillary lymph node . Diffuse tumor multiple malignant tumor different quadrant breast . Suspicious palpable node contralateral axilla palpable supraclavicular infraclavicular node . Patients condition consider ineligible unless biopsy evidence involve tumor . Patients prior breast malignancy LCIS . Prior treatment breast cancer include irradiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , and/or hormonal therapy . Allergy radiocolloid fluorescein . Inability localize SLN drainage basins via lymphatic mapping . ( e.g. , basin find emits gammaradiation injection technetium 99 ) Organic brain syndrome significant impairment basal cognitive function psychiatric disorder might preclude participation protocol , exacerbate therapy . Breast cancer relate operative procedure correspond criterion describe protocol . Primary secondary immune deficiency know significant autoimmune disease would pose risk participant base physician 's judgment . History organ transplantation . Pregnant lactating woman . Participation concurrent experimental protocol alternative therapy might confound analysis trial . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( e.g. , cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) preclude patient subject treatment option would prevent prolonged followup base physician 's judgment .</criteria>
