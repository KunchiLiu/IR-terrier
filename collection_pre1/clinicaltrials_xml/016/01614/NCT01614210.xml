	<detailed_description>Patients eligible ( newly diagnose hormone positive clinical stage 1 2 breast cancer ) approach study . If sign inform consent prescription 21 dos Tamoxifen provide . The patient 's surgery schedule time convenient patient surgeon . Once surgery schedule , medication calendar complete allows patient take tamoxifen 7 day preoperatively 7th dose tamoxifen coincide day surgery . The patient continue take tamoxifen 2 week ( 14 day ) surgery . Patients proceed along normal treatment guideline .

For go additional therapy , prescription endocrine therapy write initial post-operative visit . Unstained slides formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue block patient 's breast tissue original diagnosis breast cancer make H &amp; E stain Ki67 . After endocrine therapy subsequent resection , carcinoma confirm participate pathologist H &amp; E , Ki67 perform unstained slide representative tissue block contain invasive carcinoma . The pathologist circle designate area tumor H &amp; E slide H &amp; E immunostained ( Ki67 ) slide scan digital imaging device ( Aperio XT Scanscope ) , quantitatively analyzes tumor designate pathologist image analysis algorithm . The algorithm accurately detect region interest distinguishes cell sub-cellular object within target region . It determine morphology expression profile per individual cell cell compartment . For Ki67 analysis , nuclear Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) algorithm use .</detailed_description>
