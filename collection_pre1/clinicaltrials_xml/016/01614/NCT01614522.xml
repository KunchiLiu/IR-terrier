	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether ASLAN001 effect patient recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma stomach , gastrooesophageal junction , low third oesophagus whose tumour over-express HER-1 HER-2 , whose tumours HER-2 gene-amplified . Maximum 26 patient participate South Korea patient assign either group A group B accord result test do tumor tissue obtain biopsy determine HER-1 HER-2 status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluating Effect ASLAN001 Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Gastric Cancer Whose Tumors Are Either HER-2 Amplified Co-expressing HER-1 HER-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 1 million new case gastric cancer estimate occur 2008 ( 988,000 case , 7.8 % total ) , make currently fourth common malignancy world , behind cancer lung , breast , colo-rectum . Gastric cancer also second lead cause cancer-related death sex worldwide 700,000 death occur annually . The incidence mortality rate gastric cancer vary widely different region world . The incidence dramatically decline United States rank seventh cause cancer- related death . In Asia-Pacific region , high incidence gastric cancer find China , Japan , Korea , age standardize incidence rate ( ASR ) great 20 per 100,000 population . Intermediate risk country ( ASR 11-19/100,000 population ) include Malaysia , Singapore , Taiwan , low-risk country ( ASR &lt; 10/100,000 population ) include Australia , New Zealand , India , Thailand . Approximately 95 % malignant gastric neoplasm adenocarcinomas . One strike epidemiologic observation increase incidence adenocarcinoma involve proximal stomach distal oesophagus include oesophagogastric junction . These tumour think different etiologic factor ; gastric body antral lesion associate low acid production Helicobacter pylorus infection , whereas cardiac lesion associate either . The treatment advance un-resectable disease remain essentially unchanged past 2 decade , platinum fluoro-pyridine-based combination chemotherapy mainstay therapy . The molecular biology responsible carcinogenesis , tumour biology , response therapy gastric cancer active area investigation . Amplification and/or over-expression epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER 2 ) find promote tumourigenesis involve pathogenesis gastric cancer . Recently , data randomise study trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) patient HER 2 amplification demonstrate significant improvement outcome comparison chemotherapy alone . Studies number molecularly target agent use alone combination chemotherapy undertaken , ongoing . Translational research , undertaken part study , demonstrate great molecular heterogeneity disease , multiple growth factor survival pathway implicate . In view , successful therapeutic intervention likely require identification molecularly define subset disease , evaluation rationally-selected combination target agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient 21 year age old time write informed consent obtain . Patients histologically confirm adenocarcinoma stomach , gastrooesophageal junction distal oesophagus inoperable locallyadvanced metastatic disease . Patients tumours immunohistochemical evidence expression HER1 ( level + ++ +++ ) HER2 ( level + ++ +++ ) use standard criterion OR tumours geneamplification HER2 standard FISH . Patient receive 1 prior chemotherapy treatment adenocarcinoma stomach , gastrooesophageal junction distal oesophagus metastatic disease . Patients prior partial gastrectomy take oral medication , undergo gastroendoscopic biopsy meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Patients measurable nonmeasurable disease per modify RECIST guideline . All scan xrays use document measurable nonmeasurable disease must do within 28day period prior enrollment . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( within 14 day prior enrolment ) . Patient adequate organ haematological function evidence follow laboratory study within 14 day prior enrollment : Haematological function , follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L Haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Coagulation function , follow : Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) per institutional laboratory normal range International normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 Renal function , follow : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Urea ≤ 1.5 x ULN Hepatic function , follow : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) / alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) * . Except due direct disease involvement liver discretion investigator . Patients unable swallow oral medication Patients persistent gastric outlet obstruction , complete dysphagia feed jejunostomy . Patients underwent radiotherapy gastric remnant ≤ 14 day prior enrolment . Patients must recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . Patients total gastrectomy . Patients uncontrolled , clinically significant symptomatic cardiovascular disease within 6 month prior enrolment , include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , grade 2 great peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , congestive heart failure arrhythmia control outpatient medication . Patients ongoing clinically significant active infection judge Investigator . Pregnant ( i.e. , positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin test ) breastfeed woman .</criteria>
