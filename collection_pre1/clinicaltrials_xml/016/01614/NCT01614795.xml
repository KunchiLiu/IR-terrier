	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well cixutumumab temsirolimus work treat patient recurrent refractory sarcoma . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cixutumumab temsirolimus together may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate combination cixutumumab temsirolimus patient relapse refractory osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival patient treat disease stratum drug combination . II . To assess incidence insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) , insulin receptor , ERK , RON , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway activation archival tumor material , correlate response . III . To evaluate minimal residual disease IGF-1R tumor cell expression blood bone marrow Ewing sarcoma patient use flow cytometry . IV . To describe toxicity ( include dose-limiting toxicity ) cixutumumab temsirolimus administer schedule . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( osteosarcoma v Ewing sarcoma/PNET v rhabdomyosarcoma v non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ) . Patients receive cixutumumab IV 1 hour temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 25 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue sample recent biopsy collect analyzed IGF-1R , insulin receptor , AKT , ERK , mTOR , S6 kinase pathway activation immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) bank future correlative study . Blood bone marrow sample , patient Ewing sarcoma , may collect baseline periodically treatment minimal residual disease analysis flow cytometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
