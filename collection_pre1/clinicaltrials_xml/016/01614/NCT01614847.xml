	<brief_summary>Background : Osmolarity define concentration particle dissolve solution . Normal tear contain various dissolved particle include protein , salt electrolyte . The investigator plan investigate osmolarity tear film change time instillation artificial tear contain hyaluronate . This one kind artificial tear use treat dry eye . Dry eye tear osmolarity : Dry eye significant health problem , diagnosis treatment often ambiguous ineffective . There resurgence interest research dry eye past 5 year , tear osmolarity emerge perhaps , one effective way evaluate tear quality dry eye status . Dry eye usually treat artificial tear , many formulation available . The investigator test isotonic solution contains hyaluronate . Hyaluronate bind water help maintain water eye . Objective : We plan study time course possible change tear film osmolarity follow instillation isotonic artificial tear contain hyaluronate . The investigator use TearLab , new clinical instrument develop quickly easily measure tear film osmolarity . Understanding artificial tear affect tear film osmolarity time help doctor determine efficacy dose schedule . The investigator test isotonic hyaluronate ( Blink Contacts ) artificial tear relative normal saline solution . Hypothesis : The investigator able measure decrease tear osmolarity time follow instillation due water-binding effect hyaluronate artificial tear relative control ( normal saline solution ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tear Osmolarity Changes After Instilling Isotonic Hyaluronate Artificial Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT : Introduction : Tear hyper-osmolarity may fundamental cause dry eye many case . Hyaluronate agent use artificial tear , bind water protect evaporation . It may therefore effective treatment tear hyper-osmolarity . Purpose : Our purpose measure change tear osmolarity time follow instillation Blink Contacts , isotonic ocular lubricant contain hyaluronate . We hypothesize even isotonic solution , water-binding property hyaluronate would reduce tear osmolarity . This help u good understand efficacy treatment develop rational basis dose schedule . Methods : After baseline osmolarity measurement , eight subject receive either Blink Contacts normal saline drop eye . We re-measured osmolarity five minute later , 15-minute interval 95 minute . Subjects also rat comfort time . The next day , experiment repeat alternate drop subject . Results : There statistically clinically significant decrease tear osmolarity time either Blink Contacts normal saline , significant difference drop . Comfort rating show significant difference time . Conclusions : We conclude , although hyaluronate bind water , significantly alter tear osmolarity osmolarity similar tear . However , may reduce osmolarity hypotonic relative tear . Small sample size , eye hyperosmolarity limitation method may affect result .</detailed_description>
