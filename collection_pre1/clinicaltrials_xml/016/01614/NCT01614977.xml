	<brief_summary>Nontuberculous mycobacteriae ( NTM ) group bacteria typically cause infection lymph node neck face otherwise healthy child . There currently 3 strategy manage infection . Yet , `` ideal '' downside . 1 . Surgery : removal affect lymph node common approach disadvantage potential facial nerve paralysis , possibility recurrent infection would require another operation resolution cosmetically disturb scar . 2 . Antibiotics : The antibiotic course prolong associate frequently adverse reaction . It unclear treatment significant effect `` natural '' resolution process infection . 3 . Observation : follow-up healing process without intervention . However resolution may last long period time even year . In almost case spontaneous discharge pu involve lymph node onto skin may last day . Later scar form may also disturb cosmetically . The inflammatory response body infection may occasionally severe . As matter fact harmful consequence sometimes serious bacteria cause infection . Prednisone anti inflammatory drug property could possibly prevent . There medical experience use prednisone similar drug addition antibiotic infectious disease decrease inflammatory response infection . One infection tuberculosis . The tuberculous bacteria common feature nontuberculous mycobacteria . The investigator believe inflammatory process infect lymph node nontuberculous mycobacteria major cause discharge skin later lead formation scar prolong resolution infection . Thus order hasten resolution avoid formation neck facial scar cosmetic consequence suggest use prednisone treat nontuberculus mycobacteria lymph nodes infection . Since prednisone depress inflammatory process well immunity response , choose study effect prednisone combine antibiotic ( later help overcome bacteria ) . The purpose study determine whether addition prednisone antibiotic treatment nontuberculous mycobacteria lymph nodes infection neck face child hasten resolution process improve cosmetic result . The diagnosis nontuberculous mycobacteria lymph node infection base evidence bacterial growth culture presence DNA bacteria pu obtain involved lymph node fine needle aspiration . Generally healthy child evidence infection offer participate study . They randomly assign follow 2 group 8 week treatment : 1 . Antibiotics ( 2 type ) prednisone . 2 . Antibiotics ( 2 type ) placebo ( material taste look like prednisone medical effect ) . Prednisone give dose decrease half twice : 2 four week . Follow-up visit monitor inflammatory process resolution well adverse reaction do around 2 week , 4 week 3 month 6-8 month begin therapy , Blood test chest X-rays take prior begin treatment . Blood test also take first follow-up visit . A photo face neck site involve lymph node take start therapy follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Antibiotic Therapy Alone Combined With Corticosteroids Treatment Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Cervicofacial Lymphadenitis Children : A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare effect antimyocbacterial therapy alone combined corticosteroid treatment NTM lymphadenitis child . The study conduct 3-year period Day Hospitalization Unit ward C Schneider Children 's Medical Center Israel use double- blind placebo-controlled design . Eighty child age 3 month 20 year treat laboratory-proven subacute/chronic NTM lymphadenitis Schneider Children 's Medical Center Israel enrol study . Children follow finding exclude : - congenital acquire immunodeficiency - chronic disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure , chronic liver disease , inflammatory bowel disease , chronic arthritis - immunosuppressive drug use ( except inhale steroid ) - elevate hepatocellular enzyme level ( twice upper limit normal ) -- - clinical suspicion tuberculosis first-degree relative tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
