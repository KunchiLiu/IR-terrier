	<brief_summary>The purpose study test performance investigational Bayer Blood Glucose ( BG ) meter five additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems ( BGMSs ) . The goal obtain glucose sample subject diabetes across meter operating range . A capillary sample collect subject 3 different time visit obtain natural capillary blood sample range glucose concentration . Some blood sample glycolyzed low glucose concentration level glucose solution add sample raise glucose concentration level . All meter BG result compare plasma result obtain reference laboratory glucose method ( YSI Glucose Analyzer ) . All lancings test perform study staff .</brief_summary>
