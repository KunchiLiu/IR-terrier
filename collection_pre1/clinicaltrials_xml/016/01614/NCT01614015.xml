	<brief_summary>The propose effectiveness study examines difference treatment outcomes observation-based supervision ( BOOST ) versus supervision usual ( SAU ) . The study implement within 16 team deliver FFT service 11 site California Institute Mental Health ( CIMH ) system . The 16 FFT therapist team randomly assign either BOOST SAU . Each team 3 therapist treat 6 family total 18 family per team . Thus , condition include 24 therapist treat 144 family . The project implement four stagger wave establish even rate data collection treatment implementation enhance feasibility study keep staff project cost constant across 5-year project . Each wave involve 4 FFT team , 2 receive BOOST 2 receive SAU . Teams randomize supervision condition . Outcome assessments parent adolescent conduct baseline 4 month 16 month treatment initiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Building Outcomes With Observation-Based Supervision : An FFT Effectiveness Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study design evaluate two distinct approach therapist supervision implementation Functional Family Therapy ( FFT ) , EBT adolescent substance abuse delinquent/behavior problem . The impetus propose research emerge large scale dissemination study conduct Washington State Institute Public Policy . The study identify two key finding : ( 1 ) Only half therapist actually implement FFT model competent manner , ( 2 ) positive outcome , i.e . reduction felony recidivism , evident therapist implement model competently . For subset competent FFT therapist , financial benefit dissemination estimate $ 7.50 dollar program cost . Based accumulated evidence support FFT , interest disseminate FFT treatment model skyrocket . Currently , dissemination organization , FFT LLC , train 270 local , state , national international organization . Over 1100 FFT therapist serve 12,000 family around globe , large scale multi-site implementation ongoing California , Washington , Pennsylvania , New York , Florida , Netherlands . To address key issue enhance treatment competence , FFT LLC recently develop implement sophisticated web-based application design monitor highly structure FFT therapist progress note , well supervisor client rating therapist competence . The process help maximize sustainability community program limit cost . Hence , supervision process involve feedback therapist base progress note therapist-supervisor discussion therapist performance . The impact supervision process therapist competence treatment outcomes unknown . By contrast , Miller colleague find supervision involve active feedback and/or coach base supervisor review therapy session observe therapist behavior directly result improve model fidelity . Such observation-based supervision hallmark development family therapy model fidelity monitor process efficacy trial evaluate family therapy addiction treatment . By eliminate practice , possible FFT dissemination effort may unwittingly omit one important component need effective transfer treatment . During early period research dissemination , vital identify specific procedure likely maximize effective translation efficacious treatment community setting . Observation-based supervision family therapy play critical role development clinical practice efficacy trial establish positive effect youth outcomes . Hence , key first step effectiveness research examine extent supervision practice involve therapist report observation therapist behavior session influence therapist competence subsequent treatment outcome . The cost associate supervision base direct review therapy session recording often view prohibitive community implementation EBTs . However , potential sustainability community implementation must consider context empirical evidence procedure relation outcomes achieve . If intensive supervision practice enhance competence produce superior outcome , economic analysis evaluate supervision cost , cost effectiveness , cost-benefit would essential . Such analysis would ultimately drive policy consideration respect fund EBTs community level maximize long-term financial societal benefit . Study Aims The purpose propose study examine effect observation-based supervision ( BOOST ) versus standard supervision usual ( SAU ) approach currently use FFT LLC therapist competence adolescent outcomes community-based sample adolescent receive FFT . The study implement 16 FFT team affiliate California Institute Mental Health ( CIMH ) , coordinate center stakeholder implement FFT community agency California . Of 16 team , 14 team 10 community-based agency affiliate CIMH 2 team FFT team within Los Angeles County Probation . Participants include three therapist 16 FFT team ( n=48 ) 6 adolescents/families per therapist ( n=288 ) . All adolescent refer participate study FFT team within Los Angeles County Probation youth `` home probation . '' In addition , youth refer study community-based organization include `` home probation '' youth ( e.g. , Star View Behavioral Health ) ( e.g. , Long Beach Adolescent Program ) . Similarly , youth refer community-based organization participate study may child welfare involvement . Therapist team randomly assign either BOOST SAU . The aim study follow : Specific Aim 1 : To examine difference BOOST SAU improve treatment outcome . Specifically , hypothesize BOOST associate significantly great reduction adolescent substance use ( Aim 1a ) conduct disturbance/delinquent behavior ( Aim 1b ) SAU . Specific Aim 2 : To examine difference BOOST SAU improve engagement retention treatment . Specifically , hypothesize BOOST associate significantly high rate engagement retention treatment . Family therapy intervention base largely premise dysfunctional family process play central role development adolescent problem behavior substance use delinquency . Family therapy aim mitigate dysfunctional process . The success family therapy improve family function youth outcome , note , depend fidelity treatment implementation general therapist competent adherence treatment model particular . Thus : Specific Aim 3 : To examine difference BOOST SAU improve therapist competence family function . Specifically , hypothesize BOOST associate significantly great rate therapist competence ( Aim 3a ) improvement family functioning ( Aim 3b ) SAU . Exploratory Aim 4 : To explore potential mediating effect therapist competence family function treatment outcome . Specifically , explore whether therapist competence mediates ( Aim 4a ) association supervision condition youth outcome ( substance use , conduct/delinquent behavior ) , improvement family functioning , great rate engagement retention treatment . We also explore whether improvement family functioning ( Aim 4b ) mediate link supervision condition youth outcome ( substance use , conduct/delinquent behavior ) .</detailed_description>
