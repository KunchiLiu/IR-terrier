	<brief_summary>Post-discharge mortality re-hospitalization acute heart failure ( AHF ) affect 15 % 30 % patient respectively , within 90 day . With 1 million annual hospitalization financial cost exceed 20 billion dollar , AHF major public health burden . Yet AHF therapy date definitively reduce morbidity mortality , stark contrast heart attack patient , highly rat evidence guideline exist . Although AHF syndrome one disease , typical treatment patient hospitalize AHF suggest otherwise . Despite substantial difference among AHF patient , therapy largely uniform ; patient receive medicine help get rid excess volume little else . Although decade empirical use support symptomatic benefit traditional therapy , outcomes remain extremely poor . As opposed `` one-size-fits-all‟ approach use unsuccessfully date clinical trial , identification specific AHF patient sub-groups critical , tailored therapy develop test . Preliminary data suggest neurohormone aldosterone may detrimental AHF patient . Furthermore , hormone level appear rise hospitalization . The investigator therefore propose identify specific AHF patient phenotype associate high serum aldosterone level subsequently address hypothesis early aldosterone blockade continue throughout hospitalization decrease re-hospitalization mortality . Specifically , investigator hypothesize AHF patient elevate serum aldosterone level distinct phenotype compare low normal aldosterone level . Specifically , old , low systolic blood pressure , low EF , bad renal function , high BNP , previous hospitalization HF .</brief_summary>
