	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease inherit deficiency lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( GCB ) lead progressive accumulation glucocerebroside within macrophage subsequent tissue organ damage ; typically liver , spleen , bone marrow , brain . The disease classify 3 clinical subtypes base presence absence neurological symptom severity neurological disease . Type 1 Gaucher disease affect estimate 30,000 person worldwide common . Type 1 Gaucher disease involve central nervous system . Patients type 2 Gaucher disease present acute neurological deterioration , lead early death . Those type 3 disease typically display sub-acute neurological course , later onset slow progression . The primary objective study evaluate safety every week dose velaglucerase alfa Japanese patient Gaucher disease . Velaglucerase alfa develop approve enzyme replacement therapy Type 1 Gaucher disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease inherit deficiency lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( GCB ) lead progressive accumulation glucocerebroside within macrophage subsequent tissue organ damage ; typically liver , spleen , bone marrow , brain . Gaucher disease designate list Specified Rare Intractable Diseases Specified Disease Treatment Research Program Ministry Health , Labor Welfare ( MHLW ) one `` lysosomal storage disease '' since 2001 . Gaucher disease also designate Medical Aid Program Specified Categories Chronic Pediatric Diseases . The prevalence mutation phenotype patient Gaucher disease Japan differ non-Japanese population . Some patient type 1 Gaucher disease Japan severe progressive disease compare non-Japanese patient disease characterize earlier onset symptom . Velaglucerase alfa , highly-purified form naturally occur enzyme glucocerebrosidase , develop enzyme replacement therapy Gaucher disease symptom ( anemia , thrombocytopenia , hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , bone manifestation ) . The primary objective study evaluate safety every week dose velaglucerase alfa Japanese patient ( naive previously treat imiglucerase ) 2 year age old Gaucher disease .</detailed_description>
