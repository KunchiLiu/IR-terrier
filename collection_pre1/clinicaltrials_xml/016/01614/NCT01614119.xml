	<brief_summary>While exercise response classically describe cardiorespiratory muscle level , recent data suggest brain also significantly stress exercise may even participate performance limitation . In hypoxia particular , cerebral response exercise may alter promote performance reduction endurance exercise . In present study , investigator use innovative approach assess cerebral perturbation associate exercise hypoxia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In classical paradigm exercise physiology , cardio-respiratory capacity muscle fatigue though set limit exercise tolerance . However , experimental situation possible explain exercise performance limitation use classical paradigm , therefore necessary look alternative . Recent investigation highlight change associate exercise brain , e.g . change cerebral perfusion , cerebral oxygenation neuron excitability . Also , several result suggest condition , central nervous system fail drive motoneuron adequately , i.e . call central fatigue . However , phenomenon central limitation exercise underlie neurophysiological mechanism still clarify . Cerebral metabolism neurohumoral response fatigue exercise therefore investigate order propose new paradigm able explain exercise limitation . Among condition classical paradigm exercise performance limitation appear suit actual observation , exercise hypoxic environment appear particularly challenging . Some data suggest indeed cerebral response exercise may substantially modify hypoxia compare normoxia . Hence , present project , investigator aim evaluate effect hypoxia brain adaptation exercise healthy human . In particular , objective ass brain neurophysiological response fatiguing exercise , include cerebral perfusion oxygenation , cerebral activation , cortical excitability well resultant motor command inhale normoxic hypoxic gas mixture . To fulfil objective , complementary methodological approach use exercise normoxic hypoxic condition : functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use evaluate cerebral activation , perfusion image arterial spin labelling ( ASL ) nuclear magnetic resonance method assess regional cerebral perfusion , near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) allow measurement cerebral oxygenation , measurement motor evoke potential response transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) assess cortical excitability , measurement level central activation ( assessed TMS ) electromyographic ( EMG ) signal evaluate motor command . Moreover , account effect muscle mass involve exercise duration hypoxic exposure , brain adaptation exercise hypoxia assess motor task involve small ( thumb adduction ) large ( knee extension , cycle ergometry ) muscle group well acute ( &lt; 1 hour ) prolong hypoxic exposure ( several hour : 6 hour ) . This multi-technical approach possible collaborative project three partner expert brain function investigation exercise physiology ( Institut Fédératif de Recherche 'RMN Biomédical et Neurosciences ' Joseph Fourier University University Hospital , Grenoble ; 'Exercise Physiology ' Laboratory , University Hospital , St Etienne ; 'Motor Efficiency Deficiency Laboratory ' , Montpellier I University , Montpellier ) . The investigator hypothesise hypoxia would enhance cerebral perturbation associate give fatigue exercise , i.e . would induce great reduction cerebral blood cerebral oxygenation , great reduction cortical excitability central activation well large reduction central command , particularly large muscle mass involve well hypoxic exposure prolong . This project aim renew vision limitation human exercise performance well understanding exercise tolerance hypoxemic condition . The late relevant sport altitude medicine deal exercise altitude tolerance , well diseases characterise hypoxemia exercise intolerance respiratory disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease example .</detailed_description>
