	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety ivacaftor subject cystic fibrosis ( CF ) non-G551D cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) gate mutation ( one follow CFTR mutation : G178R , G551S , S549N , S549R , G970R , G1244E , S1251N , S1255P , G1349D ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ivacaftor Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Who Have Non-G551D CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) Gating Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivacaftor first CFTR modulator show improvement CFTR function clinical benefit subject CF . Results Phase 3 study ( VX08-770-102 [ Study 102 ] [ NCT00909532 ] VX08-770-103 [ Study 103 ] [ NCT00909727 ] ) show ivacaftor effective treatment subject CF G551D-CFTR mutation , evidence sustained improvement CFTR channel function ( measure reduction sweat chloride concentration ) correspond substantial , durable improvement lung function , pulmonary exacerbation , respiratory symptom , weight gain . Ivacaftor also well tolerate , evidence rate reason premature discontinuation result safety assessment . Ivacaftor ( Trade Name Kalydeco ; 150 mg tablet ) initially approve United States treatment CF subject 6 year age old G551D mutation CFTR gene .</detailed_description>
