	<brief_title>Pre- Versus Post-Incisional Pregabalin Postoperative Pain Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregablain Interest focus analgesic , sedative , anxiolytic , opioid¬sparing effect pregabalin ( PGL ) ( S+ 3-isobutyl GABA ) , structural analog GABA derivative gabapentin various pain settingsl include postoperative pain . Of similar mechanism action , think possess superior phannacokinetic profile gabapentin [ 15 ] . Pregabalin variable role neuropathic pain condition , post-herpetic neuralgia , painful diabetic neuropathy , central neuropathic pain , fibromyalgia . Some study demonstrate significant analgesic effect acute , postoperative pain ; others propose PGL effective sedative opioid-sparing effect , useful characteristic control acute pain . Opioid spar effect improve pain score see abdominal pelvic surgery . Its many potential action reduce opioid reqUirements , prevention reduction opioid tolerance , improvement quality opioid analgesia , decrease respiratory depression , relief anxiety , gastriC sparing , make attractive drug consider control pain post operative period . Population characteristics The orthopedic oncological patient specific group individual whose demand antinociception start rather surgery bone tumor-generated pain usually signal first existence pathology . Also , pain intensity generate intervention skeleton intense induce damage soft tissue . Subsequently , patient would require postoperatively analgesics general surgery longer period time . We demonstrate previously acute pain superimpose already arouse eNS , i.e. , presence central sensitization , would create situation complete antinociception hard obtain , patient , therefore efficacy antinociceptive protocol best test , comprise possible transformation acute chronic pain . Pre-emption point beneficial tool reduce perioperative pain . Various technique employ purpose ; different drug use well . The beneficial effect preemptive PGL document patient undergone lumbar discectomy , immediately 1 3 month surgery . Hypothesis No study consider comparison preemptive vs. post-surgery PGL administration , We believe administration PGL preemptively would diminish pain sensation therefore need opioids administration orthopedic-oncologic patient effectively administer start postoperatively . Objectives To assess beneficial effect Of PGL admi '' istered either pre-incisionally post-incisionally immediate late ( 1-and 3 month ) postoperative analgeSia requirement pain score , well satisfaction rate orthopedic oncologic patient .</detailed_description>
