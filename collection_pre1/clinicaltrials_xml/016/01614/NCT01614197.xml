	<brief_title>A Trial Temsirolimus With Etoposide Cyclophosphamide Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show mTOR inhibitor ( MTI ) inhibit growth pre-B T-cell ALL cell line vitro ALL xenograft model . The MTI temsirolimus chosen use study due weekly intravenous dosing , predictable blood level , availability single-agent pediatric MTD sustain biologic effect due conversion sirolimus . This study determine maximum tolerate dose temsirolimus give combination dexamethasone , cyclophosphamide etoposide relapse ALL , LL PTL . A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design use . Response treatment evaluate . Biology test do evaluate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) , temsirolimus ' effect glucocorticoid resistance , mTOR inhibition .</detailed_description>
