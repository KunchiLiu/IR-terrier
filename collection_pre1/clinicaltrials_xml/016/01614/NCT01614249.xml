	<detailed_description>Background study : Fatty acid key build block fat oil , body food . Among essential fatty acid require maintain health , must come diet , omega-3 . These omega-3 fatty acid important constituent cell membrane involve movement substance cell . They also produce hormone-like substance regulate many function body . The omega-3 fatty acid occur naturally , consist short long-chain alphalinolenic acid ( ALA ) long chain , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . The ALA naturally find green leafy vegetable , flax seed , soybean oil walnut . The long chain EPA DHA naturally find dark muscle sea fish salmon , mackerel tuna . These nutrient must consume diet synthesized human [ 1 ] . Research health benefit omega-3 fatty acid date back 1929 find promote growth prevent inflammation skin rat [ 2 , 3 ] . The essentiality long-chain fatty acid human health however emerge 1970 's first total parenteral nutrition fat-free find induce essential fatty acid deficiency among infant volvulus , bowel obstruction , birth [ 4 ] . Further research 1970s health status modern-hunter-gatherer Inuit Eskimos also find related staple diet fatty sea fish fish eat marine mammal rich long chain omega-3 fatty acid , EPA DHA [ 5 ] . It prove omega-3 long chain fatty acid , EPA DHA improve depressive symptom [ 6 , 7 ] . As mood disorder , depression characterize feeling unhappiness hopelessness , generally mark altered mood . It single disease , syndrome encompass spectrum symptom multiple cause [ 8 , 9 ] . Women experience least one episode minor major depression pregnancy childbirth . This however often under-diagnosed , undetected miss due lack screen . Although screen depression may routine activity antenatal care , study screen depression pregnancy indicate 20-30 % pregnant woman depress [ 10 , 11 ] . The prevalence depression high second third trimester pregnancy [ 12 ] maternal level omega-3 fatty acid deplete . Adequate intake long chain omega-3 fatty acid also essential , pregnancy support normal growth maturation many fetal organ system , particularly brain eye [ 13 , 14 ] . Moreover , long chain omega-3 fatty acid critical development function many different organ system fetus , include structure brain retina eye [ 15 ] . Premature birth potential neurological complication may result omega-3 deficiency [ 16 ] . Documented research finding omega-3 fatty acid human immune-deficiency virus/ acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) mainly two-fold : one , plasma triglyceride level , two , immune response parameter . Studies show use omega-3 fatty acid among HIV infect patient receive highly active antiretroviral therapy well tolerate effective reduce plasma triglyceride level [ 17-19 ] . The fish oil therefore recommend second-line therapy HIV patient hypertriglyceridemia [ 12 ] . One metabolic end product long chain fatty acids omega-3 omega-6 , eat absorb body , prostaglandin hormone responsible inflammation response . Research show omega-3 fatty acid produce less prostaglandin omega-6 fatty acid , decrease inflammatory process [ 5 ] . Earlier research report omega-3 fish oil immuno-suppressive significantly decrease various parameter immune response [ 20 ] . However , recent study show dietary intake omega-3 fatty acid increase cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) cell count [ 21 ] The role long chain omega-3 fatty acid combat depression among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman however establish . The specific symptom may responsive omega-3 supplementation also establish . Currently , 2 million pregnant woman estimate live HIV infection globally . In Kenya , 9.0 % pregnant woman HIV-seropositive [ 22 ] health condition well unborn baby silently continue deteriorate partly due depression related comorbidities . This research seek ascertain take omega-3 fish oil supplement high EPA relation DHA significant positive effect depressive symptom among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman compare placebo . It also monitor identify depressive symptom responsive nutrient among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman , manage nutrition supplementation . Conceptual Framework : The major risk factor depression genetic predisposition , hormonal imbalance stressful event could environmental , social psychological origin well nutrition-related factor [ 11 , 23-25 ] . Stressful event could however also cause hormonal imbalance , , process increase stress hormone , cortisol , cause depression [ 23 ] . Both pregnancy HIV infection status also accompany high nutrient demand , presence inadequate inappropriate dietary intake well high intake saturate fat fry food . This likely contribute nutrient deficiency , also determine neurotransmitter function hormonal balance mental health . Problem statement : This study seek ascertain take omega-3 fish oil supplement high EPA relation DHA significant positive effect depressive symptom among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman . The level omega-3 fatty acid rapidly decline pregnancy transfer fetus rapid formation fetal brain cell [ 13 ] . The resultant depletion omega-3 might precipitate occurrence depression pregnant woman unless nutrient deficit meet dietary intake omega-3 rich food supplementation . The modern diet however inadequate long chain omega-3 fatty acid [ 5 ] . About 40 % HIV-seropositive pregnant woman reportedly depress [ 26 , 27 ] . The depression HIV-seropositive pregnant woman significant public health problem due negative effect maternal child health . It may adversely affect quality life adherence HIV/AIDS medication regimens [ 27 , 28 ] may subsequently affect disease progression health outcome [ 29 ] woman . Currently , 2 million pregnant woman estimate live HIV infection globally [ 9 ] . In Kenya , 9.0 % pregnant woman HIV-seropositive [ 22 ] . Justification study : This study contribute debate nutritional support management depressive symptom related health complication HIV infect pregnant woman vulnerable population , improve mental health , hence improve quality life . A reduction prevalence depression could therefore influence nutrition health agency well policy maker make omega-3 fatty acid nutritional supplement accessible HIV positive pregnant woman vulnerable population . Overall aim : To ascertain take omega-3 fish oil supplement high EPA relation DHA significant positive effect depressive symptom compare placebo among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman . Research question : 1.Does take omega-3 fish oil supplement high EPA relation DHA significant positive effect depressive symptom among HIV-seropositive pregnant woman , compare placebo ? 2 . Is change depressive symptom level among study participant related change omega-3 fatty acid status intervention omega-3 fish oil supplement placebo ? 3 . Which depressive symptom responsive omega-3 fish oil supplement intervention ? Study setting : The study conduct health facility Nairobi , Kenya . According late Kenya national population housing census result 2009 , [ 30 ] , Nairobi , capital city Kenya , populate city country 3.1 million people ( 1.6 million male 1.5 million female ) annual growth rate 4.1 % [ 16 ] . The available sentinel survey data indicate prevalence HIV/AIDS among pregnant woman Nairobi 10.1 % [ 31 ] 2006 . Methodology : This double-blind , parallel randomize control trial ( RCT ) use omega-3 fish oil supplement placebo . Both study participant research administrator , include principle investigator , know difference omega-3 supplement placebo similar physical characteristic . Participants recruit purposely sample health facility high attendance Prevention-of Mother-to-Child-Transmission ( PMTCT ) HIV AIDS program . The sampling frame consist pregnant woman know HIV-seropositive status enrol PMTCT program health facility . A total 200 woman meet study inclusion exclusion criterion enrol participate study . Data Collection : Quantitative method use collect socio-demographic information , dietary intake data , depressive symptom , biological specimen cheek cell , maternal weight , CD4 count , blood pressure compliance routine medication study intervention . The primary measurement tool efficacy omega-3 fish oil Beck Depression Inventory , Second Edition ( BDI-II ) score scale cut-off score depression 14 . Further understanding depression pregnancy HIV/AIDS condition gain qualitative method . Cheek cell sample collect mouth wash method laboratory extraction lipids omega-3 analysis . The lipid extract cheek cell use Bligh Dyer methodology [ 32 ] . Gas-liquid chromatography method Gibson Kneebone [ 33 ] use determine per cent ( % ) level omega-3 fatty acid lipid , intervention .</detailed_description>
