	<brief_title>Alcohol 's Impact Inflammatory Markers HIV Disease - Russia ARCH Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heavy alcohol consumption HIV-infected person may accelerate HIV disease progression end organ disease one lead explanatory pathway via enhanced microbial translocation inflammation/altered coagulation . Heavy alcohol consumption HIV infection cause microbial translocation , process bacterial product leak across gastrointestinal membrane resultant destructive immune activation . Among HIV-infected people , high level microbial translocation ( measure soluble CD14 ) inflammation/altered coagulation ( measure IL-6 D-dimer ) associate increase risk death . Of importance , among HIV-infected person , heavy drinking also significantly associate high level D-dimer cross-sectional study . Of note , initiation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) associate reduction D-dimer level . Yet follow know : longitudinal relationship alcohol consumption biomarkers independent ART ? Thus , part Uganda , Russia , Boston Alcohol Network Alcohol Research Collaboration HIV/AIDS ( URBAN ARCH ) Consortium , investigator seek create Russia ARCH cohort ( n=375 ) participant recently complete NIAAA-funded randomized control trial ( RCT ) HIV infect Russian heavy drinker . The investigator collect blood participant baseline , 12- 24-months post enrollment . In addition collect store blood sample investigator administer survey participant 3 timepoints . The investigator conduct phone interview participant 6- 18-months post enrollment . The investigator conduct laboratory test store sample , include measure microbial translocation ( sCD14 ) inflammation/altered coagulation ( IL-6/D-dimer ) PEth . This study clarify association alcohol key biomarkers time HIV-infected heavy drinker . In addition , investigator collect store blood sample participant study use analysis specify future study look HIV-infected heavy drinker .</detailed_description>
