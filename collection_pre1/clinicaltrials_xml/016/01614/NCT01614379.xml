	<detailed_description>NON-ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY OF DIABETIC ISCHEMIC LOWER LIMBS BACKGROUND Diabetic foot ulcer often progress many year diabetes patient system damage normal heel ulcer happen . The patient seek doctor send patient ulcer clinic ulcer specialist . The physician clinic examines foot , measure circulation sensitivity . The measure blood pressure comparison foot upper arm oxygen level foot . The measurement direct connection blood circulation , n't visualize blood circulation . Visualization circulation often achieve medical image method x-ray MR . The problem current use method add use contrast agent . This especially problem diabetic reduce kidney function , method poisonous kidney . That method often use right schedule amputation , surgeon plan amputation . Development MR method without use contrast agent become good image blood vein use treatment . This mean MR image provide important information patient vessel wall stiffness blood circulation without use damaging substance . Hence physician perform MR examination comparison test perform clinic make improve without risk diagnose . Using MR lot earlier stage treatment expect reduce number amputation . This economic advantage , also improvement patient quality life . The use MR technique furthermore provide physician possibility create 3D model foot , segmentation different type tissue foot . This make single MR scan provide physician important information physiology ( foot work ) , placement ulcer , shape , depth tissue contribution . INVESTIGATOR , SPONSOR AND TRAIL SETTING Michael Vaeggemose investigator perform conventional test Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital , Nørreborgade 44 , 8000 Aarhus , Denmark . Furthermore Michael perform MR scan MR Centre , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby , 8200 Aarhus N , Denmark . The blood test include project perform laboratory technician Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine . The test use determine blood glucose ( sugar level blood ) destroy examination . There establish biological bank project . Physician Niels Ejskjaer Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine attach project responsible physician . Niels Ejskjaer furthermore work supervisor investigator sponsor research project . OBJECTIVE The objective study investigate type 1 diabetic oxygen level , vessel wall stiffness , blood circulation , tissue contribution blood pressure foot use conventional measurement treatment add use MR method . METHODS The study investigation MR method treatment diabetic foot ulcer . The trial consist 5 physiological examination blood test . To make sure test subject ( diabetic healthy control ) receive treatment test perform investigator , exception blood test perform laboratory technician . The 4 test know diabetic patient earlier clinical trial perform relation treatment ulcer , ala perform . Due logistics participant experience one day trail , since MR clinical Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine place part town . The blood test use determine subject ' blood glucose ( level sugar blood ) use destroy . Blood glucose level give well-defined measure diabetes . Therefore important measure comparison conventional test MR imaging . Do blood glucose level correlate finding 5 test result statistic plausible significant result accept . Tree test make regard pulse foot . The pulse measure several place place finger one blood vein foot count number pulse ripple minute . This simple measurement effective estimate condition circulation foot . The trail include advanced method measure pulse ankle , middle foot toe compare pressure arm give indication reduce circulation specific area . The measurement perform ultrasound pressure sensitive sensor place pulsate vein . The fourth examination measure oxygen level foot . Diabetics foot ulcer often reduce oxygen level foot , make heel slow troublesome . This make oxygen level important measure measure device connect patient electrode . The first 4 measurement conventional measurement use perform clinic normal treatment ulcer . The MR measurement use determine anatomy function foot . De different scan sequence make possible visualize blood vessel , tissue contribution , oxygen level data processing vessel wall stiffness . Several scan sequence record synchrony heart rhythm . The rhythm record wireless ECG device place 3 electrode . The scan time vary , due subject different heart rate practice mean MR scan take 30 min 60 min . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sensitivity specificity MR method evaluate I relationship conventional apply method ( pulse oxygen level measurement ) perform Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine . From McNemar 's test significant level 5 % power calculation perform give need sample size 40 type-1 diabetic patient 10 healthy control subject . To perform statistical calculation assumption sensitivity specificity make . Due assumption pilot study perform 5 diabetic patient show MR method produce enough signal make need examination . VOLUNTEERS The trail consist 10 healthy ( n't use prescribed medicine ) 40 type-1 diabetic foot ulcer patient . Subjects group least 18years old receive oral write information regard project afterward give informed consent participation project . Furthermore requirement diabetic foot ulcer ulcer must reduce oxygen level . Subjects exclude metal body schedule amputation part treatment . SIDE EFFECTS , RISK AND DISADVANTAGES Oxygen level pulse examination meet requirement patient safety use large number examination . There known risk use method unpleasantness problem regard participation patient must contact investigator . MR scan also connect known risk patient ear protect soundproof earplug headphone avoid discomfort relation high sound scanner make scan . The patient place outside scanner , foot stick scanner , remove risk make patient feel claustrophobic . The blood test connect slight discomfort small risk develop accumulation blood infection needle injection site . If sign infection ( rash , heating , tenderness , swell ) subject must seek investigator emergency room . Det combine blood loss connection blood test exceed 250ml , lot less blood donation include . The blood test analyse destroy . A biobank establish project . ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Expenses connection project cover involved department . The researcher economic conflict interest project . Transport expense connection oral information examination refund regard guideline use department . In regard national guideline subject pay compensation partition project . PUBLICATION OF RESULTS The result publish recognized international paper regardless result positive , negative method good enough determine statistical significant difference . Do subject wish information project result inform investigator send information interested subject . NATIONAL ETHICAL COMMITTEE REVIEW The project report approved Danish Data Protection Agency ( nr . 2007-58-0010 ) , Danish National Committee Health Research Ethics ( nr . 2012-33818 ) department legislation . VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT Diabetic subject foot ulcer ask interest participate study , visit clinic connection regular treatment clinic . Staff physician Niels Ejskjaer treat large part patient visit clinic ask patient participation , stretch 's voluntary effect regular treatment . If patient agree participate he/she receive information project information participation research project ( Forsøgspersonernes rettigheder et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt ) write Danish National Committee Health Research Ethics . Latest week receive information investigator Michael Vaeggemose contact subject ask he/she still wish participate would like hear aspect project . Furthermore patient invite personal conversation possibility trust friend room help patient choice participate project . The healthy control subject recruit poster call participant contact investigator phone mail . The poster information project information phone invitation personal conversation trust friend offer , diabetic patient . The conversation ( diabetic control ) hold undisturbed one department room . At conversation stretch participate volunteer volunteer choose stop participation point project , without effect follow treatment . During conversation patient give write consent document must sign trail begin . The patient week evaluate project point receive call investigator regard final decision participate project .</detailed_description>
