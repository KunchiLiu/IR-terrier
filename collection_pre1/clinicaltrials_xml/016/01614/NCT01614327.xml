These subject enrol two parallel collaborator , Extension Community Healthcare Outcomes ( Project ECHO ) CommuniCare Health Centers . Each clinic obtain approximately 50 % case per year average 50 case per week . Subjects identify clinic , CommuniCare Health Centers San Antonio , TX Project ECHO , New Mexico . CommuniCare two associate site , Barrio Family Health Center Southeast San Antonio , TX Dr. Frank Bryant Health Center also San Antonio . CommuniCare serve approximately 45,000 subject year estimate 5000 require diabetic care . Project ECHO conjunction University New Mexico collaborate 20 rural clinic New Mexico provide service underserved area New Mexico . A recruitment flyer consent form provide site . Clinic staff recruit subject study schedule visit . Subject give flyer contain information study inform consent document . Subjects interested enrol study refer photographer within site Retinal imaging . Subjects receive payment stipend participation study . There screen requirement subject participate trial . Subjects must diagnose person pre-diabetes diabetes medical professional . There requirement solicitation information regard prior concomitant therapy . There criterion set forth subject exit discontinue study retinal screening perform . Subjects withdraw study retinal screening occur . Once subject completes retinal screening , period subject participation conclude . Images take subject may use study due inadequate image quality . The number image find inadequate track report completion study . Retinal screen mark begin end subject participation study . For eye , minimum two posterior pole image collect . One image center fovea second optic disc . A third image collect anterior segment ( front eye ) . Subjects pharmacologically dilate . Imaging rely natural dilation due adaptation darkness image room . More two image per eye collect imager ( photographer ) identifies give image insufficient quality reading . Poor quality image typically due physiological reason , blink small pupil use part study . The retinal photographer attempt 3 time acquire image subject 's eye order complete imaging protocol . The study coordinator conduct weekly audit image procedure order ensure document compliance study protocol . The Class II Medical Device use study non mydriatic equivalent retinal camera . The retinal camera intend use take digital image retina human eye without use pharmacological dilation . The retinal camera follow photography mode : RGB color . A Digital Camera mount retinal camera perform retinal imaging . A picture archival communication system ( PACS ) use receive DICOM image , schedule information textual report , organize store internal format , make information available across network via HIPAA FDA-cleared secure user interface . The PACS comprise capture component , central server component , viewer component use general purpose compute hardware . Subject information , procedure information , image acquisition data capture , send server alternatively , accept directly DICOM compliant device . After receive image object associate data , server register incoming data image archive include association prior case . The case present user correct permission work list control manage user . The image data transmit rendered user 's workstation use standard web browser . Once server register report , report available refer physician client service electronically via fax . Immediately image Subject demographic collect , photographer upload data case PACS via VPN connection establish image workstation PACS . If VPN connection establish time imaging , upload do late time , e.g . end clinic day . The data reside image workstation five day order assure upload . The clinical coordinator conduct weekly audit upload completion . Once PACS , case read reader use built reading template generates report finding . The study disrupt standard care study subject . Each site follow standard procedure care . Findings report clinic refer subject screening . Clinics responsible follow-up care include necessary intervention therapy . Performance RiskAnalyzer : The performance RiskAnalyzer calculate apply minimally acceptable value sensitivity ( Seo ) specificity ( Spo ) value specify advance . For purpose study , specify null hypothesis value Seo=0.85 Spo=0.70 . These value base data obtain ophthalmic exam . The efficacy train reader use retinal photography demonstrate provide sensitive screen monitoring test sight-threatening retinopathy , sensitivity &gt; 80 % . Abramoff , et al . discuss limit sensitivity achieve system give fallibility ground truth base multiple human reader . He suggest 0.85 limit sensitivity one achieve . The specificity base efficiency seek order make implementation commercially viable . We design study achieve 0.90 statistical power 0.99 significance level . If confidence limit base asymptotic normal distribution theory , sample size base asymptotic variance formula , give Pepe . Objective One : Objective one test fully study data flow logistics information transfer interface . The test do entirely one recruitment , enrollment image site . The duration time complete objective three month . Materials Research Design Objective One : Subjects recruit single site . All image rout two reader grade . If two reader assign equivalent grade image , generate report give clinic distribute refer physician . For case reader assign different grade image , image rout adjudicator resolution . The adjudicator access report generate reader , risk level RiskAnalyzer . A report adjudicator generate report clinic responsible distribute report Subject follow-up . Images also de-identified routed RiskAnalyzer . The RiskAnalyzer perform analysis image generate risk stratification either `` Low risk '' `` High risk '' diabetic retinopathy . A report contain risk level assign RiskAnalyzer distribute refer physician , clinic adjudicator use statistical analysis support endpoints trial . Outcomes Objective One : Data outcome demonstrate ability recruit enroll subject study single site , perform retinal imaging , upload image PACS , image grade two different reader , necessary rout graded adjudicator ability generate final report . The reading process follow reader base International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale . Additionally data demonstrate image successfully rout RiskAnalyzer processing . Objective Two : Objective two evaluate efficacy RiskAnalyzer identify risk Diabetic Retinopathy comparison gold standard . The duration time complete objective nine month . Methods Research Design Objective Two : Subjects recruit multiple CommuniCare Project ECHO site . All image grade two reader adjudicator grade first second reader agreement . The reading process follow reader base International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale . A consensus report generate reader adjudicator indicate presence severity diabetic retinopathy give Subject refer physician refer specialist necessary refer physician . The image grade reader also rout RiskAnalyzer process generate risk level either `` Low risk '' `` High risk '' diabetic retinopathy . As image rout RiskAnalyzer , image de-identified sequestered evaluate RiskAnalyzer . Risk level obtain use RiskAnalyzer give Subject circumstance . The refer physician also mask risk level assign RiskAnalyzer . Referring physician co-located VisionQuest Biomedical therefore access computer data storage area data . Outcomes Objective Two : Statistical analysis indicate accuracy level RiskAnalyzer compare gold standard . Statistical analysis use sensitivity , specificity , AUC , level agreement use Cohen 's kappa coefficient . Objective Three : Objective three address primary endpoint trial demonstrate reader 's accuracy grading image enhance risk level algorithm make available reader perform grade image . The duration time complete objective 12 month . Methods Research Design Objective Three : The RiskAnalyzer use first reader . There continue two human reader adjudicator . Ground Truth establish either agreement reader one reader two adjudicator . All image rout RiskAnalyzer generate risk level either `` Low risk '' `` High risk '' diabetic retinopathy . The case divide two set rout reader . One set image rout reader algorithm assign risk level set image rout reader without algorithm assign risk level . An equivalent number 'Low risk '' `` High risk '' case select set image . Ground Truth establish two reader assign grade image . When different grade assign image two different reader , case rout adjudicator grade reporting . The adjudication become ground truth . The case adjudicate different category risk stage . Adjudication base clinical significance disagreement reader follow : case within severity scale 0 1 classify `` Low Risk '' case , case within severity scale 2 classify `` High Risk '' case . Cases need adjudication differ risk within High Risk Category differ scale 2 3 ( mild severe ) , 2 4 ( mild proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy -PDR ) . Outcomes Objective Three : The outcome objective three establish RiskAnalyzer improve read accuracy consistency reader decrease bias human reader . Statistical Analysis level agreement perform risk assign image reader risk level assign algorithm use Cohen 's kappa coefficient . Expected outcome : Telemedicine retinal screening conjunction risk level RiskAnalyzer improve accuracy reader grade image . The use risk level assign RiskAnalyzer assist reader decrease amount time reader dedicate grade case . This may model support increase access retinal screening , support compliance retinal screening recommendation facilitate efficient use retinal specialist evaluate treat disease lead cost efficient method care .</detailed_description>
