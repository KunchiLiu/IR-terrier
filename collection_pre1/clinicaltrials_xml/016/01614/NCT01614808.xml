	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers Urine Samples From Younger Patients With Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize urinary metabolite signature 10 stage III , favorable-histology , Wilms tumor patient Cooperative Human Tissue Network ( CHTN ) Databank , distinct 10 normal control . II . To characterize compare urinary metabolite profile 50 randomly select , stage III , favorable-histology , Wilms tumor patient enrich additional 30 stage III Wilms tumor patient relapse . III . To establish potential poor outcome ( define relapse ) favorable-histology group specific metabolite signature . IV . To characterize urinary metabolite signature Wilms tumor patient unfavorable histology ( diffuse anaplasia ) compare favorable histology . OUTLINE : Archived urine sample analyze specific metabolite pattern nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy principal component analysis ( PCA ) . Tumor tissue may also examine NMR PCA .</detailed_description>
