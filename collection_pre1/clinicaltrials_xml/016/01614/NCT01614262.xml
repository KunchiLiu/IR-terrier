	<brief_summary>Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) technology advanced treatment people diabetes , however date technology primarily limit use patient treated insulin . CGM powerful tool potential enhance care patient treat agent insulin ; however test . The purpose study determine whether improved glycemic control achieve use intensive , periodic CGM monitoring patient T2DM treat oral anti-hyperglycemic drug ( OADs ) . The data gather pilot study utilized determine large , clinical effectiveness study ass use CGM improve clinical outcome patient T2DM treat OADs warrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining The Role CGM T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll follow 90 participant 187 day two site . Participants randomize ( 1:1 allocation ratio ) CGM base intervention ( Group 1 ) SMBG base intervention ( Group 2 ) . Group 1 receive care base upon result CGM data group 2 receive care base upon traditional self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG value ) . The clinical management algorithm utilize guide care subject . All study participant receive iPro 2 device ( Medtronic Minimed , Northridge , CA 91325 ) collect glucose measurement five 1 week period begin Day 0 , Day 45 , Day 90 , Day 135 Day 180 . Laboratory measure glucose control ( HbA1c FPG ) quality life outcome evaluate Day 0 , Day 90 Day 187 . The iPro2 device FDA approve sale US commercial product . The iPro2 digital recorder intend continuously record interstitial glucose level person diabetes mellitus . The iPro 2 intend worn intermittent period uncover glycemic variability pattern . The data obtain used maximum treatment strategy improve patient outcome . The advantage iPro 2 blind influenced patient . The Enlite sensor , investigational device , 6 day sensor . The subject study wear Enlite sensor 6 day monitoring period . The Enlite sensor CE-marked available sale 50 country currently seek FDA approval . CareLink iPro Clinical Therapy Management Software part iPro2 CGM system . The Carelink iPro Clinical Software intend support clinical trial . This internet base software allow data view easily evaluate physician . A PC link Carelink iPro Clinical via Internet allow user upload data Medtronic Diabetes iPro2 device . Because algorithm propose protocol program Software , investigational product . Adult individual 18-70 year age , diagnose T2DM currently treat Principal Investigators refer physician practice HbA1c 7.5-9.0 % .</detailed_description>
