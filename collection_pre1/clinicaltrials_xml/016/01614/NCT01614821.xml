	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug , PCI-32765 , learn whether PCI-32765 work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean PCI-32765 still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , PCI-32765 effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA yet approve PCI-32765 use patient , include people Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia . PCI-32765 newly discover drug develop anti-cancer agent . PCI-32765 Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) inhibitor drug interrupt B cell receptor ( BCR ) signal lymphomas selectively irreversibly bind Btk protein , result malignant cell death . This drug use laboratory experiment research study B-cell malignancy information research study suggest PCI-32765 may treatment strategy B-cell malignancy , include Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia . In research study , investigator test safety efficacy PCI-32765 treatment option relapse refractory Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib ( PCI-32765 ) Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients research study receive 26 cycle treatment . Each treatment cycle last 4 week . Patients take PCI-32765 mouth , day morning . During cycle patient ask visit clinic schedule test exams receive supply PCI-32765 take home every day . Patients visit clinic first day first 3 cycle , begin every three cycle . During study visit , patient physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . Patients blood test see disease respond study treatment tolerate study drug . Patients may also CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis well bone marrow aspirate biopsy . If patient 's disease stay help , he/she continue get study treatment . If disease worsens , he/she take study treatment time . After completion treatment part standard care , follow-up test include physical exam , review symptom medication , blood test , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis . The investigator would like continue monitor progress following-up every three month two year completion study .</detailed_description>
