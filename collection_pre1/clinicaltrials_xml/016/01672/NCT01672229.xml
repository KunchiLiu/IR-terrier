	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether bortezomib control immune system use treat GVHD . Bortezomib use many serious side effect patient multiple myeloma undergo transplant also acute graft versus host disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Patients With Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone marrow transplantation offer great promise treatment variety disease , particularly hematological malignancy . The incidence acute GVHD significantly decrease due significant improvement human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match donor recipient , efficient GVHD prophylaxis regimen use reduced-intensity preparative regimen . However , cGVHD remain significant cause increase morbidity mortality associate allogeneic stem cell transplantation . While many patient cGVHD respond initially high dos steroid , cGVHD usually relapse follow steroid taper . Because significant impact steroid patient population , urgent need medication take place high dose steroid use patient population . We hypothesize bortezomib modulate immune system use treat GVHD . At time bortezomib post transplant induce graft versus leukemia lymphoma effect . Bortezomib use minimal toxicity post transplant setting patient aggressive multiple myeloma also acute graft versus host disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Voluntary write informed consent Female subject either postmenopausal least 1 year screen visit , surgically sterilize childbearing potential , agree practice 2 effective method contraception time sign informed consent form 30 day last dose bortezomib , agree completely abstain heterosexual intercourse . Male subject , even surgically sterilize must agree 2 effective method contraception . Patients chronic GVHD involve 3 organ score 2 great single organ base NIH cGVHD grade Any previous treatment cGVHD ( except study drug ) . Participants may receive study drug reason besides cGVHD leukemia solid tumor . Except steroid refractory intolerant case , participant must receive baseline systemic glucocorticoid therapy cGVHD study entry . The dose steroid must stable 14 day prior start study drug . At time trial enrollment , participant may receive one two immunosuppressive therapy addition glucocorticoid . Chronic GVHD manifestation follow physical laboratory exam . Age &gt; 18 year old ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Patients ECOG performance status 3 ( define capable limited selfcare , confine bed chair 50 % waking hour ) also eligible low performance status judge directly relate steroid and/or cGVHD effect . Myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant . Patients irreversible damage manifestation chronic GVHD ( irreversible contracture sicca syndrome ) Active uncontrolled infection Contraindications administration bortezomib Relapsed disease development malignancy Laboratory parameter : ANC &lt; 1 x 10^9/L Platelets &lt; 50 x 10^9/L Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) clearly relate GVHD .

Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000 within 5 day enrollment . Patient &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Patient myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen must document investigator medically relevant . Patient hypersensitivity bortezomib , boron , mannitol . Female subject pregnant lactating . Female patient lactate positive serum pregnancy test screening period , positive urine pregnancy test Day 1 first dose study drug , applicable . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . Participation clinical trial investigational agent include trial , within 14 day start trial throughout duration trial . Radiation therapy within 3 week randomization . Enrollment subject require concurrent radiotherapy ( must localize field size ) defer radiotherapy complete 3 week elapse since last date therapy .</criteria>
