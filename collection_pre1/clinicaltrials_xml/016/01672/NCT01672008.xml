	<brief_title>NOX-100 Preventing Hypotension During Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-stage , prospective , randomize , double-blind , multi-dose , placebo-controlled , cross-over , phase IIa study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy profile NOX-100 reduce number intradialytic hypotension episode . At single-blind stage I , eligible subject receive 1-week run-in period follow 1-week NOX-100 treatment dose 0.4mg/kg/hr . To evaluate clearance NOX-100 , plasma level NOX-100 end 1st dialysis prior 2nd dialysis measure . An interim analysis undertaken completion first stage . The following process conduct plasma level NOX-100 decrease 90 % patient safety data review medical monitor . At double blind stage II , patient randomize one follow treatment sequence 1:1 ratio . - Sequence A : NOX-100 treatment phase follow Placebo treatment phase - Sequence B : Placebo treatment phase follow NOX-100 treatment phase After 1-week placebo , subject receive two 4-week treatment ( sequence A sequence B ) separate 1-week wash-out . In NOX-100 treatment phase , subject subsequently receive NOX-100 dose 1.2 , 2.5 , 5 , 10 mg/kg/hr first three dialysis session week . In placebo treatment phase , subject receive comparative placebo four week . For first 20 subject , treatment dose could escalate individual safety data review unblinded medical monitor . To confirm hepatic metabolism NOX-100 dialysis session , pre-dialysis plasma level test 2nd dialysis Week 2 , 5 , 7 10 second stage . In stage , blood pressure measure pre-HD , every 30 minute HD post-HD monitoring hypotension episode . For safety assessment , AE ( ) , SAE ( ) signs/symptoms HD record . The safety study drug follow 4 week last treatment . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) establish prior start trial DSMB meeting hold every 6~12 month study period . Both medical monitor DSMB responsible safeguarding interest trial participant .</detailed_description>
