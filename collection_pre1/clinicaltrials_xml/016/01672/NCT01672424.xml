	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The volume gastric content high protein drink versus ice chip measure ultrasound 20 minute interval two hour labor parturient . Specific Aim : To determine volume gastric content various time interval ( every 20 minute 2 hour ) patient epidural give high protein drink versus give ice chip , ultrasound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since 1940s woman restriction oral intake labor . This idea first introduce Mendelson , raise awareness relationship oral intake labor risk aspiration acidic gastric content general anesthesia need . The aspiration gastric content could potentially result severe maternal morbidity mortality . As result , woman labor receive analgesia typically restricted ice chip order prevent aspiration rare case may require general anesthesia emergent stat cesarean section . However , recent literature report actual risk aspiration labor extremely low . The risk aspiration minimize due improve general anesthetic technique involve use non-particulate antacid neutralize gastric acidity rapid sequence induction quickly secure patient airway . Many country lenient policy NPO status labor , include Netherlands United Kingdom , allow solid food intake period . The policy `` nothing mouth '' labor relationship aspiration gastric content explore Mendelson . He experiment rabbit explore effect gastric content lung . The rabbit die aspirated material contain hydrochloric acid , death due aspiration fluid neutral pH . Therefore , oral intake labor permit , ideal characteristic would substance liquid form , isotonic , normothermic , pH 7.4 , low residue . Labor compare continuous moderate aerobic exercise woman experience state accelerate starvation . This state starvation result production ketone alternative source energy . There much debate whether production harmful mother fetus . A study do Kubli 2002 evaluate effect isotonic sport drink production ketone . The drink decrease ketosis prove benefit regard labor outcome ( i.e . length labor , spontaneous delivery rate ) . It important note isotonic sport drink contain significant amount protein . It common many woman labor experience nausea emesis . Protein intake labor may beneficial effect prevention nausea emesis . The feeling nausea experience stomach muscle contract irregularly protein show re-establish normal , steady , slow rhythm . Protein believe decrease incidence nausea decrease so-called gastric arrhythmia carbohydrate meal ( i.e . non-beneficial effect isotonic sport drink ) . It also show high protein intake decrease nausea emesis patient receive cancer chemotherapy . Furthermore , determined administration protein-rich intake prevents nausea whether give 5 minute 45 minute prior nauseate stimulus ( i.e . cancer chemotherapy ) . It traditionally think gastric empty pregnancy delay relate change hormone progesterone well increased abdominal pressure gastrum . Perlas et al . determine bedside ultrasonography useful non invasive tool determine gastric content volume gastric antrum view best view determine gastric volume . In study 18 healthy volunteer , complete cross sectional view antrum obtain 100 % time , find correlation coefficient 0.86 right lateral decubitus position . However , study perform pregnant woman . Wong colleague do several gastric empty study ingestion water use ultrasound obese non-obese non-laboring parturients . In study term non labor woman , find gastric empty half time shorter ( 24 min vs. 33 min ) ingestion 300 ml water 50 ml water . In term obese pregnant woman , find significant difference gastric empty ingestion 300 ml v 50 ml . In effect , water study back baseline level 60 min post ingestion . We unaware gastric emptying time protein solution pregnant woman . Barret et al . determine complete gastric empty protein solution take approximately 2 hour compare 1 hour glucose solution , 3 hour solid meal healthy non pregnant adult . As follow protein study ( PRO10070074 ) , plan evaluate gastric empty protein drink ice chip use ultrasound determine gastric volume describe .</detailed_description>
