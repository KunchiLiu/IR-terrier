	<brief_title>BRCA1-associated DNA Repair Dysfunction Patients With Early Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant Platinum-based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent gene expression profile breast cancer identify specific subtypes clinical , biologic , therapeutic implication . The basal-like group tumor associate aggressive behavior poor prognosis , typically express hormone receptor HER-2 ( `` triple-negative '' phenotype ) . Therefore , patient basal-like cancer benefit currently available target systemic therapy . There lot evidence link basal-like breast cancer BRCA1 deficiency . Many clinical characteristic molecular feature share basal-like breast cancer tumor arise carrier BRCA1 germline mutation . Some study indicate BRCA1 mRNA expression lower basal-like sporadic cancer control match age grade . BRCA1 rarely mutate sporadic breast cancer , therefore , believe may result epigenetic mechanism acquire methylation BRCA1 gene promoter dysfunction pathway regulate BRCA1 expression , overexpression ID4 . The profound similarities hereditary BRCA1-related breast tumor basal-like tumor strongly implicate fundamental defect BRCA1 associate DNA-repair pathway ( p53 , PTEN ) sporadic basal-like tumor . There increase evidence BRCA1-related DNA-repair defect , especially defective homologous recombination , determine sensitivity certain agent , platinum salts-based chemotherapy . The complexity downregulation BRCA1 expression suggest approach may effective treatment subset sporadic basal-like cancer . Identification specific marker cancer essential translate understand defective DNA repair target treatment poor prognosis subtype .</detailed_description>
