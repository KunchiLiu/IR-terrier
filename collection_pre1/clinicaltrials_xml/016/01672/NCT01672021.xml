	<brief_title>Initial Assessment 18FDG-PET/MRIin Determining Extent Systemic Disease Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study initial assessment ability 18FDG-PET/MR imaging detect systemic disease breast cancer patient compare conventional 18FDG-PET/CT . Rationale : Accurate assessment extent systemic disease breast cancer patient initially throughout treatment surveillance comprise basis clinical care include surgical planning , radiation drug selection . Shortcomings FDG-PET/CT , common current method disease detection surveillance , include decreased sensitivity brain , liver bone relatively high radiation dose , could cause 5 new cancer per 1,000 patient ( young American woman ) per scan . Initial study assess whole body MRI , technique involve radiation , stag breast cancer patient show promise , suffer decreased ability detect nodal disease detection false positive lesion . Manual fusion PET MRI data bowel breast organ system show decrease false positive lesion compare MRI alone . In past year , molecular MRI image machine combine PET MRI image become available research purpose . Hypothesis 1 : We therefore hypothesize FDG-PET/MRI provide concordant improve lesion detection compare FDG-PET/CT breast cancer patient decrease radiation dose . Hypothesis 2 : In addition , simultaneously acquire PET MRI data allows analysis local tumor characteristic include perfusion , cellularity glucose metabolism . In subgroup patient index breast cancer , hypothesize local tumor metric correlate number site systemic lesion . Methods : All newly diagnose breast cancer patient undergo image evaluation initial extent disease disease surveillance NYU Cancer Center Bellevue hospital candidate study protocol . Patients invited follow-up FDG-PET/MRI imaging time undergo FDG-PET/CT part clinical care . Subjects undergoing FDG-PET/CT Cancer Center 34th St Lexington Avenue part routine care transfer directly 38th St. facility car timely manner additional dose 18-FDG label glucose unnecessary experimental FDG-PET/MRI . FDG-PET/MRI perform estimate 45-60 minute scan time . The patient free leave department . Data transfer workstation interpret two independent radiologist . Size location lesion record confidentiality protect spreadsheet component scan lesion load define union detect lesion three component ( DCE-MRI , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , FDG-PET ) . Data compare per lesion , per organ system per patient basis patient 's routine FDG-PET/CT presence metastatic disease size number metastatic lesion . In case PET/MRI demonstrate metastatic disease see routine modality , refer physician alert . Additional dedicate radiologic study biopsy may recommend perform discretion refer physician . Results : Results FDG-PET/MRI FDG-PET/CT finding report descriptive format together related biopsy result histopathologic correlation . An exact 95 % confidence interval derive true percentage time assessment disease state lesion , per organ system per patient FDG-PET/MRI concordant assessment derive patient use FDG-PET/CT . In patient index breast cancer , Pearson Spearman rank correlation use characterize association local tumor metric metastatic burden location . Potential benefit : 1 . Equal improved ability detect metastatic disease breast cancer patient decrease radiation dose . 2 . An improved understanding index tumor metric help stratify risk metastatic disease base index tumor enable individually tailor surveillance .</detailed_description>
