	<brief_summary>Background : - Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) genetic disorder lymph system . People ALPS often swell lymph node , especially neck armpit . They also much high risk develop lymphoma . It always easy determine whether swollen lymph node cause ALPS lymphoma . Researchers want see whether different image study show difference ALPS lymphoma . The study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) . Researchers use drug call fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) look lymph node . Objectives : - To see well image study distinguish swollen lymph node cause ALPS lymphoma . Eligibility : - Individuals must 5 year age old enrol National Institutes Health natural history study ALPS . - Participants either lymphoma symptom suggest possible lymphoma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants FDG-PET/CT scan . It perform accord standard procedure . - If result scan show lymphoma , participant stay study 1 year clinical follow . They may second FDG-PET/CT scan change symptom . Such change include enlargement lymph node , unexplained fever , weight loss . - If result scan show evidence new worsen lymphoma , treatment study end . Further test base clinical symptom , include lymph node biopsy , may do ALPS natural history study rule make diagnosis lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS ) inherit disorder associate defective lymphocyte apoptosis , clinically characterize prominent nonmalignant lymphadenopathy , hepatosplenomegaly , overt autoimmune disease hemolytic anemia , autoimmune thrombocytopenia , neutropenia . Additionally , ALPS patient significantly increase risk develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . The diagnosis lymphoma particularly troublesome ALPS many ALPS manifestation overlap clinical feature suggestive lymphoma . Therefore , individual ALPS may undergo repeated biopsy course disease . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combine compute tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) noninvasive test may help u discriminate benign malignant lymphadenopathy patient ALPS . For patient ALPS clinical symptom suggestive lymphoma , sudden increase focal lymphadenopathy and/or systemic B symptom associate lymphoma , want investigate whether FDG-PET/CT useful determining plan action assist locate active lymph node determine whether surgical biopsy warrant . Under protocol , FDG-PET/CT scan do rule lymphoma . A lymph node biopsy may necessary determine pathology lymph node do research purpose alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To qualify enrollment , patient must meet following : 1 . Fulfill current criterion diagnosis ALPS , include document chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly , either great equal 1.5 % Tcell receptor alpha/beta+ DNTs peripheral blood confirm RAS mutation without elevate alpha/beta DNTs . 2 . Be enrol ALPS natural history protocol # 93I0063 . 3 . Have 1 following : 1 . Sudden enlargement least 1 lymph node group lymph node baseline . 2 . Systemic symptom suspicious lymphoma ( i.e. , loss weight , loss appetite , fatigue , night sweat , fever , pruritus ) . 3 . A histologically proven diagnosis lymphoma malignancy . 4 . Be 5 year age old . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude follow present : 1 . Concurrent proven infection inflammatory disease ( e.g. , sarcoidosis ) , often show increase FDG uptake PET could interfere interpretation study result . 2 . Hyperglycemia ( regardless etiology ) determine fast glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL 3 . Weight excess 400 lb , exceed weight limit scanner table . 4 . Pregnancy breastfeeding . For woman childbearing potential , negative urine serum pregnancy test require within 24 hour prior FDGPET/CT scan .</criteria>
