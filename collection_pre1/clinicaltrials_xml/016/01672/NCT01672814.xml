	<brief_title>Microwave Treatment Corneal Collagen Crosslinking Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare safety efficacy Vedera KXS ( microwave-based procedure ) combine corneal collagen cross-linking perform VibeX ( Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution ) KXL System corneal collagen cross-link alone reduce corneal curvature patient keratoconus . Patients randomize one two treatment group : Vedera KXS combine corneal collagen cross-linking collagen cross-linking alone . The Vedera KXS procedure performs control application microwave energy annular configuration . The goal procedure reshape cornea flatten cornea improve corneal topography patient keratoconus . The primary goal collagen crosslinking stabilize corneal shape keratoconus prevent progression disease . Moreover , investigation crosslinking show procedure decrease keratoconus progression , also decrease steepness cone improve uncorrected best correct visual acuity case . Since mechanism improvement differs procedure , study compare combine microwave/crosslinking treatment crosslinking alone .</detailed_description>

A history delay epithelial heal eye treat Patients nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze treatment diagnostic test Patients current condition , investigator 's opinion , would interfere prolong epithelial healing Taking Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) supplement within 1 week crosslinking treatment A history previous corneal crosslinking treatment eye treat Have use investigational drug device within 30 day study concurrently enrol another investigational drug device study within 30 day study</criteria>
