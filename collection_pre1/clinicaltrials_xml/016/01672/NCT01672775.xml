	<criteria>Dose determination cohort : Histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic RCC either clear cell nonclear histology . Tumors clear cell histology : subject must progress least one antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( antiVEGFR ) therapy Tumors nonclear cell histology must ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 3 ( ENPP3 ) positive prescreening . This subgroup prior therapy requirement . Dose expansion cohort : Histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic RCC either clear cell papillary histology Tumors clear cell histology : subject must progress least one antiVEGFR therapy Tumors papillary histology : include unclassified histology papillary feature must ENPP3 positive prescreening . This subgroup prior therapy requirement .
