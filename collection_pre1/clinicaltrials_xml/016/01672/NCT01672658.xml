The functional benefit SK Balance system measure improvement balance functional assessment . This study primarily fund Engineering Acoustics subcontract phase II Small Business Innovation Research Department Defense . 3 ) Hypotheses &amp; Research Objectives Purpose : The specific research question address : 1 . How 8-week SKBS+VRT training intervention compare 8-week standard VRT intervention balance functional gait measure mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) participant . 2 . How SKBS measurement tool compare standard clinical assessment gait balance mTBI patient The purpose clinical research study compare value benefit SK multimodal balance training system combination traditional vestibular rehabilitation vs. traditional vestibular rehabilitation alone independent clinical evaluation . The functional benefit SK Balance system measure improvement clinical measure balance , functional mobility , gait assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) occur physical trauma cause temporary permanent neurological damage . In case , symptom continue time contribute disability . Dizziness vertigo associate nearly report study mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) significant functionally limit component overall disability . TBI one many risk face military personnel combat activity . In RAND Corporation survey service member deploy Iraq Afghanistan , 19 % report probable TBI . Dizziness vertigo associate nearly report study mTBI significant debilitate component overall disability . mTBI currently cause blast impact injury result variable disability . Overt symptom may include balance spatial disorientation problem ( vertigo ) relate vestibular dysfunction , vision disturbance , inner-ear edema , and/or sensory integration deficit . Treatment particular population group several challenge include : 1 ) difficulty early specific injury assessment 2 ) determination appropriate return-to-duty measure 3 ) selection effective individualized balance rehabilitation treatment tool 4 ) Prolonged length rehabilitation uncertain measureable endpoint . The group also highly variable nature extent balance deficit cognitive / related psychological impairment . It appear almost subject mTBI show susceptibility vestibular vestibular/ocular disorder . After assessment disequilibrium , rehabilitation often course remedial physical therapy ( PT ) . To affect change mobility standard physical therapy , sensory motor system `` habituate '' exercise , hope rehabilitate system `` compensating '' instruct patient alter skill set associate task . Compensation ( without immediate sensory feedback ) problematic prone patient ( caregiver ) interpretation error , may address underlie problem may long term therapeutic benefit . There also limit pool PTs specialize treatment neurological problem result brain injury . Individual vestibular rehabilitation treatment program design specialist PTs also monitor participate patient 's recovery . This approach labor intensive , time consuming ( 14 week therapy often need ) patient recover fully . The overall objective research effort use novel combination multi-modal sensory guide feedback ( especially tactile ) traditional vestibular rehabilitation retrain military personnel suffer balance disorder result mTBI . The investigator therapeutic goal test technology return patient , short period time , level balance performance consistent return community and/or military duty . The sense touch intrinsically link neuro-motor channel , reflex higher cognitive region , make uniquely tie orientation localization . Vibrotactile array therefore intuitive effective sensory feedback pathway . Recent research also demonstrate tactile cue yield significantly faster accurate performance comparable spatial auditory cue . Further research demonstrate find relatively stable across variety body orientation , even spatial translation require physiological stress . Over Phase I SBIR current Phase II effort , Engineering Acoustics Inc. develop Sensory Kinetics ( SK ) Balance System . In SK system , patient move force platform ( see Figure 1 ) movement posture data interpret advanced software map wearable vibrotactile belt array visual display . Vibrotactile cue provide continuous instantaneous feedback patient compliment postural mobility decision . The investigator believe vibrotactile feedback greatly increase spatial awareness consequently mobility . Further , ability brain re-organize relearn functional movement activity provide intriguing potential pathway retention learn functional mobility strategies.Vibrotactile cue involves short duration burst mechanical vibration actuator , tactors , mount within torso worn belt . The person 's position measure calculated use force plate sensor camera sensor . The computerized system use part physical therapy balance training improve patient 's balance potentially reduce risk fall .</detailed_description>
