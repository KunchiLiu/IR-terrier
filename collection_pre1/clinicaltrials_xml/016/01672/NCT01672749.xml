	<brief_summary>The foremost challenge manage early onset scoliosis ( curve deformity age 10 ) prevent curve progression maintain growth spine . Current treatment option require repetitive intervention spine child grow . This study compare two technique growth modulation : Standard dual grow rod versus new Luqu√© Trolley screw Hypothesis : Patients treat DePuy Synthes TROLLEY system undergo few re-operations 3 year follow-up ( FU ) patient include comparison group</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Modern System Allow Growth Children With Scoliosis Versus Conventional Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical study show growth guide construct DePuy Synthes TROLLEY Gliding Vehicles allow less re-operations ongoing spinal growth across instrumented immature spine prevent curve progression early onset scoliosis patient .</detailed_description>
