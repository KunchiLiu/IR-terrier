	<brief_summary>The purpose trial confirm presence Proxima 3 disposable arterial line n't significantly attenuate arterial pressure wave form . The principal aim trial : • To obtain quantitative data allow investigation pressure wave form obtain standard arterial line compare various arterial line fit Proxima 3 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Arterial Pressure Wave Form Through Proxima Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine transmission arterial pressure wave form Proxima 3 disposable attach configurable part patient 's arterial line . The Proxima device test Intertek part Proxima 2 project find comply BS EN 60601-1 2nd edition `` Medical electrical equipment — Part 1 : General requirement basic safety essential performance '' . Additional internal test also carry clause 51.103 , frequency response , BS EN 60601-2-34 ( 2001 ) . This study part on-going development Proxima system monitor metabolic parameter critically ill patient use disposable sensor array . This study build upon four clinical trial carry past two year Sphere Medical partnership NHS ( REC reference : 10/H1308/53 , 10/H0308/113 , 11/SW/0166 , 12/SW/0175 ) . This study form part development process Proxima family device . The Proxima 3 : - Is disposable multi-parameter microanalyser - Is connect patient 's arterial line . - Will measure blood gas , haematocrit electrolyte connect small bedside monitor , display result . - Microanalyser perform unlimited number analysis period seventy two hour . - Will use part close system , reduce infection risk prevent blood loss . Proxima 3 enable clinician measure blood parameter without leave patient 's bedside . This support ability respond rapidly change condition critically ill patient . The measurement make Proxima 3 system potential inform clinical decision support system change , fundamental level , ability clinician improve patient care . In study Proxima 3 passive component . It NOT connect Proxima 3 monitor . NO blood take NO analysis blood analyte concentration occur study .</detailed_description>
