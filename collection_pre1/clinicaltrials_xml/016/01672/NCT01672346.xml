	<brief_title>PV Reconnection After PVAI Different Power Settings Adenosine Provocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The efficiency catheter ablation drug-refractory atrial fibrillation ( AF ) compromise high incidence post-ablation AF recurrences require multiple ablation procedure ( 1 ) . Post-PVAI ( pulmonary vein antrum isolation ) AF recurrence mostly due reconnection previously isolate PVs ( 2 ) . Earlier study reveal elimination dormant PV conduction reveal adenosine-provocation ensures well outcome reconnection mostly happen due presence incompletely ablate tissue identification complete ablation decrease chance recurrence ( 1 ) . Adenosine specifically choose induction trigger know transiently permanently re-establish leave atrium-pulmonary vein ( LA-PV ) conduction apparently successful PV isolation ( 3 ) . Datino et al demonstrated canine adenosine selectively hyperpolarizes PVs increase inward rectifier potassium ( K+ ) current restores excitability ( 4 ) . As incompletely ablate tissue potentially cause AF recurrence , depth extension lesion crucial factor determine success-rate ablation ; turn directly influence catheter type radio-frequency ( RF ) energy setting ( 5 ) . In previous study , Matiello et al report cooled-tip catheter 40w set effective prevent recurrence 30w setting ( 5 ) . However , none early study examine rate PV reconnection AF ablation do different power setting use open-irrigated catheter dormant site reveal adenosine-challenge . Hypothesis : Use high wattage ablation adenosine-challenge associate low rate PV reconnection .</detailed_description>
