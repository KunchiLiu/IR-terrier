	<detailed_description>Antenatal education Today Danish antenatal class primarily offer auditorium lecture minimum interaction audience . The Danish region currently aim time implement antenatal birth parent preparation class small group expectant parent . However , unknown 1 ) antenatal preparation small group superior standard care ; 2 ) element preparation encompass meet need expectant parent today ; 3 ) cost-effectiveness antenatal preparation small group compare large-scale preparation auditorium . Trial objective purpose The primary aim compare parent resource , health thriving , use healthcare service newborn family enrol research-based standardised antenatal birth parent program small group allocate standard care . Development program : We develop comprehensive , theoretically founded parent program collaboration midwife , health care visitor , psychologist family therapist , parent , lead national international researcher clinician field . Process evaluation : Focus group interview service provider , group facilitator participant carry . Program fidelity e.g . whether protocol follow program delivery , much intend program participant receive , well program reach e.g . proportion intend group participate program , impact effect intervention . We evaluate whether protocol follow program delivery much intend program participant receive . Participants ask fill electronic questionnaire on-site end session . The questionnaire highlight whether intended subject session cover well extent participant find information give useful . Group facilitator ask fill similar questionnaire opportunity explain certain topic may omit . Non respondent/non-participation : What proportion intend group participate program explore examine demographic characteristic decline participate trial via national register , well examine characteristic accept show session . Cost-effectiveness analysis : Finally incremental societal cost intervention calculate compare measure outcomes cost-effectiveness analysis . Direct health care cost well productivity cost term labour market participation sickness absence . For use data obstetric database Hvidovre Hospital , national register questionnaire . Trial design Individually randomise trial sit large birth clinic Copenhagen Capital Region , Hvidovre Hospital . Trial intervention The intervention two arm : 1 . A research-based parenting program describe detail . 2 . Standard care ( control group ) . The pregnant woman partner offer two antenatal lecture birth breastfeed auditorium . The intervention arm : Groups approximately 6-7 couple ( mother ) meet three time pregnancy 1 time 5 week expect due date , duration 2.5 hour per session . ( The aim create group 6-7 couple ; however , due fluctuation uptake group 4-9 couple deem acceptable ) . The session include information discussion emotion expectation related birth parenting , identification social network resource , couple communication , breastfeeding , parent-child attachment , direction take care newborn , recognise common sign mood disorder react . A website parenting information exercise create parent encourage use material alongside session . In addition gain knowledge issue relate birth parenting , create environment parent discuss feeling concern , program aim enhance expectant parent ' awareness resource problem-solving strategy . Furthermore way group composited enable participant establish relation expectant parent local area . All session lead midwife . The postnatal session conduct collaboration health visitor , increase knowledge available resource local community Informed consent All participant consider trial provide write oral information trial participant make informed decision participation trial . A project phone line establish participant contact project member throughout trial question , wish withdraw consent participation trial . Data collection Data collect parent use web-based questionnaire : baseline ( approximately 18 week gestation ) ( Tp0 ) , 37 week gestation ( Tp1 ) , 9 week expect due date ( Tp2 ) , 6 month expect due date ( Tp3 ) , 1 year expect due date ( Tp4 ) . Participants contact via e-mail , due answer questionnaire . Two reminder send via additional e-mail , first week second 14 day . Data also obtain hospital obstetric database national register . Concomitant medication/treatment All participant free make use concomitant antenatal/postnatal service parent group . As use service parent group may influence outcomes interested , use service examine , document give careful consideration analysis . Explorative outcome In addition primary secondary outcome , follow explorative outcome : Post-natal depressive symptomatology anxiety - questionnaire data , EPDS ( tp0,1,2 ) Breastfeeding - questionnaire data ( tp0,1,2,3 ) Use healthcare service i.e . : parent obstetric intervention i.e . augmentation labour , vacuum extraction , caesarean rate - data hospital obstetric database ( tp2 ) , contact healthcare professional depressive symptomatology unscheduled postnatal visits- questionnaire data ( tp2,3 ) . Family medicine use - questionnaire data ( tp2,3 ) register data ( tp4 ) Smoking - questionnaire data ( tp1,2,3,4 ) Satisfaction relationship family break-ups - questionnaire data ( tp 0,1,2,3,4 ) , data national register divorce break-ups ( tp4 ) : mental well-being ( tp1,2,3,4 ) In trial intermediate outcome interest : Parenting resource : trust ability cope : 1 ) birth ( tp1 ) , 2 ) discharge ( tp1 ) 3 ) parenting ( tp1,2,4 ) breastfeeding ( tp0,1 ) ; couple communication ( tp0,1,2,3,4 ) ; social support/network ( tp0,1,2,3,4 ) Statistical plan data analysis Sample size power estimation We plan trial independent experimental control participant 1 control per experimental participant . 2011 data HH Obstetric Database ( unpublished data ) indicate epidural use among pregnant woman 31 % . If true epidural use experimental participant 25 % , need include 1,175 experimental participant 1,175 control participant able reject null hypothesis epidural use experimental control participant equal probability ( power ) 90 % . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 5 % Amendment 17th February 2014 : Due slow recruitment , reduce power 90 % 80 % , thus reduce sample size 2,350 participant 1,756 participant . Power estimation secondary outcome Perceived Stress Scale We plan trial 1175 experimental participant 1175 control participant . In previous study Perceived Stress Scale response within participant group normally distribute standard deviation 6 ( 18 ) . If true difference experimental control mean 1 , able reject null hypothesis population mean experimental control group equal probability ( power ) 98.1 % . The type 1 error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.5 . Power estimation secondary outcome Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire In previous study Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire response within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 0.5 ( 19 ) . If true difference experimental control mean 0.1 , able reject null hypothesis population mean experimental control group equal probability ( power ) 99.8 % . The type 1 error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.5 . Power estimation secondary outcome Parenting Alliance Measure In previous study Parenting Alliance Measure response within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 20 . If true difference experimental control mean 4 , able reject null hypothesis population mean experimental control group equal probability ( power ) 98.7 % . The type 1 error probability associate test null hypothesis 5 % . Statistical method Reporting follow guideline CONSORT-statement . Statistical analysis intention treat well per protocol . The level significance 0.05 . The analysis primary binary outcome do use logistic regression . The result analysis subject bad case best case scenario analysis potential impact miss value . In analysis two secondary outcome measure mixed model repeat measure use . The fixed effect include linear quadratic time component correspond interaction intervention indicator . An unstructured covariance matrix use initially . If convergence obtain spatial power law covariance structure try compound symmetric model . Using general linear univariate model test mean value differ two intervention group time 1 ( 9 week follow birth ) . If assumption analysis fulfil reasonable approximation group compare time 1 use nonparametric test ( Mann Whitney ) . The unadjusted analysis primary analysis . If possible analysis repeat adjust protocol specify stratification variable baseline value . Three explorative subgroup analysis may conduct case provide subgroup interact significantly intervention . Dealing multiplicity , gate keep use adjust observe p value primary secondary outcome . Both observe adjust p value report . Direct access source data/documentation The trial carry accordance Declaration Helsinki late form well national law regulation . The investigator permit audit inspection provide direct access source data/documentation . The trial monitor unrelated research group National Institute Public Health . eCRFs check , minimum following monitor locally : All patient existence ( If CPR number correct ) , All patient document informed consent</detailed_description>
