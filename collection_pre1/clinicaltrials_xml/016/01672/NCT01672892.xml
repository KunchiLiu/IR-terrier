	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different method radiation side effect compare well work treat endometrial cervical cancer surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Versus Intensity-Modulated Pelvic Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Endometrial Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) reduce acute gastrointestinal toxicity 5th week ( 23-25 fraction ) pelvic radiation measure expanded prostate cancer index composite ( EPIC ) instrument . Secondary - To determine grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 [ CTCAE v. 4.0 ] ) reduce IMRT compare conventional whole-pelvis radiation therapy ( WPRT ) . - To determine grade 2+ hematologic toxicity ( CTCAE v. 4.0 ) reduce IMRT compare conventional WPRT . - To determine urinary toxicity reduce IMRT use EPIC urinary domain . - To validate EPIC bowel urinary domain woman undergo either IMRT pelvic radiation treatment four-field pelvic radiation treatment endometrial cervical cancer . - To assess impact pelvic IMRT quality life use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) cervix subscale . - To determine difference local-regional control , disease-free survival , overall survival patient treat IMRT compare conventional WPRT . - To perform health-utilities analysis measure financial impact pelvic IMRT via EQ-5D instrument . - To identify molecular predictor radiation toxicity novel circulate cancer biomarkers . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type cancer ( endometrial v cervical ) , chemotherapy ( none v 5 course weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m² ) , radiation dose ( 45 Gy v 50.4 Gy ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard ( 3-dimensional ) radiation therapy 5 day week 5-6 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 5-6 week . Some patient receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment continue weekly 5 week , concurrently radiation therapy , absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Tissue blood sample may collect biomarker correlative analysis . Quality life may assess questionnaire ( include Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [ EPIC ] , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General [ FACT-G , Version 4 ] , EQ-5D , Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events - Patient-Reported Outcome [ PRO-CTCAE ] ) instrument baseline periodically study therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year annually 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Pathologically proven diagnosis endometrial cervical cancer Patients must undergo hysterectomy ( total abdominal hysterectomy , vaginal hysterectomy radical hysterectomy , total laparoscopic hysterectomy ) carcinoma cervix endometrium within 49 day prior registration Performance bilateral salpingooophorectomy treat surgeon 's discretion No positive close ( &lt; 3 mm ) resection margin Appropriate stage protocol entry , include distant metastasis , base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : History/physical examination within 45 day prior registration Computed tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) CT include abdomen pelvis perform initial radiological staging ( perform pre postsurgery within 90 day prior registration ) Imaging perform postoperatively show evidence residual disease Any evidence malignancy identify preoperative imaging completely resect surgically prior protocol treatment Chest xray chest CT must perform within 90 day prior registration ( unless PETCT perform ) Endometrial cancer : Patients follow histologic feature eligible pelvic radiation therapy without weekly cisplatin : Less 50 % myometrial invasion , grade 3 adenocarcinoma without uterine serous carcinoma ( USC ) , clear cell histology At least 50 % myometrial invasion , grade 12 adenocarcinoma without USC , clear cell histology Patients follow histologic feature may treat pelvic radiation without weekly cisplatin ( decision add weekly cisplatin patient treat physician 's discretion ) : At least 50 % myometrial invasion , grade 3 include USC clear cell carcinoma International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) 2009 stage II endometrial cancer grade include USC clear cell carcinoma FIGO 2009 stage IIIC1 ( pelvic lymph node positive , paraaortic node negative remove ) include USC clear cell carcinoma . NOTE : If paraaortic node remove , CT abdomen PET must demonstrate evidence lymphadenopathy . Cervical cancer : Patients follow pathology finding may treat pelvic radiation without weekly cisplatin treat physician 's discretion : Patients intermediaterisk feature include two follow histologic finding radical hysterectomy : 1/3 stromal invasion , lymphvascular space invasion large clinical tumor diameter ( &gt; 4 cm ) Patients cervical cancer treat simple hysterectomy negative margin Patients follow criterion follow radical hysterectomy eligible study must receive weekly cisplatin : Positive resect pelvic node paraaortic node negative remove . NOTE : If paraaortic node remove , CT abdomen PET CT must demonstrate evidence lymphadenopathy . Microscopic parametrial invasion negative margin No patient paraaortic nodal disease require extendedfield radiotherapy beyond pelvis No patient histology consist endometrial stromal sarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , malignant mixed mullerian tumor ( MMMT ) , carcinosarcoma No evidence metastatic disease outside pelvis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Zubrod performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm³ Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 8.0 g/dL ( use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dL acceptable ) For patient receive chemotherapy : Within 14 day prior registration , serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AND calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 2 time ULN Alkaline phosphatase , magnesium , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , electrolytes must obtain record Fertile patient must use effective contraception Not pregnant and/or breastfeed Willing able complete bowel urinary domain expand prostate cancer index composite ( EPIC ) instrument prior registration No patient exceed weight/size limit treatment table CT scanner No mental status change bladder control problem make patient unable comply bladderfilling instruction No prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless diseasefree minimum 3 year No patient active inflammatory bowel disease No severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration Other major medical illness require hospitalization precludes study therapy time registration Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ( however , laboratory test coagulation parameter require entry protocol ) Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ( however , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] test require entry protocol ) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics No prior radiation therapy pelvis No prior treatment platinumbased chemotherapy Patients may NOT receive amifostine protective reagent</criteria>
