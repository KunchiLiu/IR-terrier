	<brief_summary>Firefighters frequently work extended duration shift long work week adverse effect alertness , health , safety performance . This protocol use survey instrument examine effect extend duration shift safety outcome ( e.g. , motor vehicle crash , accident , injury ) , health ( e.g. , diagnosis treatment sleep disorder , improve general health index , decrease number sick day ) , performance ( e.g. , decreased response time ) . This study expand understand nature , scope , etiology consequence firefighter fatigue increase ability develop guideline generalize across fire department throughout North America . This study could provide avenue make lasting policy improvement could enhance safety , health , performance firefighter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fire Fighter Fatigue Management Program : Operation Fight Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Firefighters work challenge schedule know highly stressful demand condition . The need work frequent extend shift lead acute chronic sleep deficiency well disruption circadian rhythm . Firefighters on-call overnight also particularly susceptible sleep inertia , neurocognitive impairment experience immediately upon wake . In addition , likely significant proportion firefighter suffer undiagnosed sleep disorder , impair sleep exacerbate fatigue . The propose fatigue countermeasure aim increase sleep opportunity , thereby improve firefighter safety health . We conduct station-level , randomized clinical trial policy design maximize sleep opportunity current 24-hour shift improve alertness , performance , health safety firefighter . We leverage comprehensive fatigue management program develop web-based technology implement previous Federal Emergency Management Agency project , continue offer web-based education program sleep disorder screen . By conduct collaborative study involve sleep medicine clinician , sleep researcher , consultant alarm , together representative management , union leadership fire department , expect develop sleep optimization program high probability success test hypotheses increase sleep opportunity firefighter improve alertness , performance , safety physical mental health firefighter . The result study provide policy maker scientific evidence require develop effective fatigue countermeasure program firefighter . We conduct randomized clinical trial , provide rigorous evaluation possible operational setting . Half fire station department randomly assign complete intervention , termed Operation Fight Fatigue , first year study . The half fire station complete intervention second year . In way , firefighter chance benefit . We expect fatigue countermeasure intervention improve alertness , performance , health safety firefighter . We evaluate cost-effective intervention improve safety health firefighter department throughout United States .</detailed_description>
