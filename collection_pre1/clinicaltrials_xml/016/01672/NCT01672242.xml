	<brief_summary>Respiratory distress common problem intensive care unit . There multiple mechanism use help patient respiratory distress include mechanical ventilation , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) , high flow oxygen , oxygen supplementation nasal cannula facemask . The purpose study evaluate mechanism Vapotherm , high flow oxygen system , provide breathe support . Vapotherm provide high flow oxygen different flow rate , mean one increase amount oxygen flow help breathe support . The investigator believe high flow oxygen system may provide similar breathe support continuous positive airway pressure machine ( CPAP ) machine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment End Expiratory Lung Volumes Healthy Subjects Using High Flow Oxygen ( Vapotherm® )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy ( HFNC ) method oxygen delivery commonly use persistently hypoxic patient refractory conventional mode oxygen supplementation ( i.e . nasal cannula , facemask , non-rebreather facemask ) . Initially used neonate , increasingly popular adult population . While investigator know HFNC provide oxygen supplementation , physiologic mechanism correct hypoxemia still unclear . There five mechanism hypoxemia , four correct oxygen supplementation - decrease FiO2 , hyperventilation , V/Q mismatch , diffusion defect ; one - shunt . The hypoxemia refractory supplemental oxygen suggest presence physiologic shunt . The conventional non-invasive therapy reduce shunt fraction require raise end-expiratory lung volume raise end-expiratory airway pressure use application continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) . The Vapotherm® ( Vapotherm® , Stevensville , Maryland ) product high flow oxygen therapy ( Precision Flow® ) one investigator frequently use intensive care unit University Maryland Medical Center . It create leak proof seal nose see CPAP BiPAP . Positive pressure generation study another high flow oxygen system call Optiflow™ ( Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare , Ltd. , Auckland , New Zealand ) . However device differs Vapotherm® nasal bore large create seal naris thereby affect ventilation level PEEP generation . Additionally , study measure positive expiratory lung pressure , volume . Positive end expiratory alveolar pressure increase expiratory lung volume adults yet demonstrate use Precision Flow® . HFNC intrigue study clinical data show relatively non-invasive method oxygen delivery appear correct hypoxemia well non-invasive method . It comfortable CPAP machine thus well tolerate among patient , especially critically ill possibly alter . While use neonate time , use adult new need research . The investigator hypothesis HFNC corrects persistent hypoxemia produce increase end-expiratory lung volume thus keep alveoli open throughout respiratory cycle oxygen supplement unable . Using healthy volunteer investigator measure end expiratory lung volume HFNC compare obtain CPAP grade pressure .</detailed_description>
