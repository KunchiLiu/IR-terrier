	<detailed_description>Hypothesis # 1 To verify efficacy 8-week course cocoa-containing product consumption blood pressure adult stage 1 hypertension . Specifically , demonstrate least 3.5 mmHg improvement 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure follow 8 week treatment cocoa- containing product compare placebo . Our hypothesis cocoa-containing product consumption result clinically significant improvement systolic blood pressure conclusion 8-week course treatment . Hypothesis # 2 To identify dose-response relationship increasingly high dos cocoa powder cocoa-containing product demonstrate correspondingly great beneficial effect blood pressure 8-week period individual stage 1 hypertension . Specifically , investigate effect variation dose cocoa powder cocoa-containing product ( i.e . 5 gram 10 gram cocoa powder ) 8 week blood pressure . We hypothesize increasingly high dos cocoa powder cocoa-containing product demonstrate correspondingly great beneficial effect blood pressure . Hypothesis # 3 To assess effect different dos cocoa-containing product consumption 8-week period 24-hour diastolic blood pressure , endothelial function , arterial stiffness , serum lipid , theobromine , CRP , glucose , insulin , body weight , waist circumference adult stage 1 hypertension . We hypothesize consumption cocoa-containing product low diastolic blood pressure ; improve endothelial function participant ; reduce arterial stiffness ; improve serum lipid ; theobromine ; clinically meaningful effect body weight waist circumference , CRP , glucose , insulin .</detailed_description>
