	<brief_summary>In endurance sport competition cycling , athlete 's capacity sustain submaximum power ( i.e . endurance capacity ) strongly influence overall race performance . Endurance capacity increase long , continuous endurance exercise moderate oxygen consumption , high-intensity ( peak oxygen consumption ) interval training . However , also show resistance exercise , perform addition endurance exercise , enhance endurance capacity . The investigator recently describe novel training method , base combine vibration resistance training superimpose vascular occlusion . Based investigator previous result show type training lead mark increase endurance capacity previously untrained young woman , investigator aim investigate whether method also effective increase endurance capacity highly endurance-trained young men , whether method lead big improvement relative resistance exercise alone . Besides functional outcome investigator also interested specificity cellular adaptation respect two training method .</brief_summary>
