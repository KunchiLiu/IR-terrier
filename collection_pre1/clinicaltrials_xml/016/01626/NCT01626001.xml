	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn way possibly reduce scan error use 4-dimensional compute tomography ( 4D CT ) scan check lung function patient esophageal lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Study Compare 4DCT Image</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedure : By use 4D CT scan , researcher create image show air move lungs . This new method check lung function may make good image standard method . Researchers compare 4 image air move lungs 1 image hold breath . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study ( screen test applicable ) agree take part study , enrol 1 2 study group , depend join study . There 18 participant group . In first group , researcher test several different method create image air move lung . Researchers select successful method first group try second group . Study Visits : You two visit study . At visit , four 4DCT scan perform ( Group 1 ) five scan ( Group 2 ) use 4DCT spiral CT , breathe normally . You also 1 scan hold breath less 20 second . The CT scan take 5 minute complete . If spiral CT scan Group 2 complete day 4DCT scan , ask willingness return later day complete . The 4D CT scan cover entire chest area use standard dose radiation . A 2-inch plastic box place top chest track motion chest breathe scan . Some part chest scan 2 time base breathing . The entire scanning session take 45 minute complete . Length Participation : Your active participation study complete study visit . Follow-Up Phone Call : Within 7 day last study visit , study staff call ask side effect may . This call last 2 minute . If anything unusual find imaging , cancer doctor tell receive follow-up . This investigational study . The CT scan use study deliver use FDA-approved commercially available system . Creating image air move lungs 4D CT scan consider investigational . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
