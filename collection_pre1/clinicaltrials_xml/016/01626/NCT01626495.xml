	<brief_summary>This study child previously treat Leukemia/Lymphoma . In particular , study people type Leukemia/Lymphoma involve B cell ( type white cell ) , contain cancer . This new approach treatment Leukemia/Lymphoma involve B cell ( tumor cell ) . This study take subject 's white blood cell ( T cell ) modify order target cancer . The subject 's T cell modify one two different way allow cell identify kill tumor cell ( B cell ) . Both way modify cell tell T cell go B cell ( tumor cell ) turn `` '' potentially kill B cell ( tumor cell ) . The modification genetic change T cell , gene transfer , order allow modify T cell recognize tumor cell normal cell subject 's body . These modify cell call chimeric antigen receptor 19 ( CART19 ) T-cells .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/IIA Study CART19 Cells Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant Refractory CD19+ Leukemia Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At entry subject stag suitability T cell CART-19 manufacturing determine . Subjects adequate T cell leukapheresed obtain large number peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) CART-19 manufacturing . The T cell purify PBMC , transduce CART-19 lentiviral vector , expand vitro frozen future administration . Chemotherapy give . Following tumor burden reassessment , CART-19 cell thaw infused . Subjects blood test assess safety , engraftment persistence CART-19 cell regular interval four week last infusion study . Following 6 month intensive follow-up , subject evaluate quarterly two year medical history , physical examination , blood test . Following evaluation , subject enter roll-over study annual follow-up phone questionnaire additional thirteen year assess diagnosis long-term health problem , development new malignancy . Primary objective : 1 . Determine safety feasibility administration chimeric antigen receptor T cell transduce anti-CD 19 lentiviral vector ( refer `` CART-19 '' cell ) . 2 . Determine duration vivio survival CART-19 cell . Real Time polymerase chain receptor ( RT-PCR ) analysis whole blood use detect quantify survival CART-19 TCR:4-1BB TCR cell time . Secondary objective : 1 . For patient detectable disease , measure anti-tumor response due CART-19 cell infusion . 2 . To determine 4-1BB transgene superior TCR transgene measure relative engraftment level CART-19 TCR:4-1BB TCR cell time . 3 . For patient store accessible tumor cell ( patient active chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , acute lymphoblastic leukema ( ALL ) , etc ) determine tumor cell kill CART-19 cell vitro . 4 . Determine cellular humoral host immunity develop murine anti-CD19 , assess correlation loss detectable CART-19 ( loss engraftment ) . 5 . Determine relative subset CART-19 T cell ( Tcm , Tem , Treg )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject CD 19+ B cell malignancy patient available curative treatment option ( autologous allogeneic SCT ) limit prognosis ( several month &lt; 2 year survival ) currently available therapy enrol : 1 . Eligible disease : CD 19+ leukemia lymphoma 1 . ALL without curative option therapy , include eligible allogeneic SCT : age comorbid disease contraindication TBIbased conditioning ( require ALL SCT ) lack suitable donor prior SCT Declines allo SCT ( CR3 ) therapeutic option document discussion role SCT BMT physician part study team . Note : Patient may complete response , patient may active disease respond stable recent therapy . The intent enroll patient degree disease control , rapidly increase disease burden enrollment cell infusion . 2 . Follicular lymphoma , previously identify CD19+ At least 2 prior combination chemotherapy regimen ( include single agent monoclonal antibody ( Rituxan ) therapy . Stage IIIIV disease . Less 1 year last chemotherapy progression ( i.e . recent progression free interval &lt; 1 year ) . Disease respond stable recent therapy ( chemotherapy , MoAb ) . 3 . CLL At least 2 prior chemotherapy regimen ( include single agent monoclonal antibody ( Rituxan ) therapy . Less 1 year last chemotherapy progression ( i.e . recent progression free interval &lt; 1 year ) . Not eligible appropriate conventional allogeneic SCT Disease respond stable recent therapy ( chemotherapy , MoAb ) 4 . Mantle cell lymphoma Beyond 1st CR relapse persistent disease eligible appropriate conventional allogeneic autologous SCT Disease respond stable recent therapy ( chemotherapy , MoAb ) Relapsed prior autologous SCT 5 . Bcell prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) relapse residual disease least 1 prior therapy eligible allogeneic SCT . 6 . Diffuse large cell lymphoma highgrade NHL , previously identify CD19+ Residual disease primary therapy eligible autologous SCT Relapsed prior autologous SCT Beyond 1st CR relapse persistent disease eligible appropriate conventional allogeneic autologous SCT 2 . Age 1 24 year . Patients age 2224 enrol currently treat CHOP another pediatric facility/oncologist 3 . Expected survival &gt; 12 week 4 . Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl less 2.5x normal age 5 . ALT â‰¤ 5x normal 6 . Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl 7 . Any relapse prior SCT make patient eligible regardless prior therapy 8 . Patients relapse disease prior allogeneic SCT ( myeloablative nonmyeloablative ) eligible meet inclusion criterion 1 . Have active GVHD require immunosuppression 2 . Are 4 month transplant 9 . For patient require leukapheresis T cell collection ( i.e . previously collect product exists ) , adequate venous access apheresis eligible appropriate catheter placement , contraindication leukapheresis 10 . Voluntary inform consent give 11 . Patients CNS3 disease eligible CNS disease responsive therapy ( infusion ) 1 . Pregnant lactating woman . The safety therapy unborn child know . Female study participant reproductive potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test perform within 48 hour infusion 2 . Uncontrolled active infection 3 . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection 4 . Concurrent use systemic steroid time cell infusion cell collection , condition , treat physician 's opinion , likely require steroid therapy collection infusion . Steroids disease treatment time cell collection time infusion permit . Use inhaled steroid , hydrocortisone physiological replacement patient adrenal insufficiency permit well 5 . Presence grade 24 acute extensive chronic GVHD 6 . Under treatment GVHD 7 . Previous treatment gene therapy product 8 . Any uncontrolled active medical disorder would preclude participation outline . 9 . HIV infection . 10 . CNS3 disease progressive therapy , CNS parenchymal lesion might increase risk CNS toxicity</criteria>
