	<brief_summary>The purpose study examination Mapisal® versus urea hand-foot cream prophylaxis capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome ( HFS ) patient gastrointestinal tumor breast cancer , assess efficacy Mapisal® . Mapisal® medical device approve prophylaxis treatment HFS . Initial clinical data case study treatment prophylaxis Caelyx-induced HFS impressive . Because pathomechanism HFS cause capecitabine Caelyx-induced HFS , expect reason administer Mapisal® result significant reduction HFS cause capecitabine . The urea hand-foot cream select standard arm , use commonly , accept patient , seem positive influence severity HFS experience many oncologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-label Phase III Trial Mapisal® Versus Urea Hand-foot Cream Prophylaxis Capecitabine-induced Hand-foot Syndrome Patients With Gastrointestinal Tumors Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand-foot syndrome ( HFS ) frequently occur , often dose limit , dermatologic reaction associate cytotoxic agent , capecitabine , liposomal doxorubicin , doxetacel . Adverse event affect integument pose significant challenge oncologists recent year term select appropriate supportive therapy . Not medication inhibit EGFR receptor erlotinib , gefitinib , panitumumab cetuximab , also multiple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib sorafenib `` old '' medication capecitabine often lead skin-related adverse event difficult manage . These adverse event compromise skin-related quality life lead dose compromise even termination treatment . To date , side effect report use either Mapisal® urea hand-foot cream , make treatment safe . Given potential benefit treatment prevent HFS reduce discomfort impairment quality life , conduct trial regard justifiable indication patient expose increase risk associate study participation .</detailed_description>
