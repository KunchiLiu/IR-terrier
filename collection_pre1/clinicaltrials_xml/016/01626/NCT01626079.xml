This randomize controlled trial provide opportunity strengthen add label claim regard safety clinical benefit MitraClip System symptomatic heart failure patient moderate-to-severe severe functional mitral regurgitation . Approximately 610 subject randomize 100 investigational site approximately 305 subject target receive study device . As part COAPT trial , subset patient register cardiopulmonary exercise ( CPX ) sub-study . The objective sub-study evaluate exercise responses sub-cohort COAPT subject receive MitraClip device ( Device group ) compare Control group receive MitraClip device .

	<criteria>1 . Symptomatic functional MR ( ≥3+ ) due cardiomyopathy either ischemic nonischemic etiology determine assessment qualify transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) obtain within 90 day transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) obtain within 180 day prior subject registration , MR severity base principally TTE study , confirm Echocardiography Core Lab ( ECL ) . The ECL may request transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) confirm MR etiology . Note : Functional MR require presence global regional leave ventricular wall motion abnormality , believe primary cause MR . If flail leaflet evidence degenerative MR present , subject eligible even global regional leave ventricular systolic dysfunction present . Note : Qualifying TTE must obtain subject stabilize optimal therapy include Guideline Directed Medical Therapy ( GDMT ) least 30 day : 1. great 100 % increase great 50 % decrease dose GDMT 2. revascularization and/or implant Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device ( CRT CRTD ) reprogramming implant CRT CRTD result increase biventricular pacing ( &lt; 92 % ≥92 % ) 2 . In judgment HF specialist investigator site , subject adequately treat per applicable standard , include coronary artery disease , leave ventricular dysfunction , mitral regurgitation heart failure ( e.g. , cardiac resynchronization therapy , revascularization , and/or GDMT ) . The Eligibility Committee must also concur subject adequately treat . 3 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Class II , III ambulatory IV . 4 .
