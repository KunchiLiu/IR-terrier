	<brief_title>Study Bendamustine Ofatumumab Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Who Are Poor Candidates R-CHOP Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While R-CHOP improve survival consider standard care patient DLBCL , toxicity associate R-CHOP substantial elderly population . This one several reason outcome old patient worse corresponding young patient . Bendamustine alkylating agent cause intra- inter-strand cross-link DNA base . Ofatumumab fully human anti-CD 20 antibody well tolerate elderly patient . Ofatumumab target novel epitope CD20 molecule B cell remain cell surface twice long rituximab . The combination agent allow potentially efficacious , less toxic regimen .</detailed_description>
