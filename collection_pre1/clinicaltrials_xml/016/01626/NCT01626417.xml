	<brief_summary>The objective clinical study examine acute kinematics kinetics utilize Tibion Bionic Leg sample chronic post-stroke patient perform sit-to-stand stand-to-sit transfer across range assistance resistance setting ( internal device ) ; compare metric baseline performance without Bionic Leg ; determine Bionic Leg setting optimize restorative ( equal force distribution ) movement state patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Transfer Kinematics Kinetics Patients Chronic Post-stroke Using Tibion Bionic Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comprehensive motion ( kinetics kinematics ) data specific sit-to-stand stand-to-sit transfer without Tibion Bionic Leg . The Vicon Motion Analysis System utilized track movement use marker subject Bionic Leg per UCSF Human Performance Center 's routine . Once outfit marker system , patient instruct perform multiple sit-to-stand stand-to-sit transfer data gather . The sit-to-stand stand-to-sit transfer perform use standard chair , seat height less 12 '' floor . The chair position , sit rest , subject 's foot position limb-specific force plate ( left right ) .</detailed_description>
