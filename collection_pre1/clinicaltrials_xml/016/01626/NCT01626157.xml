	<brief_summary>Inflammation present Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) airway time infancy , worsen onset chronic infection . Therapies prove benefit associate decreased airway inflammation . Thus , sensitive reproducible biomarkers airway inflammation long seek necessary component improve clinical care facilitate therapeutic trial CF . FEV1 , standard outcome measure CF , recognize insensitive outcome measure . investigator identify panel 10 gene sensitively predict resolution pulmonary inflammation , response therapy acute pulmonary exacerbation . With goal yield technically simple unique CF biomarker assay , investigator test whether protein signify gene show large change expression follow treatment acute pulmonary exacerbation . Protein quantification among common measurement perform clinical laboratory around world . Based preliminary finding change white blood cell proteins mirror change see gene , investigator propose identify top candidate protein , investigator gene panel , change response exacerbation therapy . Once identify , protein quantify directly new blood test inexpensive simple perform . The investigator propose validate blood test single site trial . If successful , proposal yield biomarker assay available validate multi-site trial provide unique insight mechanisms regulate white blood cell activation recruitment CF lung disease .</brief_summary>
