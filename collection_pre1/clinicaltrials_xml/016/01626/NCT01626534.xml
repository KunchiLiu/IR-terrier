	<brief_summary>Ticagrelor new P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist . This drug demonstrate faster onset action higher potency compare clopidogrel standard regimen . Consistently property associate PLATO trial , particularly percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) arm study , low incidence thrombotic complication one year follow-up price increase major bleeding ( 7,8 ) . The major find trial significant reduction one year mortality patient treat ticagrelor . This reduction mortality may relate anti-platelet effect drug since another potent anti-platelet agent recently commercialize exhibit improvement death compare clopidogrel . Therefore may non anti platelet direct property , pleiotropic effect , ticagrelor could involve reduction mortality acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient . In fact together anti platelet property , ticagrelor , show inhibit uptake adenosine red cell , lead increase adenosine plasma level activate low affinity adenosine receptor thus potentially affect vascular homeostasis include endothelial cell . Therefore , hypothesis side effect benefit mortality may relate interaction adenosine metabolism . In line hypothesis , adverse effect ticagrelor ( bradycardia modulation bronchoconstriction ) compatible activation low affinity A1 A2A adenosine receptor . In addition investigator recently demonstrate P2Y12 ADP blockade impact endothelial compartment PCI ( 9 ) . In fact investigator observe level PR inhibition achieve clopidogrel PCI correlate extent endothelial damage PCI . More potent anti platelet drug ticagrelor may thus associate reduced peri-procedural endothelial lesion could improve clinical prognosis patient . The investigator previously observe endothelial marker lesion regeneration could measure blood post PCI ( 10 ) . Finally , response trial patient ticagrelor arm HTPR compare 50 % clopidogrel arm ( 7 ) . This finding surprising since recent data suggest patient still exhibit HTPR follow use potent third generation thienopyridine prasugrel . This may relate fact response trial stable patient include . The investigator aim evaluate anti-platelet efficacy pleiotropic effect ticagrelor acute coronary syndrome patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention .</brief_summary>
