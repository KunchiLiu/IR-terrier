	<brief_summary>It investigators hypothesis exemestane ( EXE ) metabolism important source inter-individual variation EXE metabolic profile polymorphisms EXE-metabolizing enzyme may potentially play role affect EXE therapeutic efficacy toxicity . The goal clinical study ( 1 ) establish EXE metabolism profile kinetics , ( 2 ) determine whether correlation exist vivo metabolize enzyme genotype urinary EXE metabolite profile woman treat EXE . Together , study allow u fully characterize functionally-relevant polymorphism EXE-metabolizing enzyme pathway potentially important EXE clinical efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) widely use adjuvant treatment estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer post-menopausal woman . AIs demonstrate equal great efficacy less toxicity tamoxifen ( TAM ) , drug choice many year . Exemestane ( EXE ) 3rd-generation AI demonstrate efficacy treatment breast cancer patient , TAM AIs , considerable inter-individual variability overall response EXE occurrence toxicity , cause variability elucidate . Differences drug metabolism source variability patient . Genetic variation occur several enzyme involve phase I II metabolic reaction many lead alteration enzyme activity turn alter therapeutic response drug . EXE extensively metabolize unchanged EXE find less 1 % urine 10 % plasma . EXE pharmacokinetics establish series 20 subject take EXE . EXE metabolites measure optimal time post-EXE dose urine 200 breast cancer patient treat EXE establish whether metabolize enzyme genotype-EXE metabolism phenotype correlation exist vivo .</detailed_description>
