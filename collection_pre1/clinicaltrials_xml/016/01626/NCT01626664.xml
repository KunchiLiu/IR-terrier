Patients hepatitis C antibody positive hepatitis C quantitative PCR negative may enrol ; Has hepatitis B base PCR test hepatitis B virus DNA . Patients hepatitis B core antibody positive PCR negative may enrol placed appropriate antihepatitis B virus prophylaxis prior commence treatment KW0761 . Patients hepatitis B core antibody positive base prior vaccination need receive prophylaxis ; Have malignancy past two year except nonmelanoma skin cancer , melanoma situ , localized cancer prostate current PSA &lt; 0.1 µg/mL , treat thyroid cancer cervical carcinoma situ ductal/lobular carcinoma situ breast currently without evidence disease ; Clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement metastasis .
