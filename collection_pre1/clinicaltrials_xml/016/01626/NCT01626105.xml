	<brief_summary>This study design accurately identify pharmacogenetic determinant risk Factor VIII ( FVIII ) inhibitor development focus select group Hemophilia A ( HA ) patient : ( ) receive recombinant FVIII therapeutic product contain primary amino acid sequence since original diagnosis ; ( ii ) verifiable FVIII infusion history ; ( iii ) test regularly FVIII inhibitor development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We develop novel , personalized strategy assess immunogenicity protein therapeutic use , model , infusion Factor VIII ( FVIII ) hemophilia A ( HA ) patient . About 20 % treated HA patient develop neutralize FVIII alloantibody ( `` inhibitor '' ) make disease management difficult expensive . Nowadays , HA usually treat highly purified human recombinant ( r ) -proteins , advance safety pathogen accompany decrease inhibitor incidence . Current strategy upcoming FVIII formulation focus largely engineering immunogenic epitope hope form universally less immunogenic protein . In contrast , pioneer pharmacogenetic approach immunogenicity take account underlying variability patient population . This project focus define role individual genetic difference FVIII immunogenicity . The principle , however , broad application protein therapeutic general . We study non-HA-causing variant FVIII gene ( F8 ) show ( ) nonsynonymous ( n ) -single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) encode several structurally distinct wild-type FVIII proteins human population ( ii ) sequence mismatch patient ' endogenous FVIII infuse FVIII due ns-SNPs risk factor inhibitor development may explain high inhibitor incidence HA patient black African ancestry . The well establish risk factor inhibitor development type HA-causing F8 gene mutation . As rule , large alteration F8 absence antigenically cross-reactive material ( CRM ) plasma associate inhibitor development . The common F8 mutation cause severe HA , intron-22-inversion ( I22I ) , fit description associate high inhibitor risk . Similarly , HA patient missense mutation develop inhibitor , alloimmune complication occur frequently patient one highly recurrent missense mutation . While definitively establish , population heterogeneity repertoires HLA-class-II ( HLA-II ) molecule express surface antigen-presenting cell individual patient likely another genetic contributor inhibitor risk . This project comprehensive assessment pharmacogenetics immune response FVIII leveraging unique resource comprise group 55 subject severe moderately-severe HA ( ) enrol previously-untreated patient ( PUPs ) recently conclude clinical trial know Advate PUP study ( ii ) receive r-FVIII protein ( i.e. , Advate ) since birth . Prior PUP-study data well new blood sample data obtain subject upon enrollment current study . In addition treat single FVIII product , exceptional patient cohort ( continue ) closely monitor FVIII infusion history inhibitor development , latter undergoing frequent Bethesda testing . ( HA patient treat several FVIII product ideal test hypothesis propose . )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients severe moderately severe hemophilia A ( HA ) since birth treat single Factor VIII product ( i.e. , FVIII protein molecule contain one primary amino acid sequence ) . HA patient severity severe moderately severe . Hemophilia B patient . HA patient treat one FVIII product . HA patient treat one FVIII product . HA patient verifiable infusion history . HA patient lack documentable inhibitor test &amp; infusion history .</criteria>
