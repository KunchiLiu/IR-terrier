	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate safest effective dose Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug ( XIAFLEX ) treatment lipoma ( fatty tumor vary size occur commonly adult population ) . The fat lipoma like normal fat except enclosed balloon-like structure make collagen ( fibrous tissue ) . Treatment lipoma injection XIAFLEX ( protein break collagen fiber ) may dissolve collagen/fibrous strand thereby decrease size lipoma removing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study Using Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum Treatment Lipoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipomas common mesenchymal , benign , fatty tumor vary size occur general adult population . They usually present painful annoy lumps palpable often visible subcutaneous tissue . Many subcutaneous lipoma asymptomatic remove non-medical reason . However , may cause subject pain discomfort interfere normal activity . Spontaneous remission lipoma report . A lipoma , present , remain lifetime person carry may stay small become large . Alternative treatment lipoma surgery liposuction . If large excision perform problem large scar accompany issue heal large scar , possible formation hematoma follow consolidation hematoma remnant mass scar tissue . This often painful problematic original lipoma . liposuction also potential hematoma formation follow scar mass residual . To avoid complication list , non-invasive method treatment , enzyme mediate disassociation adipose tissue , would desirable . The primary aim study perform step-wise approach dose evaluate safety efficacy clostridium histolyticum non-operative treatment lipoma .</detailed_description>
