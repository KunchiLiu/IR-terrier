	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) irreversible degeneration articular cartilage underlie bone . It pose major healthcare problem lead cause joint disease disability United States . It traditionally think OA consequence age joint trauma . However , think OA result interplay multiple genetic , biomechanical , biochemical factor disrupt normal homeostasis cartilage , bone , synovium . OA classify two group , primary secondary . Primary OA classically polyarticular peripheral secondary OA commonly attribute specific cause , limited singular joint , result trauma . It known post-traumatic OA ( PTOA ) . Other cause secondary OA include congenital disorder , calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition disease , diseases . Regardless classification , genetic variation normal metabolism cartilage bone think play role progression OA . Furthermore , polyarticular presentation primary idiopathic osteoarthritis suggest may stronger genetic component compare secondary OA , indicate deviation normal cartilage bone homeostasis . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) inhibitor take part metabolism cartilage bone . MMPs enzymes catalyze degradation element within joint space inhibitor cease activity . Alpha-2-Macroglobulin ( A2M ) naturally-occurring plasma glycoprotein function throughout multiple tissue extracellular space protease inhibitor normally reach high level within intra-articular joint space . A2M believe modulate systemic inflammatory response ability bait , trap , clear various MMPs cytokine . Concentrated A2M directly address role cytokine catabolic enzymes know participate development osteoarthritis . Cytonics show A2M inhibit cartilage degradation vitro . As role MMPs protease inhibitor emerge key component OA , investigation regulator MMP become interest elucidate pathogenesis possible novel treatment OA . This study aim measure correlate level alpha-2-Macroglobulin ( A2M ) plasma knee joint OA primary post-traumatic ( PTOA ) secondary osteoarthritis group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single institution observational study . Pre-procedure diagnosis : Based chart review consultation operate surgeon subject undergoing total knee arthroplasty , patient group primary secondary ( PTOA ) osteoarthritis group . Primary osteoarthritis identify clinical presentation generalize osteoarthritis possible bilateral involvement identifiable trauma overuse knee joint . Secondary osteoarthritis identify history overuse trauma afflict knee clinical presentation general lack symmetrical involvement and/or severity , PTOA . On date surgery , primary secondary group 2 cc whole blood collect via venipuncture placement intravenous access anesthesia . No additional venipuncture necessary study necessitates instrumentation/manipulation patient beyond IV access normally obtain preoperatively . Blood place refrigerated storage ( 2-6 C ) analyze A2M assay . On date surgery , joint aspirate primary secondary group collect operate surgeon knee arthroplasty . At time arthrotomy , joint fluid express surgical site harvest placed eppendorf tube place ice . The study incur risk patient instrumentation/manipulation synovial fluid harvest beyond risk instrumentation/manipulation indicate surgical procedure . Joint aspirate store A2M assay .</detailed_description>
