	<brief_title>Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy With Without Pelvic Drain Placement Reducing Adverse Events After Surgery Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine eliminate placement pelvic drain patient robotic assist laparoscopic prostatectomy ( RALP ) increase incidence early postoperative adverse event occur within 90 day prostatectomy , compare patient pelvic drain place RALP . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine incidence early postoperative adverse event patient without pelvic drain adjustment confounders associate event make ( confounders : demographic , surgical pathologic ; age , body mass index [ BMI ] , pathologic stage , Gleason sum , extent lymph node dissection ) . II . To report peri-operative postoperative outcome , include limited , length hospital stay , re-admissions , continence , potency incidence medical intervention patient without pelvic drain . III . To compare early postoperative adverse event rate patient without pelvic drain patient extend pelvic lymph node dissection RALP . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo RALP . ARM II : Patients undergo RALP placement pelvic drain . After completion treatment , patient follow 1 week 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
