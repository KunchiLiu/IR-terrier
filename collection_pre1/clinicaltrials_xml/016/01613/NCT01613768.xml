	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate eribulin per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) patient locally advanced refractory metastatic salivary gland cancer ( SGC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity eribulin patient locally advanced refractory metastatic SGC . II . Evaluate duration response time-to-progression . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 2-5 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
