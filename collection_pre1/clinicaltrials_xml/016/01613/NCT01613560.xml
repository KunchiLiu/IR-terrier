	<brief_title>Clinical Study Adjuvant Therapy Post-menopausal Women With Breast Cancer Under Guidance Results Preoperative Endocrinotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In decision-making process systemic adjuvant therapy ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer , avoid adjuvant chemotherapy attractive hard choice . On one hand , result tamoxifen endocrine therapy combine adjuvant chemotherapy superior tamoxifen endocrine therapy alone ER-positive breast cancer patient ; hand , benefit adjuvant chemotherapy provide breast cancer high hormone receptor expression clear tolerance chemotherapy much low endocrinotherapy . St. Galen consensus adjuvant therapy early breast cancer recommend adopt simple endocrinotherapy avoid adjuvant chemotherapy medium- low- risk breast cancer hormone receptor highly express . However , result study P024 IMPACT suggest hormone receptor expression insufficient predict effect endocrinotherapy . At present , proven clinical value neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy assist surgery . Consensus recommend neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy patient postmenopausal breast cancer plan receive simple adjuvant endocrinotherapy . The current study result show neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy may use experimental treatment platform , i.e. , predict result adjuvant endocrinotherapy comprehensive analysis multiple index surgery sample neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy . By use P024 IMPACT sample , Ellis et al studied relation survival test result surgery sample neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy , obtain PEPI ( preoperative endocrine prognostic index ) . They preliminarily prove PEPI score relative RFS ( relapse-free survival ) postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer treat simple endocrinotherapy BCSS ( breast cancer-specific survival ) . A retrospective study，performed breast prevention treatment center Peking University Cancer Hospital，shows RFS PEPI score ≤ 1 group superior PEPI &gt; 1 group 16 week neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy ( p = 0.037 ) , RFS effective group ( Miller &amp; Payne G1G2G3 ) well ineffective group ( p=0.001 ) term pathological evaluation . The objective study prospectively verify relation efficacy neoadjuvant hormonal therapy , preliminarily explore clinical value complementary adjuvant chemotherapy predict poor prognosis malignant breast cancer neoadjuvant endocrinotherapy .</detailed_description>
