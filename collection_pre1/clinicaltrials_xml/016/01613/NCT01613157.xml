	<detailed_description>There tremendous advance treatment HIV combine 3 4 20 anti-HIV medication available . Despite advance , remain several important complication related treatment , importantly adverse event like nausea , diarrhea , liver toxicity lipodystrophy ( fat waste accumulation ) . Some study find drug level higher woman higher drug level associate increased toxicity woman . The reason high drug level remain unclear . It unknown whether relate hormonal influence , drug metabolism , adherence , fat distribution , body size factor . For reason , would like carry study measure drug level HIV-infected woman take anti-HIV medication . This study determine predictor high drug level ass association drug level adverse event woman .</detailed_description>
