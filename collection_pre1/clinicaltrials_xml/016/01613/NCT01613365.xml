	<brief_summary>Despite improvement per postoperative management , major pulmonary surgery continue carry high morbidity significant mortality . Among postoperative complication , respiratory failure ( nosocomial pneumonia , ARDS ) currently frequent serious , well primary cause hospital death , major pulmonary resection . Vast majority complication notoriously infectious consider hospital-acquired infection . These complication result dramatic increase substantial hospital cost term length hospital stay , antibiotic morbidity . Current management complication stand antibiotic , oxygen supply physiotherapy . In severe case , ventilatory support ( invasive non invasive ) justify near 25 % case . Recent data suggest proximal airway colonization could essential first step pathogenesis theses respiratory failure . Previous work long demonstrate bacterial colonization frequent 21 40 % lung cancer patient . These colonization could act major predispose factor postoperative respiratory failure . Because distal airway lung parenchyma free bacteria moment surgery , respiratory complication result contamination potential microorganism belong upper aero-digestive tract . Consequently , decontamination oropharyngeal nasopharyngeal cavity first day surgery could beneficial advantage prevention complication . This decontamination demonstrate effective critically-ill patient intensive care unit , cardiac surgery esophageal surgery . Decontamination oropharynx nasopharynx Chlorhexidine Gluconate significantly reduce rate postoperative global hospital-acquired infection respiratory infectious well . To date , data efficacy decontamination protocol major pulmonary resection available .</brief_summary>
