	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis Macular Degeneration , i.e. , least three , hard soft drusen must present must RPE change ( migration , clump atrophy ) within central 6mm retina . 2 . As prerequisite entry study , patient diagnosis dry AMD confirm ophthalmologist via retinal exam Fluorescein Angiography also determine whether subject candidate laser surgery . Only subject AMD admit study . 3 . Both sex eligible . 4 . The bestcorrected visual acuity well 20/40 bad 20/100 treated eye . 5 . Age great 50 . 6 . Subjects must highly motivate , alert , orient , mentally competent able understand comply requirement study , abide restriction , return require visit , provide voluntary informed consent . 7 . Both eye subject must show evidence wet AMD . If one eye wet fellow eye dry , subject exclude . 1 . Subjects seizure disorder . 2 . Subjects additional eyerelated disease associate ongoing retinal bleeding . 3 . Subjects implanted electrical device . 4 . Subjects smoke , average , half pack cigarette per day last 5 year . 5 . Subjects know allergy contrast dye . 6 . Subjects poor general health , unstable disease , terminally ill , life expectancy le 12 month , nonambulatory bedridden , live geographical location would likely prevent regular attendance study visit consider suitable participation investigator . 7 . Subjects expose investigational device drug within past 30 day involve concurrently treatment clinical trial . Note : Subjects participate study investigate natural progression AMD may participate trial . 8 . Subjects unwilling adhere visit examination schedule describe study protocol . 9 . Subjects know history alcoholism , drug abuse , psychosis , clinical evidence depression , poor motivation , emotional intellectual problem , condition would likely limit validity consent appropriate response participate study deem unsuitable psychologically physiologically study participation investigator . 10 . Any subject experience acute stressor , opinion investigator , might affect course treatment AMD . 11 . Anyone diagnosis malignant poorly control glaucoma eye ( ) would treat . 12 . Anyone diabetic retinopathy . 13 . Anyone progressive corneal dystrophy eye ( ) would treat . 14 . Anyone note chorio retinal disease ( AMD ) eye ( ) would treat . 15 . Anyone progressive nuclear cataract eye ( ) would treat . Stable cortical cataract patient may include . Any patient immature cataract , one scattered opacity separate clear zone , may include study . All patient mature , hypermature morgagnian cataract eye ( ) would treat excluded . Patients grade 3 grade 4 cataract eye ( ) would treat excluded . Grade 1 Grade 2 cataract patient may include study . 16 . Subjects participate AMD natural history study . 17 . Subjects one eye diagnose wet AMD . 18 . Subjects previous retinal bleeding , injury , retinal surgery . 19 . Subjects previously diagnose amblyopia . 20 . Subjects currently take bloodthinning medication . 21 . Subjects previously involve TESMACâ„¢ study . 22 . Subjects take two follow antioxidant daily follow dos : 500 milligram vitamin C ; 400 international unit vitamin E ; 15 milligram betacarotene ; 80 milligram zinc zinc oxide ; two milligram copper cupric oxide do 2 year . These subject may include , study result analyze separately .</criteria>
