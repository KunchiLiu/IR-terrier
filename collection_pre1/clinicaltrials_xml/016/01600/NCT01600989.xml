	<brief_summary>Introduction : Evidence suggest sepsis septic shock severely impair mitochondrion result mitochondrial dysfunction relate severity outcome result organ dysfunction . In sepsis mitochondrial abnormality - biochemical ultrastructural - recognize multiple organ , include liver , kidney , skeletal heart muscle tissue blood cell . Circulating immune cell play important role pathophysiology sepsis . Stimulation immune system alters energy requirement immune cell ; down-regulation immune-cell activity associate prolonged sepsis unfavourable outcome . The aim project comprehensively investigate change mitochondrial function immune cell patient severe sepsis septic shock . The follow main hypothesis evaluate : - Severe sepsis septic shock lead increase energy requirement immune cell increase mitochondrial enzyme activity energy production . - Changes mitochondrial function human immune cell associate alteration clinical laboratory marker severity sepsis . - Prolonged sepsis unfavourable outcome associate regulation mitochondrial function . Methods : A total 30 adult patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) due severe sepsis septic shock include study ; 30 healthy volunteer serve control . Patients type chronic infectious , inflammatory autoimmune disease , transplantation receive immunosuppressive agent exclude . Collected baseline characteristic include patient demographic , diagnosis severity illness score time admission . Daily collect follow data include clinical laboratory parameter organ dysfunction , use vasopressors/inotropes , use antibiotic , use steroid result microbiological cultures/stains . Negative identification isolation monocyte , B cell CD4 T cell perform daily ICU admission discharge use antibody-antigen mediate immunomagnetic cell isolation procedure deplete blood cell except specific target cell . Mitochondrial function immune cell assess measurement mitochondrial complex activity complex I IV standard titration protocol . Additionally , level pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine ( Interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-α ) assess throughout stay ICU . For comparison mitochondrial function monocyte , B cell CD4 T cell cytokine level measure group 10 healthy volunteer . Analysis plan : Changes mitochondrial function immune cell time compare healthy control group course severe sepsis septic shock main outcome parameter study . Assessed predictor determine severity underlie septic condition include clinical laboratory evidence dysfunction vital organ system change level inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Evidence suggest sepsis septic shock severely impair mitochondrion result mitochondrial dysfunction relate severity outcome result organ dysfunction . In sepsis mitochondrial abnormality - biochemical ultrastructural - recognize multiple organ , include liver , kidney , skeletal heart muscle tissue blood cell . A systematic review mitochondrial function assess oxygen consumption , state 3 state 4 respiration , respiratory enzyme activity , tissue ATP level turnover rate show decreased function especially sepsis model last 16h . Depleted level reduce glutathione , important intra-mitochondrial antioxidant , combination increase generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reactive nitrogen specie ( RNS ) inhibit oxidative phosphorylation ATP generation . This acquire intrinsic derangement cellular energy metabolism contributes reduce activity mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme complex impair ATP biosynthesis contributes organ dysfunction sepsis . Circulating immune cell play important role pathophysiology sepsis . Stimulation immune system alters energy requirement immune cell ; down-regulation immune-cell activity associate prolonged sepsis . Immune cell activation mandate increase energy requirement , thus reduce production ATP due impair mitochondrial function may factor modulate immune response sepsis . Alterations mitochondrial function energetic failure report peripheral blood mononuclear cell seem associate modulation immune response sepsis . Macrophages incubate endotoxin/interferon-γ show decrease oxygen consumption inhibition mitochondrial I complex . Different mechanisms alteration mitochondrial function cell propose , include increase NO production nitration mitochondrial protein [ 14 ] , elevation IL-10 [ 15 ] prostaglandin level . In human neutrophil intact mitochondrial function play important role chemotaxis phagocytosis , impairment mechanism lead decreased defence ability microbial challenge . HIF-1α transcription factor act key regulatory factor evolution oxygen homeostasis . Under normoxic condition HIF-1α continuously synthesize degraded hydroxylation dioxygenases utilize oxygen , Fe α-ketoglutarate substrate . During hypoxia , low availability oxygen limit reaction ; HIF-1α longer degrade rapidly accumulate trigger transcription gene involve oxygen homeostasis glycolytic enzyme , glucose transporter , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) erythropoietin . Under hypoxic condition , HIF mediate also decrease mRNA level respiratory chain protein , prepare cell produce ATP mainly glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation , thereby optimize cell energetics homeostasis survival function hypoxia . Recent publish report link inflammation endotoxin stimulation HIF-1α activation . HIF-1α show up-regulated stabilized LPS-treated macrophage monocyte normoxic condition . HIF-1α level show decreased macrophage deficient TLR4 LPS stimulation , suggest LPS stimulation HIF-1α mediate TLR4 . Data mitochondrial function human immune cell severe sepsis limit potential correlation mitochondrial energy requirement production severity patient 's condition outcome well establish . The immunologic reaction context severe sepsis septic shock consist interdependent , highly complex system involve different type immune cell pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine involve time-dependent process . Simple in-vitro study assess mitochondrial function single type immune cell single cytokine one point time course septic process might appropriate model mirror complex interaction immune system . Serial measurement mitochondrial function different key-player cell specific pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine apoptosis marker parallel clinical laboratory marker sepsis may offer in-depth evaluation understand deleterious disease pattern . Objective The aim project comprehensively investigate change mitochondrial function morphology immune cell patient severe sepsis septic shock . We plan assess change mitochondrial function monocyte , B cell CD4+ T cell correlation level various cytokine classic clinical laboratory parameter severity sepsis outcome . Methods A total 30 patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) tertiary care hospital due severe sepsis septic shock include study obtain write informed consent patient patient 's next kin . Patients type chronic infectious , inflammatory autoimmune disease , transplantation receive immunosuppressive agent exclude . Controls : 30 healthy volunteer Assessment mitochondrial function monocytes/granulocytes perform measurement mitochondrial complex activity use standard titration protocol measure activation complex I IV . To measure serum level IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 TNF standard commercial kit use .</detailed_description>
