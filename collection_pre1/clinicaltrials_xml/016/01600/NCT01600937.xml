	<brief_title>Italian Diabetes Exercise Study 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase prevalence type 2 diabetes associate age population , significant rise prevalence obesity , sedentary lifestyle . In Italy , prevalence diabetes approximately 6 % , 90-95 % diabetic subject type 2 . Strong evidence support importance physical activity management type 2 diabetes . However , current guideline difficult put action target population barrier poor patient long-term compliance difficult even identify best strategy physical activity behavior change . Existing study employ small group clinically-based approach limit theoretical grounding recommend health behavior change . Most fail offer practical , sustainable , economically viable solution , document long-term intervention efficacy . This study propose monitor objective measurable change LTPA 3-year period behavioral intervention ( Physician recommendation daily PA without supervise exercise training include individual theoretic &amp; practical counseling ) . Hopefully , behavioral intervention would offer feasible procedure long-term maintenance physical activity thus meet call change paradigm move beyond limited clinical focus include theoretically population-based `` real-life '' approach management Type 2 Diabetes . After selection eligibility run-in period , patient randomize two group : 1 ) exercise ( EXE ) group receive theoretical &amp; practical exercise counsel include 2 sessions/ per wk 1 month supervise exercise training ; 2 ) control ( CON ) group receive standard care include general physician recommendation daily PA. Changes physical activity behavior quantify use accelerometer , addition daily diary .</detailed_description>
