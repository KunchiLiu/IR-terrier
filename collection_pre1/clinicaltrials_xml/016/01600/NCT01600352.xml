	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinical utility specific autoantibody test unmask underlying connective tissue disorder patient present interstitial lung disease find weak positive ANA ( 1:400 titre ) overt connective tissue disease manifestation OR borderline/negative ANA clinical suggestion connective tissue disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specific Autoantibody Testing Patients With Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well establish patient connective tissue disease associate interstitial lung disease respond well immunosuppressive therapy , good outcome compare patient idiopathic interstitial pneumonia . This make imperative identify group patient management prognostication . Unfortunately patient demonstrate overt clinical manifestation connective tissue disease current available autoantibody screen detect potential autoantibody present . We would like test specific autoantibody group patient evaluate clinical utility identify covert connective tissue disease associate interstitial lung disease .</detailed_description>
