	<brief_title>Determining Impact Medication Delivery Unit Medication Adherence Adults With Common Cardiac Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Care transition intervention successful reduce medication-related problem associate rehospitalization primarily focus medication reconciliation conduct trained healthcare professional . Programs improve medication reconciliation process largely effective limitation , include : expense associate recruiting , training , retain care transition healthcare professional ; ability provide service within finite geographic area ; retrospective nature reconciliation process , usually occur home follow hospital discharge . Our short-term objective determine impact INRange Systems Electronic Medication Management Assistant ( EMMA ) medication delivery unit ( MDU ) adult require medication assistance home immediately follow acute hospitalization diagnosis common cardiac condition . As part study , determine : ( 1 ) Medication adherence rate ( # doses/doses schedule ; EMMA ( intervention ) vs. determine manual monthly pill count day 1 , 45 90 ( control ) ) ; ( 2 ) Health service utilization ; ( 3 ) Health economic assessment health plan societal perspective ; ( 4 ) Medication administration error ; ( 5 ) Patient experience satisfaction ; ( 6 ) Medication reconciliation error ( use medication discrepancy tool ) ; ( 7 ) 30-day readmission rate ; ( 8 ) Factors relate continued use EMMA MDU . Study Overview Design : The research study design associate proposal randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . The primary endpoint compare medication adherence adult patient recently hospitalize diagnosis congestive heart failure require medication assistance either receive usual care ( i.e. , control group ; take medication hospitalization ) use medication delivery unit ( i.e. , intervention group ; take medication device , always differ usual way medication take prior hospitalization ) . Study duration : The overall study last total 12 month . Each subject enrol period 90 day regardless unit randomization ( i.e. , control/usual care vs. intervention ) . Subject Recruitment : One-hundred sixty patient &gt; 18 year old admit UPMC Presbyterian Hospital consider potential study participant . Records patient pre-screened within 24 hour admittance use inclusion exclusion criterion assess without direct patient contact . Participants pass initial/exclusion criterion visit Research Assistant follow agreement patient 's attend physician . The Research Assistant introduce goal design study , take informed consent , complete remain exclusion instrument , MMSE , CAM , test medication delivery unit interface , question regard subject ' travel hospice plan . Detailed Description Research Activities Performed : Following administrative medical record review UPMC Case Manager review inclusion exclusion criterion , potential subject 's attend physician contact review patient 's study eligibility . If attending agreement information collect UPMC Health Plan Case Manager , patient eligible consent Research Assistant . The Research Assistant approach patient explain entire research project obtain write oral informed consent . Once informed consent obtain , enrollment questionnaire complete , consist follow component : 1 ) Medication adherence use MMAS-4 ( Morisky 4-Item Self-Report Measure Medication-Taking Behavior ) CRN-2 ( Cost-related non-adherence ) ; 2 ) Cognitive status assessment use MMSE ; 3 ) Delirium assessment use CAM ; 4 ) EMMA Medication Delivery Unit proficiency test ; 5 ) Demographics appointment scheduling . If patient meet additional exclusion criterion contain within enrollment questionnaire , patient consider enrol study . Randomization process : Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize base number medication prescribe : &gt; 5 medication ( polypharmacy group ) &lt; 5 medication ( non-polypharmacy group ) . Once determination patient polypharmacy non-polypharmacy group , research assistant select sequentially number envelope either polypharmacy non-polypharmacy envelope stack . The envelope contain randomization sequence number determine patient enrol control intervention group . Discharge Planning Transitional Care Control group : For enrol intervention group , UPMC Health Plan work RxPartners LTC ( wholly own subsidiary UPMC ) perform medication regimen review complete `` cost '' patient expect leave within 24 hr . For enrolled control group , patient discharge hospital , get medication dispense RXPartners traditional pill bottle . They continue manage medication way prior study may include take medication directly pill bottle pill-box/reminder system . Intervention group : For enrol intervention group , UPMC Health Plan work RxPartners LTC ( wholly own subsidiary UPMC ) perform medication regimen review complete `` cost '' patient expect leave within 24 hr . The medication regimen review ensure currently prescribe medication available RxPartners load dispensed EMMA medication delivery unit ( MDU ) . Only solid form medication certain size shape package require blister-packs . The cost procedure ensure insurance company allow medication fill potentially usual refill date ( i.e. , obtain new prescription previously prescribe medication already exist supply ) . We also determine research study fund sufficient cover federally-mandated collection co-pays newly dispense medication . If medication regimen review deem appropriate AND sufficient research resource pay patient 's co-pay , patient retain study . The patient ask complete EMMA Enrollment Questionnaire ensure proper communication schedule medication drop base patient 's preference . Finally , patient complete Emed appointment information reminder sheet ensure appropriate in-home follow-up follow discharge . As part previously establish medication reconciliation process use Presbyterian Hospital , final medication list fax RxPartner 's secure fax server . RxPartners dispense , blister pack , load EMMA medication delivery unit , print patient-specific medication information . Once medication load , RxPartners use exist courier system deliver EMMA MDU patient-specific medication information directly patient 's home M-F , locate predefined geographic radius within 6 hour . RxPartners also set EMMA MDU patient 's home , ensure communicate INRange Systems server use built-in wireless modem . If connect whatever reason , machine plug directly analog phone line , previously determine present . In summary , medication use project medication prescribe clinical care patient ' attend physician . The research portion use EMMA MDU specific research assessment describe proposal . All aspect proposal do clinical care . Follow-up Procedures : Within 72 hour hospital discharge , EMS Care Transition Coach visit patient ( regardless control intervention assignment ) home base time preference . The primary goal home visit reconcile patient 's medication regimen ( e.g. , pre-hospitalization post-hospitalization medication , over-the- counter medication , medication prescribe someone else patient take ) . The Medication Discrepancy Tool use research team member communicate possible problem give patient . For potential medication discrepancy , directly contact clarify medication regimen patient 's primary care provider ( PCP ) Cardiologist . The coach also confirm patient see PCP within 7 day . Additional follow-up procedure control intervention group detail : Control group : An EMS Care Transition Coach perform medication adherence safety assessment , well home-based prevention disease management common cardiac condition . Medication adherence determine control group day 1 ( along medication reconciliation ) , 45 90 ( along exit-interview ) use manual pill count procedure . If significant medication safety issue note day 45 visit , include improper storage , label , administration , non-compliance entire medication regimen , UPMC Health Plan Case Manager contact potentially intervene . At day 45 visit , EMS Care Transition Coach also conduct home-based prevention disease management common cardiac condition use material develop American Heart Association ( AHA ) Answers Heart Fact Sheets . Intervention group : At day 45 visit , EMS Care Transition Coach conduct home-based prevention disease management common cardiac condition use material develop American Heart Association ( AHA ) Answers Heart Fact Sheets . Additionally , throughout study EMMA MDU ability detect medication adherence real-time . Therefore , program EMMA MDU generate alert email UPMC Health Plan Case Manager assign patient upon discharge . This different UPMC Case Manager one might see patient hospital setting . Case manager typically assign high-risk patient , enrol medication adherence problem . We operationalize medication non-adherence follow : 1 ) &lt; 80 % overall medication adherence OR 2 ) &gt; /= 2 miss dos medication . During course study , new medication need , RxPartners responsible blister-packing medication ( intervention group ) dispense traditional pill bottle , either couriering patient within 6 hour deliver non-urgent medication overnight-mail .</detailed_description>
