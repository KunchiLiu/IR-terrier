	<detailed_description>Background : Caregiver depression common follow family member 's stroke major contributor survivor 's hospital readmission institutionalization . Researchers consistently find intervention help caregiver resolve problem effective reduce depressive symptom . However , problem-solving intervention underused practice involve multiple , in-person telephone session require large amount staff time implement . To overcome barrier , long-term goal implement stroke caregiver program involve low-cost intervention sustainable routine clinical practice . The immediate objective test , use randomize controlled trial , problem-solving intervention stroke caregiver deliver shortly Veterans ' in-patient stay follow online , in-home session . The investigator modify traditional , problem-solving intervention add web-based training use interactive module , factsheets , tool previously develop nationally available RESCUE Caregiver website ( www.cidrr8.research.va.gov/rescue ) . The investigator also provide on-line , skill train application problem-solving approach via RESCUE message center , secure site behind VA firewall . This work build team 's extensive experience stroke caregiver education . The immediate , primary aim ( # 1 ) test effect intervention stroke caregiver ' depressive symptom 11 19 week baseline data collection . Primary Hypothesis : Stroke caregiver receive intervention less depressive symptom 11 19 week baseline data collection compare stroke caregiver receive standard care . The investigator propose four secondary aim . Aim # 2 test effect intervention stroke caregiver ' burden , positive aspect caregiving , self-efficacy , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , satisfaction care 11 19 week baseline data collection . Aim # 3 test effect intervention Veterans ' outcome : functional ability healthcare utilization ( i.e. , unintended hospital bed day care , number emergency room visit , number unscheduled clinic visit ) 11 19 week baseline data collection . Aim # 4 determine budgetary impact implement intervention . Aim # 5 determine facilitator , barrier best practice implement intervention . Methods : The investigator conduct two-group randomized control trial repeat measure use mixed method determine caregiver ' perception intervention . The investigator enroll 240 stroke caregiver 5 study site ( North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Healthcare System , Miami VA Healthcare System , James A. Haley Veterans Hospital Tampa , Richmond VA Medical Center Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center Houston ) . Eligible caregiver interview , complete baseline measure , randomize two group : 1 ) intervention group , 2 ) standard care . A study team member telephone caregiver 11 week 19 week baseline data collection answer question instrument establish reliability validity . The team member review Veterans ' VA Computerized Patient Record System health record obtain information Veterans ' healthcare utilization . The investigator determine budgetary impact intervention examine cost data VA Managerial Cost Accounting System ( MCAS ) ( formerly DSS ) National Data Extracts Non-VA Medical Care file . Qualitative interview conduct selected caregiver obtain in-depth perception value , facilitator , barrier intervention . Throughout phase project , investigator collaborate VA ( Offices Nursing Service Office Geriatrics Extended Care . Impact : This first know study test transition-to-home intervention combine technology improve quality caregiving recovery Veterans . Other outcomes state-of-the-art website evidence-based model ( in-patient , discharge planning online , train caregiver-provider messaging ) transportable disease model</detailed_description>
