	<brief_title>Resection vs. Best Supportive Care Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) With Portal Venous Thrombus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances surgical technique make possible remove macroscopic tumor hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient portal venous thrombus ( PVTT ) . However , benefit surgery remain largely controversial . On one hand , many clinician believe surgical resection offer chance long term survival . Many study report median survival 6-40 month liver resection thrombectomy , case achieve long term survival.On hand , strength evidence arise study widely question retrospective nature study design . Most single arm cohort study . A study use control group consist patient unresectable HCC PVTT underwent transarterial chemoembolization . This lead obvious selection bias . Because patient unresectable HCC PVTT much poor prognosis compare resectable disease widespread tumor focus less residual liver , even baseline character comparable .</detailed_description>
