	<brief_summary>Proton beam radiation therapy know spare surround normal tissue radiation . Proton beam radiation delivers le radiation beyond area target tissue . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience standard ( photon ) radiation therapy tend unavoidably include normal tissue along tumor target tissue . In research study , investigator look determine proton beam radiation effective control cancer growth . The investigator also look see proton beam radiation reduce side effect compare standard radiation treatment ( photon radiation ) .</brief_summary>
