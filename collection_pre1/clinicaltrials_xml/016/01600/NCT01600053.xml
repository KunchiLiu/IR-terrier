	<brief_title>Revlimid® Consolidation Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLL prevalent leukemia western world consider incurable . Standard therapy CLL typically form purine analog , alkylating agent , monoclonal antibody , combination drug . Unfortunately , despite high response rate treatment strategy consider palliative patient eventually experience disease relapse time become less responsive therapy . Following standard treatment , CLL patient often fail achieve complete response , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) marrow often correlate short time progression next therapy . The National California Institute Working Group newly update International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Working Group definition complete response ( CR ) CLL quite permissive allows persistence 30 % residual lymphocytes marrow . These response criterion initially develop time treatment option CLL patient limit relatively CRs obtain . However , therapeutic advance include monoclonal antibody stem cell transplant reduce residual CLL cell great extent previously possible necessitated update current response criterion include MRD evaluation development highly sensitive assay measure MRD multiparametric 4-color flow cytometry , allele-specific PCR , convenient investigational assay peripheral blood level CLLU-1 . Regardless , majority complete response achieve follow initial therapy still detectable residual disease . Importantly , CLL patient lack minimal residual disease follow treatment consistently demonstrate prolonged progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) compare persistent MRD . As , development therapeutic strategy potential eradicate disease therapy highly desire . Such consolidation therapy potential improve depth remission , prolong PFS , potentially overall survival CLL patient . The investigator propose Revlimid might one therapy use consolidation eradicate residual disease improve remission patient receive therapy might lead prolonged disease free duration . The investigator hypothesize Revlimid safe well tolerated setting . The investigator hypothesize Revlimid consolidation might effective CLL patient risk early relapse patient leukemia cell use unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region . The investigator find relative CLLU1 expression level blood sample mirror residual level CLL cell determine 4-color flow cytometry cell aspirate marrow . The investigator hypothesize monitor expression CLLU1 might provide reliable mean evaluate residual disease context Revlimid consolidation therapy . Previous single agent Revlimid study suggest Revlimid treatment CLL patient may positively impact immune parameter increase relative composition T-lymphocytes , modulation cytokine , lead improvement immunoglobulin level development leukemia specific antibody , investigator hypothesize similar change immune parameter may occur context Revlimid consolidation therapy .</detailed_description>
