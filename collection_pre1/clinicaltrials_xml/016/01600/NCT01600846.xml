	<detailed_description>This study aim assess two delivery model PGx test ( physician-initiated pharmacist-initiated ) commonly prescribe drug primary care practice evaluate delivery test three perspective : physician , patient , practice set . We hypothesize great utilization influence increased physician knowledge awareness drug PGx testing , comfort discuss PGx test patient apply result therapeutic decision-making positive attitude towards test process . We hypothesize pharmacist-initiated approach result effective use rapid uptake PGx test give hands-on educational approach pharmacist provide expert guidance . We also hypothesize pharmacist PGx test expertise part medical team result great physician comfort test order application result compare physician-initiated model . In addition , economic analysis conduct evaluate compare cost model . We also examine patient perspective PGx test utilization test result . We hypothesize patient experienced adverse response poor drug outcome ( response ) past , take chronic medication , older likely consent PGx test . We hypothesize patient ' increased awareness genetic predisposition adverse response result great discussion prescribe physician pharmacist PGx result new treatment prescribe , great attention adverse effect new drug potentially great medication compliance . We implement evaluate two delivery model PGx test primary care practice : physician-initiated test pharmacist-initiated testing . Each practice provide educational intervention survey prior seminar follow intervention period ass primary care practitioner ( PCP ) knowledge attitude PGx test . These survey take 10-15 minute complete available online system like SurveyMonkey . In pharmacist-initiated group , pharmacist base within practice identify prescribe drug available PGx test chart review provide specific information recommendation PGx test order physician . In physician-initiated group , physicians order test deem necessary , also on-call pharmacist support consult . Patients offer PGx test also survey : decide whether pursue PGx testing , consent testing , receive test result . These survey take 10-15 minute complete paper ( pretest ) online system like SurveyMonkey ( post-test ) . The pretest survey 3 section : demographic , perceive risk benefit PGx testing , satisfaction test result . The post-test assess information-seeking behavior , medication adherence , knowledge adverse drug reaction . Chart review conduct throughout study collect various data-points . All extract data-points cod ; key stored separate file minimize breach privacy . In summary , medical record patient schedule see either clinic first second phase study ( see Figure 1 ) review identify patient prescribe drug Table 1 . A post-intervention ( third final phase study ) chart review conduct monitor number new prescription drug list Table 1 , frequency PGx testing order , physician , drug . We conduct chart review end phase study ( pre-intervention period , intervention period , post intervention period ) patient prescribe targeted medication . No HIPAA ( Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ) identifier record . All PCPs practice two clinic involve study eligible participate . All physician participate educational intervention either arm invite participate pre post-intervention survey . The patient survey population include patient offer consent declined testing . All patient 18 year old prescribe drug PGx test available offer PGx test physician intervention period ask participate initial survey . Patients must English-speaking able complete survey without assistance . Chart review include patient schedule appointment either clinic within design study period . Data abstract ( full chart review ) limit patient prescribed target drug designate period .</detailed_description>
