	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety TMC207 Patients With Pulmonary Infection With Multi-drug Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign chance study treatment ) , double-blind ( individual investigator know identity study treatment ) , placebo ( substance contain active medication ) -controlled , 2-arm study patient sputum smear-positive pulmonary infection multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) define tuberculosis ( TB ) due infection strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) resistant isoniazid rifampin , pre-extensively drug resistant ( pre-XDR-TB ) define TB due infection MDR strain M. tuberculosis resistant either least one injectable second-line drug [ amikacin , kanamycin , capreomycin ] fluoroquinolone , ) . Approximately 600 patient sputum smear-positive pulmonary infection MDR-TB pre-XDR TB receive background regimen ( BR ) MDR-TB therapy randomly assign 1:1 ratio one 2 treatment arm ( Arms A [ TMC207 + BR ] B [ placebo + BR ] ) . All patient receive TMC207 placebo combination BR MDR-TB therapy . TMC207 ( match placebo ) take oral tablet daily dose 400 mg first 2 week 200 mg 3 times/week remain period TMC207 ( match placebo ) administration . The study consist screen phase maximum 3 week , 36-week double-blind treatment phase , follow 48-week follow-up phase Week 84 , also refer treatment-free follow-up . After treatment-free follow-up phase , safety follow-up phase 48 week Week 132 . Patients Arms A B fail treatment accord prespecified criterion give option receive 24 week TMC207 plus individualized salvage regimen take duration consistent national TB guideline . Efficacy pharmacokinetic evaluation perform time point detail protocol . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
