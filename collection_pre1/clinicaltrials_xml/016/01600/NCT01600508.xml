	<brief_summary>Background : Videoconference ( VC ) common clinical tool huge potential alter medical practice offer patient best expertise treatment follow-up spite long distance , especially rural area . Studies upon select patient group show VC safe cost-effective . However , RCT VC patient stoma problem never perform . Patients stoma problem resource demand patient . The University Hospital North Norway ( UNN ) several hundred consultation patient group year , serve population North Norway . Methods : In randomise control trial ( RCT ) , patient either randomised VC consultation regular consultation outpatient clinic . All patient stoma need special attention eligible inclusion . Patients randomise VC group , set-up meeting near VC studio locate home community . There educate VC- stoma nurse participate clinical examination hospital outpatient clinic rural VC studio . Endpoints : Primary endpoint patient satisfaction quality life . Secondary endpoint number consultation cost effectiveness . Sample size calculation show 170 patient include trial . The investigator hypothesize postoperative follow-up stoma patient VC impact patient ' quality life compare Hospital outpatient follow-up . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize incremental cost-effectiveness ratio improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There substantial development use VC among medical personnel [ 1 ] . Therefore , new application VC emerge , surgical telementoring , trauma emergency medicine , postoperative follow-up patient , education medical personnel , multidisciplinary team meeting [ 2 ] . VC great unused potential , recently describe `` invited commentary '' World Journal Surgery [ 3 ] . Furthermore , recent year , cost VC equipment become less expensive , advanced technical skill require use system . Patients stoma problem large resource demand group . Each year perform several hundred consultation surgical outpatient clinic University Hospital North-Norway patient group . These patient surgically treat gastrointestinal , urological gynaecological department . The visual component critical give patient stoma problem best care , VC therefore well suited patient group [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , infrastructure VC northern Norway well develop VC . In county Finnmark , Troms Nordland VC network , link together Norwegian Health Network . The purpose study obtain insight quality life ( QoL ) among patient follow hospital outpatient set VC , incremental cost-effectiveness ratio point view health care society . Methods design Study design This study randomize control trial patient either randomize follow surgical outpatient clinic ( control group ) VC ( intervention group Participants Patients ( inclusion exclusion criterion 's ) Medical doctor Stoma nurse Intervention Patients randomize follow-up either VC ( intervention ) surgical outpatient clinic . All patient receive first postoperative check-up hospital . A clinical examination perform information RCT give . If patient give informed consent , randomization perform . Patients randomized VC follow-up refer GP local VC stoma nurse . Control arm Patients control group consist patient randomized regular follow-up hospital 's surgical outpatient clinic . This follow-up performed consultant digestive surgery , specially educate stoma nurse . QOL questionnaires The EQ-5D questionnaire two-year follow-up period ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month follow-up ) give patient baseline examination . Economic evaluation questionnaire : A questionnaire develop enable calculation cost related patient examination . This questionnaire incorporate QOL questionnaire , patient request fill questionnaire 1 , 3 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month inclusion . The cost element include patient- family-related cost due outpatient visit , VC visit , laboratory test , radiographs/ultrasound , examination due stoma complication , treatment stoma complication , travel , production loss , co-payments patient expense . Control arm Patients control group consist patient randomized regular follow-up hospital 's surgical outpatient clinic . Consultants digestive surgery stoma nurse perform follow-up . Objectives Primary objective We aim compare quality life cost follow-up among patient follow VC surgical outpatient clinic . We hypothesize patient follow VC experience similar high score quality life measure low cost follow-up . Secondary objective We want establish nurse lead VC stoma school , prior clinical trial . Nurses , specially educate treat patient stoma problem , write curriculum . Five ten nurse logistic important VC community North Norway invite 10 20 hour course stoma treatment technical aspect around VC . This do prior start clinical study . Outcome measure Primary outcome ( measure 1 , 3 , 6,9,12,15,18,21 24 month ) Quality life EQ-5D standardize generic instrument use measure health outcome . Applicable wide range health condition treatment , provide simple descriptive profile single index value health status . EQ-5D measure five dimension health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) : mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain/discomfort anxiety/depression . EQ Visual Analogue Scale : The EQ VAS record respondent 's self-rated health status vertically graduate ( 0-100 ) visual analogue scale [ 6 ] . Economic analysis A cost-effectiveness analysis perform alongside randomize control trial . A Markov model employ . If trial reveals difference health outcome quality life patient , cost-minimization analysis carry . If reveal difference quality life two group , implement cost-utility analysis . The economic evaluation health care societal perspective . Resources use treatment arm register prospectively base report patient hospital patient record . Costs related consultation primary secondary care level , baseline 24 month randomization , include direct medical cost , indirect cost ( production loss ) , travel cost patient-/family-related cost register . Quality life measurement collect baseline several time point intervention . A 3 % discount rate use discount future cost benefit . The cost element include cost related outpatient visit , GP visit , laboratory test , radiograph ultrasound , examination due suspect stoma complication , treatment stoma complication , traveling/transportation , production loss , co-payments patient/family expense . The net cost outcomes two treatment option compare presented incremental cost-effectiveness ratio . Sample size Sample size calculation accord Campbell 's [ 7 ] EQ-5D guideline [ 8 ] . Alpha beta set 0.05 0.2 respectively tests two-sided . We hypothesize patient follow VC minor moderate increase QoL score . Allowing dropout rate 20 % , detect difference confidence require total sample size 170 patient . Randomization Randomization do 1-month check-up ( baseline ) patient give informed consent . The randomization service web-based manage Norwegian University Science Technology . Patients allocate VC follow-up may refer back surgical clinic point study . Data gathering Data collect patient intervention control group identical way . QoL `` cost questionnaire '' send follow-up appointment patient trial center 24 month postoperatively . These questionnaire optically readable , data consecutively collect trial database . SCEs register via hospital chart review 24 month postoperatively . The Norwegian Data Inspectorate approve study . All data handle strict confidentiality , study report presentation maintain anonymity patient , surgeon , GPs hospital . Data collection complete end 2013 . Analysis We use intention-to-treat principle analyze data . Treatment arm compare respect potential covariates use continuous categorical univariable analysis . These include variable relate patient ( age , sex , comorbidities , cost ) , treatment ( surgical resection , surgical complication ) , hospital surgical outpatient clinic ( cost , patient satisfaction , QoL ) , VC consultation ( cost , patient satisfaction , QoL ) . The cost element include cost related outpatient visit , VC visit , laboratory test , radiographs/ultrasound , examination due suspect complication , treatment complication , traveling/transportation , production loss , co-payments patient expense . The net cost outcomes two treatment/follow-up option compare present cost-effectiveness ratio . If trial reveals difference health outcome quality life patient , cost-minimization analysis carry . If find difference quality life overall survival rate two group , use cost utility approach . The economic evaluation societal health care perspective . The method analysis , include adjust covariates comply CONSORT statement [ 9 ] . The result express odds ratio binary outcome , hazard ratio time- to-event outcome mean difference continuous outcome correspond standard error , 95 % confidence interval , associate p-values . P-values report three decimal place p-values le 0.001 report p &lt; 0.001 . For test use alpha = 0.05 level significance . Ethics The Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics , North Norway approve protocol . Patients must provide write consent enter trial . Discussion VC use instrument follow-up patient postoperative period outpatient consultation . From hospital , extensive experience use VC follow-up haemodialysis patient [ 10 ] dermatology [ 11 , 12 ] . In addition , new project start orthopaedic department , VC line establish University Hospital district medical centre Nordreisa , 155 mile away . In project , outpatient patient postoperative patient examine district orthopaedic nurse supervision orthopaedic consultant locate University Hospital . This project organize randomise controlled trial , primary endpoint cost-effectiveness patient satisfaction . Several article report use VC follow-up surgical patient . Wallace et al . aim compare joint VC general practitioner , specialist ( surgeon ) , patient standard outpatient referral . This randomise control trial show allocation patient virtual outreach consultation variably associate increased offer follow-up appointment accord site specialty , lead significant increase patient ' satisfaction substantial reduction test investigation . Efficient operation service require appropriate selection patient , significant service reorganization , provision logistical support [ 13 ] . A study Finland investigate use VC examination orthopaedic outpatient . VC find feasible equipment function well technically . The conclusion VC primary secondary care could use examination orthopaedic patient whenever demand image technology need [ 14 ] Whether VC cost-effective follow-up surgical patient debate . The clinical effectiveness cost VC orthopaedics primary secondary care examine eight-month prospective comparative study . The general surgery outpatient clinic two Finnish district hospital compare . The direct cost outpatient visit 45 % great per patient VC . A cost-minimization analysis alternative intervention show net benefit EU 2,500 favour VC [ 15 ] . Another Finnish study similar result . Wider utilization VC equipment purpose , use less expensive VC equipment , would make service cost save even relatively short distance [ 16 ] . VC use almost medical specialty , although specialty best suit high visual component . Wound heal wound management thus prime candidate VC follow-up . Development suitable telemedical system field could significant effect wound care community , tertiary referral pattern , hospital admission rate [ 5 , 17 ] .</detailed_description>
