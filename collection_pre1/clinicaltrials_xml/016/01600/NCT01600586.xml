	<brief_summary>NICU infant high risk oromotor difficulty include poor coordination suck swallow breathing . These feed difficulty often result prolonged hospitalization , increase physiologic stressor poor growth . In preliminary study , Pacifier Activated Lullaby ( PAL ) use show potential increase oromotor skill decrease length hospitalization . The investigator propose test hypothesis week-long PAL intervention improve feed skill decrease stress compare standard care parental interaction infant late preterm period . The investigator also hypothesize improvement result short hospital stay increase growth intervention group . Our study design prospective randomize controlled trial design 94 NICU infant ( Post-conceptional age 34-36 week ) Vanderbilt NICU . The 47 intervention-group infant/mother dad receive book library one lullaby book record voice PAL , music therapist administer 15-minute session 5 consecutive day . The 47 participant control group receive library recording make PAL use . Outcomes measured include time full oral feed , suck rate efficiency , salivary cortisol level intervention , daily growth parameter nutritional data , hospital length stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : We conduct randomized trial test hypothesis mother 's voice play pacifier-activated music ( PAM ) player nonnutritive sucking would improve development suck ability promote effective oral feed preterm infant . Methods : Preterm infants 34 0/7 35 6/7 week postmenstrual age , include brain injury , take least half feeding enterally less half orally , randomly assign receive 5 daily 15-minute session either PAM mother 's recorded voice PAM , along routine nonnutritive suck maternal care group . Assignment mask clinical team . Results : Ninety-four infant , ( 46 48 PAM intervention control group , respectively ) complete study . The intervention group significantly increase oral feeding rate ( 2.0 vs. 0.9 ml/min , p &lt; 0.001 ) , oral volume intake ( 91.1 vs. 48.1 ml/kg/d , p = 0.001 ) , oral feeds/day ( 6.5 vs. 4 p &lt; 0.001 ) , faster-time-to-full oral feeding ( 31 vs. 38 , p = 0.04 compare control . Weight gain cortisol level 5-day protocol different group . Average hospital stay 20 % short PAM group , difference significant ( p = 0.07 ) . Conclusion : A PAM use mother 's voice improve oral feed skill preterm infant without adverse effect hormonal stress growth .</detailed_description>
