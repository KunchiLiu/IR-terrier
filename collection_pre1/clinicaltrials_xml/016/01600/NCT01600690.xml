	<detailed_description>Statins commonly prescribe low cardiovascular risk primary secondary prevention . Despite well know efficacy relatively low NNTs , statin withdrawal common event several reason . Patients often stop statin therapy long short period time . Even short term statin withdrawal dramatic consequence atherosclerotic plaque stability , owe rebound cholesterol level inflammation . Previous study demonstrate worsen inflammation endothelial function short-term statin withdrawal . This may even dramatic patient increase risk cardiovascular disease , diabetic patient . Endothelial integrity accomplish contribution circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) repair damage endothelial layer contribute cardiovascular health general . EPC stimulate statin , data effect statin withdrawal EPCs . One important aspect inflammation pro- versus anti-inflammatory polarization circulate monocyte/macrophage ( MM ) cell . Schematically , MM exist 2 different state activation : classically activate pro-inflammatory cell ( M1 ) alternatively activate anti-inflammatory cell ( M2 ) . The balance 2 ( M1/M2 ratio ) reflect state MM polarization . The effect statin withdrawal MM polarization unknown . In study , explore effect 5-day statin withdrawal EPC monocyte/macrophage polarization , together inflammatory biomarkers ( namely high sensitive C-reactive protein ) type 2 diabetic patient . We hypothesise statin withdrawal determines reduction EPC level inflammatory cell polarization . Patients randomize continue habitual statin regimen withdraw statin . At baseline 5 day later , blood sample collect experimental measure ( EPC , M1 , M2 hsCRP ) .</detailed_description>
