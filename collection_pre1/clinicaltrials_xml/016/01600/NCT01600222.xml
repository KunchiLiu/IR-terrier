	<brief_summary>A Phase 2 Maximal Use Systemic Exposure ( MUSE ) study evaluate safety efficacy LEO 90100 use daily subject extensive psoriasis vulgaris .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect LEO 90100 HPA Axis Calcium Metabolism Subjects With Extensive Psoriasis VulgarisExtensive Psoriasis Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose present study assess systemic safety LEO 90100 . Although LEO 90100 contains active ingredient concentration DAIVOBET/DOVOBET/TACLONEX ointment , degree absorption active ingredient new formulation may differ . Systemic safety assess effect LEO 90100 calcium metabolism HPA axis function maximum use condition ( i.e. , subject extensive psoriasis trunk , limbs scalp , use 120g per week LEO 90100 4 week ) . Data study , together measurement albumin-corrected serum calcium calcium : creatinine ratio spot urine sample plan phase 2 3 study development program LEO 90100 , expect provide adequate information respect systemic safety LEO 90100 .</detailed_description>
