	<brief_title>A Trial Cabazitaxel Advanced Transitional Cell Carcinoma ( TCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient advanced bladder cancer progress platinum base regimen , widely accept standard second line therapy currently exist . Taxanes include paclitaxel docetaxel exhibit limited clinical activity disease sometimes give study . Cabazitaxel novel semi-synthetic taxane low affinity multidrug resistance 1 protein . In cell line cabazitaxel potent docetaxel , tumor cell resistant taxanes , cabazitaxel overcome taxanes resistance . In recent clinical data , drug show potent activity patient metastatic prostate cancer resistant docetaxel . Based phase III data , cabazitaxel recently approve US , Europe Israel patient . The main toxicity taxane neutropenia diarrhea , thus primary prevention GCSF may reduce main toxicity agent . In phase II multicenter study , investigator aim evaluate efficacy tolerability novel taxane -cabazitaxel single agent second-line chemotherapy metastatic urothelial carcinoma failure prior platinum-based chemotherapy . The patient plan receive cabazitaxel start dose 25 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously 1 h , follow premedication accept cabazitaxel . Treatment cycle every 3 week . All patient receive primary GCSF support .</detailed_description>
