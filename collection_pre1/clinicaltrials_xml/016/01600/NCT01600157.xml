	<brief_summary>Background Fast-track concept reduce hospital stay 15-20 day three day patient underwent colon resection [ 1-5 ] . A well-designed pilot study determine efficacy fast-track program laparoscopic radical nephrectomy , fast-track group discharge earlier recovery room median ( 74+/-23 v 103+/-47 minute ) well hospital median ( 41+/-11 v 59+/-11 hour ) [ 6 ] . Implementation principles fast-track program shorten postoperative hospital stay eight four day patient underwent open radical nephrectomy [ 7 ] . Taek-Gu Lee et al . document early mobilization colon surgery result reduced recovery time without increased complication [ 8 ] . Laparoscopic surgery minimal invasive less surgical stress , morbidity mortality [ 9 ] . The use laparoscopic nephrectomy Denmark reduce hospital stay 5.2 day meet foreign country outcome [ 06 ] . Therefore combination advantage laparoscopic surgery fast-track concept could use nephrectomy . However , prospective study describe course nephrectomy , advantage exploit important make basic study describe understand factor surgical outcome . Aim study To describe postoperative period laparoscopic trans-peritoneal nephrectomy perform ambulatory procedure . Method A prospective study involve 62 patient diagnosed Cancer Renis DC649 . All patient receive result CT-scanning outpatient meet inclusion criterion study inform study receive write information accord appendix 1. , new time ( NA ) get result kidney function oral information study well acceptation connect study , patient receive standard recommendation discharge hospital day operation restart normal activity day operation unless prevent factor . All patient thoroughly informed examiner complete questionnaire come different test accord appendix 2. , blood test take accord appendix 12 . All patient CT-scanning abdomen , chest X-ray kidney function test operation . Statistic The number patient , decide include study , base realize number nephrectomy operation do specified period within department statistic power study . The Scheff√© 's test use multiple comparison . The correlation variable evaluate use Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . P value less 0.05 consider significant . Statistical analysis perform SPSS statistic program software . Publications The result study , irrespective whether positive negative , publish international scientific journal distribute relative conference . The published article Azawi NH first author , Christensen T last author co-authors accord Vancouver rule . Ethics The study report Danish National Committee Biomedical Research Ethics regionsjaelland paraplygodtkendelsen data control , Ph.D. student ( NA ) apply enrollment PhD programme University Copenhagen .
