	<brief_summary>Patients chronic liver disease high risk develop liver scar ( fibrosis ) , ultimate risk cirrhosis liver cancer may require liver transplant . The investigator would like develop non invasive advance Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) technique ( MR diffusion , perfusion elastography ) ass degree liver damage patient chronic liver disease . These technique combine could reach high diagnostic performance detection liver fibrosis ; could decrease number liver biopsy , risk sample small portion liver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Liver Fibrosis With Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic hepatitis increase risk liver damage , include fibrosis cirrhosis , may eventually lead hepatocellular carcinoma end-stage liver disease require liver transplantation . These disease are/will source enormous health care cost morbidity/mortality US . Most hepatologists still rely liver biopsy finding patient newly diagnose chronic hepatitis , enable assessment liver damage ( fibrosis inflammation ) . Liver biopsy limitation , include cost , invasiveness , poor patient acceptance , limited sampling , inter-observer variability difficult repeat . Non invasive test capture extent liver damage large scale urgently need . These gain acceptance among patient hepatologists . In proposal , investigator would like test validate non invasive MRI method base advanced MR diffusion , perfusion elastography technique detection fibrosis cirrhosis patient chronic hepatitis . In order improve diagnostic performance MRI , investigator would like build validate predictive model base advanced functional MRI metric ( diffusion , perfusion elastography ) . If validate , novel non invasive algorithm decrease number liver biopsy , also enable early diagnosis liver fibrosis antiviral treatment effective , enable comprehensive evaluation liver ( assess cirrhosis , portal hypertension hepatocellular cancer ) . This could significantly reduce cost care , could become useful tool test new antifibrogenic antiviral drug chronic viral hepatitis , could use follow patient detection progression cirrhosis .</detailed_description>
