	<brief_summary>The investigator recently develop innovative optical molecular image platform ( call PRODIGI ) base high-resolution fluorescence white-light technology hand-held , real-time , high-resolution , non-invasive format . PRODIGI offer non-contact mean obtain instantaneous image-based measurement diagnostically-relevant biological molecular information wound surround skin tissue first time could significant impact improve conventional wound care , management , guidance intervention . In preliminary preclinical testing , investigator discover wound illuminated violet/blue light , endogenous collagen connective tissue matrix emit characteristic green fluorescent signal , pathogenic bacterial specie emit unique red fluorescence signal due production endogenous porphyrin . Therefore , autofluorescence imaging , exogenous contrast agent need imaging , make approach particularly appeal diagnostic imaging method clinical use . Based extensive preclinical study labs , PRODIGI demonstrate capability collect autofluorescence image wound detect presence relative change connective tissue ( e.g . collagen ) content bio-distribution involve wound heal . It also detect presence relative amount commensal pathogenic bacteria within wound base autofluorescence alone ( bacteria invisible standard visualization naked eye use white light ) , thus provide measure infection status . This could significantly impact clinical wound care management ) reduce complication associate missed detection bacterial infection conventional practice , ii ) facilitate image-guided wound sampling target swabbing/biopsy iii ) monitoring wound heal treatment response time . Previous Related Studies : A pilot-level clinical study ( UHN REB protocol # 09-0015-A , PI : DaCosta , 50 patient imaged date ) perform group 2008-2011 ass clinical utility device successfully demonstrate tissue autofluorescence produce endogenous collagen/elastin skin appear green fluorescent image , clinically-relevant bacterial colony present wound produce red fluorescence signal cause endogenous porphyrin . Some bacterial specie ( e.g . pseudomonas aeruginosa ) produce green fluorescence signal differentiate spectrally texturally fluorescence dermis ( another hue green , discernable proprietary image analysis software ) . The PRODIGI device sensitive enough detect green red fluorescence signal tissue bacteria confirm utility compact portable image platform clinical wound care . The investigator hypothesize real-time imaging tissue autofluorescence signal emanate endogenous connective tissue ( e.g . collagen ) pathogenic bacteria within complex wound use determine heal status ( i.e. , collagen re-modeling wound closure ) , detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection occult standard clinical white light evaluation , guide intervention wound care .</brief_summary>
