	<detailed_description>Resilience , ability cope effectively adapt wide range stressful environmental challenge , appear mediate extensively medial prefrontal cortex ( MPFC ) . Sleep deprivation show reduce metabolic activity throughout brain , particularly MPFC . The ability resist effect sleep loss appear stable , trait-like phenomenon consistent across situation , suggest may reflect endure quality underlie neurobiological system . The present study aim identify neural basis resilience effectively discriminate resistant vulnerable individual overnight sleep deprivation session . Specifically , primary aim research 1 ) understand role MPFC resilience 2 ) develop statistical prediction algorithm base multimodal neuroimaging reliably discriminate individual resilient versus vulnerable cognitive impairing effect sleep loss .</detailed_description>
