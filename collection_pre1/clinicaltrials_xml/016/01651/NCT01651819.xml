	<brief_title>Urological Physical Therapy HTLV-1 With Urinary Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) human retrovirus prove main agent acute T cell lymphoma/leukemia ( ATLL ) progressive neurological disease call HTLV-1 associate myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . The HTLV-1 first isolate 1980 endemic Japan , Caribbean , Africa South America . It estimate 20 million people infected worldwide . In Brazil present state variable prevalence . The factor associate HTLV-1 transmission Brazil relate social demographic condition , characterized rural exodus increase urban population coast area . Several study base Brazil report epicenter HTLV-1 infection Bahia , Maranh√£o Pernambuco high prevalence 1,8 % Salvador , Bahia capital . The urinary incontinence bladder-sphincter disturbance often find HTLV-1 patient . In infection common pathology find overactive bladder syndrome due detrusor overactivity sphincter-detrusor dyssynergia symptom urgency , nocturia incontinence . This disable disease associate psychosocial issue like loss self confidence , social isolation reduce quality life . The physical therapy treatment objective promote social adequacy reestablish bladder function . It base resource like : bladder reeducation , biofeedback , kinesiotherapy pelvic wall , utilization vaginal cone electrostimulation . Those associate anticholinergic drug bladder catheterization . The need urologic gynecologic physical therapy follow patient HTLV-1 neurogenic bladder important reduce disability , preserve pelvic muscle renal function .</detailed_description>
