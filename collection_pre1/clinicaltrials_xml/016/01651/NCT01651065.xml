	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize trial study efficacy novel social propagation intervention integrate social network induction health education weight metabolic control among patient type 2 diabetes , BMI 25-30+ , cardiovascular disease . The intervention take place form community health program , participant enroll program ask would like take part study evaluate efficacy . Thus , investigator study efficacy social network propagate change lifestyle factor diabetes chronic disease management</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The potential harness propagate power social network chronic disease treatment management , diabetes obesity , emerge area epidemiology clinical research . Social induction disease management effectively leverage disease management , carefully disaggregated different layer modality social network effect context . This study test demonstrate novel randomize trial . The randomized design comprise 2 arm . 1 ) Intervention Group : This arm take part 10-month ( 9-month Phase 2 , cycle 1 2 ) diabetes , weight , cardiovascular disease education management program combination microclinic social support model . A microclinic support group 2-6 individual social network learn manage disease together . 2 ) Control Group : This control arm observational parallel assessment metabolic lifestyle risk factor alone ( implemented Phase 1 2 , cycle 1 2 ) . Each arm take part 6-month follow-up . The investigator also aim study intervention effect social network improve lifestyle risk factor small sample Phase 1 control repeat measure design . Observational control 7 repeated measure Phase 1 ( pre-intervention ) receive 9-month diabetes , weight , cardiovascular disease education management program microclinic social support model condense 4-6 month program . The control cycle also receive 17 medical screening intervention , 6-month follow-up ( post-intervention ) . Aim 1- ( Phase 1 2 , Cycles 1 &amp; 2 ) To evaluate efficacy microclinic intervention group versus observational control improve lifestyle factor metabolic outcome . Aim 2— ( Phase 2 , Cycle 3 ) To examine effect microclinic intervention compare pre- post measure among first control Phase 1 participate microclinic intervention Phase 2 , Cycle 3 . AIM 3— ( Phases 1 &amp; 2 , cycle 1 , 2 , 3 ) To differentiate modality social network effect : direct causal induction versus homophilly , determine extent long-term temporal cross-propagating effect between-persons microclinic group .</detailed_description>
