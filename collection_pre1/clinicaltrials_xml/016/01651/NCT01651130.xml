	<brief_summary>Post-partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) major cause maternal death worldwide . Oxytocin common uterotonic drug use prevent treat PPH North America , however , limitation use . Oxytocin short duration action , require continuous infusion achieve sustain uterotonic activity . The Society Obstetricians Gynecologists Canada ( SOGC ) recently recommend single 100mcg dose carbetocin elective Cesarean delivery promote uterine contraction prevent post partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) , lieu traditional oxytocin regimen . Carbetocin last 4 7 time longer oxytocin , similar side effect profile apparent great efficacy rate . However , dose response study determine minimum effective dose carbetocin yet publish . The investigator hypothesize minimum effective dose ( ED90 ) least 20mcgs ( perhaps ) woman undergo elective Cesarean delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Society Obstetricians Gynecologists Canada ( SOGC ) recently recommend 100mcg intravenous bolus dose carbetocin follow Cesarean delivery . Studies thus far show carbetocin may effective oxytocin promote uterine contraction , similar side effect profile . In addition , patient receive carbetocin may experience less blood loss , require less additional uterotonics compare oxytocin . Two dose response study conduct institution ( Cordovani et al , Anandakrishnan et al ) suggest difference efficacy uterine contraction dos carbetocin 20-120mcg . Hypotension note dose group study . This study conduct prospective , randomize , up-down sequential allocation trial . The success fail patient study determine dose give future patient . Dosage increase patient follow failed case , keep patient follow successful case . Following successful case , also 1 9 chance dose decrease next patient . The result follow-up study define minimum require dose carbetocin uterine contraction , thus minimize unnecessary side effect , improve quality safety patient care . It may also contribute establish carbetocin substitute oxytocin elective cesarean section institution well others .</detailed_description>
