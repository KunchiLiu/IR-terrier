	<brief_summary>Increasing exposure single orosensory cue without ingestion additional energy may promote increased rate habituation , rapid satiation , reduce intake . This exposure occur via smell ( olfactory ) taste ( gustatory ) systems.It clear repeat exposure via combined olfactory gustatory system increase rate habituation repeat exposure one system . Thus , purpose investigation examine amount salivation occur 12 trial exposure food via olfactory , gustatory , combine olfactory gustatory system . The primary dependent variable amount salivation 12 trial . It hypothesize rapid decrease salivation occur across trial combine olfactory gustatory exposure compare two condition , indicate rapid rate habituation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeated Food Exposure Via Olfactory Gustatory Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately two every three adult U.S. overweight obese . The high prevalence overweight/obesity negatively affect health population , obese individual increase risk develop several chronic disease . Successful control body weight depend effectively regulate eat . Satiation , process eat bout end , assist eat regulation , factor quicken onset satiation may aid decrease intake . One factor believe influence satiation rate decrease consummatory response ( habituation ) repeat presentation food orosensory cue . Habituation basic form learning , behavioral physiological response decrease response repeat presentation stimulus , decrease response unrelated sensory adaptation/fatigue motor fatigue . In one condition , participant smell lemon lime across 12 trial ( olfactory exposure ) , another condition participant taste juice across 12 trial ( gustatory exposure ) , last condition participant smell taste juice across 12 trial ( olfactory + gustatory exposure ) . The primary dependent variable amount salivation 12 trial . It hypothesize rapid decrease salivation occur across trial combine olfactory gustatory exposure compare two condition , indicate rapid rate habituation</detailed_description>
