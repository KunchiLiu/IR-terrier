	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : - To compare participation rate faecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) , compute tomographic colonography ( CTC ) colonoscopy ( CO ) primary screen test population-based programme colorectal cancer . - To compare participation rate CTC reduce cathartic preparation versus CTC standard bowel preparation . - To compare detection rate cancer advance adenomas CTC computer aid diagnosis ( CAD ) versus three round FOBT every second year . - To evaluate referral rate colonoscopy induce primary CTC versus three round FOBT every second year . - To compare cost three screen strategy . Secondary objective : - To compare expect perceived discomfort colonoscopy compute tomographic colonography assess structured questionnaire . - To evaluate rate complication group . - To validate teleradiology model compute tomographic colonography . - To create biological bank blood stool specimens subject undergo compute tomographic colonography , primary colonoscopy second level colonoscopy . DESIGN : 14,000 subject age 55-64 year , live Florence District never screen colorectal cancer , randomize 3 arm : - group 1 ( 5,000 person ) invite CTC ( divide : subgroup 1A reduce cathartic preparation subgroup 1B standard bowel preparation ) ; - group 2 ( 8,000 person ) invite biannual FOBT 3 round ; - group 3 ( 1,000 person ) invite CO . Subjects group invite mail undergo select test . Individuals group receive invitation letter information leaflet , contain information colorectal cancer , importance screening , advantage possible risk select test . Invitation letter FOBT group contain instruction pick-up kit test near pharmacy . The FOBT screen test adopt OC-SENSOR DIANA ( Eiken Chemical Co. , Tokyo , Japan ) , quantitative , completely automate immunochemical test , base latex agglutination . Positivity threshold set 100 ng/ml sample solution . Invited subject ask collect single sample faeces , without dietary restriction . Sample retuned accord routine procedure Florence screening programme . Invitation letter CTC colonoscopy contain phone number email address screen centre . All invitee option call send email screen centre order receive appointment prior consultation . All non-responders receive remainder mail three month . Non-responders reminder invite FOBT accord current screening procedure . Subjects accept invitation CTC CO consultation screen centre train nurse . During consultation subject inform study protocol , screen examination invite , bowel preparation , management case positive result . All subject test positive FOBT CTC ( mass least one polyp â‰¥ 6 mm ) invite undergo total colonoscopy . Then , subject schedule select examination ( CTC CO ) .</detailed_description>
