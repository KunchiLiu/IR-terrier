	<brief_title>Humoral Cellular Immune Responses After Influenza Vaccination Patients With Postcancer Fatigue Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background PCF frequently occur , severe , invalidate problem cancer survivor , impair quality life . The prevalence PCF observe longitudinal follow-up study range 19-39 % . Cognitive behavior therapy , especially design PCF , seem effective treatment option PCF . However , although possible effectively treat PCF , nature underlie physiology PCF remain unclear . Hypotheses mechanisms explain cancer-related fatigue already describe , include dysregulation brain serotonin , dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness , disruption circadian rhythm , alteration muscle ATP metabolism , activation vagal afferent nerve . Furthermore , presence underlying immunological problem suggest explanation PCF . Another group patient suffer severe fatigue symptom patient CFS . The estimated worldwide prevalence CFS 0.4-1 % . In Netherlands , 100.000 patient suffer chronic fatigue , 30.000 40.000 suffer CFS . In contrast fatigue patient PCF , patient CFS clear precipitating factor could identify . Also patient CFS , cognitive behavior therapy design , proven effective , pathophysiological mechanism CFS remain unclear . Hypotheses explain pathophysiological mechanism CFS include morphological metabolic alteration brain , diminished central activation muscle , altered central nervous system functioning , neuroendocrine disturbance , cognitive impairment . Furthermore , presence underlying immunological problem suggest explanation CFS . If underlying immunological problem present , PCF CFS patient might alter response vaccination . Aim Therefore , aim study compare humoral cellular immune response upon vaccination , use seasonal influenza vaccination model vaccination , PCF CFS patient , non-fatigued cancer survivor , healthy control . Research question 1 . Is humoral and/or cellular immune response influenza vaccination different fatigue patient ( PCF CFS ) non-fatigued individual ? 2 . Is humoral and/or cellular immune response influenza vaccination different PCF CFS patient ? Design The immune responses upon influenza vaccination assess 20 PCF patient 20 CFS patient . As control group PCF patient , 20 non-fatigued cancer survivor include . Additionally , 20 healthy control participate study control group without cancer history without fatigue symptom . These four group age- sex-matched . At baseline , participant complete Checklist Individual Strength , questionnaire current use medicine , questionnaire vaccination history . All participant intramuscularly vaccinate single dose seasonal influenza vaccine . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell collect baseline ( day 1 ) 7 day vaccination ( day 8 ) , serum collect baseline 21 day vaccination ( day 22 ) . Half year vaccination , participant contact check whether possible infection influenza take place meantime . The humoral immune response influenza vaccination measure day 1 day 22 serum haemagglutination-inhibition antibody test . The cellular immune response measure day 1 day 8 T lymphocyte proliferation , activation , cytokine secretion . Relevance study To best knowledge , first explore humoral cellular immune response influenza vaccination PCF CFS patient . By mean study , would like improve understand underlie physiology PCF CFS .</detailed_description>
