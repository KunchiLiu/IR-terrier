	<brief_title>Prognosis Value Neuronal Damage Early Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well admit multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) restrict white matter , also involve grey matter , either cortex deep grey matter . The progression grey matter atrophy measure MRI disease course represent interesting prognosis marker long term progression , marker lack sensitivity hard interpret individual level . In EAE animal model , early neuronal damage describe , characterize synaptic dendritic loss neuronal apoptosis . These data strongly suggest occurrence early neuronal damage MS course could represent major prognosis marker . Therefore crucial need development image technique , aim visualize quantify neuronal damage early MS. To date MRI techniques able specifically assess neuronal pathology vivo . In prospective project determine chronology appearance prognosis value neuronal damage measure PET 11C-Flumazenil , concern grey matter atrophy progression disability progression among cohort MS patient recent onset . Four group subject include : ) patient RRMS evolve since less 5 year ( revise Mc Donald criterion , n=20 ) ; ii ) patient RRMS evolve since 5 year less 10 year ( n=20 ) ; iii ) patient primary progressive MS ( PPMS ) evolve since less 10 year ( n=20 ) ; iv ) Healthy volunteer match age sex ( 2/3 match RRMS patient ; 1/3 match PPMS patient ) . Each subject pas neurologic examination , neuropsychological testing , first PET examination 11C-Flumazenil , multimodal MRI , conventional sequence ( 3DT1 , 3D T2 FLAIR , pre post contrast T1 ) non conventional sequence ( MTR , DTI , protonic spectroscopy ) . All patient follow prospectively one visit/year consist clinical neurological , neuropsychological evaluation well multimodal MRI . For healthy volunteer second PET 11C-Flumazenil also perform assess reproducibility evolution ( 50 % 1 month , 50 % 1 year ) . This study allow assess large sample follow prospectively ( 5 year ) prognosis value abnormality detect quantified PET 11C-Flumazenil grey matter atrophy progression MRI disability progression ( EDSS , MSFC , cognitive status ) . It also precise chronology appearance evolution neuronal damage MS , determine reproducibility technique . Results provide new efficient prognosis marker early MS .</detailed_description>
