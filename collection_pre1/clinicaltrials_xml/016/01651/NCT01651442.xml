	<brief_summary>Chronic insomnia prevalent disorder associate increase health care cost , impair functioning , increase risk develop serious psychiatric disorder . Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBTs ) benzodiazepine receptor agonist ( BzRA ) medication widely support approach insomnia management . Unfortunately , study compare psychological/behavioral therapy BzRAs insomnia treatment . Moreover , insomnia treatment study limit small , highly screen study sample , fixed-dose fixed-agent pharmacotherapy strategy represent usual adjustable dosing practice , relatively short follow-up interval , reliance self-report polysomnographic ( PSG ) sleep parameter outcomes , rather clinically relevant indicator remission . Finally , study yet test benefit treatment sequence respond initial insomnia therapy . This multi-site project address limitation . Two study site enroll total 224 participant meet broad criterion chronic insomnia disorder , sizeable portion ( 60 % ) sample insomnia occur comorbid psychiatric disorder . Participants evaluate clinical assessment PSG , randomly assign first-stage therapy easy-to-administer behavioral insomnia therapy ( BT ) zolpidem ( widely prescribe BzRA ) . Centrally trained therapist administer therapy accord manualized , albeit flexible , treatment algorithm . Initial outcome assess 6 week , treatment remitters follow next 12 month maintenance therapy . Those achieve remission offer re-randomization second , 6-week treatment involve pharmacotherapy ( zolpidem trazodone ) psychological therapy ( BT cognitive therapy-CT ) . All participant re-evaluated 12 week protocol initiation , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-month follow-up continue final treatment . Insomnia remission , define categorically score &lt; 8 Insomnia Severity Index , serve primary outcome treatment comparison . Secondary outcome include sleep diary PSG sleep measure ; subjective rating sleep daytime function ; adverse event ; dropout rate ; treatment acceptability . Our over-arching goal obtain new information aid development clinical guideline manage insomnia sufferer without comorbid psychiatric condition .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>complaint persistent ( i.e. , &gt; 1 month ) difficulty initiate maintain sleep despite adequate opportunity sleep ; sleep onset latency wake time sleep onset &gt; 30 minute 3 night per week two week sleep diary monitoring ; Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) score &gt; 10 indicate least `` mild '' insomnia ; score â‰¥ 2 either interference distress item screen ISI , indicate insomnia cause significant distress impairment social , occupational , area function . These criterion represent provide DSMIVTR87 , Research Diagnostic Criteria3 International Classification Sleep Disorders4 , ensure sample clinically relevant insomnia . Exclusion criterion minimal retain broadly representative sample include patient primary insomnia comorbid psychiatric disorder . Likewise , individual comorbid medical condition exclude medical condition lifethreatening would contraindicate use study medication . Exclusion criterion untreated psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , major depression ) condition specific treatment would inappropriate offer treatment ; lifetime diagnosis psychotic bipolar disorder sleep restriction medication insomnia may precipitate mania hallucination ; imminent risk suicide ; alcohol drug abuse within past year , since BzRAs crosstolerant alcohol ; terminal progressive physical illness ( e.g. , cancer , COPD ) , neurological degenerative disease ( e.g. , dementia ) ; current use medication know cause insomnia ( e.g. , steroid ) ; sleep apnea ( apnea/hypopnea index &gt; 15 ) , restless legs syndrome , periodic limb movement sleep ( PLMS arousal &gt; 15 per hour ) , circadian rhythm sleep disorder ( e.g. , advanced sleep phase syndrome ) ; habitual bedtime later 2:00 AM rise time later 10:00 AM ; consume &gt; 2 alcoholic beverage per day regular basis . Individuals use sleepaids ( prescribed overthecounter ) include willing able discontinue medication least 2 week baseline assessment . Participants use alcohol sleep aid alcohol 7:00pm regular basis require discontinue practice least two week prior baseline assessment . Individuals use psychotropic medication ( e.g. , anxiolytic , antidepressant ) automatically exclude study . Those stable dosage ( least three month ) SSRI SNRI medication show least partial remission ( via SCID ) mood anxiety disorder accept study meet selection criterion . Patients use TCAs , MAOIs , atypical antidepressant exclude even remission effect medication sleep might confound interpretation finding . We impose similar standard MDD , dysthymia , panic disorder , phobia , GAD . We realize decision enrollment may always easy make , rely available data consensus approach guide clinical decision making process</criteria>
