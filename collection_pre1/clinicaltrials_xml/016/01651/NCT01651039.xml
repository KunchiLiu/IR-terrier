	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical research study find effect drug call panobinostat ( LBH589 ) give people like multiple myeloma combination drug lenalidomide dexamethasone . The safety combination drug also study . Your physical state , change state multiple myeloma , laboratory finding take on-study help u decide panobinostat combine dexamethasone lenalidomide safe effective . This goal study therefore determine activity combination panobinostat thrice weekly every week , lenalidomide , weekly dexamethasone similar group subject . The dos lenalidomide dexamethasone approve FDA multiple myeloma take drug specific frequency 4 week ( 28 day ) period . This period call `` study cycle '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II , Single-Center , Oral Panobinostat Combination With Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug , panobinostat , make Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation . Panobinostat yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) thus consider experimental drug research study . Panobinostat available `` market '' ( available buy ) . It available clinical trial patient like medical condition . Panobinostat drug may slow growth multiple myeloma kill multiple myeloma cell block certain enzyme ( protein produce cell ) . Panobinostat show effect cancer multiple myeloma laboratory study study use animal ; however , know medicine show activity human . As 31st December 2009 , total 1116 patient already receive treatment panobinostat . Unlike panobinostat , lenalidomide ( Revlimid© ) dexamethasone approve FDA already available purchase US market . Clinical trial show lenalidomide , especially take dexamethasone , produce positive clinical response manageable side effect give subject multiple myeloma . In study , subject take panobinostat capsule , lenalidomide , dexamethasone orally . The purpose combination interfere cancerous cell multiple different way drug act differently cancer cell . By combine drug give time , might possible slow progression disease , rather study drug give separately . Researchers combine laboratory study animal drug combination combine effect show worthwhile justify clinical trial human .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must history symptomatic multiple myeloma accord International Myeloma Working Group criterion ( IMWG , 2003 ) , define follow three criterion : 1 . Clonal plasma cell &gt; 10 % bone marrow biopsy 2 . A monoclonal protein ( paraprotein ) either serum urine ( except case nonsecretory myeloma ) 3 . Evidence endorgan damage felt related plasma cell disorder ( related organ tissue impairment , ROTI , commonly refer acronym `` CRAB '' ) : Hypercalcemia serum Ca ≥ 11.5 mg/dL Renal insufficiency attributable myeloma . Serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dL Anemia : Normochromic , normocytic hemoglobin value &gt; 2g/dL low limit normal hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL Bone lesion ( lytic lesion , severe osteopenia pathologic fracture 2 . Patients must receive least one prior line therapy . For example ; One prior line therapy may consist predetermined component induction follow autologous stem cell transplantation maintenance . 3 . Patient relapse relapsed/refractory MM . 1 . Relapsed define development disease progression follow achievement stable disease ( SD ) well recent antiMM regimen . 2 . Refractory define experience less partial response ( PR ) progressive disease ( PD ) within 6 month completion recent antiMM regimen . 4 . Patients must currently measureable disease , define : 1. a. Serum M protein ≥ 1.0 g/dl ( ≥ 10 mg/l ) 2 . Urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24h 3 . Serum free light chain assay : involve FLC level ≥ 10mg/dl ( ≥ 100 mg/l ) provide serum FLC ratio abnormal 4 . If monoclonal protein detect ( nonsecretory disease ) , &gt; 30 % monoclonal bone marrow plasma cell . 5 . Patients must suitable ( accord local product information ) treatment retreatment lenalidomide &amp; dexamethasone . Note : patient previously treat lenalidomide &amp; dexamethasone eligible participate trial . 6 . Male female adult ≥ 18 year old 7 . ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 8 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week 9 .
