	<brief_title>Pramipexole Treatment Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In protocol propose assess impact treatment high dos potent D2/3 agonist pramipexole , use extended release preparation show produce continuous DA receptor stimulation . Pramipexole non-ergot DA 3 receptor-preferring agonist . In contrast pergolide , bromocriptine cabergoline , stimulate 5-HT2B receptor therefore cause cardiac valvulopathy . It therefore safely use chronically high dos , whereas pergolide withdrawn market cause cardiac valvulopathy .</detailed_description>
