	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Homeopathic Oral Antibodies Treat Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAO1 investigational medicinal product contain homoeopathic dilution ( &lt; 10-24M ) antibody purify serum rabbit immunised synthetic peptide amino acid sequence select human toll-like receptor type 3 sequence ( anti-TLR3 ) . It intend treatment viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infections ( URTIs ) common cold , influenza influenza-like illness . The validity TAO1 development approach address proof concept study efficacy non-lethal influenza infection mouse . In blinded study , TAO1 give drinking water 5 day 10 day viral challenge . The statistical analysis preclinical data carry use Mann-Whitney non-parametric test ( 2-tailed ) . The clinical disease duration significantly reduce 6.0 ( 5.25 ( 25th percentile ) ; 7.0 ( 75th percentile ) ) day 5.0 ( 5.0 ; 5.0 ) day ( p=0.00037 ) well overall disease severity lower 8.0 ( 7.0 ; 10.0 ) point 6.0 ( 5.0 ; 7.5 ) point ( p=0.00032 ) . Given high homoeopathic dilution , active substance finish product lie beyond sensitivity exist analytical assay . TAO1 therefore amenable pharmacokinetics study . There currently data clinical efficacy TAO1 common cold obtain double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial . Based efficacy animal model , expect magnitude effect TAO1 human reduction common cold duration 2-3 day , provide treatment start early onset symptom . Primary objective : To evaluate efficacy TAO1 reduce severity symptom common cold otherwise healthy adult . Secondary objective : To evaluate efficacy TAO1 reduce duration common cold . To evaluate impact TAO1 health-related Quality Life ( functional impairment ) patient common cold . To evaluate safety TAO1 . Experimental design : Double-blind , parallel-group , randomise , multicentre , placebo-controlled study . Treatment allocation : Balanced allocation TAO1 placebo ( 1:1 ) . At Visit 1 , medication , questionnaire diary card dispense patient sign informed consent . Upon contract common cold , start treatment immediately take contact doctor phone within 36 hour . On Day 2-3 onset disease , visit doctor ( Visit 2 ) confirm diagnosis . The doctor check questionnaire fill correctly . On 10-14th day ( late ) start treatment , Visit 3 plan pick questionnaire , evaluate safety , disease complication treatment compliance . Treatment group : TAO1 tablet ( dissolve mouth , swallow ; take least 10 minute apart meal and/or smoke ) : Day 1 : 3 tablet take first 2 hour treatment , 3 tablet rest Day 1 , Days 2-3 : 5 tablets/day ( intake distribute evenly daytime ) , Days 4-7 : 3 tablets/day ( intake distribute evenly daytime ) . Control : Placebo tablet : dosage regimen TAO1 . Concomitant medication : Only oral analgesics/antipyretics , paracetamol ibuprofen , allow case fever headache . Each intake medication register patient 's diary . Severity duration self-reported symptom evaluate daily validate Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey short version ( WURSS-21 ) Evaluation safety : adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) cod use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) assess accord frequency , severity , outcome relationship study drug . Data collection : Paper Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Duration treatment : 7 day Duration study : maximum 10 month . Number Investigators : 35 investigator ( General Practitioners ) . Type study : Phase II , self-contained study Number patient : 240 ( 120 treat TAO1 120 treat placebo ) Sample size justification : A sample size 115 group 80 % power detect difference mean AUCs 103 ( difference 30 % Placebo AUC mean 310 TAO1 AUC mean 207 ) assume common standard deviation 277 use two group t-test 0.050 two-sided significance level .</detailed_description>
