	<brief_summary>In area Africa malaria problem short rainy season , monthly course antimalarial drug provide effective prevention malaria child . This approach , call intermittent preventive treatment child ( IPTc ) know Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention ( SMC ) , may also useful large area Africa malaria transmit long year . It uncertain IPTc would effective , acceptable community sustainable delivered long period , important public health question key interest policy maker , area longer transmission season , burden malaria typically high highly seasonal area . Another form prevention would operationally easier African country put practice would treat malaria patient long-lasting antimalarial , protect child malaria episodes several week . Because malaria disproportionately affect certain high risk child others , cause repeat attack fever lead severe anaemia , long-acting drug may simple effective way target limited resource individual need protection . This may particularly beneficial malaria seasonal problem , repeat malaria attack bear unfortunate child , also occur close together time . The investigator propose clinical trial evaluate two form chemoprevention Kumasi , Ghana , area extend malaria transmission season . Children 5 year age currently access diagnosis treatment malaria via community base health worker . Children enrol study receive either standard community-based diagnosis treatment , treatment longer-acting artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) , standard care plus five monthly course seasonal malaria chemoprevention ( SMC ) peak transmission .</brief_summary>
