	<brief_summary>Changes maternal calcium metabolism necessary lactation provide adequate calcium breast milk development newborn skeleton . The calcium milk derive maternal skeleton , result significant bone loss , process think mediate action parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) combination decrease estrogen level . After wean , bone lose lactation rapidly regain . Differences African-American Caucasian bone metabolism well document include high bone mineral density ( BMD ) , low risk fragility fracture , low 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , high PTH African-Americans compare Caucasians . Most study bone metabolism lactate woman do Caucasians . Because difference bone metabolism African-Americans Caucasians , know whether African-Americans similar finding . The primary aim study compare change bone mineral density ( BMD ) lactation African-Americans Caucasians . It know whether loss BMD lactation race . African-Americans display skeletal resistance PTH short-term infusion low bone resorption , high BMD low fracture risk Caucasians . A recent study group indicate lactate African-American mother slightly low bone resorption quantitatively similar bone formation compare Caucasians . However , significant increase 2-3 fold marker bone formation resorption group . Therefore , currently know whether loss BMD lactation race . Primary outcome measure study include spine , hip radius BMD Dual X-Ray Absorbiometry ( DXA ) Scans lactation ( 2,12 24 week postpartum wean prior 24 week postpartum , six month wean ( +1 week ) . This longitudinal protocol distinguish two hypothesis . Either : ) measure BMD , bone loss African-Americans lactation equal Caucasians , skeletal recovery possibly accelerate compare Caucasians ; , b ) African-Americans resistant bone loss lactation compare Caucasians resistance Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein ( PTHrP ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pregnancy lactation state alter maternal calcium metabolism . Maternal calcium mobilization essential provision adequate calcium supply develop fetus infant . During pregnancy approximately 30 gram calcium require fetal skeletal development . The extra calcium derive mostly increased maternal intestinal absorption , mediate 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1 ) . During lactation , estimate 600-1000 ml milk produce daily net maternal calcium loss 200-400 mg per day ( 2,3 ) . This calcium derive maternal skeleton , result bone loss much 10 % trabecular bone serial bone density measurement ( 3 ) . Demineralization think mediate predominantly action parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) combination suppress estrogen state . Interestingly , state rapidly reverse weaning ( 4,5 ) . Several study show initial PTHrP measurement significantly high lactate woman ( 3 ) . PTHrP lactation produce high amount mammary gland . Once circulation , PTHrP increase bone resorption maternal skeleton increase calcium resorption level kidney ( 5,6,27 ) . PTHrP level find elevated much 10,000 fold milk compare maternal serum , increase suckling ( 1,6,28 ) . In mouse model , tissue specific-ablation PTHrP gene lactate mammary gland result decrease bone loss ( 6 ) . Given rapid bone loss report lactation , increase marker bone resorption decrease marker bone formation might expect . However , recently publish study group show marker bone formation bone resorption significantly elevate lactate Caucasian woman ( 7 ) . This seem unlikely tight couple bone formation resorption would result net calcium mobilization rapid bone loss lactation . A likely explanation bone resorption marker accurately reflect robust osteoclastic bone resorption , increase marker bone formation reflect increase immature , partially differentiate pre-osteoblasts arrest development therefore unable effectively form new bone . Thus , rate resorption exceed formation lactation result temporary net loss . To support idea , rat study show continuous exposure PTH PTHrP recruit initiate osteoblast differentiation , stops program prematurely preosteoblast transition ( 8,9,10 ) . This would also suggest mechanism rapid recovery see weaning : withdrawing PTHrP stimulus , osteoclast-mediated bone resorption would abruptly cease , previously recruit osteoblast precursor would rapidly complete differentiation program restore bone lose lactation . African-American bone metabolism differs Caucasian bone metabolism several way . African-Americans display high bone density low risk develop osteoporosis osteoporotic fracture compare Caucasians ( 15-17,29-31 ) . There may factor may explain racial difference bone metabolism , include altered calcium economy , vitamin D difference , peak attain bone mass , muscle mass obesity , remodel rate , bone micro-architecture , hip axis geometry , unknown hereditary difference . In particular , well establish 25-Hydroxyvitamin D ( 25-OH D ) level much low African-Americans , due darker pigmentation result reduce dermal production 25-OH D well reduce intake vitamin D ( 11 ) . This hypovitaminosis result relative secondary hyperparathyroidism , corroborate high level PTH 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D well decrease urinary calcium excretion ( 12-14 ) . Paradoxically , high PTH level correlate increase bone loss . In fact , bone turnover actually reduce compare Caucasians , suggest African-American bone resistant effect PTH , whereas renal sensitivity maintain increase ( 14,18 ) . The vast majority study examine bone metabolism lactate woman Caucasian woman . Studies bone turnover calcitropic hormone lactate African-Americans scarce . Over ten year ago , study examine marker bone metabolism population lactate Gambian woman ( Gambia ) compare similar cohort British lactating woman ( UK ) . The study demonstrate significant increase older marker bone formation resorption lactation , also show high level PTH , 1,25 Vitamin D , serum phosphate , osteocalcin , alkaline phosphatase Gambian lactate population compare British lactate population ( 19 ) . However , Gambian woman differ significantly black woman develop world term nutrition , overall calorie calcium intake . Also contrast African-Americans , black Gambian woman display low BMD Caucasians . Interestingly , study , Gambian woman demonstrate significant loss whole body hip BMD lactation show little evidence bone mass regain wean . In fact , Gambian woman continue BMD loss hip , contrast Caucasian control . A recent study group ( unpublished ) explore bone turnover marker calcium metabolism African-American lactation . Markers bone resorption lower African-American Caucasians non-lactating young woman , increase 2-3 fold group lactation . Baseline bone formation comparable African-Americans Caucasians , also increase 2-3 fold group . Fractional excretion calcium lower African-Americans baseline remain constant group lactation . It remain unclear whether bone loss occur similar rate lactation African-American population . Up point , study African-Americans utilized bone densitometry quantitate bone loss recovery lactation . This study aim demonstrate change bone density African-American woman high bone turnover state lactation . It also permit measurement calcium metabolism , marker bone formation resorption , calcitropic hormone compare bone density change . We also look racial difference lactate bone metabolism directly compare cohort African-American lactate woman similar Caucasian cohort . No prior study do compare bone mineral density change lactate American black Caucasian woman .</detailed_description>
