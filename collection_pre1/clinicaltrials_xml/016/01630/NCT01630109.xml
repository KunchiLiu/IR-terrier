	<detailed_description>Pill Capsule Endoscopy allow Gastroenterologists visualize mucosa small bowel beyond reach endoscope extent never possible . It involve ingestion small pill camera approximately size large vitamin . 8 hour image transmit sensor worn around patient 's waist . At conclusion test , image download computer physician review . Meanwhile , PillCam™ pass naturally digestive system require retrieval . Many pill capsule study incomplete due failure pill capsule reach colon . Metoclopramide ( brand name Reglan ) anti-emetic also know pro-motility effect GI tract . The thought behind study metoclopramide increase rate passage pill capsule GI tract allow high completion rate pill capsule study . Patients schedule pill capsule endoscopy approach morning procedure inform research study . After proper consent obtain patient receive either 5 mg Metoclopramide , 10 mg Metoclopramide , placebo pill 30 minute prior pill capsule study . The pill capsule camera record 8 hour worth data . The patient return conclusion study turn recorder . The order gastroenterologist read study . Information regard pill capsule completion ( pill capsule go ileocecal valve ) , gastric transit time , small bowel transit time record analyze .</detailed_description>
