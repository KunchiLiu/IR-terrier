Recent data American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Management Closed Claims Project [ 1 ] show percentage claim result adverse respiratory event , though decline ( 42 % 1980s 32 % 1990s ) , continue constitute large source morbidity mortality anesthetize patient . In 2005 , close claim analysis trend anesthesia-related death brain damage 1975 2000 show respiratory event ( n=503 ) responsible death brain damage , difficult endotracheal intubation ( n=115 ) , inadequate oxygenation ( n=111 ) inadvertent esophageal intubation ( n=66 ) top three cause [ 2 ] .</detailed_description>
