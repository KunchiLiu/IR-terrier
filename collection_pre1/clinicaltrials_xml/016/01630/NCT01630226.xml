	<brief_summary>This single center , non-randomized , open label phase II trial evaluate clinical pathologic response neoadjuvant cisplatin-monotherapy BRCA1 positive patient . The study enroll patient diagnose breast cancer BRCA1 mutation . Patients eligible primary breast cancer ( measure mammogram ultrasound MRI ) confirm histological diagnosis invasive breast cancer core biopsy . If axilla lymph node suspect fine needle aspiration biopsy perform . Patients draw one three oncology center : Szczecin , Bielsko-Biała Kraków . Patients obtain staging investigation monitor . Once entry criterion meet consent obtain , patient obtain baseline stag investigation within 3 week trial registration .

After four cycle chemotherapy patient undergo definitive surgery ( mastectomy breast-conserving surgery ) . Sentinel lymph node procedure perform . In case positive lymph node standard lymph node surgery perform . Pathological complete response define evidence residual tumor breast axilla . There may evidence ductal carcinoma situ .
