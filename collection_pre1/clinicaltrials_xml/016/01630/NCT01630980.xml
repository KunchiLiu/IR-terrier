	<detailed_description>Background : Tree nut ( almond , Brazil nut , cashew , hazelnut , macadamia nut , pecan , pine nut , pistachio walnuts ) important source unsaturated fatty acid , vegetable protein , fibre , well mineral , vitamin , phytonutrients . Although dietary guideline Americans American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend consumption nut cardiovascular risk reduction US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) issue qualified coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk reduction claim nut , none diabetes association address nuts recent recommendation . This omission despite CHD major cause death diabetes . Several trial undertaken diabetes , , include large date group , demonstrate advantage glycemic control . Although remain trial fail show significant improvement glycemic control , direction effect favor nut , along improvement complementary marker metabolic control . Need review : The lack high quality data area support diabetes recommendation represent urgent call strong evidence . A systematic review meta-analysis control feeding trial remain `` Gold Standard '' evidence nutrition guideline development . Objective : To provide evidence-based guidance diabetes guideline , conduct two systematic review meta-analyses control feed trial assess effect tree nut ( almond , Brazil nut , cashew , hazelnut , macadamia nut , pecan , pine nut , pistachio walnut ) cardiometabolic control : ( 1 ) `` Tree nut glycemic control '' ( 2 ) `` Tree nut feature metabolic syndrome '' . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Intervention trial investigate effect exchange nut diet cardiometabolic risk outcome human include . Studies &lt; 3-weeks diet duration , lack control , report non-isocaloric comparison exclude . Data extraction : Independent investigator ( ≥2 ) extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , nut form , dose , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean±SEM value extract endpoint . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Risk bias study quality assess use risk bias tool Heyland Methodological Quality Score ( MQS ) , respectively . Outcomes : The two propose analysis assess set outcomes related different area cardiometabolic control : ( 1 ) glycemic control ( glycated blood protein [ HbA1c , fructosamine , glycated albumin ] , fast glucose , fast insulin , homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance [ HOMA-IR ] ) ( 2 ) harmonize metabolic syndrome feature ( waist circumference , TG , HDL-C , blood pressure , fast glucose ) . Data synthesis : Pooled analysis conduct use Generic Inverse Variance method random effect model . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Exceptions make use fixed-effects model &lt; 5 included trial irrespective heterogeneity small trial pool large precise trial absence statistically significant heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochrane 's Q quantify I2 . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analysis include nut type , nut dose , duration follow-up , change saturate fat intake , change dietary fibre intake , design ( crossover , parallel ) , study quality , baseline endpoint value . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analysis ( e.g . age , sex , level feed control [ metabolic , supplement , dietary advice ] , washout crossover trial , energy balance background diet , composition background diet [ total % energy fat , carbohydrate , protein ] , change cholesterol intake , change glycemic index , etc. ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . Publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot application Egger 's Begg 's test . Knowledge translation plan : Results two systematic review meta-analyses disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Two applicant ( JLS , CWCK ) also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) nutrition therapy one applicant ( JLS ) 2015 European Association Study Diabetes ( EASD ) CPG nutrition therapy ( JLS , CWCK ) . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Significance : The two propose systematic review meta-analyses aid knowledge translation related effect tree nut diabetes metabolic syndrome , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim .</detailed_description>
