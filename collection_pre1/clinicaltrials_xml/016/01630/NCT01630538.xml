	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Therapy Refractory Antibody-Mediated Rejection ( AMR ) Kidney Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There consensus optimal treatment de novo donor specific antibody-mediated rejection . Optimizing baseline immunosuppression ( calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) , anti-proliferative agent , anti-inflammatory ) consider foundational insufficient . Pulse steroids routinely use . A number immunosuppressive approach try uncontrolled trial . The strong evidence , least early antibody-mediated rejection ( &lt; 6 month transplant ) , exist plasmapheresis , without low dose IVIg , high dose IVIg alone . However , note recent FDA workshop , `` literature suggest [ agent ] evidence efficacy management acute antibody-mediated rejection , could consider standard care , treatment regime standardize optimize . '' Moreover evidence support efficacy approach late , oppose early antibody-mediated rejection distinctly lack .</detailed_description>
