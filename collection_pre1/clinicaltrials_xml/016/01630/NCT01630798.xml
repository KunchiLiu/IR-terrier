	<brief_summary>You invite participate research study develop new way look abnormal areas/tissues esophagus . The current endoscope use look esophagus good , area n't look different naked eye , endoscope ca n't improve . The investigator look use special fluorescent stain addition special endoscope design see abnormal area obvious naked eye . Currently specialize microscope fluorescent stain use clinical laboratory take several day process get result . It may helpful look area sample abnormal tissue endoscopy procedure . You ask let u use `` fluorescent peptide '' special endoscope allow u `` see '' esophagus fluorescent white light upper GI endoscopy procedure help target biopsy . Peptides small chain amino acid ( build block make protein ) link together . Our peptide chain 7 amino acid attach fluorescent dye call FITC ( like one use eye doctor ) . The investigator prepare special `` fluorescent peptide '' , `` glow '' special light use help u separate normal tissue abnormal tissue . In study , investigator apply special fluorescent peptide spray catheter esophagus help u target biopsy . Both routine target biopsy take endoscopist feel indicate . This phase 1b study . This mean although investigator apply peptide 25 people first research study , investigator still need learn `` fluorescent peptide '' people . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve agent , allow u test study . The main goal study see peptide `` glow '' well investigator take picture area glow . This research study peptide ability see `` light fluoresce '' . Being study apply peptide wo n't change biopsy take endoscopy do .</brief_summary>
