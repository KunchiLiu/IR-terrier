	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm , unresectable , advanced metastatic ( Stage IV per AJCC 7th edition TNM staging ) NSCLC 2 . Males females ≥ 18 year age screening . 3 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week screening , accord investigator 's assessment . 4 . Patients must receive one prior line platinumbased systemic anticancer therapy advance metastatic NSCLC . Prior maintenance therapy allow consider line therapy continue end treatment regimen . 5 . Patients must document radiological disease progression either firstline therapy . 6 . Patients must least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criterion . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 1 screening . 8 . Have adequate value , bone marrow , renal liver function screen define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary benign condition Gilbert 's disease ) AST ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN 9 .
