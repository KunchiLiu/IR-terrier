	<detailed_description>New evidence suggest practice immediate clamp cut umbilical cord birth may contribute anemia infancy . Immediate clamp deprive full term infant 60 100 ml whole blood represent 30 50 mg/kg iron . The `` low tech-low cost '' intervention delay cord clamp reduce anemia infancy enhance placental-infant transfusion birth . The risk maternal bleeding make delay cord clamp time cesarean section challenge . In United States ( US ) , immediate clamp cut umbilical cord usual practice time cesarean section . Milking umbilical cord may offer alternative delay cord clamp prevention anemia infancy time speed critical factor time cesarean section . Although obstetrical pediatric provider fear adverse outcome delay cord clamp umbilical cord milk polycythemia jaundice , recent clinical trial fail support fear . In spite iron supplementation iron fortify formula food , iron deficiency infant toddler remain significant public health problem US . Poor iron store first year life lead iron deficiency potential cause harm develop brain . The number births cesarean section rise country . According late US birth data report National Center Health Statistics , cesarean section rate 32 % , 50 % increase since 1996 . Immediate cord clamp routine practice time cesarean section US . Consequently 1.4 million baby annually umbilical cord cut immediately time birth . This routine practice interferes placental transfusion result less blood volume red blood cell increase anemia birth lower total body iron store newborn six month . The potential effect immediate cord clamp cesarean section enormous public health infant country . However association cord clamp time infant well-being generally recognize clinician . Delaying clamp cut cord two minute know offer benefit improve iron store term newborn extend least first six month life . Although benefit baby , two minute delay feasible mother time cesarean section . However , milk umbilical cord time cesarean section may viable alternative delay cord clamping may prevent anemia infant iron deficiency . Most available literature umbilical cord milk write 50 year ago . Even , study support technique safe term infant result high neonatal hemoglobin hematocrit level . One recent study find cord milk beneficial cause harm low birth weight preterm infant . This study help establish feasibility use umbilical cord milk alternative delay cord clamp time cesarean section . Umbilical cord milking examine selective intervention accelerate placental transfusion delay clamp ideal . It potential prevent anemia iron deficiency infancy full-term infant bear cesarean section .</detailed_description>
