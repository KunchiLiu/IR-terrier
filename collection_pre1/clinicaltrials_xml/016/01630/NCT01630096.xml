	<detailed_description>Project Summary : Clostridium Difficile ( c. diff ) bacteria cause much morbidity mortality worldwide . It cause diarrhea abdominal pain . It mild self-limited , severe lethal , even developed country . It require removal colon try spare victim 's life . This n't always successful . Current treatment withdrawal unnecessary antibiotic , addition one two antibiotic work pretty reliably c.diff , hydration , observation sign patient might need operate . The investigator propose instead try kill bacteria problem , limit antibiotic choice , investigator give patient bowel prep quickly reliably wash bacteria , toxin actually wreak havoc , system . The investigator collect variable mortality , LOS , ICU day , surgical intervention ( colectomy ileostomy lavage ) , time test negative treatment start , APACHE score . The investigator track regular diet resume . The investigator track immunocompromised state see effect . The investigator use visual analog scale ass time feel well well . Project description : Rationale- Clostridium difficile ( c. diff ) bacteria gut ability make u sick release toxin cause colitis . It traditionally affect hospitalize recently antibiotic . Recently investigator see community acquire case well case antibiotic precede infection . C. diff produce self-limited diarrhea bloating , become severe include severe diarrhea , bowel necrosis , toxemia death . Over last four year Genesys , death rate c. diff ( cause mortality rate ) average 9.6 % infect . The investigator average 230 case per year c. diff infection . Clearly big problem . Traditional treatment IV fluid , one two antibiotic ( vancomycin flagyl ) along bowel rest , withdraw unnecessary broad spectrum antibiotic ( Cohen , 2010 . ) This help people , still progress case . If disease becomes severe enough , near total colon resection require ( surgery ) , point disease process , 35-80 % die anyway ( Neal , 2011 . ) Those survive lot morbidity ileostomy ( hassle stool bag , dehydration frequently accompany ileostomy ) . It 's extremely challenging problem fear worsen becomes resistant antibiotic currently effective . The investigator need find good way treat . Recently Pittsburgh , study perform take sick patient operate room earlier diverted stool stream ileostomy flush Go-Lytely ( polyethylene glycol ) colon clean stool , bacteria , toxin ( remove colon ) , follow antibiotic colon . They show reduction mortality rate surgery 50 % 19 % reduction 62 % ( Neal , 2011 ) . The result promising , process require two operation - one make ileostomy another reverse ileostomy later . It also wait patient get sick clean GI tract bacteria toxin . A second paper report two case chronic c. diff patient take bowel prep Go-Lytely mouth , 'cured ' 36-48 month count ( Liacouras , 1996 ) . In investigator study , investigator still withdraw unnecessary antibiotic , provide hydration , treat antibiotic regimen admit physician decide . But investigator also add bowel prep polyethylene glycol 3350 solution ( PEG solution ) , flush stool bacteria . The investigator suspicion give c. diff patient bowel prep PEG solution orally ( nasogastric tube unable swallow ) , investigator wash c. diff bacteria toxin already produce , instead try kill bacteria still colon . The investigator think investigator effectively treat even sick c. diff patient without operation . In fact , investigator quite possibly prevent many mild case progress severe case first place , thereby greatly decrease morbidity mortality scary disease . Objective- The investigator primary objective show oral administration polyethylene glycol bowel prep solution decrease mortality clostridium difficile infect patient . Secondary objective include show decreased length hospital stay , decrease ICU day , decreased time test negative c. diff toxin stool , decrease surgical intervention , good patient perception . The investigator use visual analog scale track quickly patient perceive good . The investigator also determine time diet resumption immunocompromised status change outcomes study . Methodology- The study prospective , randomize , control trial . Eligible patient assign computer generate , randomized list either standard treatment ( IV fluid vancomycin flagyl ) intervention treatment ( IV fluid , vancomycin flagyl , oral bowel prep ) . Study subject criterion include : adult great age 18 , test positive c. diff GRMC inpatient . Testing via either DNA amplification assay , flexible endoscopic diagnosis . The lab endoscopist contact Dr. Vance Dr. Alvarez , approach patient consent , enroll , randomize . There sex ethnic background exclusion criterion , health status patient alter patient selection . The investigator plan enroll total 400 subject . Exclusion criterion include : 1 . Pregnancy 2 . Less 18 yr age 3 . Mentally handicap 4 . Those sick enough require surgery diagnosis shall enrol , operate point . 5 . Patients severe ileus suspect small bowel obstruction present . Interventions- Nu-Lytely Go-Lytely ( polyethylene glycol 3350 ) , produce Braintree Laboratories , Incorporated , administer study patient . These two product interchangeable investigator institution work mechanism action mechanical bowel prep . They dose one 8oz glass , orally , every 10 minute 6 liter ingest . If clear bowel movement point , 2 liter give . If difficulty drink solution , investigator offer place nasogastric tube deliver PEG solution GI tract . It FDA approve bowel cleansing , though specifically clear c.diff . It long history effective bowel prepping good patient safety . Because PEG solution dehydrate degree , investigator plan give 500 mL IV bolus saline start bowel prep prevent issue . These patient generally dehydrated disease process anyway , IV fluid generally good idea . The investigator monitor patient ' BUN creatinine , blood pressure , heart rate , urine output treat additionally dehydration need . If patient 's electrolyte significantly abnormal enrollment , investigator may order additional chemistry panel even ensure worsen . The investigator expect would already order primary physician case , even without PEG solution , routine patient care . To accomplish investigator secondary objective time test negative c. diff , investigator also collect stool test c. diff daily , start day enrollment negative . This Immuno card c. diff toxins A &amp; B test ( available Meridian Bioscience ) , DNA amplification method yield false positive result bowel prep . Observations- The observation make chart review discharge include mortality , length stay , operative intervention , present APACHE score . Time test negative treatment start assess daily , base stool test result . Diet admit physician ' discretion base patient status , investigator monitor see seem affect success treat c. diff . Additionally , investigator use visual analog scale determine patient feel well . Nurses require standing policy record visual analog pain scale response ( scale attach ) . The investigator use response study . Sample size- To show mortality reduction 70 % significant population 10 % mortality , power analysis determine 200 group require achieve 82 % power detection . A total 400 subject enrol study . Data Management Analysis- The primary hypothesis compare mortality group conduct use Chi square analysis . The secondary hypothesis compare mean day negative test c. diff toxin , analyze use Independent Students ' t-Test mean ( Mann Whitney-U test compare median number day ) . Hospital ICU LOS compare use Students ' t-Test patient perceive improvement compare use Mann Whitney-U test . Surgical intervention rate compare group Chi-square analysis . Ethical Considerations : The study ethical base possibility effective way treat difficult disease , possibility decrease patient ' mortality rate surgical intervention . The possible nausea , dehydration , abdominal bloating discomfort treat symptomatically , reward potentially much outweigh risk . Persons mental disability exclude . If study success , may dramatically reduce mortality Genesys elsewhere . The Centers Disease Control estimate 14,000 patient die USA annually c.diff infection induce diarrhea . The investigator could n't locate worldwide number , clearly significant , reduction death effective , widely available , inexpensive treatment welcome everywhere . Informed decision-making : Study eligible patient approach study physician . The study explain patient family present . The consent form provide patient give time ask question read consent form . The investigator inform consent form attach . Patients agree enrol study study physician . Gender Issues : The investigator plan include woman men alike study . When investigator analyze data , investigator determine significant difference outcome base gender , report .</detailed_description>
