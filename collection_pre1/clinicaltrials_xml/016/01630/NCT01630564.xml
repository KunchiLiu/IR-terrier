	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn high tolerate dose T cell safely give patient whose cancer return umbilical cord blood transplant ( UCBT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Cord Blood Lymphocyte Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You UCBT . A small amount previously infuse cord blood frozen . This save cord blood treat MD Anderson Stem Cell Laboratory interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) clinical bead produce help generate need T cell . This take 2 week . When product ready , give expand cord blood T cell infusion central venous catheter ( CVC ) . Cord Blood T Cell Infusion : You assign dose level cord blood T cell base join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue 3 dose level , high tolerable dose cord blood find . You receive cord blood T cell CVC . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Tests : Before cord blood T cell infusion : - Your medical history record , physical exam . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test , test cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , see well transplant take . After cord blood T cell infusion : - Your vital sign measure ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You pulse oximetry test check amount oxygen blood . For test clothespin-shaped clip place finger 1 minute . One day cord blood T cell infusion : - You physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may . - You check possible reaction infusion , include graft versus host disease ( GVHD - condition transplant tissue attack body transplant ) . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test test CMV . One time week first 3 week cord blood T cell infusion : - Your medical history record , physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may . - You check possible reaction infusion , include GVHD . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test test CMV . At 1 month ( +/- 7 day ) cord blood T cell infusion : - Your medical history record , physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may . - You check possible reaction infusion , include GVHD . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test , test CMV , learn well transplant take . - You may bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone bone marrow withdrawn large needle . - You may image scan check status disease and/or check possible infection . End-of-Study Visit : At 45 day ( +/- 7 day ) cord blood T cell infusion take study : - Your medical history record , physical exam . - You ask feel side effect may . - You check possible reaction infusion , include GVHD . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test , test CMV , learn well transplant take . Length Study : You study 100 day cord blood T cell infusion . You may take study early disease get bad , enough cord blood infuse , infuse due infection/contamination , intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . You talk study doctor want leave study early . If take study early , still may need return routine post-transplant follow-up visit , transplant doctor decides need . This investigational study . The cord blood T cell expansion procedure FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 18 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
