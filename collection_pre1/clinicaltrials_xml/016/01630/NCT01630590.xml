	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn add cabozantinib ( also know XL184 ) hormonal therapy help control prostate cancer . The safety drug also study . Cabozantinib design block certain protein blood cause cancer cell grow . This may cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Androgen Ablation Patients With Androgen-Dependent Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take 1 capsule cabozantinib mouth 1 time every day study . You eat drink anything water 2 hour 1 hour take study drug . You take capsule least 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You also give separate direction take study drug . You also receive hormone therapy . The hormone drug receive standard care hormone therapy . The study doctor decide hormone therapy receive explain take hormone therapy , well risk . You give drug diary record take cabozantinib . You return diary study staff come clinic . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect may drug may take . If receive Coumadin , every week first 3 week , blood drawn ( 1 teaspoon ) test blood clot function . Every 3 week first 12 week study , every 6 week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 3 week first 12 week study , every 12 week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check thyroid pancreatic function . The frequency testing may change study doctor think need . Every 6 week , follow test perform : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw measure PSA level biomarker test . - Urine collect routine test . - You may test perform near home study doctor think tolerate treatment . Every 12 week , bone scan CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug long study doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest stop . Long-Term Follow-Up : You contact every 6 month stop take study drug check feeling status disease . This consist phone call , e-mail , medical record review . If call , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Cabozantinib FDA approve treat patient certain type thyroid cancer . Its use study investigational . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Prior therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) inhibitor type investigational agent allow adjunct definitive local therapy , give &lt; /=6 month , complete least 12 month initiate therapy metastatic disease . 10 . Patients `` anaplastic '' feature eligible trial define least one following : ) Any follow metastatic presentation : exclusive visceral metastasis , radiographically predominant lytic bone metastasis identify plain Xray CT scan , bulky ( &gt; 5 cm long dimension ) lymphadenopathy highgrade ( gleason &gt; 8 ) tumor mass prostate/pelvis . ; b ) Low PSA ( &lt; /= 10 ng/ml ) initial presentation ( prior androgen ablation symptomatic progression castratesetting ) plus high volume ( &gt; /=20 ) bone metastasis . ; c ) Elevated serum LDH ( &gt; /= 2 x ULN ) elevate serum CEA ( &gt; /= 2 x ULN ) absence etiology . ; ) Short interval ( &lt; /= 180 day ) castrateresistant progression follow initiation hormonal therapy . 11 . Sexually active fertile subject , partner , must agree use medically accept method contraception ( eg , barrier method , include male condom , female condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) . 1 . Biological agent ( antibody , immune modulators , cytokine , vaccine ) radionuclide treatment within 6 week first dose study treatment . 2 . Radiation therapy within 2 week prior initiation study treatment . 3 . Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis epidural disease require current treatment include steroid anticonvulsant . 4 . The subject another diagnosis malignancy require systemic treatment within last two year , unless nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer . 5 . The subject uncontrolled significant intercurrent illness include , limited , following condition : Chronically uncontrolled hypertension , define conventionally consistent repeat systolic pressure 140 mmHg diastolic pressure 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy . This may better establish home BP read clinic visit result . There criterion relate specific BP result require eligibility , acute BP elevation related iatrogenic cause , acute pain , transient reversible cause consider exclusion criterion . The intent exclude patient chronically uncontrolled hypertension might exacerbate Cabozantinib . 6 . Continued # 5 ) Other cardiovascular disorder symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , unstable angina pectoris , clinicallysignificant cardiac arrhythmia , history stroke ( include transient ischemic attack [ TIA ] , ischemic event ) within 6 month study treatment , myocardial infarction within 6 month study treatment , history thromboembolic event require therapeutic anticoagulation within 6 month study treatment main portal vein vena cava thrombosis occlusion . ; Gastrointestinal ( GI ) disorder particularly associate high risk perforation fistula formation include : Any following time screen ; ) intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade GI mucosa b ) active peptic ulcer disease , c ) inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis 7 . Continued # 6 ) Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : ) history abdominal fistula b ) gastrointestinal perforation c ) bowel obstruction gastric outlet obstruction ; ) intraabdominal abscess . Note : Complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even abscess occur 6 month ago . GI surgery ( particularly associate delayed incomplete healing ) within 28 day . Note : Complete heal follow abdominal surgery must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even surgery occur 28 day ago . Other disorder associate high risk fistula formation include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy concurrent evidence intraluminal tumor involve trachea esophagus . 8 .
