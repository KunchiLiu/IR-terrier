	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) one lead cause mortality morbidity . PCI , well-proved booming measure CHD management , invasive high cost , however knowledge real-life PCI use China limit . Within nation-wide regional representative probability sample hospital China , 14,000 CAG/PCI inpatient case sample randomly 2001 2011 . The sampled medical record review abstracted national coordinating centre , order evaluate treatment pattern , outcome , cost PCI , past decade . Basic data innovative evidence accelerate evidence-based clinical practice policy making , improve patient outcomes future finally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) major concern public health globally , well China , remarkable variation resource available health system performance note . Relatively limited information available evidence-based therapy incorporate appropriately routine clinical practice . In addition , little information available magnitude quality PCI , develop rapidly past several decade . Practical apply knowledge large unselected population need guide practice policy quality improvement cost reduction . To investigate treatment pattern outcome PCI past decade China , use stratify two-stage cluster sample design , 70 sample hospital , 7,000 CAG/PCI case select 2011 , 3,500 2001 2006 separately . Photocopies 14,000 medical record CAG/PCI case send national coordinating centre . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract well trained professional abstractor . By characterize difference patient ' feature , compare use medication procedure , examine in-hospital outcome , 'll define gap clinical practice guideline , well disparities across different region hospital , evaluate treatment pattern outcome last decade China . New knowledge generate PCI management China , provide evidence policy-making clinical guideline , improve patient prognosis future finally .</detailed_description>
