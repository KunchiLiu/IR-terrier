	<brief_title>Safety Study Using Regulatory T Cells Induce Liver Transplantation Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first trial involve generation CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs peripheral blood pre-transplant patient , follow course ( 24 month ) tacrolimus ( 5-10 ng/ml ) treatment ( prevent chronic rejection ) administration CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs ( 1 x 106 cells/kg ) several interval ( tolerance induction ) . The immunesuppress drug gradully withdraw within one year . The number CD4+CD25+ Tregs need base assumption frequency alloreactive CD4+ T cell direct indirect allospecificity 1/104 1/105 , respectively . The second trial carry 1-10 year post living donor liver transplantation patient currently immunosuppressive drug treatment . The investigator isolate CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs patient , expand mismatch living donor antigen . The patient subsequently treat expand donor-antigen specific CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs ( 1 x 106 cells/kg ) several interval , immunosuppressive drug treatment withdrawn . In clinical trial , investigator monitor number allospecific Tregs patient different time period , test suppressive function vitro . If sign graft rejection , patient switch back immunosuppressive drug treatment . The investigator expect innovative Tregs immunosuppressive regimen lead achieve permanent liver transplantation tolerance without use conventional immunosuppressive drug : holygrail clinical transplantation medicine .</detailed_description>
