	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) major concern public health globally , well China , AMI one lead cause mortality morbidity . Remarkable variation resource available health system performance note , however little information available evidence-based therapy incorporate appropriately routine clinical practice China . In addition , basic data evidence safety , efficacy , effectiveness treatment AMI long-term recovery limit . Practical apply knowledge large unselected population need guide practice policy quality improvement cost reduction . This study enroll patient confirm diagnosis AMI consecutively 20 tertiary hospital 20 secondary hospital scatter China . At study entry , participant interview index hospitalization , collect information symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract medical record well trained professional abstractor . At 1 month , 6 month , 12 month discharge , participant return clinic follow visit , face-to-face interview conduct get information clinical event , symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care recovery period . At 1-Month 12-Month follow-up visit , blood urine sample collect . Participants ' blood sample store future biologic genetic study . This study examine various real-life factor may affect patient recovery heart attack , include patient ' characteristic treatment measure .
