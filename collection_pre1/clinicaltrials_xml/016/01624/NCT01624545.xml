	<brief_title>To Scan Not Scan : The Role Follow-up CT Scanning Management Chronic Subdural Hematoma After Neurosurgical Evacuation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic subdural hematoma ( CSH ) one common intracranial bleeding patient 60 year age frequently find neurosurgical entity . Age relate brain atrophy lead enlargement subarachnoid space , space limit dura mater arachnoid membrane . Blood vessel occupy space stretch may rupture minor head trauma . Although result bleed often without noticeable consequence patient , anatomical outcome may serious enlarges subdural space . The formation new leaky capillary-like vessel and/or volume enhance osmotic gradient lead enlargement subdural hematoma week , fill intracranial space compress brain . Headaches , gait disturbance , language problem , hemiparesis decrease consciousness among many present symptom tend develop day week . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head typically reveal blood accumulation subdural space . Standard treatment include evacuation subdural blood burr hole ( see ) either local general anesthesia . In case hematoma clot evacuate burr hole small craniotomy perform . CSH fear high recurrence rate ( 9 27 % ) mostly occur within 3 month initial operation . The optimal follow-up course operate patient remain controversial . Due high rate recurrence , one strategy perform serial CT scan order identify recurrent hematoma early . The radiologic evidence recurrent significant persistent hematoma often lead reoperation . Another strategy surgical hematoma evacuation closely follow patient neurological examination perform neuroimaging case persistent new neurologic deficit . Advocators strategy argue follow routine CT scan may harmful due additional maybe unnecessary surgery hospital day patient population mark advanced age fragility . However , even neuroimaging do routinely , correlation observe radiologic evidence hematoma remnant reoperation rate . This observation report Mori Maeda retrospective analysis 500 patient . Some persistent hematoma almost always see surgical intervention seem correlation re-expansion rate brain likelihood hematoma recurrence . However , correlation weak little practical value patient treatment . The high incidence hematoma remnant post-op image complicates indication re-operation recurrent CSH solely image criterion . Since presence amount remnant hematoma operation poor predictor future recurrent hematoma clinician refrain postoperative CT scan rely solely neurological assessment . If patient become symptomatic , serial CT scan perform surgery schedule case persistent , enlarge new hematoma . The discrepancy follow-up strategy reflect current incomplete understanding pathophysiology CSH recurrence . The aim current study evaluate role CT scan postoperative treatment course neurosurgical evacuation CSH prospective , randomize control trial . Objective The hypothesis interest test trial follow-up protocol without CT scan inferior follow-up protocol serial CT scan neurosurgical evacuation CSH assess modify Rankin scale 6 month . Additional hypothesis interest size/volume/features hematoma rest/remnant early ( &lt; 72 hour ) CT scan neurosurgical evacuation correlate neurological status patient size/volume/features hematoma rest/remnant post-op CT scan predictive reoperation . Methods Patients screen include study within 48 hour surgery chronic subdural hematoma ( burr hole trepanation insertion drainage ) . Study patient randomize ( 1:1 ) day 2 surgery CT-Scan arm ( group A ) Clinical arm ( group B ) . A CT scan schedule patient group A day 2 30 surgery . Patients study group ( A B ) receive neurological follow-up examination day 2 , 30 day 6 month surgery . Regardless randomization patient receive CT scan judge necessary clinical ground time .</detailed_description>
