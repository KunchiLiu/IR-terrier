	<brief_title>Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment Social Deficits Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) implicate wide range social behavior include attachment bond , emotion recognition , eye gaze social cue , memory social information . Social impairment represent one intractable feature autism , evidence suggest OT biology dysregulated individual disorder . The central aim research outline test whether OT administration child autism increase quality quantity social interaction enhances ability process emotional social information . Findings initial single-dose OT administration study teenaged adult male autism show improvement aspect social functioning , replication extension well-controlled treatment trial young male female subject necessary evaluate effectiveness . We therefore aim investigate effect intranasal OT social cognition behavior immediately follow single-dose ( 24IU ) follow 4-week period OT ( 24IU BID ) administration sample 50 subject autism age 6 12 year . The primary outcome study change social behavior , determine parent rating Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) 4-week treatment period . Secondary outcome change function laboratory-based measure social behavior cognition follow single-dose 4-week OT administration . Research small study sample ( N=13 ) also identify treatment responder non-responders single-dose OT . Thus , also aim identify biological cognitive behavioral variable ( i.e. , pretreatment level social function pretreatment plasma hormone level ) may influence treatment response efficacy large study sample . On completion 4-week treatment period subject option participate another 4-week double-blind trial switch alternate nasal spray previously receive . They undergo fourth final assessment time-point use test procedure outline completion 4-week dosing . By provide subject option participate second 4-week treatment trial , subject opportunity receive active oxytocin nasal spray . We also able examine ongoing effect oxytocin treatment group receive placebo second 4-week administration period . Subjects willing take part second trial exit study refer treat physician .</detailed_description>
