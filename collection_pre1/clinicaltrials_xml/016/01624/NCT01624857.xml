	<detailed_description>Depression frequently observe patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) represent significant risk factor major cardiovascular event . Depression patient exist CHD confers relative risk 1.5 2.5 cardiac morbidity mortality . In previous cross-sectional prospective study , prevalence major depression patient CHD range 10 % 47 % , slightly high rate report ( 28 % ) patient require coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . In CABG patient , symptom depression may increase mortality bypass surgery associate atherosclerotic progression . In 2008 , American Heart Association recommend routine screening depression patient CHD various setting , include hospital , physician 's office , clinic , cardiac rehabilitation center . In recent year , grow evidence also suggest existence bidirectional relationship depress mood inflammation . Dantzer associate report inflammation lead development symptom depression vulnerable individual . Consistent finding , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , currently one available clinical biomarker inflammation , report associate increased long-term mortality extend hospital length stay patient undergoing nonemergency CABG-only surgery . And previous study show elevated serum hsCRP independent predictor depression CABG patient preoperatively also 6 month surgery . This study enroll patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery Fuwai Hospital . At study entry , participant interview index hospitalization , collect information depressive symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract medical record well trained professional abstractor . At 1 month 6 month discharge , participant return clinic follow visit , face-to-face interview conduct get information clinical event , depressive symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care recovery period . Practical guideline establish base finding improve patient ' outcome future finally .</detailed_description>
