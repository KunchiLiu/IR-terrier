	<brief_summary>Humans attain binocular vision two retinal image eye series sensory motor process culminate perception stereoscopic depth . Looking scene create two slightly different image retinas due eye ' different position head . This call binocular disparity provide information calculate depth therefore enable stereopsis . Physiologically two retinal image superimpose merge one stereoscopic image . If one image present one eye experimental setting , completely different image present eye , investigator visual system , analogous diplopic vision , able fuse image stimulus . Instead , phenomenon call binocular rivalry occurs . Here , image see alternate brain switch back forth image . The aim present study investigate effect objective change image quality investigator subjective stereoscopic perception . This psychophysiological test do look different image thereafter subjective grading image quality . The investigator hypothesize overlap image modification occur eye detect immediately , change , rotate 90 degree , suppress result one stereoscopic image , reduce image quality . Whether also account detailed image , read card , questionable .</brief_summary>
