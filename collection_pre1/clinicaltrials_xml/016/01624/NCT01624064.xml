	<detailed_description>End Stage Kidney Disease ( ESKD ) result reduce life expectancy , quality life increase consumption health care resource . Chronic Kidney Disease Uncertain aetiology ( CKDu ) increasingly recognize North Central Region Sri Lanka certain region 25 % ( unpublished data ) general population suspect suffer CKDu . The number patient reach ESKD require hemodialysis transplantation increase , highlight need find strategy slow progression kidney disease . The need strategy even critical Sri Lanka dialysis prefer treatment option . Treatment strategy readily accessible cheap . The importance proteinuria significant risk factor ESKD well recognize , treatment target reduce proteinuria show reduce progression renal disease . The Renin - Angiotensin - Aldosterone - System ( RAAS ) directly involve regulation blood pressure , fluid volume , vascular response injury inflammation . The inappropriate activation system cause hypertension , fluid retention , inflammatory , thrombotic , atherogenic effect may contribute end-organ damage long term . Angiotensin II mediate hemodynamic effect well inflammation fibrosis kidney , heart , vasculature . Numerous clinical trial establish interruption RAAS cascade angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) beneficial slow progression renal disease . Reduction BP lower proteinuria , use ACEI ARB reduce proteinuria rate deterioration renal function beyond see equivalent BP reduction conventional antihypertensive agent . However , use agent limitation , significant number treat patient still demonstrate progressive renal disease . RAAS blocker show blunt progression advance kidney disease . However long-term renal effect agent early renal disease well demonstrate . In fact trial show benefit RAAS blocker show glomerular disease evidence strong tubulo-interstitial disease . The benefit RAS inhibition seem depend degree proteinuria baseline . It marginal low grade proteinuria . In form proteinuric chronic renal disease , glomerular filtration rate continue decline even initial insult remove . The cause CKDu still unknown . CKDu tubulo-interstitial disease low grade proteinuria . We believe place ACEI secondary prevention CKDu progression need investigation</detailed_description>
