	<brief_summary>The goal first part clinical research study learn deliver accurate radiation treatment tumor spine . Researchers also want learn internal organ might move radiation treatment . The goal second part study learn safe allow slightly radiation normal esophagus spinal tumor close treat . This may result good tumor control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Using Implanted Fiducial Markers Assess Treatment Accuracy Esophageal Toxicity Spinal Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 10 participant enrol first part study , 2 group 10 participant enrol second part study . Only participant receive single spinal SBRT treatment eligible second part study . The participant first part study receive standard dose radiation therapy normal organ treat tumor . In second part study , new group receive high dose radiation esophagus group , intolerable side effect see . Radiation Planning Treatment : Before start radiation treatment , ask complete questionnaire symptom might drug take . It take 10 minute complete . After treatment , give copy questionnaire take , ask fill 1 time week next 4 week . You return questionnaire mail . Self-addressed stamped envelope give . During radiation treatment , image take treatment closely analyzed treatment . You 1 3 radiation treatment session depend doctor 's decision . If second part study , receive slightly radiation usual normal esophagus . The rest radiation treatment plan treatment delivery appointment unchanged . The dose give tumor number treatment receive determine doctor , affect take part study . Follow-Up Visits : After radiation treatment schedule end , return follow-up visit follow time point : - At 3 month - Then , every 3 month 1 year - Every 6 month year 2 , - 1 time year , long possible Additional follow visit may schedule , doctor think need . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Any updates medical history record ask side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Your complete symptom questionnaire review . - You physical , include measurement vital sign - You neurological exam . - You follow-up image ( MRI ) check status disease . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . It consider investigational give increase radiation esophagus . Up 57 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
