	<brief_summary>Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient . Gains muscle mass difficult achieve COPD unless specific metabolic abnormality target . The investigator recently observe alteration protein metabolism present normal weight COPD patient . Elevated level protein synthesis breakdown rate find COPD group indicate alteration already present muscle wasting occur . The investigator recently observe order enhance protein anabolism , manipulation composition proteins amino acid nutrition require normal-weight COPD . Intake casein protein result significant protein anabolism patient . The anabolic response casein protein even high whey protein intake . A substantial number COPD patient , underweight well normal weight obese , characterize increased inflammatory response . This group fail respond nutritional therapy . Previous experimental research clinical study cachectic condition ( mostly malignancy ) indicate polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) able attenuate protein degradation improve anabolic response feed decrease acute phase response . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) ( combination docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) show effectively inhibit weight loss several disease state , however weight muscle mass gain present minimal . Until , limit research do examine muscle protein metabolism response EPA DHA supplementation patient COPD . It investigator 's hypothesis supplementation 2g/day EPA+DHA COPD patient 4 consecutive week increase muscle anabolic response high quality protein supplement compare placebo , supplementation 3.5g/day EPA+DHA increase anabolic response even . In present study acute chronic effect EPA+DHA versus placebo muscle whole body protein metabolism examine . The principal endpoint extent stimulation net fractional muscle protein synthesis principal mechanism effect EPA+DHA muscle anabolism measure . The endpoint assess isotope methodology think reference method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aim 1 : To test hypothesis supplementation 3.5g EPA+DHA increase acute net fractional muscle protein synthesis COPD patient compare healthy control response high quality protein supplement . Specific aim 2 : To test hypothesis 3.5g/day EPA+DHA 4 consecutive week induce high increase net fractional muscle protein synthesis response high quality protein supplement compare 2g/day EPA+DHA COPD patient . Therefore , answer specific aim study COPD subject undergo 4-week intervention period .</detailed_description>
