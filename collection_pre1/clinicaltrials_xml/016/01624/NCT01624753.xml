	<brief_title>Fibered Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging Patients With Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse parenchymal lung disease ( DPLD ) represent large heterogeneous group disorder encompass collection pulmonary disease affect interstitium include alveolar epithelium , pulmonary capillary endothelium , basement membrane , perivascular perilymphatic tissue . This spectrum disease encounter pulmonary medicine collection idiopathic condition , also transplant medicine ( solid organ haematological ) , infectious disease ( atypical pneumonia ) rheumatology ( connective tissue disease/vasculitis ) . Although new technique high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) insight pathogenesis lead good understanding DPLD , clinical diagnosis , management prognostication remain challenge . The current diagnostic standard DPLD correlation clinical course , radiological feature HRCT pathological finding . Even idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) typical usual interstitial pattern HRCT pathognomonic without requirement pathology , diagnostic 80 % patient , atypical pattern HRCT preclude diagnosis IPF . As final diagnosis often hinge histopathological confirmation traditionally require surgical lung biopsy general anaesthetic via thoracoscopy thoracotomy . This entail significant morbidity mortality group patient already respiratory compromise . Minimally invasive endoscopic procedure bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) transbronchial lung biopsy ( TBLB ) via flexible bronchoscopy increasingly use majority case substitute surgical biopsy . This unfortunately entirely benign procedure either - BAL worsen hypoxaemia , TBLB may lead significant bleed pneumothorax around 5 % patient . Furthermore , diagnostic yield TBLB severely limit small size tissue blind nature choose target bronchopulmonary segment biopsy . Other limitation include significant inter-observer variation interpretation histology , problem `` sample error '' : possibility biopsy specimen take area representative predominant disease process . These limitation reflect low diagnostic yield report - immunocompromised patient , diagnostic yield either BAL TBLB 38 % 13 % complication rate , diagnostic yield &lt; 50 % TBLB report hypersensitivity pneumonitis 30 % usual interstitial pneumonia . A definitive diagnosis essential management diffuse parenchymal lung disease . Infectious aetiology necessitate antimicrobial therapy immune mediate cause manage immunosuppression . Drug induce pathology require revision current medication fibrotic condition manage expectantly . Prognostication also markedly alter aetiology diagnosis . The gap current medical practice availability minimally invasive procedure complication high diagnostic fidelity . Fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy ( FCFM ) ( CellvizioR Lung , MaunaKea Technologies , France ) new , safe minimally invasive technique use obtain real time high-resolution , microstructural image lobular alveolar lung structure live human . FCFM provide clear , in-focus image thin section within biological sample , microscope 's objective replace flexible fiberoptic miniprobe . The technique make possible obtain high-quality image endogenous exogenous tissue fluorophores , fiberoptic probe 1.4mm diameter introduce work channel standard , flexible bronchoscope . This could potentially provide diagnostic information fibrosis inflammation distal air space associate diffuse parenchymal lung disease without need lung biopsy . Current data imaging pulmonary FCFM available normal alveoli smoker non-smokers . Pathological lung FCFM imaging DPLD yet publish . In patient schedule bronchoscopy part regular clinical care/diagnostic workup , investigator offer patient concurrent fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy image perform bronchoscopic procedure . The investigator aim identify catalogue distinct discriminate feature see image obtain FCFM group patient , correlate finding specific HRCT feature pathological finding available . The investigator hope able demonstrate reproducibility FCFM image interpretation , minimal intra inter observer variability high Kappa value . Eventually investigator hope define diagnostic criterion pattern FCFM image interpretation correlate specific DPLD entity , thereby create atlas FCFM DPLD . This would enhance current diagnosis management DPLD minimal additional risk patient .</detailed_description>
