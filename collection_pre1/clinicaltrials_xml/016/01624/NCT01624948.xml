	<brief_summary>This study examine safety efficacy convert anti-rejection therapy mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) Zortress ( everolimus ) renal transplant recipient BK virus infection . The study also determine immune monitoring test detect association BK virus infection transplant rejection episode , base specific BKV infection treatment regimen . The investigator hypothesize anti-rejection regimen Zortress ( everolimus ) tacrolimus + prednisone superior standard regimen reduce dose MPA tacrolimus + prednisone patient undergone renal transplantation active BKV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Everolimus Treat BK Virus Infection Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study design single center , randomize , open-label trial study compare safety efficacy MPA discontinuation addition Zortress ( everolimus ) versus standard immunosuppression reduction adult patient undergone renal transplant evidence BKV infection . All kidney transplant recipient University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) screen BKV urine plasma month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 post-transplantation . The presence viruria &gt; 1 million copies/mL and/or viremia prompt 50 % reduction MPA dose well monthly monitoring BKV urine plasma . Renal transplant patient find BK viruria &gt; 1 million copies/mL and/or viremia &gt; 500 copies/mL screen lab eligible enrollment . Before study-related evaluation perform , patient must give write informed consent . Once consent obtain , patient randomize consecutive block 10 , 5 patient allocate group block . Only study coordinator access block sequence . Patients randomize one two group : group 1 undergo MPA discontinuation addition Zortress ( everolimus ) current regimen tacrolimus prednisone ; group 2 undergo 50 % dose reduction MPA continue tacrolimus prednisone . The two group follow : All patient group 1 undergo discontinuation MPA receive Zortress ( everolimus ) start dose 0.75 mg PO b.i.d . ( 1.5 mg/day ) . Everolimus whole blood trough level monitor pre-specified time point achieve range 3-8 ng/mL . Group 1 patient continue prednisone tacrolimus target whole blood trough level 3-6 ng/mL . Group 2 patient continue tacrolimus ( target trough level 6-10 ng/mL ) , prednisone , undergo 50 % reduction MPA dose . At month 1 , 2 , 3 post-randomization urine plasma BKV level re-checked . Renal allograft biopsy do cause clinically indicate . Tacrolimus trough level low Zortress ( everolimus ) arm order minimize potential nephrotoxicity drug combination well minimize risk over-immunosuppression . In patient , routine transplant monitoring lab perform monthly part standard care include measurement blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) creatinine ( Cr ) , complete blood count ( CBC ) , tacrolimus trough level , urine protein excretion fast lipid . During 3 month treatment period patient see clinic baseline month 1 , 2 , 3 follow-up . The assessment address primary objective perform end treatment period ( Month 3 ) . An interim analysis perform 50 % enrollment reach . In sub-group patient ( 30 patient total ; 15 group 1 15 group 2 ) use whole-blood assay measure p70S6 kinase phosphorylation , investigator investigate correlation inhibition p70S6 kinase phosphorylation BKV replication . Finally , measure p70S6 phosphorylation inhibition well expression nuclear factor activate T cell ( NFAT ) -regulated gene Interleukin ( IL ) -2 , interferon gamma GM-CSF , investigator correlate rejection episode patient maintain low immunosuppression alone versus Zortress ( everolimus ) -based regimen . As patient assign intervention group base randomization scheme offer enrollment sub-group analysis . All patient sequentially enrol sub-group analysis 30 subject goal reach 15 subject per group .</detailed_description>
