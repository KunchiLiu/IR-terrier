	<brief_summary>The global loss muscle mass strength associate age cause functional impairment disability , particularly frail elderly . Respiratory function severely compromised decrease respiratory ( RM ) strength complicate presence comorbidities physical immobility . Previous study show specific RM training effective method increase RM strength , healthy people patient . In case , specific RM training may regard beneficial alternative improve RM function , thus prevent physical clinical deterioration population . The hypothesis specific RM training would improve RM strength endurance experimental group vs. control participate RM training . Institutionalized elderly people inability walk randomly allocate control group , Threshold group Pranayama group . Both experimental group perform supervised RM training , five day week six consecutive week . The maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure ( MIP MEP ) maximum voluntary ventilation ( MVV ) assess four time point three group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies show general aerobic exercise training accompany significant respiratory physiological benefit , include gain RM strength endurance ( Larson , et al. , 1999 ; Sheel , 2002 ; Watsford , et al. , 2005 ; Lacasse et al. , 2006 ) . This benefit appear great general exercise conditioning combine specific RM training ( Weiner , et al. , 1992 ; Wanke , et al. , 1994 ; Larson , et al. , 1999 ; Hill Eastwood , 2005 ; O'Brien , et al. , 2008 ) . However , many frail elderly able perform general aerobic exercise , related ADL , mention ( e.g. , institutionalize elderly comorbidities , functional impairment RM weakness ) . In case , specific RM training may use beneficial alternative maintain improve RM function ( Watsford Murphy , 2008 ) , thus prevent deterioration functionally impair elderly . The commonly use technique specific RM training : ) isocapnic hyperpnoea ( Leith Bradley , 1976 ; Belman Mittman , 1980 ) , b ) respiratory resistive loading ( Pardy , et al. , 1981 ; Sonne Davis , 1982 ; Belman , et al. , 1986 ) , c ) respiratory threshold loading ( Clanton , et al. , 1985 ; Chen , et al. , 1985 ; Martyn , et al. , 1987 ; Larson , et al. , 1988 ) . Apart three well-known technique , less studied type exercise control breathing exercise Yoga , Pranayama , may also add list ( Kulpati , et al. , 1982 ; Manocha , et al. , 2002 ; Donesky-Cueco , et al. , 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
