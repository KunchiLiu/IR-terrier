	<brief_summary>The purpose study treat prospectively document clinic patient treatment-refractory multiple sclerosis naïve alemtuzumab . Alemtuzumab show efficacy rate serious adverse event ( SAEs ) equivalent good standard care treatment strategy use previously treatment-refractory multiple sclerosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Alemtuzumab Treatment Refractory MS Subjects/Alemtuzumab Naive &amp; Alemtuzumab Experienced Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Alemtuzumab manifest efficacy ( e.g . improve MS Severity score , treatment stability relapse rate Expanded Disability Status Scale [ EDSS ] progression ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) equivalent good standard care treatment strategy use prior treatment treatment-refractory multiple sclerosis . Objectives Treat prospectively document clinic patient treatment-refractory multiple sclerosis naïve alemtuzumab . Obtain retrospective disability , relapse , adverse event alemtuzumab-experienced subject previously treat outside clinical trial setting treatment-refractory MS . Obtain prospective safety efficacy data multiple sclerosis symptom , disability , adverse effect follow use alemtuzumab treatment-refractory MS population exposure prior cytotoxic monoclonal antibody therapy . Transition alemtuzumab-experienced clinic patient clinical trial set additional treatment alemtuzumab need refractory MS. Coprimary outcome : change EDSS convert EDSS MS Severity scale . Secondary outcome : change annualized relapse rate , day high dose corticosteroid , MRI-based cerebral volume burden disease ( select subject ) , serious adverse event , corticosteroid use . A questionnaire use assess patient satisfaction alemtuzumab compare prior therapy . Safety outcome assess tabulate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This trial treat subject relapse variant MS , include relapsingremitting , progressiverelapsing , transitional , secondary progressive MS , amenable aggressive therapy , prior relapse , EDSS 2.57.0 inclusive . Most generally moderate severe disability EDSS &gt; 3 ( EDSS 2.53 significant cognitive complaint MRI activity ) . Alemtuzumab experience subject EDSS level previously treat alemtuzumab outside clinical trial also eligible . Inclusion Criteria Alemtuzumab Experienced Subjects : All clinic patient treat alemtuzumab clinic method offer participation study , may leave study desire collection data . Subjects wish sign inform consent move region unable see personally may interview telephone include database signing informed consent . Subjects exclude purely slowly progressive definite primary progressive MS ( e.g . slowly progressive corticosteroid unresponsive myelopathy ) document recent relapse , advanced age ( 75 year ) , legal minor status , recognize contraindication alemtuzumab ( active infection , malignancy ( consider surgical cure oncologist basal cell carcinoma ) , uncontrolled bleeding disorder , plan pregnancy immediate future unwillingness use contraception , another alemtuzumab clinical trial . Prior autoimmunity remission control consider investigator 's discretion . Our clinic experience prior Grave 's disease contraindication alemtuzumab therapy . We previously exclude patient alemtuzumab basis humoral immune marker ( e.g . antithyroid ) , therefore plan perform test screen .</criteria>
