Practical apply knowledge large unselected population need guide practice policy quality improvement cost reduction . To investigate treatment pattern outcome AMI patient past decade China , use stratify two-stage cluster sample design , 175 sample hospital , 13,900 AMI case select 2011 , 6,950 2001 2006 separately . Photocopies 27,800 medical record AMI case send national coordinating centre . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract well trained professional abstractor . By characterize difference patient ' feature , compare use medication procedure , examine in-hospital outcome , 'll define gap clinical practice guideline , well disparities across different region hospital , evaluate treatment pattern outcome last decade China . New knowledge generate AMI management China , provide evidence policy-making clinical guideline , improve AMI patient prognosis future finally .</detailed_description>
