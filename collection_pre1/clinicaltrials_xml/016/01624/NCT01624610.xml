Aims : Primary Objective : -Compare proportion patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ) report adequate relief Diet 1 v Diet 2 Secondary Objectives : - Assess effect diet patient diarrhea-predominant IBS gastrointestinal microbiota blood base biomarkers . - Compare efficacy Diet 1 v Diet 2 patient diarrhea-predominant IBS pre-specified clinical quality life endpoint . Methods : This prospective randomize control trial adult meet Rome III criterion irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea ( IBS-D ) . After 2 week screen period randomization , severity symptom assess eligibility determine , patient randomize Diet 1 v Diet 2 period 4 week . The primary endpoint comparison proportion patient group report adequate relief IBS symptom . For secondary clinical outcome , responder definition incorporate abdominal pain stool consistency propose FDA utilized . Key IBS-D symptom assess daily adequate relief IBS-D symptom assess weekly randomization period . We also determine difference detect high probability relative abundance variety specific bacterial taxon two group 4 week dietary intervention . In addition , blood sample collect randomization measure relevant biomarkers immune activation .</detailed_description>
