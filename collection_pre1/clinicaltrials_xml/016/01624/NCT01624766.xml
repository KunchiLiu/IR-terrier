	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Afinitor ( everolimus ) either Kineret ( anakinra ) Xgeva ( denosumab ) give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug also study . Everolimus design stop cell divide . Anakinra designate block protein involve tumor development , new blood vessel grow , spread cancer . Denosumab design block activity protein , may prevent bone complication cancer spread bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra Denosumab Everolimus Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Dose escalation : If find eligible take part study , doctor decide receive everolimus anakinra everolimus denosumab . Once decided combination receive , assign dose level base join study . Up 3 dose level everolimus anakinra test . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . This continue high tolerable dose everolimus anakinra find . One ( 1 ) dose level everolimus denosumab test first . Participants receive high dose level . This dose level already give off-study clinical practice , researcher experience . If intolerable side effect see , 4 low dose level may study . Each new group participant receive low dose group . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . This continue high tolerable dose everolimus denosumab find . Dose expansion : Once high tolerable dose everolimus either anakinra denosumab find , 14 participant may enrol study safety combination drug dose level effectiveness study drug certain tumor group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take everolimus mouth time every day without food , swallow whole glass water . If receive anakinra , receive injection skin either upper arm , upper thigh , stomach time every day . The study doctor nurse teach give injection . If receive denosumab , receive injection skin either upper arm , upper thigh , stomach Day 1 cycle . Study Visits : On Day 15-21 Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record , include cancer symptom . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Urine may collect routine test study doctor think need . Before start Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history record , include cancer sign symptom . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . - Urine may collect routine test . Before every odd cycle start Cycles 3 , 5 , beyond : -Blood ( 1/2 tablespoon ) drawn check immune system . Every 8 week , x-ray , CT scan , MRI , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . After least 6 month take study drug , may CT , MRI , and/or PET/CT scan blood drawn every 12 week ( every 3 cycle ) study doctor think need . If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test start study cycle . If receive combination everolimus denosumab , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may draw often check mineral level study doctor think need . Length Dosing : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-up Visit : You follow-up-visit within 30 day last dose study drug . You ask current health problem may side effect . If study doctor think need , may follow-up long period time . This investigational study . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treat pancreatic cancer gotten bad , advanced renal cell carcinoma , type brain tumor call subependymal giant cell astrocytoma . Anakinra FDA approve commercially available treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Denosumab FDA approve commercially available prevent bone problem patient solid tumor spread bone . The combination everolimus either anakinra denosumab treat advance cancer investigational . Up 147 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
