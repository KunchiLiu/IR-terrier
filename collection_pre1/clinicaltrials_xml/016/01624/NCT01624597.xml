	<detailed_description>With long-range goal reduce crash related injury among teen driver , project assess influence parent-focused intervention teen ' drive safety behavior . This randomize controlled trial evaluate intervention integrate in-vehicle video feedback system parent-based communication technique improve teen driving . This first rigorous evaluation technology , well first integrate parent component . The in-vehicle video system record video clip whenever abrupt change speed steer direction detect . These event-triggered video clip cod identify safety-relevant event like drive error safety behavior . A randomized group parent receive weekly `` drive report card '' summarize drive error , safety behavior , crash near-crashes record in-vehicle system . A second group randomize parent receive report card plus training communication strategy specifically design improve parent-teen communication safe driving ( base Motivational Interviewing ) . Driving error safety behavior compare control group receive feedback in-vehicle video system . The specific aim propose project : Specific Aim 1 : Identify give parent feedback teen 's driving performance skill well communicate teen driver increase quality quantity parental involvement teen drive . Hypothesis : The intervention group report frequent higher-quality communication safe drive control group . Specific Aim 2 : Identify give parent feedback teen 's driving performance skill well communicate teen driver decrease frequency drive error , unsafe driving behavior , crash , near crash . Hypothesis : The intervention group significantly reduce risky driving event ( drive error , crash , near crash ) significantly increase safety behavior ( safety belt use drive without distraction ) control group .</detailed_description>
