	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose dinaciclib give together epirubicin hydrochloride ( epirubicin ) patient metastatic ( cancer spread part body ) triple-negative breast cancer . Dinaciclib design stop cancer cell divide new cancer cell . Epirubicin design block way cancer cell grow divide may slow stop cancer cell spread throughout body . Researchers want find high tolerable dose experimental drug dinaciclib give combination epirubicin patient metastatic triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dinaciclib Epirubicin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dinaciclib give combination epirubicin patient metastatic triple negative breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine predictive value myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein ( MCL-1 ) , low molecular weight cyclin E ( LMW-E ) , tumor grade predictor biologic response ( i.e . induction apoptosis ) tumor treat therapy . II . To evaluate efficacy combination therapy . III . To determine effect therapy proliferation measure proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki67 ) apoptosis measure terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT ) -mediated dUTP nick end label assay ( TUNEL ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dinaciclib . Patients receive dinaciclib intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 epirubicin hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
