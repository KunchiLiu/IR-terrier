	<brief_summary>This study evaluate daily use unique daily organ track system target localization patient treat radiation therapy radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . Improved coverage target volume radiotherapy could result improved cancer control rate decrease coverage surround structure potentially decrease treatment toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily Target Guided Radiation Therapy Using Calypso 4D Localization System Patients Who Have Had Prostatectomy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study evaluate clinical utility novel real-time localization system prostate bed adjuvant salvage radiotherapy radical prostatectomy . This study also determine position error use daily cone-beam compute tomography patient set Calypso 4D Localization System . Subjects BeaconÂ® Transponders implant prostate bed . The Calypso 4D Localization System localize position prostate bed . Cone beam CT use daily measure inter-transponder distance . The Calypso system also track prostate bed position real time entire radiation treatment . The treatment adjust required ensure accurate treatment clinical target volume . The time , number , extent adjustment record analysis . Daily cone-beam compute tomography image also retrospectively analyzed ass adequate target coverage . The analysis perform retrospectively manual 3-D registration cone-beam CT dataset treatment plan CT scan . This information determine margin necessary PTV use Calypso 4D Localization System potentially may allow reduction PTV volumes future study .</detailed_description>
