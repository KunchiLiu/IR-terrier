	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) may one press problem face country around world population ages.AD slowly evolve process like begin year decades clinical symptom area manifest . However , one would like identify disease process earlier point clinical continuum , precision diagnosis reduce . Therefore , challenge try identify process pre-dementia stage enhance specificity clinical diagnosis use image biomarkers . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) represent attempt characterize subject early clinical phase AD subject MCI target prevention trial . There two pathological landmark , term extra-cellular senile plaque intracellular neurofibrillary tangle . Although present symptomatic treatment provide benefit patient AD , solution AD . Up date , still therapies alter underlying nature AD process . Therefore , early intervention take place , presumably , great protection neuronal damage appreciated.The Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiate ( ADNI ) consortium universities medical center United States Canada establish develop standardized image technique biomarkers procedure normal subject , subject MCI subject mild AD . ADNI groundbreaking project , establish pre-competitive collaboration real-time data share among academia industry investigator clarify relationship among demographic , genetic , clinical , cognitive , neuroimaging biochemical measure throughout course AD neurobiology , order facilitate development effective therapeutics.This project exceed expectation , provide insight disease mechanisms well hugely valuable advance , base primarily use standardized biomarkers , drug development program . A number leading disease-modifying drug development program employ ADNI methodology toward efficient trial design , particularly critically important early ( pre-dementia ) AD population</brief_summary>
