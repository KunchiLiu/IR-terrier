	<brief_title>A Study Assess Dose-Response , Efficacy ( Immunogenicity ) Safety GC1109</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Step 1 Primary objective Investigate optimum volume GC1109 compare subject ratio seroconversion Anti-PA Ab TNA 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time immunogenicity treatment ( GC1109 placebo cohort ) healthy adult . In healthy adult , three time clinical dose four week , compare immunogenicity treatment group ( GC1109 group placebo group ) subsects ratio Seroconversion Anti-PA Ab TNA Secondary objective - Percentage subject seroconversion anti-PA IgG level ( ELISA ) 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time healthy adult - Check Seroprotection antibody titer ( survival rate : 50 % ) passive immune ( nonclinical test ) 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time healthy adult - Establish Seroconversion rate percentage subject seroconversion 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time seroprotection antibody titer healthy adult - Compare immunogenicity treatment GMT 's assessment Anti-PA Ab TNA 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time - Compare immunogenicity treatment GMT 's assessment Anti-PA IgG ELISA 4 week follow infuse drug 3 time - Determine safety treatment cohort 2 . Step 2 Primary objective Evaluate immunogenicity GC1109 4 week follow infuse optimal dose drug 3 time , whether data induce Step 1 satisfy Seroconversion rate . Secondary objective - Establish safety desirable level GC1109 's dosage healthy adult - Establish GMT Anti-PA Ab TNA infuse drug 3 time 4 week healthy adult - Establish GMT Anti-PA IgG ELISA infuse drug 3 time 4 week healthy adult</detailed_description>
