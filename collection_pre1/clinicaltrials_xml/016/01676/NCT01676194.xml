	<brief_summary>The hope treat patient hepatocellular carcinoma successfully however tempered shortage donor lead increase wait time liver transplantation ( LT ) . Intention-to-treat analysis show reported excellent long-term outcome curtail significantly hamper grow incidence patient must remove wait list tumor progression . A way face issue treat hepatocellular carcinoma prior LT . Among therapeutic option impede tumor progression , Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) common modality use . While many study concern TACE setting , none control study thus firm evidence concern efficacy reduce drop-out increase survival . Moreover TACE may induce risk ( liver failure , arterial complicationsâ€¦ ) wait LT . Most available data base upon analysis patient receive transplant include patient eligible LT die , show progression , could perform . Therefore , study conduct intention-to-treat basis need clarify benefit risk TACE prior LT patient hepatocellular carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization Prior Transplantation Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Multicentre , prospective , randomize , 2 parallel group study - Preoperative evaluation hepatocellular carcinoma recipient : Tumor diagnosis mainly base upon EASL guideline . HCCs classify accord UCSF criterion ( size , number nodule ) . Clinical biological status update every 3 month . - Pre-transplant treatment : TACE group : An emulsion Lipiodol cytotoxic drug ( 50mg/m2 doxorubicin ) inject selectively possible . Then , embolic agent use assure stop flow . The first injection perform within 10 day follow enlisting repeat every 8 week LT ( hypervascularized vital tumor tissue visible CT Scan liver function remain within Child A stage ) complete response . Clinical/biological follow-up do month . Control group ( treatment LT ) : clinical/biological follow-up CT-scan every 3 month . This prospective , multicentric , randomize study may allow investigator show TACE DC-BeadsR significantly increase intention treat survival patient transplant HCC . We also expect result associate less recurrence cancer transplantation . Obviously , expect beneficial effect TACE associate acceptable rate complication relate procedure . - Pathologic examination : In patient LT perform , diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma confirm histological examination explanted liver . - Dropout criterion : Patients progression still meet transplant criterion maintain respective group . Patients progression transplant criterion exclude wait list censor .</detailed_description>
