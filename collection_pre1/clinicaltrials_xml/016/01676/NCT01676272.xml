	<brief_summary>Despite widespread use advance biologics treatment diabetic foot ulcer , data compare one type modality another scarce . This investigation prospective randomize study compare bioengineered skin substitute human skin allograft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi Center Site , Controlled Trial Comparing Bioengineered Skin Substitute Human Skin Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal treat DFU obtain wound closure . Healing lengthy painful process ulcer diabetic etiology . Healing often complicate subject diabetes vascular compromise peripheral ischemia , renal insufficiency diminution inflammatory responses The two product compare study commonly use treatment diabetic foot ulcer . DermaGraft consider medical device FDA , clear treatment diabetic foot ulcer 1997 . It staple treatment diabetic foot ulcer , widely use throughout United States . It compose absorbable substrate seed live human fibroblast . Once form , graft cryopreserved reach clinic , defrost apply wound surface . TheraSkin compose split thickness skin graft harvest within 24 hour post-mortem , organ donor clear standard safety screening . It classify FDA donate tissue . Once harvest , graft sanitize accord FDA specification , cryopreserved , deliver clinic application foot ulcer . It also widely use treatment diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>
