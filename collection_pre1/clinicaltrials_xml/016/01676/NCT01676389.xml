	<detailed_description>Autism complex neuro-developmental disorder early childhood onset characterize impairment core triad social interaction , repetitive-stereotypes behavior , verbal/nonverbal communication . This major public health concern exert enormous toll quality life affect individual , family , society .

Complementary alternative medical treatment ( CAM ) commonly use individual wide variety medical disease include autism despite little evidence-based support efficacy . Recent survey reveal prevalence CAM use child autism 30 % 95 % . Osteopathic Manual Medicine ( OMM ) one well study CAM treatment , achieve widen acceptance increase evidence safety efficacy , adjunct treatment number condition . OMM appear safe treatment modality pediatric population administer physician expertise OMM . At physiologic level , OMM propose elicit therapeutic biomechanical effect ability mobilize body fluid , increase removal metabolic waste , boost immune function . OMM show favorable effect neuro-endocrine immunologic function . As theory autism pathogenesis often revolve around immune dysregulation include lower IgA level , accumulation metabolic xenobiotic agent , theoretical mechanism OMM exert therapeutic effect . In practice , OMM show improve sensory motor performance neurological problem , include autism . Additionally , study manual medicine technique similar principle OMM , include Qigong massage Tuina , yield favorable outcome number core autistic feature include social , language , sensory , cognition self-care domain measure Autism Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) Functional Independence Measures Children ( WeeFIM ) . 30 subject randomize receive OMM sham treatment . Standardized assessment tool autism symptom severity ( ABC WeeFIM ) administer pre- post-study compare treatment efficacy arm . Saliva sample collect pre- post-treatment session evaluate biochemical response catalog genetic marker could provide insight subset exhibit differential response .</detailed_description>
