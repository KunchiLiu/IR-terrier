	<brief_summary>The objective experiment : - Primary : To determine effect tyrosine supplementation orthostatic hypotension people PD . - Secondary : To determine effect tyrosine supplementation people PD autonomic insufficiency HR , BP , norepinephrine response acute exercise stress . Orthostatic hypotension autonomic abnormality common problem individual suffer PD , especially lead lightheadedness fall . For affected , drastically reduce quality life . It hypothesize tyrosine may impact upon individual suffer PD . There ample evidence animal model support theory ; however clinical evidence impact tyrosine supplementation may PD patient suffer orthostatic hypotension blunt BP HR response . Positive finding supplemental tyrosine increase BP HR people PD daily activity stand chair walk lead new therapy improve Parkinsonian orthostatic hypotension . Hypothesis We test hypothesis symptomatic individual PD dopamine therapy suffer orthostatic hypotension blunt HR BP responses improve tyrosine supplementation .</brief_summary>
