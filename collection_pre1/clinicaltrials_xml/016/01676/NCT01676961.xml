	<brief_title>Romiplostim Increasing Low Platelet Counts Patients With Multiple Myeloma Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Nplate ( romiplostim ) capable increase platelet count &gt; 50 x 10^9/L great 2 week myeloma patient chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity romiplostim patient population standard Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) . II . To determine increase thrombosis marrow fibrosis . OUTLINE : Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 6 week . Patients achieve platelet count &gt; 50 x 10^9 receive romiplostim weekly 1 course chemotherapy may continue long benefit see . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
