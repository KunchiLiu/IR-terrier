	<brief_summary>This `` proof concept '' study , assess feasibility introduce novel high-precision radiotherapy technique call `` stereotactic radiosurgery '' ( SRS ) `` stereotactic body radiotherapy '' ( SBRT ) treatment kidney cancer Australia . This study aim invite 20 patient renal cell carcinoma 10 patient isolated adrenal metastasis non-small cell carcinoma either medically inoperable , high risk surgery , decline surgery participate . In cohort patient renal cell carcinoma , patient primary disease , patient limited metastasis ( ≤5 ) eligible . Besides technical feasibility deliver treatment , study ass efficacy , toxicity tumour response use novel imaging biomarker call diffusion weighted-MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Focal Ablative STereotactic RAdiosurgery Cancers Kidney Isolated Adrenal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FASTRACK 2 -cohort , non-randomised prospective feasibility study . Anticipated total duration accrual approximately 24 month , patient expect complete protocol treatment image within 3 month . The trial close last patient complete his/her last protocol relate follow-up visit ( 12 month post-treatment ) . Cohort 1 : patient renal cell carcinoma within kidney Cohort 2 : patient solitary adrenal metastasis non-small cell lung carcinoma The investigational treatment prescribe cover isodose , ensure 99 % PTV cover 100 % dose ( D99=100 % ) . It anticipate treatment highly conformal . Treatment must deliver least six ( 6 ) non-opposing conformal megavoltage photon beam . It anticipate typical range beam number would 8 12 , comprise least 6 co-planar beam 1-2 non-coplanar beam . No cytotoxic chemotherapy allow within 3 week concurrently respect investigational treatment . Consultation treat radiation oncologist strongly recommend chemotherapy consider investigational treatment document disease progression , prevent unforeseen combine toxicity . Targeted agent ( sunitinib ) exempt recommendation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year old All patient must radiological diagnosis biopsy confirm diagnosis either : 1 . Cohort 1 : renal cell carcinoma single lesion within kidney , primary kidney tumour intact 5 documented metastasis , 2 . Cohort 2 : single adrenal metastasis extra‐adrenal disease control ECOG performance 0‐2 inclusive . Either medically inoperable , technically high risk surgery decline surgery . Informed consent . Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 week commencement treatment , concurrently treatment . Delivery target agent ( sunitinib ) allowable least 7 day separate delivery propose agent delivery stereotactic radiotherapy . Previous high‐dose radiotherapy upper abdomen</criteria>
