	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare real-world set efficacy traditional training ( today 's guideline , vigorously moderate exercise ) amount aerobic interval training ( 1-AIT ) reduction risk factor constitute metabolic syndrome . The secondary objective compare efficacy traditional moderate training ( today 's guideline ) amount aerobic interval training ( 1-AIT vs. 4-AIT ) improve aerobic capacity , cardiovascular function , skeletal muscle contractile function , skeletal muscle energy metabolism , leave ventricle systolic diastolic function rest right ventricular function . The investigator hypothesize aerobic interval training would reverse feature metabolic syndrome traditional training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study describe randomize multicenter clinical trial design test hypothesis 16-week program , one year follow vigorously exercise define today 's guideline ( perform 4-AIT ( 4x4min aerobe interval training ) ) yield large beneficial effect reduce risk factor constitute metabolic syndrome continuously moderate intensity exercise ( CME ) define today 's guideline . Furthermore , importance amount aerobic interval training remain unclear unknown little `` one get away '' still obtain substantial beneficial cardiovascular effect . Therefore , investigator also determine whether one bout AIT ( 1-AIT ( 1x4min aerobe interval training ) ) give beneficial effect compare 4-AIT CME . Evaluation criterion risk factor constitute metabolic syndrome , aerobic capacity measure peak oxygen uptake compliance intervention . Assessments make 16-week program , six month , 1 3 year follow-up . Calculations base previously result suggest total number 750 patient randomize 1:1:1 ( 250 group ) three intervention group sufficient detect large beneficial effect AIT p-value 0.05 ( two-sided test ) statistical power 0.85 ( primary endpoint reduction cardiovascular risk factor constitute metabolic syndrome ) .</detailed_description>
