	<brief_summary>Background : - Lab study help researcher well understand cancer biology . This information may lead new method diagnose treat cancer . To develop study , researcher want collect sample people cancer precancer condition lymph system . These condition include multiple myeloma , different type lymphoma , adult leukemia/lymphoma . The sample collect include blood , urine , bone marrow , tumor skin tissue . Objectives : - To collect tissue sample study different type lymph cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age lymphoid cancer precancer condition . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Different sample collect study . Blood sample collect initial testing . More blood sample collect different treatment point . Other liquid sample include urine , bone marrow , abnormal fluid . Tumor tissue skin tissue biopsy also collect study . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : An estimated 79,190 people live United States diagnose lymphoma 2012 , include 9,060 case HL , 70,130 case non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) multiple case adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . Laboratory investigation conduct Lymphoid Malignancies Branch , include analysis cellular , molecular , genetic genomic biology attempt develop new prognostic diagnostic model , therapeutic agent novel treatment approach lymphoid malignancy pre-malignant condition . Objectives : This biology protocol design allow sample acquisition use study lymphoid malignancy malignancy precursor , include limited B T cell malignancy , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) . A variety laboratory investigation conduct blood , tumor , bone marrow , urine , abnormal fluid normal tissue , include analysis cellular , molecular , genetic genomic biology support NIH translational trial develop new therapeutic agent novel treatment approach well new prognostic diagnostic model . Eligibility : Adult patient confirm pathological diagnosis lymphoid malignancy lymphoid precursor , include B-cell T-cell lymphoma : include limited diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) . Design : The purpose study examine , exploratory fashion , variety biologic assay relevant investigation lymphoid malignancy . It anticipate 60 consented subject study year . Thus , accrual ceiling 600 consented subject plan 10 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know lymphoid malignancy precursor disease lymphoid malignancy , include multiple myeloma , Bcell Tcell lymphoma : include limited diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) . Confirmation pathological diagnosis . Confirmation diagnosis require Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Tumor tissue previously collect available study collect minimal additional risk subject sampling require routine patient care require test NIH research protocol use diagnosis . Greater equal 18 year age . ECOG performance 02 . Must willing able provide inform consent . INCLUSION FOR APHERESIS : Hemoglobin great equal 10 mg/dL platelet count great 75 K/uL . Weight great 25 kilogram HIV negative Prothrombin Time within normal limit Partial Thromboplastin Time within normal limit Medically indicated central line place adequate peripheral venous access EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant breast feed woman eligible aspect protocol except phlebotomy . Active symptomatic major organ disorder would increase risk biopsy apheresis , include limited ischemic heart disease , recent myocardial infarction , active congestive heart failure , pulmonary dysfunction . Active concomitant medical psychological illness may increase risk subject inability obtain informed consent , discretion principal investigator .</criteria>
