	<brief_title>Topical Resiquimod Treatment Early Stage Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma ( CTCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-ranging study subject early stage ( IA , IB , 2A ) CTCL . Patients early stage CTCL screen eligibility . Eligible subject enrol 2 treatment group 8 subject . Treatment group : 1 . Resiquimod 0.06 % applied dosing frequency periodically adjust accord tolerability . Subjects begin dose 3 time per week ( 3x/wk ) , evaluate clinic every two week . The dosing frequency ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7x/wk ) may adjust stepwise manner two week interval base physician assessment tolerability ( maintain , increase , decrease without dose interruption [ rest period ] ) . Resiquimod apply 8 week ( COT1 ) follow 4 week no-treatment period . If subject require permanent discontinuation treatment , subject repeat second course treatment 8 week ( COT2 ) follow 4 week no-treatment period . Subjects apply 500 mg study drug per day base upon total surface area treat ( ~250 mg product / 50 cm2 lesion surface area ) . 2 . Resiquimod 0.03 % applied described Treatment Group 1 . However , initial application 5 time per week dosing frequency adjust upward tolerate every two week . The initial cohort assign Treatment Group 1 . After 4 subject complete least 4 week dose , safety review meeting conducted committee consist P.I. , biostatistician , least one physician familiar CTCL response . The Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) determine , base review tolerability data , start concentration/frequency next group 4 subject . For give subject concentration assignment ( 0.06 % 0.03 % ) remain ( frequency may vary ) . It plan approximately 8 subject enrol group . A treatment regimen consider inadequately tolerated 2 subject within treatment cohort require protocol mandate permanent discontinuation . Treatment regimens newly enrol subject and/or current subject treatment adjust accordingly per protocol . The Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) determine occurrence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , define Section 6.4.6 . A subsequent phase II study explore efficacy MTD expand study . Up 2 subject per Treatment Group discontinue study due reason unrelated safety reason ( e.g . personal , lose follow-up , etc ) may replace . The investigator determine target CTCL lesion treatment area . During COT , subject treat least 1 4 target lesion 0.06 % dose group , 5 target lesion 0.03 % treatment group total combine treatment area ≥25 cm2 ≤100 cm2 . Unless lesion consider completely resolve clinical assessment 4 week post COT1 ( PCOT1 ) , subject treat baseline target lesion throughout COT1 COT2 . The amount drug apply per dose COT may vary depend total size target lesion may exceed 500 mg per day . For COT1 , subject evaluated baseline , Week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 ( PCOT1 ) . For COT2 , subject evaluate Week 12 ( PCOT1/COT2 baseline ) 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 24 ( 4 week post COT2 , PCOT2 ) . The End study ( EOS ) PCOT2 , subject permanently discontinue study drug prematurely , 4 week last dose . Rest period treatment may institute investigator need manage tolerance , resumption treatment upon adequate resolution per investigator discretion . Subjects treatment group experience partial response complete response week 24 continue treatment another 12 week concentration . During time evaluate every 4 week 12 week . At time 4 week rest period final evaluation perform .</detailed_description>
