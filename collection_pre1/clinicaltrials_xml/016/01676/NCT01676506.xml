	<brief_title>Genetic Polymorphisms Ranibizumab Treatment Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) disease affect central part retina , call macula , associate progressive central vision loss . Moreover , AMD know lead cause blindness develop country . In wet form AMD , new abnormal blood vessel start grow choroid towards retina lead leakage vessel , turn , impaired retinal structure rapid vision loss . Genetic factor find important development wet AMD . Our previous research show association genetic polymorphism risk wet AMD well specific clinical feature disease . At present , anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) therapy intravitreous ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) consider effective treatment wet AMD . However , treatment outcome may vary significantly improve vision effect . The aim research study ranibizumab treatment outcome depend genetic factor .</detailed_description>
