	<brief_title>A Phase II Study siG12D LODER Combination With Chemotherapy Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase II study single dose 2.8 mg ( eight 0.35 mg siG12D-LODERs ) administer patient unresectable LAPC combine chemotherapy treatment ( Gemcitabine+nab-Paclitaxel ) . This first study assess response rate siG12D-LODER patient unresectable LAPC . The study two-arm design one arm receive siG12D-LODER + chemotherapy , arm receiving chemotherapy . The investigational agent siG12D-LODER miniature biodegradable bio polymeric matrix encompass drug , design produce Silenseed Ltd . The implantation LODERs select meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) biopsy procedure , prove highly effective safe . siG12D-LODER studied escalate dose Phase I study 15 patient , result show high safety tolerability profile , single DLT .</detailed_description>
