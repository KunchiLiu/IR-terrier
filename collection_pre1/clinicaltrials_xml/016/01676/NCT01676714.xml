	<detailed_description>The purpose study 1 ) evaluate clinical efficacy dovitinib 2 ) prospectively estimate prevalence fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signal alteration patient advance non-squamous non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) advance CRC progress anti-VEGF treatment . Additionally , investigator make exploratory initial observation relationship FGF signal alteration clinical activity dovitinib . This trial expect provide key biologic information inform clinical development dovitinib provide initial evaluation analytic characteristic potential predictive biomarkers efficacy .</detailed_description>
