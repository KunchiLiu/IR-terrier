	<brief_summary>Diflunisal anti-inflammatory drug ( like ASA ibuprofen ) use painkiller 20 year . Recent research show may anti-HIV effect laboratory . Approximately 20 HIV-infected adult receive antiretroviral therapy give diflunisal mouth twice daily 4 week , dose show safe use treat pain . Subjects monitor closely safety frequent blood test study see drug effect level HIV blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following informed consent , potential subject undergo screen visit determine study eligibility . Within 2 week screen , undergo Day 1 visit blood test . At Day 8 visit follow Monday , study visit procedure complete , commence take diflunisal 500 mg twice daily mouth 4 week ( Days 8-36 , study treatment period ) , see week blood test . Following last dose diflunisal take morning Day 36 , see blood test 1 week study drug ( Days 43 , washout phase ) , final visit 2 week study drug , Day 50 . Subjects instruct take diflunisal 500 mg mouth two dos approximately 12 hour apart ( + - 1 hour ) , without food . A 2-week supply dispense Days 8 22 . Study medication bottle ( empty ) return clinic Days 22 36 . Pill count performed assess adherence . Adherence evaluate measure diflunisal drug level plasma sample collect weekly start baseline visit , assayed end study . After subject provide informed consent , screen visit perform include complete medical history record concomitant medication determine study eligibility . Complete physical exam , CBC , platelet count , serum creatinine estimate GFR , serum potassium , AST , ALT , total bilirubin , CD4 cell count , pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential perform screen visit repeat final study visit . At study visit , blood drawn HIV RNA , serum sample collect stored measurement C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , d-dimer , possibly inflammatory biomarkers . Plasma ( diflunisal drug level measurement ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC 's ) collect stored weekly baseline visit Day 50 . PBMC 's frozen ship batch Eric Verdin , MD Gladstone Institute Virology Immunology ( 1650 Owens St San Francisco , CA 94158 , USA ) analysis T cell subset ( na√Øve , memory CD4 CD8 T cell ) level protein acetylation ( histone ) surrogate marker drug activity . Adverse event concomitant medication record baseline visit update weekly . After completion final study visit , subject compensate time amount $ 500 . Subjects need discontinue study early , e.g . due significant clinical laboratory adverse event relate study drug , receive full stipend end participation study . Subjects choose withdraw study early withdrawn study noncompliance eligible receive stipend . Subjects require ongoing reimbursement travel expense enable attend study visit receive advance stipend upon provide receipt park , etc .</detailed_description>
