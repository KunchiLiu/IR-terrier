	<brief_summary>By study , investigator hope learn whether patient difficult obtain IV access treat IO access satisfy care well outcomes . The investigator specifically study time difference group difference number attempt require obtain vascular access begin treat fluid medication . The study also measure patient satisfaction procedural pain , frequency central line placement , length stay hospital emergency department , adverse event intravascular access determine whether IO access improve measure . The investigator hypothesize use protocol utilize IO device select patient fail IV access reduce time requirement obtain vascular access , reduce number attempt need obtain IV access , reduce ED LOS , negative impact patient satisfaction compare current ED practice .</brief_summary>
