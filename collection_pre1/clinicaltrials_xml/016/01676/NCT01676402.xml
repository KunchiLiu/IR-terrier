	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib study healthy adult ( 18-70 year ) evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity season sequential season vaccination schedule consist 2012/2013 seasonal influenza DNA vaccine ( HA DNA ) license trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) administer intradermally ( ID ) intramuscularly ( IM ) . The hypothesis evaluation investigational schedule inform development novel influenza vaccine strategy may offer improved cross-protective immunity antigenically diverse influenza strain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seasonal Influenza HA DNA With Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine ( TIV ) Administered ID IM Healthy Adults 18-70 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccines effective way prevent influenza infection . Each year World Health Organization ( WHO ) U.S FDA recommend influenza strain include seasonal influenza vaccine . The licensed seasonal influenza vaccine direct 3 influenza virus strain : influenza A H1N1 , influenza A H3N2 , influenza B . The currently approve vaccine depend upon labor-intensive method limit manufacture speed capacity . Influenza vaccine rapidly produce induce stronger , broad persistent immune response recognize public health need . In protocol propose use DNA vaccine antigen delivery induce immune response native hemagglutinin ( HA ) structure prior boost licensed TIV ID TIV IM . The study allow evaluation safety immunogenicity season sequential season vaccination schedule . The season regimens ( 2012/13 prime boost 14 week interval ) consist HA DNA prime TIV ID boost -- -- HA DNA prime TIV IM boost . The active comparator schedule TIV ID TIV IM alone single dose TIV standard adult influenza vaccination within single season . The sequential season regimen ( 2012/13 prime 2013/14 boost ) consist concurrent administration ( different arm ) HA DNA TIV ID prime TIV ID boost -- -- HA DNA TIV IM prime TIV IM boost . The active comparator regimens TIV ID follow TIV ID boost -- -- TIV IM follow TIV IM boost , administer sequential season consistent typical pattern use license vaccine . Evaluation investigational schedule active comparator schedule inform development novel influenza vaccine strategy may offer improved cross-protective immunity diverse influenza strain .</detailed_description>
