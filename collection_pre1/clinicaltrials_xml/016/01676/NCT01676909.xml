	<detailed_description>Background : Veterans schizophrenia , serious mental illness ( SMI ) , Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) elevate risk co-occurring chronic medical condition result increase risk disability , high health care spending , reduce quality life early mortality . Physical wellness increasingly recognize key component VA 's commitment develop recovery-oriented Veteran-centered mental health treatment . There also grow recognition value intervention promote improve patient self-management chronic medical condition . Building establish efficacy consumer facilitate medical illness self-management programming use general population two recent adaptation use SMI adult public health sector ( include investigator ' evaluation intervention call Living Well ) , investigator propose complete randomize control effectiveness trial Living Well intervention simultaneously conduct well specified process evaluation optimize knowledge accrual regard important factor may improve future adoption , implementation sustainability Living Well intervention VA system care . Aims : Primary AIM 1 : Complete randomize control effectiveness trial Living Well intervention 234 Veterans mental illness least one co-occurring chronic medical condition evaluate intervention 's effect functional service relate outcomes . The investigator hypothesize randomize Living Well intervention , comparison randomize medical illness education support group , demonstrate improve general health function include physical emotional functioning well reduce rate medical emergency room visit management chronic medical condition . The investigator also evaluate intervention effect proximal attitudinal behavioral outcome assess factor mediate improvement functional service relate outcomes . Primary AIM 2 : Complete well specify process evaluation base RE-AIM evaluation framework well understand contextual factor improve Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation Maintenance together determine potential public health impact Living Well intervention . Methods : A mix temporally overlap quantitative qualitative method use maximize integration synthesis data stream across two aim optimize knowledge accrual . Impact : Despite grow recognition self-management strategy hold enormous promise improve quality outcome care chronic medical illness , fact self-management gaining prominence mental health recovery orient treatment focus , currently evidence-based peer facilitate medical illness self-management intervention available dissemination within VA mental health system . The propose study design generate evidence support effectiveness peer co-facilitated intervention help speed throughput public health impact collect important contextual information factor may improve future dissemination implementation effort .</detailed_description>
