	<brief_title>Carriage Of Multiresistant Bacteria After Travel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) among Enterobacteriaceae constitute increasingly important human health hazard worldwide . Also Netherlands AMR rate rise recent year . A limited number previous study suggest high acquisition rate AMR E. coli international travel , information travel-associated risk factor , duration colonization local transmission import AMR largely , entirely , lack . Objectives : Prospectively study influence foreign travel associate risk factor acquisition AMR endogenous microbiota healthy individual subsequent persistence AMR carriage transmission household member carrier . Examine whether carrier resistant Enterobacteriaceae high risk bacterial infection year travel ( compare non-carriers ) . Explore full width AMR gene transferable genetic element acquire international travel . Study design : multicenter longitudinal cohort study . Study population : healthy , adult ( &gt; 18 year ) volunteer travel abroad 1 week - 3 month . Non travel household member travel volunteer . Methods : Travelers non-traveling household member recruit outpatient travel clinic throughout The Netherlands . Faecal sample questionnaire take ( t=0 ) travel , immediately travel ( t=1 ) 1 month upon return ( = 2 ) . For volunteer acquire AMR Enterobacteriaceae , repeat questionnaire faecal sample take 3 , 6 12 month . Faecal sample culture screen AMR Enterobacteriaceae . Suspected colony identify susceptibility confirm standard method . Genotypic characterization extended-spectrum betalactamase- ( ESBL- ) carbapenemase gene perform use microarray gene sequence . Clonal bacterial spread within household confirm excluded molecular typing . Outcomes : The main outcome measure acquisition rate persistence AMR endogenous microbiota healthy traveler upon travel . Secondary outcome duration colonization , rate secondary transmission within household , identification risk factor , occurrence self-reported infection year follow travel abundance type resistance .</detailed_description>
