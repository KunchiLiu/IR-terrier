	<brief_title>Prevalence Extracardiac Coronary Collateral Supply Via Internal Mammary Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Surgical bypass create artificial anastomosis diseased coronary artery extracardiac vessel . Often one internal mammary artery ( IMA ) use procedure . These connection rarely describe occur naturally , represent extracardiac coronary collateral . In contrast extensively study coronary collateral circulation within heart , clinical attention pay anecdotally extracardiac-to-coronary anastomosis . Usually form case report give account angiographically visible anastomosis coronary circulation internal mammary artery ( IMA ) , typically presence chronic occlusion coronary artery . In anatomical literature , common type extracardiac anastomosis include bronchial-to-coronary-artery IMA-to-coronary-artery connection . Anastomoses IMA coronary circulation document occur 12 % post-mortem patient CAD . Importantly , hitherto exist observation typically rely visual method insensitive adequate detection especially structurally present poorly functional anastomosis . On diagnostic coronary angiogram , collateral visible recipient vessel subtotally stenotic fully occlude , render visible coronary spasm temporary balloon occlusion recipient artery simultaneous injection contrast medium artery , respectively . Similarly , macroscopic pathologic postmortem examination likely underestimate true number extracardiac coronary collateral . When present , pre-existing connection IMA coronary circulation could promote serve natural bypass diseased coronary artery . Promotion extracardiac blood flow coronary circulation rarely already attempt past . In minimally invasive intervention , bilateral surgical ligation IMA perform patient , result clinical improvement disappearance angina . However , advent coronary surgery , effort aim promotion naturally exist bypass abandon place artificially create extracardiac anastomosis coronary circulation . Yet limitation establish revascularization intervention become clear , need search alternative treatment option get evident . Therapeutic arteriogenesis promotion naturally exist bypass coronary circulation internal mammary artery present future possibility . Objective The purpose study determine vivo prevalence functional distribution IMA-to-coronary collateral supply via right leave coronary artery . Methods Comparative observational study CFI measurement IMAs ( proximal IMA occlusion ) coronary circulation ( distal IMA occlusion ) , IMA angiography distal IMA occlusion . Study Protocol - Diagnostic coronary angiography LV angiography - Administration 5'000 unit heparin i.v . 2 puffs oral isosorbide-dinitrate - Right left IMA CFI 1-minute ostial vessel occlusion - Selection coronary artery CFI accord stenotic lesion choose PCI accord ease access pressure sensor wire . Placement non-sensor wire leave IMA . Two coronary CFI measurement ( 1-minute occlusion ) : first , second without distal IMA balloon occlusion . Placement non-sensor wire right IMA . Two coronary CFI measurement : first , second without distal IMA balloon occlusion . - IMA angiography ( left right ) distal IMA coronary occlusion .</detailed_description>
