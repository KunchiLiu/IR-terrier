	<detailed_description>Rationale Bronchoscopy one important procedure diagnosis lung cancer pulmonary disease . This procedures render important anatomical information subtle change epithelium vascularity bronchial tree clue guide endoscopist procedure , especially case centrally locate lung cancer . These subtle change may influence choice treatment , site biopsy resectability cancer determine resection margin also case multifocal premalignant disease . A recently publish meta-analysis show diagnostic superiority autofluorescence bronchoscopy ( AFB ) routine white light bronchoscopy ( WLB ) . Furthermore , patient head neck cancer increase risk develop lung cancer give smoke habit . Through technological improvement new technique become available form high-definition ( HD- ) bronchoscopy . Current normal video white light bronchoscopy standard , video-autofluorescence bronchoscopy ( AFB ) offer specialized center . The impact development high-definition videobronchoscopy use 1.1 megapixel chip diagnostic performance bronchoscopy however unknown . Objective ( primary secondary outcome ) ( 1 ) Investigate sensitivity HD bronchoscopy , without surface enhancement tone enhancement comparison AFB ( 'gold standard ' ) standard WLB detect abnormality tracheobronchial tree . Furthermore aim investigate determination resection margin ( suspect ) malignancy glottic supraglottic area centrally locate lung cancer comparison autofluorescence bronchoscopy ( SAFE 3000 dual video mode ) high risk population biopsy suspect lesion identify either technique . ( 2 ) When sensitivity specificity HD videobronchoscopy either mode abovementioned study vicinity report sensitivity specificity SAFE3000 dual mode videobronchoscopy suggest use result study perform power analysis . With information may possible design new future study compare sensitivity detect premalignant lesion high risk population prospective study . Study design This study descriptive exploratory randomize observational study blind post procedure analysis diagnostic performance HD bronchoscopy comparison WLB AFB . Study population Patients schedule diagnostic therapeutic procedure general anesthesia cardiothoracic thoracic surgeon ear- , nose- throat ( ENT ) surgeon suspect proven lung cancer head neck cancer eligible exploratory study . Eligible patient ASA physical status 1-3 patient age 18 year old . Ineligibility criterion know contraindication diagnostic bronchoscopy ( bleed disorder , indication use anticoagulant therapy ( acenocoumarol , warfarin , therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin clopidogrel ) , know allergy lidocaine , know pulmonary hypertension , recent and/or uncontrolled cardiac disease ) . Presence contraindication use laryngeal mask ( anatomical abnormality , increase risk intubation ( mallampati score 4 ) , ASA classification great equal 4 . Study procedure Prior surgery ENT surgeon cardiothoracic surgeon bronchoscopy perform experienced chest physician laryngeal mask general anaesthesia . Bronchoscopy perform standardized order use five different image mode . The order different mode randomize . High-definition digital video make procedure without screen indication date , time reference study site patient identification . The five imaging mode use study : Standard white light videobronchoscopy ( WLB ) ; High Definition ( HD- ) bronchoscopy ; HD-bronchoscopy + surface enhancement ; HD-bronchoscopy + tone enhancement Auto Fluorescence Bronchoscopy ( AFB - SAFE3000 ) dual video mode . All visible abnormality suspect malignancy pre-malignancy biopsied afterwards . The HD-digital video 's reviewed experience bronchoscopists random order blind patient , study site date score use predefined score system describe surface , vascularity tumour . Premalignant lesion identify multiple technique consider non-inferior . From patient 5 HD- film generate . These film review blinded fashion random order two experienced pulmonologists independent equally experienced third pulmonologist . When new clinically relevant abnormality find normally indicate diagnostic procedure follow perform immediately completion videoregistration . All finding disclose patient physician charge investigator impact finding plan diagnostic therapeutic procedure register . Main study parameter / endpoints The bronchoscopy video score blind experienced endoscopists epithelial change , vascularity change , presence suspicion dysplasia , presence suspicion carcinoma situ , tumor margin . The study descriptive exploratory study diagnostic performance HD-bronchoscopy use different image technique comparison standard white light bronchoscopy autofluorescence bronchoscopy determine epithelial change , change vascularity tumour margin . As secondary outcome aim , difference establish different bronchoscopy mode , perform power analysis determine feasibility prospectively design study investigate diagnostic performance HD bronchoscopy . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness After start general anaesthesia plan operation laryngeal mask airway inserted anesthesiologist . Bronchoscopy perform experienced pulmonologist use routine topical anesthesics . In way burden patient risk complication low . These patient indication plan surgical procedure evaluate anesthesiologist prior procedure consider fit surgery . The total anesthesia time planned procedure increase 10 15 minute . Bronchoscopy safe diagnostic procedure , report complication general attributable te invasive diagnostic procedure perform diagnostic bronchoscopy like biopsy , lavage needle aspiration . This aim study , invasive diagnostic procedure perform case clinically relevant new finding . In general expect vast majority patient involve benefit participate study</detailed_description>
