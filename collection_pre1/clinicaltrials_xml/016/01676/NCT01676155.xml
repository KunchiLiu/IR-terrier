	<brief_title>The Role Apoptosis Associated Markers Pathogenesis Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain important infectious disease worldwide . For control TB , important strategy include adequate anti-tuberculous treatment also well control latent TB infection ( LTBI ) . Latent TB infection ( LTBI ) 10 % reactivation patient immuno-compromised disorder . Although LTBI detect interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) tuberculin skin test , predict become active TB LTBI still unclear important . In overall prophylactic treatment LTBI , lengthy duration possible serious side effect scar general application especially 90 % population may get illness . Therefore , recognize develop active TB LTBI important target prophylactic therapy . The good marker discover present . When TB bacilli arrive lung , macrohage first line defense necrosis rather apoptosis dominant form cell death , affords protective milieu M. tuberculosis . Though apoptosis suppress TB , apoptosis-associated marker rarely investigated human LTBI vs. active TB . We set cohort study detect active TB develop LTBI first-step conduct case control study compare apoptosis marker LTBI active TB evaluate apoptosis marker discriminate TB infection status . The significant marker verify cohort study LTBI patient . Hypothesis : The apoptosis-associated marker , include Fas ligand , Decoy-receptor 3 , Lipoxin , prostaglandin E2 , discriminative patient active TB LTBI thus might predict potential active TB LTBI . Study Aims : To compare serum apoptosis-associated marker patient active TB patient LTBI To evaluate efficiency apoptosis-associated marker differentiate potential active TB LTBI Methods : We prospectively enroll patient active TB ( n=100 ) LTBI ( n=100 ) , define IGRA . Blood sample would collect received definite treatment yield informed consent . We examine serum apoptosis-associated marker include Fas ligand , Decoy-receptor 3 , Lipoxin , prostaglandin E2 , cytokines chemokines serum sample supernatant T-cell TB antigen stimulation . Their clinical characteristic record . We compare laboratory clinical data two group analyze efficacy diagnostic help marker .</detailed_description>
