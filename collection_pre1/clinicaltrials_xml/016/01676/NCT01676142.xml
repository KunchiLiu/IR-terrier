	<brief_title>Establishing Diagnostic Test Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria Lung Infection Using Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria Antigen Stimulation Test : From Immune Base , Standardized Setup Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infection Nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infection ( NTM-LD ) become important clinical concern [ 1 ] rate NTM infection increase past ten year [ 2-3 ] . According study Taiwan , NTM-LD increase 1.26 7.94 per 100,000 inpatients/year 2000 2008 [ 2 ] . The reason increase readily clear , could relate growth number acquire immunocompromised population advance technique mycobacterial culture [ 4-7 ] . Among NTM infection Taiwan , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) M. abscessus ( MAB ) frequently isolate [ 2 ] . The difficulty early diagnose confirm true NTM-LD However , NTM exist environment ubiquitously , relevance ( true disease patient number number patient disease colonization ) far less 100 % varied different NTM specie . For example , previous study show presence M. kansasii MAC clinical relevance around 47~70 % 35~42 % , respectively [ 8-9 ] . As MAB emerge pathogen worldwide , relevance 33 % [ 9 ] . According contemporary NTM guideline establish American thoracic society , NTM pulmonary infection diagnose multiple criterion include microbiology respiratory specimen clinical finding well radiographic finding [ 1 ] . In microbiology criterion , two set positive sputum mycobacterial culture NTM specie within one year need . Because NTM colonization uncommon respiratory tract , diagnosis true pulmonary NTM infection great challenge clinical practice . Actually , microbiology test mycobacteria neither timely efficient . Mycobacterial culture time-consuming , need week wait result even though 's current gold standard micro-organism identification [ 10 ] . The nucleic acid amplification method polymerase chain reaction could discriminate true NTM infection solely colonization micro-organism present situation [ 11 ] . To early diagnose start treatment NTM infection important NTM pulmonary infection might rapid lethal infection intensive care unit patient receive early proper treatment [ 6 ] . In addition , MAC MAB common Taiwan resistant anti-tuberculosis regimen . Hence , rapid accurate diagnostic test develop [ 1-2 , 6 ] The help innate immunity diagnose NTM-LD The body inflammatory marker , represent immune response , would indicator differentiate true mycobacterial pulmonary infection colonization first set mycobacterial culture grow NTM [ 12-15 ] . Both interferon-gamma tumor necrosis factor-alpha play critical role protective immunity mycobacterial infection [ 16-17 ] . These response link engagement Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) critical mycobacterial infection [ 18 ] . However , TLR-2 expression evaluate patient NTM infection colonization . According success application interferon-gamma release assay tuberculosis detection [ 19 ] , understand specific immune response helpful diagnose mycobacterial infection . We therefore focus expression TLR-2 associate downstream cytokine patient MAC MAB lung disease , account NTM infection [ 2 ] . The design study diagnosis In order investigate help host immune diagnose NTM pulmonary infection , initially compare baseline expression TLR-2 downstream cytokine MAC MAB infect patient colonized subject . Then , perform in-vitro stimulation test use mycobacteria ( MAC MAB ) co-culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient . The TLR-2 expression cytokine activation examine stimulation test . We analyze expression difference NTM-LD colonization .</detailed_description>
