	<brief_title>Phase 1b Dose De-escalation Trial Dinaciclib With Pembrolizumab Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label phase Ib trial weekly dinaciclib combination every 3 week pembrolizumab patient advance breast cancer . Any number prior therapy allow . Pembrolizumab administer every 3 week fix dose 200 mg IV . Dinaciclib administer D1 D8 21 day cycle 2-hour intravenous infusion . In phase 1 , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dinaciclib monotherapy solid tumor 12 mg/m2 . The start dose level study dinaciclib 12 mg/m2 combination pembrolizumab 200 mg IV overlap toxicity expect . The dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) window 21 day ( 1 cycle ) . The dose dinaciclib escalate beyond 12 mg/m2 start dose level , dose de-escalation occur necessary follow 3+3 design . The primary objective define maximum tolerate dose dinaciclib give weekly combination schedule . The primary endpoint safety tolerability . Once MTD dinaciclib define , 20 patient dose expansion perform MTD patient metastatic locally advance unresectable triple negative breast cancer . Secondary objective include evaluation preliminary efficacy combination use RECIST 1.1 irRECIST . Exploratory study characterize correlate PDL-1 ( program death ligand-1 ) MYC ( myelocytomatosis oncogene ) overexpression clinical response perform . Tumor biopsies optional dose escalation cohort , mandatory dose expansion cohort unless otherwise specify .</detailed_description>
