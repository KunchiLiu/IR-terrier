	<brief_summary>There deficit number 'age-appropriate ' formulation available delivery medicine child . Liquid preparation consider 'gold standard ' delivering medicine child however many formulate use ingredient toxic child ( e.g . preservative , alcohol ) , particularly neonatal baby ( &lt; 4 week old ) posse metabolic process mature organ function old child adult . Rapidly dissolve oral thin film ( OTFs ) dissolve quickly saliva , release active ingredient ( ) without need chew water , make ideally suit patient find difficult swallow oral dosage form tablet capsule . The aim study demonstrate OTFs offer safe effective alternative oral administration phosphate supplement neonatal infant treatment hypophosphataemia osteopenia prematurity . It hypothesise treatment equal standard therapy use oral solution . Babies bear 32 week gestational age routinely supplement oral phosphate soon establish oral feed order prevent bone disorder osteopenia . Babies recruit study give phosphate supplementation per NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde guideline . This single-centre cross-over study take place intensive care special care baby unit Princess Royal Maternity Glasgow . The investigator aim recruit 20-30 baby use blood phosphate level ( obtain routine sample ) evaluate treatment effect . Babies randomise receive either OTFs oral solution potassium acid phosphate 2 week follow 2 week therapy . The investigator hypothesise OTF treatment equivalent standard oral solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There lack 'age-appropriate ' formulation available deliver medicine child . Liquid formulation consider 'gold standard ' delivering medicine child . However , many formulate use ingredient toxic child , particularly neonate ( child &lt; 4 week old ) , possess metabolic process mature organ function adult . For example , many liquid formulation contain preservative benzoic acid improve shelf-life product , include solvent propylene glycol ethanol improve solubility . Many additional , functional ingredient product toxic effect child . For example , neonates unable metabolise benzoic acid , result accumulation ingredient potentially serious neurological respiratory effect know 'gasping syndrome ' . Additionally , lack suitable licensed formulation child lead routine prescribe medicine outside term product license and/or manipulation medicine make suitable child e.g . grind tablet . Further manipulation product increase risk inaccurate dosage administer , add risk error additional calculation require . There also concern compatibility medicine , example , mixed food drink attempt improve acceptability . Looking specifically prescribe within neonatal intensive care , 90 % medicine prescribe unlicensed off-label i.e . use way covered product licence . Therefore , need age-appropriate solid formulation suitable deliver medicine child . By formulate medicine solid dosage form , need excipients preservatives remove . Within last year , rapidly dissolve oral thin film ( OTFs ) develop novel solid dosage platform drug delivery . They first establish breath freshener since progress towards delivery active pharmaceutical ingredient ( APIs ) . Approximately size postage stamp , OTFs dissolve quickly saliva , release drug ( ) without need chew water . They ideally suit patient find difficult swallow oral dosage form tablet capsule . Paediatric elderly patient particularly suit dosage design . Flavourings sweetener include film mask bitter taste medicine necessary . The films discreet , easy use convenient . They history use oral hygiene product medical device . Recent development see use over-the-counter cough cold remedy anti-allergy product . In 2010 , Zuplenz® become first FDA approve prescription medicine OTF formulation delivery ondansetron treatment chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit . Most recently February 2012 , Applied Pharma Research ( APR ) successful marketing prescription zolmitriptan base OTF product treatment migraine . A basic thin film formulation contain ingredient since present solid dosage form , require addition preservative . In USA , Novartis already market several thin film product brand Triaminic® aim child young four treatment cough , cold , allergy . In order investigate whether OTFs safe alternative drug delivery neonate , OTF contain potassium acid phosphate ( KAP ) formulate . KAP chosen study since non-toxic mineral supplement routinely give preterm infant improve bone health . The majority fetal uptake calcium phosphorus occur third trim pregnancy preterm infant bear reduce body store mineral . Hypophosphataemia ( low blood phosphorus ) result increase level calcitriol , active form vitamin D , subsequent demineralisation bone ( osteopenia ) . The association low birth weight , hypercalcaemia ( high blood calcium ) hypophosphataemia first identify early 1980s . It identify active demineralisation bone occur order maintain blood level phosphate require cellular function tissue growth . Reduced bone mineral density metabolic bone disease low birth weight premature infant lead complication fracture reduce growth . Preterm infant milk formula human breast milk fortifiers supplement phosphate , addition within NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde routine clinical practice provide preterm infant born 32 week ' gestational age oral phosphate supplement .</detailed_description>
