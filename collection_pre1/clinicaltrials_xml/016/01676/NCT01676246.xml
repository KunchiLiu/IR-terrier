	<brief_summary>Flupirtine metabolize in-vitro via carbamate cleavage N acetylation glucuronides mercapturic acid derivative . The formation reactive , toxic intermediate product may influence genetic polymorphism involve conjugative metabolic pathway . So purpose study measure pharmacokinetics , metabolism analgesic effect flupirtine dependence function NAT2 , UGT1A1 GSTP1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Flupirtine centrally act analgesic drug . Its mechanism action differs obviously opiates flupirtine antagonizes morphine-induced tail phenomenon mouse relatively low dos . The drug exert relevant anesthetic activity slight inhibitory effect prostaglandin formation animal . As major action mechanism , activation descend noradrenergic neuronal pathway discuss , thereby inhibit afferent nociceptive stimulus spinal , subcortical cortical brain area . Recently show , flupirtine exhibit functional NMDA receptor antagonistic property selective open neuronal potassium channel . The anticonvulsant drug retigabine , chemical structure slightly differs flupirtine ( aromatic ring instead pyrimidine ring ) , subject intensive glucuronidation N-acetylation man . In-vitro , retigabine substrate recombinant uridine glucoronosyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A1 , 1A3 , 1A4 1A9 . Disposition retigabine , however , influence frequent UGT1A1*28 polymorphism ( Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome ) whereas polymorphism N-acetyltransferase 2 ( NAT2 ) result significant change retigabine disposition . Similar retigabine , carbamate group flupirtine hydrolyze carboxyl esterases . The decarbamylated product undergoes N-acetylation form major metabolite D13223 . This acetylation catalyze in-vitro recombinant human NAT2 NAT1 . Furthermore , relatively stable quinone diimines flupirtine D13223 catalyze peroxidase detectable in-vitro experiment . After repeat oral administration flupirtine man , quinone diimines glutathione adduct form mercapturic acid conjugate detect . Therefore , hypothesize , highly reactive diimine radical may appear intermediate detoxified conjugation glutathione via glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) . Diimine intermediate know high cell toxicity , genotoxicity carcinogenicity show intermediate acetaminophen . By analogy acetaminophen , GSTP1 might isoform involve also detoxification flupirtine intermediate . According hypothesis , net appearance toxic intermediate diimine structure hepatocytes dependent activity NAT1/NAT2 , UGTs GSTP1 . Because NAT2 , UGT1A1 GSTP1 highly polymorphic enzyme , risk flupirtine hepatotoxicity may dependent genotype subject treat drug . Our clinical study initiate confirm , whether polymorphisms NAT2 , UGT1A1 GSTP1 may significantly influence disposition analgesic effect flupirtine whether genetic background risk appearance toxic intermediate stable terminal conjugate .</detailed_description>
