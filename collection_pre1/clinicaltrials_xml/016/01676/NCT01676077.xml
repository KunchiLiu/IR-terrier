	<brief_summary>The `` Clinical Outcome Study Dysferlinopathy '' perform centre Europe ( UK- Newcastle ; Spain- Barcelona , Sevilla ; Germany- Berlin , Munich ; Italy- Padova ; France- Paris , Marseille ) , USA ( Charlotte , NC ; Columbus , OH ; Washington , DC ; St.Louis , MO , Stanford CA ) , Japan ( Tokyo ) Australia ( Sydney ) . Oversight funding study provide Jain Foundation , non-profit foundation dedicate find therapy dysferlinopathies ( LGMD2b/Miyoshi ) . The aim `` Clinical Outcome Study '' determine clinical outcome measure require future clinical trial , characterize disease progression dysferlinopathy collect biological sample identification disease marker need non-invasively monitor disease clinical trial . Without information , effective clinical trial perform . This study recruit large number genetically confirm dysferlinopathy patient age 10 year old , ambulant non-ambulant . Participants assess 6 visit 3 year via medical , physiotherapy , MRI/MRS assessment , well standard blood test . Optionally , participant donate blood sample skin sample use identification disease marker approve research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dysferlinopathy represent rare group muscular dystrophy , present particular challenge definition natural history `` trial readiness '' . In early day clone dysferlin gene , several paper describe clinical phenotype time collection patient lead recognition `` core '' phenotype Miyoshi Myopathy ( MM ) , LGMD2B rarer distal myopathy anterior tibial involvement . Most paper deal inbred population limit number mutation represent . Subsequent study report large number patient outbred mutation extend clinical spectrum include onset young early childhood late old age , large group patient clear distinction pattern muscle involvement Miyoshi LGMD possible , involvement proximal distal musculature patient , especially disease progress . A limitation study however exception , mainly inbred group , long-term follow-up data present data clinical progression collect different way make precise comparison conclusion difficult . Nonetheless , study overall agreement dysferlinopathy chronically progressive condition sometimes period plateauing muscle function , variable age wheelchair dependency probably low risk cardiac respiratory complication compare type muscular dystrophy . Intriguing suggestion publication require systematic study include definition particularly good level sport prowess onset symptom description subacute onset muscle pain swelling , feature , good understood , potentially could help understanding pathogenesis disease . Recently , two yet unpublished study address topic chart natural history dysferlinopathy systematically . In study 9 genetically confirm LGMD2B MM patient study 18 month , Isabel Illa colleague find significant decline muscle strength set muscle group measure manual muscle testing , knee flexion measure quantitative muscle testing , accompany detectable deterioration MRI image biceps femori tibialis posterior . Maggie Walter colleague assess natural course disease efficacy deflazacort treatment 25 patient ( 25 63 year age ) genetically confirm dysferlinopathy double-blind , cross-over trial . During first year study , assessed natural course disease 6-month interval , evaluate MRC score , quantitative strength measurement hand-held dynamometry ( Citec , Groningen , Netherlands ) , torque measurement ( M3 diagnose system , Fa . Schnell , Germany ) , Neuromuscular Symptoms Score ( NSS ) , Timed Function Tests ( get lie sit position , climb 4 stair , run 10m ) , Vignos Scale , Hammersmith Motor Ability Score , Global Assessment CGI Scale , quality life SF-36 scale laboratory parameter ( sodium , potassium , creatinine , urea , GOT , GPT , gamma-GT , CK , blood count , ESR , CRP ) . Medication ( placebo deflazacort cross-over design ) start 2nd year study . All patient show decline muscle strength one year , reflect test perform . It reassure data conclude likely change detectable time dysferlinopathy could inform design future clinical trial , optimal measurement yet define map much large group dysferlinopathy patient represent entire clinical spectrum diverse disease group . Extrapolating requirement study type muscular dystrophy , include regulatory advice establish pivotal trial therapy disorder , measure would need include measure muscle strength , also function degree patient report outcomes . The unpublished result Isabel Illa colleague , well another small study MRI dysferlinopathy , also show hope use MRI measure change muscle time might applicable outcome measure . Up , muscle MRI see tool delineate pattern muscle involve monitoring change - use MRI monitoring disease progression non-invasive manner however attract lot current interest , though study need especially respect functional correlate patient relevance . The frequency dysferlinopathy provide challenge collection natural history data . The relative frequency different form muscular dystrophy depend certain extent population study . Dysferlinopathy appear common cause LGMD Southern European population Northern European one . Founder mutation exist small community . There little doubt dysferlinopathy under-diagnosed , fact , clinical diagnostic process dysferlinopathy diagnose also variable . Most laboratory still rely suggestion diagnosis muscle immunocytochemistry ( reliably ) immunoblotting . Some laboratory carry protein test monocyte alternative screen methodology . The gold standard dysferlinopathy diagnosis however become DNA test , sequence carry small number commercial laboratory well series diagnostic laboratory Europe USA . The Jain Foundation ( www.jain-foundation.org ) help guide unsure diagnosis process get genetic analysis . Please contact Sarah Shira Jain Foundation help diagnosis +1 425 882 1492 With perspective different approach therapy dysferlinopathy , clear definition natural history disease delineation suitable outcome measure clinical trial need prioritise . The current protocol build exist national international network bring together critical mass address follow specific aim : 1 . Define natural history dysferlinopathy large unselected patient group respect age nature onset , progression presence complication via exist expanded registry databases 2 . Study selection possible outcome measure dysferlinopathy trial three year period multicentre evaluation 150 patient base centre excellence muscular dystrophy diagnosis management 3 . Extend exist registry activity coordinate Jain Foundation ensure comprehensive patient registry dysferlinopathy , within TREAT-NMD international registry framework .</detailed_description>
