	<brief_summary>This study evaluate technical feasibility use fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) liver tissue obtain vaniprevir ( MK-7009 ) liver pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data , work towards identify minimally invasive , reproducible platform measure liver PK . The study do 2 part . In Part 1 , participant randomize one five FNA/core needle biopsy ( CNB ) time-point collection sequence . In Part 2 , participant randomize one two possible dos vaniprevir assign one five FNA/CNB time-point collection sequence ; participant Part 2 also receive background therapy pegylated interferon alpha-2b ( Peg-IFN alpha-2b ) ribavirin ( RBV ) . The primary hypothesis great 80 % posterior probability vaniprevir concentration successfully obtain least 60 % time FNA liver sample collect 2 3 specified timepoints .</brief_summary>
