	<brief_summary>This pilot study vaccination regime design efficiently induce anti-tumor T-cell response patient WHO grade II glioma . The propose regime BTIC Lysate combination imiquimod , FDA-approved immune response modifier induce potent anti-glioma immune response minimal toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine response rate magnitude CD8+ T-cell responses Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccine post-vaccine PBMC use IFN- ELISPOT . ELISPOT assay indicate functional status antigen-specific T cell cytokine-expression , particularly interested Type-1 ( i.e . IFN express ) T cell response . Therefore , IFN ELISPOT use primary assay immunological endpoint . Using flow-cytometry , also evaluate number lymphocyte subset CD4+ T cell , CD4+/Foxp3+ regulatory T cell exploratory manner . In addition , participant undergo surgical debulking progress tumor , tumor tissue available , infiltration antigen-specific CTLs evaluate flow cytometry tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccine-targeted GAA specific MHC-tetramers . In addition , serological response evaluate flow-cytometry BTIC cell well western blot . These plan ( paragraph ) immunological evaluation ; however , compose primary endpoint due exploratory nature . We determine whether safe administer Imiquimod/BTIC lysate-based vaccine patient grade II glioma . Endpoints therefore include incidence severity adverse event , use standard criterion well close clinical follow-up would perform normally group participant follow vaccination . All report observed toxicity adverse event clinic visit grade , document report accord standard toxicity table , Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0</detailed_description>
