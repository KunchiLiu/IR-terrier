	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare ofatumumab &amp; chlorambucil ( O-Chl ) versus ofatumumab &amp; bendamustine ( O-B ) patient Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia consider fit enough rituximab , fludarabine &amp; cyclophosphamide ( R-FC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Looking Ofatumumab People With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Who Can Have More Intensive Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chlorambucil ( Chl ) mainstay CLL treatment half century . However , frontline treatment improve considerably last decade , first advent fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide ( FC ) , recently addition anti-CD20 antibody , rituximab , FC . Although FC-based regimen considerably effective Chl , also associate great toxicity make inappropriate less fit patient . This important consideration , give CLL predominantly affect old people tend co-morbidity . Although single-arm phase II study ( Roche MO20927 ; NCRI CLL208 ) show R-Chl safe effective , phase III data prove benefit add anti-CD20 antibody Chl . This question currently address phase III RCT Chl without ofatumumab ( GSK OMB110911 / COMPLEMENT-1 / NCRI CLL7 ) . Ofatumumab fully human anti-CD20 antibody bind epitope distinct rituximab produce complement-dependent cytotoxicity . The RIAltO trial direct follow-on NCRI CLL7 phase III RCT trial less fit patient therefore Ofatumumab dose select mirror regimen use trial .</detailed_description>
