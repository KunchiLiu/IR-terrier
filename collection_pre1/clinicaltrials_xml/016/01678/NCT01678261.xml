	<brief_summary>The human genetic material consist 46 chromosome two sex chromosome . The sex-chromosome mother X father Y-chromosome . Hence male consist one Y one X chromosome female 2 X-chromosomes . Alterations number sex-chromosomes particular X-chromosome fundamental development numerous syndrome Turner syndrome ( 45 , X ) , Klinefelter syndrome ( 47 , XXY ) , triple X syndrome ( 47 , XXX ) double Y syndrome ( 47 , XYY ) . Despite obvious association X-chromosome disease one gene show significance , namely short stature homeobox gene ( SHOX ) . Turner syndrome well characterized typical disease affect syndrome : - An Increased risk diseases one 's immune system react one 's body ( autoimmune disease ) cause know ; For example diabetes hypothyroidism . - Increased risk abortion death uteri - Underdeveloped ovary inability produce sex hormone infertile . - Congenital malformation major artery heart unknown origin . - Alterations development brain , especially respect social cognitive dimension . - Increased incidence obesity , hypertension , diabetes osteoporosis . In healthy woman normal X-chromosomes , one X-chromosomes switch ( silence ) . The X-chromosome silenced varies cell cell . The silencing control part X-chromosome designate XIC ( X-inactivation center ) . The inactivation/silencing X-chromosome initiated gene name Xist-gene ( X inactivation specific transcript ) .This gene encodes specific structure call lincRNAs ( long intervening specific transcript ) similar genetic material ( DNA ) cod protein . The final result woman X-chromosome mosaic one X-chromosome mother X father . However , numerous gene X-chromosome escape silence process unknown mechanism . Approximately two third gene silence , 15 % avoid silence 20 percent silence escape depend tissue origin . The aforementioned long non-protein-coding part genetic material ( LincRNAs ) abundant produce large quantity wole respect health disease need clarification . Studies indicate LincRNAs interact protein cod part genetic material modifying gene translate protein . During re-modelling left foot print genetic material indicate modification result silence translation gene . It possible map foot print along entire X-chromosome use molecular technique like ChIP ( Chromatin immunoprecipitation ) ChIP-seq ( deep sequencing ) . The understanding achieve far interplay genetic material disease arise genetic syndrome X-chromosome syndrome relatively frequent show clear manifestation disease give researcher possibility identify genetic material link disease . Turner Klinefelter syndrome , remain sex chromosome syndrome , excellent human disease model help elaborate process contribute development disease like diabetes , hypothyroidism , main artery dilation ischemic heart disease . The purpose study : 1 . Define change non-coding part X-chromosome . 2 . Identify transcriptome ( non-coding part X-chromosome ) respect RNA generate X-chromosome . 3 . Identify change cod non-coding part X-chromosome specific relation Turner syndrome explain disease see Turner syndrome . 4 . Study tissue affect disease order look change X-chromosome respect cod non-coding part chromosome . 6 . Determine certain gene escape X-chromosome silence establish associate parent origin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The X chromosome cornerstone pathogenesis number syndrome , whereof Turner syndrome ( 45 , X ) , Klinefelter syndrome ( 47 , XXY ) , triple X syndrome ( 47 , XXX ) double Y syndrome ( 47 , XYY ) . Despite importance clinical disease , one gene X chromosome far implicated wide spectrum phenotypic trait see X-related syndrome . The one know gene SHOX ( short stature homeobox ) gene encodes transcription factor brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) fibroblast growth factor receptor gene ( FGFR3 ) transcriptional target . It locate pseudoautosomal region X Y chromosome . This gene show involve short stature Turner syndrome , Leri-Weill syndrome idiopathic short stature . It also cause increased stature Klinefelter syndrome , triple X syndrome XYY syndrome . A number traits disease see frequently X-chromosomal syndrome explain SHOX gene . The best characterized syndrome Turner syndrome , phenotype trait divide : 1 . Autoimmune predilection , lead increase risk virtually autoimmune disease unknown pathogenesis diabetes hypothyroidism . 2 . Decreased intrauterine viability . Here haploinsufficiency X-linked pseudoautosomal gene operate placenta suggest involve ( STS CSF2RA ) . 3 . Ovarian dysgenesis , lead ovarian insufficiency need long term sex hormone replacement therapy . 4 . Congenital cardiovascular malformation unresolved pathogeneses . 5 . Brain development , especially social-cognitive development , alter many case , often `` male-like '' direction . 6 . Increased prevalence metabolic syndrome osteoporosis . In healthy woman 's cell , two X-chromosomes , random X inactivation take place ( 13 ) . The process govern X inactivation center ( XIC ) initiate Xist gene encode long intervene non-coding RNA ( lincRNA ) . The Xist gene locate close centromere long arm X chromosome , orchestrate repressive histone modification ( recruit PRC2 ) along X chromosome lead inactivation . In remain active X chromosome PRC2 titrate away Tsix , effectively leave female mosaic X chromosome one maternal one paternal origin . However , great number gene spread X chromosome escape X-inactivation unknown mechanism dosage compensation take place , expression male female comparable many gene ( 15 , 16 ) . Approximately 65 % gene fully silence , 15 % completely escape X-inactivation , 20 % show variable expression , depend tissue cell origin ( 17 ) . LincRNAs pervasively transcribe genome , although role health disease poorly understood . Studies dosage compensation , imprint homeotic gene expression suggest lincRNAs function interface DNA chromatin remodel involvement reprogramming chromatin promote cancer metastasis . To date range different interaction hypothesize lincRNAs transcriptional regulation , may function intact interact molecule well Dicer process molecule chop small interfering RNAs degrade RNAs . Chromatin remodel analyze mark leave histone DNA strand , either permissive repressive nature , depend acetylation methylation take place histone . As example , trimethylation lysine 4 histone H3 ( H3K4me3 ) enrich transcriptionally active gene promoter , whereas trimethylation H3K9 ( H3Kme3 ) H3K27 ( H3K27me3 ) present gene promoter transcriptionally repress . By use chromatin immunoprecipitation couple deep sequencing ( chIPseq ) one obtain mark along whole X chromosome one assay . The epigenetic alteration histone modification study new methodology , enable use relatively old pathological specimen . This open new prospect expansion knowledge role X-chromosomal permission inactivation different disease , X-chromosomal syndrome may serve initial model understand process highly likely important disease ( e.g . diabetes hypothyroidism ) beyond syndrome . As another example , congenital malformation heart frequent Turner syndrome often lead early aortic dilatation dissection . In patient control , collect paraffin- embed block tissue aortic wall , assess use frontline methodology potential identify novel mark Turner patient DNA compare DNA non-Turner patient . Imprinting another important aspect sex chromosome action . Imprinting refers process gene ( gene ) may imprint depend parental origin . Put another way , gene `` turn '' depend maternal paternal origin . Furthermore , mouse study show cluster gene X chromosome imprint independent X chromosome inactivation . The importance biological inheritance apparent major cardiovascular morbidity affect population , hereditary trait clearly prevail certain family . Despite promise target prevention treatment cardiovascular morbidity , specific part genome potentially trigger pathology largely remain defined , could bring important knowledge pathophysiology . The major body knowledge implication genome aberration originate disease obvious severe manifestation result clear mode transmission allow identification causative region genome . Such genetic disorder hold potential understanding role specific locus genome , identify , large chromosomal region often involve . In case X- chromosomal phenotype expect causative agent X chromosome , use various novel technology identify agent . Currently , limit knowledge importance X-chromosome cardiovascular pathology come single-gene disorder , non-specific gender difference addition sex chromosomal anomaly . In contrast , single-gene disorder Y- chromosome establish related cardiovascular morbidity . Appropriate human model improve understanding role play sex chromosome available . Here , deviation normality occur reasonable prevalence also associate readily identifiable phenotype adverse prognosis . Turner Klinefelter syndromes constitute model ; female reduction X- chromosomal material male increase X-chromosomal material , respectively . These anomaly sex-chromosomes associate excess morbidity mortality congenital acquire cardiovascular well diabetes , ovarian insufficiency disease . The cardiovascular phenotype expression activation gene investigate healthy female male comparison Turner Klinefelter syndromes cross-sectional descriptive design . These study already perform precise characterization establish . The hypothesis significance X-chromosome manifest alter level expression activation association different cardiovascular phenotype . Secondarily , basic analogous knowledge provide Y-chromosome . The project expect generate hypothesis role play genome morbidity population normal karyotype well abnormal karyotype . In project provide unique combination front line molecular technology well define patient cohort . The hypothesis test follow : 1 . Non-coding transcript X chromosome play fundamental role sex chromosome abnormality , may work regulation epigenetic mechanism mRNA destabilization 2 . The regulation non-coding RNA expression X-chromosomes base epigenetic mechanism lead different histone mark , different DNA methylation e.g. , Turner Klinefelter syndrome person compare healthy gender-matched control . 3 . The gene expression pattern result mechanisms different sex chromosome abnormality comparison healthy male female , difference study diseased tissue Turner syndrome woman compare normal control tissue . 4 . It may possible identify one driver molecule diseased tissue Turner Klinefelter syndrome person , validate vitro vivo may explain disease process , give important pathophysiological information . Expected finding . We expect able define epigenetic change X-chromosomes single base resolution , thus identify CpG methylation DNA strand well permissive repressive histone mark histone . We expect identify transcriptome regard mRNA non-coding RNAs ( long well microRNAs ) RNAs generate X-chromosome . We expect able provide Atlas epigenetic event specific Turner syndrome effect transcriptome . Using bioinformatic method hopefully lead identification novel dysregulated molecule may explain various property patient . These molecule subject validation separate patient cohort use PCR IHC technology . In diseased tissue study tissue specific alteration epigenome transcriptome X chromosome compare normal tissue control sample . We hope lead identification driver disease process pathophysiological understand disease process .</detailed_description>
