	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetically Based Dosing Thiopurines Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The thiopurines 6-mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) 6-thioguanine ( 6TG ) widely use treatment childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . They primarily exert cytotoxicity conversion 6-thioguanine nucleotide ( 6TGN ) incorporate DNA . Interindividual variation response thiopurine therapy influence genetically determine polymorphisms activity enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) . TPMT compete formation 6TGN , methylates thiopurines ( especially 6MP ) metabolite . Approximately ten percent individual TPMT heterozygous , one wild type one low activity allele , one three hundred individual TPMT deficient two low activity allele . During maintenance therapy phase treatment childhood ALL , may last several year , 6MP give daily basis start dose 75 mg/m.sq./day , subsequently adjust white blood cell count 1.5-3.5 x109/L . We previously demonstrate risk relapse reduce 50 % , risk second cancer increase 3-fold among TPMT low activity patient . Accordingly , Nordic ALL2000 protocol recommend dose 6MP base patient TPMT activity . In present study almost 1000 Nordic patient , explore whether strategy TPMT-based individualised 6MP dosing benefit patient reduce risk second cancer preserve low risk relapse .</detailed_description>
