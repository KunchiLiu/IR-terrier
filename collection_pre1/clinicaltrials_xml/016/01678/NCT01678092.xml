	<brief_title>Single Center Study Using Omalizumab Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase I randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study Omalizumab subject severe atopic dermatitis food allergy . Subjects participate 2 year . The treatment period 24 week period subject receive Omalizumab either every 2 4 week subcutaneously ( per product insert guideline ) . Subjects randomize placebo group receive sterile water every 2 4 week subcutaneously . Previous medication standardize equivalent dos one month prior first dose . The monthly laboratory assessment subject include complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum chemistry ( Chem7/AST/ALT ) , IgE level . Safety : Adverse event clinical status actively monitor study visit week 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 ( 3 month last study dose ) well review daily diary per NIH assessment guideline . Assessments platelet count ( CBC ) , liver function ( LFTs ) , serum chemistry panel , serum IgE make monthly basis treatment period ( 24 week ) . Serum pregnancy test perform screen part inclusion/exclusion criterion . Efficacy : Efficacy parameter include standardized SCORAD classification system , Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) score subject/care giver global assessment subject 24 week compare baseline . An assessment food allergy make skin prick test RAST perform baseline last dose . Diaries also take ass use concomitant medication food allergy symptom . In addition , one secondary endpoint assess durability effect Xolair treatment discontinue . This achieve follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month last treatment dose . The investigator also assess use concomitant medication food allergy via daily diary assessment . Number subject plan : 20 ( Omalizumab 10 Placebo 10 ) . Number subject analyse : ( Omalizumab 4 Placebo 4 ) . Male female age 4-25 year . Diagnosis severe atopic dermatitis ( meet SCORAD criterion ) least 6 month document symptom . Also concomitant food allergy determine positive skin prick test . Omalizumab supply sterile , white , preservative-free , lyophilized powder contain single-use vial reconstitute Sterile Water Injection ( SWFI ) , USP , administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . A Xolair vial contains 202.5 mg Omalizumab , 145.5 mg sucrose , 2.8 mg L-histidine hydrochloride mono hydrate , 1.8 mg L-histidine 0.5 mg polysorbate 20 design deliver 150 mg Omalizumab , 1.2 mL reconstitution 1.4 mL SWFI , USP . Treatment dose determine outlined product insert . 2 year study duration ( 24 Weeks treatment ) . The reference placebo ( sterile water ) give subcutaneously . The primary efficacy variable improvement SCORAD , Physician 's Global Assessment , Subject/Caregiver Global Assessment score subject 24 week compare baseline .</detailed_description>
