	<brief_summary>Background Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) define defect glucose tolerance onset first recognition pregnancy usually disappear , least temporarily , delivery . Its prevalence generally range 3 6 % , may reach 12 15 % high-risk population specific ethnic group . GDM increase risk potentially severe maternal , fetal neonatal complication ( gestational hypertension , pre-eclampsia , caesarean delivery ; macrosomia ; shoulder dystocia ) . These risk linearly correlate level maternal hyperglycaemia . GDM due failure pancreatic beta cell sustain compensatory insulin secretion insulin resistance physiological pregnancy much pronounce woman , especially case overweight obesity . Maternal obesity major risk factor GDM . Yet , micronutrient deficiency frequently report obese patient . Some nutritional deficiency , concern particularly lipophilic micronutrient ( vitamin A , vitamin D , vitamin E , carotenoid ) may associate disease link insulin resistance . Numerous study show inverse relationship plasma concentration and/or dietary intake micronutrient incidence type 2 diabetes . Vitamin D deficiency could involve pathogenesis type 2 diabetes alteration insulin secretion sensitivity . Deficiencies vitamin A , vitamin E carotenoid ( particular lycopene beta carotene ) increase oxidative stress pro-inflammatory status , could thus imply physiopathology insulin resistance glucose intolerance . Some case-control study find inverse correlation plasma concentration vitamin D pregnancy incidence GDM , independently age , ethnic origin body mass index . Data scarce vitamin A vitamin E , lack carotenoid . Besides , available study mainly descriptive one , without clear explanation underlie mechanism . The favourable effect micronutrient insulin sensitivity could partially mediate adipokines and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine secrete level adipose tissue . Numerous study show woman develop GDM pregnancy present significant decrease circulate rate adiponectin , ( adipokine anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitizing property ) significant increase secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine imply physiopathology insulin resistance . In laboratory ( INRA unit 1260 ) , show experimental work conduct vitro human adipocytes vivo mouse vitamin E could induce transcription secretion adiponectin ; also show vitamin D lycopene could modulate inflammatory reaction adipose tissue , involve physiopathology insulin resistance . Aims method We hypothesise , pregnant woman , link plasma concentration dietary intake lipophilic micronutrient ( mainly vitamins A , D , E carotenoid ) , secretion adipokines pro-inflammatory cytokine , risk develop GDM ; also hypothesise relationship independent age , body mass index , ethnic origin main risk factor GDM . To test hypothesis , aim lead transversal monocentric study , within population 500 pregnant woman submit systematic screening GDM oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) HÃ´pital Nord Marseilles . The main criterion evaluation link lipophilic micronutrient GDM nutritional score calculate follow : micronutrient ( vitamin A , D , E , lycopene , beta carotene , alpha carotene , lutein ) , attribute 0 point patient situate low quartile , 1 2 point follow quartile , 3 point high quartile . At end , patient thus score 0 21 reflect global status micronutrient . The main secondary objective define relationship plasma concentration dietary intake micronutrient 1/the value glycemia insulinemia OGTT 2/the degree insulin sensitivity estimate measure HOMA index , 3/the circulate rate adipokines ( mainly adiponectin , leptin , chemerin ) pro-inflammatory cytokine ( TNF alpha , IL-1 , IL-6 ) , 4/the child 's birth weight .</brief_summary>
