	<brief_summary>Stroke main cause motor disability among adult expect impose increase social economic burden Country . The impact stroke patient enormous , negative ramification person participation social , vocational , recreational activity . It primary cause long-term disability country . At present stage , well know control balance upright stand depend upon central integration afferent information vestibular , somatosensory ( proprioceptive , tactile ) , visual system , constitute multilink neural network control neck , hip , ankle joint . More recently , study level cerebral cortex ; vestibular input would reach face/neck representation primary somatosensory cortex would integrate visual somatosensory input intraparietal , posterior end insula medial superior temporal cortex . Remarkably , balance impairment associate risk fall represent one prominent potentially disable feature stroke subject . The specific aim project : verify whether robotics low limb treatment body weight support effective treadmill treatment reduction motor impairment Stroke patient , improve quality gait endurance analyze possible improvement term physiological biomechanical gait analysis spatio-temporal parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : ass lower limb recovery gait rehabilitation training exercise acute chronic stroke patient . The propose project , Randomized control observer-blind trial aim evaluate effectiveness end-effector robot assist therapy v treadmill ground treatment sub-acute chronic stroke subject . 90 inpatient out-patients stroke recruit . We randomize patient 3 group [ 15 sub-acute ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) stroke patient ( 30Â±7 day injury ) 15 chronic ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) patient ( 3/6 month day injury ) group ] : 1. sub-acute chronic stroke patient robot treatment . 2. sub-acute chronic patient treadmill treatment . 3. sub-acute chronic patient ground treatment . The specific aim project : 1. verify whether robotics end-effector GEO low limb treatment body weight support effective treadmill treatment ground treatment reduction motor impairment sub-acute Chronic stroke patient , improve quality gait endurance ; 2. analyse possible improvement term physiological biomechanical gait analysis kinematics , kinetics EMG evaluation ; 3. analyse possible improvement term reduction instable posture movement , represent reduction risk fall typical subject ; 4. evaluate kinematic , kinetic EMG quantitative data select movement ( gait , posture , ) compare age match reference data ; 5. investigate stability effect robot-assisted treatment 4/6 month follow-up term Quality Life ( QoL ) . A first goal project investigate difference improvement quality safety gait ( motor performance functional recovery ) kinematic/kinetic EMG parameter ( Change Step Length , Change Gait Velocity Change Stride Time Variability , 3D joint kinematics , ground reaction force , joint kinetics , muscle activation , ) traditional clinical scale sub-acute chronic stroke patient . The second goal aim identify possible advantage QoL patient undergoing kind in-patients out-patients rehabilitation treatment investigate novel method enable low limb functional recovery , lead wide potential regain personal independence . The third goal analyse direct cost saving associate use technology , measure direct , indirect intangible cost , specific HTA procedure .</detailed_description>
