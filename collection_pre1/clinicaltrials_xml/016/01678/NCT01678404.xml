	<brief_summary>Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma ( MZL ) lymphoma originate B-cell lymph node variable differentiation status , distribute variety organ . A high response rate long term survival possible surgery radiation therapy alone case limited disease . However frequent relapse progression observe despite long term survival . The treatment relapse establish yet . So investigate efficacy radioimmunotherapy use 131I-rituximab refractory relapse patient MZL .</brief_summary>
