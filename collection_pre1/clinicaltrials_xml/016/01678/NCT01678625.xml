	<brief_summary>Residual neuromuscular blockade ( weakness ) common occurrence postanesthesia care unit muscle relaxant drug use operating room . The method reliably detect presence neuromuscular blockade use quantitative neuromuscular monitor . These device measure quantify degree muscle weakness display result screen . When use train-of-four ( TOF ) nerve stimulation , ratio fourth muscle contraction ( twitch ) first twitch displayed ; ratio 90 % ( 0.9 ) great , full recovery muscle strength present , endotracheal tube remove . At present time , one commercially-available quantitative monitor available United States -the TOF-Watch . It use many clinician require experience obtain accurate result , expensive , subject interference factor operate room . The aim investigation examine new quantitative monitor ( T4-EMG ( EMG = electromyography ) may subject limitation TOF-Watch AMG ( AMG = acceleromyography ) . In order study accuracy new device , T4-EMG compare current `` clinical gold standard '' , TOF-Watch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim investigation examine new prototype quantitative monitoring instrument meet requirement . Patients undergo surgery general anesthesia monitor new EMG device ( T4-EMG ) induction anesthesia recovery neuromuscular blockade . Continuous data record onto interfaced computer T4-EMG monitor time period . At time , continuous neuromuscular data record onto computer AMG device ( TOF-Watch , `` establish standard '' clinical use ) attach arm . The applicability ( ease use , equipment need , etc . ) , repeatability ( precision internal consistency ) , performance ( agreement establish standard , bias ) T4-EMG compare AMG determine onset recovery neuromuscular blockade . 44 patient present elective surgical procedure expect duration great 60 minute enrol study . ASA I III patient require neuromuscular blockade operating room eligible enrollment . Anesthetic management standardize . Upon arrival operating room , neuromuscular monitoring surface electrode apply . All monitoring conduct patient general anesthesia surgical procedure . Surface electrodes ( non-invasive EKG electrode ) place cleansed skin ulnar nerve available arm near wrist . The electrode connect lead peripheral nerve stimulator ( TOF-Watch ) . When nerve stimulator activate , response stimulation measure simultaneously AMG ( TOF-Watch-acceleration contraction adductor pollicis-thumb ) EMG ( T4-EMG-electrical activity adductor pollicis-thumb ) device . Therefore , TOF-Watch serve nerve stimulator study group . The transducer AMG device place thumb corresponding hand . A 75-150g preload ( via Hand adapter ) apply per standard recommendation . After induction anesthesia , administration rocuronium , calibration , supramaximal stimulation , stable baseline achieve TOF-Watch suggest GCRP guideline . The T4-EMG place arm AMG device , sense electrode attach surface thenar eminence ( base thumb ) . A second sensing lead , use detect delivery electrical stimulating pulse , place stimulate lead AMG device . This sense lead use trigger data acquisition T4-EMG , direct connection patient , electrical feedback connection alters function AMG . After satisfactory level stimulation response obtain TOF-Watch , T4-EMG device turn , impedance thenar sense lead measure . The trigger sense engage , baseline stimulus deliver via AMG ( TOF-Watch ) . Data simultaneously collect thenar sense lead inspect T4-EMG display , fine adjustment electrode position stimulus intensity may make optimize evoked myoelectric response patient . At conclusion setup procedure , setting AMG T4-EMG hold constant remainder surgery . After baseline data collect ( average time 5 minute ) , neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) administer . Data relating onset ( TOF ratio decrease 1.0 0.3 less AMG device display ) , maintenance ( TOF ratio less 0.3 constant AMG device display ) , reversal ( increase TOF ratio 0.1 0.9 ) record . Monitoring continue full recovery neuromuscular function note ( TOF ratio least 0.9 great AMG device display ) . At time , anesthesia agent turn patient awakened extubated . Patients ' trachea may extubated achieve TOF ratio 0.9 awaken time , per usual clinical routine determine clinician . For first 34 patient , TOF-Watch use nerve stimulator AMG ( TOF-Watch ) EMG ( T4-EMG ) group . The ability T4-EMG device sense/measure TOF ratio primary aim study ( comparison `` clinical gold standard '' TOF-Watch ) . However , prototype T4-EMG ( well commercial device develop ) also contain nerve stimulator ( qualitative quantitative monitor ) . On subset patient monitor TOF-Watch ( 10 patient ) , stand-alone T4-EMG device ( single unit contain nerve stimulator sensing/monitoring component ) connect arm operate independently TOF-Watch . Its stimulate electrode place surface arm adjacent TOF-Watch electrode ; sense lead place thenar eminence protocol describe . The T4-EMG set independently TOF-Watch , stimulator adjustment make accord protocol TOF-Watch adjustment . The T4-EMG operate stimulate record time select anesthesiologist conflict operation TOF-Watch interfere patient care activity . Evoked muscle response data display T4-EMG , amplitude ratio compute used direct patient care . The purpose demonstrate device elicits record evoke muscle response surgical patient assess usability : contrast main protocol T4-EMG trigger TOF-Watch comparison record response goal . The primary endpoint first 33 patient analysis agreement AMG ( clinical `` gold standard '' ) EMG device neuromuscular recovery . Data compare two device AMG-derived TOF ratio value 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 ( achieve ) recovery neuromuscular function . Bias limit agreement calculate TOF value .</detailed_description>
