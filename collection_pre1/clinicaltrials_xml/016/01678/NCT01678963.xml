	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Squalamine Lactate Eye Drops Subjects With Neovascular ( Wet ) Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) degenerative retinal eye disease cause progressive loss central vision . AMD lead cause legal blindness among adult age 50 old Western world affect 25-30 million people globally . This number expect triple next 25 year . Central vision loss AMD cause degeneration light-sensing cell macula call photoreceptors . The macula , central portion retina , responsible perceive fine visual detail . As photoreceptors begin degenerate , individual 's central vision . The extent vision loss varies widely relate type AMD , severity individual characteristic . AMD present two different form — `` dry '' form severe `` wet '' form . Dry AMD , common milder form AMD , account 85 % 90 % case . It result vary form sight loss may may eventually develop wet form . Although wet form AMD account 10 % 15 % AMD , chance severe sight loss much great . Wet AMD responsible 90 % severe vision loss associate AMD . Approximately 500,000 new case wet AMD diagnose annually worldwide . In North America alone , approximately 200,000 new case wet AMD diagnose year . Squalamine lactate find inhibitor new blood vessel formation ( angiogenesis ) induce VEGF , PDGF bFGF . Since angiogenesis implicate growth maintenance choroidal neovascularization , squalamine lactate potentially attractive development candidate treatment age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , blood vessel proliferation role .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>≥50 year age , male female Have follow criterion study eye : A diagnosis choroidal neovascularization secondary AMD total lesion area ≤ 12 disc area CNV affect least 50 % total lesion area , least one eye confirm fluorescein angiography ( via reading center ) Central Retinal Thickness ( SD OCT central 1 mm ) ≥ 300 um Presence subretinal fluid cystoid edema OCT. Pigment epithelial detachment without subretinal fluid cystoid edema exclude BCVA 20/40 20/230 ( 25 70 letter ETDRS ) If eye qualify eye great CRT study eye . If equal right eye select study eye . Female subject must 1year postmenopausal surgically sterilize , Women childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test must use acceptable method contraception throughout study . Be willing able provide sign informed consent prior participation studyrelated procedure . Neovascularization secondary condition AMD study eye . Blood occupy great 50 % AMD lesion . Blood underlying fovea . Prior treatment study eye bevacizumab , ranibizumab , aflibercept , PDT , submacular surgery , antiangiogenic drug . Confounding ocular condition study eye affect interpretation OCT , VA assessment macular appearance eg : cataract . Subjects VA bad 20/200 ( less 34 letter ) fellow ( nonstudy ) eye . Fibrosis atrophy , retinal epithelial tear center fovea study eye condition prevent VA improvement . Prior ocular surgery study eye ( Vitrectomy , scleral buckle , glaucoma filter/shunt ) . Cataract surgery 3 month prior enrollment allow long posterior chamber intraocular lens place . Wearing contact lens . Concomitant therapy drug may affect VA , med may toxic lens/retina optic nerve . Current ocular periocular infection study eye . Hypersensitivity Lucentis . Hypersensitivity squalamine component ophthalmic formulation Presence life threaten disease currently treatment malignancy . Currently chemotherapy . Currently systemic steroid . Pregnant lactating . Investigational product use kind previous 30 day . Subjects attendance monthly examination may unreliable eg : dependent elderly caregiver . Glaucoma study eye ( glaucomatous visual field defect receive treatment ) . Myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within past 6 month . Clinical evidence diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema study eye . Uncontrolled hypertension ( Diastolic BP &gt; 105 mmHg ) spite antihypertensive medication . Subjects know HIV . A history drug alcohol abuse . Subjects unable administer eye drop reliably .</criteria>
