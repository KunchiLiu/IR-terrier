	<brief_title>EUS-Guided Rendezvous Direct Interventions Versus Advanced ERCP Techniques Biliary Access Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Biliary tract obstruction stone strictures usually treat use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) technique . However , biliary access ( cannulation ) ERCP difficult . Overall cannulation success 90-95 % expert , center . Difficult cannulation associate increased complication rate , prolong repeat attempt cause injury ampulla . When standard biliary cannulation fails advance cannulation technique , precut access sphincterotomy , often indicate . These advanced technique , however , increase complication rate ERCP , still fail certain percentage case . Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary intervention relatively newer technique emerge useful option achieve biliary access therapy standard advance ERCP technique biliary access fail . Many center , include , currently use EUS-guided intervention facilitate ERCP access therapy , need . EUS-guided intervention emerge safe effective procedure gain access biliary tree . A recent retrospective study compare safety efficacy EUS rendezvous precut sphincterotomy ( advanced ERCP technique access ) , find EUS-rendezvous significantly successful significant difference rate procedural complication . Currently , accept standard decide biliary access technique use case difficult biliary cannulation . We hypothesize EUS-guided biliary intervention successful may associate ( less ) complication use advanced ERCP technique case difficult bile duct access . Procedures : Patients refer ERCP biliary intervention participate center approach consent . Patients agree participate undergo standard ERCP . The attend endoscopist use standard ERCP technique ( i.e . cannulation standard cannula sphincterotome without wire ) gain biliary access minimum ten minute . If biliary access fails , patient randomize either EUS-guided intervention arm advance cannulation technique arm study . The randomization ratio 50-50 . Methods Data Analysis : Based current available data well experience , estimate success immediate biliary access EUS-guided intervention 90 % , advanced ERCP cannulation technique 75 % . To detect difference power 0.8 p-value &lt; 0.05 , sample size approximately 230 patient need . Assuming 10 % patient consent randomize ( base rationale 90 % patient either successfully cannulate within 10 excluded reason ) estimate approximately 2,300 patient consent study . As first study kind possible achieve statistical significance enrollment number earlier anticipated number 230 participant two interim analysis plan study . The first interim analysis schedule occur enrollment 70 patient ( 35 arm ) second enrollment 140 patient ( 70 arm ) . The block randomization result equal number patient arm enrollment level . Adjustment significance level interim analysis calculate use Pocock Boundary method ( 9 ) . For either interim analysis , level significance require termination trial efficacy p = 0.0221 . An independent statistician review result make recommendation regard study termination base result interim analysis .</detailed_description>
