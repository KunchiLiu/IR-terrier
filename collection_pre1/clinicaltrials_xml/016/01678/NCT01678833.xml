	<brief_summary>Background : Although treatment substance abuse consider effective people drug dependent , many others benefit much time . Researchers work find characteristics predict treatment response . They also want determine design treatment effective great number substance abuser . This pilot study involve provide drug addict cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , treatment consider one effective reduce substance-abuse , identify way brain work may predict explain treatment effect . A comparison group include receive standard psychotherapy talk therapy . This approach enable researcher determine factor might interfere favorable treatment outcome refine develop new treatment work well people . Objectives : - To identify individual characteristic predict explain effect CBT people opiate dependence . Eligibility : - Males 18 60 year age dependent opioids ( heroin ) . - Participants must willing take buprenorphine receive substance abuse counseling . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Researchers ask question participant ability cope certain situation , along question drug use lifestyle issue . These question ask twice , complete treatment . - Participants place one two group . One group CBT twice week 8 week . The group standard counsel twice per week . Both group take buprenorphine part drug abuse treatment . - Participants test study . They image study look brain function . These study test think decision making .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The primary objective pilot study collect data NIH RO1 grant submission aim elucidate cognitive , emotional regulatory neurobiological mechanism moderate mediate effect cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) individual opiate dependence . CBT proven moderately effective treat substance abuse ; however , significant variability treatment outcomes remain . CBT curriculum teach adaptive decision make cognitive reappraisal skills down-regulate emotional response drug-related cue , thereby promote avoidance drug use situation . A certain level cognitive emotion regulatory functioning , however , require assimilate execute skill often deficient substance abuser . Consequently , many addict effectively process act CBT curriculum , lead poor treatment outcome . Tailoring intervention require systematic investigation neurobiological indicator interfere promote favorable treatment responsivity . The small pilot study outline provide feasibility supportive data large effort . Aim 1 : Moderation . Identify baseline ECF emotion regulatory function neural substrate predict treatment variability form : ( ) program responsivity ( e.g. , treatment engagement , motivation , social competence ) ( b ) posttreatment outcome ( e.g. , substance use frequency , day continuous abstinence ) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use performance task measure ECF ( decision-making ; inhibitory control ) cognitive reappraisal emotional cue investigate neuromodulatory role PFC region ( e.g. , OFC , ACC ) emotion ( e.g. , amygdala ) reward ( e.g. , ventral striatum ) structure autonomic activity . Aim 2 : Mediation . Determine whether change neurocognitive function response CBT mediate intervention effect . Evidence suggest CBT alters PFC limbic function ; change associate clinical outcome depression anxiety . Similarly , drug abuser , predict treatment response associate change neural activation pattern , ECF , emotional regulation , little change occur relatively poor outcome . Study Population : Participants 18 primary opioid dependent individual age 18 60 . These individual either enrol NIDA Protocol 09-DA-N020 , ( Dr. Kenzie Preston , PI ) patient University Maryland Medical Center outpatient substance abuse clinic ( i.e. , Alcohol Drug Abuse Program ( ADAP ) Outpatient Addiction Treatment Service ( OATS ) receive buprenorphine . DESIGN : Study participant visit treatment facility daily buprenorphine receive standard counsel part Protocol 09-DA-N020 treatment protocol ADAP OATS . They screen MMG eligibility present study randomly assign TAU control group CBT group . This study consist 3 assessment time point ( baseline , midway , post-treatment ) 16 bi-weekly counseling visit ( CBT standard TAU counsel ) . Baseline assessment consist functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) performance decision making , inhibitory control emotional regulatory task . Questionnaires use evaluate historical current drug use , background psychological trait , relevant factor . Those TAU group visit treatment facility routinely buprenorphine standard counsel receive CBT . The CBT group participant undergo 8 week CBT Archway Clinic twice week provide CBT clinician Mountain Manor Treatment Center supervise Dr. Marc Fishman , treatment director MMTC ; CBT counsel place TAU counseling would receive part parent protocol . Midway CBT/TAU counseling , participant pilot study evaluate outside scanner cognitive task use scanner questionnaire baseline . After treatment completion , receive post-treatment fMRI scan perform task questionnaire . Also , preliminarily assess mediation examine variability level responsivity within treatment group determine whether outcome relate functional baseline characteristic change time . Expectations baseline feature predict intervention response characteristic change time response intervention favorable outcome . OUTCOME MEASURES : The focus outcome evaluation use opioid ( e.g. , frequency , day continuous abstinence , etc . ) , cop strategy , change lifestyle measure ( e.g. , employment , relationship , behavioral problem , treatment engagement ) .</detailed_description>
