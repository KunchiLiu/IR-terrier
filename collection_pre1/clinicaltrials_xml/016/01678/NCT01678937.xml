	<brief_title>Immune Tolerance Alloreactivity Liver Transplant Recipients Different Monotherapy Immunosuppressive Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life-long immunosuppressive therapy typically required majority liver allograft recipient . In early year liver transplantation ( LT ) , majority death occur secondary graft loss acute chronic rejection despite immunosuppression ( IS ) . With advent powerful specific IS agent , e.g . calcineurin-inhibitors ( CNIs ) cyclosporine ( CyA ) tacrolimus ( TAC ) , graft rejection rate significantly decline short long term graft/patient survival dramatically improve . However , along advance survival rate come adverse effect long term immunosuppression ( IS ) , e.g . morbidity mortality cardiovascular event , renal insufficiency , infectious complication , recurrent viral hepatitis malignancy . These event exacerbate pre-existing condition age transplant population . Immunosuppression taper withdrawal could lower incidence complication improve long term graft patient survival . Therefore , study propose laboratory investigation ( use blood sample collect subject ) compare immune tolerance alloreactivity profile LT recipient monotherapy IS convert rapamycin monotherapy , determine tolerogenic property different IS agent . Knowledge property would support need specific IS therapy promote immune tolerance consider IS withdrawal . Monotherapy patient identify organ transplant database medical chart Northwestern . Patients invited participate study ask undergo venipuncture analysis . Patient demographic , laboratory clinical data record . Patients CNI monotherapy continuously identify conversion rapamycin monotherapy clinic visit chart review Northwestern . Patients select conversion due significant CNI side effect , e.g . chronic kidney disease ( creatinine clearance &lt; 50 absence significant proteinuria &gt; 1g , poorly control diabetes mellitus/hypertension/hyperlipidemia , peripheral neuropathy ) . In general , patient convert CNIs rapamycin 2-3 week therapeutic rapamycin level achieve . Study procedure carry investigator associate personnel . Patients assign number numerical order , remove patient identifier data analysis . A separate screening/enrollment log keep separate data . Baseline characteristic patient record : age , sex , liver disease , past medical history , history acute rejection graft dysfunction , post-LT complication , previous current IS regimen . Monotherapy patient ( 10 CyA , Tacrolimus , MMF ; 5 rapamycin ) identify asked participate . Blood drawn one time point follow analysis : - Dendritic cell assay : myeloid vs. lymphoid ( CD11c ; CD123 ) ; maturation ability process antigen ( CD83 ; CD205 ) ; marker show induce regulatory T cell ( ILT3 ; ILT4 ) . - Regulatory/Suppressor Cells ( CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CD127low ; CD8+ CD28- FOXP3+CD127low cell ) . - HLA microchimerism &amp; HLA G Ten patient pre-selected rapamycin conversion assay perform two week prior conversion 3-6 month follow conversion . They also liver function drug level test .</detailed_description>
