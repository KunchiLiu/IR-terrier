	<brief_title>Optimization PCR Technique Assess Parasitological Response Patients With Chronic Chagas Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chagas Disease ( CD ) rank among world 's neglected disease . In Latin America , 21 country endemic CD estimate 108 million people risk contract disease . Estimates 1980s indicate 16 -18 million individual infect . In 1990s , series multinational control initiative , estimate number infect people revise 9.8 million 2001 . The estimate burden disease term disability-adjusted life year ( DALYs ) decline 2.7 million 1990 586,000 2001 . Recent estimate Pan-American Health Organization ( PAHO ) , 2006 indicate 7.54 million infected people 55,185 new case per year . CD , also know American trypanosomiasis , zoonotic disease cause protozoan hemoflagellate Trypanosoma cruzi mainly transmit large , blood-sucking , reduviid bug subfamily Triatominae . Clinically , human CD two phase , acute chronic . The acute phase , last week , febrile toxemic illness , parasite detect direct examination fresh blood . In chronic phase , diagnosis depend hemocultures vary degree sensitivity , xenodiagnosis , PCR detect IgG antibody . Untreated , chronic phase continue rest person 's life . It begin specific symptom clinical manifestation period approximately 10 15 year , `` indeterminate form '' disease . About 20 50 % chronic Chagas patient ensue year , depend endemic area analyze , develop involvement heart gastrointestinal tract . Current therapy CD limit two nitroheterocyclic drug , Nifurtimox Benznidazole , later widely use drug Chagas disease treatment . The indication treatment acute disease ( include congenital infection ) , early chronic disease ( , child &lt; 15 year age patient early phase chronic infection ) , plus reactivation infection immunosuppression . Late chronic phase treat clinician 's discretion . In hierarchy need , argue patient indeterminate phase disease would represent main target population evaluation new treatment . With decrease incidence disease , even country high number new case , high disease burden among patient asymptomatic , chronic phase disease . Bolivia , example , least 200,000 child age 15 year 1 million adult infected T. cruzi , estimate total 700,000 people indeterminate form asymptomatic , chronic phase . The development effective affordable treatment million people ongoing infection prevention chronic complication recognize key disease control priority CD . The evaluation cure consider complex aspect treatment CD , lead often diverse controversial result . The term parasitological cure difficult interpretation evaluation challenging , light need total elimination parasite blood also tissue . Clinical cure demand long-term evaluation often uncertain nature due pathogenesis disease , action parasite , host response consequent clinical manifestation evolve long period time . Over recent year increase body data point strong biological rationale use parasitological outcome surrogate marker acute indeterminate Chagas disease . There increase evidence role T. cruzi persistence perpetuation immune response evolution disease . Also , recent non-randomized clinical trial long-term follow-up demonstrate positive effect anti-parasitic chemotherapy patient chronic CD correlation finding serology result . Therefore , purpose clinical development proof-of-concept , suggest parasitological serological test use assessment response acute chronic disease . A negative direct smear end treatment generally accept evidence response acute patient . In chronic disease , serial hemoculture , xenodiagnosis PCR use support serological assessment positive parasitological result indicate treatment failure . Hemoculture xenodiagnosis technique may present low sensitivity chronic patient , require proper resources/infrastructure skilful personnel . In regard conventional serology , indeterminate chronic patient , decrease antibody titer may take 5 year seroconversion negative occur 5-10 year . In consequence , propose efficacy assessment clinical study indeterminate disease do use qualitative quantitative PCR . However , significant variability clinical sensitivity specificity PCR publish study , difference see across phase disease number technique use require standardization . In particular , concern regard sensitivity PCR chronic Chagas disease due low level circulate parasite natural fluctuation parasitaemia . Latest study show broad dynamic range PCR use allow direct measurement case high parasitic load immunosuppressed Chagas disease patient congenitally infected newborn , well case low parasitaemia , patient indeterminate phase etiological treatment . PCR test also use early detection T. cruzi reactivation heart transplantation , document detection parasitic load increase , previous diagnosis clinical reactivation . In addition , accrue clinical experimental data suggest degree correlation parasitaemia tissue infection . Another important advance recent year TDR sponsored-study standardization laboratory validation qualitative PCR test T. cruzi . Standardized procedure qualitative assessment PCR ( standard real-time PCR ) yield high analytical sensitivity specificity , reproducibility , low level intra- inter-assay variation accuracy select . Results exercise present meeting Buenos Aires , Nov 08 , expect publish near future . However , limited information efficacy treatment chronic indeterminate CD patient , study employ PCR assess parasitological response . A panel expert CD three meeting host DNDi CD protocol development team give support evaluation PCR marker parasitological response indeterminate chronic disease . During discussion , consensus value use serial blood collection qualitative PCR assay order increase PCR test sensitivity . Data support information limit Argentinean cohort 41 pregnant woman followed-up monthly blood collection . In small group , PCR sensitivity 60,2 % single collection , 74 % 2 blood collection 80,5 % 3 blood collection ( A. Schijman , manuscript preparation ) . In addition , study Castro publish 2002 indicated significant increase 70.0 % 81.7 % sensitivity PCR addition second sample ( P=0.03 ) . The addition third sample lead non-significant increase sensitivity 86.7 % . Unfortunately , sample size small , indication interval sample qualitative PCR technique non-standardised . During panel discussion , agreement precise interval serial sampling , view lack information support definite interval blood sample maximize sensitivity . Data obtain xenodiagnosis suggest absence circadian rhythm T. cruzi periodicity chronic chagasic individual . Therefore , define sampling procedure , one would need balance gain PCR sensitivity logistics/feasibility conduct clinical trial field set . In order prepare future clinical trial CD , DNDi acknowledge need evaluate optimize procedure PCR implementation tool parasitological assessment patient chronic indeterminate form CD . Study ethical approval seek Médecins Sans Frontières Ethical Review Board , Ethical Review Board Colectivo de Estudios Aplicados Desarollo Social ( CEADES ) , Cochabamba , Bolivia . Furthermore , study submit review National Chagas Control Program 'Comité de Ética e Investigación ' del Ministerio de Salud , Bolivia . This descriptive study aim ass whether multiple PCR blood sampling procedure baseline provide high sensitivity compare single sampling , well feasibility field set . Blood sample baseline EOT follow : one initial blood sample 10 mL ( Sample 1 ) , follow 1 blood sample 5mL collect immediately follow ( Sample 2 ) ; plus one blood sample 10mL collect 1 week later ( Sample 3 ) . Total 3 blood sample . At 6 12 month follow-up visit , optimal sample strategy EOT use . Sampling strategy : In order explore PCR sensitivity accord number blood sample , PCR result analyze single assay well , data analysis stage , combine PCR result patient give time-point . - Reference use Current strategy ( CS ) : Sample 1 : Single sample 10 ml Two major type strategy may develop need assessment : - Reinforcement Strategy ( RS ) consist add blood sampling ( ) current single-sample approach ( volume 10 ml ) . Unless additional sampling allow detection additional PCR-positive case ( unlikely ) strategy inevitably sensitive current one . - Substitution Strategy ( SS ) consist replace current approach ( sample 1 = 10 ml ) 5 ml sampling ( sample 2 ) possibly sample ( ) ( sample 3 ) . These strategy necessarily well current one .
