	<brief_summary>Infertility affect approximately one six couples1 . In approximately one third case , cause find couple unable conceive2 . In order natural pregnancy occur , sperm must pass cervix ( neck womb ) swim woman 's Fallopian tube fertilisation one woman 's eggs occur . It known mid-cycle mucus cervix essential sperm gain access uterus tube . There evidence composition mucus woman may affect fertility area study well recent year , partly fertility treatment IVF bypass cervix . Research sheep cow UCD show interesting difference cervical mucus fertile infertile animal . It appear mucus help sperm get uterus may also help sperm mature ready fertilise egg . This mucus may also help prevent bacteria infection reach womb . In conjunction colleague UCD , leadership Professor S Carrington , investigator would like investigate property human cervical mucus.The investigator propose take sample cervical mucus around time ovulation also approximately one week later fertile woman sub-fertile woman . Then monitor ovulation ultrasound scan ( follicle track ) woman 's ovary urinary ovulation kit take blood oestrogen , progesterone , LH FSH level . The investigator wish determine difference mucus woman may impact sperm function fertility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Mucus - Biochemical Molecular Properties Fertile Subfertile Women ( C-MIS Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate functional , biochemical molecular property cervical mucus various time menstrual cycle fertile sub-fertile woman . The investigator would aim also investigate interaction cervical mucus sperm capacitation investigate impact cervical surgery differ diagnosis sub-fertility cervical mucus . Study aim : 1 . To determine functional , biochemical molecular property cervical mucus menstrual cycle fertile woman . 2 . To determine difference property cervical mucus fertile sub-fertile woman . 3 . To determine whether property influence sub-fertility diagnostic group eg unexplained , endometriosis , tubal factor , sperm factor . 4 . To examine interaction cervical mucus sperm woman normal fertility sub-fertility . 5 . To examine impact cervical surgery cervical mucus functional , biochemical molecular property sperm interaction .</detailed_description>
