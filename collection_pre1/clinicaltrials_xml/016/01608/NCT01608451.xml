	<brief_summary>Randomized Controlled Trial Neoadjuvant Progesterone Vitamin D3 woman Large Operable Breast Cancer Locally Advanced Breast Cancer - A Feasibility Study Primary Progesterone Timing surgery menstrual cycle impact survival premenopausal woman operable breast cancer extensively research reinvestigated Badwe et al randomized clinical trial 'Primary Progesterone Therapy Operable Breast Cancer ' Tata Memorial Hospital . The underlying assumption presence unopposed estrogen ( follicular phase ) time surgery may deleterious survival circulate progesterone might counteract deleterious effect . Vitamin D3 The prominent physiological role hormonally active form vitamin D3 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 calcitriol ) , regulation calcium phosphorous homeostasis bone metabolism via intracellular receptor ( VDR ) member steroid thyroid hormone super-family receptor . The VDR receptor also find tissue like breast prostate . Vitamin D compound also implicate promotion apoptosis breast cancer cell evidence suggest 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthetic analogue may potentiate responsiveness breast cancer cell conventional cytotoxic agent . Objectives 1 . To see effect primary progesterone survival woman high risk breast cancer ( large operable locally advanced breast cancer ) 2 . To see effect Vitamin D3 antiproliferative , cytotoxic apoptotic agent ( negative growth regulator ) evaluation surrogate marker proliferation apoptosis . Inclusion Criteria : - Unilateral breast cancer - Large operable breast cancer/LOBC ( T3N0M0 T3N1M0 ) Locally advance breast cancer/LABC ( T3N1-2M0 ; T2N2M0 ) - Age &lt; 70 year - Fit CT Exclusion Criteria : - Prior Incision Biopsy Excision Biopsy - Metastatic breast cancer - Renal failure derange Renal Function Test - Hypoparathyroidism - Pregnant lactate mother woman childbearing age practice contraception - Patient follow drug : Magnesium-containing antacid , Digitalis , Phenytoin barbiturates , Thiazide diuretic . - Previous history cancer except cured skin cervical carcinoma situ . Methodology / Treatment plan The study drug ( Injectable Progesterone Vitamin D3 ) test neoadjuvant set prior administration chemotherapy cycle , 2x2 factorial design : Neoadjuvant D3 administer Inj . Arachitol 300,000 IU/ml intramuscular , chemotherapy cycle . Neoadjuvant Progesterone use administer single IM depot injection 500mg 5 day prior CT cycle surgery date . Primary Objectives Disease-free survival Secondary Objectives Improvements overall survival Tumor response</brief_summary>
