	<brief_summary>Esophageal cancer ( EC ) eighth common cause cancer-related death worldwide . Systemic chemotherapy patient metastatic EC limit effectiveness , result median survival 8 month 10months . The low activity brief duration benefit chemotherapy palliate advance disease make clear need identify new active agent . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) often over-expressed , related poor prognosis patient EC . The association EGFR-activated signaling pathway tumor cell survival well document many study . Some EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) already show clinical efficacy EC . A study erlotinib show objective response rate 15 % ( 2 13 patient ) , activity limit squamous cell type.8 In another study , thirty patient malignant solid tumor treat BIBW2992 , irreversible inhibitor EGFR HER2 , one four EC patient achieve partial response . PF-00299804 second-generation quinazoline-based irreversible pan-HER inhibitor . In preclinical study , PF-00299804 much low IC50 value gefitinib cell line engineer express EGFRvIII mutation ( 1.2 nM versus 2,700 nM ) produce tumor growth inhibition gefitinib-resistant xenograft . PF-00299804 reportedly clinical anti-tumor activity patient non-small cell lung cancer head neck squamous cell carcinoma manageable toxicity . The aim current trial evaluate antitumor efficacy safety profile PF-00299804 identify biomarker predict tumor response PF-00299804 .</brief_summary>
