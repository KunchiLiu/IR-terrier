	<detailed_description>Background : Fructose become focus intense concern regard link obesity epidemic increase burden cardiometabolic disease . There dozens editorial , commentary , letter scientific literature numerous piece lay social medium call effort restrict intake even regulate like tobacco alcohol . Uncontrolled ecological analysis link increase fructose intake increase obesity , diabetes , hypertension rate animal model fructose induced metabolic syndrome hypertension , overfeed fructose level exposure far beyond actual population level intake , use underpin debate . Evidence well-adjusted prospective cohort study also suggest positive association consumption sugar-sweetened beverage increase energy consumption weight gain . But meta-analyses available prospective cohort study support conclusion SSBs , meta-analyses investigate effect total fructose-containing sugar also include grain fruit source incident overweight/obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , hypertension , gout , cardiovascular disease . Despite limitation extrapolate available observational data inconsistency data control trial human ( high level evidence use evidence base medicine ) show adverse metabolic effect isocaloric feed condition , heart diabetes association take risk reduction approach add fructose-containing sugar , set highly restrictive upper threshold intake achieve maintain healthy body-weights avoid adverse lipid effect . Objective : To improve evidence recommendation public health policy base , conduct series systematic review meta-analyses role fructose-containing sugar development cardiometabolic disease prospective cohort study . A total 5 analysis propose : ( 1 ) overweight/obesity , ( 2 ) diabetes/metabolic syndrome , ( 3 ) hypertension , ( 4 ) gout , ( 5 ) coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies Epidemiology ( MOOSE ) guideline . Data source . MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term , supplement manual , hand search bibliography . Study selection : We include prospective cohort study investigate relation fructose-containing ( fructose , sucrose , HFCS ) sugar incident overweight/obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , hypertension , gout , cardiovascular disease . Data extraction . Two investigator independently extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , fructose form , fructose exposure level , duration/person-years follow-up , background diet profile , adjustment model . Risk ratios clinical outcome extract derived clinical event data across quantiles exposure . Risk bias assess use Cochrane Risk Bias tool . Outcomes : Each 5 propose analysis assess different cardiometabolic disease outcome : ( 1 ) overweight/obesity , ( 2 ) diabetes/metabolic syndrome , ( 3 ) hypertension , ( 4 ) gout , ( 5 ) CHD . Data synthesis . The natural log-transformed relative risk clinical outcome compare high exposure level reference group cohort pool use generic inverse variance method random effect model . Heterogeneity assess Cochrane 's Q quantify I2 . Sensitivity analyse priori subgroup analyse undertaken explore source heterogeneity include effect underlie disease status , sex , sugar type ( fructose , sucrose , HFCS ) , follow-up ( &lt; 10-years , &gt; =10-years ) , level adjustment model , Cochrane risk bias effect fructose . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analyse . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . Dose-response analysis undertaken use random-effects generalize least square trend estimation model ( GLST ) , appropriate weight regression summarize dose-response data dependent component ( i.e . reference exposure level ) . If insufficient evidence linear relationship find , spline curve modeling ( MKSPLINE procedure ) characterize segment dose response curve linear approximation best describes data . Publication bias assess inspection funnel plot use Begg 's Egger 's test . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition , diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Preliminary finding : To address uncertainty evidence , conduct series Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) fund systematic review meta-analyses control feeding trial effect fructose cardiometabolic risk ( ClinicalTrials.gov registration number : NCT01363791 ) . We find fructose isocaloric substitution source carbohydrate ( isocaloric trial ) increase body weight , lipid , blood pressure , uric acid , insulin even improve glycemic control . There , however , signal harm certain condition . High dos fructose increase triglyceride isocaloric trial , fructose provide excess energy extreme dose relative control diet ( hypercaloric trial ) also increase body weight , triglyceride , uric acid . The implication find `` real world '' dietary advice , however , complicate several factor . First , fructose commonly consume isolation sweetener . Sucrose HFCS primary fructose-containing sweetener U.S. diet . Second , level fructose exposure available trial well population level intake , exceed 95th-percentile U.S. intake isocaloric trial hypercaloric trial , excess energy bring fructose important source confounding . Finally , available trial investigate effect biomarkers disease clinically meaningful event . The propose systematic review meta-analyses prospective cohort study address limitation directly investigate relation self-reported , `` real world '' intake fructose-containing sugar ( fructose , sucrose , HFCS ) development overweight/obesity , diabetes/metabolic syndrome , hypertension , gout , cardiovascular disease . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate effect dietary fructose overweight/obesity , diabetes/metabolic syndrome , hypertension , gout , cardiovascular disease , strengthen evidence-base recommendation improve health outcome inform consumer guide future research .</detailed_description>
