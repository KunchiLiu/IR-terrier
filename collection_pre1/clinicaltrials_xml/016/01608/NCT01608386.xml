	<brief_summary>Anterior approach result well operative survival outcome compare conventional approach patient large hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , anterior approach problem bleed hepatic vein . Our previous study show infrahepatic inferior vena cava ( IVC ) clamp reduce blood loss conventional hepatic resection . The investigator guess infrahepatic IVC clamping may also reduce blood loss anterior approach right hepatic resection . So investigators conduct prospective , randomize , control trial compare anterior approach combine infrahepatic IVC clamp anterior approach major right hepatectomy large HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Anterior Approach Combined With Infrahepatic Inferior Vena Cava Clamping</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally , mobilisation right hemiliver follow right hepatic vein control parenchymal transection consider standard approach major right hepatectomy . However , approach often difficult hazardous perform liver resection large hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) tumor extrahepatic organ invasion right retrohepatic region.In set right hepatectomy anterior approach , liver mobilisation perform end parenchymal transection , vascular connection already interrupted.The anterior approach find associate significantly less intraoperative blood loss , less blood transfusion low hospital mortality rate.However , excessive bleeding occur deep plane parenchymal transection right hepatic vein middle hepatic vein . Bleeding hepatic vein closely related CVP.Our previous retrospective analysisfound infrahepatic inferior vena cava ( IVC ) clamp efficacious reduce CVP without need systemic fluid restriction associate significantly less intraoperative blood loss complex hepatectomy . The aim present study therefore evaluate application anterior approach combine infrahepatic IVC clamp right hepatectomy large HCC reduces intraoperative blood loss .</detailed_description>
