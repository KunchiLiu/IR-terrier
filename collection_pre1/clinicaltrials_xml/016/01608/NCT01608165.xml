	<brief_summary>The number people diagnose kidney cancer double past 20 year , make eight common cancer UK . Most tumours less 4cm size , 80 % malignant ( cancerous ) leave untreated , slowly grow spread . Current standard treatment small kidney cancer remove diseased part kidney operation call partial nephrectomy , quite difficult operation . Because small tumour size difficulty operation , treatment develop destroy tumour . These treatment include radiofrequency ablation , mean tumour destroyed heat , cryoablation , mean tumour frozen destroyed . Although remove part diseased kidney operation try tested way treat kidney cancer , risk complication , bleed . The two treatment less intrusive patient , less complicated require large operation part kidney remove , know good destroying tumour , whether patient tumour destroyed new method require treatment future . In study , investigator try determine large-scale study compare treatment possible call feasibility study . The investigator also look whether patient would willing randomly assign treatment group . The result study compare see effective treatment whether number patient happy randomly assign treatment could use determine number patient require large-scale trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial Compare Surgery With Needle Ablation Techniques People With Small Renal Masses ( 4cm )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicentre study determine possible carry future trial compare effectiveness two minimally invasive technique remove small kidney cancer , standard treatment remove part diseased kidney . In future study , participant randomly assign ( randomise ) one three treatment option . This current study look whether patient would willing randomised treatment type , whether sufficient number large trial would likely recruit within certain time period , also decide aspect conduct outcome three treatment type would need record largescale trial compare effectiveness . Eligible participant study identify invited take part study clinicians currently involve kidney cancer assessment . They would receive information surgery treatment ( remove disease part kidney ) one alternative treatment method ( destroy kidney cancer tumour use either heat freezing ) participate hospital . If patient interested participating study , ask consent randomise one two treatment type give information . If patient decline randomise treatment , ask participate series interview , establish reason behind decline , preference one treatment . Those patient consent randomised one treatment arm undergo screen visit confirm eligibility study , visit blood sampke take ask complete questionnaire general health feel . This questionnaires complete late date treatment compare patient respond treatment , order look change improvement patient . Once confirm eligible , randomised treatment arm , , hospital appointment treatment also make time . At treatment visit , patient admit hospital treatment schedule , keep hospital recommend duration operation . Those diseased part kidney remove keep hospital 35 day , kidney cancer freeze use cryoablation keep hospital 2 day , kidney cancer destroy use heat ( radiofrequency ablation ) keep one day . As per standard care , duration time hospital could vary patient experience unexpected complication . They also blood sample take visit ass kidney function . All treatment give qualified specialist surgeon extensive experience treatment give patient . Three month treatment , patient ask return hospital followup visit . At visit , patient ask complete questionnaire complete previously , well undertake CT scan ass treatment give successful determine kidney cancer remove destroy . This CT scan patient undergo cryoablaton treatment . Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation treatment CT scan one month treatment . All patient also blood sample take visit ass kidney funtion . Six month treatment , patient ask return hospital followup visit , point patient undergoing cryoablation treatment CT scan ass treatment remain success , determine kidney cancer still destroy whether return . They ask complete questionnaire previous visit one time , compare feel general health improve change previously . Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation treatment cryoablation treatment require attend final visit within 2 week 6 month followup visit order kidney biopsy take determine treatment remain success cancer mass destroy . After six month , five visit , patient return normal standard clinical followup visit , would whether study . As well mention visit , patient consent randomise , also ask consent involve series interview , time ask general question feel general treatment receive .</detailed_description>
