	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn high tolerable dose combination curcumin , vorinostat , sorafenib give patient advance solid cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Curcumin , Vorinostat , Sorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Curcumin active ingredient spice , turmeric . It natural anti-inflammatory compound show anti-tumor activity laboratory clinical trial . Vorinostat design cause chemical change different kind protein attach DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may slow growth cancer cell cause cancer cell die . Sorafenib design block ability important protein activate cancer cell . These protein , active , part responsible abnormal growth behavior cancer cell . Blocking activity may slow growth cancer cell cause cancer cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level study drug combination ( curcumin , vorinostat , sorafenib ) base join study . Up 9 dose level study drug combination test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level study drug combination . The first group participant receive low dose level study drug combination . Each new group receive high dose study drug combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . The dose study drug combination receive may lower experience intolerable side effect . You receive dos study drug combination high dose level first assign . Study Drug Administration : For purpose study , study drug `` cycle '' 28 day long . Starting Day 1 Cycle 1 , begin take curcumin 1 time daily . Starting Day 3 Cycle 1 , take vorinostat 1 time daily . Starting Day 5 Cycle 1 , begin take sorafenib 1-2 time daily depend dose level assign . From day forward , continue take study drug combination every day cycle . Curcumin powder come paper packet , take mouth full glass water ( 8 oz. ) . Vorinostat sorafenib capsule take mouth . Vorinostat take food . Sorafenib take without food . The capsule swallow whole . You break , chew , open capsule . Baseline Tests : The following test procedure perform within 7 day first dose study drug combination ( Day 1 Cycle 1 ) : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature ) . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect routine test . - You echocardiogram ( ECHO ) check heart function . - Women able become pregnant must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . In order continue participation study , pregnancy test must negative . Study Visits : Every week receive study drug combination , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Before begin cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . - Urine collect routine test . - You ask side effect may experience . At end every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - You chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . If study doctor think appropriate , additional type scan list consent form may need perform . The study doctor discus scan , may ask sign separate consent form explain detail risk scan . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . Length Study : You may remain study long study doctor think benefit study drug . You take study early disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug combination , come back hospital end-of-study visit follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect routine test . - You ask side effect may experience . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . If study doctor think appropriate , additional type scan list consent form may need perform . The study doctor discus scan , may ask sign separate consent form explain detail risk scan . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . This investigational study . Curcumin commercially available substance , commonly use food additive . Curcumin FDA approve treatment advance solid cancer . At time , curcumin use research . Vorinostat FDA approve commercially available treatment T-cell lymphoma . Sorafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment liver renal cancer . At time , combination curcumin , vorinostat , sorafenib use research . Up 96 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
