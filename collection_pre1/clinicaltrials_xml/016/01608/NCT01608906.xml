	<brief_summary>This study plan learn best treatment prevent blood clot patient intensive care unit ( ICU 's ) . The investigator know patient ICU 's high normal risk get blood clot vein arm leg . This dangerous clot may move lung . To prevent , standard treatment give low dose heparin subcutaneously 3 time day ( usually 5000 unit dose ) . In study investigator randomize patient receive either standard care low dose intravenous heparin continuous infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Intravenous Heparin Versus Standard Care Subcutaneous Heparin Prevent Clots After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macro- micro-thrombosis contribute significantly morbidity mortality surgical intensive care unit . Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) common preventable cause death critically ill patient , mortality rate 10 % . Up 95 % case PE originate deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) . There multiple pharmacologic non-pharmacologic method DVT prophylaxis.The current standard care thromboprophylaxis surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) University Colorado Hospital low-dose subcutaneous heparin ( SCH ) . However , little evidence optimal prophylactic treatment . In fact , database search ICD-9 diagnosis make 2005 suggests incidence DVT SICU patient , majority receive subcutaneous heparin , approximately 7 % . Surgical ICU patient high risk develop DVT hospital stay likely need aggressive anticoagulation . Intravenous heparin , give low dose titrate measurable endpoint PTT ( partial thromboplastin time ) , may offer several benefit current standard care , subcutaneous heparin . This method treatment would offer aggressive anticoagulation allow dosage adjust frequently base patient 's change coagulation status .</detailed_description>
