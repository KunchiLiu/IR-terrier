	<detailed_description>The goal study enable person paralyze spinal cord injury ( SCI ) drive power wheelchair interact computer act interface maximize effectiveness residual motor function . This call `` body-machine interface '' map motion upper-body ( arm shoulder ) space device control signal optimal way . In way , paralyzed person operate joystick controller lack hand mobility effectively use whole upper body virtual joystick device . An important characteristic propose approach base possibility control computer wheelchair bodily movement interactive learning process , interface adapts subject 's mobility subject learn act interface . This study aim develop test customization interface group SCI participant tetraplegia , result high-level cervical injury . The propose research organize three specific aim : ( Aim 1 ) To develop new functional capability person spinal cord injury customize body-machine interface individual upper body mobility . After fit interface residual movement subject , participant practice computer game aim train two class control action : operate virtual joystick operate virtual keyboard . This study test ability subject perform skilled maneuver simulate wheelchair . ( Aim 2 . ) To test hypothesis practice upper-body control personalize interface result significant physical psychological benefit spinal-cord injury . A study evaluate quantify impact practice functional upper-body motion mobility shoulder arm conventional clinical method measure subject ' ability generate coordinate upper body movement apply isometric force . Other study aim evaluate effect operate body-machine interface musculoskeletal pain mood mental state participant . ( Aim 3 ) To train spinal-cord injury survivor skillfully operate power wheelchair use enhanced upper body motor skill customize interface parameter . Finally , last study test hypothesis skill learn practice virtual environment retain control actual power wheelchair . After reach stable performance simulate wheelchair , subject practice control physical wheelchair safe test environment . If successful , study lead effective operation highly customized interface adapts residual motor capability user . Physical psychological benefit expect derive sustain coordinated activity associate use body-machine interface</detailed_description>
