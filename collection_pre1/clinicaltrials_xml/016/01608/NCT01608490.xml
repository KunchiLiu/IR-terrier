	<criteria>Subject great equal 35 yr age CT Scan indicate bilateral emphysema Subject postbronchodilator FEV1 le equal 45 % predict Subject Total Lung Capacity &gt; 100 % predict Subject residual volume ( RV ) great equal 175 % predict Subject mark dyspnea great equal 2 mMRC scale 04 Subject stop smoke least 8 week prior enter study confirm Cotinine test appropriate diagnostic test . Subject complete pulmonary rehabilitation program within 6 mo prior treatment and/or regularly performing maintenance respiratory rehabilitation initial supervise therapy occur 6 mo prior baseline test . Subject receive Pneumococcal Influenza vaccination consistent local recommendation and/or policy . Subject ( legal guardian , applicable ) read , understood , sign Informed Consent form . Subject severe homogeneous emphysema determine Core Radiology Lab . Subject comorbidities may significantly reduce subject 's ability improve exercise capacity ( e.g. , severe arthritis , plan knee surgery ) baseline limitation 6MWT due dyspnea . Subject change FEV1 great 20 % ( , subject prebronchodilator FEV1 1L , change great 200mL ) postbronchodilator unless investigator confirm mean subject asthma . Subject DLCO le 20 % predict . Subject severe gas exchange abnormality , PaCO2 great 55mm Hg ; PaO2 le 45 mm Hg room air ( high altitude criterion : PaO2 le 30mm Hg ) . Subject history recurrent clinically significant respiratory infection , define 3 hospitalization respiratory infection year prior enrollment . Subject severe pulmonary hypertension define right ventricular systolic pressure great 50mm Hg and/or echocardiogram Subject inability walk &gt; 140m ( 150 yd ) 6 minute Subject evidence severe disease ( limited lung cancer renal failure ) , judgment investigator may compromise survival subject duration study . Subject pregnant lactating , plan become pregnant within study timeframe . Subject inability tolerate bronchoscopy moderate sedation general anesthesia . Subject clinically significant bronchiectasis . Subject giant bulla &gt; 1/3 lung volume Subject previous LVR surgery , lung transplantation , lobectomy LVR device either lung . Subject involved pulmonary drug device study within 30 day prior study . Subject take &gt; 20mg prednisone ( equivalent dose similar steroid ) daily . Subject require high level chronic immunomodulatory therapy treat moderate severe chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder . Subject antiplatelet agent ( Plavix ) anticoagulant therapy ( Heparin Coumadin ) stop 7 day prior procedure . Subject disease , condition ( ) habit ( ) would interfere completion study follow assessment , would increase risk bronchoscopy assessment , judgment investigator would potentially interfere compliance study would adversely affect study outcome .
