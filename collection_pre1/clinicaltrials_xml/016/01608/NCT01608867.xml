	<brief_summary>This open-label Phase 1 dose escalation study OMP-54F28 subject solid tumor remain standard curative therapy . Subjects assess safety , immunogenicity , pharmacokinetics , biomarkers , efficacy . No formal interim analysis perform . Prior enrollment , subject undergo screen determine study eligibility . Upon enrollment , subject receive OMP-54F28 disease progression . All subject receive Vitamin D3 daily calcium carbonate twice daily Day 0 30 day follow discontinuation OMP-54F28 . Dose escalation conduct determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Subjects dose 0.5 , 1 , 2.5 , 5 , 10 mg/kg administer IV every 3 week . No dose escalation reduction allow within dose cohort . Intermediate dos ( i.e. , dos dose level list ) may also test upon agreement investigator study sponsor . In addition , alternate dose schedule cohort OMP-54F28 ( eg . every 4 week every 6 week dose ) study upon agreement investigator study sponsor . These alternative less frequent dose schedule may evaluate emerge data suggest every 3 week dose result tolerability concern . The first 2 subject enrol cohort treat day . The dose may administer time day . Three subject treat dose level dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe . If 1 3 subject experience DLT , dose level expand 6 subject . If 2 subject experience DLT , subject dose level 3 additional subject add precede dose cohort unless 6 subject already treat dose level . Subjects assess DLTs Days 0-28 . Dose escalation newly enrol subject , appropriate , occur subject cohort complete Day 28 DLT assessment . Subjects &gt; 2-fold increase fast β-CTX decline &gt; 3 % bone mineral density ( BMD ) screen T-score decline &lt; -2.5 total femur L1-L4 DEXA scan measurement start zoledronic acid . Subjects stable disease response Day 56 allow continue receive OMP-54F28 disease progression . An additional 6 subject enrolled expansion cohort high dose level result &lt; 2 6 subject experience Grade 3 ( include Grade 3 infusion reaction resolve 24 hour ) Grade 4 adverse event ( DLT ) . Tumors particular interest inclusion expansion cohort include sarcoma , basal cell carcinoma , ovarian cancer , desmoid tumor prostate cancer give know importance Wnt pathway malignancy .</brief_summary>
