	<detailed_description>Background / rationale Despite overwhelm need effective HIV palliative care sub-Saharan Africa ( evidence epidemiology primarily HIV cancer ) , systematic appraisal literature find almost outcome evaluative evidence . Further systematic review palliative care HIV palliative care effectiveness find evidence generate mainly high income country , advent antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) evidence Africa generally low quality ( i.e . non-trial data ) limit potential inclusion evidence-based health care plan delivery . In order influence clinical practice , policy guideline , essential provide high quality trial evidence effectiveness palliative care people ART . In order achieve goal maximum coverage , capacity building exist HIV care service provide palliative care patient seem feasible . Further , evidence demonstrates pain symptom burden ART different ART , therefore key role palliative care may support access treatment . Our propose study develop model care extend palliative care delivery exist HIV/ART delivery site , offer mechanism great coverage feasibility alternative approach referral palliative care-related problem specialist external provider . - Aim We aim evaluate efficacy HIV palliative care train simple palliative care assessment tool provide nurse patient ART , evaluate term patient outcomes clinical experimental condition 2 African country use randomise control trial ( RCT ) design . - Intervention test Within well-established HIV ART clinic , patient randomly allocate either continue receive standard care ( control group ) receive standard care plus appointment clinic nurse train basic palliative care ( intervention group ) . The intervention nurse receive weekly supervision local palliative care service use simple assessment form patient appointment . - Methods Design : Each Phase III clinical trial ( i.e . one trial 2 country ) power conduct parallel common research design protocol , thus permit evidence outcome reflect 2 different ART provider , provide evidence palliative care efficacy relevant different HIV care setting . Each 2 HIV care facility ( one Kenya South Africa ) highly experienced HIV ART care provider , proven longevity . The provider palliative care train longstanding expert delivery palliative care train palliative care . Primary outcome : Each trial power primary endpoint pain control . Secondary outcome : The secondary outcome core domain palliative care define WHO ( i.e . physical , include symptom , psychological , social spiritual ) measure APCA African POS . Further secondary outcome measure : adherence treatment ; risk behaviour ; health-related quality life ; additional measure psychological morbidity . The primary secondary outcome country 's trial . This study aim reject null hypothesis receipt palliative care addition standard care affect pain compare receive standard care alone . Inclusion : Patients screen invited trial ART , score 3-5 0-5 APCA African POS pain symptom item , 18 year old , give informed consent trial entry data collection . Analysis : An intention-to-treat analysis conduct determine treatment response difference two condition . In order maximise efficiency longitudinal data , multi-level modelling apply appropriate . - Outputs We select RCT design , multiple country partner , order output maximum potential influence . The revised CONSORT trial statement non-drug trial apply ensure potential publication lead 400 medical journal . In term clinical policy audience finding , inclusion 2 partner country enable u demonstrate efficacy 2 provider ART care ( much heterogeneity HIV care provider Africa ) , maximise ability replicate finding , dissemination describe compare two provider care deliver . In addition journal publication , intend present summary output relevant Country Teams / policy / advocacy stakeholder , present international HIV / palliative care conference audience , provide podcast finding freely download web . Co-applicants Collaborators This application represent highly effective proven group , past 5 year , deliver clinical audit , POS tool development validation , longitudinal study , various patient outcome study HIV palliative care Africa . The University department closely align palliative care field country , offer active clinical / teach / research interface . The collaboration strong track record successfully conduct clinical public health research clinical care . Each collaborate training palliative care centre long stand recognise provider quality palliative care , operate line WHO definition palliative care .</detailed_description>
