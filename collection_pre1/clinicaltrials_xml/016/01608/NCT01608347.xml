	<brief_summary>Recurrent miscarriage ( RM ) traditionally define three consecutive miscarriage occur 20 week post-menstruation . It one common clinical problem reproduction , yet definite cause establish 50 percent case ( ACOG practice bulletin , 2002 ) . Many etiological factor propose none fully substantiate . RM directly associate maternal thrombophilic disorder , parental chromosomal anomaly , structural uterine anomaly indirectly maternal immune dysfunction endocrine abnormality . The association pregnancy loss antiphospholipid antibody ( aPL ) first notice latter third last century . The antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) characterize presence antiphospholipid antibody ( APLA ) , associate venous and/or arterial thrombosis , and/or pregnancy loss . The adverse pregnancy outcomes associate presence APLAs include : recurrent fetal loss , intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , severe pre-eclampsia especially early onset . Testing effect Heparin treatment case RA negative APA bee do animal clinical study . Animal study show subset case disorder suspicious APS negative test result LAC aCL carry antibody pathogenic murine pregnancy . Testing immunoglobulin G may provide additional mean identify case yet uncharacterized immune condition . Moreover , clinical relevance low level APLA woman remain unproved . Randomized prospective study do assess efficacy early thromboprophylaxis Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) ( Enoxaparin sodium 20 mg , daily subcutaneously ) woman history recurrent miscarriage without identifiable cause versus treatment . The result show , significant reduction incidence early late miscarriage ( 8.8 % vs 4.1 % ) ( 2.3 % versus 1.1 % ) without treatment , respectively . Cochrane Database systemic review ( 2005 ) show randomize comparative study treat recurrent miscarriage woman without antiphospholipid syndrome . The first group treat low dose aspirin alone second group treat low dose aspirin + LMWH . The result study show significant difference two group identify need large randomize controlled trial solve problem . The evidence suggest probability presence untested LAC aCL low level APLA commonly use method woman recurrent miscarriage . These antibody may explain recurrent miscarriage case negative antiphospholipid antibody . It remain test efficacy heparin ( proven effective treatment positive antibody ) patient negative antibody . Finding solution frustrate problem may open way unsolved problem . The propose study open label randomize control trial ( RCT ) To evaluate effect LMWH versus heparin treatment recurrent miscarriage negative antiphospholipid antibody test .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Pregnant woman 2035 year age history regular marital life partner . 2 . Had least 3 previous consecutive pregnancy loss 20 week gestation . 3 . Regularly menstruate current pregnancy . 4 . Got spontaneous conception . 5 . Negative antibody test antiphospholipid syndrome . IgG IgM aCL antibody detect enzyme link immunoabsorbent assay ( ELISA . The result consider positive IgG aCL &gt; 8.4 IU/ml ; IgM aCL &gt; 7 IU/ml . 1 . Presence polycystic ovarian syndrome diagnose either history suggestive PCO appearance TV Ultrasonography . 2 . Abnormal uterine cavity prove sonohysterography diagnostic hysteroscopy . 3 . Positive consanguinity two partner . 4 . Presence endocrine abnormality . Glucose tolerance curve do exclude presence diabetes . Other endocrine abnormality exclude history clinical examination . If clinical suspicion raise , required endocrinological test do . 5 . Women refuse participate trial .</criteria>
