	<brief_title>Intraoperative Post-operative Analgesic Effect IV Acetaminophen Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unrelieved postoperative pain may result suffer discomfort , may also lead multiple physiological psychological consequence contribute adverse perioperative outcome . Inadequate perioperative analgesia potentially contribute high incidence myocardial ischemia . Additionally , use opioids associate major side effect include impaired wound heal delay gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility result prolong postoperative ileus . Intravenous acetyl-para-aminophenol ( APAP , also know acetaminophen ) consider non-opioid analgesic choice treat postoperative mild moderate pain , demonstrate several randomized trial safe effective reduce acute post-operative pain child adult . Furthermore , treatment severe pain , reduce need opioid-analgesics exhibit relatively limited side effect profile compare opioids nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug . Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) describe group disorder characterize inflammation nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinuses least 12 consecutive week . In United States , CRS affect approximately 30 million people , represent 2 % primary diagnosis physician office visit , result estimate 200,000 sinus procedure annually . Patients suffer CRS refractory medical management complain symptom include fatigue , headache , nasal drainage , facial pain pressure , decrease sense smell . Functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) represent surgical approach treat CRS unresponsive medical management . Outcomes study identify FESS efficacious reduce majority symptom relate CRS . Despite , pain associate CRS remain significant co-morbidity often resistant medical surgical management . Reducing incidence severity acute post-operative pain paramount reduce development chronic pain may exacerbate patient 's exist pain . The use pre- intra- operative IV acetaminophen thus serve unique pain management modality setting , potential reduce post-operative complication pain , additional benefit minimal intraoperative bleeding , undesirable complication often associate FESS use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . The use IV acetaminophen ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) surgery novel endeavor . Indeed , study demonstrate efficacy safety IV acetaminophen use tonsillectomy FESS . We wish provide comprehensive analysis pain management set FESS follow way : 1. administer IV acetaminophen perioperatively ( start surgery , surgery completion ; 2. employ pain score 4 ( whereas study use 3 ) cutoff breakthrough pain ; , 3. address novel outcome include patient sedation patient satisfaction , addition opioid analgesic use . In institution , complete preliminary pilot study explore use intravenous anesthesia include acetaminophen bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery . Secondary outcome measure study include : 1 . Pain 2 . Rescue analgesic use 3 . Nausea/Vomiting 4 . Time spent recovery 5 . Successful discharge PACU Hospital Our pilot data reaffirm procedure overall benign , associate risk adverse event . Of note , none patient preliminary study require admission hospital surgery observation result uncontrolled pain nausea . Based experience , would like explore efficacy intravenous acetaminophen ( Ofirmev ) , non opioid/non steroidal analgesic , endoscopic sinus surgery .</detailed_description>
