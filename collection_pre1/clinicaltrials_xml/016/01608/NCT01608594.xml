	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Combination Therapy With Ipilimumab HighDose IFN-α2b Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant therapy allow new insight melanoma biological immunologic response therapeutic intervention , ipilimumab . Neoadjuvant ipilimumab therapy high-risk melanoma patient bulky regional stage IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result improved clinical outcome group patient likely respond immunotherapeutic intervention without increased morbidity . Through design neoadjuvant trial possible obtain biopsy sample , great understanding dynamic interaction tumor immune system possible . This lead identification new target treatment melanoma aid development new combination may great efficacy acceptable toxicity , build clinical , immunologic , molecular effect therapy patient melanoma .</detailed_description>

NOTE : All patient must determine surgically resectable baseline eligible neoadjuvant study . Patients must undergo biopsy ( punch ) open biopsy ( do part clinically indicated baseline diagnostic procedure ) within 14 day entry study . Lymphadenectomy/definitive surgery perform least 2 generally longer 4 week induction HDIipilimumab therapy . Additional delay definitive lymphadenectomy/surgery allow clinically indicate await resolution potential adverse event HDIipilimumab therapy . Patients must evaluate standardofcare full body image study ( CT , PETCT MRI ) part initial clinical workup baseline ( 4 week prior study enrollment ) completion induction HDIipilimumab ( 68 week first dose ipilimumab/HDI prior definitive lymphadenectomy procedure ) . Required value initial laboratory test : WBC ≥ 3000/uL ANC ≥ 1500/uL Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.8 mg/dL AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN , ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Clinical , radiological/laboratory , pathological evidence distant metastatic disease . Evidence soft tissue involvement gross extranodal extension tumor manifest fixation fascia , mat nodal tissue would compromise surgical resection determine surgical oncologist .

Autoimmune disease exclusion : history inflammatory bowel disease , history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome ) . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator/SubInvestigator make administration ipilimumab HDI hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . Underlying heart condition deem ineligible surgery cardiology consult . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 1 month dose ipilimumab ) . Prior treatment ipilimumab CD137 agonist CTLA4 inhibitor agonist . Prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , include infusion perfusion therapy current disease immunotherapy include tumor vaccine , interferonalfa , interleukin , levamisole biologic response modifier within past 4 week . Concomitant therapy following : IL 2 nonstudy immunotherapy regimens ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ; unless discontinue ≥ 4 week .
