	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Effectiveness Metacognitive Therapy Treatment Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder disable condition adversely affect person 's family , work school life , sleep eat habit , general health . Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) recommend treatment depression , large number clinical trial support efficacy . However , despite success CBT relative treatment , 40-58 % patient receive CBT may classify recover use clinical significant change assess Beck Depression Inventory . Moreover , research demonstrate one-third one quarter patient receive CBT remain recovered 18 month follow-up . A new treatment approach MDD Meta-Cognitive Therapy . In treatment approach , MDD conceptualize maintain rumination meta-cognitions . Treatment seek challenge change specific meta-cognitions rumination , behavioural experiment verbal reattribution . No randomized control study compare effectiveness MCT waiting-list condition MDD . Related , study examine specific element therapy hypothesize importance change rumination , lead positive treatment outcome . The purpose trial investigate efficacy Wells ' MCT Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Another aim examine in-treatment process associate positive treatment outcome . The study randomize control , trial comprise 50 patient primary diagnosis major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV ; APA , 1994 ) . Experienced diagnostician assess patient use structural interview SCID-I , SCID II Hamilton Rating Scale Depression . All patient randomize block two group order compare follow condition : MCT wait list control condition . After wait period 10 week , patient wait-list condition allocate treatment condition . Both between-subjects within-subjects comparison conduct . The research trial conduct outpatient-clinic Department Psychology , Norwegian University Science Technology Trondheim , Norway . Questions address : 1 . Are effect MCT possible replicate separate research group ( clinical group develop method ) ? 2 . Is MCT well waitlist condition ? 3 . Is change positive negative appraisal rumination predictive treatment outcome ? 4 . What effect size MCT depression ? How relapse prevention MCT ? 5 . Does treatment effect co-morbid anxiety disorder ( ) ? 6 . What treatment element predict outcome MCT ? 7 . What effect treatment stable personality trait link depression anxiety ( e.g. , neuroticism ) ? The meta-cognitive treatment program base Wells ' manual . The patient receive meta-cognitive therapy treat maximum 10 session , weekly session 45-60 minute duration . In first treatment session , idiosyncratic case formulation base MCT model depression build share patient . Socialization model follow , emphasize rumination high level self focus ( e.g. , focus negative thought feeling ) maintain depression . At end first treatment session , attention training ( ATT ) introduce method counteract excessive self-focus , help patient ' switch meta-cognitive mode processing . ATT auditory attention task consist three stage ; selective attention , attention switch divided attention . The task take approximately 10 minute , practice session , patient ask implement ATT daily homework assignment . In-session practice ATT use throughout treatment . In next session , treatment focus careful identification rumination , modify related positive negative belief . Verbal reattribution strategy use modify negative belief concern uncontrollable nature rumination . This follow training patient 'detached mindfulness ' , couple rumination postponement experiment challenge belief rumination uncontrollable . Patients ask whether ever notice negative thought , choose engage . In context , engagement mean rumination , analysis thought , cognitive avoidance form processing thought . Patients may still motivate use rumination cop strategy positive belief rumination remain . To counteract positive belief , analysis advantage disadvantage rumination undertaken demonstrate rumination maintain depression effective method cop . The final treatment session focus relapse prevention modification positive negative meta-cognitive belief , include erroneous belief recurrence emotion deviation mood . Relapse prevention involve development therapy blueprint include write diagrammatic formulation meta-cognitive model depression . A detailed account main therapeutic strategy use treatment provide , along specific plan patient implement guide think behavioral style responses future negative mood . Patients encourage implement strategy maintain strengthen gain make course treatment . The treatment administer accord originator publish treatment protocol MCT . Independent assessor assess adherence quality treatment . Independent expert assess quality treatment inspection sample video-recorded treatment . Using checklist session-by-session ensure adherence therapy . Responsible investigator supervisor use video treatment session assess adherence treatment condition . 1 . All patient refer university clinic consecutively assess intake ( SCID-I + II , HDRS-17 ) . Based diagnosis criterion inclusion exclusion , patient ask volunteer participate study confirm sign form consent . 2 . Patients randomize one two condition . 3 . Patients ask self-rate symptom battery self-report questionnaire . 4 . Meta-cognitive therapy give patient group 1 , group 2 wait list control . Waiting list control rat treated wait treatment 10 week . 5 . After 10 week wait list control transfer treatment group . 6 . The patient assess prior treatment , 10 week treatment , six month , one two year follow-up . 7 . Reassessment diagnosis symptom severity make post-treatment . Criteria recovery : Jacobsen criterion minimum change patient cross cut-off point two measure : The HDRS-17 BDI . Other outcome measure include : - Reduction depressive symptom measure self-report questionnaire - Number patient MDD diagnosis base SCID-I treatment - Relapse rate six month , one two year follow-up The proportion responder measure HDRS-17 BDI long fulfil condition MDD diagnosis post-treatment 6 month one two year follow-up . The secondary efficacy variable proportion responder post-treatment six month , one two year follow-up measure symptom measure . In addition , proportion responder measure MDD-S relapse rate two one year follow-up select one secondary efficacy variable . A comparison two group patient conduct post-treatment 6 month one- two year follow treatment condition . The null hypothesis assume . A within group analysis conduct order estimate effect size significant clinical change estimate . Participants randomize block 17 patient divide three condition 1:2 ratio . Two factor control randomization . First , gender , second number previous depressive episode ( DSM-IV , APA 1994 ) . A computer provide NTNU generate randomization list .</detailed_description>
