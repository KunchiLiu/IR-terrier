	<brief_summary>Over past decade , survival rate heart transplantation recipient improve significantly , due advancement regimens immunosuppressive surgical technique , still limit first 12 month post transplantation . Long-term survival remain almost unchanged indicate need identify improve relevant factor . Evidence chronically-ill patient population show healthcare system ( e.g . level chronic illness management ( CIM ) ) patient self-management ( e.g . adherence ) drive improvement outcomes . The BRIGHT study first multi-centre , multi-continental study examine healthcare system heart transplant centre chronic illness management practice pattern potential correlate immunosuppressive medication nonadherence . The knowledge gain inform clinician , researcher healthcare policy maker level ( ) intervention need implement improve long-term outcome transplant recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : After receive heart transplant ( HTx ) patient adhere number health behavior ( e.g. , medication taking , smoke cessation ) order guarantee optimal outcome . Non-adherence health behavior associate poor clinical economic outcome . However , prevalence non-adherence health behavior high among HTx recipient . Furthermore , difference prevalence among country continent observe . The extent HTx recipient adherent affect variety risk factor , namely 1 ) patient-related factor , 2 ) socioeconomic factor , 3 ) therapy-related factor , 4 ) health-related factor 5 ) healthcare system team factor . To-date , last group factor receive limited attention understand complex phenomena adherence . Aims : The aim study : 1 . To describe CIM practice pattern among centre , countries/continents HTx . 2 . To assess prevalence variability nonadherence treatment regimen , i.e . medication taking , smoke cessation , diet keep , alcohol consumption , physical activity , sun protection appointment keep HTx recipient among centre , countries/continents . 3 . To determine multi-level factor related immunosuppressive medication adherence different system level 4 . To benchmark participate centre , country continent relation CIM practice pattern non-adherence health behaviour Methodology : The BRIGHT study international , multi-center , cross-sectional study . Data collect use interview questionnaire . HTx recipient , nurse work post-transplantation care HTx recipients medical director HTx program survey . The investigator recruit convenience sample 36 heart transplantation center ( North America ( n= 12 ) , European ( n= 19 ) , Australia ( n= 2 ) South America ( n= 3 ) ) . Within participate center , random sample patient meet study eligibility criterion select . Per center , minimum 20 maximum 60 patient include . In total , 1677 heart transplant recipient invite participate study . The questionnaire use study exist questionnaire ( e.g . BAASIS interview ass adherence medication , DASS ass depression ) well questionnaires develop study . During regular follow-up visit , patient invited staff person participate study . The staff first inform patient study , patient willing participate , retrieve sign informed consent . Participating study voluntary . Informed consent nurse medical director transplant center imply complete questionnaire . Participant name hold strict confidence remain anonymous research report publication . The result benchmarking parameter assess study report figure table . Because privacy , HTx center identify parameter specific center . All information report anonymously .</detailed_description>
