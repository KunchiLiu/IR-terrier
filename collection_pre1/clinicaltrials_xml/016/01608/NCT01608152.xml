	<detailed_description>Feasibility Evaluation Phase : If agree take part study , meet study staff clinic visit . You receive instruction use video game internet . During game , complete many different `` real world '' task relate thing help recovery HSCT . You also able communicate compete participant study . You use computer play game one loan use study . You ask play game home 3 week . The number time play 3 week depend treatment schedule . You give contact information report problem question may study staff . You also call phone appointment doctor ask clinic visit problem question . Within 1 week 3-week period end , interview phone clinic visit . You ask like like game . If loan computer , return end study . This investigational study . Up 40 participant enrol study . Up 32 take part phase study . All enrol MD Anderson . Needs Analysis Phase : If agree take part study , take part focus group discussion . During discussion , ask question like dislike video game design researcher . The game design around task help recovery HSCT . You ask question feature might like see game think look like . The focus group session may last 1Â½ hour . The session may audiotaped researcher may take note session . Several week focus group session , ask return provide opinion document drawing researcher create game . This may do one-on-one small group session . This investigational study . Up 40 participant enrol study . Up 8 take part phase study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
