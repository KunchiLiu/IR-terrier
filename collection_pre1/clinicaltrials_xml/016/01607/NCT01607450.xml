	<brief_summary>The objective proposal provide quantitative dose-response data effect GLP-1 myocardial glucose uptake healthy control subject obese type 2 diabetic subject , support design later study evaluate therapeutic application GLP-1 heart disease . Aim 1 : To measure effect GLP-1 infusion myocardial fuel selection lean healthy human fast ( fatty acid-dominant ) condition . Four group 10 lean healthy subject study infusion 0 ( saline control ) , 0.5 , 1.5 , 4.0 pmol/kg/min GLP-1 ( one study per subject ) . Cardiac metabolism measure use PET , use dual-tracer approach allow measurement myocardial glucose uptake ( primary endpoint ) along total oxidation rate myocardial perfusion ( secondary endpoint ) . In concert measure circulate metabolite regulatory hormone , investigator produce comprehensive assessment action GLP-1 myocardial metabolism human date . Effects dose compare saline control , plus investigator combine data use nonlinear curve-fitting derive sensitivity ( ED50 ) maximal response GLP-1 effect myocardial glucose uptake . Aim 2 : To measure effect GLP-1 infusion myocardial fuel selection obese type 2 diabetic human fast ( fatty acid-dominant ) condition Four group 10 obese type 2 diabetic subject study infusion 0 , 0.5 , 1.5 , 4.0 pmol/kg/min GLP-1 Aim 1 . Analyses parallel describe Aim 1 . Results Aims 1 2 combine allow direct comparison dose-response nondiabetic control type 2 diabetic subject . No literature publish inform dose selection design clinical trial GLP-1 modulation heart fuel selection . With expertise experience PET measurement heart metabolism diabetes , investigator uniquely position fill gap knowledge . These study necessary preamble evaluation potential GLP-1 base treatment heart disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 1860 Lean subject define BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 , good general health , take regular medication Diabetic subject obese ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 &lt; 40 kg/m2 ) , HbA1c 7.010.0 % , treat diet exercise plus oral agent injected insulin . All diabetic subject treat injected insulin 2 week prior study , avoid potential confounding effect antidiabetic agent . Chronic illness infection ( type 2 diabetes ) Known coronary artery disease abnormal ECG screen evaluation Blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg two occasion screen evaluation . Current use 3 few blood pressure medication blood pressure cutpoint acceptable . Total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dL . Current use 2 few lipid lowering agent cholesterol cutpoint acceptable . Diabetic subject : Treatment GLP1 agonist DPP4 inhibitor within past 6 month Known intolerance inject GLP1 agonist Treatment PPAR gamma agonist currently within past 6 month Recognized microvascular complication ( retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy ) Unwillingness inability use injected insulin purpose study Chronic pain physical condition limit ability remain supine duration study protocol History claustrophobia , musculoskeletal factor would result inability comfortably remain within PET scanner gantry duration image protocol Occupational , investigational know radiation exposure , together plan radiologic study , result great 500 mrem total exposure contiguous 12 month period For female participant , current pregnancy</criteria>
