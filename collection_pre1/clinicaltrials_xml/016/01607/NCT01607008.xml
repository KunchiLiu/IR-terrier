	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer one common cancer America , affect 1 6 men . External beam radiation therapy one common method treat prostate cancer . Although radiotherapy effective , side effect adjacent normal organ limit therapeutic ratio . Those side effect usually associate radiation damage normal tissue surround prostate , e.g . bladder , urethra rectum etc . Both effectiveness side effect radiation treatment often accessed whole course radiotherapy , make early intervention difficult . The current research project feasibility study utilize advance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques access radiotherapy treatment response prostate cancer right radiotherapy . Many advanced MRI technique , e.g . spectroscopy ( MRS ) , diffusion-weighted ( DWI ) , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) perfusion weight image , use radiology department diagnostic purpose . This research project study feasibility use advanced MRI sequence monitor tissue response radiotherapy . The tissue change reveal MRI provide physicians early information possible tumor recurrence normal tissue toxicity , therefore , early intervention may possible spare normal tissue cure patient . The project design combine several different advance MRI image technique systematically study tissue change radiotherapy , see elsewhere date . Another important goal research project study feasibility associate functional MRI radiation treatment dose distribution . Tissue response radiation treatment depend dose . The functional MRI provide information simple anatomic information . Mapping functional MRI spatially associate 3D dose distribution radiation treatment planning system one important step quantitative ass relationship radiation treatment tissue change due radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Assessing Prostate Cancer Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patient diagnosed prostate cancer undergo external beam radiotherapy recruit study . Three MR scan patient study perform different time point . Each MR scan include several advanced MR imaging sequence ( include limit MR spectroscopy , diffusion perfusion imaging , use routine clinical radiology setting ) addition typical T1 T2 weight MR image . The MR scan conduct Radiation Oncology department position similar treatment position . The first MR scan happen prior radiation treatment schedule patient simulation baseline information . The T1- T2-weighted MRI use delineation prostate gland part routine treatment planning process . Additional functional MR ( DWI/ADC . DCE , etc ) image use baseline study . The second MR scan sequence happen mid course radiation treatment . And third MR scan sequence happen end radiation treatment . Because participated patient come radiation oncology department daily routine radiation treatment additional visit require patient . The first scan happen day patient undergo CT MRI simulation treatment plan part standard care . Two extra MRI scan perform part research protocol . The second third scan happen one treatment day . While anticipated advanced MRI technique eventually play important role early intervention radiation treatment patient management radiotherapy prostate cancer JHH , modification radiation treatment patient management base image information acquire feasibility study . All participate patient undergo routine radiation treatment prostate cancer patient manage department . The image data acquire systematically process analyze along correlate radiation treatment dose distribution . All MRI data three different scan need register register plan CT . The anatomical , functional change tumor normal tissue radiation treatment access correlate radiation dose . After radiotherapy , enrol patient follow way normal post treatment management . The short term long term tumor response normal tissue side effect also collect routine clinical follow . Following MRI base biomarker assess : - ADC map - Dynamic contrast imaging ( DCE ) - Spectroscopy - Other MRI modality develop For example , tumor size measurement , MRI parameter choline peak spectroscopy , ADC value , DCE map , tumor normal tissue dos record scan . A multi-parametric analysis perform seek correlation . A new software package develop help overlay functional MRI data top 3D radiation dose distribution . The region interest correlation MRI data dose easy identify use new software . Further detail quantitative analysis focus identified region interest . Data Analysis Steps : 1 . After first scan , dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI data process iCAD package get pharmacokinetic parameter e.g . Ktrans Ve.. A Ktrans v Ve map generate . All MRI data include T1 , T2 , ADC map , DEC map , spectroscopy resampled resolution register . The treatment target , prostate case , along surround normal organ ( rectum , urethral bladder ) delineate base anatomical MRI image . Within prostate gland , different part region , cancerous healthy region base functional MRI define . 2 . Second third set MRI scan data process way Step 1 register baseline scan . Same anatomical structure region within prostate define . 3 . To test Hypothesis one , MRI signal second third scan compare baseline scan individual MRI sequence data combine data multiparametric approach.The signal change within different organ different region prostate analyze . A statistical significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) signal intensity change within certain region interest define observation signal change . After kinetic MRI data analysis do independently without knowledge radiation dose , register MRI data import radiation treatment planning system . Some special software develop change MRI data format recognize format planning system . Within treatment planning system , MRI data co-registered planning CT . The 3D dose distribution overlap MRI data . The dosimetric information like maximum dose , mean dose organ region interest define previous step calculate . The dose parameter calculate stationary planning CT . There potential dose uncertainty due motion prostate rectum . However , give external beam radiotherapy prostate usually last 6-8 week many fractionate treatment image guide patient treatment ability clinic , systematic organ motion small . Besides , literature data dose dependent tumor control toxicity derive plan CT without consider organ motion . Therefore , consider effect organ motion use dose parameter stationary plan CT protocol . 4 . The correlation dosimetric parameter signal change analyze test Hypothesis two . 5 . Routine follow data tumor response ( e.g PSA value ) normal tissue toxicity assessment collect . Although limited sample size pilot study , direct link MRI signal change treatment outcome may obtain . Any information , trend gather correlation use design next phase study .</detailed_description>
