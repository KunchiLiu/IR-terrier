	<brief_summary>Leptospirosis zoonosis worldwide distribution whose incidence high tropic , condition transmission favorable . The disease endemic Martinique Guadeloupe , two Caribbean island French West Indies . In tropical area , many wild domestic animal serve reservoir pathogenic Leptospira strain contaminate environment shed organisms urine . Humans usually infect abraded skin mucous membrane contact water contaminate urine animal reservoir , less frequently direct contact animal urine . The mean incubation period 10 day , usual range 2-20 day . Clinical manifestation protean spectrum symptom range subclinical mild anicteric febrile illness acute renal failure respiratory distress syndrome associate high mortality rate . The microscopic agglutination test ( MAT ) culture reference standard test diagnosis leptospirosis , available reference laboratory conclusive result require convalescent sample prolonged incubation . At present , direct detection method use PCR might provide rapid diagnosis early acute stage illness , treatment likely great benefit . Quantitative PCR also offer ability measure level leptospiremia clinical sample . Using qPCR base diagnosis , investigator opportunity study association level leptospiremia clinical manifestation French West Indies . All qPCR-positive sample use molecular typing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Principal objective To determine leptospiral bacterial load associate severe evolution disease ( organ failure , internal bleeding , death ) French West Indies . Secondary objective 1 . To identify demographic , clinical , biological , bacteriological , genetic factor ( HLA ) associate severe complication leptospirosis ( organ failure , internal bleeding , death ) . 2 . To identify demographic , clinical , biological , bacteriological , genetic factor ( HLA ) associate altered quality life acute phase leptospirosis . 3 . To collect human biological sample allow study individual susceptibility infection ( genetic polymorphism , HLA ) .</detailed_description>
