	<brief_summary>The study describe protocol perform within framework PROTECT ( Pharmacoepidemiological Research Outcomes Therapeutics European ConsorTium ) Workpackage 2 Workgroup 1 . Primary aim study develop , test disseminate methodological standard design , conduct analysis Pharmacoepidemiological ( PE ) study applicable different safety issue use different data source . To achieve , result PE study five key adverse event ( AEs ) perform different database evaluate . Therefore , emphasis methodological aspect study protocol clinical consequence association investigation . In present project , investigator use Columbia Classification Algorithm suicide assessment ( C-CASA ) definition basis specify operational definition different aspect suicidality . The focus main analysis attempt suicide include complete suicide . This due statistical power issue . However , investigator apply two additional outcome definition sensitivity analyse : 1 ) complete suicide 2 ) complete suicide , suicide attempt , preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior , suicidal ideation plus indeterminate potentially suicidal event . Investigators include term clearly indicate accidental event , self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent . These definition list statistical analysis plan together list term dictionary use different database . The objective study 1 ) Compare study result base two data source ( UK General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) Danish registry ) different design evaluate impact design population difference outcome study result ( UK database 'The Health Improvement Network ' ( THIN ) may include analysis well ) ; 2 ) Evaluate strengths weakness two data source study possible association antiepileptic drug ( AED ) use suicidality , particular specific outcome death suicide , hospitalization due suicide attempt , report aspect suicidality patient ; 3 ) Estimate risk complete suicide , complete suicide attempt suicide , complete suicide , suicide attempt , preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior , suicidal ideation plus indeterminate potentially suicidal event overall AEDs individual AEDs prescribe UK Denmark ; 4 ) Describe pattern AED prescribe six European database ( GPRD THIN , UK ; Danish registry ; Mondriaan , Netherlands ; Bavaria , Germany ; Base de Datos para la Investigaci√≥n Farmacoepidemiologica en Atencion Primaria ( BIFAP ) , Spain ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Suicide major public heath concern . The estimated global burden suicide million death per year . Self-inflicted death account 1.5 % death tenth lead cause death worldwide . Compiling evidence suicidality fraught problem . E.g . suicide death generally perceive underreported prone misclassification cause-of-death ascertainment procedure . The suicide rate may underestimate 10 % 22 % . The reliability suicidality record electronic database recently study . Arana et al investigated data United Kingdom database THIN find code algorithm use identify suicidality high predictive value ( 97 % ) . The positive predictive value complete suicide low ( 88 % ) 14 % 'true ' , complete suicide identify die . Hall validation study death suicide record database identify seven case suicide 1394 'true death ' ( 0.5 % ) . One record 'suicide ' Read code , second case identify 'hanging ' comment section , third probable suicide case Read term 'overdose drug ' plus additional comment 'paracetamol/propaxyphene ' , four remain case identify external document death certificate . Hall exclude patient 'major emotional event ' history cancer . This may one reason percentage suicide death low expect ( 0.5 % versus 1.5 % ) mention . Antiepileptic medication heterogeneous pharmacologic class characterize various chemical structure postulate mechanisms action . The main therapeutic application antiepileptic include epilepsy , bipolar disorder , depression , neuralgia , migraine . AEDs among commonly prescribe centrally active agent . In survey , carry Danish County , 1.1 % studied people receive AEDs . The use drug increase increase age . Patients mention indication epilepsy , major depression , bipolar disorder higher risk suicide compare general population . A possible association antiepileptic drug suicidality study use different data source UK GPRD , UK THIN , US HealthCore Integrated Research Database ( HIRD ) , Danish patient registry , Swedish patient registry , data clinical trial . The investigator apply different study design cohort , match case-control , case-crossover study well meta-analysis . The published effect antiepileptic drug suicidality cover range odds ratio ( OR ) 0.24 ( 95 % CI : 0.03-2.17 ) pregabalin OR 6.42 ( 95 % CI : 1.24-33.36 ) levetiracetam . The effect individual AEDs differ considerably within study study . The hold different indication . Arana et al find low OR patient epilepsy ( OR 0.59 ; 95 % CI : 0.35 - 0.98 ) high OR patient depression ( OR 1.65 ; 95 % CI : 1.24 - 2.19 ) . The author compare current use AEDs use AEDs different indication . Due complexity present issue , adequate adjustment numerous potential confounders socioeconomic aspect , various comorbidities , concomitantly prescribe medication , analytic challenge . Further , availability sufficiently large number patient investigation another issue .</detailed_description>
