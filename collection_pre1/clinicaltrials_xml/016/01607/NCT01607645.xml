	<brief_summary>The goal study learn effectiveness , side-effects , wait give idarubicin cytarabine may change side effect effectiveness , identify factor predict response therapy . The trial examine combination three chemotherapy drug . These drug decitabine , idarubicin , cytarabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Followed Idarubicin Cytarabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory AML MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine morphologic complete remission ( CR ) rate use decitabine ( DAC ) -priming follow idarubicin ( IDA ) cytarabine ( ARAC ) patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine CR without minimal residual disease ( CRMRD- ) , CR incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) , CR minimal residual disease ( CRMRD+ ) , CR incomplete blood count recovery minimal residual disease ( CRiMRD+ ) rate . II . To estimate frequency severity regimen-related toxicity . III . To identify biomarkers ( e.g. , deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] methylation expression change include interferon regulatory factor [ IRF ] 8 ) associate clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -4 0 , cytarabine IV continuously 24 hour day 1-7 , idarubicin IV 10-15 minute day 1-3 . ARM II : Patients receive decitabine IV 1 hour day -9 -5 cytarabine idarubicin Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
