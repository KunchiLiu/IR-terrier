	<brief_summary>The common benign tumor parotid gland call pleomorphic adenoma . Although benign , tumor may recur surgical removal due tumor cell leave behind surgical operation . Thus , pleomorphic adenoma treat wide resection similar malignant tumor . This extensive surgery often lead injury motor nerve responsible facial expression eye protection . The investigator propose less extensive surgery thorough enough prevent tumor recurrence keep facial nerve risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quadrant Versus Superficial Parotidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pleomorphic adenoma notorious propensity local recurrence due microscopic extracapsular extension tumor . Superficial parotidectomy ( SP ) standard treatment . Extracapsular dissection ( ED ) propose minimize risk facial nerve palsy . However , oncologic safety ED controversial literature . We propose quadrant parotidectomy ( QP ) less radical SP less conservative ED . QP entail dissection overlie one primary division facial nerve leave division undisturbed resection safety margin still generous . Surgery pleomorphic adenoma compromise radicality facial nerve morbidity . Risk local recurrence imprecisely described literature universally regard infrequent remote . Many study report recurrent case . Thus , Facial nerve injury main concern parotid surgeon consider primary end point study .</detailed_description>
