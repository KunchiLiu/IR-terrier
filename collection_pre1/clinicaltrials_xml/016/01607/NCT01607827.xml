	<brief_summary>The investigator aim assess procedure time miss rate polyp perform polypectomy colon way up* down** way down** . ( * advance scope cecum , ** pull back scope intubation cecum ) . Our hypothesis use strategy remove visible polyp firstly way secondly way less time consume miss less polyps strategy remove polyps way .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colorectal Polypectomy Upon Insertion And Withdrawal Or Upon Withdrawal Only ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referral complete colonoscopy include study . Polyps remove upon insertion withdrawal colonoscope Group A upon withdrawal instrument Group B accord computer-generated randomization list . The following inclusion criterion use : referral complete colonoscopy age 18 year old . All patient polyps detect colonoscopy include . In order compare time require entire endoscopy two treatment group , include patient polyps 10 mm diameter . The following exclusion criterion apply : colonoscopy due bleeding , high likelihood colonic stenosis severe inflammation , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , hereditary colonic polyp disease ( FAP HNPCC ) , contraindication polypectomy , coagulopathy , use anti-clotting medication ( anticoagulation , high-dose heparin aspirin , NSAIDs ) , polyps &gt; 10 mm diameter ( remove biopsy channel remove basket polyp grasper ; use device necessitates removal consecutive re-insertion endoscope , make comparison time interval two group impossible ) , suboptimal bowel preparation ( presence significant amount fecal remnant could remove flush colon colonoscope allow clear visualization mucosa ) , miss sign informed consent form . The randomization do soon first polyp detect . When polyp detect , case regard screening failure exclude study . Randomization perform follow two group : Group A : Removal visible polyp upon insertion withdrawal instrument Group B : Removal visible polyp upon withdrawal colonoscope One day colonoscopy , patient ask complete questionnaire evaluate tolerance ileo-colonoscopy ( visual scale 1 4 1 stand discomfort , 2 minor discomfort , 3 moderate discomfort , 4 severe discomfort associate endoscopy ) . Endoscopic procedure : Colon preparation perform use 3 liter PEG-based standard lavage fluid ( Fordtran Streuli Â® , Streuli Pharma , Switzerland ) . The procedure perform senior endoscopists ( SW , SRV , HF , NW , PB ) least 5 year experience colonoscopy perform least 200 colonoscopy per year . All endoscopists participate trial underwent specific study training head SW. Polyp size measure use open biopsy forceps ( Boston Scientific Radial JawTM 4 , Reference No 1332 , diameter open jaw 9mm ) . All endoscopists comparable number procedure approach polypectomy . Premedication consist mostly propofol ( 60-400 mg ) combination midazolam ( 2.5-5 mg ) and/or meperidine ( 25-50 mg ) intravenously . Examinations perform left lateral decubitus supine position . Colonic insufflation perform room air . All polypectomy study group perform use technique standard care non-study patient , use snare loop , hot biopsy forceps , without submucosal injection saline/epinephrine . Polyps large 3 mm remove snare , polyps small 4 mm remove cold biopsy . There differences upon insertion withdrawal . In Group A , endoscopist remove visible polyp instantly regardless whether advance instrument cecum pull back . In Group B , endoscopist advance endoscope cecum without remove polyp . Upon withdrawal , visible polyp remove successively standard technique . In group , endoscopists instruct focus rapid introduction . Assessments After endoscopy , physician complete data capture sheet evaluate follow criterion : patient demographic , patient history , time interval require procedure , number polyp detect upon insertion , number polyp remove upon insertion , number polyp remove upon withdrawal , overall technical ease ( score 1 4 1 stand technical problem , 2 minor , 3 moderate , 4 major technical difficulty ) , presence technical problem ( difficult visualization polyp , difficult removal polyp , difficult retrieval polyp , answer categorically `` Yes '' `` No '' ) , patient tolerance ( complete patient ) , characterization every polyp ( location , size , time removal additional comment ) .</detailed_description>
