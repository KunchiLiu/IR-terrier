	<detailed_description>Approximately 550,000 baby bear prematurely year United States suffer birth time development respiratory tract immune system would normally protect maintain na√Øve state . This project component NIH Prematurity Respiratory Outcomes Program ( PROP ) whose goal identification disease mechanism biomarkers stratify premature infant , time discharge , risk subsequent pulmonary morbidity . This Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) project investigate prematurity-dependent alteration cellular innate adaptive immune system result increased susceptibility respiratory infection environmental irritant , lead respiratory morbidity first year life . Prior study establish developmental ( maturity ) disease-related change circulate pulmonary lymphocyte population comprehensive assessment relationship disease risk/outcome undertaken . We hypothesize cellular molecular immuno-maturity alter due intrinsic extrinsic factor present premature birth way reduce resistance viral infection promote cytotoxic damage lung . We evaluate immunologic maturity comprehensively phenotyping lymphocyte population peripheral blood sample premature delivery , time discharge hospital twelve month correct age . The lymphocytic phenotype analyze particularly context gestational age maternal-fetal stressor capable modulate oxidative stress ( oxygen exposure , infection environmental tobacco smoke exposure ) . Additionally , assess change molecular phenotype isolate CD8 lymphocyte , cell type preferentially recruit lung premature infant capable contribute disease pathogenesis , genome-wide expression profiling , order uncover novel disease pathway define gene expression signature associate disease risk . Finally , propose build statistical model , use cellular molecular phenotype additional clinical variable , stratify risk lung morbidity within first year life .</detailed_description>
