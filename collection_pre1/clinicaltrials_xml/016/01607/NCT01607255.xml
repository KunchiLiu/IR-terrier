	<brief_summary>Adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) quality indicator colonoscopy perform colorectal cancer screening . Population study show traditional air colonoscopy fail eliminate post screen colonoscopy cancer cancer mortality proximal colon . The investigator aim establish superior effectiveness combine chromoendoscopy water exchange method detect proximal diminutive adenoma screen colonoscopy sedate Veterans . An improved adenoma detection rate associate optical colonoscopy minimize risk miss lesion . The improvement may translate remedy limitation screen colonoscopy proximal colon , e.g . high adenoma detection rate may minimize burden post screen colonoscopy interval colorectal cancer among veteran population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Design : Prospective , single center , patient blind , randomize control trial 2 . Methods : Colonoscopy traditional air insufflation , water exchange water exchange plus indigocarmine aid insertion colonoscope ; split dose bowel preparation ; patient receive sedation ; assessment serum electrolyte level colonoscopy 1 . Control method : Traditional air insufflation method . 2 . Study method : - Water exchange method . - Water method combine chromoendoscopy ( 0.008 % indigo carmine ) . 3 . Population study Veterans age 50 75 refer first time screen colonoscopy 4 . Unit ( ) analysis 1 . Primary outcome : overall adenoma detection rate . 2 . Secondary outcome : patient demographic variable procedure relate measure . 5 . Sampling strategy : Veterans refer screen colonoscopy offer enrollment study . 1 . Sample size calculation . A total 480 subject recruit randomize 160 group . 5 . Subject recruitment : patient refer screen colonoscopy come three source . 6 . Description base population group study method randomization . Veterans age 50 75 refer first time screen colonoscopy . After informed consent , assignment control study arm base computer generate random number code store pre-arranged opaque envelope .</detailed_description>
