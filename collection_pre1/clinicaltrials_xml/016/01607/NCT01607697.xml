	<brief_summary>Scientific Abstract : The investigator propose study examine impact Mindfulness Based Intervention ( MBI ) quality life Non-Motor Symptoms ( NMS ) persons Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . NMS add significantly disease burden negatively impact quality life PD ( 1,2 ) . In previous study investigator confirm high prevalence NMS PD patient either early- late-onset disease ( 3 ) . Despite currently available treatment , PD lead worsen disability remain need new approach . A Mindfulness Based Intervention may provide important adjuvant therapy treatment PD relation NMS quality life . A minimum 100 patient randomly assign MBI 'Treatment As Usual ' ( TAU ) group . Clinical assessment ( motor non-motor score ) perform group . The TAU group offer MBI completion study . To best knowledge , first large scale study use MBI indication .</brief_summary>
