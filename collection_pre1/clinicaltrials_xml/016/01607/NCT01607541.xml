	<detailed_description>Approximately 21 % HIV infection U.S. undiagnosed , 40 % adult test . Thus , late diagnosis HIV common , , furthermore , treatment delay disruption widespread . Heterosexuals high risk ( HHR ) significantly less likely test HIV , likely diagnose HIV late , experience serious barrier enter care compare group . Our research team study HHR New York City ( NYC ) part CDC 's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance ( NHBS ) study . The investigator find HIV prevalence rate 7.4 % among HHR NYC , 6 % infection previously diagnose . Further , central Brooklyn , 10 % newly diagnose HIV . The propose study use NHBS methodology target HHR . Reduced rate HIV test treatment among HHR due structural ( e.g. , poor access ) , social ( e.g. , peer norm ) , individual-level ( e.g. , low perceive risk ) barrier . Thus active recruitment approach model NHBS need overcome structural barrier , peer-delivered intervention effectively reduce individual social barrier test treatment . The primary goal propose study evaluate efficacy multi-level enhance peer-driven intervention ( PDI ) seek , test , treat retain HHR . The enhanced PDI tailor specifically HHR include computerize , navigation , peer-delivered component enhance future sustainability . The design intervention guide Theories Triadic Influence Normative Regulation . Similar NHBS , enhance PDI use respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) . NHBS protocols use venue-based sampling ( VBS ) RDS reach population high risk . However , VBS RDS yet directly compare term yield undiagnosed HIV infection . Thus specific aim five-year propose study : ( 1 ) compare yield efficiency RDS VBS identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR ; ( 2 ) measure efficacy enhance PDI compare control term time HIV care HAART initiation , viral load suppression , retention among newly-diagnosed ; ( 3 ) examine whether effect PDI HIV health/treatment outcomes mediate change individual ( e.g. , perceive risk ) , social ( e.g. , peer norm ) , structural influence ( e.g. , enhance access ) , and/or whether factor ( e.g. , substance use ) moderate effect ; ( 4 ) project cost cost-effectiveness RDS vs. VBS PDI . The investigator conduct enhance PDI ( N=3000 ) central Brooklyn , location hyperendemic HIV HHR experience poor access test treatment . Simultaneously , VBS ( N=400 ) undertaken central Brooklyn . The propose study complement local national HIV prevention initiative design contribute efficient , innovative , sustainable multi-level recruitment approach intervention HIV prevention portfolio . The vast majority HHR African-American Latino ; therefore propose study may also impact racial/ethnic disparity HIV/AIDS . The study 's main hypothesis follow : ( H1 ) : Compared venue-based sampling ( VBS ) , control potential difference key sociodemographic characteristic across sample , participant recruit respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) likely test positive HIV first time . H2 ) : Participants Test Treat Phase BCAP PDI 's intervention arm ( HIV-infected ) evidence short time HIV clinical appointment , short time initiate HAART ( medically indicate ) , high rate viral load suppression , high rate retention care compare control arm .</detailed_description>
