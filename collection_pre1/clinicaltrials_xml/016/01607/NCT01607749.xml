	<brief_summary>Undertake study educational intervention primary school Andalusia HYPOTHESIS : There difference quality life associate asthma ( measure questionnaire PAQLQ ) level asthma control student asthma age 11 12 year receive educational intervention peer without asthma versus receive standard information school . OBJECTIVES : To compare control asthma symptom , quality life asthma asthma knowledge among group receive educational intervention deliver specialist teacher physical education ( MEEF ) Primary Schools ( CEIP ) control . MÉTODOS group : Randomized control single-blind . POPULATION : Students 11 12 year old Andalusia Sample size : 258 child / child asthma mean contrast ( alpha error 3.4 % . 80 % power , confidence level 95 % consider 20 % loss . 2580 student enrol prevalence asthma 10 % ) . Conglomerates CEIP urban , rural , public private-reached . INTERVENTION : Training MEEF educational program `` Sports Health Asthma subsequent delivery , student MEEF 5th 6th grade ( 3 session ) . CONTROL : The standard instruction school . OUTCOME VARIABLES : Quality life ( Juniper ) `` control del asthma en niños '' ( CAN ) asthmatic , Knowledge ( NAKQ questionnaire ) attitudes toward asthma ( student teacher ) . Pre-intervention ( T0 ) , post-intervention 5-6 month ( T1 ) Independent variable : Sex , suffer asthma , intervention / control , type CEIP . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Comparison continuous variable : T Students ( If normal distribution ) `` Mann-Whitney ( If non-normal distribution ) . To study qualitative variable chi-square test ( normal distribution ) Kruskal-Wallis ( no-normal distribution ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN . Single-blind clinical trial random allocation group receive educational intervention control group , develop throughout school year ( September 2011 May 2012 ) . The unit randomization school avoid intracenter contamination student educational intervention . The unit analysis student school FIELD OF STUDY . Students age 10 13 year old attending school Primary Education ( CEIP ) Andalusia , world population 38,829 student total 728 CEIP . The school recruit AVERROES tool Ministry Education Andalusia Sample size : To achieve power 90.0 % detect difference contrast null hypothesis H ₀ : μ ₀ = μ ₀ t-Student test bilaterally two independent sample , consider significance level 5 % , assume mean difference quality life questionnaire group 0.5 common standard deviation 1.10 unit , estimate loss 15 % necessary include 129 unit experimental group Reference 129 unit Experimental group , total 258 experimental unit study . Since prevalence asthma approximately 10 % population , need include total 2580 student , total 258 student asthma student student without asthma get outcome measure compare average asthma knowledge attitude asthma student involve study teach center . INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE : CEIP choose randomization computer , offer participate . One researcher contact director teacher Physical Education ( MEF ) sit , explain purpose study . Upon acceptance participate , seek approval School Councils inform parent student study , request consent child 's participation trial . ASSIGNMENT randomly two group : The allocation 1:1 control group intervention group , school stratification public / private rural / urban , number student enrol school invited participate . ( Annex 1 ) As post randomisation loss , estimate 15 % , attend educational session 3 analysis intention treat per protocol . In subject lose follow reach , apply complete study questionnaire PAQLQ ACT determine degree asthma control quality life completion course . Randomization intervention control center shall make avoid contamination control intervention occur within single center . Blinding : The research team train use educational package MEF different group researcher collect questionnaire , questionnaire correction make without know group assign student therefore know type intervention CES . Teachers student intervention control group examine content curriculum another comparison group . The researcher conduct statistical treatment , know assignment experimental control center key identification . The Principal Investigator know allocation control experimental group Intervention : Schools intervention group receive educational program `` Asthma , Sport Health '' 23 , validate grupo24 taught within curriculum CEIP approve school board center . This program taught student three lesson equipment design develop research group teach within curriculum CEIP . The content class method work detailed educational program . However offer framework Annex 2 . Teachers physical education specialist responsible project center receive training curriculum use training seminar school day researcher health group . Once familiar educational package three session teach student fellow faculty ( different day teacher student ) within 15-30 day . CONTROL : The control group provide information asthma supply Ministry Education school community . STUDY VARIABLES : For main hypothesis `` An intervention educational program student , without asthma primary school improve quality life associate asthma ( measure questionnaire PQALQ ) level asthma control ( measure questionnaire ACT ) student asthma , `` study variable : • Dependent variable ( primary ) : - Level quality life achieve following : ( PAQLQ ) . Quantitative value range 1 7 . The minimal clinically important difference 0.5 point . - The level asthma control achieve follow-up . `` control del asthma en niños '' ( CAN ) asthmatic : Quantitative value range 5 25 . The minimal clinically important difference 3.7 point . - Dependent Variable ( secondary objective ) - Knowledge asthma questionnaire NAKQ . Quantitative value range 0 31 . - Attitudes towards asthma among teacher student , intervention control . We use questionnaire base model include multiple domain ( internal control , tolerance asthma , chance external control ) detail ANNEX 5 . Is fill follow Liker scale 1 6 strongly agree strongly disagree . - Measures protect asthmatic apply primary school educational intervention student faculty obtain researcher school . Quantitative value range 0 20 ( ANNEX 7 ) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS : 1 . Quality Life Questionnaire child asthma-version standardized activity ( PAQLQ ( S ) E. Juniper , validate Spanish . ( Consists 23 item value poorer quality life 1 , best value 7 per item , average together ) APPENDIX 3 2 . Control asthma ( ACT ) . Annex 4 3. asthma knowledge questionnaire use asthma knowledge questionnaire Newcastle , whose linguistic validation conduct group approve original author . ANNEX 5 . This questionnaire maximum score 31 , range possible value 0-31 . 4 . Survey attitudes asthma . We use questionnaire base model include multiple domain ( internal control , tolerance asthma , chance external control ) detail ANNEX 6 . Is fill follow Liker scale 1 6 strongly agree strongly disagree . 5 . Resource Questionnaire Asthma School ( Annex 7 ) 6 . Data Sheet student authorization treatment case crisis . Baseline questionnaire use measure monitoring quality life , asthma control , attitude asthma knowledge questionnaire asthma asthma Resources CES . The questionnaire obtain surgery ( T0 ) , 6 month ( T1 ) check duration change obtain intervention . DATA ANALYSIS : At baseline , intergroup comparison ( intervention control ) qualitative variable use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test necessary . Quantitative variable follow normal distribution ( Shapiro Wilks test ) analyze Student 's t-or Mann-Whitney , respectively . In mean intragroup comparison ( intervention control ) repeat throughout study , apply Student t-test related sample Wilcoxon event non-normality . To compare mean 2 study group follow-up use repeat measure ANOVA assumption normality assumption non-normality group discus change Wilcoxon test . The analysis perform use SPSS-V18 . Analysis intention treat : They take account result group initially assign , regardless intervention , meet program 's effectiveness real condition . There also per protocol analysis determine effectiveness program ideal condition . DIFFICULTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY : 1 . Selection bias . In case child asthma include study child may asthma , refusal know disease diagnose many case recognize euphemistic term . Randomization could solve problem intervention control 2 . Losses . - Refusal parent patient select participate study . - Lack cooperation throughout study faculty / student . - We choose large enough sample study lack statistical power . - provide loss entire study first randomization sample universe . - Change school student belongs . 3 ) You may bias awareness subject include study mere fact know observe strict consequence educational intervention . Random assignment intervention control group minimize influence . 4 ) Intervention study train activity , increase level knowledge pathology address , always produce positive change attitude aim control disease . ethical 1 .
