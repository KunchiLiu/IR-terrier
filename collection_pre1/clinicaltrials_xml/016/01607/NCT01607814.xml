Moreover , treatment use increase platelet count modulate platelet function could potentially harm . Consequently optimal management bleeding complication still matter discussion . Moreover , last two decade increase recognition bleeding also thrombosis complicate clinical course cirrhosis . Over last year , emerge vivo platelet function coagulation cascade might modulate alteration pro-oxidant antioxidant balance .

	<detailed_description>Natural history cirrhotic patient complicate gastrointestinal bleeding remain dramatic event consider acute onset negative impact life expectancy LC patient . Over last decade , improvement therapy produce sensible reduction mortality least 20 % 6 week ( 8 % 24 hour ) one episode gastrointestinal bleeding . Furthermore , portal vein thrombosis ( PVT ) frequent ( 10-20 % ) event liver cirrhosis ( LC ) , often asymptomatic , may worsen clinical course favour gastrointestinal bleeding , particular precipitate grade portal hypertension . Standing coexistence thrombotic bleeding manifestation difficult interpretation management , elucidation mechanism lead complex hemostatic disturbance occur LC , would help u explore new therapeutic strategy prevent bleed improve clinical outcome . However mechanisms underlie specific cirrhotic hemostatic disturbance still unclear . On last decade , investigate presence abnormality hemostatic phase primary haemostasis ( altered platelet function ) fibrinolysis coagulation ( impaired synthesis activity coagulation factor hyperfibrinolysis. ) . The derangement coagulation balance investigate several study identify abnormal haemostasis test coagulation factor useful prognostic index survival LC patient Observational study show Factor VII , vitamin k dependent short half-life ( 2 hour ) useful prognostic index acute chronic liver insufficiency . Less well study interesting potential role primary haemostasis determination typical thrombotic bleeding complications.. It well know chronic liver disease characterize variable thrombocytopenia thrombocytopathy Observational study point platelet dysfunction abnormality occur prevalently severe liver failure . Child-Pugh C class patient present low platelet count prolong bleed time . Since platelet abnormality much frequent depend liver insufficiency severity , probably several mechanism account complex platelet dysfunction . A retrospective study 3 year follow- demonstrate strong association previous gastrointestinal hemorrhage , prolong bleeding time ( &gt; 10 minute ) low platelet count ( &lt; 100.000/ μl ) without explain relationship casual one . These data indicate LC patient history gastrointestinal blood loss thrombocytopenia or/and thrombocytopathy might determinant acute phase bleeding . However , moment , study LC patient prospectively analyze platelet function role favor hemorrhage activity still available . Several hypothesis propose explain mechanism lead platelet abnormal function LC patient , however , nature clinical significance still matter discussion . For example , debate whether platelet activity influence positively negatively manner LC patient . From literature emerge agreement mechanism lead in-vivo platelet aggregation patient affect chronic liver disease . Laffi et al . suggest cirrhotic patient defective aggregation likely dependent alteration transmembrane signal pathway increase urinary excretion systemic TXA2 metabolite may relate increase intrasplenic platelet destruction . On contrary , Davì et al . find significant correlation urinary excretion 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) plasma prothrombin fragment 1+2 ( F1+2 ) , suggest clot activation could partly account vivo platelet activation . Moreover , increase soluble P-selectin level , vivo marker platelet activation , find patient chronic C hepatitis correlate severity disease . These finding support hypothesis thrombocytopenia relate autoimmunity mechanism also condition vivo platelet activation induce directly HCV infection . Over last year , emerge vivo platelet function might modulate alteration pro-oxidant antioxidant balance . F ( 2 ) -isoprostanes prostaglandin F2-like compound produce vivo nonenzymatic free radical-induced peroxidation arachidonic acid COX-independent manner . Unlike lipid hydroperoxides , F2-IsoPs also specific product free radical-induced lipid peroxidation , chemically stable compound detectable plasma urine . One F2-IsoPs , show interestingly induce platelet aggregation stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation . The 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a measurement represent sensible specific index lipid peroxidation . It previously demonstrate chronic liver disease characterize increased ROS production well decreased activity antioxidant system , result oxidative stress . Hepatic fibrosis represent wound heal response injury ultimately lead cirrhosis . Mechanisms involve still investigation . Experimental human study show marker oxidative stress proinflammatory cytokine , increase liver disease suggest inflammation could pivotal role term progression chronic damage . NADPH oxidase complex recognize critical mediator liver fibrosis unexplored probably role modulate platelet function cirrhotic setting . To investigate relationship platelet , coagulation parameter oxidative stress cirrhotic patient , investigator plan cross-sectional study finalize clarify platelet , haemostatic balance oxidative stress contribution thrombotic bleeding complication occur cirrhosis 's natural history , identify new haemostatic parameter predictive value cirrhotic evolution mortality .</detailed_description>
