	<brief_summary>This study HMB plus amino acid old men prostate cancer start androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . The investigator hypothesize use nutritional supplementation decrease loss muscle mass strength occur men start ADT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate Counteract Muscle Loss Men With Prostate Cancer Androgen Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well establish old patient experience age-related loss muscle mass function ( sarcopenia ) , presumably due imbalance protein synthesis versus protein breakdown . In addition , study show men start ADT experience increase muscle protein breakdown decrease synthesis . β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) , leucine metabolite , show slow protein breakdown . When HMB give arginine lysine ( support protein synthesis ) randomize trial , researcher show elderly men woman receive nutritional supplementation experience improvement fat-free mass , strength , functionality protein synthesis compare control . In addition , patient advance cancer experience weight loss least 5 % also show benefit HMB , supplementation result significant increase fat-free mass compare control . Thus , seem reasonable old men prostate cancer start ADT experience lean muscle loss result age ADT , may achieve benefit supplementation HMB well . Use HMB men prostate cancer report .</detailed_description>
