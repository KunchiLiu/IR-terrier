	<brief_summary>This multicentre , open label study examine effect ezogabine/retigabine void function adult subject drug-resistant partial onset seizure ( POS ) . Subjects fulfil study entry criterion Screening Baseline include comprehensive eye examination ophthalmologist retina specialist skin assessment investigator receive ezogabine/retigabine . The start dose ezogabine/retigabine 300 mg/day . Subjects titrate 150 mg/day weekly maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose 1200 mg ( high tolerate dose ) . During 49 day treatment phase , subject undergo three repeat non-invasive assessment void function . In addition , subject meet pre-determined criterion void dysfunction undergo multichannel cystometry order characterise bladder hypocontractility , bladder outlet obstruction combination event clinically manifest difficulty empty bladder acute urinary retention . At end Treatment Phase , subject enter Taper Phase , 3-week titration period . Subjects new finding abnormal pigmentation retina , unexplained vision loss , pigmentation non-retinal ocular tissue discoloration skin , lip , nail , mucosa since baseline ask enter Safety Follow-Up / Continuation Phase . All subject undergo 6-monthly comprehensive eye examination Safety Follow-Up / Continuation Phase . Subjects develop abnormal discoloration skin , lip , nail mucosa continue undergo skin assessment investigator . Any subject develop abnormal discoloration skin , lip , nail mucosa since baseline refer dermatologist evaluation 6-monthly follow assessment . All subject continue follow pigmentation and/or discoloration resolve stabilise , define change 2 consecutive 6-monthly assessment conduct least 12 month discontinuation ezogabine/retigabine .</brief_summary>
