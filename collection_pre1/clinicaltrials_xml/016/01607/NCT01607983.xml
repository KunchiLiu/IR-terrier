	<brief_summary>The study involve document effect inhale nitric oxide upon ventricular-arterial coupling patient congenital heart disease passive pulmonary blood flow . Consenting patient undergo clinically-indicated cardiac catheterization give inhaled nitric oxide 10 minute intraventricular pressure-volume analysis make via conduction catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Pulmonary Vasodilation Upon VA Coupling Fontan Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients complex congenital heart disease single ventricle physiology typically undergo stag surgical palliation situation single ventricle recruit systemic pumping chamber ( follow Glenn surgery ) ( follow Fontan surgery ) systemic venous return flow passively lung . While physiology eliminates ventricular volume load normalizes systemic arterial oxygen saturation , remain number physiologic burden limit functional capacity life expectancy . Evidence suggest surgical imposition systemic pulmonary vascular bed series result ventricular loading condition adversely affect ventricular function . At present , exist limited mean mitigate burden , however , new therapy direct reduce total pulmonary resistance may favorably affect patient physiology reduce systemic venous pressure improve ventricular preload afterload . One therapy inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) , selective pulmonary vasodilator show reduce total pulmonary resistance improve systemic venous pressure patient population . However limited data exist regard affect pulmonary vasodilator like iNO ventricular load ventricular-arterial coupling . This study propose assess effect pulmonary vasodilator therapy upon ventricular load ventricular-arterial couple single ventricle patient passive pulmonary blood flow present elective cardiac catheterization . The study component include obtain routine ( would obtain part clinically-indicated catheterization ) hemodynamic measurement hi-fidelity catheter rather standard fluid-filled catheter , well simultaneous additional measurement catheter rest administration iNO .</detailed_description>
