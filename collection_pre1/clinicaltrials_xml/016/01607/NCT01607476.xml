	<brief_summary>The intent research protocol test equivalency two amyloid image drug ( C11 Pittsburgh Compound B F18 Flutemetamol ) . The investigator hypothesize significant difference distribution agent area amyloid deposition brain normal brain structure . Recent data show similarity distribution drug subject Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . No comparison data two PET drug normal subject publish . It important understand difference image biodistribution two drug normal subject nonspecific accumulation drug brain structure white matter appear differ slightly could affect image performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some current thinking regard pathophysiology AD involve production amyloid Beta protein ( AB ) secretase process amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) . While AB think toxic neuron role lead AD pathogenesis , without debate . In case , appear AB form amyloid plaque largely ubiquitous AD . Neuronal cell death result disease another clear pathophysiologic finding . Because importance finding development AD , target therapy investigate selectively inhibit AB production and/or manipulate amyloid load . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) molecular image modality use noninvasively measure functional process body . A trace amount radiopharmaceutical inject patient radiopharmaceutical take localized body function certain biological process . The detector PET scanner measure radiopharmaceutical distribution externally reconstruct PET image represent true distribution radiopharmaceutical within body .</detailed_description>
