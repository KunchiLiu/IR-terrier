	<detailed_description>The investigator study dietary supplement call anatabine purpose study make lozenge name RCP006 . Anatabine , active ingredient RCP006 , occur throughout world human food chain . Anatabine human food supply human use century . Humans expose anatabine tobacco product common widely consume food crop potato , pepper , eggplant tomato . The main purpose study evaluate effect dietary supplement normal human inflammatory function . Compounds chemically similar anatabine show reduce inflammatory response , laboratory study show anti-inflammatory property anatabine . The investigator want explore human study see anatabine maintain normal level inflammatory function . The investigator see effect easily investigator look effect anatabine volunteer marker high level inflammation begin . The investigator anticipate anatabine reduce marker inflammation . To look inflammation investigator test blood level protein call C-reactive protein . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) protein find blood , level rise response inflammation . Therefore investigator look volunteer high blood level CRP monitor blood CRP level several timepoints throughout study . The investigator also collect blood sample measure indicator inflammation , measure blood level anatabine .</detailed_description>
