	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Collatamp , small flat sponge soak antibiotic help improve success rate treatment acute joint infection joint replacement surgery . Our hypothesis patient receive Collatamp sponge improve success respect eradication infection one year follow treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While total hip knee replacement surgery remain highly successful treatment arthritis hip knee , infection follow joint replacement still remain issue , occur approximately 1-2 % joint replacement patient . Treatment infection remain difficult successful elimination infection quite variable , range low 10 % approximately 85-90 % , follow two stage revision . A two stage revision involve remove joint replacement implant replace cement spacer surgeon comfortable infection eliminate . In second part two stage revision cement spacer remove new joint replacement implant insert joint space . In particular , treatment acute infection , , infection occur early postoperative period patient le two week duration symptom , particularly problematic . As first line treatment , surgeon often perform irrigation ( wash wound stream water ) debridement ( surgical removal contaminate tissue ) surround joint hope preserve joint replacement , although success rate highly variable . Most treatment routine involve irrigation joint copious ( large ) amount fluid , removal infect soft tissue , replacement removable part ( example plastic liner femoral head ) intravenous antibiotic prolonged period time ( 6-8 week ) . It think part reason failure form treatment inability adequately provide local antibiotic joint environment joint replacement component place . In particular , formation bacterial slime infect organism , attach metallic component , think major hindrance remove infection . In theory , ability infuse local antibiotic joint could prove advantageous treatment joint replacement infection . Collatamp® like small flat sponge soak antibiotic delivers consistent dose fast-release antibiotic call Gentamicin Sulphate ( 2.0 mg/cm2 ) . The antibiotic concentrate locally tissue around joint replacement . The sponge reabsorb body therefore need surgically remove . Collatamp® sponge utilized clinical set 20 yr . This material use treatment orthopaedic , general surgery , cardiac infection , study set infected total joint replacement . The purpose study examine use CollatampTM sponge addition treatment acute joint infection total joint replacement surgery .</detailed_description>
