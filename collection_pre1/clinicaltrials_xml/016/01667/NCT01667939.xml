	<brief_summary>Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway oxidative stress participate endothelial dysfunction , one cause preeclampsia . Among human antioxidant mechanism enzyme catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) . Our aim measure NF-κB oxidative stress pregnant woman submit individualized diet pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity pregnancy associate exaggerated metabolic adaptation , endothelial dysfunction increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome , include preeclampsia , major cause maternal fetal morbidity mortality characterize increase blood pressure , proteinuria edema , affect approximately 3 % 7 % pregnant woman . Other risk factor , besides obesity , increase likelihood develop preeclampsia include chronic hypertension , diabetes mellitus . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) [ superoxide anion ( •O2- ) , hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) hydroxyl radical ( •OH ) ] ,5 interact protein , nucleic acid lipid process call lipid peroxidation ( LPO ) , cause severe cell tissue damage . There current evidence ROS common activator nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) , factor initiate systemic inflammatory process promote synthesis cytokine , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) expression intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM-1 ) . To maintain balance oxidative state , human body possess intracellular antioxidant enzyme system , include superoxide dismutase ( SOD , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , catalase ( CAT ) , locate mainly peroxisomes cytoplasm cell . The epidemiology preeclampsia , common among poor woman , previously suggest nutrient may involve disorder , unfortunately , nutritional data obtain woman syndrome poorly define . The objective paper provide overview biological plausibility potential mechanism underlying association among maternal nutrition , oxidative stress placenta risk preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
