	<brief_summary>The general objective study verify feasibility short home-based rehabilitation program cancer patient prior lung resection surgery , quantify effect aerobic capacity , exercise tolerance skeletal muscle strength . Therefore , hypotheses study : 1 . Implementation short home-based rehabilitation program ( 4 week ) base exercise training feasible safe patient lung cancer resection candidate . 2 . Compared control patient , patient include home-based rehabilitation program improve significantly aerobic capacity , exercise tolerance arm legs muscle force .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Short Home-based Rehabilitation Program Cancer Patients Waiting Lung Resection Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being lead cause death cancer , lung cancer represent press health issue generate significant social cost . In Canada , 2009 , estimate 23 400 people diagnosed lung cancer , 20 500 die disease . For people localize non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , lung resection surgery offer best chance cure disease . In addition lung cancer , patient often experience effect reduction exercise capacity tolerance , muscle weakness , decrease quality life . Many research demonstrate link low exercise capacity cardiopulmonary complication surround surgery . Therefore , implementation preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation program , focus improve aerobic capacity , could significant positive outcome , notably reduce operative risk . The effectiveness pulmonary rehabilitation , whether carried-out supervise set home-based program , well recognize program include guideline many pulmonary disease . Despite fact , research study impact lung cancer patient wait surgery . Moreover , one examine feasibility effectiveness home-based program population . We plan use time wait surgery increase exercise capacity work tolerance cancer patient wait surgery . Our expertise pulmonary rehabilitation prove invaluable carry research project objectives verify feasibility short home-based rehabilitation program cancer patient wait lung resection surgery , measure effect aerobic capacity , work tolerance muscle strength . In way , hope contribute develop innovative intervention assist Canadian Lung Association 's mission improve health patient respiratory problem . The result study lead toward development multicenter , randomize study design verify impact intervention postoperative complication population . Experimental design : This pilot study take place research center Institut de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Qu√©bec ( IUCPQ ) , collaboration thoracic surgery division Pavillon de Prevention de Maladies Cardiaques ( PPMC ) . Once lung cancer surgical procedure consider pneumologist , obtain patient 's consent proceed initial assessment . After initial evaluation participant undergo 4-week home-based rehabilitation program supervision exercise specialist certify American College Sport Medicine . Patients reevaluate 4 week . Preliminary screening : An initial screening , include maximal oxygen consumption assessment , perform supervision respiratory physician ( Dr F. Maltais ) ensure patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion study . In addition , brief history patient 's disease course medication record . Anthropometric measurement : Weight height measure determine Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . Body composition analyze bio-impedance ( InBody 520 , Biospace ) . Quality life psychological distress : Generic quality-of-life questionnaire provide information many aspects patient 's life also use discriminate patient within population . However , responsive change disease-specific questionnaire . Thus , generic quality-of-life assessment obtain time enrolment . The SF-36 survey select ease administration largely used questionnaire . A French version SF-36 currently available . These data obtain descriptive analysis . Pulmonary function test : Standard pulmonary function test include spirometry , lung volume , carbon monoxide diffusion capacity obtain subject initial evaluation , accord previously describe guideline , related appropriate reference value . Incremental cycle exercise test : In order determine peak aerobic capacity eligibility , quantify change exercise tolerance occur exercise training , incremental exercise test perform ( inclusion ) . Patients seat electrically brake ergocycle ( Quinton Corival 400 ; A-H Robins , Seattle , WA ) connect exercise circuit mouthpiece ( Sensor Medics , Vpeak Legacy , Yorba Linda , CA ) . A progressive stepwise exercise test perform individual 's peakimum capacity , use exercise step 1 minute increment 5-10 watt . Heart rate oxygen saturation record use pulse oximetry ECG , respectively . Symptoms dyspnea leg fatigue record use modify Borg scale perceive exertion52 . Testing take place medical supervision , exercise physiology laboratory IUCPQ research center . Constant workrate cycle exercise test 6-min walk test : A constant workrate cycle exercise test 6-min walking test perform quantify change exercise tolerance occur exercise training . 1 . During constant workrate cycle exercise test , patient ask pedal 80 % max exercise work rate determine maximal test , time exhaustion measure . Heart rate , dyspnea Borg score , oxygen saturation monitor . Supplemental oxygen use oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % . 2 . For 6-min walking test , patient also ask walk far possible 6 minute standardize encouragement53 . Two trial do best one use data analysis . Monitoring respiratory cardiac parameter , addition dyspnea leg fatigue ( modify Borg scale ) do test . Strength evaluation : 1 . Quadriceps strength assess two way . First , maximum voluntary contraction , second , measure supramaximal twitch tension series twitch follow magnetic stimulation ( Magstim 200 ; Magstim Co. ) femoral nerve previously describe . Generated force measure isometric force gauge subject standardized positioning . Validity sensitivity equipment previously study use previous study . 2 . Maximum voluntary contraction biceps brachii , deltoid hamstring measure hand-held dynamometer ( Microfet . Hoggan Inc , USA ) , use method describe validated Andrews colleagues56 . Finally , maximum prehension strength assess hydraulic dynamometer ( Jamar ) .</detailed_description>
