	<brief_summary>- Rationale : Recently , research demonstrate clear relationship build healthcare environment health wellbeing patient come available . Patients CT scan suite usually anxious . The environment show low stress ; paint piece art example , capture hold attention thereby lower negative thought evoke positive emotion . Sights nature demonstrate especially effective recuperate stress , presumably human brain evolve natural environment . The current study investigate effect exposure nature CT scan suite . A SkyCeiling , large , slightly illuminate , photographic illusion real sky view place CT scan . The main hypothesis study sky view lead low level anxiety CT scan suite . - Objective : The primary objective study examine effect view nature patient 's stress anxiety . Secondary objective study effect view nature patient 's environmental appraisal CT suite , satisfaction provide service , trust healthcare provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Examine Effect View Nature Patient 's Stress Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE The importance potential benefit well-designed healthcare facility widely acknowledge recent research clearly demonstrate relationship build healthcare environment patient ' health well-being ( Dijkstra , 2009 ) . Encounters healthcare situation generally characterize fear , anxiety , stress , uncertainty ( Mitchell , 2003 ; Pearson , Maddern , &amp; Fitridge , 2005 ) . Looking environment encounter take place , one might rightfully ask well healthcare environment satisfy psychological need patient . In order create beneficial environment , environmental stimulus add ( remove ) environment influence patient positive manner . The environment may elicit positive feeling , hold attention interest , block reduce negative thought , example , presence art view window ( R. S. Ulrich , 1984 ) . The purpose present study improve patient ' well-being add positive element exist healthcare environment , picture nature . Stress important factor healthcare situation stress reaction consider clinical problem since often result negative worsen medical outcome ( Malkin , 2008 ) . Previous study ( Volicer &amp; Volicer , 1978 ) , example , find hospital stress correlate change heart rate blood pressure . Other study show psychological stress impairs wind heal patient ( Christian , Graham , Padgett , Glaser , &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser , 2006 ; Kiecolt-Glaser , Marucha , Malarkey , Mercado , &amp; Glaser , 1995 ) . Elbrecht colleague ( Elbrecht et al. , 2004 ) study effect perceive stress cortisol level wound heal demonstrate considerable negative effect stress . Rabin ( 2004 Malkin 2008 ; personal communication 2008 ) propose pleasant healthcare environment perceive brain calming , mean stress reactive area brain decrease activity resultant decrease concentration cortisol norepinephrine blood . This result patient experience less pain , restful sleep , less anger , less muscle tension , low risk stroke . Furthermore , Kaplan Kaplan ( R. Kaplan &amp; Kaplan , 1989 ) state `` nervous system seem structured way pleasure pain tend inhibit '' . A pleasant healthcare environment could , therefore , result less stress anxiety patient lead good health increase feeling well-being . When speak pleasant healthcare environment , wide variety environmental characteristic come mind . Variables indoor plant music could help create environment generate positive feeling , consequence , reduce negative outcome . Nonpharmacological anti-anxiety intervention The advantage use environmental intervention low anxiety kind intervention carry risk time consume . Several study examine various method anxiety reduction healthcare environment . For example , research demonstrate beneficial effect scent anxiety mood dental patient ( Lehrner , Eckersberger , Walla , Poetsch , &amp; Deecke , 2000 ; Lehrner , Marwinski , Lehr , Johren , &amp; Deecke , 2005 ) Furthermore , music therapy successfully apply reduce pain anxiety patient undergo various medical procedure , child cancer undergo lumbar puncture ( Thanh Nhan , Nilsson , Hellstr√∂m , &amp; Bengtson , 2010 ) woman caesarian delivery ( Chang &amp; Chen , 2005 ) . Sunlight appear beneficial effect perceive stress ( Walch et al. , 2005 ) . A recent study ( Park &amp; Mattson , 2009 ) demonstrate indoor plant hospital room therapeutic value serve noninvasive effective complementary medicine surgical patient . Esthetic enhancement thus provide unobtrusive inexpensive stress anxiety management method . In study propose nature anti-anxiety intervention , possibly even strong effect anxiety scent , daylight music . Nature intervention Research restorative environment suggest certain environment capable promote recovery stress . Especially natural setting restorative effect ( Hartig , Book , Garvill , Olsson , &amp; Garling , 1996 ) . Considering potential healing property nature ( Lohr &amp; Pearson-Mims , 2000 ; R. S. Ulrich , 1984 ) , expose patient natural element may effective way reduce stress . A recent review conclude viewing nature scene may decrease pain perception elicit positive emotional response decrease stress ( Malenbaum , Keefe , Williams , Ulrich , &amp; Somers , 2008 ) . Ulrich et al . ( R. Ulrich et al. , 1991 ) study effect exposure nature stress recovery . Participants watch videotape induce feeling stress , afterwards expose tape either natural urban environment . Results demonstrate individual recover sooner stress expose former ( natural ) latter ( urban ) . Lohr Pearson-Mims ( 2000 ) study whether presence indoor plant would increase pain tolerance . Participants either placed room plant , room non-plant object ( visually distractive plant ) , control room ( object ) . Results show significantly large proportion respondent room plant able keep hand ice water 5 minute compare condition , suggest increase pain tolerance exposure indoor plant . They also show room plant rat positively ( e.g. , cheerful , calm , pleasant ) either control room . The result study support idea nature may beneficial effect health well-being people . Natural element build environment clearly show stress-reducing property , still unclear underlie mechanism cause stress-reduction . A potential explanation lie theory Kaplan ( S. Kaplan , 1987 ) Ulrich ( R. S. Ulrich , 1983 ) , state people tendency prefer natural setting build environment . Although two theory important difference ( see Hartig et al . ( 1996 ) discussion ) , base evolutionary assumption . The preference natural setting assume evolutionary base ; people extent biologically adapt natural oppose built environment . Secondly , might argue nature may process easily efficiently brain sensory system evolve natural environment ( Wohlwill , 1983 ) . As result , human innate tendency pay attention respond positively natural element ( Ulrich et al. , 1991 ) . This predisposition prefer natural element man-made object may explanation stress-reducing effect nature . It might thus hypothesize natural element affect feeling stress perceive attractiveness environment . In laboratory experiment , Dijkstra et al . ( Dijkstra , Pieterse , &amp; Pruyn , 2008 ) test hypothesis demonstrate stress-reducing property indoor plant simulated hospital room . Moreover , effect mediate perceived attractiveness hospital room . The presence indoor plant hospital result participant perceive room attractive , turn result less perceived stress . Considering potential infection risk real plant , Dijkstra ( Dijkstra , 2009 ) conduct second experiment figurative painting tree add patient room . This second experiment re-confirmed stress-reducing property nature , replicate mediate effect perceive attractiveness stress . Furthermore , stress reduce indoor plant , paint nature well . An association task reveal , next indoor plant , paint tree also activate concept nature . This suggest mere association nature could potentially lead beneficial effect . Taken together , nature intervention show beneficial variety setting . This include real simulated nature intervention . Applying nature intervention CT scan suite might thus lead beneficial effect patient . 2 . OBJECTIVES This research project aim gain insight physical environment CT scan suite affect patient ' health well-being . Patients undergoing procedure CT scan suite often anxious frighten . Stress reaction consider clinical problem since often result negative worsen medical outcome . Reduction state anxiety may help promote relaxation , turn beneficial patient 's sense well-being . Primary Objective : determine whether skyceiling lower stress anxiety diagnostic procedure CT scan suite . Secondary Objective ( ) : determine whether skyceiling improves environmental appraisal , mood , satisfaction provide service , time perception , trust healthcare provider .</detailed_description>
