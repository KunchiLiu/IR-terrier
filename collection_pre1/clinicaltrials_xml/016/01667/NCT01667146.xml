	<brief_summary>Some people develop condition call acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . This condition lungs become injured one number various cause , work normally provide oxygen remove carbon dioxide body . This lead reduce amount oxygen patient 's bloodstream . Patients ARDS admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) need help breathing connect ventilator ( breathe machine ) . ARDS lead injury organ body cause problem also death . Over past year , reduce size breath deliver ventilator conjunction use occasional sustained deep breath call `` recruitment manoeuvre '' use try prevent damage lung people ARDS . This ventilator strategy ( term PHARLAP strategy ) show small research study beneficial effect without cause obvious harm , compare current best practice ventilator strategy . The main beneficial effect PHARLAP strategy increase amount oxygen blood reduce marker inflammation ( body react disease process ) body . This study small make strong conclusion , study much large assess whether patient develop ARDS well use PHARLAP strategy . Three hundred forty patient enrol study multiple ICUs across Australia New Zealand . The study hypothesis PHARLAP strategy group high number ventilator free day day 28 control group .</brief_summary>
