	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine contribution spinal epimorph patient 's perioperative pain management Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) . This study design determine whether spinal epimorph associate complication necessary addition provide adequate analgesia give multimodal approach pain management . It hypothesize perioperative local infiltration cocktail local systemic analgesic provide equal analgesia patient give local infiltration spinal epimorph perioperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Use Spinal Epimorph Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial compare two patient population obtain patient receive primary total knee arthroplasty LHSC University Campus . Patient participant recruit consented arthroplasty clinic preadmit clinic University Hospital . Both patient measure primary outcome , namely , visual pain scale blind experimental treatment receive . Patients randomize receive either spinal epimorph ( 150ug ) spinal epimorph time total hip arthroplasty . This determine result computer generate randomization within block 10 ( every 10 patient even number patient within group ) . As patient sign give consecutive study number determine group assign . Note make current time patient undergoing total joint arthroplasty may may receive epimorph preoperatively depend anaesthesiologist ( personal communication Sue Ganapathy ) treatment arm represent current standard care LHSC . Again , spinal epimorph currently administer total joint replacement , irregardless whether study do . It acceptable standard care analgesic available anesthetist choose use . Many choose use feel improves analgesia patient undergoing total joint arthroplasty , recognize painful procedure ( especially total knee ) . This different one anesthetist preferring use dilaudid pain control another choosing use morphine . Both within accept standard care guideline individual staff utilize drug feel beneficial . This decision base individual consultant 's interpretation available literature well personal practice experience . I hope justifies study introduce new treatment . Patients receive spinal epimorph whether conduct study . As , formal study discontinuation rule applicable . Both patient group receive medical treatment require around time procedure . Both group patient receive standardize preoperative analgesia include gabapentin ( 600mg ) , acetaminophen ( 975 mg ) naprosyn ( 500mg ) . Both group receive local anaesthesia form local infiltration wind previously study cocktail morphine , ketoralac , epinephrine ropivicaine . ( 3 ) Post operatively patient remain PCA post operative day one change standardized oral protocol include long short act narcotic PRN basis , acetaminophen ( 975 mg Q6h x 48hrs PRN basis ) , naproxyn ( 500mg BID x 7 day ) gabapentin ( 300mg BID x 7 day ) . Postoperatively visual analogue pain scale record 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 48hrs well 1 week . Foley usage , oxygen usage , nausea/vomiting use antiemetic antipruritic also carefully document . Both patient group receive standard post operative physiotherapy discharge home prescription narcotic analgesic provide suitable analgesia hospital stay .</detailed_description>
