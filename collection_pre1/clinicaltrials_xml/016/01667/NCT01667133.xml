	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study Ponatinib Japanese Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , phase 1/2 , open-label study consist two phase . The first dose escalation phase employ modify 3+3 design two dose cohort ( 30mg 45mg ) . After 6 patient complete first cycle cohort , safety event evaluate open next dose cohort . Patients continue treatment long tolerate disease progression occur . Phase 2 occur recommend dose determine phase 1 additional 25 patient . Another 3 patient dose 15mg collection pharmacokinetic data . These patient may also escalate recommend dose assess efficacy safety phase 2 patient . Efficacy measure include molecular , cytogenetic , hematologic response rate various time point ; time response ; duration response ; survival follow-up . Safety measure include routine physical laboratory evaluation , adverse event monitoring , ECGs . Other measure include mutation test molecular genetic assessment . Accrual expect take approximately 12 month , patient follow survival 60 month last dose study drug ; therefore , estimate duration trial 72 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must CML phase ( CP , AP , BP phenotype ) Ph+ ALL , follow : All patient must screen bone marrow ( BM ) cytogenetics conventional banding perform within 42 day prior begin treatment . Examination least 20 metaphase require patient CP . If less 20 metaphase examine , BM aspirate must repeat . Adequate BM aspirate differential cell count require patient AP , BP , Ph+ ALL . If adequate aspirate obtain , aspirate must repeat . 2 . Be previously treat resistant , intolerant , define protocol , either dasatinib nilotinib CML least one TKI Ph+ ALL , regardless whether dasatinib nilotinib prior TKI use treat newly diagnose resistant patient . 3 . Must ≥ 18 year old . 4 . Provide write informed consent . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . 6 . Minimum life expectancy 3 month . 7 . Adequate renal function define serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) institution . 8 . Adequate hepatic function define : 1 . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × ULN 2 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT [ SGPT ] ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST [ SGOT ] ) &lt; 2.5 × ULN institution ( &lt; 5 × ULN liver involvement leukemia ) 3 . Prothrombin time &lt; 1.5 × ULN 9 . Normal pancreatic status define : 1 . Lipase ≤ 1.5 × ULN institution 2 . Amylase ≤ 1.5 × ULN institution 10 . Normal QT interval correct ( Fridericia ) ( QTcF ) interval screen ECG evaluation , define QTcF ≤ 450 m male ≤ 470 m female . 11 . For female childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test must document prior enrolment . 12 . Female male patient childbearing potential must agree use effective form contraception sexual partner throughout participation study . 13 . Ability comply study procedure , Investigator 's opinion . Patients eligible participation study meet follow exclusion criterion : 1 . Received TKI therapy within 7 day prior receive first dose ponatinib , recover ( &gt; grade 1 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 [ NCI CTCAE v.4.0 ] ) adverse event ( AEs ) ( except alopecia ) due agent previously administer . 2 . Received therapy follow : 1 . For CP AP patient , receive interferon , cytarabine , immunotherapy within 14 day , cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational therapy within 28 day prior receive first dose ponatinib . 2 . For BP patient , receive chemotherapy within 7 day prior first dose ponatinib . Otherwise , 2a applies . 3 . For Ph+ ALL patient , receive corticosteroid within 24 hour first dose ponatinib chemotherapy within 7 day prior first dose ponatinib . Otherwise , 2a applies . 4 . All patient exclude recover ( &gt; grade 1 NCI CTCAE v.4.0 ) AEs ( except alopecia ) due agent previously administer . 3 . Underwent autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant &lt; 60 day prior receive first dose ponatinib ; evidence ongoing graft versushost disease ( GVHD ) GVHD require immunosuppressive therapy . 4 . Take medication know associated Torsades de Pointes . 5 . Require concurrent treatment immunosuppressive agent , corticosteroid prescribe short course therapy . 6 . Have previously treat ponatinib . 7 . Patients CPCML exclude CCyR . 8 . Patients CPCML exclude baseline BM aspirate adequate conventional cytogenetic analysis 20 metaphase examine available . 9 . Patients APCML , BPCML , Ph+ ALL exclude MaHR . 10 . Patients APCML , BPCML , Ph+ ALL exclude baseline BM aspirate adequate cell count differential report available . Patients fibrotic marrow dry tap yield adequate cell count diagnosis evaluable classification , endpoint eligible . 11 . Have active central nervous system ( CNS ) disease evidence cytology pathology . In absence clinical CNS disease , lumbar puncture require . History CNS involvement exclusionary CNS clear documented negative lumbar puncture . 12 . Have significant active cardiovascular disease , specifically include , restrict : 1 . Myocardial infarction within 3 month prior first dose ponatinib 2 . History clinically significant atrial arrhythmia ventricular arrhythmia 3 . Unstable angina within 3 month prior first dose ponatinib 4 . Congestive heart failure within 3 month prior first dose ponatinib 13 . Have significant bleeding disorder unrelated CML Ph+ ALL . 14 . Have history pancreatitis alcohol abuse . 15 . Have uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride &gt; 450 mg/dL ) . 16 .
