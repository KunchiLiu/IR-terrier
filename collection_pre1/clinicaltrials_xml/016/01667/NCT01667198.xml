	<brief_summary>Professional society recommend endoscopists measure ceacal intubation rate , adenoma detection rate indicator screen colonoscopy quality . However , uncertain improve adenoma detection rate reduce inter-endoscopists ' variability detection adenoma . The investigator hypothesize hands-on-training intervention tailor result environmental assessment audit colonoscopy quality indicator result high adenoma detection rate improvement simple audit feedback . The investigator hypothesize train leader screen centre , effect intervention disseminate among endoscopists participate center , thus result additional increase individual adenoma detection rate . The primary aim compare impact adenoma detection rate two screen colonoscopy improvement program : 1 . Tailored training intervention . 2 . Audit feedback colonoscopy quality indicator .</brief_summary>
