	<criteria>All Participants : Native Chinese ( 4 grandparent Chinese origin ) Male participant female partner childbearing potential , partner pregnant breastfeeding , agree use reliable method contraception time first dose 3 month last dose investigational product , determine investigator . The method contraception may one following : condom spermicidal agent , male participant sterilization , true abstinence ( line participant 's usual lifestyle choice ; withdrawal calendar method consider acceptable ) . Female participant childbearing potential ( i.e . postmenopausal permanently sterilize [ e.g . tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy ] ) . Such participant require use contraception must test negative pregnancy time enrollment . Postmenopausal define least 1 year post cessation menses ( without alternative medical cause ) least 1 year spontaneous amenorrhea , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) â‰¥40 milli international unit per milliliter ( mIU/mL ) . Female participant undergone sterilization tubal ligation : agree use condom conjunction spermicidal gel , foam , cream , film suppository time screen 3 month last dose investigational product . Such participant must also test negative pregnancy time enrollment . Participants T2DM : Have T2DM control diet exercise alone single oral agent antihyperglycemic medication ( OAM ) ( metformin , sulfonylureas , meglitinides , acarbose [ disaccharidase inhibitor ] thiazolidinediones ) least 3 week ( 3 month thiazolidinediones ) admission . Note participant receive sulfonylurea , meglitinides acarbose may participate treatment stop metformin substitute . If switch metformin , participant allow stabilize metformin 3 week receive study drug . If T2DM control diet exercise alone , must hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) value 6.5 % 10.5 % screen fast blood glucose value 126 250 milligram per deciliter ( mg/dL ) ( approximately 7.0 13.9 millimoles per liter [ mmol/L ] ) screening . If T2DM control OAM ( ) , must HbA1c value 9.0 % less screen fast blood glucose value 110 200 mg/dL ( approximately 6.1 11.1 mmol/L ) screening . If participant 's T2DM control OAM ( ) metformin , participant 's OAM stop least 3 week administration study drug . All Participants : Have history presence cardiovascular ( myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , venous thromboembolism ) , respiratory , hepatic , renal , hematological , neurological autoimmune endocrine ( except T2DM ) , disorder capable significantly alter absorption , metabolism , elimination drug ; constitute risk take study medication ; interfere interpretation data . Have evidence significant active neuropsychiatric disease . Have poorly control hypertension ( systolic &gt; 160 millimeter mercury [ mmHg ] and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ) and/or evidence labile blood pressure include symptomatic postural hypotension . Have history presence pancreatitis ( history chronic pancreatitis idiopathic acute pancreatitis ) gastrointestinal disorder , example relevant esophageal reflux gall bladder disease , gastrointestinal disease impact gastric empty ( example , gastric bypass surgery , pyloric stenosis , exception appendectomy ) could aggravate glucagonlike peptide1 ( GLP1 ) analogs dipeptidyl peptidase ( DPP ) 4 inhibitor . Participants dyslipidemia , participant cholecystolithiasis ( removal gall stone ) and/or cholecystectomy ( removal gall bladder ) past , sequela , may include study discretion screen physician . Have personal family history medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) genetic condition predisposes MTC . Participants T2DM Have experience outpatient use insulin control diabetes within past 6 month . Have clinically significant peripheral vascular occlusive disease opinion investigator . Have know severe exudative diabetic retinopathy opinion investigator . Have know significant autonomic neuropathy evidence urinary retention , diabetic diarrhea , gastroparesis . Have experience ketoacidotic episode ( pH less 7.3 ) require hospitalization last 6 month . Regular use drug affect glycodynamics directly reduce gastrointestinal motility ( eg , anticholinergic , antispasmodic , 5HT3 antagonist , dopamine antagonist , opiate ) systemic corticosteroid oral , intravenous , intramuscular route , potent , inhale , intranasal steroid know high rate systemic absorption .</criteria>
