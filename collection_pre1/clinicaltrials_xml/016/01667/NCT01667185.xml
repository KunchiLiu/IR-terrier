	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety effectiveness G4 System ( System ) use adjuvant blood glucose test 7-day period pediatric subject diabetes mellitus . System effectiveness primarily evaluate comparison laboratory reference Yellow Springs Instrument ( YSI ) venous sample measurement . The system performance evaluate term point rate accuracy system reference YSI . The point accuracy measure proportion G4 System value within ±20 % YSI reference value glucose level &gt; 80 mg/dL ±20 mg/dL YSI glucose level &lt; 80 mg/dL . The trend accuracy device performance , i.e. , continuous glucose error grid analysis , evaluate well temporal accuracy different glucose rate change different glucose range ( hypoglycemic , euglycemic , hyperglycemic range ) . The primary matched pair ( Sensor-YSI ) measurement collect one in-clinic session . System effectiveness also evaluate SMBG measurement similarly . Safety data system also collect safety characterize incidence Adverse Device Effects ( ADE ) experience study participant . Other objective include evaluation device performance alternate site ( upper buttock ) .</brief_summary>
