	<brief_summary>We present study design clinical trial design assess clinical effect multispecies probiotic combination `` BIO-25 '' IBS-D patient . To aim primary endpoint study improvement abdominal pain stool consistency . The study also design powered investigate effect probiotic BIO-25 putative inflammation-associated parameter related microinflammation IBS , use postulated improvement Hs-CRP , calprotectin marker effect . Additional aim study examine possible effect probiotic BIO-25 cholinergic status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Probiotic treatment IBS safe effective . Probiotics show improve anti-inflammatory/proinflammatory ratio , may also improve intestinal motility , bacterial composition intestine . There substantial body evidence support use probiotic IBS . Probiotics appear particularly effective reduction abdominal bloating discomfort . The strain multispecies probiotic combination ( BIO-25 LR ) test found beneficial well-designed study IBS patient . Patients post-infectious IBS , well many patient `` classic '' IBS , manifest low-grade inflammatory state may associate visceral hypersensitivity impaired motility . Probiotics may suppress low-grade inflammation . In recent study find highly sensitive CRP ( hs-CRP ) , serum marker micro-inflammation , significantly high patient diarrhea-predominant IBS healthy control , although within normal limit group . Thus , hs-CRP may serve marker low-grade , sub-clinical inflammation . If treatment probiotic reduces degree low-grade inflammation IBS , improvement may reflect reduce hs-CRP level . This study contribute understand pathophysiology IBS provide evidence effectiveness probiotic treatment .</detailed_description>
