	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient often complain cognitive fatigue . There currently treatment symptom . Fampridine SR recently approve medication improves walk ability walk speed MS patient . It think might positive effect cognitive fatigue . This study compare fampridine 10mg twice day placebo order determine benefit medication cognitive fatigue MS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Fampridine SR Improve Cognitive Fatigue Multiple Sclerosis Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fampridine-SR ( 4-aminopyridine ) slow release oral medication act selective neuronal potassium-channel blocker . It investigate several multiple sclerosis ( MS ) study show improve ambulation , fatigue , endurance . The hypothesis mode action fampridine MS patient base fact demyelinate axon effectively conduct action potential partly due abnormal potassium current contribute conduction failure decrease action potential duration amplitude . Thus , potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine 3,4 diaminopyridine improve nerve impulse propagation enhance action potential formation , improve conduction prevent conduction block . In randomized , multicenter , double-blind , placebo control phase III trial , 301 patient treat either fampridine ( 10 mg BID n=229 ) placebo ( n=72 ) . Consistent improvement time 25 foot walk ( T25FW ) primary outcome measure . The proportion improve T25FW high fampridine placebo group ( 35 % vs. 8 % ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) . This data show fampridine improves walk speed MS. Additionally , study suggest `` responder effect '' mean MS subject respond medication respond well ( time walk responder ) , others show beneficial response ( timed walk non-responder ) . A responder define increase walk speed , compare placebo run-in , least 3 4 assessment treatment trial . However , study demonstrate responder could identify early first second week initiation treatment , significant difference responder non-responders time point . After discontinuation fampridine , T25FW score return baseline within one week MS Cognitive Fatigue It estimate 43-60 % patient MS cognitive dysfunction study use objective neuropsychological ( NP ) test consistently show impairment speed information processing sustain attention . Further , MS patient complain `` cognitive fatigue '' , symptom may may associate generalized/central fatigue . Cognitive fatigue define decline cognitive performance task require sustain cognitive activity . Although generalized motor/muscle fatigue show affect subjective assessment cognitive performance , affect performance objective cognitive measure . In contrast , cognitive fatigue demonstrate MS patient objective neuropsychological test . Kujala et al ( 1995 ) examine MS patient without mild cognitive impairment task sustain attention . Both group decline time healthy control . Krupp et al ( 2000 ) administer verbal learning/memory task twice separate continuous cognitively effortful task involve process speed attention . Normal control demonstrated increase number word recall ( +2.6 ) 2nd test administration , expect due practice effect . In contrast , MS subject show decrease test score ( -1.8 ) 2nd test administration . This difference find despite group subjectively report increase mental fatigue test period . Finally , Schwid et al ( 2003 ) examine decline performance Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) , measure process speed sustain attention . There 5.3-5.8 % decline correct responses compare MS subject ' performance beginning vs. end test . Normal control show significant decrease performance . Treating MS Associated Cognitive Impairment Cognitive Fatigue Currently approve MS specific medication show affect physical disability , relapse rate MRI progression MS subject cognition , fatigue cognitive fatigue main focus study . Further , symptomatic treatment generalize fatigue focus cognitive fatigue . Studies l-amphetamine find positive response measure process speed small sample MS subject , large , multi-centered placebo control trial Morrow et al find significant benefit . Cognitive fatigue specifically address study . Aminopyridines Cognition MS Population Only two previous study address effect aminopyridines cognition MS subject . In one study , benefit find . It important note primary aim study examine change generalize fatigue cognitive outcome tertiary outcome . Further , measure attention use validated MS population . In study , performance Rao 's Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery ( BRN-B ) treatment 4-aminopyridine compare . A trend find improvement measure verbal learn PASAT 2.0 second version , finding statistically significant . However trial underpowered , 20 subject . Summary Cognitive impairment cognitive fatigue common MS yet currently effective treatment debilitate symptom . Based propose mechanism action fampridine , probable improve cognitive fatigue MS improve nerve conduction . Using placebo control cross-over study two week washout period , change test attention process speed two condition compare . Since cognitive impairment lead cause work disability , well negative impact social activity relationship , improve cognitive fatigue contribute positively quality life MS patient . Trial Objectives To determine fampridine SR 10mg BID beneficial effect cognitive fatigue MS patient . Study Design Duration The design cross-over , placebo control , double-blind study four week treatment drug ( fampridine 10mg BID ) placebo separate one week washout period . For visit subsequent visit 1 , encourage subject ensure similar environmental behavioural compartment first assessment ( i.e . amount sleep , caffeine intake etc . ) try ensure similar test setting . Additionally , assessment occur similar time day visit 1 .</detailed_description>
