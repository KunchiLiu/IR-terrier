	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use nebulized hypertonic saline ( aerosolized salt water ) preventive treatment post-traumatic acute lung injury ( ALI ) . Both animal human research indicate aerosolize salt water might help reduce harmful inflammation minimal risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Nebulized Hypertonic Saline Attenuate Post-Traumatic Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite 40 year investigation , acute lung injury ( ALI ) remain leading cause morbidity critically ill patient , disease effective pharmacologic therapy . Our group others focus anti-inflammatory effect intravenous hypertonic saline ( HTS ) act injured endothelium promise result experimentally , fail confirm benefit clinically . Recent work , however , show inhaled nebulized HTS target epithelium safe effective treat cystic fibrosis , COPD , neonatal bronchiolitis . Recognizing central role pulmonary epithelium ALI , nebulization advantage achieve high concentration therapy without produce systemic side effect . Thus , hypothesize nebulized hypertonic saline attenuate acute lung injury follow trauma .</detailed_description>
