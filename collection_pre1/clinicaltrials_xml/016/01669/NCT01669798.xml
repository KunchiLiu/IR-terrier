	<brief_title>BIBF 1120 Bevacizumab Resistant , Persistent , Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer patient platinum-resistant refractory disease low response rate relapse chemotherapy : various chemotherapeutic agent , paclitaxel , liposomal doxorubicin , topotecan , docetaxel , platinum , etoposide , ifosfamide , gemcitabine , vinorelbine available result response rate 7-40 % . Unfortunately , relapse therapy curative treatment palliative . Recently two phase II trial demonstrate anti-angiogenic therapy bevacizumab alone combination chemotherapy woman recurrent disease response rate range 16-24 % acceptable toxicity profile . However , resistance develop VEGF inhibition . Therefore novel anti-angiogenic agent , BIBF 1120 , evaluate treatment ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
