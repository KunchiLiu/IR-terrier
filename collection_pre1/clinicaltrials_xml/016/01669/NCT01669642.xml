	<brief_summary>The purpose study find dose rapidly administer ketamine 3 different pediatric age group ( 2-5 , 6-11 12-17 ) abscess drainage fracture reduction . Ketamine common drug administer child facilitate painful procedure emergency set achieves potent sedation , pain relief amnesia minimal adverse cardiopulmonary effect . ( 1-5 ) However , 1-2 hour recovery period ( 1,6 ) associate standard ketamine administration guideline ( 7 ) strain work flow require bedside one-on-one nurse monitoring treatment room , tie limited valuable resource . Consequently , combination two drug , propofol + fentanyl ( P/F ) , recovery 20-30 minute , rapidly gain popularity procedural sedation despite frequent respiratory depression , apnea hypotension cause technique . ( 2,4,8,9 ) The investigator believe recovery associate novel method administer ketamine significantly short standard large dose slowly administer ketamine technique ( 7 ) . Through investigator clinical experience , investigator find rapid infusion small standard dos ketamine safely achieve drug 's sedative effect , benefit rapid recovery due use small dose . However , novel technique challenge publish beliefs time recovery ketamine sedation differ significantly dose administer , within usual dose range , rapid infusion may cause respiratory depression , similar see class sedative-analgesic drug . ( 7,10 ) investigator believe slow infusion recommend standard guideline ( 7 ) require large ketamine dose necessary achieve effective sedation , , consequently , prolongs recovery . It prolong recovery prompt increase use less safe briefer sedative , propofol/fentanyl . By demonstrate patient recover rapidly new ketamine technique , without increase adverse cardiopulmonary effect , investigator provide clinician important new method ketamine procedural sedation . The investigator believe clinician prefer rapid recovery ketamine technique safer reduce pain distress well propofol/fentanyl combination sedation . The investigator complete proposal require two step . In Step One , proposal , investigator determine minimum effective dose rapidly infuse ketamine achieves deep sedation least 5 minute 95 % child ( ED95 ) . Two group patient study : one group patient undergo abscess incision drainage group patient undergoing fracture reduction Emergency Department . The investigator believe ED95 different group severity pain different . The investigator compare safety recovery times publish standard ketamine technique . In follow study , Step Two , investigator compare novel technique , blind randomize trial use ED95 ketamine dose determine Step One standard ketamine technique determine novel technique result significantly short recovery without increase frequency adverse effect . The study investigator propose submission Step One .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Find Dose Rapidly Administered Ketamine Brief Painful Procedures Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During fracture reduction child , investigator find less distress use ketamine+midazolam ( K/M ) sedation ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) less hypoxia ( 5 % vs. 25 % ) compare sedation fentanyl+midazolam ( F/M ) ( 1 ) . Others also find less hypoxia K/M ( 4 % ) compare propofol+fentanyl ( P/F ) ( 18-31 % ) ( 2,4 ) . Because great safety efficacy determine similar study , ketamine common drug administer procedural sedation child undergo painful procedure ED . ( 7 ) For past 15 year , investigator sedate 2,500 child year ketamine St. Louis Children 's Emergency Department set broken bone , debriding burn , drain abscess , painful procedure . Midazolam co-administered ketamine early study reduce dysphoria recovery , practice since show beneficial . For past 5-10 year investigator use ketamine without midazolam see change child wake ketamine sedation . ( 6,11 ) Ketamine administration investigator previous study ( 1,3 ) similar recent recommendation ( 1.5-2 mg/kg I.V . infuse 30-60 sec ) ( 7 ) . Problematically , ED procedures fracture reduction , burn debridement , abscess incision drainage , require 5-10 minute deep sedation , standard ketamine technique result recovery period 60-120 minute ( 1,3,6 ) . During recovery , patient remain treatment room monitor one-on-one nurse respiratory depression , airway obstruction , vomit potentially life-threatening adverse event , thus tie limited resource ( 10 ) . This long recovery lead increase use propofol base technique rapid recovery ( 20-30 minute ) cause increased respiratory depression hypotension less effective sedation ( 2-6,9 ) . Because ketamine 's great safety efficacy profile , investigator interested develop alternative ketamine administration regimens result rapid recovery , similar propofol . If successful hastening recovery , investigator believe relative lack respiratory depression great analgesia ketamine improve patient safety encourage continue use ketamine prefer technique procedural sedation child undergo painful procedure ED . To explore new technique hasten recovery sedation , investigator take advantage uniqueness ketamine . Rapid administration opioid gabaergic drug fentanyl propofol significantly augment drug ' beneficial effect , also markedly increase respiratory depression , apnea hypotension . ( 13 ) Cautions rapid infusion ketamine may cause brief respiratory depression stem early anesthesia trial use dos large typically use sedation . ( 7 ) Although formally study , past 5 year investigator observe adverse effect rapid administration 0.5-1.5 mg/kg ketamine dos brief painful procedure like fracture reduction abscess incision &amp; drainage child Emergency Unit St. Louis Children 's Hospital . Lipophilic drug use procedural sedation-analgesia , ketamine , fentanyl , propofol rapidly diffuse bloodstream brain . A disproportionately high percentage cardiac output go brain , thus large portion drug inject intravenously initially go brain 's circulation first pass heart exert clinical effect within single circulation time , usually &lt; 60 second . The drug remain bloodstream circulates throughout body diffuses muscle , bone fat , cause blood concentration fall . The blood-brain concentration gradient favor drug diffusion brain patient awakens . Rapid infusion sedative drug increase central nervous system clinical effect direct large portion drug brain . A rapidly inject dose drug travel concentrate bolus brain circulation slowly inject dose dilute passing blood . With rapid injection , therefore , initial blood-brain concentration gradient great large portion dose initially enter brain , cause deep sedation . Smaller dose , rapidly inject , therefore use achieve deep sedation similar large dos inject slowly . With small dose , blood-brain concentration gradient subsequently reverse rapidly `` wake time '' shorter . Because rapid increase brain concentration ketamine cause respiratory depression , unlike see fentanyl propofol , rapid infusion technique use ketamine . The purpose research project determine formally minimum dose ketamine , rapidly infuse , achieve 5 minute deep sedation 95 % patient ( ED95 ) . The investigator use method ( 15 ) standard method anesthesiology find mean effective dose . Five minute typically enough time perform brief painful procedure . The investigator anticipate ED95 small standard recommend ketamine dose thus patient wake fast . Of special note , determination `` standard dose rate administration ketamine '' ( 7 ) base upon others ' study dose rate infusion ketamine carefully control , fact , vary widely ( 1,3,4,7 ) . Thus , `` standard recommendation administration ketamine '' somewhat anecdotal precisely determine . Our propose study first precisely determine minimum effective ketamine dose .</detailed_description>
