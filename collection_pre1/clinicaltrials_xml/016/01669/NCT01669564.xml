	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new tool , base currently implement `` Functional Assessment Screening Tablets ( FAST ) , '' activate patient partner physician . Completion project , FAST-PRI , provide important information effectiveness use HIT patient feedback inform activate patient promote health behavior change . Aim 1 Hypotheses : Patients receive self-management support HIT patient feedback ( intervention ) likely patient receive feedback ( control ) : - Initiate discussion provider regard study-designated PRI ; - Have discussion provider , regardless initiator , regard study-designated PRI ; - Perceive discussion study-designated PRI useful . Approach : We conduct 12-month randomized control trial HIT patient feedback , cluster physician level , academic group medical practice . Patients provider complete questionnaire regard discussion health behavior HRQoL clinical encounter . Aim 2 Hypotheses : HIT patient feedback result : 1 ) increase number smoking quit attempt , 2 ) increase physical activity , 3 ) improve mental HRQoL six , twelve month . Approach : Patient participant complete questionnaire regard smoke quit attempt , physical activity , mental HRQoL baseline , six twelve month . Aim 3 Hypotheses : For study-designated PRI , patient receive HIT patient feedback : 1 ) receive treatment recommendation ( e.g. , nurse educator , pharmacist , social worker referral ) ; 2 ) act treatment recommendation ; 3 ) exhibit improved self-efficacy regard ability make positive lifestyle change improve HRQoL ; physician whose patient receive HIT patient feedback high self-efficacy regard ability influence patient make positive lifestyle change improve HRQoL . These , addition discussion ( Aim 1 ) , mediate relationship HIT patient feedback improvement study-designated PRI . Approach : We survey patient physicians abstract referral data electronic medical record ( EMR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project , Functional Assessment Screening Tablets-Patient Reported Information , develop response PAR-08-270 : Utilizing Health Information Technology Improve Health Care Quality ( R18 ) . Tobacco , physical activity , poor mental health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) major cause morbidity mortality adequately address current system care . Healthcare provider play important role encourage healthy behavior identify factor impact patient ' HRQoL . Clinicians effective role partner inform , activate , engage patient . The investigator evaluate new tool , base current `` Functional Assessment Screening Tablets ( FAST ) , '' design inform activate patient patient report information ( PRI ) . The FAST currently use wirelessly-networked tablet computer collect PRI patient wait see primary care provider provide PRI provider time patient 's visit . The new health information technology ( HIT ) -based tool , use FAST-PRI intervention refer HIT patient feedback , provide patient self-management support immediate , personalize , guideline-based feedback health behavior ( tobacco use physical inactivity ) mental HRQoL encourages take active role health . Completion cluster-randomized control trial , FAST-PRI , provide important information effectiveness use HIT patient feedback inform activate patient promote health behavior change . The investigator accomplish follow three specific aim : Aim 1 . Use HIT patient feedback regard study-designated PRI ( i.e. , tobacco use , physical inactivity , mental HRQoL ) activate patient . Aim 2 . Assess impact HIT patient feedback study-designated PRI . Aim 3 . Evaluate potential mediator effectiveness HIT patient feedback study-designated PRI . The investigator conduct 12-month randomized control trial HIT patient feedback , cluster physician level , academic group medical practice . Patients provider complete questionnaire regard discussion health behavior HRQoL clinical encounter . In addition , patient participant complete questionnaire regard smoke quit attempt , physical activity , mental HRQoL , well self-efficacy use interdisciplinary referral baseline , six twelve month . The investigator survey physicians regard self-efficacy baseline , 12 24 month . Finally , abstract referral data electronic medical record regard health behavior , HRQoL , referral .</detailed_description>
