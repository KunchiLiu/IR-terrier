	<brief_summary>The current treatment individual alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) develop lung disease ( COPD ) administration intravenous purify alpha-1 antitrypsin ( augmentation therapy ) fix dose 60 mg/kg per week . This dose aim increase deficient AAT serum level predetermine `` safety threshold '' 11 uM . However , normal level AAT 25-50 uM . AAT show inhibit lung proteases neutrophil elastase , also modulate inflammation . Given many subject AATD receive augmentation therapy still significant lung disease inflammation , study evaluate whether double dose 120 mg/kg/week effect decrease lung inflammation . Only dose 60 mg/kg /week receive FDA approval . FDA grant IND number study test high dose 120 mg/kg/week . The study evaluate systemic ( serum ) pulmonary ( bronchoscopy sample ) marker inflammation 3 phase : standard dose ( 4 week ) , double dose ( 4 week ) standard dose ( 4 week ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Double Dose Alpha 1-antitrypsin Augmentation Therapy Lung Inflammation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study test effect double dose augmentation therapy Zemaira ( CSL Behring ) lung inflammation , compare standard dos 60 mg/kg/week . Our hypothesis patient AATD receive augmentation therapy standard dose 60 mg/kg/week continue significant lung inflammation may lead detrimental clinical consequence . This inflammation reduce high AAT dose . The study enroll 20 subject AATD COPD already receive augmentation therapy brand standard dos least month . For inclusion exclusion criterion see . Protocol : The study take place approximately 12 week : month receive Zemaira standard dose ( 60 mg/kg/week ) , month double dose ( 120 mg/kg/week ) month standard dose ( 60 mg/kg/week ) . The infusion standard dose do home infusion higher dos provide study site . study involve schedule blood draw clinical lab serum research sample . At end phase bronchoscopy perform ( 3 total ) obtain research sample ( lung lavage , brushing endobronchial biopsy ) . The first bronchoscopy receive 4 week standard augmentation therapy ass `` residual '' inflammation may present despite augmentation therapy . The second bronchoscopy double dose augmentation therapy phase ass change ( decrease ) inflammatory marker . The third bronchoscopy resume standard dose assess inflammation return baseline level ( require proof concept ) . There approximately 9 visit study clinic . This study include placebo ( active drug ) treatment . Besides blood draw bronchoscopy , study include questionnaire , lung function test urine sample testing .</detailed_description>
