	<detailed_description>The common cold ubiquitous illness man associate significant medical socioeconomic consequence . Current treatment common cold proven efficacy limit pharmacologic agent direct specific symptom . These treatments- antihistamine , nasal decongestant analgesics- limited effectiveness , generally relieve target symptom 15-25 % peak activity , associate bothersome side effect .

'' The common probiotic belong Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium genus . Bifidobacteria natural human gut inhabitant discover hundred year ago feces breast-fed infant . The study product Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies ( subsp . ) lactis Bl-04 ( Bl-04 ) genetically characterize B. animalis subsp . lactis 16S rRNA gene sequence full genome sequence comparison . Bl-04 deposited American Type Culture Collections safe deposit SD5219 . This study test hypothesis ingestion probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . lactis Bl-04 alter innate adaptive host response rhinovirus infection .</detailed_description>
