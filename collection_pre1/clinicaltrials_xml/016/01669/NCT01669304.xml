	<brief_summary>Vestibular migraine ( VM ) chronic subjective dizziness ( CSD ) commonly cause vertigo , unsteadiness dizziness . Clinical investigator study illness understand well . VM CSD occur together 1/3 patient . That make hard diagnose accurately decide treatment use . As result , doctor patient may confuse diagnosis . The goal study use two different medication tease apart symptom VM CSD . Patients VM CSD together give either verapamil sertraline 12 week . These medication use treat VM CSD , though approve purpose . Verapamil believe strong effect symptom VM . Sertraline believe strong effect symptom CSD . By compare response patient two medication , researcher hop learn key feature VM CSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic dizziness recurrent vertigo frequent complaint primary specialty medical care setting . Two common cause symptom vestibular migraine ( VM ) chronic subjective dizziness ( CSD ) , may see 25 % patient examine tertiary neurotology center . However , VM CSD relatively new diagnosis yet validate . Furthermore , recent research find co-exist 30 % time overlap several feature . From clinical standpoint , make difficult diagnose treat well . From research standpoint , confound subject selection mechanistic investigation . The primary goal study dissect VM CSD order identify key feature clarify diagnostic criterion condition . Subjects diagnose coexist VM-CSD treat either verapamil sertraline . It hypothesize differential treatment response two pharmacologic probe would help tease apart unique clinical feature VM CSD identify risk factor share separate two condition . It hop different mechanism action two study medication might also shed light physiologic underpinnings VM CSD . This project 14-week , prospective , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , pharmacologic dissection ( PD ) trial . A 12-week treatment period follow 2 week baseline observation . Patients chart daily headache vestibular symptom . VM CSD symptoms potential confounds anxiety depression measure two week interval . Data analyze differential share treatment effect align oppose current concept VM CSD . A PD trial use response one pharmaceutical probe ( drug ) study physiologic mechanism illness . A PD trial may provide data separate overlapping manifestation comorbid illness . This useful condition lack biomarkers . It also may provide data identify characteristic illness ( symptom , sign , cellular process ) associate specific pharmacologic mechanism .</detailed_description>
