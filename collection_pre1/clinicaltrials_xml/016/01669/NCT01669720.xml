	<brief_title>Adjuvant Aflibercept Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 1.2 million new case colorectal cancer 600,000 death worldwide . The liver dominant site metastasis . Approximately 20-25 % patient advanced colorectal cancer candidate resection/ablation site metastatic disease.1 Unfortunately , despite resection/ablation metastatic site 20 % patient ultimately cured.1 An effective adjuvant agent would prevent tumor recurrence . Aflibercept bevacizumab effective combine FOLFIRI metastatic colon cancer . Neither test randomize study adjuvant set patient resect metastatic disease . Since aflibercept effectively inhibit form VEGF include VEGF-A , VEGF-B PIGF , strike contrast bevacizumab inhibit VEGF-A , aflibercept likely effective bevacizumab single agent adjuvant metastatic setting . Therefore , propose randomize study adjuvant aflibercept patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive 10-12 cycle perioperative FOLFOX complete response sit metastasis chemotherapy local modality surgical resection ablation . SBRT may also use produce complete response metastatic site easily amenable surgery ablation . Only patient high risk recurrence , define 3 metastatic site , include study .</detailed_description>
