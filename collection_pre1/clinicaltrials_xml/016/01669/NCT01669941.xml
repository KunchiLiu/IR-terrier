	<detailed_description>Malaria pregnancy ( MiP ) due Plasmodium falciparum infection major cause maternal morbidity poor birth outcome . Pregnant woman increase risk frequent severe malaria infection non-pregnant woman . Intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy ( IPTp ) , administration treatment dose antimalarial predefined interval second third trimester pregnancy irrespective presence malaria parasitemia , currently recommend HIV-negative woman area stable moderate high transmission malaria . The strategy think work provide intermittent clearance suppression parasites placenta , prevent new infection occur prophylactic effect recommend drug IPTp , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) . SP drug currently use IPTp . Due increase resistance SP , longer use treatment symptomatic malaria , however , IPTp SP remain effective even area SP resistance child five ( determine vivo efficacy study ) 26 % . SP therefore continue use IPTp many country longer used treatment symptomatic malaria . However , recent data northern Tanzania Malawi indicate high rate resistance , IPTp-SP may longer effective , could potentially harmful . In view data , search alternative IPTp-SP warrant . One strategy would choose different drug IPTp . Of available combination , Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine ( DP ) remain one attractive option long half-life piperaquine ( PQ ) demonstrate efficacy safety pregnancy . Another strategy consider intermittent screen treatment pregnancy ( ISTp ) , whereby increase screening time focus antenatal care ( FANC ) treatment woman screen positive . The property ( long half-life , tolerability , safety , daily dose ) make DP good choice IPTp also make one best available option ISTp . This study aim compare efficacy IPTp-SP IPTp-DP ISTp-DP determine alternate strategy associate reduction malaria infection delivery among HIV ( - ) woman area decrease malaria transmission high level SP resistance Kenya .</detailed_description>
