	<brief_summary>Primary research hypothesis : Patients continue chronic ACEI therapy include morning intermediate risk surgery experience intraoperative hypotension hold chronic ACEI perioperatively . Secondary research hypothesis # 1 : Patients continue chronic ACEI include morning intermediate risk surgery experience well postoperative control hypertension hold chronic ACEI perioperatively . Secondary research hypothesis # 2 : Patients continue chronic ACEI include morning intermediate risk surgery experience less acute renal failure hold chronic ACEI perioperatively . Secondary research hypothesis # 3 : Patients preoperative systolic blood pressure le 110 mmHg continue chronicACEI therapy perioperatively significant decrease blood pressure anesthesia compare preoperative systolic blood pressure great 110 continue chronic ACEI . Secondary research hypothesis # 4 : Patients age 64 continue chronic ACEI therapy perioperatively significant decrease blood pressure anesthesia compare age 64 young continue chronic ACEI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine discontinuation angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) necessary prior intermediate risk surgery . ACEIs associate intraoperative hypotension vascular cardiac surgery . Patients present UNMC Pre-Anesthesia Screening ( PAS ) Clinic intermediate risk surgery chronic ACEI therapy eligible enrollment . Subjects randomize either continue hold ACEI perioperatively . The outcome interest intraoperative hypotension define systolic blood pressure le 60 mmHg decrease systolic pressure great 30 % . Blood pressure follow throughout surgery , also recovery remainder hospitalization . Renal function assess creatinine measurement PAS clinic first postoperative day . No follow-up plan beyond discharge hospital .</detailed_description>
