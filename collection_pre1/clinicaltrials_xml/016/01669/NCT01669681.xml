	<brief_summary>The severe asthma major source expense term public health , concern 5 % asthmatic . The expense direct ( medicine , hospitalization , care ) especially indirect ( absenteeisms , etc. ) . The forward-looking follow-up cohort 500 severe asthmatic patient multicentrique already widely establish cohort ( COBRA , present Visit 9 ( one every 6 month ) once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , couple data CPAM , identify well evolution time real medical economic variable . The possibility dynamic follow-up expense compare medical data offer perspective evaluation cost-efficiency inform therapeutic procedure . It possible couple forward-looking dynamic way data health stem cohort economic data stem CPAM . This variable include Cluster 's algorithm allow identify intervention less cost effective . The main objective study realize cost estimate care severe asthma . The variation cost also study . The recruited patient patient already include cohort COBRA center Marseille , Montpelier Nice , classify GINA 4 agree participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The follow direct medical cost collect accord point view Social Security duration 2 year : - Hospitalizations ( valuation GHS + medicine except GHS ) Â· Consultations ( valuation AM ) - Complementary ( additional ) examination except hospitalization ( valuation AM ) - Pharmacy ( valuation AM ) - Transport ( valuation AM ) The estimate average cost make reliable interval 95 % . The average cost patient care calculate every year follow-up . Relationship individual cost-efficiency : analogy study cost-efficiency comparative clause , investigator shall calculate relationship cost-efficiency individual level follow : ( cost-year2 - cost-year1 ) / ( efficiency-year2 - efficiency-year 1 ) . Differences relationship look various group test comparison averages.The construction patient ' cluster make accord algorithm study SARP also use technique statistic classification non supervise define algorithm . Variables use algorithm include relationship cost efficiency individual addition clinical variable . The temporal stability relationship cost efficiency analyze . The risk factor modification relationship look .</detailed_description>
