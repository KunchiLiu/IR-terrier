The board certify music therapist accompany subject operating room assure volume level electronic equipment function properly . Anesthesia personnel apply BIS monitor propofol administration . Anesthesia personnel titrate propofol obtain BIS read 70 low record propofol microgram per kilogram per minute , infuse point . Signal Quality Index ( SQI ) record BIS reach 70 give credibility BIS monitor . SQI measure signal quality EEG channel source calculate base impedance data , artifact , variable . The total amount propofol case record total milligram receive . Anesthesia personnel record Observer 's Assessment Alertness/Sedation ( OAA/S ) BIS monitor reach 70 incidental data point . A score 3 OAA/S indicate patient responds mild prod shaking . OAA/S compare BIS read . Time PACU Patient Satisfaction : Recorded music continue play subject meet discharge criterion accord University Hospital 's policy procedure . The amount time patient leave operate room meet discharge criterion ( determined nurse ) record . Patient satisfaction record use Likert scale : 7= highly satisfy ; 1=not satisfy subject meet discharge criterion . Controls : The control group subject receive standard anesthesia , nurse surgical care . All rating procedure . Controls wear noise reduce headphone . The music therapist accompany control patient follow surgery . When trial complete , music therapist offer control subject CD record music meet discharge criterion data record . This occur sake ethic .</detailed_description>
