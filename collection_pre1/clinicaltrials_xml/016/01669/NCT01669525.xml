	<brief_title>Placental Growth Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The placenta know play vital role maintain healthy pregnancy . Placental dysfunction believe driving factor variety adverse obstetric outcome , include fetal growth restriction preeclampsia . Advances 3D ultrasound allow measurement placental volume pregnancy . It may quantitative assessment early placental growth help identify pregnancy risk adverse outcome . Furthermore , various novel serum analytes propose predictor adverse outcome . The investigator seek prospectively measure placental volume diameter 11-14 week 18-24 week determine placental growth predict adverse outcome . In addition , investigator seek investigate relationship placental growth serum level various biomarkers see improved detection adverse outcome achieve .</detailed_description>
