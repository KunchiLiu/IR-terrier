	<brief_title>Angio-Seal® vs. Exo-Seal® Closure Arterial Puncture Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction In patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) rate vascular complication 0.8 % 5.5 % ( 1 ) . Albeit femoral sheath size reduce , arterial compression long-term dressing PCI still bear tremendous discomfort groin pain patient . Furthermore , manual compression puncture site perform activated clotting time 180 second ( 2 ) . Therefore , vascular closure device ( VCD ) develop reduce access site bleeding , improve patients´ comfort , accelerate ambulation PCI . The hemostatic puncture closure device Angio-Seal ( St. Jude Medical , St. Paul , MS , USA ) collagen base plug system anchor inner vessel wall . ExoSeal ( Cordis , Warren , NJ , USA ) extravascular polyglycol acid ( PGA ) plug , close puncture site extravascular basis occlude puncture channel . The aim current , randomized study , evaluate effectiveness , safety reliability 2 different vascular closure device . Methods Consecutive patient stable angina pectoris silent ischemia positive stress test randomize either Angio-Seal Exo-Seal , include study give write informed consent . Patients contraindication VCD include 1. severe calcification vessel site , 2. severe peripheral artery disease , 3. puncture origin femoral profundal artery , 3. non-femoral sheath insertion , 4. mark tortuosity femoral iliac artery , 5. mark obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 ) 6. cachexia ( BMI &lt; 20 ) exclude study ( 3 ) . As clinical exclusion criterion serve : 1. emergency intervention , 2. use Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-antagonists intervention , 3. patient continuous medication oral anticoagulant . All patient load either 300 mg 600 mg Clopidogrel 60 mg Prasugrel 180 mg Ticagrelor , follow maintenance dose 75 mg 150 mg Clopidogrel 5 mg 10 mg Prasugrel , 90 mg Ticagrelor prior intervention . After insertion 6 F sheath , unfractionated Heparin ( UF ) give activate clot time-level ( ACT ) 250 achieve . The use low -molecular weight Heparin ( LMWH ) accord recommendation manufacturer purpose anticoagulation PCI possible . The simultaneous use UF LMWH avoid . Patients receive PCI accord standard protocol ( 8 ) . After procedure , angiography access femoral artery perform rule major risk factor retroperitoneal hemorrhage , relevant peripheral stenosis common superficial femoral artery , location puncture site bifurcation profundal femoral artery ( 9 ) . In addition , method identify patient non-femoral artery sheath insertion , VCD utilization proven ( 10 ) . Patients strong tortuosity and/or calcification femoral artery also exclude study ( see exclusion criterion ) . Towards end intervention ACT record : Angio-Seal ExoSeal may implant ACT &lt; 300s . In patient randomize manual compression without patch sheath remove ACT &lt; 180s . The use protamine leave discretion operator . In patient randomize either Angio-Seal Exo-Seal placement perform use manufacturer´s recommend technique . The operator familiar device use study , perform vascular closure device least fifty time . After insertion VCD circular groin dress apply , patient immobilize 4 hour . After , arterial puncture site examine , auscultation perform . If relevant complication , ambulation initiate . Pain closure procedure manual compression categorize accord Borg scale , minor pain define Borg &lt; 5 major pain Borg ≥ 5 ( 13 ) . In patient manual compression without patch , immobilization last 8 hour . After , inspection puncture site perform mention . Anticoagulation either unfractionated heparin low molecular weight heparin restart 6 hour resolution dress . On subsequent day , ultrasound Doppler spectral analysis puncture site perform patient . Complications assess major minor : Major complication define need vascular surgery , false aneurysm , AV-fistula , strong pain ( Borg ≥ 5 ) , hematoma ≥ 5 cm major bleeding , whereas minor pain , hematoma &lt; 5 cm new wound dress classify minor complication . Bleeding identify bleed accord TIMI criterion ( 12 ) . TIMI major bleeding define hemoglobin drop &gt; 5 g/dl ( without identify site ) , TIMI `` loss site '' haemoglobin drop &gt; 4 g/dl &lt; 5 g/dl without identify bleeding site , TIMI minor bleed hemoglobin drop &gt; 3 g/dl &lt; 5 g/dl bleed know site spontaneous gross hematuria . Again pain categorize accord Borg scale , minor pain define Borg &lt; 5 major pain Borg ≥ 5 ( 13 ) . Demographic procedural data prospectively collect use standardized procedural data sheet . This include date type intervention , sheath size , procedure-related drug dos , number previous intervention . Major minor complication , well time event record . Statistical analysis Randomization perform Statistical analysis perform SPSS version 16.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Continuous data express mean value +/- standard deviation . For comparison pair data student t-test use . A p-value &lt; 0.05 regard statistically significant . Risk-benefit ratio Achieving adequate hemostasis crucial prevention access site complication patient undergo PCI ( 3 ) . The occurrence vascular complication independent predictor nonfatal myocardial infarction death within one year intervention ( 14 ) , associate significant increase mortality ( 15 ) . Advanced age , female gender , pre-existing vascular disease , emergent procedure , low body surface area ( 4 , 8 , 14 ) , diabetes , hypertension , cigarette smoking ( 15 , 16 ) also associate increase bleed risk . Therefore adequate hemostasis still remain challenge interventional cardiology . The recently introduce extravascular closure device ExoSeal theoretically offer advantage . First , foreign body , introduced artery , , misplace potentially lead occlusion artery , inflammation allergic reaction . In addition , device might use patient common contraindication VCD´s like calcification , peripheral artery disease tortuosity artery . Since device already introduce , evaluate sufficiently , need randomize comparison establish system . The risk-benefit ratio well site benefit , since device regularly use interventional cardiology estimate complication rate range even low , , report literature .</detailed_description>
