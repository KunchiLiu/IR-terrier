	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Lithium Carbonate Combined With Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy Treat Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteosarcoma common primary malignant bone tumor childhood adolescence , prognosis disease poor . What 's , chemotherapy resistance serious myelosuppression occur frequently clinical hinder canonical adjuvant chemotherapy . In previous research , observe GSK-3B positively regulate NF-kB pathway promote proliferation tumorigenicity osteosarcoma cell . Targeted inhibition GSK3beta show obvious antitumor effect . It promise therapeutic target osteosarcoma , especially GSK-3b inhibition combine chemotherapeutic drug . Lithium carbonate , commonly use clinical application fine quality cheap price , proven effect kind GSK3beta inhibitor stimulate factor peripheral blood leukocyte . Therefore , lithium carbonate theoretically possess effect anti-tumor well improvement myelosuppression . We look forward result clinical trial test effect combination chemical drug lithium carbonate myelosuppression , disease-free survival rate lung metastasis rate patient osteosarcoma treated conventional chemotherapeutic regimen wide resection . This study multi-centre , double-blind , randomized clinical trial phase 4 . The inclusion criterion patient primary osteosarcoma femur , tibia humerus（IIB） . With help statistic method , 400 patient randomly divide two group accord sequence enter group : lithium carbonate group control group ( 1:1 ) . Patients suggest continue trial end chemotherapy regimen confirm disease progression RECIST guiding principle . According histological type , patient analyze use subgroup analysis . Disease evaluation conduct every 8 week . A follow-up count overall survival rate grouping perform within least 24 month 120 month . Our study may represent novel feasible approach combination conventional chemotherapy drug target drug . More importantly , may hopefully promise strategy improve overall survival osteosarcoma .</detailed_description>
