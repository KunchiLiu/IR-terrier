	<brief_summary>ChAd63 METRAP MVA METRAP investigational vaccine malaria study clinical trial 4 year , 10 year , respectively . These vaccine inactivate virus modify reproduce human . Genetic information add make express protein malaria parasite stimulate immune response malaria . This trial examine whether compound call Matrix M™ use effort improve well vaccine work prevent malaria . Matrix M™ vaccine adjuvant , compound use improve immune response vaccine . In trial , Matrix M™ combine vaccine . The objective assess safety vaccine combine Matrix M™ , determine effect Matrix M™ immune response vaccine . We assess safety vaccine ( ChAd63 METRAP combine Matrix M™; MVA METRAP combine Matrix M™ ) administer healthy volunteer monitor 6 month total . Eight volunteer receive vaccine low dose Matrix M™ , eight receive vaccine standard dose Matrix M™ , six volunteer receive vaccine alone comparison group . We also look effect Matrix M™ immune response vaccine , measure blood test . Volunteers study visit Clinical Centre Vaccinology Tropical Medicine Churchill Hospital site , Oxford , vaccination , blood take monitor safety measure immune response vaccination , monitor symptoms/side effect vaccination .</brief_summary>
