	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine computerize version Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) improve high-risk sexual behavior patient attend outpatient methadone treatment clinic . This population high risk contract spread hepatitis HIV . When added treatment usual ( TAU ) , CBT session increase total exposure client education reduce risky sexual needle use behavior provide real world examples . This study seek determine use CBT program easily add clinical program patient satisfied use . The main hypothesis use computerized CBT addition treatment usual improve knowledge reduce occurrence unprotected sexual activity . The study also look patient clinic cost related CBT intervention , drug use retention/adherence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan conduct randomized pilot trial evaluate feasibility promise computerize CBT single module target risky sexual behavior HIV/Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) high risk population . In context drug treatment program , randomize 60 methadone maintenance patient either standard treatment usual program ( TAU ) TAU plus HIV/HCV/STD risk reduction module CBT4CBT ( `` Stay Safe '' ) . Participants assess baseline , one month three month time point . The primary outcome measure knowledge regard risk infection transmission HIV/HCV/STD , self report assessment risky sexual practice , retention study client satisfaction module . Our specific aim follow : 1 . To determine feasibility integrate CBT4CBT/ '' Stay Safe '' setting . Feasibility determine completion assessment 1 3 month time point ( retention ) satisfaction rating participant randomize computer module . 2 . Compare knowledge HIV/HCV/STD transmission prevention intervention . This assessed percent correct answer quiz administer assessment . 3 . To evaluate change drug sex risk behavior treatment . The primary outcome measure number unprotected sexual encounter self-assessment instrument risky sexual behavior . We hypothesize single session computer-based CBT result reduce risky sexual behavior increase knowledge HIV/HCV/STD transmission difference retention intervention . A successful outcome pilot project would result effect size 0.30 outcome risk behavior . This intervention compare treatment usual participate site , currently consist two group educational session safety regard risk HIV/AIDS hepatitis . Preliminary Data- The case computer-based behavioral treatment Computer-assisted therapy offer relatively novel approach dissemination Evidence Based Therapies ( EBT ) behavioral intervention . Existing evidence point efficacy cost-effectiveness . Computer-based intervention offer number attractive characteristic use primary care substance treatment setting . Their low cost couple high consistency , accessibility standardization associate advantage . Ease implementation critical reaching patient remote rural area small medical office primary care provider become mainstay substance abuse treatment . Risky sexual behavior target without potential negative association face face behavioral intervention highly sensitive domain thus may ideally modulate computer-based therapy . Equivalency counselor-based education learn new health behavior , cost-effectiveness , patient satisfaction accessibility illiterate patient advantage show computer-based therapy . Computer-based CBT : Carroll et al . Yale develop effective computer-based version CBT , call `` CBT4CBT '' demonstrate efficacy reduce drug use building cop skill . ( 38 ) The program make extensive use 'movies ' teaching tool : In module , user watch individual confront difficult situation relevant module 's topic ; teach key skill variety strategy , 'movie ' repeat different end character implement target cop skill . In develop CBT4CBT , seek develop engage version CBT could take advantage capacity computer-based learn convey information via wide range medium ( e.g. , text , video , graphic , audio instruction , interactive exercise ) . The CBT4CBT program highly user-friendly , require previous experience computer minimal use text-based material ( i.e. , minimal reading require ) , highly interactive . In particular , capitalize use videotaped example allow user actually see examples individual utilize skill strategy range realistic situation . Viewers able watch real-life challenge act safe behavior model , address negative detrimental thought process predispose unhealthy risky behavior choice ( e.g . make decision sex without condom ) . Viewer knowledge base target didactic portion role playing model actor . The module include opportunity client print perform 'homework ' worksheet , show predictive successful outcome CBT . The module allow considerable control viewer , choose speed progression screen capability go back previous screen review . Single CBT module application : Our original feasibility , efficacy , durability cost-effectiveness study addiction treatment employ full version CBT4CBT , comprise 7 module . One independent module focus entirely target risky sexual drug use practice ( title `` Stay Safe '' ) , evaluate independent module effect risk reduction . The `` Stay Safe '' module develop Dr. Kathleen Carroll team Yale consultation Connecticut AIDS Education Training Center director ( Karina Danvers ) others . Its development involve input CBT expert ( Dr. Carroll , Dr. Michael Copenhaver ) , infectious disease specialist substance abuse treatment patient volunteer review module . Like substance abuse target section , script write easily recognizable across many socioeconomic cultural group . Professional actor hire play part substance user two separate high risk situation , one sexual one Intravenous drug use ( IDU ) . Skills teach multimedia presentation allow user direct pace module , well view consequence various choice risky situation . The intervention propose pilot study single target module , `` Stay Safe '' . The module complete virtually computer , thus ideal implementation , wide range setting . Its expense clinical use also reduce result brevity . These characteristic make easily disseminate , `` real world '' application setting substance use treatment primary care medicine . Overview : In order maximize scientific yield project , intentionally design study parallel landmark Calsyn ( 5 ) Tross ( 6 ) randomize trial evaluate effect 5-session group CDC behavioral approach risky sex practice reduction substance abuse treatment program . We seek compare closely possible variable therapy type ( computerized CBT study versus group therapy safer sex skill building ) , seek minimize difference outcome measure method . Use parallels design outcome measure allow u 'benchmark ' outcome report change study . Study Population Sample : Hartford Dispensary ( Hartford , CT ) serve site . Drug treatment medical service offer outpatient basis . This study enroll client undergo IDU treatment methadone site . These client come regularly schedule maintenance medication clinical monitoring well standard counseling . Many ( roughly 55 % ) patient already HCV and/or HIV positive therefore pose significant risk transmission virus rout IDU . Recruitment : Clients identify self-presentation response advertisement flier clinic . Drug counsel provider may also ask client interested participate study . A sample size 60 ( 30 patient per group ) feasible would sufficient detect large effect size risky sexual behavior [ Cohen 's d= 0.3 , ( alpha.05 , power0.8 ) ] . This effect size small report behavioral study literature , sufficient evaluate feasibility promise propose intervention pilot .</detailed_description>
