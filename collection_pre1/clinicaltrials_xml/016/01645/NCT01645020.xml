	<detailed_description>Weakness pelvic floor support cause defect damage pelvic organ function urinary control pretty common occurrence . It suggest recently event consider hernia require mesh use , reduce return rate follow pelvic floor repair . Mesh use know cause complication unwanted side effect , chronic pain , vaginal network exposure infection . The degree complication relate directly mass mesh , 's absorbable mesh developed.Two month surgery absorbable mesh , mass leave patient 's body half initial mesh mass accord assumption effect minimize extent intensity mesh complication compare conventional one . During study examine medical record woman surgery pelvic floor reconstructive mesh . The case divide accord mesh type use . A polypropylene mesh ( single strand tunnel wide ) trade name `` Prolift '' , similar mesh contains approximately half network mass dissolve two month , trade name `` Prolift + '' M. The number participant group 120 woman . The post-operative follow-up examination include three point time . After month , six month year later . In addition questionnaire order quantify degree urinary disturbance , pain surgery sexual function .</detailed_description>
