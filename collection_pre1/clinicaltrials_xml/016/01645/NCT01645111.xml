	<brief_summary>The current study would prospectively evaluate dosing requirement , efficacy safety clevidipine control hypotension spinal surgery pediatric population . As investigator currently project underway include patient scoliosis surgery idiopathic scoliosis , trial would include undergoing scoliosis surgery neuromuscular disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label Trial Clevidipine Controlled Hypotension During Spinal Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This would basically observational study without significant change current practice . There would change standard usual anesthetic care include premedication , anesthetic induction , intraoperative anesthetic management , intraoperative monitoring . Our usual anesthetic routine include : 1 . Intravenous oral premedication midazolam 2 . Inhalational intravenous induction base preference patient 3 . Facilitation endotracheal intubation dose rocuronium placement intraoperative monitor include arterial cannula 4 . Maintenance anesthesia include desflurane titrate maintain bispectral index 40-60 , fentanyl 2-4 µg/kg follow remifentanil infusion maintain mean arterial pressure 55-65 mmHg . 5 . Tranexamic acid limit intraoperative bleeding 6 . As need , agent control blood pressure maintain MAP 55-65 mmHg remifentanil dose 0.3 µg/kg/min ineffective . As need , clevidipine start 1 µg/kg/min titrate 1 µg/kg/min every 1-2 minute achieve MAP 55-65mmHg . Vital sign include heart rate record every 1 minute target MAP achieve 15 minute increment .</detailed_description>
