	<brief_summary>Epilepsy frequent cause morbidity pediatric age group . Many catastrophic epilepsy present infancy childhood1 . Seizures epileptic disorder difficult control ; sometimes expense multiple toxic level antiepileptic medication . The shortcoming antiepileptic drug therapy epilepsy surgery warrant need alternative treatment . Ketogenic diet effective refractory epilepsy ( 33 % patient refractory epilepsy 50 % reduction seizures baseline 15-20 % become seizure free ) gain widespread acceptance . Low glycemic index diet treatment ( LGIT ) design variant ketogenic diet . There retrospective study LGIT childhood refractory epilepsy reporting seizure reduction comparable patient ketogenic diet . There randomize control trial assess efficacy low glycemic index diet refractory epilepsy . In study plan ass efficacy LGIT among child drug refractory epilepsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each patient undergo detail clinical evaluation accord structure proforma . Seizure type , frequency , age onset , perinatal detail , family history , developmental status treatment history record . Corticosteroids ACTH ( patient already ) would taper 2 week start LGIT . All co-medications change carbohydrate free preparation , wherever available intervention group . Eligible patient randomize two group : intervention control arm . Both group undergo baseline four week observation period , parent ask maintain daily seizure log ; record seizure type , duration frequency . In intervention arm , child start low glycemic index diet 4-week baseline period . The control group receive usual diet without alteration . No change make patient ' antiepileptic medication 4-week baseline 3-month study period intervention control group , unless medically indicate ; e.g . drug side effect , status epilepticus ; case appropriate change make medication document . The drop intervention group document along reason . At end 3 month study period patient intervention arm continue LGIT come purview study . At end three month study period , patient control arm offer option low glycemic index diet treatment . Low glycemic index diet administration 1 . Three day food intake recall method document 2 . The calorie requirement would calculate per recommend daily allowance ( RDA ) ideal weight age 3 . Diet regime explain parent 4 . Patients ( wherever applicable ) parent give diet counsel 5 . LGIT start patient basis . 6 . Medium high-GI carbohydrate ( GI &gt; 55 ) eliminate diet food item low glycemic index ( GI &lt; 55 ) allow . Parent give list low glycemic index food items33 . They also give list food item ( medium high glycemic index ) avoid . ( Appendix ) 7 . Total carbohydrate intake restrict 10 % caloric intake/ day ( maximum 40-60 g/day ) . 8 . Carbohydrate value various food item explain detail , carbohydrate exchange list provide parent . Three four 15 gram carbohydrate exchange allow day . ( Appendix ) 9 . Fats ( e.g . cream , butter , oil ghee ) take patient without restriction . 10 . Proteins intake allow 30 % total caloric intake per day ( cheese , fish , egg , chicken soya product ) . 11 .
