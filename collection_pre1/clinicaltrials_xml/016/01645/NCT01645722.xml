	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study assess efficacy minimally invasive autologous fat transfer amputation site modulation pain respective site . Our investigator hypothesize autologous fat graft provide minimally invasive therapy effectively mitigate pain syndrome amputation site , introduce volume stable subcutaneous tissue bony prominence peripheral nerve trunk , thereby avoid major surgical revision preserve limb length . The investigator hypothesize enrich fat graft autologous adipose stromal cell , regenerative medicine approach , lead improve retention fat graft time result favorable outcome . The Investigators evaluate : 1 . Treatment painful amputation sit 5 patient fat grafting , intend provide additional subcutaneous tissue pad bony structure nerve trunk . Limb anatomy heal graft time , along stability/persistence new tissue , assess high resolution CT scan 3D reconstruction . Patients follow 24 month treatment define long term outcome . Patients enrol pain amputation site limit function and/or interferes ability use prosthesis . 2 . Biologic property cell within fat graft correlate clinical outcome . This include adipose stem cell yield per volume fat tissue , cell proliferation , capacity adipogenic differentiation , lipolysis , cell sub-population analysis multiparameter flow cytometry . Results assay correlate graft volume retention search predictor good clinical outcome relate variation adipose biology subject . 3 . Quality life measurement patient autologous fat graft use validated psychosocial measure . This include SF 36 , Beck inventory , instrument design assess limb function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic amputation prevalent pose many challenge wound warrior . A recent publication report current conflict , 950 military personnel sustain combat-related amputation , 15 % occur 12 week initial injury ( 1 ) . Updated statistic place number amputee 1050 ( personal communication , COL Paul Pasquina , Chief Integrated Department Orthopaedics Rehabilitation , Walter Reed National Military Medical Center-WRNMMC ) . The ability wound warrior gain optimal function amputation often depend ability successfully fit adapt prosthesis . Once acute phase , many patient amputation suffer pain wear prosthesis , either thin soft tissue cover bony structure peripheral nerve well pad soft tissue . Extrinsic residual limb pain usually mechanical origin relate prosthetic socket prosthetic component . It often result mismatch residual limb tissue tolerance prosthetic load soft tissue . This sensitivity often accentuate superficial nerve trunk neuromas sever nerve expose excessive external mechanical loading ( 2 ) . Poor socket interface , secondary skin breakdown , and/or pain may severely limit function . This present difficult clinical problem historically , possible , clinical procedure would involve surgical revision amputation site associate shorten bone , lengthy scar , prolong healing . If knee amputation convert knee level , serious functional implication . For local tissue amputation site poor quality ( e.g . scar covered skin graft ) , distant muscle flap may require ( 3,4 ) . These flap may require transfer amputation site use microvascular anastomosis blood vessel . The procedure highly invasive add morbidity decrease function , deformity , risk wind heal problem muscle donor site . Failure rate low limb flap high 18.5 % ( 5 , 6 ) . Flap ulceration rate tend high weight-bearing flap , skin muscle free flap frequently need secondary debulking procedure improve function , painful neuromas uncommon ( 6,7 ) . A clinical solution allow minimally invasive generation new soft tissue pad amputation site without need limb shortening , lengthy scar , prolonged recovery , significant donor site morbidity would potential significantly help wounded warrior change clinical practice . Autologous fat graft potential solution . Grafting autologous fat tissue minimally invasive surgical technique start harvest fat tissue abdomen thighs use liposuction incision less 5mm length . The lipoaspirate process concentrate adipose fraction reinjected donor site . This surgical procedure involve immediate transplantation patient 's tissue single operative procedure . It advantage : - Minimal access incision - Ability transfer significant amount tissue ( hundred grams tissue ) - Can use set previous surgical procedure presence hardware - Usually perform outpatient procedure - Minimal donor site morbidity graft harvest site - Low risk compare invasive surgical procedure - Can repeat multiple time , necessary , even use donor sit The transfer autologous tissue new concept another method see many type flap use various combination muscle , fat skin well document . Tissue flap come many different location , use many different way accomplish desire result . Flaps blood supply , resilient skin graft , usually produce much good result cosmetic standpoint provide good match skin tone texture . Skin flap also better choice tissue `` bulk '' need fill contour defect . The obvious advantage use autologus tissue versus xenograft allograft ; know risk rejection adverse event . The literature unequivocally demonstrate clinical fat graft buttock ( similar weight-bearing anatomic region ) perform safely effectively retention rate approximate 75 % 2 year beyond ( 23-25 ) . In OVID database search fat grafting article , 9000 article reference use fat graft wide arena clinical situation . Specifically application 100 reference relevant proposal provide . ( 26-132 ) The investigator propose clinical trial ass efficacy minimally invasive autologous fat transfer address pain poor prosthetic fit amputation sit . This surgical procedure involve immediate transplantation subject 's tissue require FDA oversight . Importantly , use knowledge expertise work adipose stromal cell compare regenerative medicine cell therapy modification fat graft procedure traditional fat graft preparation . The big problem associate fat graft unpredictable rate fat graft resorption . This likely related ability regenerate adipose tissue rapidly develop new blood supply . In study , test regenerative medicine approach enrich adipose graft autologous adipose stem cell ( stromal cell enrich adipose graft ) . This may serve improve graft retention time potentially improve functional outcome . A modified preparation fat graft involve concentrate endogenous stromal cell graft material effort increase graft retention time . The aspirated fat material use fat graft consist mature adipocytes , small amount fibrous tissue , immature adipose stromal cell ( ASCs ) . These adipose stromal cell mixed population non-lipid laden cell serve turn mature adipocytes vascular element . `` Preadipocytes , '' well endothelial precursor cell multilineage progenitor cell , find . Of note , ASCs show stimulate angiogenesis stress hypoxic condition cell may instrumental healing volume retention fat graft . Yoshimura , et . al . ( 133 ) find fat aspirate liposuction cannula ( i.e . method fat harvest fat graft ) deficient ASCs compare whole fat . This due fact major portion ASCs locate around large blood vessel leave intact donor site liposuction blunt cannula . The relative lack ASCs lipoaspirate may explain problem fat graft reabsorption time . Enriching lipoaspirate ASCs increase angiogenesis , therefore , fat graft retention . This cell therapy approach take advantage innate ability ASC 's secrete angiogenic factor also differentiate mature adipocytes . The improved blood vessel ingrowth result improve graft volume retention superior reconstructive outcome . Our group University Pittsburgh develop clinically useful scalable GMP method ASC extraction NIH fund program , lead Dr. Rubin ( Co-Director Adipose Stem Cell Center ) collaboration Dr. Albert Donnenberg , director clinical laboratory cell process . We currently start fully fund project Armed Forces Regenerative Medicine ( AFIRM ) . We utilizing extraction technique perform ASC enrich fat graft facial trauma reconstruction receive IRB approval institution . This process regulate human cell , tissue cellular tissue-based product ( HCT/P ) guideline section 361 CFR ( 21CFR1271.10 ) . HCT/P therapy exempt requirement submission Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application . For project proposal , expand team encompass expertise reconstructive fat grafting , low extremity reconstruction , physical medicine rehabilitation , prosthetic design , nutritional support , evaluation psychosocial outcome . Given initial success autologous fat graft facial reconstruction trauma ( analysis ongoing ) , even without enrichment graft adipose stromal cell , believe therapy effectively apply treatment limb pain . This procedure perform outpatient basis significant incision limb , small port site measure less 5 mm . It note completely new , experimental application conventional treatment .</detailed_description>
