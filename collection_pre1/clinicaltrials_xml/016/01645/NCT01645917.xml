	<brief_title>Durability Pulmonary Vein Isolation Following Cryoablation Treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia encounter clinical practice . It estimate 7 million people worldwide disease . Over past decade , catheter ablation become accept treatment patient AF . Ablation strategies target pulmonary vein consider cornerstone treatment . The innovative Arctic Front cryoballoon use treatment drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal AF ( PAF ) . The system design overcome many challenge point-by-point catheter ablation provide anatomical approach pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) , create long contiguous circumferential lesion surround pulmonary vein . The cryoballoon system low risk complication prove efficacy treat PAF . AF recurrence rate report 30 % initial ablation PVI technology include point-by-point RF catheter ablation . Arrhythmia recurrence cause non-contiguous ablation line allow conduction gap . Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter ( Arctic Front Advance ) , second-generation cryoballoon recently introduce following clearance regulatory agency US EU , position address challenge PVI technology . The new catheter feature EvenCool™ Cryo Technology , optimize refrigerant distribute inside balloon , provide uniform , distal cool around circumference balloon . The purpose study examine rate electrical PV isolation next generation system .</detailed_description>
