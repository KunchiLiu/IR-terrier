	<detailed_description>Aims Objectives The study aim develop , design pilot mHealth intervention strengthen CF component ICDS programme . Specific objective seek : 1.1 . Exploring caregiver , AWWs relevant ICDS personnel 's view feasibility , acceptability best mean use mobile phone facilitate process deliver CF counsel within ICDS programme . 1.2 . Designing context-specific , relevant sustainable mHealth intervention strengthen CF component ICDS programme base exist evidence view caregiver , AWWs relevant ICDS personnel . 1.3 . Pilot test refine mHealth intervention . Study design It anticipate mHealth intervention might potentially strengthen CF component ICDS programme . Accordingly , qualitative quantitative strategy use develop , design pilot mHealth intervention endeavour address follow three barrier within ICDS programme : ( ) inadequate feeding practice , ( ii ) target child 3 year age , ( iii ) poor AWW supervision unmanageable workload . Focus group discussion ( FGDs ) in-depth interview ( IDIs ) conduct study site AWWs , relevant ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers child age 9-11 month assess feasibility , acceptability best mean use mobile phone facilitate process deliver CF counsel improve AWW supervision workload . Any change infant diet also assess use 24-hour dietary recall . This infant age group select since 9-11 month old infant likely demonstrate great nutritional benefit compare old child , establish CF intake younger age group ( e.g . 6-8 month ) likely transition eat complementary food . Socio-demographic questionnaire also administer AWWs , ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers descriptive data . Findings present intervention design workshop develop mHealth intervention , pilot test refine . Mixed-methods research recommend explore complex intervention . Accordingly , quantitative qualitative method use address study objective . The study use wide range respondent gain broad understand current behaviour , identify key influencers understand facilitator barrier behaviour change different perspective . Sample size determine saturation sampling , , continue investigate new information uncover . Sampling strategy AWWs , relevant ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers child age 9-11 month purposively select study area . Criterion selection participant involve nutrition counsel within ICDS programme . Sampling purposive research team aim inclusiveness , representativeness . The number FGDs IDIs depend number require reach data saturation i.e. , repeat new material theme emerge . The characteristic AWWs relevant ICDS personnel FGDs IDIs reflect diversity breadth potential AWWs relevant ICDS personnel involve promotion nutrition message . The characteristic mothers/caregivers FGDs IDIs also reflect diversity breadth potential mothers/caregivers receive nutrition message . Methods Objective 1.1 : Assessing feasibility , acceptability best mean use mobile phone CF counsel FGD 1.1.1 FGD 1.1.2 take place train facilitator person transcription fluency local language ( ) . AWWs , relevant ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers answer question feasibility , acceptability best way use mobile phone facilitate process deliver CF counsel within ICDS programme . Open-ended question ask , follow specific prompt relate research question . FGDs record digital recorder . QQ 1.1.1 , QQ 1.2.2 QQ 1.2.3 translate local language need . Mothers/caregivers answer interviewer-administered questionnaire socio-demographic information . Questions mobile phone also ask trained interviewer fluency local language ( ) inform Study 2 . AWWs relevant ICDS personnel answer self-administered questionnaire mobile phone use , professional experience socio-demographic information . Objective 1.2 : Designing mHealth intervention strengthen CF component ICDS programme Data potential usage mobile phone within ICDS system present intervention development workshop stakeholder relevant expert review finding formative research make decision mHealth intervention 's content structure . Outputs include : - Behaviour change strategy - mHealth intervention strategy component , include target - Conceptual framework intervention Intervention material include manual , protocol creative brief write need intervention design workshop . Relevant intervention component also try prior pilot intervention . It note outcome workshop entirely evidence-driven ; , detail provide potential design mHealth intervention data FGDs AWWs , relevant ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers collect analysed . Objective 1.3 : Pilot test refine mHealth intervention The mHealth intervention pilot test refined relevant ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers order test operational element select developed intervention design workshop . This pilot study purposively select participant - mothers/caregivers , AWWs and/or relevant ICDS personnel depend intervention design - study site pilot test intervention . AWWs train counsel message prior implement pilot test mobile phone . The pilot test take place 6 week approximately 72 purposively select participant . Any change infant diet measure administer mothers/caregivers pilot study pilot study . Process evaluation tool also use measure context , fidelity protocol , dose , facilitator barrier implementation . At end pilot test period , IDIs use study participant collect data follow indicator : - Feasibility ( include frequency timing message and/or phone call ) - Acceptability - Comprehensibility - Tone message - Barriers - Facilitating factor - Modifications The number IDIs depend number require reach data saturation i.e. , repeat new material theme emerge . Participant characteristic IDIs reflect diversity breadth study participant recruit test mobile phone pilot study . QQs also use study participant collect socio-demographic information . Interviewer-administered QQs use mothers/caregivers part study due low literacy rate propose study site . These data collect aim describing success challenge implement mHealth intervention setting , may potentially use within ICDS programme setting deliver complementary feed counsel . They use refine mHealth intervention . Detailed protocol include sample strategy , QQs form collect data finalise context-specific mHealth intervention develop intervention design workshop . Data Analysis Quantitative data analysis Quantitative data collection method study include QQs 24-hour recall . All quantitative data double-entered data entry error identify use range consistency check . After data clean , transfer STATA 11 software analysis . Dietary data analyse specific diet program develop use Microsoft Excel . Categories generate continuous variable need . Data analyse represent use numerical , graphical tabular method . In order estimate change infant diet FBRs test mothers/caregivers ( Objective 1.3 ) , pair t-tests use identify difference mean 95 % CIs dietary outcome . Differences consider significant P &lt; 0.05 . Statistics use descriptive purpose , i.e . study population represent proportion , mean , etc . dietary data pilot test represent mean standard deviation . Qualitative data analysis The study rely heavily FGDs , IDIs structure observation various stage insight develop , implement , evaluate mHealth intervention . Qualitative analysis iterative , thus evolve alongside data collection . NVivo 8 software use store code FGD IDI transcript translate English . Contents FGD IDI transcript identify range ICDS personnel mothers/caregivers ' reaction FBRs use mobile phone nutrition counsel . A thematic approach use code FDGs IDIs , start initial free cod ultimate aim categorize theme category . In part , code base predetermine theme emerge literature review nutrition counsel intervention current state ICDS programme India . This process use ground theory approach , cod entirely inductive.11 However , qualitative data cod allow emergence new unanticipated theme influence pre-conceptualised framework . Triangulation data important establish reliability data . 12 Accordingly , data FGDs IDIs compare checked inconsistency completeness . Doing help student ascertain `` correct '' interpretation data . All conclusion present key study staff accuracy improve reliability .</detailed_description>
