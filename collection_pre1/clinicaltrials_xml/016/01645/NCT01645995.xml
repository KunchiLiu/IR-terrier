In addition perceive impact sugar consumption weight control , high sugar intake , specifically sucrose fructose , implicated increase plasma lipids marker insulin resistance . However date randomise control study investigate whether consumption reformulate low sugar product component habitual diet significant impact plasma lipid , insulin glucose concentration within free-living , non-diseased population . It hypothesise exchange reformulate , low sugar food product habitually consume food result dietary compensation minimal weight change compare unmodified product little impact plasma glucose , insulin lipid level .</brief_summary>
