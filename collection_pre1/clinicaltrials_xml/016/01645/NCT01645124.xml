	<detailed_description>Polycythemia vera ( PV ) chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterize clonal proliferation hematopoietic progenitor result expansion erythrocyte mass , clinical course affect cardiovascular event , main cause morbidity mortality . Arterial thrombotic event predominant , particularly large vessel arterial event include cerebrovascular accident , myocardial infarction , peripheral arterial occlusion . Based complex relationship thrombosis , hematocrit , parameter tissue perfusion blood viscosity , latter prove exponential function hematocrit . Red cell aggregation increase high hematocrit ( HCT ) level , create potential vascular stasis . As result , enhance interplay platelet , leukocytes vessel wall increase risk thrombosis . Considering lack effective therapeutic strategy target mutate allele JAK2V617F , know treatment eradicate abnormal clone , apart anecdotal case bone marrow transplantation . Cytoreductive treatment phlebotomy chemotherapy , however , dramatically reduce number thrombotic complication substantially improve survival today agreement goal cytoreductive treatment keep HCT value 0.45 PV patient . This suggested basis small , retrospective study PV 30 year ago show progressive increase incidence vascular occlusive episode HCT level higher 44 % patient treat accord drug therapeutic tenet time . However clinical trial confirm finding . The result two large prospective study currently available ( namely PVSG-1 ECLAP ) suggest difference risk thrombosis among patient keep HCT 50 % . An association relevant outcome event ( namely . thrombotic event , mortality , haematological progression ) HCT evaluable range 40-55 % find ECLAP population neither multivariate analysis baseline time-dependent multivariate analysis . The ECLAP trial demonstrate antithrombotic efficacy low-dose aspirin set use therapy clinical practice likely decrease meaningfully , though eliminate , high risk thrombosis PV patient . In conclusion , high incidence thrombotic event irrespective low-dose aspirin administration well haematological transformation long term show PV patient study suggest need investigate depth benefit/risk profile current therapeutic option cytoreductive therapy . CYTO-PV aim assess benefit risk profile cytoreductive therapy phlebotomy and/or HU aim maintain HCT &lt; 45 % Vs. maintaining HCT range 45-50 % . It independent , investigator-generated pragmatic trial broad selection criterion mimic clinical practice order strengthen transferability result population PV patient ; design conduct , without need special facility , framework Italian Group hematologic Adult diseases ( `` GIMEMA '' ) . The optimization therapeutic management PV patient allow improve prognosis PV patient , allocation resource Italian National Health Service ( IHS ) , knowledge benefit/risk profile pharmacological cytoreduction PV</detailed_description>
