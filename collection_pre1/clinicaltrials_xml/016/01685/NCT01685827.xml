	<brief_summary>This clinical trial design prove efficacy safety Fexinidazole oral treatment human african trypanosomiasis advance stage . The Fexinidazole compare reference treatment NECT . The trial try demonstrate Fexinidazole inferior NECT treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pivotal Study Fexinidazole Human African Trypanosomiasis Stage 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) life-threatening neglected disease . Few treatment option currently available stage 2 ( meningo-encephalitic stage ) HAT , NECT commonly use one since 2010 . Though NECT represent significant improvement current therapy , still far ideal give environment HAT patient live ( remote , poor area little health infrastructure , , difficult logistics ) . There urgent need less toxic easily manageable compound treat fatal disease . Fexinidazole 2-5-nitroimidazole , formulated oral administration , show posse vitro vivo activity T. b. rhodesiense T. b. gambiense parasite . Predicted CSF concentration reach target level repeat dosing . Its efficacy safety must test patient stage 2 HAT .</detailed_description>
