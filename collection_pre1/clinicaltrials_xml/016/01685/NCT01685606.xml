	<brief_title>Study Infusion Blood Cells ( Lymphocytes ) Stimulate Immune System Fight Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There important advance modulation immune system treatment hematologic malignancy solid tumor . This protocol build upon previous observation follow : - Haploidentical peripheral blood pheresed cell use 1-2x108 CD3 cells/kg . - Total body radiation utilized . - This modification may effectively activate recipient 's immune system attack hematological malignancy damage recipient 's immune cell prior cellular infusion . Safety improve since risk graft versus host disease greatly reduce host 's immune system condition . - Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) priming use . - In first clinical trial , G-CSF priming use matched transplant . Our second trial employ G-CSF prim haplo-identical setting . Previous data cite role G-CSF stimulation invariant Natural Killer ( NK ) cell enhance GVL effects11 . However , recent laboratory data unprimed PBMC show effective cell kill activity without addition G-CSF . As G-CSF would administer healthy volunteer , unclear benefit addition cytokine offset potential side effect headache , fever , bone pain . G-CSF mobilization serve shift response TH1 TH2 increase production T regulatory cell . The end result would decrease immune stimulation . Since goal study NOT engraftment , manipulation donor cell dampen host versus tumor stimulation need desire . Furthermore , since protocol stem cell transplant , stem cell need mobilize G-CSF . It important note propose study stem cell transplant study . In situation stem cell transplant , goal procedure engraftment , sustainable donor chimerism marrow provide hematopoietic reconstitution well immunologic reconstitution . In study , evaluate use donor lymphocyte ( stem cell ) stimulate immune response recipient ' immune system .</detailed_description>
