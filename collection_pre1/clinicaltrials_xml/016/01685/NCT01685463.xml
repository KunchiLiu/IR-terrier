	<brief_summary>Specific Primary Aims include : Aim # 1 . The investigator explore feasibility use TMS investigate cortical excitability inhibit meth cue crave meth dependent population . The investigator anticipate meth elevate cortical excitability measure motor threshold , cause change cortical silent period , RC . The investigator also anticipate paired pulse measure ( short-interval intracortical inhibition , short-interval intracortical facilitation long-interval intracortical inhibition ) different healthy control , directly link glutamatergic cortical facilitation GABAergic inhibition , respectively . Aim # 2 . Given change cortical excitability meth user , investigator use inhibit TMS ( 1 Hz ) medial prefrontal cortex study whether TMS use reduce cue craving . The investigator hypothesize repetitive TMS reduce meth cue crave meth dependent population compare sham rTMS .</brief_summary>
