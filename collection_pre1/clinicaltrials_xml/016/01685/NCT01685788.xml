	<brief_summary>The overall aim project gain insight sensory deficit recovery pattern upper limb post stroke association brain lesion localisation . Furthermore , investigator identify association deficit sensory modality upper limb impairment , activity participation different time point stroke . Identification sensory deficit , along insight relation objective neurophysiological neuroanatomical measure contribute amelioration goal-setting rehabilitation upper extremity function stroke . These function indispensable several daily activity well different sport leisure activity . This project important step towards well delineate treatment intervention upper limb well guide individual need post-stroke treatment future .</brief_summary>
