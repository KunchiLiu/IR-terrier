	<brief_title>A Phase 3 , Open-label Study Safety Effectiveness AA4500 Administered Twice Per Treatment Cycle Four Treatment Cycles ( 2 x 4 ) Men With Peyronie 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After final injection treatment cycle , investigator qualify designee ( ie , qualified license , education , train perform study procedure accord local , state , country requirement ) model plaque attempt stretch elongate plaque . If subject 's penile curvature reduce &lt; 15° first , second , third cycle injection investigator determines treatment clinically indicate ( eg , adverse event ; allergic reaction ) , subsequent treatment cycle administer . Following maximum four treatment cycle , subject follow additional safety efficacy assessment Days 168 ( ± 7 day ) 252 ( ± 7 day ) ( nominal week 24 36 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>No subject enrol eligibility criterion satisfy . Subjects complete participation Auxiliumsponsored study AUXCC803 AUXCC804 receive placebo study may enroll study provide continue meet eligibility requirement . To qualify study subject must : 1 . Have penile curvature least 30° dorsal , lateral , dorsal/lateral plane screening . It must possible delineate single plane maximal curvature evaluation study 2 . Be judge good health , base upon result medical history , physical examination , laboratory profile 3 . Have participate Study AUXCC803 Study AUXCC804 , receive placebo study , complete study 4 . Voluntarily sign date inform consent agreement approve Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) . The subject must also sign authorization form allow disclosure protect health information ( PHI ) .

A subject exclude study participation : 1 . Has penile curvature le 30° great 90° screen visit 2 . Has follow condition : Chordee presence absence hypospadias Thrombosis dorsal penile artery and/or vein Infiltration benign malignant mass result penile curvature Infiltration infectious agent , lymphogranuloma venereum Ventral curvature cause Presence active sexually transmitted disease Known active hepatitis B C Known immune deficiency disease positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 3 . Has previously undergone surgery Peyronie 's disease 4 . Fails erection opinion investigator sufficient accurately measure subject 's penile deformity administration prostaglandin E1 trimix another suitable injectable pharmacologic stimulant accord standard practice investigator 's institution 5 . Has calcify plaque evident appropriate radiographic evaluation , penile xray penile ultrasound would prevent proper injection study medication . Noncontiguous stipple calcium acceptable inclusion provide calcium deposit interfere injection AA4500 plaque 6 . Has isolate hourglass deformity penis 7 . Has plaque cause curvature penis locate proximal base penis , injection local anesthetic would interfere injection AA4500 plaque 8 . Has previously receive alternative medical therapy Peyronie 's disease administer intralesional route ( include , limited , steroid , verapamil , naturally occur low molecular weight protein , interferonα2b ) within 3 month first dose study drug plan use medical therapy time study 9 . Has receive alternative medical therapy Peyronie 's disease administer oral ( include , limited , vitamin E [ &gt; 500 U ] , potassium aminobenzoate [ Potaba ] , tamoxifen , colchicine , pentoxifylline , , ) topical route ( include , limited , verapamil apply cream ) within 3 month first dose study drug plan use medical therapy time study 10 . Has extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) correction Peyronie 's disease within 6month period screen plan ESWT time study 11 . Has use mechanical type device correction Peyronie 's disease within 2week period screen plan use device time study 12 . Has use mechanical device induce passive erection within 2week period screen plan use device time study 13 . Has significant erectile dysfunction fail respond oral treatment phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitors 14 . Has penile Duplex Doppler ultrasound evaluation screening show compromise penile hemodynamics opinion investigator clinically significant 15 . Has uncontrolled hypertension , determine investigator 16 . Has know recent history stroke , bleeding , significant medical condition , investigator 's opinion would make subject unsuitable enrollment study 17 .
