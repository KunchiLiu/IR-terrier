	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease rare lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( GCB ) . Due deficiency functional GCB , glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophage lead cellular engorgement , organomegaly , organ system dysfunction . Gaucher disease classify 3 clinical subtypes base presence absence neurological symptom severity neurological symptom . Patients type 2 Gaucher disease present acute neurological deterioration , type 3 Gaucher disease typically display sub acute neurological course ; type 1 Gaucher disease , common form accounting 90 % case , involve central nervous system . Velaglucerase alfa approve enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) pediatric adult patient type 1 Gaucher disease . ERTs proven reduce organomegaly , improve hematological parameter positively impact health-related quality life ; ERTs show cross blood brain barrier result show limited ability improve neurological ( Central Nervous System ; CNS ) manifestation associate Gaucher disease . This study provide basis explore efficacy safety velaglucerase alfa patient type 3 Gaucher disease .</detailed_description>
