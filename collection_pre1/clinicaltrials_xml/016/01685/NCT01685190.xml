	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common male cancer UK 35,000 case diagnose annually . 35 % locally advanced disease . These patient high chance pelvic lymph node involvement relatively poor prostate cancer survival rate 22.5 % 10 year . One standard treatment patient radiotherapy prostate . PIVOTAL multi-centre phase II non-comparative randomise feasibility trial , patient high chance pelvic lymph node involvement randomise prostate radiotherapy alone prostate + pelvic radiotherapy . Both group receive radiotherapy call Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) . This relatively new method shape radiotherapy treatment beam allow tumour treated precisely , whilst avoid surround normal , healthy tissue ( particularly rectum , bladder bowel ) . Using IMRT , possible deliver high dos radiotherapy pelvis previous radiotherapy method - test single hospital , single group set level side effect ( toxicity ) acceptable . PIVOTAL aim find whether toxicity level 18 week start radiotherapy remain acceptable treatment give multiple cancer centre across UK . It randomise ensure unbiased collection acute toxicity data provide information patient ' willingness participate randomise study . Should phase II study successful , investigator would develop phase III trial compare treatment effectiveness ( disease control ) . Patients enter PIVOTAL follow two year start radiotherapy data relate toxicity collect . They also ask complete patient relate symptoms questionnaire . Data related disease recurrence collect annually patient ' standard hospital visit .</brief_summary>

National Collaborative Cancer Network locally advance disease ( T3b± T4 ) 43 : • Estimated risk pelvic lymph node involvement ≥30 % * either : Gleason 9 10 Gleason 8 one high risk feature ( T3± disease PSA &gt; 20 ) Gleason 7 2 high risk feature ( T3± disease PSA ≥30 ) 3. WHO performance status 0 1 4 . Normal blood count ( Hb &gt; 11g/dl , WBC &gt; 4000/mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 ) 5 . LHRH analogue therapy 69 month duration prior propose radiotherapy treatment PSA &lt; 4ng/ml prior randomisation . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year 7 . Patients must prepare attend follow . All patient participate Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) Study must adequate cognitive ability complete PRO questionnaire . 8 . Written inform consent T3a disease demonstrate convincingly , either clinically MRI . T3b disease ( seminal vesicle involvement ) must convincingly demonstrate MR. Risk pelvic lymph node involvement = ( Gleason score 6 ) x 10 + 2/3 PSA Exclusion criterion : 1 . Prior pelvic radiotherapy 2 . Prior major pelvic surgery ( e.g . colectomy , colostomy , cystectomy , prostatectomy ) * 3 . Radiologically suspicious ( short axis diameter ≥1.0cm unless biopsied negative ) pathologically confirm lymph node involvement 4 . Life expectancy &lt; 5 year 5 . Castrate resistant prostate cancer ( rise PSA LHRHa antiandrogen ) 6 . Previous active malignancy within last 5 year basal cell carcinoma 7 . Comorbid condition likely impact decision treat radiotherapy ( e.g . previous inflammatory bowel disease , previous colorectal surgery , significant bladder instability urinary incontinence ) 8 . Bilateral hip prosthesis fixation would interfere standard radiation beam configuration Patients undergone minor pelvic surgery eligible ( eg appendicectomy , trans urethral resection prostate ( TURP ) , exploratory laparoscopy , haemorrhoidectomy , inguinal/femoral hernia repair )</criteria>
