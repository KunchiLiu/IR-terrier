	<detailed_description>1 . Retrospective study : We collect data Korean patient RA retrospectively . Subjects extract medical record RA patient treat TNF inhibitor currently use TNF inhibitor . Patients receive receive biologic agent include infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , rituximab Dec.2000 Dec.2010 enrol . Data study sex , date birth , previous current medication , result laboratory test , disease activity RA ( DAS28ESR ) , comorbidity collect . Information treatment , DAS28ESR , laboratory data SAEs collect baseline predefined time point follow-up ( 0 , 3 month recent follow-up data ) . During first year start study , focus evaluate tolerability , reason discontinuation elderly RA patient retrospective study . Tolerance could analyze examine drug persistency biologic DMARDs reason lead drug interruption , drug persistency curve compare two group . The length time patient remain drug therapy represent useful measure treatment effectiveness tolerability . The reason discontinuation evaluate descriptive analysis . And factor influence drug discontinuation elderly RA patient young RA patient use Cox-proportional analysis . 2 . Prospectively study : We use data patient Hanyang University Hospital Rheumatic Diseases web-based registry RA patient biologic DMARDs . Patients start receive biologic agent include infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , rituximab , abatacept enrol . At registration , sex , date birth , previous current medication , result laboratory test , disease activity RA ( DAS28ESR ) , HAQ , comorbidity , socioeconomic status , etc . collect . Information treatment , DAS28ESR , HAQ , laboratory data SAEs , etc . collect baseline predefined time point follow-up ( 0 , 3 month every 6 month ) . This prospective study progress three year . We focus response biologic DMARDs occurrence adverse event elderly RA patient prospective study . The response could evaluate change DAS28ESR functional disability ( HAQ ) . We compare response elderly RA patient versus young RA patient , evaluate impact old age response use multiple logistic regression model adjust various confound factor . The occurrence adverse event three year describe two group</detailed_description>
