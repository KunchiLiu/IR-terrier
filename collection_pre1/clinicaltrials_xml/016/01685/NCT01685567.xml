	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain establish safety efficacy The MICHI™ Neuroprotection System Filter ( MICHI™ NPS+f ) provide cerebral embolic protection angioplasty stenting procedure carotid artery . The MICHI NPS+f also facilitate access carotid neuro anatomy introduction therapeutic diagnostic endovascular device and/or agent . It use conjunction FDA approve carotid artery stent treatment carotid artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Reverse Flow Used During Carotid Artery Stenting Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral embolization carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) often precipitate severe adverse neurological effect . Most major clinical study CAS use distal filter cerebral protection compare neurologic complication rate carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) . Many currently available embolic protection device , however , limited efficacy capture microembolic debris liberate stenting , pre-dilatation post-dilatation . Distal protection system furthermore limited need cross lesion prior deployment . Some study show relatively high incidence cerebral infarction even distal protection device employ . Cerebral protection carotid flow reversal method develop alternative use distal protection device . While novel approach , method limitation . Another technique develop employ carotid flow reversal prior traverse stenosis accomplish directly access carotid anatomy without use transfemoral approach . Major benefit method include simple route target lesion ability perform procedure patient severe carotid tortuosity difficult aortic arch anatomy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must meet one follow criterion regard neurological symptom status degree stenosis : Symptomatic : Stenosis must great equal 50 % determined angiogram patient history stroke ( minor nondisabling ) , TIA and/or amaurosis fugax within 180 day procedure . Asymptomatic : Stenosis must great equal 70 % determine angiogram without neurological symptom within prior 180 day . 2 . Target vessel must meet diameter requirement stent ( refer select stent IFU diameter requirement ) . 3 . Patient discrete lesion locate internal carotid artery ( ICA ) without involvement contiguous common carotid artery ( CCA ) . 4 . Patient great equal 18 year age . 5 . Patient childbearing potential negative pregnancy test within one week prior study procedure . 6 .

Patient history intolerance allergic reaction study medication stent material ( refer stent IFU ) , include aspirin ( ASA ) , ticlopidine , clopidogrel , prasugrel , statin contrast medium ( ca n't pre medicate ) . Patients must able tolerate statin combination ASA ticlopidine , ASA clopidogrel ASA prasugrel . 13 . Myocardial Infarction within 72 hour prior intervention . 14 . Presence previous place intravascular stent target vessel plan arteriotomy site . 15 . Patient neurologic illness within past two year characterize fleeting fix neurologic deficit distinguish TIA stroke ( e.g . partial secondarily generalize seizure , complicate classic migraine , tumor spaceoccupying brain lesion , subdural hematoma , cerebral contusion posttraumatic lesion , intracranial infection , demyelinate disease , moderate severe dementia , intracranial hemorrhage ) . 16 . Patient history major stroke ( CVA retinal embolus ) major neurological deficit likely confound study endpoint within 1 month index procedure . 17 .
