	<brief_title>Evaluating Diagnostic Validity Inflammation-associated Markers Tuberculous Pleurisy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain global health problem even though nearly eradicate developed country . Because variable manifestation difficulty collect clinical sample , extra-pulmonary TB usually difficult early diagnose . Tuberculous pleurisy ( TP ) one common extra-pulmonary infection account approximately 5 % form TB . The gold standard diagnose TP mycobacterial culture pleural effusion ( PE ) , pleura tissue , require week yield . The treatment could thus delay , result increase mortality rate . In addition , mycobacterial culture sensitive PE positivity less two third case TB pleurisy . For diagnose TP , PE biomarkers require investigated addition traditional PE cell count biochemistry . In particularly , inflammation-associated cytokine apoptosis-associated marker may important two pathway involve TB infection/defense mechanism . For inflammation-association marker , current literature comprehensive except IFN-gamma IFN-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) . However , result IGRA use PE disappointed . We study PE inflammation marker IFN-induced protein-10 , interleukin [ IL ] -2 , IL-12 . On hand , apoptosis suppression one escape mechanisms TB pathogenesis . Macrophage , dendritic cell , neutrophil reportedly inhibited apoptosis TB infection . But apoptosis PE neutrophil rarely study . Moreover , role apoptosis-associated marker ( Fas ligand [ FasL ] , decoy receptor 3 , lipoxin , prostaglandin E2 , caspases ) PE rarely investigate diagnose TP except FasL . Therefore , conduct prospective study investigate inflammation/apoptosis-associated marker exudative PE apoptosis PE neutrophil analyze diagnostic usefulness TP .</detailed_description>
