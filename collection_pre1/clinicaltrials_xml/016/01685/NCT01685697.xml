	<brief_summary>Most premature baby difficulty breathe birth need help ( call resuscitation ) . The treatment gently inflate lung resuscitation device facemask . The device commonly use T-Piece infant resuscitator ( call T-Piece ) use The Royal Alexandra Hospital round world . To gentle inflate infant lung clinical team put face mask around baby 's mouth nose . The clinical team try achieve good seal face mask . A problem mask ventilation air escape mask face ( call mask leak ) . Currently , two different type facemasks ( `` Laerdal mask '' `` Fisher &amp; Paykel mask '' ) routinely use delivery room The Royal Alexandra Hospital . The purpose study find one facemask leak less face mask .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mask Ventilation With Different Face Masks During Neonatal Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We use Laerdal round mask ( Laerdal , Stavanger , Norway ) compare Fisher &amp; Paykel ( FP ) ( Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare , Auckland , New Zealand ) 'round ' neonatal resuscitation mask . The two point top hold Laerdal 'round ' mask rim hold Fisher &amp; Paykel mask . A Respiratory Function Monitor place face mask ventilation device . It use small ( dead space 1 mL ) flow sensor measure gas flow face mask . This signal automatically integrated provide inspire expired tidal volume . The difference equal leak face mask . It also calculate respiratory rate minute ventilation , measure spontaneous inspiration ventilation pressure . The signal airway flow , tidal volume , airway pressure , inspire oxygen concentration , temperature , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , heart rate digitise record 200Hz use Spectra physiological record program ( customised neonatal respiratory physiology program ) . We compare % mask leak within two face mask .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Preterm infant &lt; 32 week gestation born The Royal Alexandra Hospital require resuscitation delivery room record . Infants exclude final analysis congenital abnormality condition might adverse effect breathe ventilation , include : Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia . Infants also exclude parent refuse give consent study . Participants include first minute birth require mask ventilation poor respiratory effort . Data collect Hospital chart discharge around 40 week gestation .</criteria>
