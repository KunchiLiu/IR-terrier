	<brief_summary>Infantile hemangioma ( IH ) common benign vascular tumor pediatric population . The characteristic natural history tumor rapid growth first year life follow spontaneous involution . However , may cause cosmetic unacceptable . Early intervention superficial IH may help minimize risk residual aesthetic problem . Topical timolol , non selective beta-blocker , emerge treatment report efficacy safety treatment IH . However , report study case-series small study . This study prospective double-blind , randomized-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety 0.5 % timolol maleate solution treatment superficial IH . The patient treat topical timolol least 6 month instruct 4 time daily apply 1-2 drop timolol solution lesion rub entire lesion finger . Photographs lesion take baseline every 1-month visit . Clinical evaluation treatment efficacy carry 2 investigator independently determine change lesion size visual analogue scale lesion color . The main outcome evaluate efficacy 0.5 % timolol maleate solution treatment infantile hemangioma compare placebo .</brief_summary>
