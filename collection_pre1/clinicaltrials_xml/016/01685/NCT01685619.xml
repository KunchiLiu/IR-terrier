	<brief_summary>This clinical study provide study specimen ( sample bone marrow blood ) clinical data pan-Canadian collaborative research project develop MDS/AML Research Consortium . The goal project involve evaluation potential validation five novel prognostic test myelodysplasia ( MDS ) and/or acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , well analysis health economic socio-ethical implication relate potential introduction test clinical setting . The over-arching goal improve outcome patient MDS AML . The primary hypothesis one laboratory test evaluate conjunction study , either alone combination laboratory test ( either establish investigation project ) , statistically significant prognostic value either alone combination establish clinical risk factor . The clinical study involve enrollment 200 adult AML 200 adult MDS 2.5 year period . Participants follow study two year . Bone marrow blood specimen collect diagnosis time point require development five laboratory test . Participants assign treatment accord local institutional practice follow 2 year . Health economic quality life questionnaire administer key time point . Data collect regard participant characteristic , diagnosis , disease feature , treatment clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two test involve technology call flow cytometry . Both flow cytometry test use predict whether person likely good response chemotherapy . Three test involve new genetic-based technology . One test call comparative genomic profiling . This test detect genetic abnormality current test method able detect . Another test involve micro-RNA profiling . The final test involve RNA sequencing . The researcher think test might useful predict well person respond treatment . The novel laboratory test evaluate part study still early phase development use clinical decision making . Participants enrol study inform regard individual result respect study test conduct use biospecimens . The following information ( data ) collect regard study participant : diagnosis , result relevant clinical test , age , gender , treatment outcome 2 year study follow-up period . The study also involve completion study questionnaires six different time point course two year study follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>There two part study : Part One ( Collection Biospecimens ) Part Two ( Two year followup include data collection regard treatment , outcome questionnaire completion ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA ( PART ONE ) : Prospective participant include study : The participant 18 year age older The participant suspect new diagnosis MDS ( include CMML ) , OR suspect new diagnosis AML exclude acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , OR know diagnosis MDS ( include CMML ) confirm bone marrow aspirate biopsy one year prior date enrollment AND without commencement definitive therapy prior enrollment The participant schedule diagnostic confirmatory bone marrow aspirate biopsy participate site , case prospective participant establish diagnosis MDS ( include CMML ) , must able undergo bone marrow aspirate study participate site The participant must able read and/or understand spoken English French eligible Part Two study The participant must able understand sign inform consent form applicable situation EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( PART ONE ) : Prospective participant exclude study : The participant already receive definitive therapy AML MDS The participant diagnosis MDS confirm one year prior date enrollment INCLUSION CRITERIA ( PART TWO ) : Participants enrol Part One eligible participate full two year study followup component meet follow criterion : Confirmed diagnosis either MDS , CMML AML ( exclude APL ) Sufficient cell count MDS/AML Clinical Study requirement follow : For participant suspect ( know ) AML : The blast count peripheral blood take diagnosis must great 1 x10^6 blast count/mL It must possible earmark MDS/AML Study : 3 vial 1.0 x 10^7/mL mononuclear peripheral blood cell 1 vial 0.5 x 10^7/mL mononuclear bone marrow cell Cells prepare accord site 's local cell bank procedure store transport study lab need . At site participate Hogge Assay : In addition specimen describe , must possible provide 2 mL fresh bone marrow 5 mL fresh peripheral blood &gt; 1 x 10^6 blast count/mL For participant suspect ( know ) MDS : It must possible earmark MDS/AML Study : 2 vial 1.0 x 10^7/mL mononuclear peripheral blood cell 2 vial 1.0 x 10^7/mL mononuclear bone marrow cell Cells prepare accord site 's local cell bank procedure store transport study lab need . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( PART TWO ) : Participants enrol Part One eligible participate full two year study followup component : Do sufficient cell count MDS/AML Clinical Study requirement set Section 11.3 It confirm enrollment diagnosis MDS , CMML AML A diagnosis APL confirm</criteria>
