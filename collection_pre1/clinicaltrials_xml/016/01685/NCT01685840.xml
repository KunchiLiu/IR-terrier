	<detailed_description>Heart failure common disorder heart pump enough blood meet need rest body . Common symptoms heart failure include shortness breath , swell , fatigue . Standard treatment heart failure include diuretic control fluid , well drug call `` neurohormonal antagonist '' ( beta-blockers ACE-inhibitors ) help heart work efficiently prevent worsen heart function . Typically , doctor adjust medicine base clinical judgment dos combination work best . We test whether use blood test call NT-proBNP ( measure hormone release heart ) help doctor well job adjust heart failure medicine time clinical judgment alone .</detailed_description>
