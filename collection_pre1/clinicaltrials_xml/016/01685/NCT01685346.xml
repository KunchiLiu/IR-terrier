	<brief_summary>This pilot study test hypothesis biofeedback-mediated stress management ( BFSM ) training use reduce distress enhance quality life patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Most patient advance NSCLC significant physical symptom , even physical symptom high level anxiety depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biofeedback Training Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biofeedback-mediated stress management ( BFSM ) involve help patient visualize reaction body stressful situation ( increased heart rate , increase skin conductance , increase muscle tension , decrease digital peripheral temperature , decreased heart rate variability ) teach control reaction , use standard stress management relaxation technique , couple computerized physiological feedback . The feedback help patient understand deep relaxation help body well mind . Several small study BFSM train cancer population successful help side effect chemotherapy radiation , effect BFSM distress quality life ( QOL ) , particularly NSCLC patient , study .</detailed_description>
