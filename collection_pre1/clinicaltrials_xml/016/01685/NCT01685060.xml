	<brief_title>LDK378 Adult Patients With ALK-activated NSCLC Previously Treated With Chemotherapy Crizotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , multicenter , phase II study efficacy safety LDK378 evaluate patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC harbor confirm ALK rearrangement , define 15 % positive tumor cell assess FDA-approved FISH test ( Abbott Molecular Inc. ) use Vysis break-apart probe . If documentation ALK rearrangement FDA-approved FISH test available , ALK test require inclusion study . If documentation available , new test ass ALK status FDA-approved Vysis ALK break-apart FISH test perform . Patients must pretreated cytotoxic chemotherapy ( 1 3 prior line , 1 must platinum doublet ) crizotinib . Patients may also receive first line treatment crizotinib follow cytotoxic chemotherapy , subsequently , rechallenge treatment crizotinib . Patients must demonstrate progression ( regardless initial response ) last crizotinib treatment , i.e . crizotinib regimen receive last therapy prior study entry . The study begin screen period ass eligibility , include 28 day prior first dose LDK378 . The treatment period begin Day 1 Cycle 1 . All patient treat LDK378 , administer orally , start dose 750 mg. A total approximately 137 patient enrol study . Patients take LDK378 daily , approximately time day . On day PK sample obtain , patient take LDK378 clinic visit instruct study staff . Treatment LDK378 continue patient experience unacceptable toxicity precludes treatment , discontinue treatment discretion patient investigator , start new anti-cancer therapy dy . If patient experience RECIST-defined progressive disease ( PD ) LDK378 assess investigator , treatment study drug may continue , judgment investigator , still evidence clinical benefit . These patient count PD ORR , DOR , DCR PFS calculation . Assessments tumor response progression perform every 8 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) , start first day treatment LDK378 . This schedule tumor assessment must continue regardless dose interruption . Tumor assessment continue : - For patient experience PD assess investigator , tumor assessment continue every 8 week LDK378 permanently discontinue ( i.e . patient continue treatment LDK378 PD , tumor assessment continue LDK378 permanently discontinue ) . - For patient discontinue treatment absence PD , tumor assessment continue every 8 week EOT visit PD assess investigator . Tumor evaluation always cease patient start new anti-cancer therapy , withdraws consent ( unless patient agrees continue efficacy assessment absence dose LDK378 ) , die . All tumor image assessment submit independent radiological assessment response Blinded Independent Review Committee ( BIRC ) . Clinical laboratory assessment perform . When patient discontinues study treatment End Treatment ( EOT ) visit must perform soon possible within 7 day last dose LDK378 . Patients contact safety follow-up 30 day last dose LDK378 determine experience new AEs and/or follow resolution ongoing AEs . Following end tumor assessment , Study Phase Completion Disposition eCRF must complete . Patients contact every 3 month obtain information pertain survival status death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent survival follow-up , end study . Patients need visit clinic survival follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion critieria : Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis stage IIIB IV NSCLC carry ALK rearrangement , per FDAapproved FISH assay ( Abbott Molecular Inc. ) . Age 18 year old time inform consent . Patients must NSCLC progressed therapy crizotinib within 30 day last dose Patients must receive 13 line cytotoxic chemotherapy ( 1 must platinum doublet ) treat locally advance metastatic NSCLC Patients must tumor tissue sample available , collect either time diagnosis NSCLC time since . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy grade â‰¤ 2 , except patient grade 2 nausea/vomiting and/or grade 2 diarrhea despite optimal supportive therapy allow participate study . Exclusion criterion : Patients know hypersensitivity excipients LDK378 . Patients symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid within 2 week prior study entry manage CNS symptom . History carcinomatous meningitis . Presence history malignant disease NSCLC diagnose and/or require therapy within past 3 year . Clinically significant , uncontrolled heart disease Systemic anticancer therapy give last dose crizotinib prior start study drug .</criteria>
