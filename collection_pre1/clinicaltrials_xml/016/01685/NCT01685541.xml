	<brief_summary>The electronic medical record ( EMR ) offer new method provide patient information visit clinician . The EMR generate personalize patient specific handout end visit recap topic cover visit . These After Visit Summaries ( AVS ) automatically generate information contain patient 's chart . The AVS potential improve patient retention information need adherence treatment plan , follow-up instruction , facilitate information transfer healthcare setting . However , content format AVS optimize patient ' information retention satisfaction visit know . In study , develop test randomize trial three different version AVS determine AVS content maximize patient satisfaction retention information AVS , adherence physician instruction . The three version AVS develop patient physician input compare control condition consist current practice setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct experiment four select primary care clinic test objectively effect three level AVS content patient recall personal visit information , satisfaction information receive provider , use information visit . The four clinic select provide diverse patient sample regard socioeconomic status , race/ethnicity language preference . The study plan total 68 patient AVS form group ( 272 total ) , 136 patient language group . In previous research SPUR-Net clinic , find difficult recruit Spanish-language preference individual private practice setting . The great majority person Hispanic ethnicity attend private practice clinic prefer communicate English . For reason , attempt recruit Spanish-speakers Baylor Family Medicine Clinic . Patients approach , agree participate consent study . At end visit , study patient randomize either control group one three experimental group . The RA accomplish opening seal envelope contains randomly generate group assignment . For experimental AVS 's , RA select generate appropriate study AVS Epic . For control group , AVS currently use clinic print distributed patient . All research subject contact 24 hour , 2-3 week study follow outcome . We able test control condition withholds AVS altogether , much JACHO standard govern participate clinic require AVS kind . Primary Outcome : The primary outcome measure amount information recall patient two time point : 2 day primary care visit , 2-3 week visit . The recall test consist two part . Part 1 involve recall general category information contain AVS . Sample question : - Did form information blood pressure ? - Did form information medication ? - Did form list health problem ? The response score correct incorrect , depend version AVS randomly assign patient . The final version recall test develop focus group analysis , final determination content three form AVS complete . Part 2 recall test ask patient generate list medication prescribe instruction give . This represent content minimum information AVS ( Form 3 ) , answer study participant . The patient ' answer record data base verbatim , completion data collection , investigator develop score rule assign score item . These rule account informal name medication ( `` water pill , '' `` sugar pill , '' etc. ) . The score part percent medication information correctly recall , include name pill ( formal informal ) , number dos take per day , time dose . The total test score percent item correctly recall . The two part analyze separately total score . Secondary Outcomes Patient Satisfaction AVS assess 9-item questionnaire adapt longer patient satisfaction scale develop researcher Baylor 's Department Family Community Medicine evaluate patient response educational material . Response option series question regard satisfaction various characteristic AVS range `` strongly agree '' `` strongly disagree . '' Two open end question provide patient opportunity mention element AVS , reaction , might anticipate research team . The form available English Spanish version . Adherence Treatment assess examine whether different AVS format influence patient ' self-reported adherence provider 's recommendation . We use general measure adherence summarize information patient 's tendency adhere medical recommendation , regardless type treatment recommend . The item measure : 1 . I hard time doctor suggest I ; 2 . I find easy thing doctor suggest I ; 3 . I unable necessary follow doctor 's treatment plan ; 4 . I follow doctor 's suggestion exactly ; 5 . Generally speak , often past 4 week able doctor tell ? Response option item range `` none time '' `` time . '' The general adherence scale construct average response five item transform result linearly 0-100 distribution . This scale , develop conjunction Health Outcomes Study , demonstrate good internal reliability approach .80 , acceptable stability time . Standard back translation procedure use construct equivalent Spanish version . Other Study Variables Health Literacy assess Short Test Functional Health Literacy Adults ( S-TOFHLA ) order account effect functional health literacy response AVS . Patients ' health literacy skill increasingly recognize critical variable primary care research . The S-TOFHLA time read comprehension test measure patient ' ability read understand passage describe common medical instruction . It available English Spanish version , take approximately 7 minute patient complete , score scale 0 36 . Patients categorized adequate health literacy S-TOFHLA score 23-36 , marginal health literacy 17-22 , inadequate health literacy score 0-16 . Demographic Health variable collect , include standard variable age , sex , race/ethnicity , number year education complete . In order adjust analyse disease severity , document total number health problem include patient 's problem list day study visit . In addition , salience AVS may relate presence absence acute condition , classify visit whether problem list visit include chronic condition , acute condition , combination acute chronic problem . This categorical variable include covariate outcome analysis . Analysis If potential confounders evenly distribute across study group , difference among group primary secondary outcome measure test one-way ANOVA Chi-square analysis appropriate continuous discrete variable .</detailed_description>
