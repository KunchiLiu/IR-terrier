	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , two-stage , multicenter , phase II study efficacy safety LDK378 evaluate patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC harbor confirm ALK rearrangement , define 15 % positive tumor cell assess FDA-approved FISH test ( Abbott Molecular Inc. ) use Vysis breakapart probe . Patients pre-screened test ALK positivity . The test confirm ALK rearrangement must perform either use archival tissue , preferably , use fresh biopsy prior study entry accord criterion , i.e . FDA-approved assay . The test perform Novartis designate central laboratory . After confirmation ALK positivity , study begin screen period ass eligibility , include 28 day prior first dose LDK378 . Patients must receive prior crizotinib . Patients must chemotherapy-naïve pretreated cytotoxic chemotherapy ( three prior line ) The study use Simon 's optimal two-stage design . Stage 1 consist 43 patient data 6 cycle treatment unless patient discontinue treatment earlier confirm response treatment observe prior complete 6 cycle . The trial stop Stage 1 futility 16 few response observe . If time last patient enrol Stage 1 minimum 17 response yet observe , accrual may temporarily suspend analysis Stage 1 . The Data Monitoring Committee periodically review response data make appropriate recommendation regard transition Stage 2 stop enrollment . Stage 2 include additional 62 patient . The primary analysis occur 105 patient complete 6 cycle treatment discontinue treatment earlier . The treatment period begin Day 1 Cycle 1 . All patient treat LDK378 , administer orally , start dose 750 mg. A total approximately 105 patient enrol study . Patients take LDK378 daily , approximately time day . On day PK sample obtain , patient take LDK378 clinic visit instruct study staff . Treatment LDK378 continue patient experience unacceptable toxicity precludes treatment , discontinue treatment discretion patient investigator , start new anti-cancer therapy dy . If patient experience RECIST-defined progressive disease ( PD ) LDK378 assess investigator , treatment study drug may continue , judgment investigator , still evidence clinical benefit . These patient count PD ORR , DOR , DCR PFS calculation . Assessments tumor response progression perform every 8 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) , start first day treatment LDK378 . This schedule tumor assessment every 8 week must continue regardless dose interruption . Tumor assessment continue : - For patient experience PD assess investigator , tumor assessment continue every 8 week LDK378 permanently discontinue ( i.e . patient continue treatment LDK378 PD , tumor assessment continue LDK378 permanently discontinue ) . - For patient discontinue treatment absence PD , tumor assessment continue every 8 week EOT visit PD assess investigator . Tumor evaluation always cease patient start new anti-cancer therapy , withdraws consent ( unless patient agrees continue efficacy assessment absence dose LDK378 , die . All tumor image assessment submit independent radiological assessment response Blinded Independent Review Committee ( BIRC ) . Clinical laboratory assessment perform . When patient discontinues study treatment End Treatment ( EOT ) visit must perform soon possible within 7 day last dose LDK378 . Patients contact safety follow-up 30 day last dose LDK378 determine experience new AEs and/or follow resolution ongoing AEs . Following end tumor assessment , Study Phase Completion Disposition eCRF must complete . Patients contact every 3 month obtain information pertain survival status death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent survival follow-up , end study . Patients need visit clinic survival follow-up .</detailed_description>
