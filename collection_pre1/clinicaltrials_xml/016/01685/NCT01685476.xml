	<brief_summary>In clinical practice , intracranial pressure ( ICP ) represent key parameter diagnose treat several condition . Physicians manage case head trauma , stroke hydrocephalus need assess time course ICP , yet often unwilling implement invasive monitoring beyond acute stage , account high septic risk . Standard technique include direct ventricular manometry measurement parenchyma electronic fiberoptic device . Therefore , design non-invasive clinical method gain access pressure change important challenge . Fluctuations ICP transmit fluid space inner ear cochlear aqueduct . The Biophysics Laboratory ( School Medicine Clermont-Ferrand ) describe intra-labyrinthic pressure modify functional activity outer hair cell cochlea . Thereby , increase ICP transfer increase intra-cochlear pressure , detect modification cochlear activity . Cochlear activity ' record non-invasive technically simple . A probe gently insert out portion external ear canal . The objective study ass prospectively accuracy precision new method ICP monitoring ( use cochlear activity ) compare invasive gold standard CSF pressure monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine evolution electrophysiological cochlear activity ( cochlear microphonic potential , CMP ) , non invasive method , invasive ICP monitoring . The data analysis determine relationship ICP variation CMP variation . Continuous ICP monitoring important place neuro-intensive care . ICP may measure either within ventricular cerebrospinal fluid within brain parenchyma . The purpose study ass prospectively accuracy precision new method indirect ICP monitoring ( use electrophysiological cochlear activity ) compare invasive gold standard ICP monitoring . The data analysis determine relationship ICP variation CMP variation . Electrophysiological cochlear activity , call electrocochleography ( ECochG ) , non invasive totally passive method use routine ENT department . The response measure ECochG cochlear microphonic potential ( CMP ) , generate out hair cell follow present tone burst 1kHz . CMP record help EchodiaÂ® hand-held equipment . Technically , simple , non-invasive detection ICP change ICP monitoring afford CMP recording .</detailed_description>
