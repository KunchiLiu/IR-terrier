	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study utilizing Lenalidomide , Adriamycin , Dexamethasone ( RAD ) comparator arm Lenalidomide , Bortezomib , Dexamethasone ( VRD ) latter consider novel `` standard '' induction protocol , since response general occur early start treatment decide choose three cycle either induction regimen . Together `` novel compound '' , tandem high-dose melphalan still standard care ; seem desirable re-address question number transplant ( single vs. double high-dose melphalan ) procedure require context triplet-induction protocol utilize least one novel compound . Thus , question ask current protocol whether immediate lenalidomide maintenance ( i.e . follow one cycle high-dose therapy ) investigational agent result identical progression free survival ( PFS ) compare tandem high-dose melphalan defer maintenance therapy . Despite induction novel compound , approximately 25 - 40 % patient less good partial response . Very recently , achievement less VGPR confirm negatively impact PFS well overall survival ( OS ) . Therefore , allogeneic stem cell transplantation consider standard care patient suboptimal response first autograft . In current protocol , standard favourable responder ( tandem-autologous transplant ) combine 3 year lenalidomide maintenance . This approach investigate patient less VGPR follow first autotransplant compare current standard intensification poor responder ( allogeneic transplantation ) .</brief_summary>
