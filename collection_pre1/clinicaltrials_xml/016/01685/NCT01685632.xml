	<detailed_description>Intra Peritoneal Chemo Hyperthermia ( IPCH ) recently validate option treatment peritoneal carcinomatosis colorectal ovarian origin . This therapeutic program demonstrate significant improvement late stage ( i.e . carcinomatosis ) disease ( survival median &gt; 33 month ) . IPCH induce morbidity high 20 % mortality le 4 % . From clinical point view , within first 24 hour IPCH , patient undergo systemic inflammatory response syndrome , therefore require monitor intensive care unit . From metabolic perspective , preliminary data show significant `` anaerobic style '' disturbance energetic metabolism , suggest deep cellular energetic deficit throughout IPCH process . Putative contradictory effect IPCH , like increase chemotherapy-related cellular toxicity due heat hand initiation stress protein response ( heat shock response ) help reduce cell injury , lead conduct research project underlie mechanism : consequence , term patient 's care follow-up , high relevance . Heat shock protein expression ( stress protein response marker ) apoptosis main chosen tool evaluate IPCH-related cellular consequence . Goals study Primary goal Multimodal assessment IPCH-related cell modification : signaling pathway , apoptosis antitumoral immune response . Secondary goal Comparative study Heat shock protein expression , whether IPCH do patient recuse surgery due intraoperative contraindication . Method Prospective cohort follow Procedure Besides usual care ( surgical debulking extensive tumoral resection laparotomy general anesthesia ) , research protocol include : - 7 blood sample 72 hour ( mean less 40 ml ) , include 4 sample general anesthesia throughout surgery 3 sample 3 follow day ( 24th , 48th 72th hour ) . - 6 tissue biopsy , i.e . 2 peritoneum disease-free 2 invaded peritoneum , represent volume le 1 cm3 2 biopsy healthy colonic tissue colon-related cancer 4 biopsy ( peritoneum n=2 , tumoral tissue n=2 ) ovarian-related cancer . All biopsy do surgery general anesthesia , biopsy per site before/after IPCH . Assessment criterion - main criterion : Heat shock protein expression ( blood/cell ratio ) compare baseline value . - associate criterion : apoptosis immune response before/after IPCH Statistical method/Sample size/Study 's lenght Scheduled sample size 30 patient IPCH 30 patient contraindicate per surgery . The normal distribution verify use d'Agostino-Pearson test . For intragroup comparison , repeat measure ANOVA do . For intergroup comparison , univariate analysis do , use Student t-test Fisher exact test . Taking account plan sample size annual number IPCH , schedule length study 18 month .</detailed_description>
