	<brief_summary>The intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , define hydrostatic pressure cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , key parameter diagnose treat several neurosurgical disease . Continuous ICP monitoring important place neuro-intensive care patient severe head trauma severe meningeal hemorrhage . Until assessment ICP require invasive method , pressure transducer either within ventricular CSF within brain parenchyma . The pressure sensor placement perform neurosurgery department . These invasive method also disadvantage : high risk infection , catheter misplace , risk bleeding . All justify development non invasive method . The Biophysics Laboratory ( School Medicine Clermont-Ferrand ) describe intra-labyrinthic pressure ( ILP ) modify functional activity outer hair cell cochlea . Cochlear activity ' record non-invasive technically simple . A probe gently insert out portion external ear canal . Anatomical study show communication subarachnoid space perilymphatic compartment cochlear aqueduct . Thereby , increase ICP transfer increase intra-cochlear pressure , detect modification cochlear activity . CSF dynamic test , constant flow infusion test , conduct patient diagnosis idiopathic adult hydrocephalus syndrome . Artificial CSF infuse lumbar needle , CSF space constant rate , correspond rise ICP register analyze . The objective study ass prospectively accuracy precision new method non invasive ICP measurement ( use cochlear activity ) compare invasive gold standard CSF pressure measurement CSF dynamic test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine evolution electrophysiological cochlear activity ( cochlear microphonic potential , CMP ) , non invasive method , invasive ICP monitoring . The data analysis determine relationship ICP variation CMP variation . Patients , neurosurgery department , investigate 'normal pressure ' chronic hydrocephalus involve CSF dynamic test . This complex protocol , include infusion test invasive CSF monitoring , need order confirm diagnosis . CSF dynamic test , socalled 'perfusion test ' , perform operating theater , patient awake sedate . During perfusion test , electrophysiological cochlear activity measure gold tiptrode ( Etymotic Research , Elk Grove Village , Ill ) gently insert ear canal . Electrophysiological cochlear activity , call electrocochleography ( ECochG ) , non invasive totally passive method use routine ENT department . The response measure ECochG cochlear microphonic potential ( CMP ) , generate out hair cell follow present tone burst 1kHz . CMP record help EchodiaÂ® hand-held equipment . Previously animal study show phase CM sensitive ICP change CM phase shift exhibit time course otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) . The phase change CM indeed use non-invasive tool monitoring intralabyrinthine intracranial pressure .</detailed_description>
