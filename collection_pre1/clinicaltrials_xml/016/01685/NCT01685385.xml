	<brief_summary>Difficulty breathe increase rate breathe common cause admission intensive care unit . This may due heart failure , cause infection lung . Treating doctor usually perform Chest X-ray , ECG , test know breathlessness due heart failure cause . Doctors also give medicine treat heart failure , condition lung base symptom investigation result . BNP release heart function well . However BNP level also high case severe infection.Hence equipoise utility BNP measurement among critically ill patient , current standard care . The current cost test ( 1000 rupee per measurement ) high , hence utility need carefully examine widespread use . The investigator intend test hypothesize on-admission BNP measurement , help clinician identify CHF early , may modify therapeutic decision , improve outcome . The current study design objective determine on-admission BNP value availability test result treat physician reduce in-hospital , 30-day mortality in-hospital morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-type NAtriuretic Peptide In Critically Ill : A Multicentric Diagnostic Study ( B-rAPID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There usually remain diagnostic uncertainty differentiation cardiogenic non-cardiogenic cause dyspnea . Often multiple underlying etiology acute onset dyspnea , evaluation lead diagnostic delay , hence longer hospital stay . While various clinical symptom , sign image base investigation use differentiation , accuracy remain low , overlap feature preclude differentiation . Echocardiography important adjunct make differentiation , operator skill , lack availability technique point care barrier use modality . B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , rapidly-assayed , serum biomarker , find effective distinguish congestive heart failure ( CHF ) cause dyspnea emergency urgent care setting . Recently test become available point care ( Alere Heart-Check ) . Ease , low cost , objectivity measurement BNP lead widespread incorporation BNP precursor NT-pro-BNP clinical evaluation CHF . Circulating level BNP/NT-proBNP normally low healthy individual . In response increase myocardial wall stress due volume- pressure-overload state ( CHF ) , BNP gene activate cardiomyocytes . This result production intracellular precursor propeptide ( proBNP108 ) ; process propeptide result release biologically inert aminoterminal fragment ( NT-proBNP ) biologically active BNP.Various study perform determine cut-off level make differentiation presence absence CHF use test . BNP level 50pg/ml rule CHF negative predictive value 96 % . ( 3 ) In study Maisel et al diagnostic accuracy B-type natriuretic peptide rule CHF cutoff 100 pg per milliliter 83.4 percent . However subsequent study instead suggest multiple cut-point strategy ( Less 100pg/ml rule CHF ( NPV 90 % ) , 400 pg/ml rule CHF ( 91 % specificity ) intermediate value represent grey zone . Individuals renal dysfunction elevate BNP level , low cut-off exclude CHF patient 200pg/ml . Individuals high BMI falsely low level BMI adjust correction use ( Lower cut-off 54pg/mL BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 ) . The level BNP well NT-Pro-BNP similar elevation CHF , later three time much high . ( 1 ) Use BNP differentiate CHF cause dyspnea , ( 4 ) ease measurement result increase use intensive care setting , point-of-care test potential change outcome . However test use setting , high BNP level detect critically ill patient sepsis shock . In patient shock , level 1200pg/ml negative predictive value 92 % cardiogenic shock . Such high level patient compromise systolic function question utility measure distinguish CHF cause critical care setting . It debate critically ill patient , coexist organ dysfunction , rapid change volume status , variable bioavailability burst synthesis BNP may confound interpretation BNP level . However despite confounding , even critically ill patient higher value associate adverse prognosis , low level ( less 100pg/ml ) mean preserve leave ventricular function . Thus , know BNP really give useful information , already available clinical , radiologic biochemical measurement , investigator know test result become available intensive care unit setting , help treat physician make meaningful clinical decision . Given consideration , equipoise utility BNP measurement among critically ill patient , current standard care . The current cost test ( 1000 rupee per measurement ) high , hence utility need carefully examine widespread use . The investigator intend test hypothesize on-admission BNP measurement , help clinician identify CHF early , may modify therapeutic decision , improve outcome . The current study design objective determine on-admission BNP value availability test result treat physician reduce in-hospital , 30-day mortality in-hospital morbidity .</detailed_description>
