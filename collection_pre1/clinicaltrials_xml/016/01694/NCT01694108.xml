	<brief_summary>In high-income society use health care medication steadily increase . Children high morbidity , many visit general practitioner , increase number hospitalisation , increase use medication . And , child ill , someone stay home care . An un-explained global increase incidence allergic disease eczema , wheeze , asthma allergy mean 25 % high-income population affect . Cheap preventive measure highly warrant . Recent study show positive , non-specific effect early Bacille Calmette Guérin ( BCG ) immunisation neonatal mortality low-income country suggest positive , non-specific effect allergic disease high-income country . `` Non-specific '' mean vaccine effect go beyond prevention target disease , i.e . BCG vaccine benefit health status immunise individual way unrelated protection tuberculosis ( TB ) . For instance , recent randomise trial West Africa investigator show BCG vaccine birth safe low birth weight ( LBW ) infants significantly reduce neonatal mortality child , significant long-lasting effect infant mortality small newborn birth weight &lt; 1.5 kg . There urgent need explore huge potential BCG 's beneficial immune-stimulatory effect among child high-income population . Therefore , investigator carry large prospective randomise clinical trial Denmark primarily design test hypothesis infant get BCG vaccine birth experience 20 % few hospitalisation early childhood . Secondary outcomes 1 . To test hypothesis infant get BCG vaccine birth prescribe less antibiotic early childhood non-BCG-immunised infant . 2 . To test hypothesis Danish infant get BCG vaccine birth develop less eczema , asthmatic bronchitis/wheeze food allergy 3 12 month age : self-reported , diagnosed physician , find clinical examination ; prescribe less anti-eczema/asthma/allergy medication early childhood non-BCG-immunised infant . 3 . To test hypothesis infant receive BCG birth respond paraclinical measure : Specific IgE , thymic gland size , leucocyte count differentiation , monocyte memory , cytokine profile , antibody titre follow immunisation diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , pneumococcus , hemophilus . 4 . To test hypothesis infant get BCG vaccine birth respond growth measure : weight , length head circumference . 5 . To test hypothesis infant get BCG vaccine birth respond decrease morbidity : common cold , pneumonia , febrile episode , diarrhoea vomiting , acute otitis medium , febrile convulsion . 6 . To test hypothesis premature infant gestational age le 37 week get BCG vaccine birth unaffected psychomotor development measure : Ages Stages score . 7 . To test hypothesis infant get BCG vaccine birth unaffected coverage subsequent vaccination Child Vaccination Programme . 8 . To test mentioned hypothesis specifically strata premature low-birth-weight Danish infant .</brief_summary>
