	<brief_summary>Even mitral valve repair procedure ( MVP ) severe mitral stenosis ( MS ) , intraoperative assessment mitral valve area ( MVA ) necessary evaluate severity MS repair exclude residual MS immediate determination success repair procedure postoperative prognosis . For purpose , several method apply introperative transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) : pressure half-time ( PHT ) mitral inflow Doppler 2-dimensional ( 2D ) planimetry method widely use clinical practice . However , especially MVP , PHT method usually unreliable usually underestimate MVA due various intraoperative hemodynamic factor . The author hypothesize MVA determine 3D TEE would accurate PHT immediate post-MVP procedure severe MS patient comparable postoperative MVA determine MDCT . Therefore , present study determine MVA use PHT , 3D planimetry MDCT MVP procedure severe MS patient analyze evaluate 3D TEE 's utility evaluation MVA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain permission Institutional Review Board Konkuk University Medical Center , Seoul , South Korea , patient schedule undergo elective MVP due moderate MS leave atrial enlargement without atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) sign write informed consent agreement prospectively participate present study . In addition routine transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation , cardiac CT examination perform recruited patient prior surgery determine MVA . Induction anesthesia tracheal intubation perform administration intravenous etomidate 0.1-0.2 mg/kg rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg follow continuous infusion remifentanil ( 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg/min ) . After tracheal intubation , sevoflurane ( 1.0 inspire vol % ) infusion rocuronium ( 0.2 mg/kg/hr ) administer anesthesia maintenance . After anesthesia induction , pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) place right internal jugular vein pulmonary artery pressure guidance 3D TEE probe ( X-9™ , Philips Medical Systems Andover , MA , USA ) insert comprehensive intraoperative TEE examination use 3D echocardiographic image platform ( iE33 ; Philips Medical Systems , Andover , MA , USA ) . While momentarily turn ventilator , three consecutive velocity-time integral ( VTIs ) mitral inflow Doppler scan obtain apply continuous wave Doppler parallel mitral inflow Color Doppler signal midesophageal long-axis view . In case AFib , big VTI among 5 consecutive VTIs mitral inflow Doppler use determine PHT detect maximal mitral inflow among irregular heartbeat . Immediately record VTIs , live 3D zoom `` en face '' MV view leave atrium ( LA ) leave ventricle ( LV ) perspective acquire . As baseline data , MVA determine use PHT method ( MVA-PHT ) : PHT mitral inflow deceleration slope determine use stored mitral inflow Doppler VTI MVA automatically calculate assume MVA = 220/PHT . At time , 2D image small MVA perpendicular mitral inflow maximal MV opening achieve post-processing include align cropping acquire 3D image instal software ( 3DQ™ Q-lab™ , Philips , USA ) . MVA determine circumferential trace leaflet edge MV opening crop reconstruct tomographic image store 3D volume image ( MVA-3D ) ( Fig . 1 ) . All MVA measurement repeat 3 time within minimal time interval expert cardiac anesthesiologist mean value use analysis . All patient get single type MVP ( Comprehensive Mitral Valve Apparatus Reconstruction™ ) consist follow procedure moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) one cardiac surgeon : restoration sufficient MV open repair anterior posterior MV leaflet , mitral commissure , chordate ; lift posterior annuloplasty use flexible ready use band . A Maze operation additionally perform patient associate Afib . Immediately wean CPB achieve stable hemodynamics ( mean arterial blood pressure &gt; 65 mmHg , heart rate 60-90 beat per minute , cardiac index &gt; 2.0 L/min/m2 ) , MVA-PHT MVA-3D determine manner baseline data acquisition . The following intraoperative exclusion criterion apply : 1 ) intraoperative conversion MV replacement due insufficient repair procedure , 2 ) inability delineate MV opening due insufficient 3D imaging . Within 7 postoperative day , MVA-CT determine comparison method expert cardiac radiologist manner apply preoperatively . Statistical analysis conduct use SPSS 18.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . To assess intra-observer variability , MVAs measure PHT method 3D planimetry TEE analyze use intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . The comparison MVA-PHT , MVA-3D , MVA-CT MVP analyse use One Way Repeated Measures Analysis Variance pairwise multiple comparison perform via Tukey method . The comparison continuous variable echocardiographic finding perform paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank test . The linear regression analysis use determine possible correlation MVA use method . Data express mean ± SD ( 95 % confidence interval . CI ) median ( 25 % -75 % ) , number patient . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
