	<brief_summary>We hypothesize administration LDE-225 human pancreatic cancer result inhibition paracrine HH signal pancreatic tumor stroma effect autocrine signal tumor cell compartment . Furthermore hypothesize treatment LDE-225 result change tumor stroma ( decreased desmoplasia , increased vascularity ) result improved tumor blood flow . The purpose study determine , LDE-225 work pancreatic cancer . A cancer cell 's growth depend cell tissue around . The cell tissue make chemical signal influence cancer 's growth . This research study evaluate LDE-225 design interfere one growth signal cause pancreatic cancer growth .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients biopsy probable , resectable pancreatic cancer . Patients expect undergo surgery minimum 14 day follow signing consent . Patients must give informed consent . Patients must 18 ECOG performance status ≤2 life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : ANC ≥1,500 /µL Platelets ≥100,000 /µL Hemoglobin &gt; 10gm/dl creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN Plasma creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN PT/PTT WNL Patients may abnormal bilirubin , conclude surgeon relate biliary ductal obstruction , may include bilirubin &lt; 3 X ULN . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Exclusion Criteria Poor surgical risk due comorbidities poor performance status Patients receive prior treatment smoothen antagonist , ( GDC0449 ( Genentech ) , IPI926 ( Infinity ) . Patients receive chemotherapy within period time &lt; cycle length use treatment ( e.g . &lt; 6 week nitrosoureas , mitomycinC ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients receive wide field radiotherapy ( include therapeutic radioisotope strontium 89 ) ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . Patients receive biologic therapy ( e.g . antibody ) ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients treat targeted agent ≤ 5 t1/2 ≤ 4 week ( whichever short ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients receive investigational agent ≤ 5 t1/2 ≤ 4 week ( whichever short ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Poor oral intake and/or inability take capsule Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease Chron 's Disease Ulcerative Cholitis , shortgut syndrome , celiac sprue disease may significantly alter absorption LDE225 Urgent/emergent need surgery ( &lt; 7 day ) Documented cirrhotic liver disease , ongoing alcohol abuse , know active acute hepatitis Impaired cardiac function clinically significant heart disease , include one following : Angina pectoris within 3 month Acute myocardial infarction within 3 month QTcF &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female screen ECG A past medical history clinically significant ECG abnormality family history prolong QTinterval syndrome Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Patients venous thromboembolic event ( e.g. , pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis ) require anticoagulation Presence active infection systemic use antibiotic within 72 hour enrollment . Significant comorbid condition disease judgment Investigator would place patient undue risk interfere study . Examples include , limited sepsis , recent significant cardiac pulmonary disease , condition . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity Known hypersensitivity LDE225 , excipients LDE225 Pregnant lactate woman . Patients receive treatment medication know moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment LDE225 . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment LDE225 . Patients neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis , HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil , discontinue least 2 week prior start LDE225 treatment . If essential patient stay statin control hyperlipidemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . b ) Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . NB : Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid whilst LDE225 treatment . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 4 month stop study treatment . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Sexually active male must use condom intercourse take drug 6 month stop treatment father child period . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . Step Two Adequate Fine Needle Biopsy</criteria>
