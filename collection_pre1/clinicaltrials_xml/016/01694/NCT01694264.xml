	<brief_title>Study Anti-Viral Prophylaxis HBsAg ( + ) HBcAb ( + ) /HBsAb ( - ) Patients Starting Anti-TNFα</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biologic agent , especially anti-TNFα treatment widely use inflammatory arthritis rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . More 60 % RA AS patient achieve good clinical response anti-TNFα treatment . However , TNFα also important mediator participate normal immune response infectious agent , particular intracellular microorganism human body . Therefore , opportunistic infection tuberculosis , viral fungal infection concern use anti-TNFα agent . With accumulate experience , treatment guideline anti-TNFα therapy latent tuberculosis well establish . It noteworthy number case report describe hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation otherwise asymptomatic carrier receive anti-TNFα treatment . Anti-TNFα agent utilized promising treatment regimen RA AS treatment even HBsAg carrier , yet still concern risk anti-TNFα therapy contribute HBV reactivation . In previous study , find anti-viral therapy start anti-TNFα treatment may reduce incidence HBV reactivation , entecavir likely suitable long-term prophylaxis HBsAg carriers anti-TNFα treatment . This justifies need prospective trial could demonstrate long-term effect prophylaxis use anti-TNFα therapy subgroup patient . It would help clinician understand 1 ) whether anti-viral therapy necessary inactive HBsAg carrier initiate anti-TNFα treatment , 2 ) time point would likely witness HBV reactivation start anti-TNFα therapy without anti-viral therapy coverage . In addition establish nationwide network Rheumatologists work major academic institute Korea , division Seoul National University Hospital lead many multi-center trial throughout past year . In summary , question whether combine anti-viral prophylaxis HBsAg carrier start anti-TNFα therapy important issue Rheumatologists . There guideline managing subset patient , clinician normally begin anti-viral therapy patient 's liver function worsens . Therefore , nationwide network specialist propose launch prospective study investigate benefit anti-viral prophylaxis entecavir HBsAg carrier start anti-TNFα treatment .</detailed_description>
