	<brief_summary>An investigation difference stoma hernia frequency related surgical technique incise fascia . All patient plan elective colostomy formation include . Patients undergoing rectal resection TME colostomy ( Hartmann 's procedure ) rectal cancer , abdominoperineal resection rectal cancer divert colostomy reason include . The three group randomization : A. circular incision abdominal wall fascia B. cruciate incision abdominal wall fascia C. mesh enforce cruciate incision abdominal wall fascia Primary endpoint parastomal hernia rate within 12 month index surgery . Secondary end-points include clinical variable , re-admission and/or re-operation due stoma complication , quality life health economy analyse , 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Technical Aspects Stoma Construction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colostomy formation standard surgical procedure 100 year . Initially quality life stoma patient good , appliance collect feces cumbersome , smelly ensure non-leakage . As late 60-ies bandage still primitive ( 1 ) . Gradually problem decrease technique bandage improve . A well function colostomy may negatively affect patient 's Quality Life ( QoL ) ( 2 ) , although thorough information support stoma care nurse utmost importance ( 3 ) . However , say stoma well function complication keep minimum . The complication rate stoma formation still considerable , figure 21-70 % ( 4 , 5 ) study show adequate height ; type stoma , BMI , emergency surgery gender may importance reduce risk complication short long-term ( 6-8 ) . The surgical technique stoma formation partly evidence base . There study direct technical detail stoma construction future impact stoma function , apart importance stoma height ( 6 ) . One study test standardize skin incision 2/3rds width bowel ( 9 ) , although actual impact functional outcome stoma presented.. In surgical literature cruciate incision fascia extraction bowel hole sufficient size short description surgical technique ( 10 ) . In clinical practice sufficient size hole often equal `` two fingers-width '' , commonly use , refers width surgeon 's finger , fairly inexact measurement . A pilot study Sahlgrenska University Hospital find clinical practice part result skin incision diameter 50 % bowel width . There discussion regard placement stoma effect hernia incidence , whether obliquous muscle rectus abdominis ( 11 ) bowel take extraperitoneal route ( ad modum Goligher ) ( 12 ) . No study sufficient design size thoroughly answer question . Parastomal hernia long-term complication common , literature figure almost 50 % report ( 13 , 14 ) . Attempts reduce rate parastomal hernia make last year placement mesh , construction stoma , ( 15-19 ) . This practice universally accept , part due hesitance surgical society risk infection foreign body material , partly due study underpowered main outcome variable . Another suggestion basic construction stoma make circular incision fascia instead cruciate , documented study . It describe conjunction use circular stapling device skin , hernia find , however patient number small ( 20 ) . It apparent study welcome . The evaluation parastomal hernia discuss . Janes et al . use clinical examination study ( 16 , 17 ) , confirm later study concurrence CT-verified parastomal hernia ( 21 ) sufficient perform prone position . Another recent study find result CT-scan correlated patient symptom ( 22 ) . Other study evaluate use ultrasound find feasible ( 23 ) . The conclusion must evaluation parastomal hernia may difficult must standardize study . The hypothesis test study circular incision mesh enforce cruciate incision abdominal wall fascia diameter 50 % width patient leave colon result carry less risk parastomal herniation cruciate incision arm measure 1/2 diameter patient leave colon . The aim trial compare parastomal hernia formation within 12 month stoma surgery circular , mesh enforce cruciate cruciate incision .</detailed_description>
