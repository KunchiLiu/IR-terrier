PostOperative The Subject report score moderate severe 4point categorical rating scale ( category none , mild , moderate , severe ) plus score ≥4 NPRS 11point categorical rating scale within 8 hour end surgery . End surgery define time last suture . The Subject able answer question follow command . The surgical procedure incision closure longer 2 hour . The Subject evidence respiratory insufficiency , respiratory rate le 8 breath per minute arterial oxygen saturation pulse oximetry le 95 % supplemental oxygen . There significant deviation surgical anesthetic protocol would , opinion investigator , put Subject risk participation trial , confound analgesic endpoint trial cause concern regard Subject 's ability participate trial .</criteria>
