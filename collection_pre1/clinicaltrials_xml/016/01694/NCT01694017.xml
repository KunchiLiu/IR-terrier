	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare clinical , economical quality life ( QOL ) outcomes patient live HIV zidovudine/stavudine regimen tenofovir regimen . This study unblinded randomize trial . The first step empirical data collection one year calculate incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . The second step perform simulation model calculate long term ICER .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug regimen treatment HIV free ART center India include stavudine/zidovudine lamivudine nevirapine . Approximately 20-30 % patient regimen experience drug toxicity within first six month treatment . The tenofovir base regimen one least toxic regimen le 5 % patient experience toxicity . Tenofovir base regimen consider first choice ART Indian governmental program , expensive drug regimen , spite well clinical outcome resource limited setting . The cost treatment stavudine/zidovudine presume less expensive prefer first line treatment , believe although direct cost government less , patient zidovudine/stavudine regimen spend money additional hospital visit admission , laboratory investigation medication due ART induce toxicity . There publish data include economic , clinical quality life outcome compare two regimen India . Hence , unblinded randomize pragmatic comparative effectiveness study seek identify best treatment HIV patient base incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , quality life ( QOL ) clinical outcome . The clinical outcome include viral suppression , change CD4 proportion patient toxicity opportunistic infection . Direct cost treatment calculate . The QOL score estimate compare regimen use questionnaire . QOL score direct cost use utility calculate ICER .</detailed_description>
