	<brief_summary>DLBS1033 bioactive protein fraction extract Lumbricus rubellus earthworm . This earthworm come Pengalengan , West Java , Indonesia . DLBS1033 possess 8 major protein molecular weight 100 kDa , name Lumbricus Low Molecular weight Proteins ( LLP ) . This enzym transport bloodstream via intestinal epitel . Structure DLBS1033 look like lumbrokinase . Lumbrokinase enzym consist 6 isoenzyme serine protease . As drug consist serin protease enzym , suspect mechanism action DLBS1033 similar lumbrokinase , especially plasminogen activator fibrinolytic system . In vitro study Trisina et al show DLBS1033 fibrinogenolytic activity fibrinogen α , beta , gamma chain , decrease platelet aggregation clot time prolong . Until , mechanism action effect DLBS1033 human fibrinolytic coagulation system still unknown . Therefore , aim clinical trial evaluate effect DLBS1033 human fibrinolytic coagulation system healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fibrinolysis process lyse clot form thrombin . It start activate plasminogen plasmin endogenous tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) . These activator find endothelium , granulocytes monocyte . Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) major inhibitor tPA uPA ) α2-antiplasmin major inhibitor plasmin . Plasmin wil degrade soluble fibrinogen fibrin produce fibrinogen degradation product fibrin degradation product , respectively . Lumbrokinase investigate animal study . Kim et al conducting rat administer freeze-dried powder Lumbricus rubellus earthworm orally . This study show earthworm powder valuable prevention and/or treatment thrombotic condition . Similar conclusion also show study Lee et al , compare antithrombotic fibrinolytic activity lumbrokinase SPP-501 ( extract Eisenia andrei earthworm ) urokinase t-PA thrombosis model rat vena . The result study decrease thrombus weight , shorten euglobulin lysis time ( ELT ) , reduce platelet aggregation rat give SPP-501 . Conclusion several clinical trial similar several study animal . From study conduct Jin et al 51 cerebral infarct subject give 3 time 400 mg lumbrokinase ( n = 31 ) control ( n = 20 ) 28 day . In treatment group , kaolin partial thromboplastin time ( KPTT ) prolong , t-PA activity D-dimer level increase , fibrinogen decrease significantly . It conclude mechanism lumbrokinase oral antithrombotic fibrinolytic inhibition coagulation intrinsic pathway activate fibrinolytic pathway increase t-PA activity . Fibrinolytic activity also conclude Rey , conduct study 28 diabetic foot ulcer subject , give 3 time 500 mg lumbrokinase per day ( n = 14 ) 7 day , placebo . On study , treatment group mean D-dimer increase . From many clinical trial , conclude effect lumbrokinase see several day . It different intravenous fibrinolytic enzym , streptokinase t-PA , effect see soon use . Therefore oral lumbrokinase could replace function intravenous fibrinolytic enzym , use acute thrombosis . Based antithrombotic fibrinolytic activity , lumbrokinase might use secondary prevention acute thrombosis , myocard infarct stroke . Some researcher start clinical trial hypothesis . Pilot study Kasim et al use lumbrokinase 10 patient stable angina pectoris . This study show 70 % total sample receive lumbrokinase significant decrease sum stress score perfusion image good perfusion viable myocardium 30 day lumbrokinase treatment .</detailed_description>
