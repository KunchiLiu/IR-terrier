	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration lead cause blindness develop country . Geographic atrophy advance form dry age-related macular degeneration , currently effective therapy . Little known risk factor drive progression geographic atrophy , yet crucial understand mechanism disease . Therefore , identification risk factor associate faster spread atrophy may help contribute identify cause disease , ultimately , develop new therapeutic strategy manage disorder . The current prospective , observational , natural history study follow objective : - Describe natural history geographic atrophy anatomic visual term - Identify risk factor associate faster enlargement atrophy The main hypothesis lipofuscin accumulation border atrophy see fundus autofluorescence imaging associate faster progression disease .</detailed_description>
