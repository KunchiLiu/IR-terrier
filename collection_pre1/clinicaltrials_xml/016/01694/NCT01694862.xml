	<brief_summary>The overarch aim Integra Initiative strengthen evidence base impact integrate family planning ( FP ) , postnatal care ( PNC ) HIV service sub-Saharan Africa . Specifically , study investigator aim test follow hypothesis : provision integrate service , compare separate service , : 1. lead increase uptake range SRH service . 2. attract great number diversity client . 3. lead increase quality range SRH service 4. lead healthy sexual reproductive behavior . 5. lead reduce stigma health facility . 6. lead efficient use resource , low unit cost provision key service . For purpose study integration define offering client HIV postnatal care ( PNC ) HIV family planning ( FP ) service visit . To good understand service integrate different country study focus two key model integration Kenya Swaziland . - The first model focus integration FP HIV service ( integrated FP model ) entail perform HIV testing , STI screen management , cervical cancer screening , condom promotion within FP consultation , well active referral antiretroviral ( ART ) unit HIV-positive client . The FP model evaluate Kenya . - The second model focus integration PNC HIV service ( integrated PNC model ) implement Kenya Swaziland . The model focus provision PNC service mother baby , FP service , repeat HIV test mother , HIV test infant referral HIV service HIV positive mother infant , well referrals client require additional service .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many well-established reason support rationale integrate link sexual reproductive health ( SRH ) HIV service develop country generalize HIV epidemic - primarily sub-Saharan Africa . Yet evidence base impact integrate service delivery health outcome cost remain weak . Partly result methodological difficulty . There emerge body literature address challenge use randomize controlled trial assess impact public health intervention . Particularly case Integra Initiative , causal chain ( intervention outcome ) long , broad range outcome need explore , already degree integration occur clinic setting , attempt conduct randomize control trial appropriate . Consistent evaluation design describe Habicht colleague , Integra design include evaluation performance impact try make two type causal inference : adequacy plausibility . Evaluation adequacy assess whether expect change provision , service utilisation cost-effectiveness occur intervention facility . Evaluation impact ass plausibility change service , health behavioral outcome due Integra Initiative . The case plausibility build follow strand evidence : - Comparing finding 'intervention ' facility facility choose 'comparison ' site prior evaluation - Exploring dose-response relationship measure extent integration study outcomes - Measuring change performance time , demonstrate logical sequence intervention ( integration ) outcomes . - Measuring change step logic model - prerequisite attribution intervention - Triangulating finding mix research method capture range perspectives insight different discipline . The study employ control pre- post-test quasi-experimental , non-randomised , design utilise multiple research method ( cohort study , community survey , clinic assessment , cost tool qualitative interview ) . Since research conduct real-life health delivery setting programmatic contamination possible due ongoing health programme intervention study period , control group refer 'comparison group ' , outcome compare time two year implementation .</detailed_description>
