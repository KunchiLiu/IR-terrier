	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Masitinib Comparison Sunitinib Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour After Progression With Imatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GISTs uncommon visceral sarcoma arise predominantly gastrointestinal tract . Most GIST cell positive c-kit ( CD117 ) , cell surface antigen correspond Stem Cell Factor ( SCF ) receptor . The receptor intracellular tyrosine kinase ( TK ) join juxtamembrane domain . It hypothesize malignant GIST cell harbor mutation c-kit , result activation c-kit cell division tumour growth . Drugs selectively inhibit TKs likely benefit GISTs . Masitinib ( AB1010 ) TK inhibitor , selectively effectively inhibit c-kit . Imatinib also TK inhibitor indicate treatment GIST . It might associate side effect patient might develop resistance treatment time . Based pre-clinical clinical study , masitinib ( AB1010 ) consider good candidate second line treatment patient GIST progression imatinib .</detailed_description>
