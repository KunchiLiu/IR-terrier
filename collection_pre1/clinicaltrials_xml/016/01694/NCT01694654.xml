	<detailed_description>Retrospective observational study patient SFPT German spoken part Switzerland 2000 2011 ( approximately 300 patient ) : Phase 1 ) Information leaflet ( letter invitation ) study center ( University Hospital Zurich ) institute pathology university , cantonal city hospital German spoken part Switzerland . Patient recruitment perform medical staff aforementioned institute pathology . Phase 2 ) Obtaining first orally ( telephone ) thereafter write informed consent patient perform medical staff aforementioned institute pathology . Phase 3 ) After write oral consent give , doctoral candidate ( member study group , student University Zurich ) perform data entry base clinical histological record locally external institute pathology ( patient record file copy transfer original University Hospital Zurich ) . Data entry electronic case report ( excel file study laptop ) perform anonymous data . Hence , patient study number contain treat hospital , year diagnosis consecutive number ( e.g . KSSG-2011-1 , KSSG-2011-2 , STZ-2007-1 , STZ-2007-2 , â€¦ ) . No names birth date appear case report form . Provided informed consent give , patient follow-up perform contact primary care physician ( general physician family doctor ) telephone , handle doctoral candidate . Deceased patient incorporate within study . Phase 4 ) Review histological specimen collect aforementioned doctoral candidate bring University Hospital Zurich , Institute Pathology , immunohistochemical/molecular examination , immunostaining , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) mutational analysis histological specimen perform PD Dr. A. Soltermann , member study team . After , specimen return original institute pathology , take . All specimen make anonymous moment collection external hospital doctoral candidate ( specimen label aforementioned study number , assigned case report form ) . Phase 5 ) Data analysis , publication .</detailed_description>
