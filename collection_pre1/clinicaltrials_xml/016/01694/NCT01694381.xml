	<brief_summary>Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( pro-urokinase ) highly effective thrombolytic drug . At pharmacologic concentration however , pro-urokinase convert urokinase - non specific thrombolytic , limit therapeutic use . Mutant pro-urokinase ( M5 ) stable conversion urokinase inhibit C1-inhibitor . The primary objective study : - To assess overall safety tolerability relate systemic plasminogen activation single dos M5 wide dose range ( study part I ) . - To assess effect single dose C1-inhibitor overall safety tolerability single dose M5 effect M5-induced coagulation change ( study part II ) .</brief_summary>
