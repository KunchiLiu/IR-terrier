	<brief_summary>This prospective , double-blinded , randomize , parallel cohort study examine genital systemic safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , disintegration disappearance time , acceptability four vaginal tablet : 1 ) Tenofovir ( TFV ) alone ; 2 ) Emtricitabine ( FTC ) alone ; 3 ) TFV combine FTC ; 4 ) placebo . Participants randomize treatment group , number tablet insert Single Use Phase ( 1 tablet 1 tablet follow second tablet two hour later mimic BAT24 dose regimen ) , one four collection time point ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour tablet insertion ) assessment last dose Multiple Use Phase . In Single Use Phase study , participant insert one tablet clinic estimate time disintegration disappearance . Those randomized two tablet insert second tablet 2 hour later . In woman , sample collection occur 5 hour initial tablet insertion . In Multiple Use Phase study , participant insert tablet daily 14 day .
