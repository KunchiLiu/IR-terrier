	<brief_summary>This randomize , double blind , placebo control , parallel group , multiple dose study evaluate efficacy AMG 181 compare placebo measure proportion subject remission ( total Mayo Score &lt; 2 point individual subscore &gt; 1 point ) week 8 . After complete screen assessment meet eligibility criterion , subject randomize receive placebo AMG 181 various dos per protocol . A maximum approximately 50 % subject prior anti-TNF agent use allow study . At end double blind period , subject enter open label period subject receive open label AMG 181 single dose level accord protocol . Subjects fail achieve response week 8 also inadequate response week 12 eligible enter open label period study early . Subjects achieve response and/or remission week 8 subsequently experience disease worsen eligible enter open label period early ONLY confirmatory rectosigmoidoscopy confirm disease severity define protocol . Subjects complete open label period early terminate study enter 2 year safety follow period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 181 Phase 2 Study Subjects With Moderate Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : A Randomized , Double blind , Multiple Dose Placebo Controlled Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy AMG 181 Subjects Moderate Severe Ulcerative Colitis Study Phase : 2 Indication : Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Primary Endpoint : Remission week 8 define total Mayo Score , 2 point , individual subscore &gt; 1 point Key Secondary Endpoints : • Response week 8 define decrease baseline total Mayo Score &gt; 3 point &gt; 30 % , accompany decrease subscore rectal bleeding &gt; 1 point absolute subscore rectal bleed 0 1 • Mucosal heal week 8 define absolute subscore rectosigmoidoscopy 0 1 Safety Endpoints : • Adverse event • Serious adverse event • Significant change laboratory value vital sign • Sample Size : 360 Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : Subjects must diagnosis UC &gt; 3 month , moderate severe disease activity time enrolment base total Mayo Score 6 12 minimum rectosigmoidoscopy subscore &gt; 2 . Subjects must demonstrate inadequate response , loss response , intolerance immunomodulators anti-TNF agent , corticosteroid ( non-US site ) .. Subjects may continue stable dos protocol specify medication treat UC . A maximum approximately 50 % subject prior anti-TNF agent use allow study . Subjects must neurological exam free clinically significant , unexplained sign symptom screen clinically significant change prior randomization . In addition , subject must free concurrent medical condition study entry describe protocol . If applicable , female subject must willing use two highly effective method birth control one highly effective one effective method birth control study . Amgen Investigational Product Dosage Administration : Investigational Product administer subcutaneously . During 24 week double blind placebo control period , subject randomize receive either placebo select dose AMG 181 per protocol use repeat injection week 24 . During open label period , subject receive AMG 181 per protocol use repeated injection . Control Group : The double blind period ( first 24 week ) control . During period , control group receive placebo..</detailed_description>
