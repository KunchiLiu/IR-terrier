	<detailed_description>1.1 Background rationale The alleviation pain basic human right regardless age . Neonates feel pain show preterm infant even vulnerable pain old infant . The vulnerable preterm neonate precisely expose pain . Neonates admit intensive care unit , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) , undergo dozen even hundred painful procedure stay . These painful procedure include , many ICU neonate , tracheal intubation follow mechanical ventilation . The pain stress induce mechanical ventilation well repetitive procedure painful disease lead medical staff use sedation analgesia neonate admit intensive care unit . The subjectivity difficulty inherent pain measurement neonates probably contribute wide variety neonatal sedation analgesia practice . To date , practice rarely study . Why would sedation analgesia necessary ? Mechanical ventilation potentially painful intervention . Adults often describe mechanical ventilation painful anxiety-provoking experience . The main objective sedation analgesia : reduction pain , stress irritability , promotion blood pressure stability , promotion ventilator synchrony improvement oxygenation . In long term , reduce stress , well reduced fluctuation oxygenation blood pressure believe minimize risk neurological injury death . However , use sedation analgesia conceivable respect principle must accompany medical action : first , harm . Pain stress undergone neonatal period deleterious short-term long-term consequence . Some consequence reduce adequate analgesic treatment . Current data show necessity give adequate sedation analgesia ventilate neonate . Statements promote use sedation analgesia The increased awareness neonate feel pain , ethical obligation treat pain analgesic , grow body evidence demonstrate untreated neonatal pain lead alter reactivity pain persist throughout infancy childhood well need humane management neonate lead development International National Guidelines promote use analgesic neonatal population . These Guidelines state unit provide neonatal care develop implement guideline concern neonatal pain . However , exist literature still conflict regard use sedation analgesia ventilate neonate . Current data indicate insufficient evidence recommend routine use opioids mechanically ventilate newborns opioids use selectively . Sedation analgesia non ventilated baby extremely rare . Practices across Europe USA Data sedation analgesia practice ventilate neonate rare . In 1995 SOPAIN study carry United States show factor predict use on-going analgesia sedation neonate include : mechanical ventilation , high gestational age , male gender . In 2005 , French EPIPPAIN study show rate continuous sedation analgesia 69.6 % ventilate neonate large variation among center ( 16.7 % 90.9 % ) . The frequently use drug midazolam morphine . To date , data permit comparison neonatal pain management within European country . The availability data enable comparison practice state-of-the-art knowledge . Study Hypothesis The EUROPAIN study epidemiological study base follow hypothesis : - Most newborn ventilate infant receive continuous sedation analgesia . - Non ventilated baby sedate . - Morphine , fentanyl midazolam frequently drug use set . - Infrequent use validate pain assessment tool monitor sedation analgesia occur ventilate newborn infant . - Most unit develop write local guideline sedation analgesia ventilate neonate , huge variability exist among practitioner unit , across different unit country , across different country Europe . - Development , dissemination , regular update common European standard improve care clinical outcome ventilate newborn infant . 1.2 Main objective • To determine current clinical practice regard use sedative analgesic drug ventilate newborns different country Europe . 1.3 Principal criterion - The frequency ventilate neonate receive sedation analgesia different European unit - The medication use sedation analgesia ventilate neonate across Europe . - The length use medication administer sedation analgesia ventilate neonate - Similarities difference sedation analgesia practice among European country 1.4 Secondary objective criterion - To determine proportion neonatal unit develop implemented local write guideline provide continuous sedation analgesia ventilate newborn infant well prevent treat procedural pain . - To document publish guideline neonatal analgesia sedation different European country develop consensus common European standard apply medical setting . - To determine frequency use pain assessment tool ventilate newborn infant evaluate impact pain management practice . - To determine practice assess prevent withdrawal syndrome . Secondary criterion - Variations across European country proportion unit develop implemented local write guideline sedation analgesia ventilate neonate - Identification description national guideline sedation analgesia neonates participate country . Identification recommend drug . 1.5 Type study • Epidemiological observational study . 1.6 Study plan The EUROPAIN STUDY observational therefore interfere routine practice participate unit . No change diagnostic , therapeutic manage strategy patient impose participation study . This epidemiological study collect data clinical practice unit . The inclusion criterion : • All neonate correct age 44 week post conception . That mean , example , baby 40 week gestational age include 28 day ( 4 week ) post natal age baby 32 week gestational age include 12 week post natal age . At unit level - No modification current manage protocols strategy require participation EUROPAIN STUDY . The unit coordinator provide data local protocol manage procedural pain sedation analgesia neonates well general statistic unit . All treatment authorize include neonate since study include intervention - A nurse physician coordinator well data quality manager designate unit . At national level • The country coordinator provide data national guideline treat prevent procedural continuous pain neonate . Data collection - The duration data collection every include infant 28 day . However , data collection stop 28 day infant leaf unit ( discharge , death , transfer another hospital ) . - Data collect individual data collection form . These form include demographic data , mode respiration , continuous intermittent sedative , analgesic neuro-blocking drug , pain assessment drug withdrawal practice . - Paper patient data collection form write English subtitle translation country language . The web-based database display questionnaire country language . - The data collection form complete unit nurse physician coordinator person designate . - For center , duration inclusion period one month . - Data enter secure web-based questionnaire . 1.7 Justification number patient Regarding number neonate include order show possible difference sedation analgesia practice among participate European country , consider scenario difference small . Thus , chosen effect size ( W ) 0.1 . We also assume 15 country participate . Using NCSS-PASS 2008 software , find total sample size 2303 neonate achieve 90 % power detect effect size ( W ) 0.1 use 14 degree ( 15 center ) freedom Chi-Square test significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 . Therefore , aim include average 154 neonate per participate country . 1.8 Main Actions carry study - In country , National Principal Investigators ( NPI ) send invitation join study level 3 neonatal unit country . The NPI communicate name , email telephone number unit accept participate EUROPAIN STUDY principal investigator - The NPI responsible coordination unit country ensure communication EUROPAIN STUDY principal investigator - The NPI collect demographic data participate country . - A nurse physician coordinator well data quality manager designate unit . The nurse physician coordinator responsible inform unit staff study . - The EUROPAIN STUDY principal investigator prepare specifically design web-based database enter data . Data enter directly patient 's file . A paper copy database distribute allow center prefer perform preliminary entry paper form enter data web-based database . The medical coordinator person ( ) choose enter data specifically design database . - The physician coordinator report general statistic unit number bed , number admission , year ventilator-days etc Europain study principal investigator . - Every unit also report exist local guideline sedation analgesia ventilate infant , include routine withdrawal use pain assessment tool . - MONITORING PANEL . A monitoring panel create monitor progress study . This panel ensure communication participate unit . This monitoring panel constitute two person work full-time study period . They station Paris work responsibility EUROPAIN STUDY principal investigator .</detailed_description>
