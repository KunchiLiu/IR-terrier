	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective present study evaluate effect high soy protein diet insulin resistance glycemic control participant characteristic metabolic syndrome . Secondly , present study evaluate whether reduce low-grade inflammation possible mechanism underlie improvement insulin resistance glucose homeostasis . Finally , assess whether soy protein beneficial effect component metabolic syndrome , cardio-metabolic risk factor , blood lipid profile , blood pressure endothelial function , fat storage liver gene-expression subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue . Study design : Single-blind , cross-over strictly-controlled dietary intervention .</detailed_description>
