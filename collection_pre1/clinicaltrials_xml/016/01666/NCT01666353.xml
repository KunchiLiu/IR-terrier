	<brief_summary>This study aim develop method quantitative image solid tumor patient receive immunotherapy delay mechanism action . PET image [ 18F ] 2-deoxy-2- ( 18F ) fluoro-D-glucose ( FDG ) potent diagnostic tool able detect melanoma tumor , undetectable CT. FDG PET use commonly detect melanoma human melanomas quite consistently high glucose metabolism . PET FDG image response tumor therapy , extensively evaluate melanoma immunotherapy melanoma . PET show highly predictive outcome patient follow radioimmunotherapy lymphoma , show change tumor glycolysis early 7 day immunotherapy initiation . In order develop PET/CT tool detect early evidence response patient solid tumor receive immune checkpoint blockade , investigator propose perform PET/CT image prior therapy , day 21 28 , finally 4 month post-treatment initiation . Each scan assess qualitatively quantitatively . Investigators use PERCIST criterion determine peak maximum standardized uptake value correct lean body mass ( SUL ) tumor , tumor volume , tumor total glycolytic volume , use CT PET/CT measure tumor size immune RECIST criterion . ( See section Outcome Evaluation . ) Investigators assess whether early change tumor metabolism see FDG PET predictive progression free overall survival outcome . Through systematic pilot study , investigator hope good link FDG PET measurement individual patient response immune checkpoint blockade therapy well understand refine emerge often effective therapeutic approach .</brief_summary>
