	<brief_summary>Milking umbilical cord placental end toward infant show benefit preterm infant compare either clamp umbilical cord immediately wait delay clamping cord . Delaying cord clamp 30-120 second show improve heart lung function , reduces need blood transfusion , reduces risk brain bleeding see preterm infant . Delaying clamp umbilical cord , however extremely premature infant consider safe , since also delay resuscitation infant need immediately birth . Milking umbilical cord believe similar benefit delay clamping cord , do much faster ( second rather minute ) . In study , cord milk three time 10-20 second infant pass await newborn medical team routine care . Participants study randomly assign one two study group : first group cord milk intervention second group intervention routine , immediate cord clamp routine care mother infant . Data collect mother prior delivery data also collect baby use computerized health record . The data look short term change red blood cell volume , need blood transfusion , rate know complication prematurity , include long term developmental complication 18-24 month . The hypothesis milk umbilical cord cut cord lead high hemoglobin concentration decrease need blood transfusion extremely preterm neonate compare current standard immediately clamp umbilical cord .</brief_summary>
