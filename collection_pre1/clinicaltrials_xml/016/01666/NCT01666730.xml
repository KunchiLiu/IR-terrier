	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well metformin hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . Metformin hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving metformin hydrochloride together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Plus Modified FOLFOX 6 Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) add FOLFOX ( leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ) improve overall survival patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( RR ) . II . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . To assess toxicity patient metastatic pancreatic cancer receive FOLFOX metformin . IV . To identify tumor/serum correlative marker . OUTLINE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 introductory period addition FOLFOX . After introductory period , patient continue metformin twice daily FOLFOX therapy comprise leucovorin calcium intravenously ( IV ) 120 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour , oxaliplatin IV 120 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
