	<brief_summary>Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCs ) epithelial carcinoma high frequency EGF-R expression . EGFR important regulator tumour progression proliferation several type cancer . Mechanism action Lapatinib EGFR and/or HER2 express oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) cell attribute inhibition cell proliferation induction apoptosis . Based data oesophageal SCCs investigator hypothesise EGFR signal pathway interaction play important role SCC pathogenesis represent good therapeutic target tumour . Primary Objectives : To evaluate tumour response macroscopically patient primary cutaneous SCC lesion concomitant SCC situ ( AK ) . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate tolerability single dose regimen systemic lapatinib therapy patient SCC measure time first AE SAE within study period . - To investigate molecular tumour response squamous cell carcinoma lesion patient lapatinib treatment use set variable . - Trial medicinal product</brief_summary>
