	<brief_summary>Bilateral internal thoracic artery ( BITA ) demonstrate superiority graft leave coronary system term patency survival benefit . Several BITA configuration propose left-sided myocardial revascularization , ideal BITA assemblage still unidentified . From 03/2003 08/2006 , 1297 consecutive patient underwent isolated bypass surgery institution . 481 patient meet inclusion criterion randomization 304 ( 64 % ) randomize . Patients allocate BITA situ grafting ( n=147 ) Y configuration ( n=152 ) evaluate clinical , functional , angiographic outcome 6 month , 3 7 year . Patient telephone interview conduct every 3 month stress test perform twice yearly refer cardiologist 's supervision . Angiographic follow-up perform 6 month surgery . The primary secondary end point , respectively , major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular event ( MACCE ) proportion ITA graft completely occlude follow-up angiography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between 2 Bilateral Internal Thoracic Artery Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Configurations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design All patient refer isolated surgical coronary revascularization April 2003 July 2006 screen accord inclusion criterion ( Table 1 ) . Patients randomly assign undergo one two alternative surgical strategy : BITA situ ( LITA LAD RITA marginal branch transverse sinus ) BITA Y ( LITA LAD RITA marginal branch anastomozed proximally LITA Y configuration describe Barra JA et al 3 ) . Randomization perform day operation patient 's record review without knowledge preoperative angiogram . Complementary grafting perform either saphenous vein graft pedicled right gastroepiloic artery depend location quality target coronary vessel , also depend surgeon 's choice . All patient schedule systematic angiography 6 36 month follow surgery . All patient give write informed consent time bypass surgery angiographic investigation . The study protocol approve Ethics Committee institution . Patients From 2003 2006 , 1297 consecutive patient underwent isolated bypass surgery institution . Of , 481 patient ( 37 % ) meet inclusion criterion enrolment study ( Figure 1 ) . Three hundred four 481 patient ( 63 % ) actually randomize . The remain 177 patient randomize ) refusal systematic angiographic control ( 85 % ) b ) logistic incapacity randomize patient ( 15 % ) . BITA graft perform situ configuration 147 patient Y configuration 152 . Five patient initially allocate BITA situ group exclude protocol violation . In case , surgeon decide deviate assign revascularisation strategy favor BITA Y configuration . Patient 's demographic clinical characteristic show Table 2 . The BITA harvest graft previously describe 4-5 . Operative characteristic detail Table 3 . Postoperative management follow-up Patients receive prophylactic low dose fractionate heparin postoperatively , 160 mg aspirin daily start postoperative day 2 . Patients interview telephone 3 6 month twice yearly thereafter . If patient hospitalize interview , in-patient record obtain . Patients systematic stress test cycloergometer twice year perform supervision refer cardiologist . Follow-up angiography schedule 6 month 3 year surgery . Nitroglycerin ( 2 mg ) inject graft filming . At least two orthogonal view ITA graft obtain , continue exposure require visualize distal runoff size target coronary bed . Data analysis The clinical end point occurrence MACCE define combined end-point include : death cause ; perioperative myocardial infarction ( occur 0 30 day ) ; late myocardial infarction ( occur 31 day 6 year ) ; additional cardiac surgery ; coronary angioplasty ; stroke . Myocardial infarction define apparition new Q wave , rise 10 ng / ml troponin early post operative period episode chest pain typical rise fall cardiac enzymes thereafter . The angiographic end point proportion ITA graft completely occlude follow-up angiography . Complete occlusion define absence visible opacification target coronary vessel ( TIMI flow grade 0 ) . All postoperative angiogram independently review 2 investigator ; discrepancy patency definition review third investigator resolve consensus . Statistical analysis We calculate enrolment least 152 patient per group would provide study 80 % power detect relative reduction 8 % rate graft occlusion , estimate 10 % BITA Y graft 6 2 % BITA situ 7 grafting , assume 20 % within-patient correlation graft occlusion , two-tailed test , alpha value 0.05 . Data express mean Â± 1 SD . In bivariate analysis , association independent variables outcome variable test Chi square test independent sample ( binary variable ) . All p-values two-tailed . The Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS , 9.1 release , SAS Institute Inc. , SAS Campus Drive , Cary , NC USA ) use statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
