	<brief_title>Effect Radiation Tissue Delayed Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In set post-mastectomy radiation therapy delay autologous reconstruction , favor many attempt avoid complication encounter radiate immediately reconstruct breast . The timing delay reconstruction however know . The goal proposal study gross , structural vascular change radiate mastectomy skin addition possible structural flow change underlie internal mammary vessel time . We plan use objective finding basis determine ideal time frame delay autologous breast reconstruction . Sequential mastectomy skin specimen obtain 20 patient undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy 24 month period specimen evaluate histologically . These patient also undergo serial examination photographic documentation gross skin change . Skin perfusion assess laser Doppler image internal mammary vessel structure , flow characteristic assess color Doppler sonography . Based study , elucidate short long term change radiate breast skin , show inflammatory , structural perfusion pattern correlate optimal condition reconstruction . This potential dramatically change practice pattern delay reconstruction many reconstructive surgeon importantly restore patient loose mastectomy consistent , timely fashion . There also potential improve outcome delay breast reconstruction decrease number reconstruction perform soon completion radiation .</detailed_description>
