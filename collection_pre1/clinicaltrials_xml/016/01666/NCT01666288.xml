	<brief_summary>Anaphylaxis define serious allergic reaction mediate IgE often difficult diagnose due wide heterogeneity clinical manifestation . The inciting agent often difficult pinpoint may include food , environmental allergen patient undergo allergen immunotherapy , insect sting , medication . Evidence allergy demonstration positive skin test inciting agent , helpful skin test available . The diagnostic modality useful diagnosis anaphylaxis IgE skin test available incite agent unknown , elevated serum tryptase level . However , diagnosis anaphylaxis make without tryptase level tryptase level normal . A simple , non-invasive test patient anaphylaxis currently available would helpful diagnose guide management option . Patients develop anaphylaxis environmental allergen venom routine outpatient subcutaneous allergen venom immunotherapy ideal population study able evaluate specific reaction control , clinical environment . Although anaphylaxis uncommon , incidence estimate vary 0.01 4 percent allergy injection . Subcutaneous allergen venom immunotherapy well establish form therapy patient allergic rhinitis , allergic asthma , confirm sensitivity sting insect . Serial blood sample perform group patient reaction baseline one week reaction , thereby allow patient serve biological control . Metabolomics study metabolic pathway unique biochemical molecule result regulatory response physiological stressor , disease process , drug therapy , allergen venom immunotherapy . By measure change metabolite concentration , range biochemical effect therapeutic intervention determine . The investigator plan use metabolic profiling blood sample collect time anaphylaxis one week , see simple , non-invasive test patient anaphylaxis could develop .</brief_summary>
