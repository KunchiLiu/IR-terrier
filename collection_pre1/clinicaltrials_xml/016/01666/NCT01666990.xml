A chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . However , still unknown whether reduce immune activation restore CD4 T cell count lead immune reconstitution chronic HIV infection . Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F ( TwHF ) demonstrate decrease immune activation host , suppress inflammation human disease . Here , investigator propose hypothesis TwHF reduce immune over-activation subsequently lead restoration CD4 T-cell count immune reconstitution HIV-infected immune non-responders .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F ( TwHF ) Treatment Immune Non-responders With HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although HIV-1 infection characterize progressive depletion CD4+ T cell eventually lead clinically significant immunodeficiency , chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . In particular , immune activation identify disease determinant independent viral load cell death HIV-1 infection . A series clinical evidence indicate activated CD8 T cell may attack body cell infected virus . Because , CD4 cell infect HIV frequently destroy CD8 cell . In traditional Chinese medicine , extract roots medicinal vine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F ( TwHF ) ( know China `` lei gong teng '' `` thunder god vine '' ) show therapeutic promise treat autoimmune inflammatory condition well cancer . In extract , three diterpenoids—triptolide , tripdiolide , triptonide—are abundant account immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory effect observe vitro vivo study . Recently , different extract TwHF use Chinese allopathic medicine treatment autoimmune inflammatory disease , small control trial report good response TwHF extract patient cadaveric kidney transplant Crohn disease . In particular , multicenter , double-blind , active comparator trial standardize TwHF extract patient active rheumatoid arthritis show 20 % improvement American College Rheumatology criterion patient TwHF sulfasalazine . Thus , TwHF may reduce inflammatory response promote tissue recovery human disease . The purpose study learn whether well TwHF reduces level activation CD8 cell people infect HIV . The decreased activation CD8 cell may lead CD4 T cell restoration immune reconstitution HIV infection . This study also look well TwHF tolerate safety HIV- infected patient . Participants study randomly assign one two treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive 48 week TwHF treatment . Arm B : Participants receive 48 week placebo Study treatment give 20 mg , three time per day full 48 week . After treatment start , participant ask come clinic Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 36 , 48 . At visit participant receive enough study treatment last next visit . Each visit last 2 3 hour . At visit participant physical exam , answer question medication take feeling , blood drawn safety ass CD4/CD8 cell count viral load . Some additional blood also store immunology testing . At visit participant ask question medication medical history , pupil dilate , hear test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Some visit require participant arrive fasting . Pregnancy test may also conduct participant able become pregnant pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
