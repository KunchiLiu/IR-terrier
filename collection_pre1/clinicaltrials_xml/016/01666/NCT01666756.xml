	<brief_title>Chinese Herbal Formulation PHY906 Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability KD018 ( Chinese herbal formulation PHY906 ) combination daily sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination KD018 plus sorafenib bring forward phase 2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe efficacy combination KD018 plus sorafenib explored dose-levels term best overall response define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline . II . To assess safety tolerability combination KD018 plus sorafenib measure rate severity adverse event ( AEs ) . III . To determine steady state sorafenib KD018 exposure pre-dose 1 hour 2 hour post-dose explored combination dose-levels use concentration pre-dose ( Cmin ) 1 hour ( C1h ) 2 hour ( C2h ) post-dose . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect treatment soluble marker angiogenesis , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , placental growth factor ( PLGF ) , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( sVEGFR1 ) , sVEGFR2 , apoptosis ( i.e . M30 monoclonal antibody [ M30 ] M65 ) insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) axis include molecule IGF-binding protein 2 ( IGFII ) . II . To correlate soluble biomarker measurement clinical endpoint . III . To examine correlation soluble biomarkers . IV . To examine predictive relationship immunohistochemical tumor biomarkers baseline , i.e . phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( pS6 ) , p-protein kinase B ( pAKT ) , p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) , p-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( pMEK ) , hypoxia-inducible factor 2 , alpha subunit ( HIF2a ) , phosphatase tensin homolog gene ( PTEN ) , signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( acute-phase response factor ) ( STAT3 ) tumor protein p53 ( p53 ) , well mutational status , i.e . p53 , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) PTEN , efficacy endpoint ( time progression [ TTP ] ) . V. To determine soluble apoptosis marker ( M30/M65 ) correlate proliferative marker baseline ( proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen [ Ki67 ] p53 ) archival tumor sample . VI . To examine relationship immunohistochemical and/or soluble biomarkers subgroup classification namely , patient hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) patient etiology . VII . To explore potential biomarker difference within patient subgroup , namely , patient HBV , patient HCV patient etiology . VIII . To determine effect KD018 cytokine/chemokine level include interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , interferon ( IFN ) -alpha , VEGF , FGF-basic ( b ) , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) . IX . To explore potential relationship efficacy Cmin sorafenib co-administration KD018 occurrence adverse event C1h/C2h endpoint ( efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics [ PK ] ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study Chinese herbal formulation PHY906 . Patients receive Chinese herbal formulation PHY906 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 , 21-24 sorafenib tosylate PO BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
