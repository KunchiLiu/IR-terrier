	<detailed_description>Modern medical therapy Crohn 's disease , include immunomodulators biologic compound , revolutionized disease treatment . However , significant portion individual respond medication , often due development intestinal fibrosis . Over course Crohn 's disease repeat episode inflammation abnormal wound heal lead progressive intestinal fibrosis , stricture , bowel obstruction . While inflammatory Crohn 's disease often respond medical therapy , predominantly fibrostenotic intestinal disease unresponsive require surgery . Our inability accurately distinguish intestinal inflammation fibrosis frequently lead empiric trial steroid immunosuppressive therapy . This often prove futile , delay inevitable surgery , unnecessarily expose patient medication-related risk month sometimes year . At present available mean distinguish medically responsive inflammatory disease predominately fibrotic intestinal disease . The unmet need field accurate diagnostic technology determine patient benefit anti-inflammatory therapy , patient go directly surgery . Non-invasive ultrasound stiffness imaging ( USI ) may surrogate marker underlie bowel wall fibrosis aid predict Crohn 's disease responsive medical therapy . Two USI method recently develop : Ultrasound elasticity imaging ( UEI ) use 2D speckle-tracking measure tissue strain , surrogate fibrosis . The second , shear wave image ( SWI ) , commercially available technology measure speed ultrasonic shear wave tissue . Shear wave travel rapidly stiff tissue . The central hypothesis proposal ultrasound stiffness imaging ( USI ) quantitatively distinguish predominately inflammatory fibrotic bowel wall thickening , therefore predictive likelihood response medical therapy need surgery . We plan objectively test central hypothesis attain objective application pursue follow three specific aim : Specific Aim 1 ( SA-1 ) : Determine USI stiffness measurement intestinal stricture Crohn 's patient admit small bowel obstruction predict response failure medical therapy base CDAI objective inflammatory biomarkers index hospitalization 90 day follow-up . Inpatient Inclusion Criteria : - Subjects must 18 year age old - Previous diagnosis Crohn 's disease image demonstrate involvement ileum - Hospital admission image demonstrate small bowel dilation ( &gt; 3.5 cm ) - CDAI score &gt; 220 . Inpatient Exclusion Criteria : - Active Clostridium difficile colitis/enteritis - Presence abdominal enterocutaneous fistula ultrasound path . - Prior abdominal hernia repair mesh placement ultrasound path . Specific Aim 2 ( SA-2 ) : Determine USI stiffness measurement diseased ileum Crohn 's outpatient start Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha therapy predict response medical therapy base CDAI objective inflammatory biomarkers . Outpatient Inclusion Criteria - Crohn 's patient age 18 start anti-TNF therapy - CDAI score &gt; 220 denote clinical disease activity . Outpatient Exclusion Criteria : - Active Clostridium difficile colitis/enteritis - Presence abdominal enterocutaneous fistula ultrasound path - Prior abdominal hernia repair mesh placement ultrasound path - Current use prednisone budesonide - Changing anti-TNF due allergy ( include TNF-induced lupus-like arthritis ) .</detailed_description>
