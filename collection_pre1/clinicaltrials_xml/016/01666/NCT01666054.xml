	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis reduce patient-ventilator asynchrony reduce time require wean mechanical ventilation . The purpose pilot study ( 1 ) ass study feasibility term recruitment , protocol adherence efficacy intervention reduce asynchrony , ( 2 ) ass baseline rate asynchrony outcome control arm order perform sample size calculation , need , , large study design detect difference wean time specific , predefined population ( 3 ) examine often ineffective trigger ( therefore reduce ventilator respiratory rate ) high level pressure support lead false conclusion high level support need diminish respiratory distress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Weaning Pressure Support v . Proportional Assist Ventilation : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research show approximately twenty-five percent patient capable trigger ventilator assist mode high rate patient-ventilator asynchrony , patient long duration mechanical ventilation . It know whether asynchrony cause wean failure simply marker severe respiratory failure . The common type asynchrony , ineffective triggering , may marker respiratory disease cause delay wean . During ineffective triggering , patient 's inspiratory effort fail trigger ventilator breath , thus respiratory rate display ventilator underestimate patient 's true , intrinsic respiratory rate . Since ineffective trigger common high level pressure support low level , increase respiratory rate weaning pressure support may indicate development respiratory distress simply abolition ineffective triggering . Ineffective triggering may also cause delayed wean respiratory muscle energy `` wasted '' non-supported breath . Proportional assist ventilation ( PAV ) FDA- HPB-approved mode ventilation ventilator apply pressure proportion patient effort . Using PAV , patient-ventilator interaction may optimize ineffective trigger greatly reduce . Since patient ventilator respiratory rate generally equivalent , reduction respiratory rate increase ventilatory support less likely false positive indication need great assistance . In study , patient difficulty wean mechanical ventilation randomize wean one two weaning protocol : Proportional Assist Ventilation ( PAV ) wean algorithm ( intervention arm ) vs. Pressure Support Ventilation ( PSV ) wean algorithm ( control arm ) .</detailed_description>
