	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation intensive therapy use improve survivorship cure various oncologic disease . However , therapy associate high mortality rate numerous negative side-effects . The recovery immune system special concern play key role success treatment . In healthy population know exercise play important role immune system regulation , little known role exercise hematological immunological recovery child undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant . The Primary objective Randomized Controlled Trial : study effect exercise program immune cell recovery patient undergo autologous stem cell transplantation . The Secondary objective determine exercise intervention might diminish deterioration quality life , physical fitness , acquisition sedentary lifestyle . Methods Twenty-four participant treat malignancy autologous stem cell transplant ( 5 18 year ) Alberta Children 's Hospital randomly assign exercise control group . The exercise group participate two-phase exercise intervention ( outpatient ) hospitalization 10 week discharge . The exercise program include strength , flexibility aerobic exercise . During inpatient phase program perform 5 times/week supervise . The outpatient phase combine supervise session two home-based exercise session use Wii device . The control group follow standard protocol without specific exercise program . A range outcomes , include quantitative functional recovery immune system , cytokine level serum , NK cell subset recovery function , gene expression activate inhibitory NK cell receptor , body composition , nutrition , quality life , fatigue , health-related fitness assessment physical activity level examine , provide comprehensive assessment date . Discussion We expect find improvement immunological recovery , quality life , decreased acquisition sedentary behavior less fitness deconditioning .</brief_summary>
