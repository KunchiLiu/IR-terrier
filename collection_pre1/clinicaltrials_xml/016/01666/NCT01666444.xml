	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare overall survival patient treat VTX-2337 + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) versus treat PLD alone woman recurrent persistent , epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . VTX-2337 , small molecule agonist Toll-like Receptor 8 ( TLR8 ) , activate multiple component innate immune system develop novel therapeutic agent use oncology . Experimental data obtain animal model ovarian cancer support combination VTX-2337 PLD . In model , combination VTX-2337 PLD result significant reduction tumor growth compare either agent alone increase number T lymphocytes infiltrate tumor . The combination PLD VTX-2337 test small number woman ovarian cancer Phase 1b study appear generally well-tolerated .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VTX-2337 Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin ( PLD ) Patients With Recurrent Persistent Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives : - To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient treat VTX-2337 + PLD versus treat PLD alone woman recurrent persistent , epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) two treatment group use Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) . Secondary Objectives : - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) two treatment group use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) . - To compare nature , frequency severity drug-related adverse event ( AEs ) two treatment group . Exploratory Objectives : - To compare best overall response rate ( ORR ) duration response ( base probability response function [ PBRF ] ) two treatment group use irRECIST RECIST 1.1 . - To compare disease control rate ( DCR ) two treatment group use irRECIST RECIST 1.1 . - To assess impact immune status response clinical effect ( OS , PFS , DCR , ORR , PBRF , AEs ) study treatment . - To assess effect TLR8 polymorphism BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation clinical effect ( OS , PFS , DCR , ORR , PBRF , AEs ) study treatment . - To assess effect immune cell subset , measure immunohistochemistry micro RNA primary tumor tissue ( e.g . immune score ) , clinical effect ( OS , PFS , DCR , ORR , PBRF , AEs ) study treatment . - To assess whether presence autoantibody tumor-derived protein predictive clinical effect ( OS , PFS , DCR , ORR , PBRF , AEs ) study treatment . OUTLINE : This Phase 2 multicenter clinical study evaluate efficacy safety combination VTX-2337 + PLD compare PLD + Placebo . The dose schedule treatment arm , base 28-day cycle . The start dose schedule PLD Day 1 plus VTX-2337 placebo Day 3 , Day 10 , Day 17 first 4 cycle . Starting cycle 5 , dose regimen PLD Day 1 plus VTX-2337 placebo Day 3 . Blood sample collect periodically cycle 1 pharmacodynamics , pharmacogenomics , research study . Patients receive therapy disease progression base Immune-Related RECIST adverse effect prohibit therapy . Following treatment completion , patient follow physical exam history every three month first two year , every six month next three year ,</detailed_description>
