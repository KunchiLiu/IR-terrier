	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine feasibility , efficacy safety automate closed-loop glucose control home set short term period . The data experience gain study utilise plan future home study . This open-label , three centre , randomise , crossover design , involve two , 8 day ( first day clinical research facility seven day home ) study period glucose level control either automate closed-loop system subject usual insulin pump therapy random order . A total 24 adult ( aim 18 completed subject ) age 18 year old T1D insulin pump therapy recruit diabetes clinic establish method participate centre . Subjects receive appropriate training safe use closed-loop insulin delivery system . During 24 hour in-patient stay subject encourage mimic usual day allow walk inside hospital premise . Subjects advise discontinue automate closed-loop insulin delivery follow usual insulin pump therapy period strenuous exercise 7 day home study phase . The primary outcome time spend target range 3.9 10.0 mmol/L record CGM ( adjust potential over-estimation ) home stay . Secondary outcome time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric , stay clinical research facility , time spend target range , target range measure plasma glucose .</brief_summary>
