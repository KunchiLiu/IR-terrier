	<brief_summary>Background : Lower limb arterial revascularization procedure , either percutaneously surgically perform , establish treatment modality ischemic foot ulcer , especially set critical limb ischemia . Many low limb ulcer secondary combine disease , may include concomitant venous disease ( chronic venous insufficiency varicous disease ) micro-angiopathic disease ( i.e . small vessel disease ) . In set , especially absence concomitant severe macro-angiopathic disease , safety efficacy percutaneous low limb revascularization far never evaluate prospective study . Aim : This study aim evaluate safety efficacy endovascular revascularization approach lower limb , consecutive patient present non-healing ulcer associate mild moderate peripheral artery disease ( i.e . mixed-origin ulcer ) . Material method : This prospective study consecutively include patient present non-healing ulcer . Included patient must concomitant ulcer co-factors adequately treat least 6 month . Accordingly , underlie venous disease , infectious disease inflammatory disorder must previously evaluate adequately treat ( i.e . compression stocking , varix strip , antibiotic , local ± systemic anti-inflammatory , etc. ) . Furthermore , non-invasive arterial evaluation must obtain patient . The arterial screening must include ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) toe pressure ( TP ) measurement , trans-cutaneous oxygen measurement ( tcPO2 ) foot calf level non-invasive arterial mapping ( i.e . angio-CT angio-MRI ) . This arterial work-up must compatible presence mild moderate peripheral artery disease without sign criterion suggest presence critical limb ischemia . End-points : The success rate perform endovascular revascularization intervention consecutive patient qualify accord inclusion criterion ( technical feasibility ) . Establish proportion procedural related complication ( safety ) . Analyze clinical para-clinical improvement term heal ulcer , well improvement ABI , TP , tcPO2 1 week , 1-3-6 month procedure ( efficacy ) . Sample size : The investigator plan include ≈ 30 patient two year . After 1 year enrollment investigator perform interim analysis decide moment , accord observe end-points , prolong study would scientific value study interrupt earlier significant improvement already treat ulcer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients need least 18 year old 2 . Patients admit university hospital Geneva nonhealing low limb ulcer . Eligible patient present nonhealing low limb ulcer 3 month . Patients hospitalize Dermatology inpatient clinic . Patients benefit least one thin skin autograft ulcer level past index hospitalization . 3 . Before inclusion study , patient must undergo complete angiological diagnostic workup include : A baseline ABI , toe pressure tcPO2 measurement , A noninvasive arterial image include angioCT scan angioMRI , 4 . The noninvasive arterial workup must revel mild moderate PAD , without criterion sign CLI ( see flowchart ) : Ankle pressure ≥ 50 mmHg , + ABI : &lt; 0.9 &gt; 1.3 , ± Toe pressure : 30100 mmHg ± tcPO2 : 2040 mmHg , At moment patient may include study protocol . 5 . All patient present mild moderate PAD evidence least 1 impaired arterial vessel target ulcer initially undergo conservative impatient clinic care least 24 week benefit least 1 thin skin autograft . Persisting surface low limb ulcer assess 1 month later : In presence heal ulcer surface &gt; 70 % , patient undergo 6 month clinical follow 136 month . 1 . In case persistence heal ulcer surface &gt; 70 % clinical success achieve . 2 . In presence heal ulcer surface &lt; 70 % patient undergo new angiological workup . If mild moderate PAD outline patient join &lt; 70 % healed ulcer group . On hand , CLI point low limb revascularisation least one thin skin autograft perform . In presence heal ulcer surface &lt; 70 % , endovascular PTA least one thin skin autograft perform . The ulcer heal monitor 136 month persist ulcer surface reassess : presence heal ulcer surface &gt; 70 % clinical success achieve , presence heal ulcer surface &lt; 70 % clinical failure retain . 1 . Patients refuse give write informed consent . 2 . Patients , angiological workup show presence CLI , mandate revascularization procedure attempt ( i.e . ankle pressure &lt; 50mmHg , toe pressure &lt; 30mmHg , tcPO2 &lt; 20mmHg ) ( see particular situation n°2 ) . 3 . Patients present peripheral artery disease ( i.e. , ABI &gt; 0.9 &lt; 1.3 , TP &gt; 100mmHg , tcPO2 &gt; 40mmHg ) . 4 . Patients angiologicaldermatological workup show presence another reversible cause nonhealing ulcer : Special attention give presence treatable venous insufficiency ( e.g . compression stocking , varix strip ) , underlie inflammatory/infectious process ( treatable antibiotic topicsystemic antiinflammatory medication ) reversible mechanical factor ( unadapted shoe , etc. ) . 5 . Patients without significant lesion arterial tree ( iliofemoropopliteal infrapopliteal ) : In case single BTK vessel disease perfuse ulcer area ( e.g . pretibial ulcer significant stenosis posterior tibial artery perfuse ulcer region ) , patient include study significant ulcer improvement would expect nontarget vessel revascularization . 6 . Patients schedule revascularization procedure judge risky patient 's safety : Chronic kidney failure ( = Creatinin Clearance &lt; 20ml/min ) increase risk contrast induce nephropathy , Too complex arterial disease anatomy , estimate procedural technical success rate &lt; 50 % ( i.e . complex chronic total occlusion ) . 7 . Patients amputation unavoidable , despite revascularization attempt ( e.g . extensive skin necrosis [ Rutherford class 6 ] ) , If , estimate , successful revascularization procedure may reduce level amputation , successful intervention may improve amputation 's healing process , patient may include study .</criteria>
