	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common solid tumor , approximately 200,000 new case diagnose per year . Several different local therapy available treatment , include surgery radiotherapy Significant advance make technical aspect surgery radiotherapy improve cancer control outcomes well morbidity treatment . Despite significant advance , approximately 30 % patient treat definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease . Recurrent disease prostatectomy usually manifest rise PSA ( blood test prostate cancer ) . The PSA level often limited use differentiate local recurrence ( ie . recurrence prostate bed ) recurrence outside prostate bed ( extra-prostatic recurrence ) . One PET radiotracer show promise stag restaging patient prostate carcinoma anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid ( anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC ) synthetic amino acid analog . FACBC demonstrate high accuracy compare 111Indium-capromab-pendetide restaging patient suspect recurrent prostate carcinoma . The major goal propose investigation use advance molecular imaging well guide post-prostatectomy decision making , term guide decision deliver radiotherapy , term exact area treat radiotherapy . Investigators perform study 162 patient strong suspicion prostate cancer return body prostatectomy . Half patient radiotherapy decision-making delivery per usual routine , half patient radiotherapy decision volume guide FACBC test . The major goal investigation see whether FACBC improve selection cancer control rate post-surgery patient rise PSA undergo radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
