	<brief_summary>In infant hospitalize bronchiolitis , common infection lung cause virus , uncertain best monitor oxygen level . It common place probe infant hand legs monitor oxygen level . The probe use monitor oxygen level time ( continuous oxygen monitoring ) every 4-6 hour ( intermittent oxygen monitoring ) . There reason believe place child bronchiolitis continuous monitoring might result child stay long hospital need . This research study aim provide data plan large research study answer question whether intermittent oxygen monitoring well continuous oxygen monitoring . This study part large initiative determine best way care child bronchiolitis , include make sure child stay hospital longer need . Parents ask participate research study child hospitalize bronchiolitis stable least 6 hour , mean he/she trouble breathe require supplemental oxygen . If agree participate , child one two oxygen monitoring strategy : intermittent continuous monitoring . Each child equal chance get one two monitoring strategy . The study team review child 's chart determine number test order , need intensive care unit help admission , number blood test chest x-rays treating doctor order , length hospital stay . Parents contact 4-5 day discharge ask unscheduled visit doctor emergency room discharge . The investigator parent fill scale twice day ask well child feeding . The investigator also rate anxiety level day . The information study help plan support application external funding . The result large study could potentially decrease unnecessary monitoring , oxygen supplementation , hospital stay thereby improve quality care large cost saving . A reduction length hospital stay common hospital condition would also reduce burden hospitalization family reduce risk associate harm hospital set infection medical error .</brief_summary>
