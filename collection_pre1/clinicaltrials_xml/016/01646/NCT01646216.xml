	<brief_title>Long Term Split Belt Treadmill Training Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coordination legs walk often disrupt neurological injury , result asymmetric gait pattern . Recent data show walk pattern alter treadmill training , even central nervous system damage . The investigator study short-term adaptation inter-limb coordination walk use split-belt treadmill control speed two leg independently . Our finding demonstrate walk pattern adaptable . The investigator also show people cerebral damage stroke benefit short-term correct asymmetric walking pattern . Since previous work focus single training session 4 week training session , investigator would like study long-term effect split belt treadmill train . Therefore , purpose study prepare clinical trial split-belt treadmill train treat walk pattern deficit cerebral damage . The investigator gather data determine whether different type treadmill train custom split-belt treadmill likely change/improve walk symmetry well metabolic efficiency . The investigator study adult cerebral damage due stroke . Subjects hemiparesis undergo training 3 time week total 33 training session . These 33 session break 3 block 11 session . After block 11 session evaluation do record gait improvement . Training subject hemiparesis either conventional treadmill walk ( legs move speed ) split-belt treadmill walk ( one leg move faster ) . These study provide important new information normal mechanism locomotor adaptation , well provide new rehabilitation tool people asymmetric gait pattern . Note study aerobic condition program since subject work well age-adjusted target heart rate ; instead retrain program aim teach people new inter-limb coordination pattern well determine whether train influence subject 's body 's ability use intake oxygen efficiently . This study also critical develop procedural reliability process , calculate effect size , train clinical staff , determine salient clinical variable preparation randomize clinical trial .</detailed_description>
