	<brief_summary>Chronic wound cause significant morbidity cost healthcare system million dollar year.Their heal slow biofilms , community bacteria surround protective layer stop immune system antibiotic get close enough kill . The investigator develop new strategy destroy biofilms use protein make bacteria live skin.The Staphylococcus epidermidis Esp protein use destroy Staphylococcus aureus biofilms , common bacterium chronic wound . The investigator hypothesize use Esp protein breakdown S. aureus biofilms , decrease bacterial colonization chronic wound improve heal time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic wound lead significant patient morbidity mortality , treatment associate global economic burden $ 13- $ 15 billion annually . In Canada , average cost three month community care chronic wind $ 27,600.00 . One major complication associate chronic wound colonization Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) biofilm . These bacterial biofilms delay re-epithelialization prevent wound heal . Standard treatment chronic wound biofilms include aggressive debridement well addition anti-biofilm agent antimicrobial . Since antimicrobial resistance become serious problem , find alternative essential . Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) JK16 cell , culture supernatant serine protease ( Esp ) culture supernatant show inhibit formation destroy preexist S. aureus biofilms . The investigator hypothesize use S. epidermidis JK16 , culture supernatant purify Esp protein standard wound care protocol breakdown S. aureus biofilms , decrease bacterial colonization chronic wound improve heal time . The investigator employ two-way cross study participant receive standard wound care S. epidermidis JK16 Esp supplement treatment first 6 week follow cross 6 week . These patient recruit Wound Healing Clinic Vancouver General Hospital . Standard wind care provide accordance establish protocol base `` Best Clinical Practice Guidelines Venous Leg Ulcers '' Canadian Association Wound Care . For S. epidermidis JK16 Esp supplement treatment arm , investigator produce purified Esp impregnate wound dressing protein . After 6 week , participant cross correspond treatment arm . Our primary outcome measure heal rate calculate 6 week standard experimental treatment period . The investigator employ standardize photography wound image analysis software calculate healing rate . Other outcome measure include visual detection qualitative assessment biofilms determine trained nurse and/or physician . Finally , bacterial type quantity determine wound biopsy . Outcome measure standard treatment arm compare result S. epidermidis JK16 Esp supplement treatment arm . Objectives pilot study include : 1 . To assess feasibility conduct definitive trial examine efficacy S. epidermidis Esp protein strain JK16 heal chronic wound 2 . To perform pilot study use cross-over design purify S. epidermidis Esp protein strain JK16 comparison standard therapy 3 . To demonstrate intervention acceptable participant 4 . To demonstrate safety intervention 5 . To explore biologic activity S. epidermidis Esp protein strain JK16 wound biofilms heal time</detailed_description>
