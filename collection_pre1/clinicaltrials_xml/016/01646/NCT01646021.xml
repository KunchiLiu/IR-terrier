	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety ibrutinib versus temsirolimus patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma receive least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ibrutinib ( Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ) , Versus Temsirolimus Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Have Received Least One Prior Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign study treatment chance ) , open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) , study evaluate efficacy safety ibrutinib compare temsirolimus patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) receive least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen . Approximately 280 eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio stratify ( group ) number prior line therapy ( 1 2 versus &gt; =3 ) simplify MCL International Prognostic Index criterion receive either ibrutinib mouth ( Treatment Arm A ) temsirolimus intravenous infusion ( Treatment Arm B ) . The study consist screening , treatment , posttreatment phase . Data collect disease response treatment , progression-free survival , overall survival , subsequent anti-MCL therapy , patient report outcome , medical resource utilization . Tumor sample , blood collect multiple time point , bone marrow aspirate evaluate identify marker predictive response resistance ibrutinib . Serial pharmacokinetic ( study body drug ) sample collect detailed protocol . Safety monitor throughout study . Disease evaluation perform every 9 week 15 month start study drug , every 24 week thereafter , disease progression , death , clinical cutoff , whichever come first . Patients receive treatment temsirolimus disease progression ( confirmed Independent Review Committee ) may eligible crossover receive treatment ibrutinib 560 mg orally , daily , 21-day cycle disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end . Data analyze 3 year last patient enrol final follow-up .</detailed_description>
