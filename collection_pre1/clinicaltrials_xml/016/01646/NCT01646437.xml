	<brief_summary>The randomized 2x2x2 factorial design placebo control trial enroll 5000 participant ( woman 60 year old men 55 year old ) without know heart disease prior stroke without clear indication contraindication study medication . Eligible consent individual randomize receive either active study medication placebo ( dummy pill ) monitor average 5 year . The study include people 10 country , conduct international group scientist physicians coordinate Population Health Research Institute Hamilton Health Sciences .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The International Polycap Study 3 ( TIPS-3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , cancer osteoporosis collectively make large disease burden globally . CVD major cause death disability affect half population lifetimes . Cancers lead cause death account 13.0 % death . The common form include lung , breast , prostate , colorectum , stomach liver cancer . It estimate 200 hundred million people worldwide live osteoporosis . This underlie pathologic predisposition fracture hip , vertebral body , distal forearm . CVD , cancer osteoporotic fracture increase age burden expect substantially increase next decade . Simple , safe effective preventive strategy reduce incidence prevalence 3 disease therefore urgently need It suggest polypill could give individual CVD event well anyone 55 year ( primary prevention ) without need measurement risk factor . The polypill contain 3 blood pressure low medication statin single tablet . This include hydrochlorothiazide ( 25 mg ) , atenolol ( 100 mg ) , ramipril ( 10 mg ) simvastatin ( 40 mg ) . In addition , polypill ( Polycap ) , participant randomize receive aspirin ( 75mg ) vitamin D ( 60,000 IU monthly ) . This factorial design 3 distinct treatment arm could reduce CVD , fracture cancer could large implication prevention several important chronic disease middle old age , use safe inexpensive medications/supplements .</detailed_description>
