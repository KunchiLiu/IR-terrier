	<brief_summary>Background : - A challenge study expose person disease allow researcher study disease body 's healing process . An influenza challenge study look different amount flu virus provide information smallest amount need cause infection . Researchers want give one dose Influenza A H1N1 virus healthy volunteer see body responds virus . Objectives : - To find small dose Influenza A H1N1 virus may cause mild moderate flu infection healthy adult . - To study body immune system respond virus . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . - Participants must willing remain isolation minimum 9 day . Design : - Participants admit hospital inpatient isolation unit . They screen physical exam medical history . They also heart lung function test . Blood , urine , nasal swab/wash sample collect . - Participants receive single nasal spray flu virus . They stay inpatient unit least 9 day . - Participants monitor length stay . They frequent blood test procedure need . - Participants allow go home two negative test virus . The test give two consecutive day ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza A 2009 H1N1 Challenge Study Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high morbidity mortality associate pandemic seasonal influenza , anticipation future influenza pandemic , put influenza front center infectious disease research . Because natural history pathogenesis human influenza well characterize adequately study animal model current vitro technique , important question influenza pathogenesis approach human challenge study . Previous human challenge study address aspect natural history influenza evaluate time viral replication , shed , clinical symptom , innate adaptive immune response . Although study provide important information , United States , 1 perform prior 1990 . Without exception , study limitation due scope study and/or scientific technique available time . The primary objective study determine dose influenza A 2009 H1N1 human challenge virus induce mild moderate uncomplicated influenza infection healthy volunteer . This protocol examine basic question remain unanswered regard pathogenesis influenza human , namely , detailed clinical immunological characterization uncomplicated influenza viral pathogenesis healthy adult volunteer . Secondary objective evaluate clinical disease , length viral shedding , pathogenesis influenza infection include identification clinical marker disease . Notably , exploratory objective seek discover viral factor necessary human infection/adaptation evaluate host immune response , viral replication , viral fitness , intrahost evolution . Collaboration National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) investigator outside scientist generate opportunity develop expand area clinical influenza research base propose challenge model .</detailed_description>
