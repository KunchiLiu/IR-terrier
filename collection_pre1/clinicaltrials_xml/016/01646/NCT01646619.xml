	<detailed_description>Perinatal Asphyxia continue major cause neonatal mortality morbidity even technologically advanced prosperous country world . The incidence remain unchanged ; 1-2 % live birth develop world country much high develop world country . Perinatal Asphyxia multisystem disorder . Neonatal brain important organ affect Asphyxic insult result neuronal damage permanent . Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy ( HIE ) , pathognomonic clinical syndrome asphyxic neuronal insult , occur 50-60 % baby Perinatal Asphyxia . Moderate severe HIE cause significant neonatal mortality morbidity . Among patient moderate HIE , 10-20 % die 30-40 % develop neurological deficit , whereas 50 % patient severe HIE die almost survivor develop neurological deficit . Hence toll society continue high spite dramatic improvement neonatal intact survival , particularly developed world country . Until recent year , management HIE limit supportive intensive care specific treatment available rescue neuron HIE . However , last decade , therapeutic Hypothermia , emerge promising new therapy reduce neonatal mortality morbidity due HIE . This due improve understanding physiology neuronal damage asphyxia insult . Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy ( HIE ) dynamic process evolves period seventy two hour start time insult . Two distinct episode neuronal damage occur time : 1 . The immediate ( primary ) hypoxic insult follow 2. latent period recovery last almost six hour . This follow much long profound period secondary neuronal damage due release chemical mediator . Therapeutic modality potentially reduce release chemical mediator provide neuronal rescue . Moderate control hypothermia ( 33.5-34.5 0C ) offer first 72 hour asphyxic insult one therapeutic modality subject animal study well extensive multicenter trail human infant last two decade . The study animal model confirm safety moderate therapeutic hypothermia ; also show dramatic neuronal rescue experimental HIE model lamb subject prolonged therapeutic hypothermia immediately birth . This follow pilot RCT 's human infant ; outcomes encourage . However universal change practice require large well design multicenter trail Meta analysis . After establish therapeutic hypothermia safe effective modality neuroprotection HIE , neonatologists face new question . Can investigators enhance neuroprotective effect therapeutic hypothermia add potential neuroprotective agent ? These potential therapeutic agent include Xenon , Erythropoetin , Magnisium sulphate , Allopurinol , opoids , Topiramate , Inhaled Nitric Oxide ( iNO ) , N-Acetylcystine , Minocycline Melatonin.13,17 Due different mechanism action , likely neuroprotective therapy may add incrementally proven beneficial effect hypothermia . Indeed hypothermia may buy additional time neuroprotective agent act within expand 'therapeutic window'.13 These Hypothermia plus therapy go subject many new RCT 's worldwide next year . Magnesium Sulphate , potential neuroprotective agent , act reduce neuronal excitotoxicity . MgSO4 long use Obstertrics tocolytic agent proven neuroprotective effect preterm baby bear mother tocolyzed MgSO4 . A recently conduct RCT human neonate compare postnatal magnesium sulfate placebo management Neonatal HIE . This study , use hypothermia therapy due lack facility , show treatment MgSO4 improve neurologic outcome discharge term neonate severe perinatal asphyxia . The animal study do Knuckley 's group compare combination therapeutic hypothermia MgSO4 therapeutic hypothermia alone . In rat model MgSO4 alone minimal beneficial effect . However , MgSO4 plus hypothermia significant beneficial effect reduce size post asphyxia infarct . This animal focal stroke model provide intriguing suggestion hypothermia plus MgSO4 provide additive neuroprotection . No human study do far test difference therapeutic hypothermia alone therapeutic hypothermia plus MgSO4 . Mag Cool Study ( Hypothermia plus MgSO4 Vs Hypothermia plus placebo ) test hypothesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The baby assess sequentially criterion A , B C list : A . Evidence Perinatal Asphyxia birth : Infants â‰¥35 complete week gestation admit NICU least one following : 1 . Apgar score &lt; 5 10 minute birth 2 . Continued need resuscitation , include endotracheal mask ventilation , 10 minute birth 3 . Acidosis within 60 minute birth ( define occurrence umbilical cord arterial venous pH &lt; 7.00 otherwise arterial capillary pH &lt; 7.00 ) 4 . Base Deficit ( 16 mmol/L ) umbilical cord blood sample ( arterial , venous capillary ) within 60 minute birth Infants meet criterion A assess whether meet neurological abnormality entry criterion ( B ) train personnel : B . Clinical Evidence Moderate severe encephalopathy , consist altered state consciousness ( lethargy , stupor coma ) AND least one following : 1. hypotonia 2. abnormal reflex include oculomotor pupillary abnormality 3. absent weak suck 4. clinical seizure Infants meet criterion A &amp; B assess aEEG unit facility Cerebral Function Monitoring ( CFM ) available . C. ( Optional ) At least 30 minute duration amplitude integrated EEG recording show abnormal background aEEG activity seizures . There must one following : 1. normal background seizure activity 2. continuous seizure activity 3. moderately abnormal activity : Only Lower border 5 mV . upper border remain 10mV 4 . Severely Abnormal activity ( suppressed activity ) : Both Lower border 5 mV upper border 10mV Infants expect &gt; 6 hour age time randomization.Every effort make ensure entry study 3 hour age . Major congenital abnormality , diaphragmatic hernia require ventilation , congenital abnormality suggestive chromosomal anomaly syndrome include brain dysgenesis .</criteria>
