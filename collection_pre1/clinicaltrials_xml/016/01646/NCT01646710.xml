	<detailed_description>Aims Objectives The study aim explore way Optifood develop create relevant food-based recommendation ( FBRs ) use advocacy purpose . Specific objective seek : 1 . To develop tool formulate/test FBRs create effective advocacy material . 2 . To assess performance hand government/NGOs , Peru , Thailand India identify structural change require provide guidance incorporation program planning advocacy activity . 3 . To use tool develop locally appropriate FBRs Peru , Thailand India . Study Setting The study take place Switzerland , India , Thailand Peru . Collaborating partner specific location follow : - World Health Organisation - Geneva - Society Applied Studies - New Delhi - Mahidol University - Bangkok - Instituto de Investigaci√≥n Nutricional - Peru . FBRs test India Kheri Kalan PHC Haryana State . Overall study design The study aim pilot test Optifood tool relevant organisation , use tool test refine exist FBRs target population . Mixed-methods research recommend explore complex intervention . Accordingly , quantitative qualitative method use address study objective . The study use wide range respondent gain broad understand current behaviour , identify key influencers understand facilitator barrier behaviour change different perspective . Sample size determine saturation sampling , , continue investigate new information uncover . Design Key staff relevant nutrition expert governmental non-governmental organisation train use Optifood , ask provide feedback may adapt support nutrition programme plan activity . Next , Optifood use evaluate refine current FBRs target population , test mother child age 9-11 month study area . This age group select since 9-11 month old infant likely demonstrate great nutritional benefit compare old child , establish CF intake younger age group ( e.g . 6-8 month ) likely transition eat complementary food . Sampling strategy Organisational staff purposefully select relevant NGOs research institute Peru , Thailand India . Relevant global nutrition expert also purposefully sample initial pilot test Geneva . Sampling purposive research team aim inclusiveness , representativeness . The characteristic participant FGD reflect diversity breadth potential Optifood user . Organisations select base whether involved nutrition program would use Optifood . Mothers child age 9-11 month ( n=60 ) recruit six catchment area within study set collect information food pattern , need run Optifood . Mothers child age 9-11 month ( n=36 ) also randomly select six subcentres Kheri Kalan PHC ( i.e . 6 randomly select mother subcentre ) test FBRs finalise use Optifood . This number base recommended sample size Trials Improved Practices ( TIPs ) protocol guidance , factor attrition rate 10 % base observe similar TIPs study Indonesia . Health worker ( n=3-6 per FGD ) purposefully select study area express impression new FBRs FGDs . Sampling purposive research team aim inclusiveness , representativeness . The number FGDs depend number require reach data saturation i.e. , repeat new material theme emerge . Characteristics Health worker FGDs reflect diversity breadth potential Health worker involve promotion nutrition message . Data Analysis Quantitative data analysis Quantitative data collection method study include QQs , FFQs , 24-HRs . All quantitative data double-entered data entry error identify use range consistency check . After data clean , transfer Stata 11 software analysis . Dietary data analyse specific diet program develop use Microsoft Excel . Categories generate continuous variable need . Data analyse represent use numerical , graphical tabular method . In order estimate change infant diet FBRs test mother , pair t-tests use identify difference mean 95 % CIs 24-HRs . Differences consider significant P &lt; 0.05 . Statistics use descriptive purpose , i.e . study population represent proportion , mean , etc . dietary data represent mean standard deviation . Qualitative data analysis The study rely heavily FGDs , IDIs structure observation various stage insight refine Optifood tool . Qualitative analysis iterative , thus evolve alongside data collection . NVivo 8 software use store code FGD IDI transcript translate English . Contents FGD IDI transcript identify range health personnel mother ' reaction Optifood FBRs , respectively . A thematic approach use code FDGs IDIs , start initial free cod ultimate aim categorize theme category . This process use ground theory approach , cod entirely inductive.8 However , qualitative data cod allow emergence new unanticipated theme . Triangulation data important establish reliability data . Accordingly , data FGDs IDIs compare checked inconsistency completeness . Doing help student ascertain `` correct '' interpretation data . All conclusion present key study staff accuracy improve reliability . Methods Objective 1- Developing Optifood tool Global nutrition expert train use Optifood tool Geneva . Two FGDs conduct 1-day post-training ass performance potential application Optifood . A self-administered QQ collect obtain information computer literacy , professional experience socio-demographics . Will take place trained facilitator fluency local language ( ) transcriber . Nutrition expert answer question recommend change , well feasibility acceptability Optifood . Open-ended question ask , follow specific prompt relate research question . FGDs record digital recorder . Health personnel answer self-administered QQs computer literacy , professional experience sociodemographic information . Objective 2- Adapting Optifood local use Key staff NGOs and/or research institute Lima , Bangkok New Delhi train use Optifood tool . For organisation , two FGDs conduct 7-days post-training ass performance potential application Optifood . A self-administered QQ collect obtain information computer literacy , professional experience socio-demographics . FGDs take place trained facilitator fluency local language ( ) transcriber . Health personnel answer question recommend change , well feasibility acceptability Optifood . Open-ended question ask , follow specific prompt relate research question . FGDs record digital recorder . QQs translate local language need . Health personnel answer self-administered QQs computer literacy , professional experience sociodemographic information . Objective 3 - Using Optifood develop , test refine FBRs Developing FBRs Optifood use develop population-specific FBRs target population . In order run model , Optifood require data follow parameter : 1 . List food eat target population 2 . Average portion size 3 . How many times/week food could consume 4 . Whether food staple food ( Yes/No ) 5 . Whether food snack ( Yes/No ) 6 . Cost per 100 gram edible portion food 7 . Information food pattern food group ( e.g . legume , fruit , vegetable , milk , etc . ) measure number servings/week . . This information also include low level ( 5th percentile ) , upper level ( 95th percentile ) average ( 50th percentile ) 8 . Food Composition Table 9 . Average body weight population - estimate . Most data available collaborate partner . However , data cost food food frequency need collect order run Optifood . A food sub-group frequency questionnaire use collect dietary data weekly frequency consumption food sub-group usually consume child age 9-11 month . The food group sub-groups include FFQ finalise India base food report dietary survey data SAS . This FFQ base FFQ use National Nutrition Survey Colombia . Data collect 30 mother infant age 9-11 month . For food sub-group , train research assistant fluent local language ( ) ask mother food food sub-group ( i.e . cooked vegetable , salad raw vegetable ) consume child . If answer yes , mother ask estimate number time child consume food sub-group past week . A market survey also do obtain cost food consume per 100g edible portion . Research assistant go 3 local market 3 food seller study set collect one sample frequently consume food regardless whether cooked raw . The edible portion determine gram food purchase . For cooked food , raw ingredient purchase cook provide cost per 100g edible portion . This method base one use similar study Indonesia . Once data collect , Optifood use generate FBRs target population study set . Testing FBRs mother An interviewer-administered socio-demographic QQ collect obtain descriptive data participant test FBRs . QQs translate local language need . Upon development , FBRs test 36 mother infant age 9-11 month . Evaluation methodology base ProPAN strategy , one modification use Trial Improved Practices ( TIPs ) method test multiple instead individual FBRs mother . Sample size base TIPS guidance similar study Indonesia . Research assistants introduce FBRs mother respective home . IDIs do ass impression FBRs feasibility adopt . Mothers give 7 day implement FBRs . IDIs do beginning , middle end 7-day testing period ( Day 8 ) reinforce message assess feasibility long-term practice . IDIs take place train interviewer fluency local language ( ) . Mothers answer question feasibility acceptability FBRs , barrier use potential way change put FBRs practice . IDIs final visit end 7-day testing period record digital recorder . Based IDI result , FBRs refine use population . The child 's dietary intake also assess use modification interactive multiple-pass 24-hour recall7 pre- post-FBR introduction . Trained research assistant fluency local language ( ) ask mother recall food beverage consume child past 24 hour , estimate amount food consume . The modification make original interactive multiple-pass 24 hour recall end interview , mother also ask estimate frequency consumption food past week . Infant weight also measure end 7-day testing period . Health worker also provide additional data barrier nutrition counseling , well feasibility acceptability promote Optifood-generated FBRs comparison currently use . Health worker participate FGD collect data FBRs . A trained facilitator fluency local language ( ) transcriber ask health worker open-ended question impression FBRs , feasibility promoting , barrier nutrition counsel target area . FGDs record digital recorder . A brief socio-demographic QQ also administer health worker collect descriptive data .</detailed_description>
