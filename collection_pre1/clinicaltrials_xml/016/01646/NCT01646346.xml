	<brief_title>4D Image-Guided Partial Breast Radiation Stage 0 l Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study enrol 30 patient evaluate feasibility use 4D CT daily image guidance Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation ( APBI ) decrease set-up error individualize plan target volume limit non-target breast tissue dose . The two specific breast constraint shall decrease V50 ( percent volume breast receive 50 % prescribe dose ) V100 ( percent volume breast receive 100 % prescribe dose ) . The goal decrease 45 % 23.5 % respectively , 33 % NSABP B39 standard 60 % 35 % .</detailed_description>

Gross disease must unifocal pathologic ( invasive and/or DCIS ) tumor size 2 cm less . ( Patients microscopic multifocality eligible long total pathologic tumor size 2 cm less . ) Patients invasive breast cancer require axillary stag include sentinel node biopsy alone ( negative ) , sentinel node biopsy follow axillary dissection sample minimum total 6 axillary node axillary dissection alone ( minimum 6 axillary node ) . Axillary stag NOT required patient DCIS . The patient must simulation within 8 weeks/56 day final surgery breast cancer ( lumpectomy , reexcision margin , axillary staging procedure ) . Patients history nonipsilateral breast malignancy eligible diseasefree 2 year prior enrollment . Patients follow cancer eligible even diagnose treat within past 2 year : carcinoma situ cervix , colon , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Chemotherapy permit plan â‰¥ 2 week radiation . Urine pregnancy test must perform negative woman young 60 tubal ligation , oophorectomy , hysterectomy . Separate incision lumpectomy sentinel node biopsy present . Use one incision typically result contiguous cavity tumor bed sentinel node sampling , inability radiation oncologist delineate tumor bed sentinel node bed .
