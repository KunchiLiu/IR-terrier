	<brief_summary>Background : - Individuals vary tolerance receive ambiguous information . However , much know ambiguous genetic test information receive . Also , much know at-risk individual internalize process result . More information need information affect person life . - Lynch Syndrome genetic condition carry high risk colon cancer cancer . Individuals risk Lynch Syndrome genetic testing . The test may confirm diagnosis determine action take . Results genetic testing also affect perspective relative might also affect . However , genetic testing also produce variant unknown significance ( VUS ) . VUS data may provide enough information make decision . Researchers want study people receive VUS result genetic test Lynch Syndrome . Objectives : - To learn impact experience receive VUS Lynch Syndrome genetic testing . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age recently VUS result genetic test Lynch Syndrome . Design : - Participants ask answer demographic question . They also 45- 60-minute phone interview . - During phone interview , participant ask series question diagnosis . They ask receive result felt right receiving . They also discuss spoken result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In field cancer genetics , clinician patient encounter challenge relate significance unclassified genetic variant ( UV ) variant unknown significance ( VUS ) . As field medical genetics move toward whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) , challenge inevitably become frequent . VUS represent ambiguous uncertain data , pathogenicity demonstrate excluded publish literature , mutation database basis clinical finding . Such variant present clinical interpretation challenge also evoke new counsel dilemma understand psychosocial impact uncertain genetic test result . This exploratory study aim seek insight psychological impact receive VUS semi-structured interview 30 40 individual receive VUS test result one Lynch Syndrome/Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ( HNPCC ) mismatch repair gene . The interviews focus experience receive result cognitive , affective behavioral effect related uncertainty result . Interviews transcribe subject thematic analysis identify theme run interview . Understanding impact receive VUS may identify area future intervention study minimize negative effect event . Additionally , data may contribute formulation guideline surround consent disclosure VUS diseases ultimately WGS .</detailed_description>
