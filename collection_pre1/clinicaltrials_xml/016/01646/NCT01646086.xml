	<brief_summary>To achieve long term goal strengthen behavioral weight loss program , purpose project test enhance , daily weight track instruction current standard care ( weekly weight track ) alternative mode care ( weight track ) . The investigator postulate daily weight track boost ongoing awareness engagement dietary intake physical activity monitoring , thus improve weight loss outcome . The central hypothesis study daily weight track improve weight loss process outcomes relative less frequent weight tracking , without adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weight Tracking Weight Loss Outcomes : Establishing Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given pernicious reach obesity evidence current behavioral treatment modestly effective change weight , effort refine behavioral recommendation order improve weight loss intervention crucial . Frequency track body weight present prime target behavioral enhancement weight loss . Daily self-monitoring ( e.g. , dietary intake physical activity ) already well-established central component behavioral weight loss process . However , current standard care behavioral weight loss regard weigh weekly tracking weight , program caution weight tracking . It suggest frequent weight tracking may negative impact mental health outcome weight loss , minimal data address concern experimentally context active weight loss program . Observational evidence behavioral weight control trial community study suggest great frequency track weight associate well weight outcome . Stronger experimental evidence need establish causal link weight track weight outcome elucidate impact mental health weight loss . To achieve long-term goal strengthen behavioral weight loss program , purpose project test enhance , daily weight track instruction current standard care ( weekly weight track ) alternate model care limit data ( weight track ) . In pursuit study goal , 336 overweight obese adult recruit randomize one three 12-month weight loss intervention 12-month follow-up ( 24 month total time study ) : standard care ( weekly weight track weight loss ) , enhance condition ( daily weight track weight loss ) , comparison condition ( weight track weight loss ) . The rationale behind proposal within context social ecology social-cognitive framework behavior change , enhancement key environmental feature ( i.e. , weight track environment ) weight loss contribute success promote self-efficacy critical behavior . Specific aim study seek determine effect weight track frequency weight loss process outcome , well elucidate effect weight track frequency mental health weight loss . This study expect outcome enhance standard care weight loss , lead good weight control overweight obese adult thus directly mitigate public health impact obesity crisis .</detailed_description>
