	<detailed_description>To improve physical fitness , combine exercise program include progressive resistance training , balance training , functional training use sample institutionalized elderly people . The exercise program frequency 2 time week duration 16 week . The intensity moderate , measure 0-10 scale . The level intensity specify follow : 10- point scale , movement 0 maximal effort muscle group 10 , moderate-intensity effort 5 6 , high- intensity effort 7 8 . There currently insufficient evidence combine exercise program , develop improve physical fitness , improve ADL performance care dependency also .</detailed_description>
