	<brief_summary>After failure initial ADT , addition anti-androgen establish treat castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Substitution first anti-androgen anti-androgen withdrawal result treatment responses 25-40 % patient 4-6 month . A effective second line treatment failure first ADT could prolong time state symptomatic HRPC , currently treat docetaxel accompany significant side effect . Since importance IGF-signaling PC indicate preclinical result also clinical efficacy somatostatin analog , clinical research new somatostatin analog pasireotide warrant . This study design define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pasireotide LAR patient castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . It also aim preliminary efficacy evaluation pasireotide within dose expansion part MTD . Preliminary efficacy assessed evaluation different measure prostate cancer e.g . change PSA , disease control rate ( RECIST 1.1 ) , symptom change biomarkers link mode action pasireotide LAR . The study also explore characteristic patient might benefit treatment approach .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . ECOG 0 2 2 . Histologically proven adenocarcinoma prostate . 3 . Patients CRPC ( castration resistant prostate cancer ) : advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate . 4 . Prior treatment GnRHagonist GnRHantagonist least 6 month . The medication must change least 3 month prior start study treatment . 5 . Prior treatment antiandrogen ( e.g . bicalutamide , flutamide , cyproteronacetate ) allow necessary . Patients treat antiandrogen must discontinue antiandrogen least 6 week prior start study treatment . 1 . Dose escalation part : prior treatment antiandrogen GnRH agonist antagonist allow . 2 . Dose expansion part : prior concomitant treatment antiandrogen GnRH agonist GnRH antagonist ≤6 week allow ( order control flare ) . 6 . Serum testosterone within castration level ( &lt; 50 ng/dl &lt; 1,7 nM ) 7 . Disease progression demonstrate rise PSA without metastasis . PSA ≥2 ng/mL study entry . Rising PSA define two consecutive rise nadir value ; individual measurement obtain least 1 week apart . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Dose expansion part : Secondary hormonal manipulation prostate cancer ( GnRH agonist antagonist ) 6 week , include concomitant antiandrogens . 2 . Prior cytotoxic therapy e.g . docetaxel , mitoxantrone . 3 . Patients receive radiotherapy target lesion . Patients receive local radiotherapy nontarget lesion local symptom control within last 4 week must recover adverse effect radiotherapy record baseline symptom . Lesions treat locoregional therapy within last 3 month study inclusion qualify target lesion . Additional protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion apply .</criteria>
