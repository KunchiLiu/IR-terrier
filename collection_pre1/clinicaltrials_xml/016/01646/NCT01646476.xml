	<brief_summary>Malignant gastric outlet obstruction result gastric adenocarcinoma , lead intractable vomiting , nausea , poor oral food intake . Although self-expandable metallic stent ( SEMS ) insertion excellent technical clinical success rate relieve gastric outlet obstruction symptom , uncovered SEMS susceptible re-stenosis tumor ingrowth opening stent wire filament . Therefore , common reason stent failure uncover stent tumor ingrowth . The covered SEMS membrane prevents ingrowth mesh wall consequently show low rate re-stenosis uncovered SEMS . However , cover SEMS high risk stent migration compare uncovered SEMS . Recent prospective , randomize study show significant difference uncover covered SEMS term stent patency rate well technical clinical success rate . Recently investigator develop new cover SEMS gastric outlet obstruction . This new covered SEMS feature may contribute reduce migration rate : 1 ) partially covered design ; 2 ) less radial force central portion stent ; 3 ) presence lasso enable position stent adjust deployment ; 4 ) presence protrusion side stent . This prospective , randomized study aim compare effectiveness side effect newly develop cover SEMS uncovered SEMS patient malignant gastric outlet obstruction gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
