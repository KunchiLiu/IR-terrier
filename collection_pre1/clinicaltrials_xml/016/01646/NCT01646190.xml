	<detailed_description>BACKROUND : The multimodal concept fast-track ( FT ) surgery develop Kehlet et al . 1990s reduce perioperative surgical stress colorectal surgery , result low morbidity &amp; mortality enhanced recovery . The main evidence-based FT component include : pain control optimization epidural systemic analgesia , short-acting anesthetic , opioids-sparing analgesia , minimally invasive surgery , preoperative carbohydrate administration , normothermia preservation , individualized i.v goal-directed fluid therapy , bowel preparation , routine use drain , nasogastric tube , urinary catheter , early oral nutrition active ambulation , well dedicate preoperative counseling define FT clinical pathway discharge criterion . Many cohort study , randomize controlled trial , meta-analyses systematic review demonstrate safety efficacy decrease morbidity , hospital stay , improve patient satisfaction compare standard care ( SC ) . Only scarce information , mainly base RetroPro control clinical trial ( CCTs ) , available fast-track perioperative care senior patient ( &gt; 70 year ) already represent 15-18 % western population , 40 % colorectal surgery perform Geneva University Hospital ( HUG ) . The aim randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare short-term clinical outcome specifically senior design fast-track perioperative program versus standard care ( SC ) elective colorectal surgery senior patient . OBJECTIVES : 30-day postoperative morbidity accord Dindo-Clavien classification complication primary clinical endpoint . Length hospital stay ( LOS ) include readmission , autonomy preservation ( activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) scale ) quality life evaluation secondary endpoint . METHOD : All patient 70 year require elective colorectal surgery include study give write informed consent . Exclusion criterion consist emergency revisional liver-associated surgery , inability discern/speak French English . Patients 1:1 randomize ( institutional table randomization .</detailed_description>
