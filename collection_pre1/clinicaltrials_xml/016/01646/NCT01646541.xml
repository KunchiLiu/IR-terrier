	<brief_summary>Most patient mitral valve disease symptomatic shortness breath limited activity level prior mitral valve surgery . Despite surgical repair replacement mitral valve , many patient remain symptomatic impaired ability live active lifestyle . Often extensive evaluation , pulmonary , leave ventricular dysfunction , valvular heart disease responsible continue symptom , patient limit persistent pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) rest exertion responsible limiting activity level impact quality life . It goal propose study systematically characterize symptomatic asymptomatic patient great six month mitral valve surgery use clinical data , echocardiographic evaluation , laboratory assessment , patient , invasive hemodynamic measurement . The investigator screen asymptomatic symptomatic patient rest echocardiography also echocardiography exercise , many patient exhibit exercise-induced PH follow mitral valve surgery . Pulmonary artery ( PA ) pressure estimate echocardiography use Doppler-derived calculation . If elevate PA pressure observe echocardiography , symptomatic patient undergo right heart catheterization invasive pressure measurement , gold-standard diagnosis PH . When PH present normal wedge pressure ( PCWP ) invasive pressure measurement , assessment identify potential candidate PH therapy perform . This involve patient breathe inhale nitric oxide , rapid-acting , pulmonary vasodilator short half-life . While breathe inhaled nitric oxide , blood pressure , PA pressure , PCWP , cardiac output monitor characterize individual could benefit symptomatically pharmacotherapy treat underlie PH . It important note small minority patient exhibit positive vasodilator response PH normal PCWP without initial vasodilator response would still identify candidate chronic PH therapy . The information generate propose research make significant contribution understand PH group patient previously study . Scientific report evaluation patient PH mitral valve surgery almost nonexistent modern era . Furthermore , patient PH due mitral valve disease exclude clinical trial agent currently approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat PH . Therefore , work carefully characterize PA pressure objective manner group patient follow mitral valve surgery remain limited respect activity level . In addition , investigator gain good understanding frequency patient PH normal PCWP , identifies cohort patient could improvement symptom quality life chronic vasodilator treatment .</brief_summary>
