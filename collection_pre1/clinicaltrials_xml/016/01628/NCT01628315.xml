	<brief_summary>- To examine short- long-term value appearance new active lesion predict extent cortical subcortical deep gray matter ( SDGM ) atrophy 5 year ASA ( Avonex- Steroid-Azathioprine ) study . - To explore accumulation cortical SDGM atrophy 5 year differs respect number new active lesion amount disease activity , early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) patient develop sustain disability progression . - To examine relationship development cortical SDGM atrophy regional likelihood development new active lesion 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Lesion Activity Analysis Avonex- Steroid Azathioprine ( ASA ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , MS classify disease predominantly affect white matter ( WM ) central nervous system . However , pathological change gray matter ( GM ) increasingly recognize important component MS disease process . Advances MRI enable detection change GM morphology . The ASA study placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy AvonexÂ® alone combination azathioprine ( AZA ) AZA corticosteroids initial MS therapy 181 patient early RRMS 5 year . The study conduct Czech Republic , clinical MRI examination conclude 5 year . No study evaluate evolution cortical SDGM atrophy relation global regional accumulation active lesion and/or occurrence relapse predictive short- long-term perspective . The ASA study provide unique opportunity prospectively study impact cortical SDGM atrophy accumulation long-term disability progression define cohort early RRMS patient present various amount disease activity , measure appearance new active lesion occurrence relapse . By assess lesion activity 0-6 6-12 month ASA study able evaluate predictive value development cortical SDGM atrophy early RRMS patient 5 year respect number new active lesion amount disease activity first year . We also evaluate lesion development 12-60 month relation development cortical SDGM atrophy . We also analyze accumulation cortical SDGM atrophy early RRMS patient develop sustain disability progression , base number new active lesion amount clinical MRI disease activity short- long-term . Regional classification new active lesion 5 year cortical , subcortical fossa posterior allow prospective examination cortical SDGM atrophy appearance new lesion .</detailed_description>
