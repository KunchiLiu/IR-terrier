In past year , several study examine effect intervention program lifestyle behavior change risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CAD ) . The result study quite equivocal . Some demonstrate positive effect intervention program decrease CAD risk factor obesity rate , others find clear effect . The conflicting result could due methodological issue different study ' design . For example , study report amount intensity physical activity program use intervention program . Furthermore , intervention program include nutritional manipulation . In recent review paper , find efficient program combine group workshop , guide physical activity program individualize counsel session employer high risk develop CAD . Intervention program include mainly guided physical activity find less effective . It note optimal program format implement workplace completely clear . Study purpose : To examine effect health promotion intervention program workplace risk factor cardiovascular metabolic disease , well-being , life-style behavior absenteeism workplace . Subjects : The study approve local ethic committee . All participant sign inform consent form . Study 's participant include adult male female ( old 18yrs ) . The 1500 participant recruit 10 different worksites across Israel . Study protocol : The length intervention program workplace 6 month . Parameters take two occasion : 1 .

Circumference measure two site subject stand still foot close together . Waist circumference measure height bell-button ; hip circumference measure wide point pelvis . Waist-hip ratio calculate compare common updated norm . Blood pressure rest pulse measure twice subject sit position . The average value calculate . Blood test : Each participant study ask perform follow test prior begin intervention program . The parameter include : blood glucose , hemoglobin , LDL , HDL , cholesterol , triglyceride , liver function ( GGT , ALT ) , Hemoglobin A1C . Absenteeism work ( due illness ) : With assistance human resource department , end 6 month intervention program number day sick leave record participant study . If applicable , data compare last year absenteeism . Intervention program characteristic : Structured guide physical activity program certify trainer , General Guidelines perform physical activity outside work hour , Counseling guideline kitchen staff ( organization food service ) , Supplying general guideline healthy diet nutrition , Modifying work environment health promote one ( use poster , electronic communication , daily weekly tip etc… ) , Lectures general topic - physical activity , nutrition , ergonomics , behavior change , sleep behavior .

During first two week intensity remain relatively moderate ( rate perceive exertion 3-4 ) , third week program intensity increase 5-6 fifth week , intensity increase 6 8 . The resistance training include exercise major muscle group 15-20 min . The resistance exercise perform dumbbell , resistance band body weight . Additionally , participant program ask perform additional aerobic workouts 20-30min ( rate perceive exertion 5-6 ) week , least two workout . General guideline physical activity : All participant study receive pedometer personal use . All employee receive recommended amount physical activity perform throughout week . The information distribute information sheet , poster e-mail . The recommendation include different type exercise perform order improve aerobic fitness recommend dos : amount daily step , amount weekly step .

Statistical analysis : Paired t-test use examine intervention program effect anthropometric measure , blood test parameter absenteeism . The effect intervention program also examine use multiple regression analysis . Significant level set P &lt; 0.05 . SPSS software use statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
