	<brief_summary>This phase IV study open , prospective , single-center , single-surgeon bilateral eye study investigate bilateral uncorrected intermediate visual acuity presbyopic hyperopic patient , treat Presbyopia Algorithm SUPRACOR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Investigation SUPRACOR Visual Outcomes Presbyopic Hyperopic Patients With Without Astigmatism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The developed software algorithm SUPRACOR use subjective refraction eye create treatment distance vision correction . This part treatment show difference regular LASIK treatment hyperopic case . In addition treatment distance vision additional central ablation component add address near vision . Excimer Laser Technolas® 217z100P , High Speed Session Management Software ( KERACOR V5.0 ) ZYOPTIX Cards well diagnostic device use # 1162 study CE certify used standard purpose . This study conduct Mater Private Hospital ( Eye Laser Department ) Professor Michael O'Keefe would recruit 40 subject accord inclusion/exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>

Manifest Refraction eye : Sphere : +0.75 D +5.00 D Cylinder : 2.0 D 0.0 D Spherical Equivalent : +0.75 D +4.0 D 6 . Subjects must presbyopia determine agerelated need optical aid ( ≥+1.50 D ) read best distance correction 7 . The proper SUPRACOR treatment patient must target dominant eye distance 0.0/ 0.25 dpt follow eye near 0.5/0.75 . The delta target must remain 0.5 dpt 8 . Subjects screen successfully acceptance SUPRACOR simulation 9 . Subjects contact lens wearer must gas permeable ( GP ) lenses discontinue least 3 week soft lens discontinue least 1 week prior preoperative evaluation eye treat . Contact lens wearer wear contact lens amount time preoperative baseline examination operative visit must treat . 10 . Corneal topography normal . 11 . Subjects contact lens wearer must 2 central keratometry reading 2 manifest subjective refraction take preoperatively least one week apart . The refraction value must differ 0.50 D define manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) . The keratometry value must differ previous value 0.50D either meridian . 12 . High contrast , manifest , best spectaclecorrected decimal distance visual acuity ( VA ) measure phoropter must correctable least 1.0 ( Snellen20/20 6/6 ) eye . 13 . Mesopic pupil size measure Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer special PupiloMeter function must 3.5mm 6.5 mm 1 . Subjects combination baseline corneal thickness plan operative parameter LASIK procedure would result less 250 micron remain posterior corneal thickness flap postoperatively . 2 . Subject flap thickness 100120µm plan 3 . Eyes baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibit difference great 0.75D sphere power , difference great 0.50D cylinder power , difference cylinder axis 15 degree compare baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction . For manifest cylinder less 0.75D , difference cylinder axis take consideration . 4 . Subjects preoperative assessment ocular topography indicate one eye suitable candidate treatment base upon suggest computersimulated treatment plan . 5 . Any subject go comanaged ophthalmologist optometrist approve Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH Excimer laser Investigator . 6 .
