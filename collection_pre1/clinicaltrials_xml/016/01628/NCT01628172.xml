	<brief_summary>Despite development numerous drug therapy design treat hypertension , remain considerable poorly manage health , social economic burden . For various reason , include significant health care cost treatment , estimate 65 % hypertensive patient untreated and/or uncontrolled blood pressure ( BP ) . Aside impact renal function , chronic hypertension significantly increase risk stroke , coronary artery disease , heart failure , vascular disease . It believe involved progression cardiac arrhythmia . This link hypertension cardiovascular health well describe ; combine effect age obesity-battling Western world . The recently publish result Symplicity HTN-2 trial ( Renal sympathetic denervation patient treatment resistant hypertension ) establish therapeutic benefit catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation hypertension , enormous potential management large challenge patient population . The propose , multicenter trial attempt confirm expand promise data conduct double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial . Patients may qualify participate research study doctor determine drug-resistant , chronic hypertension . Overall participation research study 13 month include 1 month start study procedure 12 month follow-up study procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients qualify study provide consent undergo renal angiogram order assess suitability catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation . A renal angiogram x-ray study blood vessel kidney evaluate blockage , abnormality could affect blood supply kidney . It perform inject contrast dye catheter ( tiny tube ) blood vessel kidney . The study doctor ass whether renal artery suitable receive catheter-based renal denervation . Both group receive sedation anesthesia prior begin procedure . The first group undergo catheter-based sympathetic renal denervation . Renal Sympathetic Denervation procedure use catheter probe insert renal ( kidney ) artery deactivate nerve link high blood pressure . The second group receive renal angiography without delivery ablative energy .</detailed_description>
