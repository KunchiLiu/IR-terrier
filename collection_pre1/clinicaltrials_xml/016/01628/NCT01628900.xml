	<brief_summary>The prevalence acute pyelonephritis ( PNA ) 60-75 000/year . They traditionally classify uncomplicated ( 60-65 % ) complicate . If assume uncomplicated PNA treat outpatient cure rate 80 % , second group heterogeneous . Some patient severely infected . But others , despite old age , structural urologic abnormality control history , risk factor simply manage . The investigator propose reclassify PNA 3 category : uncomplicated PNA ( PNA-1 ) , PNA moderate severity ( PNA-2 ) , major PNA ( PNA-3 ) test whether PNA-2 benefit outpatient care PNA-1 . The existence biological marker severity bacterial infection would support tailored approach . The pro-adrenomedullin ( pro-ADM ) , successfully test identify severe community acquire pneumonia , interesting candidate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Europe North America , urinary tract infection ( UTI ) 2nd large community-acquired infection . In U.S. , number annual doctor 's consultation UTI estimate 8 million woman 's APN 250,000 . In Britain , estimate number 62 1000 woman consult UTI annually . Extrapolated France , figure would 5-6 million annual consultation 60 75 000 APN . APN infection associate urinary pelvic / renal parenchyma , mark fever ≥ 38.5 ° C , spontaneous pain flank , pain cause cost vertebral angle positive urine dipstick ( BU ) . Conversely , pain fever reduce 30 % PNA cystitis , history PNA evocative . Without precise technology detect possible renal micro-abscesses , scar APN , direct evidence upper tract infection rarely make . Positive blood culture ( 30-50 % case ) indirect evidence . In case , infection urine affirm cyto-bacteriological examination ( urinalysis ) , result available 48-72 hour culture . It assume urine culture positive leukocyte 's count ≥ 104 cell per milliliter ( GB / ml ) bacteriuria ≥ 105 colony form unit ( CFU ) / ml urine ( maximum two ) uropathogen germ . Therefore , diagnosis treatment PNA probabilistic beginning , hence interest BU . It consider positive leukocyte count ≥ 10 ± GB/mm3 ± nitriturie . Done correctly , positive predictive value ( PPV ) 74 % NPV 98 % . Classically two type PNA , complicate PNA non-complicated PNA , oppose age , sex , severity , causative organism sensitivity antibiotic . Uncomplicated PNA best define . It occur normal urinary tract nonpregnant woman , age 15 65 , systemic disease urological surgery . It accompany septic shock renal abscess . It due E. Coli 90 % case , sometimes Klebsiella Proteus sp , susceptible recommend antibiotic . Its overall cure rate , define bacterial eradication disappearance sign symptom , observe three visit 6 week follow-up , ≥ 80 % treat home hospital . Other PNA , traditionally describe complicate , well define . It include PNA septic shock , abscess renal failure , PNA old woman men . It also rank PNA occur urinary tract malformation , whether impact renal function ( bifid pelvis ureter , renal cyst ) . In case , evolution assume less simple PNA young woman without unavoidably complicate . But tool measure impact chronic condition PNA degree infection severe . A good understanding evolutionary potential various category PNA would adapt therapeutic management . Different parameter would help approach include duration antibiotic therapy , place care ( home hospital ) case , optimal duration hospitalization . It recognize uncomplicated PNA young woman treat immediately home single oral antibiotic 7 day . For category PNA , generally recommend hospitalization evaluate effect antibiotic therapy , less two week . The benefit therapeutic approach unknown . Instead traditional terminology `` complicate '' `` uncomplicated '' investigator propose new classification three category : - non-severe mild PNA , correspond uncomplicated PNA ( PNA-1 ) - PNA moderate severity , include less intense infectious syndrome occur chronic , stable controlled disease , - PNA severe sepsis , septic shock hemodynamic instability / immediately complicate fact presence alter / progressive chronic disease risk decompensate ( PNA-3 ) . In prospective observational study 34 French emergency service , 211 patient meet PNA criterion include two week . They divide 62.5 % PNA-1 , 24.6 % PNA-2 12.7 % PNA-3 . This classification reflect initial severity infection subsequent evolutionary potential , distinguish class 2 . This differ two lack severity infection share class 1 existence factor age male , stable disease abnormality structural urological without systemic impact . The evolutionary potential risk associate factor , independent ITU , never measure . The question whether patient PNA-2 treat benign PNA PNA risk complication . The Infectious Diseases Society America offer two treatment possibility patient , whose effectiveness never compare : 1 . Treatment home oral monotherapy , preferably fluoroquinolone ( FQ ) 7 day , PNA-1 , 2 . Or start parenteral antibiotic follow 12 24 hour observation short-term hospitalization unit ( UHCD ) deciding : return home prolong hospitalization . Our hypothesis prognosis ANP mainly relate severity initial infection secondarily history related condition controllable little decompensated . In fact , table mild infection NAP-1 NAP-2 , differ demographic factor ( age , sex ) history little influence evolution . These two category PNA logically receive support . To support hypothesis , investigator propose control intervention trial PNA-2 randomize two treatment strategy , one correspond management PNA-1 , demonstrate prognostic similarity . In addition priori classification , clinical data study use construct prognostic score . To end , investigator intend measure pro-adrenomedullin ( pro-ADM ) patient . Adrenomedullin , powerful natural vasodilator , also immunomodulatory bactericidal property explain increase OF ADM serum level severe systemic infection . However , dosage difficult short half-life blood . One degradation product , pro-ADM , reflect active ADM , stable easily measurable . The dosage pro-ADM recently allow reliable assessment individual prognosis septic patient , particularly context community-acquired pneumonia , lead cause death infection . Although pro-ADM mainly use predict prognosis death rare complication PNA community , investigator test ability distinguish hospitalize PNA patient outpatient . pro-ADM test improve performance prognostic score .</detailed_description>
