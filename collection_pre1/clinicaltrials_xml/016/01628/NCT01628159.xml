	<criteria>Clinical 1 . Male nonpregnant female ≥18 year age ; 2 . Rutherford Clinical Category 24 ; 3 . Patient willing provide inform consent , geographically stable comply require follow visit , test schedule medication regimen ; Angiographic Lesion 4 . Length ≤15 cm ; 5 . Up two focal lesion segment within designate 15 cm length vessel may treat ( e.g . two discrete segment , separate several cm , fall within composite length &lt; 15 cm ) ; 6 . ≥70 % stenosis visual estimate ; 7 . Lesion location start ≥1 cm common femoral bifurcation terminates distally ≤2 cm tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm origin TP trunk ; 8. de novo lesion ( ) nonstented restenotic lesion ( ) &gt; 90 day prior angioplasty procedure ; 9 . Lesion locate least 3 cm stent , target vessel previously stented ; 10 . Target vessel diameter ≥4 ≤6 mm able treat available device size matrix ; 11 . Successful , uncomplicated ( without use cross device ) antegrade wire cross lesion ; 12 . A patent inflow artery free significant lesion ( ≥50 % stenosis ) confirm angiography ( treatment target lesion acceptable successful treatment inflow artery lesion ) ; NOTE : Successful inflow artery treatment define attainment residual diameter stenosis ≤30 % without death major vascular complication . 13 . At least one patent native outflow artery ankle , free significant ( ≥50 % ) stenosis confirm angiography previously revascularized ( treatment outflow disease NOT permit index procedure ) ; 14 . Contralateral limb lesion ( ) treat within 2 week and/or plan 30 day protocol treatment order avoid confound complication ; 15 . No prior vascular intervention within 2 week and/or plan 30 day protocol treatment . Patients exclude ANY follow condition apply : 1 . Pregnant plan become pregnant men intend father child ; 2 . Life expectancy &lt; 5 year ; 3 . Patient currently participate investigational drug device study previously enrol study ; NOTE : Enrollment another clinical trial follow period allow . 4 . History hemorrhagic stroke within 3 month ; 5 . Previous plan surgical interventional procedure within 2 week within 30 day index procedure ; 6 . History MI , thrombolysis angina within 2 week enrollment ; 7 . Rutherford Class 0 , 1 , 5 6 ; 8 . Renal failure chronic kidney disease MDRD GFR ≤30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 ( serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/L within 30 day index procedure treat dialysis ) ; 9 . Prior vascular surgery index limb , exception remote common femoral patch angioplasty separate least 2 cm target lesion ; 10 . Inability take require study medication allergy contrast adequately manage pre postprocedure medication ; 11 . Anticipated use IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior randomization ; 12 . Ipsilateral retrograde access ; 13 . Composite lesion length &gt; 15 cm normal proximal arterial segment duplex flow velocity measure ; 14 . Significant inflow disease . Successful treatment inflow disease allow prior target lesion treatment ; 15 . Known inadequate distal outflow ( &gt; 50 % stenosis distal popliteal and/or three tibial vessel ) , planned future treatment vascular disease distal target lesion ; 16 . Sudden symptom onset , acute vessel occlusion , acute subacute thrombus target vessel ; 17 . Severe calcification render lesion undilatable ; 18 . Use adjunctive treatment modality ( i.e . laser , atherectomy , cryoplasty , scoring/cutting balloon , etc . ) .</criteria>
