	<brief_summary>Failed back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) constitute frequent pathology , generate severe handicap patient represent considerable expense healthcare system . Neurostimulation currently validate treatment back pain technological limitation implantable spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) . The lack validate technique back pain relief prompt development newer device , include lead increase number contact ( 16 ) various geometric arrangement , objective cover large area attempt extend , steer , focus electric field stimulation within spinal cord region . This led company design new generation multicolumn surgical lead allow activation longitudinal transverse electric field ( multicolumn spinal cord stimulation , MSCS ) order provide bilateral paresthesia coverage back pain . The objective study compare analgesic efficacy MSCS ( use longitudinal transverse electric stimulation ) versus mono-column spinal cord stimulation ( CSCS , use axial stimulation , actually represent quadripolar octopolar lead ) treatment lumbar pain . A total 115 patient randomize either CSCS MSCS . Patients , 18 80 year old suffer refractory neuropathic pain radicular origin associate back pain include . Patients divide two group . One group MSCS 12 month new generation electrode implantation one group CSCS 6 month MSCS 6 12 month new generation electrode implantation . The following parameter evaluate study : overall pain VAS , leg pain VAS , back pain VAS , Oswestry disability index , Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating scale , Brief Anxiety Scale Euro Quality Life-5 Dimension Health questionnaire cost relation surgery patient management .</brief_summary>
