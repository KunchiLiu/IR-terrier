	<detailed_description>Aside obvious impact renal function , chronic hypertension significantly increase risk stroke , coronary artery disease , heart failure , vascular disease , believe mediate pathogenesis progression cardiac arrhythmia via remodel effect cardiac anatomy . This inextricable link hypertension cardiovascular health well describe , combine effect 40 % aging , obesity-battling Western world . Despite development numerous anti-hypertensive drug therapies—diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , alpha-adrenergic blocker , angiotensin-receptor blocker , calcium-channel blocker , beta blocker , vasodilators—designed block various multiple avenue complex renal-cardiovascular circuit , hypertension remain considerable , poorly manage , social economic burden . For various reason , include enormous health care cost treatment , 65 % hypertensive patient untreated and/or uncontrolled blood pressure ( BP ) . Of uncontrolled blood pressure , ~10 % resistant hypertension—defined elevated BP refractory treatment 3 antihypertensive agent different class . But even great problem ineffectiveness available therapy applicability . As observed illness , patient often great obstacle care . Convincing patient adhere life-long regimen expensive medication something cause immediate , palpable impact life , challenge feat today 's pressed-for-time physician . Therefore , particular interest profound promise recent study examine effect chronic blood pressure management catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation ( Symplicity HTN-1 , Krum et al , Lancet 373:1275 , 2009 ) . This proof-of-principle study reveal procedure could perform safely without procedure-related sequela 50 patient baseline office blood pressure 177±20 / 101±15 , 4.7 anti-hypertensive medication . At 12 month post-procedure , mean reduction office blood pressure remarkable -27/-17 mm Hg , concurrent 47 % reduction renal noradrenaline spillover . Importantly , favorable blood pressure result maintain 2 year ( see Fig ) . Then , Esler et al perform multicenter , randomize control trial compare catheter base renal denervation optimal medication therapy patient drug-resistant hypertension ( Symplicity HTN-2 , Lancet 2010 ; 376:1903-1909 ) . In study 106 randomized patient , 6-month office BPs denervation group decrease 32/12 mmHg ( SD 23/11 , baseline 178/96 mmHg , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , whereas differ baseline control group ( change 1/0 mmHg [ SD 21/10 ] , baseline 178/97 mmHg , p=N.S. ) . There serious procedure-related device-related complication . And recently , besides hydrostatic effect blood pressure , recently demonstrate RSDN significantly reduce LV mass improve diastolic function patient refractory hypertension ( J Am Coll Cardiol 2012 ; 59:901-9 ) . Together , favorable effect suggest may important beneficial prognostic implication RSDN patient resistant hypertension high cardiovascular risk . But note , Lancet study , catheter use renal ablation procedure specialize radiofrequency ablation catheter yet FDA-approved . To end , demonstrate RSDN safely perform patient use off-the-shelf solid-tip radiofrequency ablation catheter typically use cardiac ablation ( EuroIntervention 2012 ; 7 ( 9 ) :1077-80 ) . In addition , recently demonstrate standard off-the-shelf irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter also use achieve similar effect ( H.Ahmed / P.Neuzil / V.Reddy , JACC-Cardiovasc Interven , press ) . Briefly , drug-refractory hypertension patient , irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter ( Celsius Thermocool catheter , Biosense-Webster Inc , Diamond Bar , California ) use perform bilateral renal arterial sympathetic denervation . Briefly , 6 month period , 1 ) systolic/diastolic BPs ( determine 24-hour blood pressure monitoring ) decrease -21/-11 mmHg ( comparison , change 24-hour blood pressure change Symplicity HTN-2 -11/-7 mm Hg ) ; 2 ) patient experienced decrease systolic BP least 10 mm Hg ( range : 10-40 mm Hg ) ; 3 ) evidence renal artery stenosis aneurysm repeat angiography ; 4 ) significant decrease renal sympathetic activity 3 month : include metanephrine ( -12±4 , p=0.003 ) , normetanephrine ( -18±4 , p=0.0008 ) level , aldosterone level ( -60±33 ng/l , p=0.02 ) . There also evidence worsen renal function ( change serum creatinine -1 mmol/L , p=0.4 ) . These data provide proof-of-principle RSDN perform use off-the-shelf saline-irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter . [ Of note , two major reason off-the-shelf catheter use : ) lack availability specialize RF ablation catheter use Lancet study , ii ) unlike specialize RF catheter , catheter employ saline-irrigated ablation element . In theory , saline-irrigation advantage less likely cause thrombus char formation catheter ablation , also likely cause tissue surface spar ablate deep tissue . ] The purpose trial evaluate long term safety efficacy catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation 500 hypertensive patient follow 2 year . Study Rationale The recently publish result Symplicity HTN-2 trial ( Renal sympathetic denervation patient treatment resistant hypertension ) establish therapeutic benefit catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation hypertension , enormous potential management large challenge patient population . The propose prospective non-randomized multi-center trial attempt confirm expand promise data evaluate long-term efficacy ( safety ) renal sympathetic denervation patient chronic hypertension . Patients enroll trial follow 4 year .</detailed_description>
