	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfusion affect intestinal blood flow premature infant feeding , whether return normal intestinal blood flow pattern occur within 48 hour blood transfusion . Abnormal intestinal response feeding ( insufficient postprandial blood flow increase order digest give feeding volume overall decrease intestinal blood flow ) may predispose infant feed intolerance serious intestinal disease call necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) relatively common heart condition find young preterm infant lead decrease blood flow different organ , include intestine . Thus , determination presence absence PDA important part study , since relevant confound variable . In study , investigator assess intestinal blood flow use sonogram measure velocity superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) , artery supply intestine , pre- 45 minute post feed . The investigator also use echocardiogram determine presence absence PDA . Each set measurement do immediately transfusion , 24 48 hour transfusion . Specific Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize infant attenuate postprandial blood flow velocity immediate posttransfusion state compare pretransfusion value . The investigator hypothesize normal , pretransfusion postprandial blood flow velocity achieve 48 hr blood transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) death intestinal tissue . It often affect premature sick baby . NEC occur line intestinal wall die tissue fall . NEC known complication prematurity high morbidity mortality . About 7 13 % low birth weight infant admit Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) develop NEC , mortality range 10 44 % ( 1,2,3 ) . NEC consider multifactorial disorder converge common final clinical presentation associate several etiologic mechanism , include ischemia ( eg reperfusion ) , infection ( eg , gut colonization ) , mechanical injury ( eg , viscosity , embolic ) , iatrogenic factor ( eg catheter , excessive enteral feeding ) , immunological barrier dysfunction ( 1,13,4,5 ) To date , single , unifying consensus causation ( 6 ) . Newly , association NEC Packed Red Blood Cell ( PRBC ) transfusion subject recent debate . Several retrospective study report increase incidence NEC 22 hr ( 7 ) 48-72 hr PRBC transfusion ( 8 ) increase odds NEC development within 48 hrs posttransfusion ( 9 ) . Singh , measure strength association NEC PRBC transfusion describe association strong &lt; 24hrs , less strong &lt; 48 hr absent 96 hr ( 10 ) . Importantly , majority infant study stable premature neonates full enteral feed , decompensated developed NEC transfuse . Based poor evidence , many NICUs implementing policy feed premature infant blood transfusion ( 11 ) . A small recent prospective trial ( 8 ) report decreased incidence NEC ( 5.3 1.3 % ) feed withheld transfusion . Similarly , limited investigation superior mesenteric artery ( blood vessel supply greatest volume blood intestinal tract ) blood flow velocity ( SMA BFV ) reveal expect post-prandial increase SMA BFV disappear follow PRBC , place feed neonate receive blood transfusion high risk NEC ( 12 ) . This initial study several major limitation , enrol large mature preterm neonate lesser risk PRBC transfusion relate NEC , exclude infant patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) , common clinical condition preterm neonate , lose 11 22 patient follow study ( hence `` normalization '' post-prandial blood flow velocity find potentially safe time point feed reintroduction could suggest study result ) use relatively less commonly transfuse PRBC volumes longer period time . In study , investigator intend understand hemodynamic consequence PRBC transfusion low birth weight ( VLBW ) neonates evaluate pre-and post-prandial SMA BFV neonates fed transfusion different time point correlate relevant clinical outcome measure . The investigator anticipate result study use clinician help guide make decision regard safety administer PRBC transfusion VLBW neonate .</detailed_description>
