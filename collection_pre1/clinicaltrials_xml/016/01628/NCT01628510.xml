	<detailed_description>Infants bear prematurely high risk developmental impairment . Subsequently , preterm infant often see therapy service neonatal intensive care unit often recommend early intervention service discharge . One early intervention preterm infant Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) positioning , alter position significant impact later function . Preterm infant position disadvantage early development . The final trimester pregnancy promote flexed position , infant crowd uterine environment experience rapid brain growth , mediate flexion midline orientation . When infant bear soon , miss utero flexion position . They lack central nervous system maturity enable flexion tone strength movement gravity . In addition , preterm infant confront altered sensory experience , result static , extend positioning environmental factor associate life medical intervention outside womb . Therefore , early transition extrauterine environment challenge premature infant , face overwhelm sensory stimuli body yet prepared process . It demonstrate position preterm infant differs full term infant . The tightly flexed position full term newborn call physiological flexion . It involve symmetrical flexion extremity , shoulder protraction , posterior pelvic tilt . Physiological flexion developmental importance . This positioning enable infant remain motorically physiologically organize facilitate self-soothing self-regulation behavior , suck hand mouth contact . The flexed position provide infant sense containment security , mimic intrauterine environment . In addition , physiological flexion associate great extremity contact trunk , imitate womb give infant sensory feedback . The benefit early physiological flexion long term benefit development . Many neonatal reflex , upper low extremity recoil , palmar plantar grasp , pull sit mediate flexion response . These early flexion response form foundation later movement acquisition . Physiological flexion also promote later development normal balance posture . Ideal posture support development head control , sit , crawl , walk , transfer one position another , manipulate object . Due miss third trimester , preterm infant risk assume suboptimal position , thus miss early benefit physiological flexion . In utero , fetuses experience attenuate stimulus . Therefore , sensory experience outside womb overwhelming infant bear prematurely ( 3 ) . As result , preterm infant easily stress , particularly properly position . Stress produce severe consequence preterm infant include respiratory problem intraventricular hemorrhage . Infants unsupported position may frantic movement startle response stress , therefore difficulty achieve deep sleep state necessary growth brain development . This lead extend hospital stay . Optimal position enables premature infant well cope stressor bring hand face mouth self-soothing . Positioning aid past aim promote containment increase flexion . However , ability promote flexion enable infant movement remain problematic . The new Dandle Roo Dandle Wrap develop NICU professional support neurodevelopment preterm infant . The Dandle Roo/Wrap provide around contact , containment , proprioceptive input , ( closely mimic uterine environment ) decrease excitability promote self-regulation , also allow movement recoil back flexion . Despite current evidence effective positioning intervention preterm infant , recent meta-analysis developmental care cite need research specific intervention , position , short-term long-term clinical outcome . No study date examine effect new Dandle Roo Dandle Wrap clinical neurobehavioral outcome preterm infant . Therefore , propose randomize controlled trial new Dandle Roo/ Dandle Wrap , postulate infant position Dandle Roo/Dandle Wrap experience beneficial effect . Objectives : Hypothesis - Preterm infant position Dandle Roo Dandle Wrap experience well neurodevelopmental outcome , less brain injury need respiratory support , short hospital stay infant position traditional NICU positioning aid . Specific Aim - To conduct randomize controlled trial effect Dandle Roo/Dandle Wrap versus traditional NICU positioning administer birth discharge NICU neurodevelopmental outcome , brain injury , need respiratory support , length stay infant bear less 32 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) . Subjects : A power analysis reveal 86 infant need detect difference neurobehavioral outcome follow position intervention . To account attrition , 100 infant recruit . Inclusion Criteria - This prospective cohort premature infant bear 32 week less PMA . This cohort hospitalize NICU St. Louis Children 's Hospital Barnes Special Care Nursery St. Louis , Missouri recruit within 72 hour birth . Exclusion Criteria - Infants know suspected congenital anomaly birth infant moribund severe sepsis respiratory distress define physiologic instability require &gt; 80 % FiO2 6 hour and/or 2 ionotropic drug ( exclude hydrocortisone ) , attend recruit physician ' opinion infant likely expire within 24 hour would tolerate handle protocol Randomization - As soon birth possible , later 1 week admission , consecutive new admission meeting inclusion criterion recruit study . Upon parent 's signing informed consent , infant randomly assign either Dandle Roo/Dandle Wrap position traditional NICU positioning entire length stay . The position protocol assign study infant would clearly post infant 's bedside . Members research team would routinely check ensure infant treatment arm position correctly Dandle Roo/Dandle Wrap answer question . In addition , log sheet would place infant 's bedspace nursing shift . Here nurse would instruct identify infant position assign position aid would able identify reason position implement specific shift . Positioning protocol would utilize time infant rest crib , isolette , open warmer . However , infant would take position aid periodically hand care , bedside evaluation , enable close observation acute episode . In addition , parent could take infant position hold interaction . Clinical Data Collection : For infant enrol , routine clinical information infant 's medical record would access . In addition , infant would undergo neurobehavioral test member research team hospitalization . One train certified evaluator conduct neurobehavioral test study infant . Testing would conduct 35 week gestation 41 week gestation . Neurobehavioral assessment use Neonatal NICU Network Scales ( NNNS ) . Scores range 0-13 follow subscales : habituation , attention , handle , arousal , regulation , quality movement , reflex , asymmetrical response , hypertonicity , hypotonicity , stress/abstinence sign . High score optimal follow subscales : habituation , attention , regulation , quality movement . Low score optimal follow subscales : handling , arousal , reflex , asymmetrical response , hypertonicity , hypotonicity stress/abstinence sign . Developmental test would conduct infant medically stable able tolerate exam . Video tap neurobehavioral assessment perform store anonymously . Videotapes conduct enable close observation infant evaluation process later score test videotape . In addition , test ongoing developmental follow clinic ( Washington University Neonatal Developmental Follow-Up Clinic ) would access outcomes 6 month , 1 year , 2 year , 3 year , available . Dissemination result : The finding research : - Published peer review scientific medical literature - Presented local international conference - Disseminated , end study period , parent whose infant enrol study express interest study outcome . Potential Benefits : Ideal neonatal positioning may improve neurodevelopment decrease brain injury need respiratory support , subsequent good developmental outcome . Optimizing position facilitate optimal utero positioning time period could result short hospital stay , decrease expenditure healthcare dollar . Early neurobehavioral testing , part study protocol , enable parent well understand strengths weakness exhibit infant enable early therapeutic intervention . Benefits society include good understanding effective positioning NICU well possible understand early positioning critical later function . A member research team conduct comprehensive developmental test infant NICU stay . Parents informed test result prior NICU discharge . The WUNDER research group continuously review data result return report adverse effect monthly St. Louis Children 's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Joint Practice Committee . The biostatistician also independently review data result report significant adverse effect monthly WUNDER research group Joint Practice Committee . All serious adverse event report IRB : ) death - immediately ; b ) life-threatening within 7 calendar day ; c ) significant adverse event ( SAEs ) within 15 calendar day use Electronic SAE System . Data Analysis : Data analyze use linear logistic regression model biostatistician . Data review throughout duration study . All data maintain strict confidence available member research team . It hold secure format password-protected computer record . Hard copy record identify study number store lock file cabinet . A log study number identify data keep site PI separate lock file cabinet . All file cabinet contain data inside locked office corridor accessible badge access .</detailed_description>
