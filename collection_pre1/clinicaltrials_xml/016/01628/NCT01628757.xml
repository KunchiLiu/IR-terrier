	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer one major health problem chinese woman . Besides surgery radiotherapy , neoadjuvant chemotherapy prove effective program many study . However , patient respond well neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Knowing therapeutic effect neoadjuvant chemotherapy receive reduce economic burden , also importantly save time take suitable treatment .

	<brief_title>Model Development Prospective Validation Predict Response Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer one commom malignant disease among femails , lot harm young old woman , especially people undeveloped area . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy investigate treatment cervical cancer patient since 1980s around world（Sardi J , Di Paola G , Giaroli A , Sananes C , Burlando S Rueda NG，1988；Mancuso S , Benedetti Panici P , Greggi S Scambia G，1989.） . Clinicians find neoadjuvant chemotherapy help diminish tumor size , eliminate distant metastasis ; thus , patient get opportunity surgery ( Benedetti Panici P , Scambia G , Greggi S , Di Roberto P , Baiocchi G Mancuso S，1988 ) . As result , woman may chance ovarian function preserve ; plus surgery post-surgery therapy , woman may also able cure area sophisticated radiotherapy utility availble . As development science techonology chemotherapy cervical cancer , neoadjuvant therapy also bring China . And since 1990s , investigation neoadjuvant chemotherapy China carry teaching hospital China 's lead famous university develop ares . Strengthened prosperous economy country , neoadjuvant chemotherapy begin familar China 's Gyneclogists end 20th century . Since begin 21th century , 's early 2000s , neoadjuvant chemotherapy introduce new therapeutic therapy method . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also show advantage ( Chang TC , Lai CH , Hong JH , Hsueh S , Huang KG , Chou HH , Tseng CJ , Tsai CS , Chang JT , Lin CT , Chang HH , Chao PJ , Ng KK , Tang SG Soong YK , 2000 ) carry hospital , approvements institution . Response short-term long-term response evaluate . Clinical response , also know early reponse , also one short-term response , also evaluate accord response criterion . Patients ' toxicity long-term survival also record evaluate . The treatment , well study , carry accordance approve guideline . All eligible patient give write informed consent therapy . All protocol approve ethical committee university institution , update renovate Declaration Helsinki . Since middle stage late stage 2000s , clinician study neoadjuvant chemotherapy top university hospital well hospital , take chemotherapy regimens hospital institution treatment cervical cancer patient . Some also take part study u . And since begin 2010s , hospital take part neoadjuvant study u , number institution updated updation protocol ethical approvements . Patients fulfilled inclusion criterion include exclusion disable patient , Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 70，hepatic dysfunction , cardiac dysfunction . Although Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy treat standard treatment cervical cancer ( ref 4-6 ) , neoadjuvant chemotherapy also show advantage ( Chang TC , Lai CH , Hong JH , Hsueh S , Huang KG , Chou HH , Tseng CJ , Tsai CS , Chang JT , Lin CT , Chang HH , Chao PJ , Ng KK , Tang SG Soong YK , 2000 ) : facilitate premenopause woman ovarian function preserve addition facility radical surgery , people good response tumor disappear completely neosdjuvant chemotherapy . This may open new window young woman want fertility ( include uterus ovary ) preserve . And mechanism chemotherapy-response chemo-resistence still need widely deeply explore , also important clinician understand pathway chemo-drugs ' metablism avoid toxic effect chemo-drugs .</detailed_description>
