	<brief_title>Frequency Modulated Neural Stimulation ( FREMS ) Symptomatic Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic neuropathy common potentially disabling complication patient type 1 type 2 diabetes due damage peripheral nerve cause chronic hyperglycemia . The common clinical sign symptom diabetic neuropathy include numbness , diminish sensation painful symptom , burning , pin needle , intolerable pain hyperaesthesia low extremity . Different class drug , analgesic , antidepressant anti-epileptics variably efficacious pain relief , unfortunately unable revert natural history disease . A wide range electrotherapy propose non-pharmacological treatment diabetic neuropathy . The rationale use electric magnetic stimulation potential enhancement microcirculation endoneural blood flow , possibly counteract nerve ischemic damage , together yet poorly understood mechanism , mask pain interfere pain gate control . A number study report efficacy different electrotherapy , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , pulsed-dose electrical stimulation , peripheral nerve , nerve root , spinal cord , deep brain epidural motor cortex stimulation , pulse ( electro- ) magnetic field static magnetic field , high-frequency external muscle stimulation , high-tone external muscle stimulation external muscle stimulation . However , electrotherapy , TENS currently recommend treatment painful diabetic neuropathy American Academy Neurology . Recently , novel transcutaneous frequency-modulated electromagnetic neural stimulation ( also name Frequency Rhythmic Electrical Modulation System , FREMS ) , develop . FREMS consist sequence modulate electrical stimulus varies automatically term pulse frequency , duration voltage amplitude . FREMS test pilot randomize , cross-over study , reduce diabetic neuropathy pain ameliorate sensory tactile vibration perception threshold motor nerve conduction velocity compare sham treatment . The aim study test efficacy safety FREMS multicentre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study enrol large population symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy , repeat treatment session post-treatment follow-up adequate length .</detailed_description>
