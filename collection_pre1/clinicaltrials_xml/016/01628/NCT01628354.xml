	<brief_title>Study Investigate Safety Efficacy Ranibizumab Patients With Choroidal Neovascularisation Due Causes Other Than Age Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 . That safe treat patient choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) secondary cause age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) ranibizumab 2 . That treatment CNV secondary cause AMD ranibizumab effective 3 . That treatment pigment epithelial detachment ( PEDs ) secondary CNV AMD ranibizumab safe 4 . That treatment pigment epithelial detachment ( PEDs ) secondary CNV AMD ranibizumab effective Objectives The primary objective study : - investigate medium term safety efficacy Ranibizumab treatment CNV secondary cause AMD ( eg . angioid streak , pseudoxanthoma elasticum , trauma , macular dystrophy , ocular inflammation/choroiditis idiopathic cause ) . - investigate medium term safety efficacy Ranibizumab treatment PEDs secondary CNV AMD These group patient date exclude multicentre trial demonstrate significant benefit Ranibizumab treatment AMD . Strategic goal To explore safety efficacy intravitreal ranibizumab patient CNV due cause AMD currently approve suitable treatment . Our goal also explore safety efficacy intravitreal ranibizumab patient PEDs primary manifestation CNVM secondary AMD . To use treatment protocol frequency intraocular injection minimise . Background Although stimuli induce choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) unknown , evidence suggest angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) basic fibroblast growth factor play role pathogenesis CNV . VEGF polypeptide secrete retinal pigmented epithelium exerts potent proliferative effect specifically vascular endothelial cell . The presence supernormal amount VEGF surgically excise human CNV provide evidence VEGF contribute CNV lesion formation AMD also CNV due cause . In CNV , newly form vessel tendency leak blood fluid , cause symptom scotoma metamorphopsia . The new vessel accompany proliferation fibrous tissue . This complex new vessel fibrous tissue destroy photoreceptors within 3 24 month . At time CNV destroy retinal tissue form , lesion continue grow throughout macula , result progressive , severe irreversible vision loss . Without treatment , affect eye poor central vision within 2 year . Ranibizumab anti-VEGF antibody fragment block VEGF activity patient neovascular AMD . Its mechanism action involve form complex VEGF thereby prevent bind receptor . It derive 149kDa parent murine monoclonal anti¬VEGF antibody consist solely 48 kDa single antigen¬binding portion monoclonal antibody without constant region ; thus ranibizumab approximately one-third size full-length antibody . With reduced size , ranibizumab able penetrate efficiently many retinal cell layer follow intravitreal injection compare full¬length MAb ( Mordenti et al , 1999 ) . More 900 patient treat ranibizumabin clinicla trial date . It register use USa available Australia special access scheme . Results show ranibizumab safe well tolerate . Common ocular side effect mild moderate include conjunctival hemorrhage , eye pain vitreous floater . Serious ocular adverse event uncommon ( &lt; 1 % ) include uveitis endophthalmitis . No discernible pattern change circulate level VEGF observe . In multiple dose study , majority patient experience little change intraocular pressure ( lOP ) treatment . Efficacy treatment CNV secondary AMD also demonstrate several study . In recent phase III study , approximately 95 % patient treat ranibizumab avoid moderate vision loss compare 62 % sham-controlled group 71-75 % maintain improved vision compare 29 % sham-controlled group 12 month . Vision improve 15 letter 25 % patient treat 0.3 mg ranibizumab 34 % patient treat 0.5 mg ranibizumab compare 5 % patient sham-controlled group . This treatment benefit observe 12 month maintain 24 month . Subretinal choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) occur due condition AMD pseudoxanthoma elasticum , trauma , macular dystrophy choroiditis ( inflammation choroid ) . Often , patient CNV due condition AMD mention relatively young compare without AMD , much great chance retain good vision CNV control . Currently , treatment available patient group photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) Visudyne conventional laser therapy . Neither treatment however , offer much hope improve vision . Our experience use PDT Visudyne individual , relative patient AMD , non AMD treatment need far few treatment final visual acuity much great . Given CNV secondary cause respond PDT , extrapolate CNV respond new generation anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) agent Ranibizumab show effective treatment CNV secondary AMD . To date , multicentre trial ranibizumab exclude non AMD patient thus limit access new generation intravitreal anti - VEGF treatment . CNV secondary AMD result pigment epithelial detachment ( PEDs ) lead devastate loss vision . PEDs always difficult treat , often rip result treatment PDT laser . To date proven treatment relatively common presentation CNV secondary AMD . They always exclude multi-centred international study Ranibizumab active area CNV make 50 % lesion . This pigment epithelial detachment consider part lesion consider active part lesion . As little information know potential effective treatment new generation anti VEGF drug . There case report resolution PEDs improvement vision treatment Bevacizumab ( derive parent molecule ranibizumab ) use label set treatment wet AMD . We believe PEDs similarly respond treatment ranibizumab .</detailed_description>
