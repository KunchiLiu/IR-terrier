	<brief_summary>The objective monocentric investigator initiate exploratory clinical trial optimize allergen delivery across epidermal barrier . The cornified outer epidermal layer represent main barrier towards entry viable epidermal layer . In latter aim target allergen uptake professional antigen present cell , call Langerhans cell . At time little allergen possible deliver dermis . The latter contains high density sensitize mast cell elicit local reaction also high density blood vessel could lead systemic distribution allergen therefore systemic allergic reaction . In birch pollen allergic individual compare different method prepare skin application allergen . We subsequently apply titrated allergen dos prepare skin area determine dose start observe mast cell degranulation manifest hive . This allow determination maximal tolerate allergen dose skin preparation method . The skin preparation method compare : - Single prick prick lancet ( Entaco LTD. , Redditch , Worcestershire , UK , distribute Stallergenes® ) . - Tape strip conventional adhesive Tape ( Tesa-film® ) . - Microchanneling Micro Needle Patch ( Micro Skin System , 3M® ) . The method strongly connect routine diagnostics allergy low risk associate . The clinical trial protocol submit local Ethics Committee . This comparison skin preparation method determination maximal tolerate allergen dose help u improve epicutaneous allergen immunotherapy , potential make allergen specific immunotherapy considerably shorter safer , also convenient patient . Skin preparation microneedle patch significantly less painful conventional injection self administer . This help improve acceptance allergen specific immunotherapy , well treatment compliance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Study Determine Allergic Skin Activity After Different Skin Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION The prevalence allergic diseases continuously increase , reach prevalence 30 % industrialized country . In Switzerland , 2 million people affected IgE-mediated allergy report Swiss Center Allergy , Skin Asthma Swiss Society Allergology Immunology ( SSAI ) . By subcutaneous injection gradually increase allergen dos , conventional subcutaneous SIT ( SCIT ) find reduce inappropriate T-helper ( Th ) 2 response IgE production . Due risk systemic allergic side effect , typical therapy duration 3-5 year requirement 50-80 injection , patient acceptance SCIT low less 5 % allergy patient choose undergo SCIT . A recently rediscover route allergen administration via epidermis procedure call epicutaneous immunotherapy ( EPIT ) . The skin attractive administration route immunotherapy easily accessible well play important role immune system consist keratinocytes , Langerhans cell ( LC ) , dermal dendritic cell ( DC ) . A major challenge EPIT overcome physiological barrier function skin . In order deliver allergen immunological effector cell skin , allergen must transport outermost keratinize layer epidermis , call stratum corneum . The stratum corneum 10-20μm thick impermeable molecule great 500 Da . Proteins , allergens , passively permeate across skin therefore enhancement strategy need enable transfer . Advances microtechnology might contribute improve situation allow miniaturization mechanic structure . As stratum corneum 10-20μm thick , propose Henry et al. , microneedles small ten hundred micron , could use penetrate stratum corneum . Such new method overcome skin barrier raise question influence different type skin injury pattern allergic skin reactivity . Namely , important role expose area ( microneedles ) , depth injury ( skin pricking ) keratinocyte activation . This physiological question focus study . PRODUCTS In order investigate physiological reaction concern different skin condition allergen exposition follow products/techniques choose purpose induce different skin condition reproducible way . Prick lancet : For prick skin preparation , sterile prick lancets 1mm point skin test use : prick lancet , produce Entaco LTD. , Redditch , Worcestershire , UK distribute Stallergenes® . They use allergy diagnostics daily routine . Adhesive tape : For tape strip skin preparation conventional tape use ( Tesafilm® ) . Microneedle array : To induce large number microchannels maximal depth 150μm cornea layer , solid Microstructured Transdermal System ( sMTS ) 3M® use . This system small patch 351 tiny needle , market US intend prepare skin transdermal application topical dermatology product . Epicutaneous allergen solution : For epicutaneous administration four ten-fold serial dilution ( 10 HEP , 1 HEP , 0.1 HEP 0.01HEP/ml ) register allergen extract birch pollen ( Betula verrucosa ) ( Soluprick® , ALK-Abelló A/S , Hørsholm , Denmark ) use everyday allergy diagnostic practice . Histamine positive control use 10 mg/ml solution contain excipients serve negative control . This open-label physiological investigation allergic skin reactivity epicutaneous allergen exposition allergic patient compare different method skin preparation . The focus study skin preparation specific allergen allergy , reason homogeneity single allergic disease , birch pollen allergy choose basis test . In order evaluate effect different skin preparation technique intra-individual comparison skin reactivity term immediate phase I reaction serial dilution birch pollen extract choose . The serial dilution approach allow dose dependent effect evaluation determination mean allergen concentration yield similar skin reaction - thus difference explain mainly different skin preparation allow quantitative comparison technique . HYPOTHESIS We determine three different skin preparation technique use high protein concentration allergen preparation ( Ch10 ) elicit wheal area size histamine 10 mg/ml calculate . The Null hypothesis therefore would : Ch10 significantly different three skin preparation technique .</detailed_description>
