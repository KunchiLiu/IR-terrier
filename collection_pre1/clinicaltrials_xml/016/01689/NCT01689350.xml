	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Cyclophosphamide Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclophosphamide ( CPA ) one successful therapy severe Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . However , cyclophosphamide cause severe side effect , include bone marrow suppression , infection , gastrointestinal reaction , hemorrhagic cystitis , etc . Significant variation efficacy toxicity CPA observe . Since development applicable therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) cyclophosphamide report , help improve efficacy reduce toxicity SLE treatment . However , TDM passive strategy usually lag behind appearance toxicity . Therefore，it especially crucial give individual genotype-based personal prescription cyclophosphamide order gain effective therapy . Thus , purpose study compare genotype-based personal prescription cyclophosphamide traditional prescription , order verify efficacy genotype-based personal prescription .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The American College Rheumatology establish eleven criteria 1982 , revise 1997 classificatory instrument operationalise definition SLE clinical trial . 1 . Malar rash ( rash cheek ) . 2 . Discoid rash ( red , scaly patch skin cause scarring ) . 3 . Serositis : Pleurisy ( inflammation membrane around lung ) pericarditis ( inflammation membrane around heart ) . 4 . Oral ulcer ( include oral nasopharyngeal ulcer ) . 5 . Arthritis : nonerosive arthritis two peripheral joint , tenderness , swell , effusion . 6 . Photosensitivity ( exposure ultraviolet light cause rash , symptom SLE flareups ) . 7 . Blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia ( low red blood cell count ) leukopenia ( white blood cell count &lt; 4000/µl ) , lymphopenia ( &lt; 1500/µl ) thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 100000/µl ) absence offend drug . Hypocomplementemia also see , due either consumption C3 C4 immune complexinduced inflammation congenitally complement deficiency , may predispose SLE . 8 . Renal disorder : More 0.5 g per day protein urine cellular cast see urine microscope . 9 . Antinuclear antibody test positive . 10 . Immunologic disorder : Positive antiSmith , antids DNA , antiphospholipid antibody , and/or false positive serological test syphilis . Presence antiss DNA 70 % case ( though also positive rheumatic disease healthy person ) . 11 . Neurologic disorder : Seizures psychosis . For purpose identify patient clinical study , person SLE 4 11 symptom present simultaneously serially two separate occasion . In meantime , case one follow condition ; 1 . HIV ( ) ; 2 .
