	<brief_title>Strategy Improve Antiplatelet Therapy Adherence After Coronary Stent Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Acute coronary syndrome first cause mortality cardiology . Development stent dual antiplatelet therapy lead important decline morbi-mortality . Despite , risk recurrent event mortality stent implantation remain substantial , especially within first six month . Non-adherence antiplatelet therapy major modifiable risk factor expose adverse outcome follow stent implantation identify major risk factor stent thrombosis . Prior intervention improve medication adherence cardiovascular population produce mixed result specifically assess compliance antiplatelet therapy patient treat stent implantation acute coronary syndrome . It currently unknown intervention improve antiplatelet therapy compliance six month stenting discharge improve medication adherence clinical outcome cost-effective OBJECTIVES : investigator propose assess effectiveness multi-faceted patient-centered adherence intervention among patient follow stent implantation improve adherence antiplatelet therapy ( primary aim ) . Secondary aim ass whether intervention improve : 1 . Cardiovascular event : ACS , stent thrombosis , - hospitalization coronary angiography , new revascularization , all-cause mortality 2 . Cost-effectiveness . METHOD : Investigators propose six month , mono-site patient-level randomize control trial evaluate , relative usual care , multi-faceted patient-centered intervention improve adherence antiplatelet treatment among stented patient follow ACS . The study enroll 800 patient intervention versus usual care 6 month one university hospital ( CHU Timone , Marseille , France ) . The propose intervention base several conceptual framework ( Chronic Care Model Medication Adherence Model ) adapt element prior successfully adherence intervention , include : collaborative care , patient education , tailor medication regimen , daily mobile phone short message service ( SMS ) . The primary analysis comparison adherence antiplatelet therapy use specific laboratory test drug effect . Secondary analysis compare incidence clinical endpoint group , cost-effectiveness analysis perform . All analyse intention treat</detailed_description>
