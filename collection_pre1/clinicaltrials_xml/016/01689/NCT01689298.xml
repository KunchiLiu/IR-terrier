	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare ability isolated sample uterine muscle tissue ( tissue bath ) contract presence various drug . The drug study -- uterotonics -- typically use contract uterus pregnant patient continue bleed delivery . Oxytocin old standard , seem suffer desensitization phenomenon . Carbetocin , similar drug , recently suggest clinician replacement oxytocin directly certain type Cesarean section . The investigator test isolated uterine muscle sample pre-treatment oxytocin OR nothing ( control ) increase concentration oxytocin OR carbetocin . Contractile measure measure compare group . The investigator hypothesize oxytocin pre-treatment reduce contraction oxytocin- carbetocin-induced contraction , oxytocin carbetocin induce different pattern contraction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) major cause maternal mortality morbidity . In 80 % case PPH , primary cause failure uterus contract delivery baby , require treatment mother uterotonic drug ( drug use contract uterus thus prevent bleed ) . Patients participate study ask donate small sample uterine tissue Cesarean section , test laboratory ability contract response uterotonics oxytocin carbetocin . We seek good understand effect drug compare contractile capability isolate uterine tissue .</detailed_description>
