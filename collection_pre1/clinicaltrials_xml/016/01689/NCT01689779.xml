	<brief_summary>While vitamin D insufficiency [ 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 30 ng/mL ] common general population , hypovitaminosis D may affect 40-80 % patient perioperative setting . Recent evidence also suggest surgical stress may associate 40 % reduction circulate 25 ( OH ) D level compare preoperative value . Moreover , derangement perioperative 25 ( OH ) D level may sustain 3 month surgery . This find potential implication regard modifiable risk factor surgical site infection ( SSIs ) , account nearly 40 % nosocomial infection . On aggregate , SSIs result 3.7 million extra hospital day per annum add burden $ 1.6 billion annual healthcare cost . A grow body evidence suggest robust postoperative immune function associate low risk SSIs . At time , vitamin D increasingly recognize key regulator innate adaptive immune system . Yet , optimization perioperative vitamin D status remain grossly understudied . Although overarch aim study impact vitamin D status SSIs , focus current investigation determine whether administration `` bolus '' oral dose cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) preoperative set alters vitamin D status perioperative setting ( compare placebo ) . The investigator elect conduct current study patient undergo colorectal surgery since patient historically high risk develop SSIs therefore would ideal future investigation .</brief_summary>
