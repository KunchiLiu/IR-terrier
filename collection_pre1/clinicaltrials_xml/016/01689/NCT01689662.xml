	<brief_summary>The folate receptor ( FR ) overexpressed many different cancer type , include renal cell carcinoma . Besides help diagnosis cancer , folate-targeted imaging agent could provide effective method identify folate receptor-positive ( FR+ ) cancer patient may benefit folate-targeted therapy . Up 40 subject , know strongly suspect metastatic renal cell carcinoma least one target lesion detect diagnostic imaging procedure ( e.g . ultrasonography , CT , MRI ) , enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy FolateScan ( Technetium Tc 99m EC20 ) Subjects With Suspected Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational new drug ( FolateScan Technetium Tc 99m EC20 ) folate-targeted diagnostic radiopharmaceutical design bind folate receptor . The folate receptor glycoprotein over-expressed many type cancer cell minimally distribute normal tissue . Folate conjugate bind folate receptor high affinity bring cell via endocytosis . In contrast , folic acid enters normal cell via reduced folate carrier , pathway entirely inaccessible folate conjugate . Therefore , folate conjugate specific cancer cell . Endocyte 's folate-targeted delivery system apply towards target diagnostic imaging agent ( 111In-DTPA-Folate ) ovarian cancer tumor . This proof-of-principle study design demonstrate ability folate target drug folate-receptor-positive ( FR+ ) cancer tissue .</detailed_description>
