An attractive area research regard immune manipulation recover patient 's immune response his/her tumor , strategy advantage natural potentially long-lasting . [ 1 ] We propose combine immunotherapy radiotherapy direct metastatic site , create `` hub '' vivo immunization tumor , enable `` tumor rejection '' metastatic site . This `` vivo immunization '' explore viable alternative individualize vaccine approach . Preclinical data generate u others support `` proof principle '' clinical trial may open field alternative use radiotherapy novel partnership cancer immunotherapy . [ 2 ] In addition , propose perform immune-monitoring patient accrue trial generate important information hypothesis-driven research mechanism behind clinical finding , test laboratory . The specific aim study : 1 . To explore induction immunity-mediated tumor response outside radiation field ( abscopal effect ) radiation/Ipilimumab metastatic melanoma , estimate compare response rate patient treat Ipilimumab alone ( Arm A ) versus ipilimumab radiation ( Arm B ) . 2 . To compare induction T-cell response patient metastatic melanoma treat either ipilimumab alone combination radiation . All patient metastatic melanoma least 2 measurable site disease eligible . Extent metastatic disease record CT scan MRI therapy . Patients randomize Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV 90 minute alone versus Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV 90 minute plus radiotherapy one measurable lesion , 6 Gy deliver daily x 5 day ( Monday Friday ) ( conformally IMRT/IGRT , maximally spare normal tissue ) , total 30 Gy . For patient assign Ipilimumab/RT arm , Ipilimumab treatment start radiotherapy , dose give day 4 first radiotherapy fraction . All patient ipilimumab infusion repeat Days 25 , 46 67 . Patients re-imaged ( CT image MRI ) Week 12 evaluate response ( defined objective response another metastatic site outside radiation field ) . The main immunological end-point induction boost treatment induce T cell ( CD4+ CD8+ ) B cell define antigen approach . In addition , magnitude duration T- B-cell response examine . Treatment-induced response calculate difference pre-treatment measurement measurement different time point blood collect ( time evaluation ) patient . The percentage patient induction treatment-induced T- B-cell response report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document ; Histologic diagnosis locally unresectable , metastatic melanoma . Any BRAF status permit Any prior therapy permit except prior therapy ipilimumab . Patients must least 2 distinct measurable metastatic site , one least 1 cm large large diameter may additional nonmeasurable establish metastatic lesion ( i.e . bone metastasis ) . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define initial laboratory test : WBC 2000/uL ANC 1000/uL Platelets 50 x 103/uL Hemoglobin 8 g/dL Creatinine 3.0 x ULN AST/ALT 2.5 x ULN patient without liver metastasis Bilirubin 3.0 x ULN , ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ; Performance status ECOG 01 Karnofsky &gt; 50 % ; Men woman , age &gt; 18 year old age ; Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Stable brain metastasis least 4 week steroid dependent ; Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 8 week study . Patients lesion outside field radiation thus nullify ability measure abscopal effect ; Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease exclude study patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ; Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea ; Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( one month prior dose ipilimumab ) ; Concomitant therapy following : IL2 , interferon nonstudy immunotherapy regimens ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ; Women unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 8 week cessation study drug , positive pregnancy test baseline , pregnant breastfeeding ; Persons reproductive potential must agree use utilize adequate method contraception throughout treatment least 8 week study drug stop ; Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious ) illness .</criteria>
