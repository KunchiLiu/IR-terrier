	<criteria>All subject must meet follow criterion include study : 1 . Healthy male female subject 18 50 year age , inclusive . Healthy determine medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory measurement perform screen ; 2 . BMI great equal 18 kg/m2 exceed 32 kg/m2 ; 3 . Female subject childbearing potential must plan pregnancy , pregnant , lactating , must negative serum pregnancy test result enrollment study , must willing use contraception specify section 12.8.3 abstain sexual activity duration study least 3 week discontinuation study drug ; 4 . Male subject partner childbearing potential must use two method contraception , one must barrier method , duration study 30 day completion ; 5 . Agree abstain alcohol consumption 3 day dose throughout duration study ( include Study Day 13 visit ) ; 6 . Agree abstain strenuous exercise 3 day dose throughout duration study ( include Study Day 13 visit ) ; 7 . Able effectively communicate investigator test center personnel ; 8 . Able participate , willing give write informed consent comply study restriction . All subject follow condition characteristic must exclude study : 1 . Currently participate another study investigational drug ( medical device ) participate another clinical study investigational drug ( medical device ) within 30 day Study Day 1 , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect previous investigational drug ( whichever longer ) ; 2 . Known hypersensitivity component formulation study drug , bardoxolone methyl ; 3 . Any medical dental procedure , matter minor , plan anticipate occur conduct study ; 4 .

The investigator instruct subject participate study donate blood blood component 4 week completion study ; 7 . History unexplained syncope , cardiac arrest , unexplained cardiac arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes , structural heart disease , family history long QT syndrome ( suggest sudden death due cardiac cause young age close relative ) ; 8 . Evidence follow cardiac conduction abnormality base safety ECG Screening : Fridericia 's correction QT ( QTcF ) interval &gt; 450 m male , &gt; 470 ms female ; PR interval &lt; 110 m &gt; 240 m ; Intraventricular conduction delay QRS duration &gt; 120 m ; Resting heart rate &lt; 40 bpm &gt; 90 bpm ; Pathological Qwaves ( define Qwave &gt; 40 m depth &gt; 0.40.5 mV ) ; Second thirddegree atrioventricular block ( AVB ) ; Electrocardiographic evidence complete leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) , right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) , incomplete leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) ; Ventricular preexcitation ; Atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , artificial cardiac pacemaker ; 9 . Screening ECG render measurement QT interval lead II imprecise ( example : flat T wave , arrhythmia ) ; 10 . Subjects screen supine blood pressure ( BP ) outside 90−145 mm Hg systolic 45−95 mm Hg diastolic ( measure follow least 10minute rest ) . Blood pressure may retested twice supine position interval 5 minute . The pressure elevation consider sustain either systolic diastolic pressure exceed state limit three assessment subject may randomize ; 11 . Use concomitant medication know prolong QT/QTc interval within 30 day prior Study Day 1 ; 12 . Allergy moxifloxacin fluoroquinolone antibiotic ; 13 . A positive test drug ( ) abuse ( alcohol , amphetamine , benzodiazepine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , cannabinoids ) screen Day 2 visit ; 14 . Any concurrent clinical condition judgment investigator could either potentially pose health risk subject involve study could potentially influence study outcome ; 15 . Positive test result human immunodeficiency virus type 1 2 antibody screening ; 16 . Any condition possibly affect absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug may confound analysis conduct study ( example : previous surgery gastrointestinal tract include removal part stomach , bowel , liver , gall bladder , pancreas , venocaval shunt , transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ] ) ; 17 . Evidence history concurrent clinically significant allergic ( except untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose administration ) , hematological , endocrine , immunological , renal , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurological disease judgment investigator could potentially either pose health risk subject study influence study outcome ; 18 . Evidence hepatic biliary dysfunction include elevation total bilirubin , direct bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , alkaline phosphatase level great upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening ; 19 . Abnormal hematological biochemical parameter , include neutrophil count &lt; 1500 cells/mm3 , Hgb &lt; 11 g/dL female &lt; 12 g/dL male , platelet count &lt; 90,000 cells/mm3 , creatinine ≥ 1.5 X ULN , albumin ≤ 3 g/dL , serum amylase lipase ≥ 1.5X ULN screening ; 20 . Positive test result hepatitis B virus antibody , hepatitis C virus antibody screening ; 21 . Use need prescription nonprescription systemic drug ( ) include vitamin herbal preparation drug use contraception , aspirin , acetaminophen , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent , within 10 day Study Day 1 study ; 22 .
