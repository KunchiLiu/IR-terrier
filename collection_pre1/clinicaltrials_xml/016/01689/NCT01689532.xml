	<brief_title>A Study CNTO 136 ( Sirukumab ) Administered Subcutaneously Japanese Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Unresponsive Methotrexate Sulfasalazine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign treatment chance ) , double-blind ( study personnel patient know treatment give ) , multicenter study . The expected duration study 68 week . This include 52 week treatment study agent dose every 2 week 16 week safety follow-up last dose . Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) , include MTX SSZ , permit 4 week first dose study agent Week 24 . The use DMARDs discourage time Week 24 ; however , patient le 20 % improvement baseline swell tender joint count Week 24 allowed take DMARDs . At time Week 16 , initiation and/or adjustment oral corticosteroid allow patient less 20 % improvement baseline swell tender joint count Week 16 .</detailed_description>
