	<brief_summary>Musculoskeletal sprain/strain injury disorder ( MSID ) major impact health , quality life societal productivity . Early intervention pain follow acute MSIDs may prevent secondary complication chronic pain , disability , reduce quality life lose productivity . The investigator goal evaluate efficacy computer-based self-management intervention reduce pain improve function person treat on-site physical rehabilitation center . The specific aim are:1 ) evaluate efficacy computer-based self-management intervention reduce pain self-efficacy function high risk MSID patient ; 2 ) determine long term impact six month follow-up period ; 3 ) determine whether reduction pain improved function translate reduction lose work time day away work , restricted work day , worker 's compensation cost re-injury rate 6 month follow-up . Persons sprain/strain injury risk poor pain control randomize either : 1 ) control condition - standard care rehabilitation center plus computer exposure 2 ) standard care plus computer-based self-management pain intervention . Assessment baseline , treatment completion , 3 6 month . The primary outcome measure self-efficacy , pain physical/psychosocial functioning secondary outcome measure day away work , restricted work day worker 's compensation cost re-injury rate . The investigation also provide unique valuable information regard patient acceptance use computer-based intervention follow acute injury . By establish utility efficacy computer-based pain management intervention MSID investigator potential improve health quality life person injury , improve productivity develop new method health care delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study use 2 group randomize control clinical trial design . The two group : 1 ) standard care rehabilitation center control computer exposure ( SCCE ) 2 ) standard care plus computer-based self-management pain ( CBSM ) intervention . The study examine short- long-term effect intervention pain physical psychosocial functioning productivity ( DAW , RWD , WC cost re-injury ) 200 complete patient strain/sprain MSID . Outcome data collect baseline , treatment , 3 6 month follow-up . All outcome assessment administer computer . Pain Management Following Musculoskeletal Injury Study . The study comprise two phase : Phase I Planning/Development Phase II Intervention . During Phase I Planning/Development , study investigator 1 ) identify technology partner aid computerization intervention ; 2 ) identify site study implementation ; 3 ) develop consent form track procedure ; 4 ) develop computer base self-management ( CBSM ) pain intervention ; 5 ) develop computer base educational material control condition ; 6 ) beta test intervention material ; 7 ) develop recruitment material ; 8 ) develop outcome assessment procedure measure . During Phase II Intervention , study investigator 1 ) complete IRB review study sit ; 2 ) train study personnel , upon approval IRBs ; 3 ) initiation study subject recruitment intervention . Phase II begin June 2011 complete June 2013 . During Phase II total 200 patient enrol study . Control Group Individuals acute MSID , employers on-site rehabilitation center , initially see plant medical office , appropriate , refer rehabilitation service . Patients give initial evaluation treat physical occupational therapist treatment plan implement . The typical patient see average approximately 9 visit four-week period . However , patient see long indicated . SCCE see appropriate control condition several reason . First , deny patient care ethically appropriate . Second , type rehabilitation injury education care typically receive acute MSID patient current standard practice . Currently education provide write brochure handout . The addition computer interaction present education control threat related differential time spend treatment novelty computer supplement care . The computer exposure administer 8 session average 4-week period patient receive standard on-site rehabilitation care . Patients come center receive standard care interact computer 25-30 minute control condition . The primary goal condition provide control computer exposure . Briefly , first session concentrate establish patient 's ability interact computer . The material provide general education regard injury method prevent re-injury . This condition provide teach practice specific pain management cop management skill . This control computer education activity equalize computer exposure two group duration time devote injury care . Intervention Group : Will receive medical care physical therapy treatment control group . In addition computer-based self-management program ( CBSM ) intervention administer 8 session average 4 week period patient receive standard on-site rehabilitation care . Patients come center receive standard care interact computer 25-30 minute CBSM intervention . The primary goal treatment include develop skill manage acute injury relate pain include : reduce fear avoidance belief catastrophizing , improve mood , increase perception control self-efficacy , maintain activity reduce pain . The intervention material base investigator work self-management program person limb loss show effective secondary prevention study MSID , specifically Pain Disability Prevention Program ( PDPP ) develop Sullivan . While PDPP evaluate person work six week study target individual recently injure , content intervention appropriate study population . Each session focus specific topic set skill . Skills present model computer-based video session , audio use explain model teach skill relaxation training . This supplement write material minimize need reading . Patients instructed practice apply skill session . Patients also give specific feedback progress work CBSM module . As CBSM take place within on-site rehabilitation center , staff available provide assistance necessary . The session initially focus pain , primary motivator patient , expand focus cognitive emotional factor relate pain disability finally move increase activity . A home activity assign completion session . The home activity print patient take home available participant study website remote location . The study intervention home activity refine use focus group pilot test method .</detailed_description>
