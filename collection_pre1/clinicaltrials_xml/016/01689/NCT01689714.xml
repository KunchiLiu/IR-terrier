	<brief_summary>The folate receptor overexpressed many type cancer , include ovarian endometrial cancer , level folate receptor expression increase stage disease . Technetium Tc 99m EC20 ( 99mTc-EC20 ; FolateScan ) , folate-targeted diagnostic radiopharmaceutical , design bind folate receptor . Thus , FolateScan may provide effective method determine folate receptor-positive ( FR+ ) target tumor , thereby assist identification patient may benefit folate-targeted therapy .</brief_summary>
