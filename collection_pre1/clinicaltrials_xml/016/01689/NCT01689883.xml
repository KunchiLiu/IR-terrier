	<brief_summary>The overall objective study test whether use small electrical current stimulate proprioceptor upper limb result enhance benefit robotic-assisted therapy . The stimulation technique use `` Stochastic Resonance '' ( SR ) . In previous study , show SR effect increase afferent traffic Golgi tendon organ muscle spindle . This effect refer `` sensory enhancement '' . Also , SR show improve result physical therapy animal model . The study intend explore use SR stroke survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To establish procedure optimize delivery SR stimulation target organ . The investigator hypothesize optimal level stimulation individual lead high level sensory enhancement . The investigator determine level stimulation measure impact different stimulation level quality movement perform subject stimulate . Aim 2 : To gather preliminary evidence effectiveness SR stimulation stroke rehabilitation . The investigator plan combine optimal SR stimulation , determine Aim 1 , robotic-assisted rehabilitation perform preliminary assessment size improvement associate delivery SR stimulation . The investigator hypothesize robotic-assisted rehabilitation combination SR stimulation proprioceptor lead large motor gain robotic-assisted rehabilitation alone .</detailed_description>
