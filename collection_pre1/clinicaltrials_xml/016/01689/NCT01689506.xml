	<brief_title>Fluid Resuscitation Patients Suffering From Burns Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe burn injury present unique resuscitation problem due simultaneous loss electrolyte protein-rich exudate burn wound leakage fluid protein circulation interstitial compartment . In post shock phase burn resuscitation , patient frequently suffer oedema unburned tissue organ positive fluid balance many litre . This pilot study compare two burn fluid resuscitation regime ( supplementation 6 % HES 130/0.4 isotonic electrolyte solution , Volulyte 6 % , versus supplementation Human Serum Albumin , HSA 50g/L ) patient outcome particular regard fluid balance 24 hour burns injury ( primary variable ) .</detailed_description>
