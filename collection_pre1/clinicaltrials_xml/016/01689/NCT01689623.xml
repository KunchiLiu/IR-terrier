	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between TMC435 , Atorvastatin Simvastatin Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , 2-panel , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) study healthy participant investigate pharmacokinetic interaction TMC435 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin simvastatin . The study consist screen period ( 21 day prior first intake study medication ) , 17-day treatment period 5-7 day follow-up period . Approximately thirty six healthy participant equally divide 2 panel ( n=18 per panel ) . Within panel participant receive treatment order . In Panel 1 , participant administer single oral 40-mg atorvastatin dose Day 1 Day 13 . The participant receive TMC435 dose 150 mg daily Day 4 Day 15 . In Panel 2 , participant administer single oral 40-mg simvastatin dose Day 1 Day 13 . TMC435 dose 150 mg administered daily Day 4 Day 15 . Treatment duration ( include Day -1 ) 17 day panel ( Panel 1 Panel 2 ) . Safety tolerability evaluate throughout study .</detailed_description>
