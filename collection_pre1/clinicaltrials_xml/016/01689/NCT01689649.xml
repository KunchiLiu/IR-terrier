	<brief_title>A Study Assess Tolerability Efficacy Topiramate Monotherapy Recently Diagnosed Patients With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label ( people know identity intervention ) , dose optimization trial ass tolerability efficacy topiramate monotherapy recently ( within 5 year ) diagnose patient epilepsy . Treatment naive patient ( patient never receive treatment ) patient fail first AED monotherapy allow . Failure define lack efficacy and/or tolerability AED reason failure record physician . A lack efficacy characterize patient treat AED target dose patient still seizure . Topiramate first titrate initial target dose reach 4-6 week . Further dose titration guide clinical response individual patient , dose may exceed maximum 400mg/day [ 9mg/kg/day child ] . If patient us AED entry , AED fully taper period 3 week , start begin week 2 , order patient topiramate monotherapy visit 3 . Tapering AED may , however , extend 3-week period clinically indicate . Visits perform baseline 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 week . The total duration patient study 4 month .</detailed_description>
