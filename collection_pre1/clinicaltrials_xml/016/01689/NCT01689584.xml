	<detailed_description>The BRCA1 BRCA2 gene two major high-risk breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility gene . Monoallelic germline mutation disrupt normal gene function significantly increase risk develop cancer carrier . The identification causal mutation proband allow propose pre-symptomatic test causal mutation at-risk relative . Currently , causal mutation , use genetic counseling , present approximatively 13 % family test . Variants unknown biological significance ( VUS ) detect 20 % proband test . For family probands , genetic testing could propose relative genetic counseling guide family history epidemiological knowledge exclusively . The French UMD-BRCA1/2 database , accredit French National Cancer Institute , collect anonymous result genetic test perform authorized French laboratory since 1995 , give real-time vision family carry VUS . In september 2011 , French UMD-BRCA1/2 database comprise 706 different variant 1,300 BRCA1 family 1,089 different variant 2,101 BRCA2 family . One key measurable parameter classification VUS causal mutation co-segregation disease . As average size French family relatively small , information variant co-segregation limit one family would significant . However , compilation co-segregation result obtain several family allow obtain precise complete estimation probability causality give variant . The objective COVAR study ( COsegregation VARiants ) organize co-segregation study VUS database UMD-BRCA1/2 , order determine causal non-causal nature variant . To organize variant clinical relevance , grid 5 class use : 1=neutral , 2=likely neutral , 3=VUS , 4=likely causal , 5=causal . The VUS class 3 4 candidate co-segregation study use genetic counseling . In selected family index case invite family member ( affected unaffected ) provide sample salivary fluid test presence VUS . The probability VUS causal calculate cosegregation data use Bayesian model . The result integrate multifactorial model describe D. Goldgar , model integrate different parameter amino acid conservation , structural impact variant , co-occurrence pathogenic mutation , family history tumor characteristic .</detailed_description>
