	<detailed_description>Terminal chronic renal failure ( ESRD ) result almost chronic kidney disease develop due progressive loss nephron . This state characterize gradual deterioration functional ability kidney , also whole body . Currently , ESRD among first ten cause mortality . Transplantation donor organ radical treatment various disease terminal , patient fatal prognosis . Kidney transplantation allow save life , also return normal life , tens thousand people . Survival renal transplant recipient grow . Despite progress make many clinic worldwide recent year field transplantation , kidney transplantation , settle problem reperfusion injury associate post-transplant dysfunction absence clear indicator morphological , clinical , biochemical instrumental method assess functional reserve organ remain relevant meaningful .</detailed_description>
