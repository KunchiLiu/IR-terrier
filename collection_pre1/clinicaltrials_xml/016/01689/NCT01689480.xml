	<brief_summary>It accept physical activity deleterious myopathy , include muscular dystrophy . In patient suffer facioscapulohumeral dystrophy ( FSHD ) , aerobic training report associated physiological functional positive effect without alteration quality life . Van der Kooi et al . ( 2005 ) Cup et al . ( 2007 ) study suggest combination endurance strength training even relevant . However , control randomized study conduct topic impact training program skeletal muscle regenerative capacity address yet . Moreover , due fact train program mainly perform short-term supervised period , lack knowledge regard long-term effect , patient 's autonomy whether practice regular exercise maintain patient 's daily life . Also , experiment report integrative view potential benefit program functional , biological quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study 24-months Physical Training Introduced Lifestyle Patients With FSHD : Tolerance , Sustainability Efficiency Unsupervised Training Program .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present project second phase study first phase currently finance AFM progress aim establish program adapt physical training perform patient 's home supervision . This program develop order try meet two follow requirement : 1 ) compatible daily professional/social activity patient integrated life routine ; 2 ) intense enough functional benefit induce . The first phase control randomize study patient FSHD participate 6-months supervised train program combining aerobic strength training session ergocycle . This second phase research project aim evaluate whether long-term integration adapt train program patient ' lifestyle possible . The tool , method measurement train program use remote monitoring , less frequent first phase , period 24 month . This second experimental work also base multi-factorial evaluation , i.e . biological , physiological , functional , quality life questionnaire remain collaboration Universities Saint Etienne ( L. Féasson ) , Grenoble ( B Wuyam ) Örebro ( F Kadi ) within Rhône-Alpes Reference Centre Rare Neuromuscular Diseases ( JC Antoine ) .</detailed_description>
