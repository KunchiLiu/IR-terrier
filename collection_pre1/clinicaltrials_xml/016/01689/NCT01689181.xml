	<brief_summary>Apathy , define quantitative reduction voluntary , goal-directed behaviour ( GDB ) , core component negative symptom . It suggest physiopathology apathy single entity may multiple , depend specific process macrofunction disrupt completion GDB . In line notion , Levy Dubois propose divide apathic syndrome three subtypes disrupt processing : ' a-motivation ' , 'cognitive inertia ' , 'uncoupling ' . In schizophrenia , apathy associate executive dysfunction , functional impairment poor outcome . However , neurobiological underpinnings apathy schizophrenia poorly understood . Primary objective : confirm chronic schizophrenic patient apathic compare healthy volunteer Secondary objective : - investigate apathy relate particular aspect disease ( i.e . negative , positive symptomatology and/or deficit form ) - investigate apathy correlate executive dysfunction - investigate apathy associate specific mechanism use experimental task specially design investigate different mechanism ( i.e . ' a-motivation ' , 'cognitive inertia ' , 'uncoupling ' ) - investigate volumetric abnormality affect executive system apathic schizophrenic patient - link eventual volumetric abnormality prefrontal cortex-basal ganglion circuit accord specific subtype apathy apathic schizophrenic group</brief_summary>
