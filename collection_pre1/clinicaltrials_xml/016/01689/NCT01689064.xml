	<brief_title>Comparison Surgical Approach Endoscopic Pituitary Adenoma Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pituitary adenoma 's represent 10 25 % central nervous system ( CNS ) neoplasms estimate population prevalence 94 per 100,000 . Asymptomatic adenoma go largely undetected since screen protocol implement purpose early identification . Asymptomatic adenoma detect incidentally CNS image indication approximately 10 % study rarely require surgical intervention . In 2011 , Endocrine Society publish practice guideline management pituitary incidentalomas provide surgical indication . Incidental microadenoma 's ( &lt; 10 mm ) rarely need surgical intervention , however , incidental macroadenoma 's ( &gt; 10 mm ) often required surgical resection due proximity optic nerve chiasm . Most symptomatic pituitary adenoma require transnasal transsphenoid surgical resection . Due potential hormone secretion location vital structure optic chiasm/nerves , carotid artery , cavernous sinus , management symptomatic pituitary adenoma often require multi-disciplinary team involve neurosurgery , otolaryngology , neuroophthalmology , endocrinology . Traditionally microscope use visualization pituitary tumor surgery , however recent technologic advance , endoscopic approach largely replace microscopic approach . A recent systematic review meta-analysis compare microscopic endoscopic approach demonstrate endoscopic approach result significant reduction rate cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) leak , improve tumor resection , improve patient comfort , reduce hospital length stay . Furthermore , endoscopic approach appear provide overall cost saving compare microscopic approach . Several recent study demonstrate endoscopic approach pituitary adenoma resection result improve disease-specific quality life ( QoL ) general QoL . All study utilize posterior septectomy approach involve remove posterior nasal septum create common posterior nasal cavity . The open posterior nasal cavity provide excellent surgical access sphenoid sinus pituitary gland . Disadvantages posterior septectomy approach include permanent posterior septal perforation may predispose postoperative crusting epistaxis . A recent article Stamm et al . describe novel endoscopic approach whereby posterior septal mucosa preserve still provide excellent access sphenoid . The primary advantage approach prevent posterior septal defect , however disadvantage include challenge technique potential reduce surgical visualization . Furthermore , still risk septal perforation due intraoperative trauma significant postoperative crusting often develop along surface heal septal mucosa . Both endoscopic approach inherent advantage disadvantage study compare approach . Surgeons perform endoscopic pituitary tumor resection utilize approach neither consider standard care . The purpose randomized , single-blinded study determine clinical outcome posterior septectomy Stamm approach endoscopic pituitary adenoma resection . We hypothesize difference disease-specific QoL general QoL two surgical approach .</detailed_description>
