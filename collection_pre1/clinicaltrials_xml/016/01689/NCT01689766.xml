	<brief_title>Study Using FolateScan Identify Subjects With Folate Receptor-Positive Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational new drug ( FolateScan Technetium Tc 99m EC20 ) folate-targeted diagnostic radiopharmaceutical agent design bind folate receptor . The folate receptor glycoprotein over-expressed many type cancer cell minimally distribute normal tissue . Folate conjugate bind folate receptor high affinity bring cell via endocytosis . In contrast , folic acid enters normal cell via reduced folate carrier , pathway entirely inaccessible folate conjugate . Therefore , folate conjugate specific cancer cell . This phase 2 , multi-center , open-label , single-treatment group , baseline-controlled study design verify product safety , gather data percentage metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient increase uptake FolateScan tumor , calculate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive predictive value , negative predictive value FolateScan compare immunohistochemical staining ( IHC ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible study , patient must fulfill follow criterion : 1 . Patient must 18 year age old . 2 . Patient must suspect metastatic renal cell carcinoma least one identifiable lesion &gt; 2.0 cm diagnose CT , MRI , ultrasonography within 60 day prior enrollment . 3 . Patient must good kidney function define serum creatinine â‰¤1.5 X ULN . 4 . Patient must provide write informed consent prior enrollment . 5 . Patients must provide formalinfixed , paraffinembedded tissue sample either primary metastatic recurrent site ( ) IHC stain presence folate receptor either previous surgical/biopsy procedure surgery/biopsy schedule within 30 day FolateScan . A fine needle aspirate acceptable . Any following criterion make patient ineligible participate study : 1 . Patient pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Patient simultaneously participate another investigational drug study , exclude followup phase . 3 . Patient receive investigational agent therapeutic chemotherapy within 7 day prior enrollment . 4 . Patient unable tolerate condition radionuclide image . 5 . Patient administer another radiopharmaceutical would interfere assessment Technetium Tc 99m EC20 .</criteria>
