	<brief_summary>This research study aim compare different method help difficult treat scarring ( cystic ) acne , ALA-PDT i-PDT . There investigational procedure call photodynamic therapy ( ALA-PDT ) report efficient acne treatment since 2000 . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use drug call ALA ( aminolevulinic acid ) , market Levulan® . Levulan® apply directly facial/back acne . This way usually apply . Levulan® leave skin three hour skin absorb . Next , skin Levulan® apply expose red light activation . The sebaceous gland get obstruct inflamed cause acne . ALA get skin skin pore gland .

Some side effect include pain , burn sensation procedure , redness , tenderness , swell procedure . At Massachusetts General Hospital 's Wellman Center Photomedicine , investigator develop another procedure call inhibitory-PDT ( i-PDT ) similar ALA-PDT . i-PDT aim reduce side-effects ALA- PDT . The difference two procedure i-PDT us light source prevent Levulan® accumulation normal skin surface . The investigator would like find Levulan® place inside sebaceous gland .</brief_summary>
