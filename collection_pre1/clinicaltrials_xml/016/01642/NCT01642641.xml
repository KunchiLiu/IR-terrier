	<brief_title>Different Surgical Modalities Treatment Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease ( PD ) highly prevalent chronic disease , may associate loss gum bone tissue surround tooth . Among adult ( 2 teeth remain ) England , 54 % experienced gum bleed 45 % periodontal ( gum ) disease 9 % severe . Bacterial origin , high prevalence PD , together increase retention teeth old age , considerable implication population 's future treatment need associate cost health system . It therefore important ensure intervention deliver proven efficient cost effective . The investigator study question therefore , `` In adult population moderate severe chronic periodontitis , 3 different treatment approach ; simplify papilla preservation flap ( SPPF ) , resective periodontal flap osseous recontouring ( RPFO ) subgingival debridement ( SD ) , differ regard heal resolution disease , patient report outcome cost effectiveness ? '' The aim study find efficient way treat chronic periodontitis , randomise control trial 3 establish form treatment . Research carry Eastman Dental Institute Hospital , specifically Eastman Clinical Investigation Centre ( ECIC ) , dedicated clinical research centre . A total 87 participant recruit order provide necessary power discriminate 3 treatment approach . Eligible patient , fit inclusion criterion , draw hospital referral inform consent gain , randomise one 3 approach . Two surgical approach ( SPPF , RPFO ) compare non-surgical ( SD ) approach , follow 12 month period . Among thing , investigator compare clinical parameter wound heal ( include bacterial change ) , patient 's quality life cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
