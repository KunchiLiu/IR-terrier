	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Determine safe high dose study drug RAD001 ( Everolimus ) take combination hormonal radiation therapy men high risk prostate cancer . - Evaluate change patient report quality life - Evaluate biomarkers prostate tumor sample . Biomarkers various trait use identify progress disease condition , help researcher determine effect study treatment tumor . Biomarkers also help determine area research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Everolimus Added Combined Hormonal Radiation Therapy High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer prevalent estimate &gt; 200,000 new case &gt; 25,000 death attributable prostate cancer United States 2010 . Radiation treatment represent commonly utilized method treat prostate cancer excellent chance control disease biochemical control 5-years excess 75 % men locally confine intermediate high-risk disease . However , despite impressive biochemical control , local control remain problem . Everolimus investigate anticancer agent base potential act : - Directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation - Indirectly inhibit angiogenesis lead reduced tumor vascularity . Given prevalence PTEN deletion high-risk prostate cancer well evidence tumor hypoxia lead increase risk failure treatment hormonal therapy radiation , hypothesis inhibition mTOR signal tumor vascular cell use everolimus concurrent hormonal radiation therapy enhance efficacy radiation therapy without unacceptable risk toxicity men high-risk prostate cancer . Everolimus approve FDA treatment prostate cancer combination radiation hormonal therapy . It known combination safe effective prostate cancer . The FDA allow combine use clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 year Participants must able care Adequate function Adequate kidney function Histologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate biopsy within 90 day enrollment Highrisk prostate cancer No distant metastasis evaluate bone scan CT pelvis ( within 90 day enrollment ) Participants must least 4 biopsy core contain prostate cancer tissue available histologic analysis Signed inform consent Participants currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , target therapy , etc . ) Prior pharmacologic androgen ablation prostate cancer allow include LHRH agonist therapy oral antiandrogen therapy . Previous use either finasteride dutasteride allow Participants , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , participant recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) participant may require major surgery course study Any previous therapeutic radiation therapy pelvis . Known gastrointestinal dysfunction inability take oral medication would preclude take oral medication . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week registration Participants receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Participants receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week registration study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Participants severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia The use antiarrhythmic medication implant pacemaker defibrillator allow would exclude patient enrollment . Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function Uncontrolled diabetes Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection Liver disease cirrhosis severe hepatic impairment Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary ; A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening participant . Participants previous document history Hepatitis B/C infection exclude enrollment . Participants high risk hepatitis base upon medical history risk factor must screen Hepatitis B C , positive exclude enrollment . A known history HIV seropositivity Participants active , bleed diathesis Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) woman child bear potential willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment Participants receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Sirolimus elute coronary artery stent allow Participants know hypersensitivity everolimus rapamycins ( e.g. , sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients Participants unwilling unable comply protocol</criteria>
