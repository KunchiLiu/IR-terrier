	<brief_summary>Higher rate mortality find short sleeper ( &lt; 6 hr/night ) long sleeper ( &gt; 8 hr/night ) , little experimental investigation effect chronic , moderate sleep loss long average sleeper . Some scientist argue old adult might particularly vulnerable negative effect sleep loss , whereas scientist argue many old adult spend much time bed , moderate reduction time-in-bed could help increase quality sleep , could even promote health longevity , particularly long sleeper . At 4 site across US , conduct large ( 200 people ) , randomize , control , 5- year study examine whether 1-hour reduction time spend bed 12 week negative positive effect multiple health-related outcome , include inflammation , sleepiness , body weight , mood , glucose regulation , quality life , incidence illness , incidence automobile accident older long sleeper compare old average sleeper .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Moderate Sleep Restriction Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic study consistently show self -reported sleep duration &lt; 7 hr &gt; 8 hr associate increased mortality morbidity . The risk associate short sleep consistent vast experimental literature indicate detrimental effect profound sleep restriction . However , little study chronic moderate sleep restriction , far common , thus important public health standpoint . The risk associate long sleep scarcely experimentally examine , though epidemiological data suggest sleep restriction might promote health/longevity long sleeper . Older adult might vulnerable young adult negative effect sleep impairment , perhaps particularly via inflammatory mechanism . Negative effect might least evident long sleeper average sleeper long sleep reflect underlying morbidity , many posit . On hand , old adult might tolerate ( benefit ) moderate sleep restriction . Older adult often tend spend excessive time bed ( TIB ) , particularly long sleeper , extra TIB could contribute age-related sleep fragmentation morbidity , could ameliorate modest TIB restriction . The aim study : ( 1 ) examine ability old long sleeper older average sleeper adhere 60 min TIB restriction ; ( 2 ) contrast effect 12 week 60 min TIB restriction health-related measure old long vs. average sleeper . One hundred old adult ( age 60-80 yr ) report sleep 8-9 hr per night 100 adult age range report sleep 6-7.25 hr per night examine 4 experimental site 5 year . Following 2-week baseline , participant randomly assign one two 12-week treatment group . ( 1 ) A sleep restriction group ( n=60 long sleeper n=60 average sleeper ) assign fix sleep- wake schedule , time bed reduce precisely 60 min participant 's baseline time bed ( TIB ) . ( 2 ) A control group ( n=40 long sleeper n=40 average sleeper ) sleep restriction , also follow fix sleep schedule . Sleep assess continuously actigraphy daily diary . Questionnaires answered . Measures include body weight , glucose tolerance , sleepiness , depression , quality life , psychomotor vigilance , incidence automobile accident , incidence illness , multiple marker inflammation . Physical exams week 2 6 intervention study ombudsman monitor potential adverse effect . Follow-up assessment conduct 12 month . The proposed clinical trial provide comprehensive Phase 1 assessment risk benefit chronic moderate TIB restriction ever conduct .</detailed_description>
