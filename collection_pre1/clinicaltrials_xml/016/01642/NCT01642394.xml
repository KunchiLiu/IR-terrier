	<brief_summary>Main objective : To evaluate effectiveness `` Diabetes Self-Management Programme '' ( DSMP ) metabolic control , cardiovascular risk reduction , quality life self-efficacy adult patient type 2 diabetes , compare current standard care patient type 2 diabetes , context Osakidetza 's Primary Care network . Secondary objective : - To evaluate impact implementation DSMP use health service . - To assess impact DSMP cost treatment involve population . - To evaluate improvement physical activity diet pattern among participant . - To describe feasibility implement DSMP Basque Country 's primary health care system Methodology : Randomized clinical trial patient diagnose type 2 diabetes age 18 80 year pertain 4 primary region Basque country , agree participate study , randomly assign two group : intervention group ( DSMP programme ) control group . The intervention perform trained patient type 2 diabetes health professional consist 6 group session two half hour , weekly basis overall duration 6 week . The session content include technique deal problem , promotion exercise , nutrition concept , proper use medication , effective communication basic knowledge diabetes complication . The session support educational material . The main outcome improvement HbA1c ( glycated hemoglobin ) level . Secondary outcome reduction cardiovascular risk , increase quality life self-efficacy . The result analyze 6 , 12 24 month intervention . Hypothesis : An educational intervention patient type 2 diabetes mellitus base program DSMP conduct previously train lay person health professional , improve metabolic control measure 0.5 % decrease Hb A1c ( Clar , 2010 ) , compare regular health education . On hand , expect see improvement quality life patient . The intervention may reduce weight cardiovascular risk due change physical activity diet pattern , get appropriate use health service medication . It expect change variable occur 6 month intervention remain time</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The management chronic disease ( CD ) challenge health service . The health system must provide efficient coordinate care people CD aim reduce decompensation improve quality life patient his/her family . In task , primary care ( PC ) play key role ( Bengoa , 2008 ) . The good living condition current development health care produce demographic shift population , result increased life expectancy therefore prevalence CD . In Basque Country ( BC ) , population 65 increased recent year 25 % ( EUSTAT 2005 ) . According BC Health Survey 2007 , prevalence CD increase community 83.5 % men 86.1 % woman 65 chronic disease ( Arcelay , 2009 ) . In health system , 80 % primary care consultation cause CD , represent 60 % hospital admission 70 % health spending ( Bengoa , 2008 ) . The incidence diabetes mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) BC also increase recent year . Currently , estimate prevalence DM2 may 12 % people 30 year . An evaluation diabetic population coverage primary care record estimate 4 % diabetic population remain undiagnosed . Cardiovascular morbidity mortality people DM2 high general population . The mortality rate diabetes 13 30 death per 100,000 people per year . 75 % patient diabetes die due cardiovascular disease , especially coronary heart disease . Between 6.3 % 7.4 % spending health care system deem caused diabetes . Self-promotion paramount importance diabetes care ( diabetes Strategy National Health System , 2007 ) . It estimate 42 % diabetic community obese , 79.6 % hypertensive 22 % diabetic macroangiopathy ( Arteagoitia , 2003 ) . The control diabetes country , accord late assessment preferential offer BC , improve . 44 % well-controlled diabetic patient , i.e . A1 Hb le 7 % , 25 % blood pressure ( BP ) 140/90 . These data contrast obtain final report GEDAPS ( Red Group Study Diabetes Primary Health Care , 2010 ) cover year 2007 , figure 59 % HbA1c 65,1 % BP . One proposal , raise group GEDAPS improve control patient , increase educational activity patient . As developed country , health system Spain complete cycle require new organizational model meet challenge chronic patient care ( Department Health Basque Government , 2010 ) . There different proposal meet challenge . Among developed evaluate , find model manage chronic disease ( Chronic Care Model ) Pyramid Model Risk ( Bengoa , 2008 ) . In program , self-care education involve subject 's participation management disease critical role . To achieve change management chronic disease , several health administration suggest self-management education program non-professionals . The widely use structure approach , great evidence effectiveness , Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ( CDSMP ) Stanford University , implement 12 country , include UK´s Expert Patient Programme , Australia´s Partners Health Canada 's Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme . The CDSMP base self-efficacy theory Albert Bandura , social cognitive theory , state key predictor successful change behaviour confidence ( self-efficacy ) ability perform action prospect achieve particular goal ( expect outcome ) . Self-efficacy consider first step causal pathways behavior change self-care programme . Increased self-efficacy prerequisite behaviour change improvement treatment chronic disease , result low demand health care ( Foster , 2007 ) . The CDSMP design Stanford University California . It develop evaluate 20 year , randomize control trial ( Gordon , 2008 ) . The first program `` Course arthritis self-management '' later become prototype following course self-management . They develop specific self-management course diabetes , `` Diabetes Self-Management Programme ( DSMP ) '' , Spanish version call `` Manejo Personal de la Diabetes ( MPD ) '' Each patient train structured course , complete personal action plan design take control life chronic illness . The mission leader , two course , assist patient problem solving , decision make self-efficacy . Leaders usually non-professionals one chronic disease , caregiver chronic patient could act leader well Education non-professionals differs education provide professional : - Commonly live chronic illness act role model participant . - The format less formal order promote discussion way self care participant consider useful , might feel able discuss program run professional . - Lay leader , especially certain ethnic group , provide subtle important interpretation health advice . Research Question Is self-management education programme teach non-professionals ( DSMP ) type 2 diabetes live Basque Country effective regular health education , evaluate term improvement HbA1c , quality life , self-efficacy , cost clinical variable ( BP , cardiovascular risk , BMI , etc ) Justification novelty question , expect progress beyond currently know . Many systematic review ( SR ) effectiveness model publish ( Foster , 2007 ) ( Gordon , 2008 ) ( Bury , 2005 ) . RS conduct Chodosh ( Chodosh et al. , 2005 ) , limited old people , find benefit outcome variable ( blood pressure glycosylated hemoglobin ) diseases diabetes hypertension osteoarthritis . The Cochrane 's SR ( Foster , 2007 ) evaluate 17 clinical trial ( EK ) , none take place environment , include reference appear report NICE ( Bury , 2005 ) . Seven study CDSMP . The disease include arthritis , diabetes , hypertension chronic pain . Their conclusion differ Chodosh 's , Cochrane 's SR obtain small significant difference self-rated health , aerobic physical exercise cognitive treatment symptom evidence variable psychological health , quality life number visit general practitioner . In Spain , Andalucía ( Andalusian School Public Health ) Catalonia ( Catalan Health Institute ) experience chronic disease programme follow model . Both case preliminary favourable result . However , evaluate prospectively neither compare usual care structure program ( Gonzalez Mestre , 2009 ) A recent study , perform another health care set ( male veteran U.S. ) , show educational intervention conduct patient effective glycemic control educational intervention conduct nurse ( Heisler , 2010 ) . Another recently publish study conduct primary care Ireland use also patient show effective patient type 2 diabetes . The program use Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme ( CDSMP ) ( Smith , 2011 ) . Although educational group intervention health care professional proven effectiveness ( Deakin , 2008 ) , regular practice Osakidetza 's Primary Care In summary , conclude literature review : - There assessment prospective control study intervention system . - The heterogeneity outcomes intervention fact , due different lengths study , type intervention population . - There long-term assessment effectiveness model . - There under-representation child men . Publications evaluate model suggest follow research area : - Patient-centered evaluation clinical outcome . - Design-studies evaluate use health service . - Cost-effectiveness study . - Influence different component intervention outcomes . - Qualitative research way participant experience intervention . Given discrepancy finding various publication , NHS , lack research country , reaffirm need research system . Feasibility question The health department BC support new management strategy chronic patient accord Chronic Care Model ( http : //cronicidad.euskadi.net ) . One cornerstones model promotion self-care education population . Following idea , strategy want promote `` Active Patient Programme `` . This programme base CDSMP DSMP . DM2 chronic disease whose management currently carry community Primary Care ( PC ) nursing always fundamental role . PC professional community broad experience clinical management diabetes individual patient education treatment prevent long term complication . Nursing added motivation , one strategic line current health department involvement group new way manage chronic illness . Nurses likely accept program promote new role . On hand , implement programme require expensive new material resource complicate infrastructure . These program may conduct within daily activity health facility although may necessary use venue outside health system cultural center , neighbourhood association , etc… One strengths program simplicity implementation . The program design lead patient , specific train receive standardize material support , capable direct group . These patient people chronic illness , voluntarily offer help patient learn self manage disease .</detailed_description>
