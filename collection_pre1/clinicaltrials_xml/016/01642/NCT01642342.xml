	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) sEphB4-HSA . II . To describe dose limit toxicity adverse event profile sEphB4-HSA patient advance solid tumor . III . To describe pharmacokinetics sEphB4-HSA . IV . To describe anti-tumor activity sEphB4-HSA manifest response treatment . V. To obtain preliminary evaluation effect sEphB4-HSA absolute circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) number compare pre-treatment level use pre- treatment CTC . Exploratory evaluation effect sEphB4-HSA downstream protein mediator Ephrin pathway ( pAKT , pSrc ) transcriptional target gene ( rgs5 psenen ) perform . VI . To collect pilot information identify dose dose biologic activity . Biologic activity treatment sEphB4-HSA define evidence drug-on-target effect manifest reduction absolute CTC number . Other exploratory evaluation drug-on-target effect increase transcript level psenen rgs5 may consider assessment biologic activity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute one follow treatment schedule : 1 . Weekly treatment - administer day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . 2 . Every 2 week treatment - administer day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . 3 . Every 3 week treatment - administer day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
