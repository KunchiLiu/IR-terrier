	<detailed_description>Study Objective The primary objective study report feasibility accordance methodology describe Lancaster Dodds , specifically address : 1. baseline survival rate treatment control group aid design definitive multicentre trial . 2. randomization compliance rate . 3. ease protocol implementation out-of-hospital setting . 4. adverse rate Hypertonic Saline Dextran ( HSD ) infusion . The secondary objective include measure effect HSD modulate immuno-inflammatory response severe head injury effect modulate release neuro-biomarkers serum ; evaluate role serum neuro-biomarkers predict patient outcome clinical response HSD intervention ; evaluate effect HSD brain atrophy post-injury neurocognitive neuropsychological outcome .</detailed_description>
