	<brief_summary>There effective standard treatment fibrolamellar liver cancer remove surgery . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad , 3 drug call letrozole , leuprolide everolimus cancer . All drug FDA approve treatment different cancer . Letrozole leuprolide stop body produce estrogen , normal hormone produce body . Too much estrogen may help fibrolamellar liver cancer grow . Everolimus drug may block chemical body help cancer grow . The combination letrozole leuprolide plus everolimus may work well together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ( 1 ) Everolimus , ( 2 ) Estrogen Deprivation Therapy ( EDT ) With Leuprolide + Letrozole ( 3 ) Everolimus + EDT Patients With Unresectable Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( FLL-HCC )</brief_title>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 12 year old . Pathologically confirm diagnosis advance and/or unresectable FLLHCC . This perform participate center submit specimen . If submit material insufficient analysis , repeat biopsy recommend . ECOG performance status 02 ; Lansky performance score ≥ 60 % patient 1216 year old Adequate hematologic , renal hepatic function define : Hematologic : ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L , platelet ≥ 50 x 10^9/L Renal : creatinine ≤ 2 x upper limit normal , creatinine Clearance ≥60 cc/mL/1.73 m^2 patient &gt; 16 year old . For patient ≤ 16 year age , creatinine Clearance ≥70 cc/mL/1.73 m^2 serum creatinine base follow chart : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70ml/min/1.73 m^2 serum creatinine base age/gender follow : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) Male Female 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 year 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine value Table derive Schwartz formula estimate GFR ( Schwartz et al . J. Peds , 106:522 , 1985 ) utilize child length stature data publish CDC . Hepatic : total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL , alanine aminotransferase level ≤ 5 x upper limit normal age . Fasting blood glucose &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal . If fast glucose &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal , adequate glycemic control ( fast glucose &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ) three week recommend start protocol therapy . At least 1 target lesion measurable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) guideline . Target lesion ( ) must lie within previously resect , irradiate , ablate , chemoembolized area . If lesion lie area , must evidence ≥ 20 % increase diameter and/or appearance new lesion subsequent image order lesion consider target lesion . Prior systemic therapy allow . Prior surgery , locoregional ablative embolic therapy also permit provided criterion measurable disease outline meet . Concurrent antiviral therapy hepatitis B permit Women childbearing potential must practice effective method birth control may include intrauterine device ( hormonal nonhormonal acceptable ) , doublebarrier method , male partner sterilization abstinence , enrollment , throughout study 6 month receive last dose study drug . Men must agree use double barrier method birth control donate sperm study 6 month receive last dose study drug . Sperm banking acceptable interested male patient enrol study prior initiate treatment . Prescription oral contraceptive , contraceptive injection , contraceptive patch approve method contraception study . Negative pregnancy test ( serum hCG ) result ( applicable woman child bear potential ) within 7 day Cycle 1 Day 1 study treatment . Concurrent anticancer , radiation therapy . Patients must complete anticancer therapy &gt; 4 week start study therapy . The date last palliative radiation must &gt; 2 week start study therapy . Palliative radiation permit protocol MSK PI discretion treatment modification . Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Concurrent oral contraceptive use hormonal replacement therapy . Use aromatase inhibitor , GnRH agonist and/or tamoxifen within past 30 day . Patients previously fulvestrant q3 month GnRH agonist must discontinue medication least 3 month . Concurrent use potent CYP3A4 and/or Pglycoprotein inhibitor potent CYP3A4 inducer ( please see Appendices 3 4 ) . Where possible , otherwise eligible patient switch alternative agent ; otherwise , exclude study . Potent CYP3A4 inducer decrease serum everolimus level give concomitantly . Dose modification everolimus indicate presence moderate CYP3A4 inducer [ 108 ] . Please refer Appendix 3 complete list potent moderate inducer CYP3A4 . Potent CYP3A4 and/or Pglycoprotein inhibitor increase serum level everolimus coadministered . Moderate inhibitor may mildlymoderately increase serum everolimus level , though definitive evidence support dose reduction [ 108 ] . Please refer Appendix 4 complete list potent moderate inhibitor CYP3A4 . Any investigational drug receive within one month study enrollment . Any severe , uncontrolled medical condition , opinion investigator , may exacerbate study therapy include infection , diabetes cardiopulmonary disease . Any psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant nursing woman . Patients know hypersensitivity everolimus , letrozole , leuprolide and/or related compound excipients . Patients receive form transplant form immunosuppressive therapy . However transplanted patient immunosuppressive therapy least 4 week allow study , provide immunosuppressiverelated toxicity recover least grade 1 . Known HIV positive CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 . Immunization live vaccine &lt; 1 week initiate study therapy therapy . BSA &lt; 1 m^2</criteria>
