	<detailed_description>Background : Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) infusion one several novel approach decrease antibody level highly sensitize kidney transplant candidate [ 1 , 2 ] . This approach potentially give chance kidney transplantation end-stage renal failure patient could never receive transplantation high level antibody persistent positive crossmatches potential kidney donor . Many transplant center use strategy order increase transplant rate highly sensitized patient various level anti-HLA antibody . However , response treatment seem different patient factor affect treatment outcome yet determine .</detailed_description>
