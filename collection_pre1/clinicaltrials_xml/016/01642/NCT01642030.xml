	<brief_title>Study Treatment Experimental Pain Opioid Dependent Persons Methadone Buprenorphine Maintenance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do learn good treat pain people maintain opioid medication , like methadone buprenorphine ( Suboxone ® , Subutex ® ) . People take opioid medication long period time know experience pain differently ; , regular amount medication may enough treat pain individual . Additionally , many people history addiction afraid take opioid pain reliever , like morphine hydromorphone ( Dilaudid ® ) , fear relapse . This study help guide medical community well pain treatment people prescribe buprenorphine methadone . Investigators also want determine risk relapse people receive opioid pain reliever treatment acute pain . Healthy people age 18-55 maintained buprenorphine methadone treatment opioid dependence may take part study . Participants must free illicit drug use stable dose methadone buprenorphine . Initial screen occur phone select participant schedule in-person screening BPRU . If participant meet criteria agrees participate , enrol study . Enrolled participant 2 3 session involve overnight stay Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit ( BPRU ) residential unit . - If participant methadone , 2 session - If participant buprenorphine , 3 session . Sessions last 40 hour involve identical procedure . That mean participant stay 2 night BPRU residential unit session , session least week part . Most people complete session within 1 month . During session participant experience following : Day 1 - Admission BPRU residential unit - Participants take alcohol breath test provide urine sample check drug use ( pregnancy female ) . These test must negative admit . - Vital sign measure . - Participants receive normal dose methadone buprenorphine . Day 2 - Experimental pain test - On session day , nurse insert IV catheter arm hand involve pain test . - Investigational drug placebo give random order . During pain test session , participant receive 4 dos investigational drug placebo . If participant methadone , receive buprenorphine injection could cause opioid withdrawal symptom . Participants tell drug placebo get research staff know assignment either . - Participants 7 round experimental pain testing , last 45 minute consist pain procedure . A trained technician show participant pain test procedure practice participant learn involve respond . Participants ask complete 4 different type standard pain test session . Participants may stop procedure point tell technician wish stop . 1 . One type test produce pain device press skin shoulder arm . This produce pressure , similar pressing finger skin . Participants ask indicate pain pressure reach certain level intensity . 2 . Another type test produce pain small device give heat . An investigator put device participant 's forearm increase temperature . Some temperature cause participant experience pain , ask rate pain produce different intensity heat . 3 . The third type pain test involve place hand cold water leave long possible , reaching time limit . Participants ask rate pain feel cold water may remove hand water time . 4 . In addition pain test , investigator also test ability detect touch , warmth , cold sensation . To test touch sensitivity , series fine thread thread-like object apply forearm investigator ask participant communicate first noticing sensation . To test warmth cold sensitivity , device use test heat pain sensitivity place arm . Participants ask let investigator know first notice sensation warmth cold . At time , participant experience one type pain time . - Participants answer question experience , include question study drug placebo make feel problem study drug placebo . - Staff take participant 's vital sign take picture eye repeatedly session . - Unless participant experience symptom opioid withdrawal ( example - nausea , vomit , diarrhea loose stool , body ache , goosebump ) , give daily dose methadone buprenorphine pain test day ( Day 2 ) . Day 3 - Discharge - Vital sign measure picture eye take . - Participants answer question experience Day 2 , include question last drug effect problem study drug placebo . - Participants receive normal dose methadone buprenorphine discharge residential unit .</detailed_description>
