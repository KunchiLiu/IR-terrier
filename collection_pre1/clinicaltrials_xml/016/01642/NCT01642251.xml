	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together without cisplatin etoposide see well work treat patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer spread part body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cisplatin etoposide without veliparib may work well treat patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer metastatic large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Etoposide With Without Veliparib Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic Large Cell Neuroendocrine Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) veliparib use combination cisplatin etoposide ( CE ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine whether addition ABT-888 ( veliparib ) cisplatin etoposide ( CE ) result improve progression free survival ( PFS ) CE placebo frontline therapy newly diagnose extensive stage small cell lung cancer . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival ( OS ) associate combination CE plus ABT-888 . ( Phase II ) II . To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) well complete response rate ( CRR ) associate combination CE plus ABT-888 . ( Phase II ) III . To determine toxicity profile combination ABT-888 CE chemotherapy patient population . ( Phase II ) IV . To conduct exploratory correlative analysis impact select biomarkers . ( Phase II ) V. To compare overall toxicity profile specifically incidence severity chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy addition ABT-888 CE . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow phase II study . Phase I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 , etoposide intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1-3 , cisplatin IV 60-120 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Phase II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-7 , etoposide IV 60-120 minute day 1-3 , cisplatin IV 60-120 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-7 , etoposide IV 60-120 minute day 1-3 , cisplatin IV 60-120 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
