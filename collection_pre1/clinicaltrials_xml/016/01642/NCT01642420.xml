	<brief_summary>Alzheimers disease ( AD ) common course cognitive decline thereby course half case dementia . A proper AD diagnosis rest number examination test , combine make AD diagnosis likely . But single test examination unambiguous determine whether patient AD . Comparatively examination test accuracy predict whether healthy person person mild cognitive ( MCI ) impairment time evolve AD . Quantitative Electroencephalography ( qEEG ) , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers , linear CT analysis Timed Up Go - Dual Task ( TUG-DT ) relatively inexpensive widely available diagnostic method , potential diagnose AD early stage reliable accurate way . But also potential predict patient diagnose MCI particular risk develop dementia . The purpose study investigate relation qEEG , CSF biomarkers , CT analyse TUG-DT outcome clinical feature healthy person well patient MCI AD Furthermore investigate whether qEEG CSF biomarkers predict patient MCI time evolve AD .</brief_summary>
