	<brief_summary>Background : - Mitochondria part cell help produce energy . Metabolism process body use energy help cell grow reproduce . Metabolic mitochondrial disorder affect body ability produce store energy . These disorder cause wide variety problem , often affect muscle brain , energy requirement high . Treatment difficult exact source problem hard detect . - EPI-743 new drug base vitamin E. Tests show help improve function cell mitochondrial problem . It may able treat people genetic disorder affect metabolism mitochondrion . Objectives : - To see EPI-743 improve energy production use people mitochondrial metabolic disorder . Eligibility : - Children 2 11 year age metabolic mitochondrial problem . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - The study last 13 month . Participants seven 3- 5-day inpatient study visit 3 month apart . - Participants take either EPI-743 placebo first 6 month study . After 6 month , 1-month rest period . Then , receive EPI-743 first 6 month take placebo next 6 month . Those placebo take EPI-743 . - During inpatient study visit , participant physical exam . A 24-hour urine collection obtain . Blood sample also take . Imaging study test may perform direct study researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical manifestation disorder energy metabolism defect oxidation/reduction similar basic defect involve inability transfer electron . The true many mitochondrial disease . Affected patient exhibit wide variety sign symptom , frequent early dysfunction occur muscle brain , energy requirement high . The diagnosis type defect problematic nonspecific protean clinical manifestation disorder . Treatment equally challenge , since exact locus primary defect generally remain enigmatic . As consequence , physicians rely upon generic cocktail vitamin co-factors endogenous intermediate intend enhance mitochondrial electron transport , diminish damage reactive oxygen specie , promote energy production . The field morass , general , call trial-and-error treatment base upon empiric data . Edison Pharmaceuticals , Inc , develop vitro assay utilizes patient fibroblast model innate susceptibility oxidative stress cause disorder energy metabolism oxidation/reduction . The assay system also determine cell respond increase viability IND drug call EPI-743 . We propose clinical trial enroll 20 child meet three criterion . First , must disorder , base upon study perform clinical protocol 76-HG-0238 ( `` Diagnosis Treatment Patients Inborn Errors Metabolism Other Genetic Disorders '' ) , consistent defect energy metabolism oxidation/reduction . Second , culture fibroblast must exhibit defect ability withstand oxidant stress . Third , fibroblasts must respond EPI-743 vitro show improved viability condition oxidative stress . This protocol double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study 6-month period treatment two-month washout period . Patients admit NIH Clinical Center 2-5 day every 3 month . The primary outcome measure quality life base upon Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale ( NPMDS ) age 2-11 year ; part I-III evaluate separately part IV . Secondary outcome measure tailor patient laboratory , imaging , clinical abnormality . Results receive EPI-743 compare result receive placebo ; repeat measure analyse Student test employ . To date , 10 patient enrol , three already second arm protocol . This study include extension arm , patient offer open label EPI-743 completing crossover trial .</detailed_description>
