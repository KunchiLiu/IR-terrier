	<brief_summary>No one really know cause overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) . Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) cause similar symptom OAB difference presence bacteria , evidence routine microbiology culture . Recent work group genitourinary microbiome ( GUM ) show female urine , even absence culture evidence bacteria evidence bacterial DNA . Bacterial 16S rRNA isolate urine sequenced identify bacterial specie present urine . From investigator hypothesize urinary bacteria contribute urinary symptom difference bacterial community urine woman respond Solifenacin , drug use treat OAB , versus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bacterial Genomic Sequencing Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study two group : Women accept clinical recommendation OAB treatment solifenacin comparator ( control ) group woman unaffected OAB . All woman baseline urine assessment bacterial genome sequencing . Solifenacin treat patient also urine assessment bacterial genomic sequence 4 12 week treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Controls : Women without bother urinary symptom screen potential study participation use pelvic floor distress inventory ( PFDI ) . Women negative urinary response screen participation use follow eligibility criterion : anticholinergic medication bladder condition , antibiotic exposure past 4 week reason , immunologic deficiency , pelvic malignancy pelvic radiation , Untreated symptomatic POP &gt; POPQ Stage II . OAB cohort : Women bother overactive bladder symptom screen potential study participation use pelvic floor distress inventory ( PFDI ) . Women positive urinary response urge predominant symptom screen participation use follow eligibility criterion : willing take Solifenacin treatment OAB , neurological disease know affect low urinary tract , current UTI ( base urine dipstick ) recurrent UTI , antibiotic exposure past 4 week reason , immunologic deficiency , pelvic malignancy pelvic radiation , untreated symptomatic POP &gt; POPQ Stage II , contraindication receive Solifenacin . Women childbearing potential pregnant , nursing , intend become pregnant study practice reliable form contraception also exclude .</criteria>
