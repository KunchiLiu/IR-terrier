Acceptance-Based behavioural therapy ( ABBT ) relatively new approach effective treat mental health concern anxiety depression , also medical condition diabetes chronic pain . A novel ABBT FMS develop pilot test small group participant . The result preliminary study promising . Unfortunately , many people adequately access available treatment due long wait list , prohibitive cost , time/location constraint . Online treatment may offer improved access care without reduce effectiveness treatment . Therefore , ABBT FMS use pilot study adapt online format evaluate large group participant . A wait-list/control group employ evaluate effectiveness online treatment compare treatment-as-usual .

	<detailed_description>The current study extend pilot study ( Shay , Tkachuk , Simister , Bailly , &amp; Skrabek , 2011 ) , modify previous treatment 6 unit program could deliver online . Sixty-one participant complete study , randomly assign online ABBT plus treatment-as-usual ( online ABBT + TAU ) group treatment-as-usual alone ( TAU ) group . All participant complete series self-report measure baseline , post-treatment , 3-month follow-up . Linear mixed modelling support significant difference group favour ABBT + TAU treatment group primary outcome measure ( Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised ( FIQ-R ) ; F ( 2 , 52.82 ) = 20.10 , p &lt; .0001 ) follow treatment . The online ABBT + TAU group also significantly great improvement depression , pain , acceptance , perceive helplessness , kinesiophobia . Increased acceptance mediate effect treatment improvement FMS quality life FMS impact , reduce helplessness mediate effect treatment improvement level report pain . Comments subjective rating improvement consistent quantitative result . Participants rat mindfulness ( contact present moment experience ) useful treatment unit .</detailed_description>
