	<brief_title>Dalantercept Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) treat dalantercept . II . To determine nature degree toxicity dalantercept cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer treat dalantercept . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-β ) , activin receptor-like kinase 1 ( ALK1 ) , endoglin ( CD105 ) , marker via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) determine correlation expression clinical response treatment . II . To determine correlation ALK1 gene expression , marker , clinical response treatment . III . To determine correlation concentration VEGF , bone morphogenetic protein 9 ( BMP9 ) , bone morphogenetic protein 10 ( BMP10 ) , ALK1 pre-cycle 1 plasma use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , clinical response treatment . IV . To correlate somatic mutation candidate gene response therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive dalantercept subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample collect VEGF , FGF , PDGF , TGF-β , ALK1 , CD105 , ALK1 , BMP9 , BMP10 protein analysis gene expression IHC , ELISA , reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
