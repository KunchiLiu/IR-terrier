	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) continue one serious bacterial infection worldwide therefore new improve diagnostic test need help doctor diagnose TB . The new skin test name C-Tb . Like current tuberculin skin test , PPD , C-Tb test inject skin , positive , show redness and/or swell injection site negative test leave reaction . The investigator hope new C-Tb skin test precise ( specific ) PPD test , PPD test e.g . may show reaction person test BCG vaccinate . The aim trial test C-Tb skin test volunteer suspect TB disease . With focus age , HIV status CD4 count follow analysis do ( overall perspective ) : - To compare C-Tb test blood test , QuantiFERON test . - To compare C-Tb test PPD test currently use . - To assess safety C-Tb test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Subjects Suspected Have Tuberculosis , Comparing Diagnostic Performance C-Tb QuantiFERON® , Combination With Safety Assessment C-Tb Versus Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TESEC-05 trial open comparison diagnostics performance C-Tb compare QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube , combination double-blind randomized split-body safety assessment C-Tb versus 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI . The trial multi-centre Phase III clinical trial design specifically address C-Tb relation paediatric population HIV infection . The intention evaluate C-Tb test performs paediatric population respect safety , ensure SSI able extrapolate data obtain adult population paediatric population . Furthermore , intention evaluate diagnostic performance safety C-Tb HIV infected individual evaluate whether SSI able extrapolate data obtain non-HIV population HIV population . The trial population consist paediatric participant suspect TB infection adult participant suspect TB disease . Furthermore control group 100 child 5 - 11 year age symptoms know exposure recruit area `` low '' prevalence TB ( area incidence rate &lt; 299/100,000 per year , average rate TB South Africa 2005 645/100,000 per year . The trial conduct South Africa prevalence HIV infection high MTb infection endemic . BCG vaccination birth common practice since 1961 South Africa . Thus participant presume BCG vaccinate .</detailed_description>
