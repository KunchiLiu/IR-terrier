	<brief_summary>Although multiple study suggest treatment ranibizumab safe efficacious superior focal/grid laser alone patient center-involved diabetic macular edema ( DME ) , may barriers place widespread adoption ranibizumab use give high cost per dose need multiple treatment time . Prioritizing resource public health policy perspective could easier precise estimate regard risk benefit anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) therapy available , especially difference cost could billions dollar year . Thus , clear rationale time explore potential anti-VEGF alternative ranibizumab might prove efficacious , might deliver equally lasting longer-lasting treatment effect , cost substantially less . Of potentially available alternative anti-VEGF agent trial , bevacizumab aflibercept best candidate direct comparison study . Bevacizumab share similar molecular structure , cost far less , widely available . Furthermore , already preliminary evidence suggest may efficacious treatment DME already widely use indication . Although aflibercept similar cost per unit dose ranibizumab , potential decrease treatment burden associate cost . If result comparative trial demonstrate improve efficacy suggest similar efficacy bevacizumab aflibercept ranibizumab , information might give clinician scientific rationale substitute either one drug ranibizumab treatment DME , might thereby substantial implication public policy term future estimate health care dollar possibly number treatment necessary anti-VEGF treatment diabetic macular disease . Because availability low cost , bevacizumab already currently widespread clinical use treatment DME despite lack FDA approval indication . Thus , clinical trial suggest whether bevacizumab could use safe efficacious alternative ranibizumab could substantially impact nationwide practice pattern treatment DME either validate current use bevacizumab demonstrate improve outcome ranibizumab aflibercept treatment DME . Study Objective The primary objective propose research compare efficacy safety ( 1 ) intravitreal aflibercept , ( 2 ) intravitreal bevacizumab , ( 3 ) intravitreal ranibizumab give treat central-involved DME eye visual acuity 20/32 20/320 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Individuals &lt; 18 year old include DME rare age group diagnosis DME may questionable . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization criterion ( see Procedures Manual definition ) At least one eye meet follow study eye criterion : Best correct ElectronicEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity letter score ≤ 78 ( i.e. , 20/32 bad ) ≥ 24 ( i.e. , 20/320 better ) within eight day randomization . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema involve center macula . Diabetic macular edema present optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ( central subfield thickness OCT &gt; 250 µm Zeiss Stratus equivalent spectral domain OCTs base gender specific cutoff ) , within eight day randomization . Investigator must verify accuracy OCT scan ensuring center adequate quality ( Zeiss Stratus , standard deviation center point thickness ≤ 10 % center point thickness signal strength ≥ 6 ) Media clarity , pupillary dilation , individual cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph Able willing provide inform consent . Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . •Individuals poor glycemic control , within last four month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next four month enrol . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication study time study entry . • Note : study participant receive another investigational drug participate study . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . • If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , individual become eligible . Myocardial infarction , acute cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 4 month prior randomization . Systemic antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within four month prior randomization anticipate use study . • These drug use study . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 24 month . Women potential study participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . Individual expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center first 12 month study . The following exclusion apply study eye ( i.e. , may present nonstudy eye ) : Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An eye consider eligible : ( 1 ) macular edema consider related ocular surgery cataract extraction ( 2 ) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface abnormality ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity three line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . History antiVEGF treatment DME past 12 month history treatment DME time past four month ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid ) . Enrollment limit maximum 25 % plan sample size history antiVEGF treatment DME . Once number eye enrol , history antiVEGF treatment DME exclusion criterion . History panretinal photocoagulation within four month prior randomization anticipate need panretinal photocoagulation six month follow randomization . History antiVEGF treatment disease DME past 12 month . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior four month anticipate within next six month follow randomization . History YAG capsulotomy perform within two month prior randomization . Aphakia . Exam evidence external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , significant blepharitis .</criteria>
