	<detailed_description>Study aim A : Red cell mass hypoxia : Various form altitude train use increase particular endurance performance elite athlete . The commonly use approach either live train altitude ( Live high - train high ; LHTH ) live high altitude train sea level ( Live high - train low ; LHTL ) . While generally accept potential performance enhance effect LHTH LHTL mediate hypoxia dependent increase red cell mass ( 1 ) , never demonstrate experimentally . In 2010 investigator conduct first placebo control double blind LHTL study ( support BASPO funding ) clear aim identify mechanism ( ) responsible performance enchantment follow LHTL . In brief , reason 16 elite athlete ( average VO2max ≈ 70 ml.kg.min ) reside 16 hours/day either normoxia stimulate altitude 3000 four week . This protocol chosen base recent review expert within field ( 2 ) . Despite supposedly optimal set investigator find single positive change induce LHTL . To big surprise despite measure VO2max , time trial performance , red cell mass , marker erythropoiesis much high frequency previous LHTL study remain unaffected LHTL . Based experience within altitude physiology study include erythropoietin injection human , investigator begin speculate even 3 week continuous altitude exposure sufficient stimulus increase red cell mass cornerstone assumption LHTL ( 1 , 3 ) . If case , scientific rationale perform LHTL vanishes . The initial determination red cell mass altitude date 100 year back Douglas ( 4 ) report 6 week exposure 2300 altitude Gran Canaries increase red cell mass whereas htc increase . Some 50 year later Lawrence ( 5 ) conclude true increase red cell mass require several week ( 8 ) altitude exposure ( 3800 ) , whereas decrease plasma volume begin upon arrival . It note used superb method determine red cell mass : autologous red cell tag radioactive phosphorous , something possible today . In 1964 Hannon ( 6 ) conduct classic study expose 8 female 8 male 4300 altitude 9 full week . During first month increase red cell mass , next 5 week red cell mass increase 5 % despite continued iron supplementation . The method use particular study autologous chromium-51-labbeled red cell , i.e . gold standard . Even severely high altitude 5450 ( relevance elite sport ) , Reynafarje ( 7 ) report 6 week require increase red cell volume . To follow previous altitude study impossible , recent review Grover Bärtsch ( 8 ) summarize state `` True polycythemia develop residence high altitude ( 3800-4500m ) extend month year '' . Thus , compare altitude research do past regard red cell mass , mostly conduct use technique far superior use today high latitude apply LHTL protocol , proposal LHTL increase red cell mass seem odds . It keep mind however , altitude study difficult isolate effect hypoxia , also change temperature , nutritional intake physical activity level often confound factor . Levine Stray-Gundersen ( 3 ) first report increase red cell mass follow LHTL . After 3 week LHTL 2500 calculate RCV increase 8 % base change plasma volume derive Evens Blue . Evens blue poor measure change RCV since rapidly leaks circulation , data take caution . It also interest increase RCV observe 50 % LHTL subject . This exclude observe change simply result biological variation ( 9 ) . In 10 year follow first positive LHTL result data could replicate . Especially Australian research group lead Chris Gore make huge effort period could confirm 3 week LHTH normobaric LHTL cause RCV increase ( 10-16 ) . From 2006 onwards positive effect LHTL report RCV , data far convincing . The research group J.P. Richalet conduct series experiment Premanon , find red cell mass increase one study ( 17 ) , unchanged another two study ( 18 , 19 ) . J Wehrlin Bundesamt für Sport find three week LHTL increase RCV ( 20 ) , study design clean subject different discipline serve control treatment subject . This problem since different stage train season exclude affect RCV . Since subject elite athletes compete international level also pity anti-doping sample collect subject 's population . Chris Gore last year apply unusual statistical approach thereby report call `` marginal '' increase RCV follow LHTL ( 21 ) . This conclusion however draw use standard accept statistical approach . Thus , although generally accept LHTL may increase RCV , picture clear expect , investigator argue rather unlikely compare mention chronic altitude exposure study . The main aim present study determine large study population ( n=16 ) continuous exposure 3450 altitude four week increase red cell mass . The investigator choose altitude 1 ) In population live permanently altitude , elevate red cell volume report compare countryman live near sea level , 2 ) If investigator choose low altitude , investigator observe increase red cell mass investigator would able determine whether consequence low altitude short exposure duration , 3 ) Exposure much high elevation may suitable athlete . Study protocol Study aim A : Red cell mass hypoxia One month altitude exposure subject weekly basis RCV ( CO rebreathing ) hematological parameter quantify two separate day separate one day ( i.e . Monday Tuesday , Tuesday Wednesday etc ) . This allow good estimation basal hematological value . Light iron supplementation ( 40 mg/day start day 1 keep throughout study ) . Furthermore , subject perform light bike exercise 1.0 W/kg body weight 30 minute every second day month . Such light activity know influence red cell mass ( 22 ) . The activity continue altitude exposure period Jungfraujoch ( see ) , order limit potential effect altitude/confinement induce physical inactivity may induce decrease plasma volume , however report eliminated even light ( 23 ) . On two occasions/week Jungfraujoch subject escort Mönchhütte ( altitude ) back ( total 60 min walking ) order also keep physical activity . While altitude subject perform test sea level , i.e . double determination hematological parameter weekly basis . Study aim B : Cardiovascular adjustment high altitude : Classic study Grollman Pikes Peak ( 4300m ) US demonstrate approximately 40 % increase rest cardiac output ( heart rate × stroke volume ) within first day ascent high altitude ( Grollman 1930 ) . Similar observation make rigorously controlled condition laboratory , equivalent degree hypoxia ( 24 , 25 ) . Changes stroke volume play minor role altitude induced increase cardiac output , response ( 90-95 % ) seem result increase heart rate ( 24 , 25 ) . Following day altitude exposure however , cardiac output return sea level value even low value despite hypoxemia still persist ( 26 ) . The decrease cardiac output surprising occur despite continuous increased heart rate consequence reduction stroke volume ( 26 , 27 ) . Similar data report exercise , i.e . decrease stroke volume submaximal maximal exercise ( 28 ) . The physiological mechanism lead reduction stroke volume rest exercise continuous exposure high altitude remain unknown , main aim Study B resolve issue . Since cardiac output large degree depend blood volume ( Frank-Starling mechanism ) leave ventricular filling , tempt speculate altitude dependent decrease plasma volume hence also total blood volume cause right ventricle fill subsequently also stroke volume reduce . To test hypothesis intervention perform : 1 . To facilitate venous return , hence right ventricle filling , subject weekly basis test commonly use tilt-table . The tilt table allow investigation subject supine position various head-down tilt . The investigator wish study volunteer 5 minute head tilt ( tilt ) -15 , -30 -45° , normal procedure . The head tilt facilitate venous return hence stroke volume . The large effect usually see around -70° . During last minute tilt cardiac output ass inert re-breathing technique ( investigators procedure approve ETH ethical board previous application ) ultra sound doppler . Heart rate blood pressure continuously monitor non-invasively . 2 . On last study day Jungfraujoch plasma volume restore sea level value infusion Dextran . The exact volume dextran infuse calculated multiplying red cell volume ( assess project A ) hematocrit . Cardiac output assess supine seat position immediately infusion Dextran . 3 . Stroke volume heart rate determine submaximal maximal exercise inert-gas re-breathing weekly basis acclimatization . The investigator hypothesize expect change stroke volume correlate well altitude induce change plasma blood volume . Study C : Autonomic nervous control high altitude : Exposure hypoxia cause sympathoexcitation human . This determine indirectly measurements hypoxia-induced increase noradrenaline ( Cunningham et al. , 1965 ) directly increase muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( Saito et al. , 1988 ) . The primary underlying mechanism activation chemoreceptor carotid body ( Marshall , 1994 ) brainstem ( Solomon , 2000 ) . Thus , acute exposure hypoxia , heart rate sympathetic nerve activity change significantly blood oxygen saturation decrease 85 % ( Smith et al. , 1996 ) . In human , level saturation result breathe hypoxic gas mixture FIO2 0.11-0.13 individual variation ( Lundby et al. , 2004 ) . Recently demonstrate sea level resident acclimatize 4 week altitude 5260m sea level exhibit surprisingly high level muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( Hansen &amp; Sander , 2003 ) . The average muscle sympathetic burst frequency increase 300 % sea level value , considerably 50-100 % expect acute exposure correspond hypoxic gas mixture ( FIO2 0.105 ) . One limitation first study inclusion one time-point altitude acclimatization . Thus , unknown whether high altitude sympathoexcitation measure microneurography subsides acclimatization sea level resident . The specific mechanism underlying apparent high altitude sympathoexcitation unclear . Concurrent breathe pure oxygen intravenous infusion saline high altitude restore blood homeostasis cause minor decrease muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( Hansen &amp; Sander , 2003 ) , suggest traditional activation peripheral chemoreflex cardiopulmonary baroreflex account sympathoexcitation . In stead , chronic exposure hypoxia may cause reset central nervous pathway involve sympathoexcitatory reflex . There grow body evidence support pharmacologically-induced inhibition brainstem nitric oxide signal cause amplification reset sympathoexcitatory reflex , suggest accumulation endogenous inhibitor nitric oxide could similarly involve human sympathoexcitatory state . The underlie mechanism high altitude sympathoexcitation ( point 1-5 ) It unknown chronic hypoxia cause sympathoexcitation , potential underlying mechanism describe : 1 . Arterial baroreflex-activation . In previous high altitude MSNA-studies sea level resident minor significant increase arterial blood pressure 8-12mmHg ( 29 , 30 ) , rule arterial baroreflex unloading . Resetting arterial baroreflex rule contribute factor , unlikely major mechanism . 2 . Cardiopulmonary baroreflex-activation . In chronic high altitude study ( 29 ) , intravenous infusion saline ( 800-1000ml 15 min ) cause small decrease sympathetic traffic , provide evidence unload cardiopulmonary baroreceptor primary contributor . 3 . Chemoreflex-sensitization . The ventilatory sympathoexcitatory response high altitude acclimatization share several characteristic . Both response develop gradually day , establish normalization slow day re-exposure normoxia ( 29 , 31 , 32 ) . Ventilatory sympathetic chemoreflexes share afferent input peripheral chemoreceptor , central neuronal circuitry responsible efferent activation phrenic nerve sympathetic outflow parallel . The investigator hypothesize hyperventilatory sympathoexcitatory response chronic hypoxic exposure share underlying mechanism . Ventilatory acclimatization high altitude think primarilly depend chemoreflex-sensitization , i.e . despite stable even slightly improve arterial oxygen tension first 2 week acclimatization , hypoxic chemoreflex ventilatory response ( HVR ) slowly augment . The basis unique reflex-sensitization study quite extensively last several decade . In human , likely peripheral central mechanism involve . Peripherally , signal event chemoreceptor within carotid aortic body complex involve several excitatory inhibitory transmitter . The excitatory signal include adenosine , ATP , acetylcholine endothelin . The primary inhibitory signal molecule dopamine ( act D2-receptors , D2R ) ( 33 ) , noradrenaline , NO . In human , intravenous low-dose dopamine D2R-antagonist domperidone ( administer orally ) able decrease augment sea level HVR , respectively ( 34 , 35 ) , maximal hypoxic ventilation ( 36 ) . Neither low-dose dopamine domperidone cross blood-brain barrier . Although , dopamine production effect within carotid body may decrease first day hypoxic exposure ( 37 , 38 ) , enzymes involved dopamine production , dopamine receptor , dopamine-concentration ( noradrenaline ) upregulated chronic hypoxia ( 38 ) . The functional consequence ventilatory response human study sparingly , one study suggest effect dopamine dompridone HVR unaltered slightly large subject expose hypoxia 8h ( 35 ) . The role NO peripheral chemoreception study human , recent animal study suggest peripheral inhibitory action NO confound NO-mediated disinhibition dopamine-effects . Thus , sodium nitroprusside actually increase peripheral chemoreceptor fire cat perhaps block endogenous dopamine-inhibition ( 39 ) . Centrally , chemoreceptor-afferent activation cause release L-glutamate dopamine within nucleus tractus solitarii ( NTS ) . These event lead excitation NTS-neurons turn via L-glutamate excite brainstem neuron within rostral ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM ) . The collected input RVLM-neurons control central sympathetic outflow brainstem . Animal study suggest modulation chemoreflex pathway within NTS dopamine ( excitatory ) ( 40 ) nitric oxide ( NO ) ( excitatory ) ( 41 ) become significant hypoxic exposure . Thus microinjection sodium nitroprusside NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA NTS awake rat cause increase decrease ventilation hypoxic exposure ( 41 ) . The role central D2R hypoxia study rat compare HVR domperidone ( peripheral D2R blockade ) HVR domperidone + haloperidol ( peripheral centrally act D2R blocker ) ( 42 ) . The overall effect haloperidol alone ventilatory response isocapnic hypoxia human reduction HVR ( 43 ) . While number neuronal pathway transmitter peripherally centrally may play physiological role chemoreflex-sensitization link altitude-acclimatization , recent study D2R-knock-out mouse provide compelling evidence D2R prerequisite ( 44 ) . For reason present study test whether sensitization chemoreceptor underlie cause high altitude sympathoexcitation , whether dopamine- NO-related mechanism involve . In regard , note , acute hyperoxia even three day normoxic breathe fail normalize sympathetic traffic healthy subject acclimatize high altitude 4 week ( 29 ) . However , similar finding report ventilation . Thus , chronic hypoxia may cause substantial sensitization chemoreflex , even hyperoxia may fail silence primary peripheral chemoafferents carotid aortic body , speculate hyperoxia may actually cause central excitation ventilatory sympathetic output acclimatization altitude . 4 . Decreased NO-production brainstem-vasomotor center . Soon discover NO important endothelium-derived vasodilator , NO also emerge neuromodulator augment glutamatergic neurotransmission ( 45 ) . It since well establish animal model overall functional significance NO deficiency within brain stem center sympathoexcitation augmentation sympathoexcitatory reflex ( 46 ) . This form sympathoexcitation identify human ( 47 ) . Thus , study indicate increase NO-production within NTS , overall NO-production could decrease hypoxic exposure . Indeed , recent human study suggest least relative NO-deficiency low blood cGMP-levels hypoxic exposure ( 48 ) . In high altitude study , intravenous infusion NO substrate , L-arginine , effect sympathetic traffic ( Lundby et al. , 2002abstract ) . This finding exclude NO-deficiency chronic hypoxia , merely indicate putative deficiency relate relative lack substrate NO synthesis . The present study adresses unresolved issue two independent way . First , whole-body NO-production determine novel stable-isotope technique . Second , L-NAME use produce NO synthase inhibition . Under ambient air condition reveal whether functional significance endogenous NO-production decrease chronic hypoxia . During HVR-testing L-NAME may complex effect chemoreflex due disinhibition level peripheral chemoreceptor indirect inhibitory action within NTS brainstem . 5 . Neurophysiological characteristic high altitude sympathoexcitation The high altitude sympathoexcitation yet characterise use single-unit recording . The single-unit characteristic fire probability probability dual multiple single-unit firing within one heart cycle allow cross-sectional comparison sympathetic traffic lowlander high altitude native . Furthermore , sympathetic single-unit characteristic recently publish sympathoexcitatory state heart failure , sleep apnoea , hypertension ( 49 ) . Thus , important comparison make sympathoexcitatory state . The fire characteristic may important implication noradrenaline release . Peripheral uncoupling sympathetic activity vasomotor tone Despite dramatic increase sympathetic nerve activity , noradrenaline release , limited ( albeit statistically significant ) increase vascular resistance blood pressure high altitude . This logically related hypoxia-induced peripheral offset sympathetic vasoconstriction . The uncoupling could cause least partially alpha-receptor downregulation , although significant decrease cardiac alpha-1-receptors rat live hypobaric hypoxia 21 day ( 50 ) . In addition , acute severe hypoxic exposure also cause uncoupling sympathetic activity vasomotor tone . Thus , humans use FiO2 0.08 , sympathetic traffic high , vascular resistance blood pressure decrease ( 51 ) . This acute hypoxia effect unlikely explain receptor downregulation . Hypotheses high altitude sympathoexcitation test proposed application : 1 . The high altitude sympathoexcitation characterise increase probability sympathetic single-unit firing , resemble characteristic sympathoexcitation heart failure . 2 . Chronic hypoxic exposure cause substantial sensitisation chemoreflex , least partially explain sympathoexcitation high altitude . 3a ) Central nervous D2R-mediated dopamine effect importantly involve chemoreflex sensitisation high altitude sympathoexcitation . 3b ) Altered NO-signaling importantly involve chemoreflex sensitisation high altitude sympathoexcitation . Hypotheses peripheral uncoupling sympathetic response 4 ) Chronic hypoxic exposure cause decreased local whole body nitric oxide production . Volunteers study 4 time ( 2 control study Zürich , without L-NAME , 2 study Jungfraujoch week 3 ) , without L-NAME . Each study day include follow : Meaurements : BP , HR , Plethysmographic limb blood flow , Ventilation ( incl oxygen uptake ) , Pulseoximetry , MSNA single-units , MSNA multi-units full chemoreflex-study . Blood sample : Including : Catecholamines , RBC-channels , cGMP . Condition : - Rest - Chemoreflex ( 6 different oxygen level arterial blood ) ( protocol suggest Mou et al . 1995 ) . NB-1 : CO2 keep ambient breathing level ( i.e . rest value measure individual ) , add small amount CO2 chemoreflex test . NB-2 : On one study day , intravenous dopamine-infusion ( 3 µg kg -1 min-1 ) ( Dahan et al . 1996 ) , domperidone-tablets ( 0,75 mg kg-1 ) ( Pedersen et al . 1999 , Lundby et al . 2001 ) , intravenous metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) ( Takeuchi et al . 1993 ) use sequence sea level Jungfraujoch inhibit disinhibit peripheral chemoafferent firing , subsequently inhibit central D2R-related chemoreflex excitation . Dopamine effect disappear within minute stop infusion ( Dahan et al . 1996 , Jarnberg et al . 1981 ) . Domperidone effect reach maximum 30 minute tablet ingestion , remain fairly stable another 30 minute . At dos , dopamine domperidone cross blood-brain barrier consequently contribution central sensor hypoxia unaltered . Metoclopramide report cause increase sympathetic activity sea level . If investigator confirm domperidone-treatment sea level , decrease sympathetic traffic high altitude strongly suggest hypoxia-related change central D2R-related chemoreflex excitation . Study aim D : Skeletal muscle adipose tissue metabolic adjustment high altitude : Hypoxia-dependent control mitochondrial function long interest however surprisingly little known regard topic either human animal . Previous observation mitochondrial modification follow acclimatization altitude ( especially high extreme altitude ) inconsistent . Initial report ( 52-55 ) demonstrate great expression indirect marker suggestive enhance oxidative potential animal human native high altitude , lead investigator postulate acclimatization may improve respiratory capacity mitochondrial function response increasingly hypoxic environment ( 55 ) . This initial paradigm challenge study lowlander sojourn high/extreme altitude report either dramatic loss skeletal muscle mitochondrion ( 56 , 57 ) negligible change mitochondrial profile follow acclimatization high/extreme altitude ( 58-62 ) , even despite significant reduction skeletal muscle mass ( 60 , 61 ) . One consistency across literature , however , assumption mitochondrial function ( i.e . respiratory capacity , substrate control respiration , efficiency couple control ) represent via static measurement alone mitochondrial specific protein concentrations/activity morphometric analysis represent mitochondrial content volume , respectively . While static measurement discount , vital study understand mitochondrial physiology , rely measurement characterization mitochondrial function oxidative potential incomplete . Examination mitochondrial function require direct specific manipulation mitochondrial respiration potential change oxidative phosphorylation electron transport identify . Alterations whole body protein turnover ( 63 ) hypoxia facilitate change protein concentration , include several mitochondrial protein ( 64 ) study already report . To elucidate hypoxia induce change skeletal muscle mitochondrial function follow acclimatization high altitude , investigator wish assess mitochondrial function permeabilized skeletal muscle fiber adipose tissue sea level approximately 20-24 day exposure high altitude .</detailed_description>
