	<brief_summary>For past 50 year , gastric cancer one ten frequent cancer second leading cause cancer-related death world . In Taiwan , fifth common cause cancer-related death , account 6.3 % cancer death . The poor prognosis gastric cancer mostly cause extensive metastasis lymph node , liver , peritoneal dissemination even curative resection perform . The main cause recurrence curative noncurative resection advance tumor peritoneal metastasis possible direct spillage dissemination tumor cell result surgical manipulation , associate poor prognosis . As yet , effective treatment develop condition . The development peritoneal metastasis multistep process , begin attachment peritoneal mesothelial cell , retraction mesothelial cell exposure basement membrane , attachment basement membrane , degradation extracellular matrix , proliferation cancer cell , angiogenesis , clear many type agent involve various stage process . Developing new therapeutic method mode metastasis important improvement gastric cancer treatment . CTGF secretory protein belong CCN family ( one among three originally discover member : cysteine-rich61 , CTGF , nephroblastoma-overexpressed gene ) . It multifunctional growth factor involve wound healing , inflammation , cell adhesion , chemotaxis , apoptosis , tumor growth , fibrosis . Recent study show overexpression CTGF human oral squamous cell carcinoma reduces cell growth tumorigenecity . Similar tumor growth inhibitory effect observe lung cancer cell CTGF overexpression less angiogenic metastatic due block VEGF A signal pathway . CTGF also report key regulator colorectal cancer invasion metastasis , appear well prognostic factor . These study suggest CTGF may involve process peritoneal metastasis include cancer cell adhesion peritoneum , proliferation angiogenesis . Peritoneal mesothelium first surface encounter disseminated tumor cell successful adhesion , therefore , paramount importance metastasis formation . Therefore , hypothesize CTGF potential molecule target , may relate cell adhesion peritoneum , first step peritoneal metastasis , exact mechanism may include proliferation angiogenesis . In order answer important question , first , perform preliminary study prove CTGF express different gastric cancer cell line include AGS , N87 , TSGH , MKN-45 use RT-PCR Western blotting , gastric cancer tissue use immunohistochemical method . Second , demonstrate different level CTGF expression different cell line pose different adhesion ability in-vitro adhesion assay . Third , conduct transient CTGF-overexpressed MKN45 gastric cancer cell line , CTGF-overexpressed cell line lower adhesive ability compare control . Next step project , study role CTGF play cellular molecular biology vitro vivo clinical significance associate therapeutic potential peritoneal metastasis gastric cancer . We generate stable clone MKN45 cell harbor CTGF control cell line elucidate role CTGF cancer cell adhesion , proliferation angiogenesis peritoneum .</brief_summary>
