	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn tobacco dependence nicotine metabolism African-Americans white , study see fast person metabolizes nicotine ( body break nicotine inactive compound ) affect dependent smoking cigarette . The investigator believe people faster rate metabolism may severe nicotine withdrawal symptom also may harder time try quit smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Nicotine Metabolism Effect Tobacco Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study use nicotine metabolite ratio ( NMR ) ( ratio nicotine metabolites 3'hydroxycotinine cotinine ) simple clinically feasible biomarker rate nicotine metabolism . The investigator hypothesize fast rate metabolism lead fast elimination nicotine body rapid dissipation brain tolerance nicotine interval cigarette , lead turn ( 1 ) severe nicotine withdrawal symptom ( 2 ) great subjective reward cigarette smoke following deprivation . These effect would help explain smoker faster rate nicotine metabolism poorer response smoke cessation therapy compare slow rate metabolism . The investigator explore relationship NMR endophenotypes withdrawal , crave reward , assumption factor likely intermediary mechanism link nicotine metabolism tobacco dependence smoking cessation rate pharmacotherapy . Our study design use brief ( 6 hour ) interval smoke abstinence follow `` reward '' cigarette elicit subjective response relate withdrawal reward . Because smoke behavior severity nicotine dependence vary race sex investigator also compare relationship NMR withdrawal reward African American v white smoker men vs woman . Secondary analysis examine whether nicotine half-life mediates observe effect NMR primary response measure .</detailed_description>
