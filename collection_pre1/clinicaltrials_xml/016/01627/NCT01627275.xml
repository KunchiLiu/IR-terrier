	<detailed_description>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) offer hope cure wide variety hematologic malignancy . Mature donor T-cells play critical role success failure procedure . A subset donor T-cells mediate graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . Other subset provide foundation immune recovery . Pan-depletion mature donor T-cells obligate step haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Without step , recipient would succumb lethal acute GVHD . We extensive experience in-vivo donor ( recipient ) T-cell depletion use alemtuzumab part bone marrow condition regimen . We others also use anti-thymocyte globulin purpose . Pan-depletion T-cells eliminates GvHD significantly increase risk tumor relapse opportunistic infection . A delayed donor lymphocyte infusion augments immune recovery graft versus tumor response , come risk induce lethal GvHD . This particularly problematic donor recipient HLA-discordant . Thus major challenge allogeneic stem cell transplantation determine maximally exploit beneficial effect mediate T-cells without cause GvHD . This challenge could overcome selectively deplete population donor T-cells responsible elicit GvHD response . We interested select T-cells base naïve memory phenotype understand contribution cell pathogenesis GvHD . Naïve T-cells ( CD62L+ CD45RA+ ) T-cells encounter antigen specific T-cell receptor . Memory T-cells ( CD62L- CD62L+ CD45RA- ) T-cells previously expose correspond cognate antigen . If donor encounter host alloantigens , GvHD-inducing host-reactive T-cells contain naïve T-cell compartment . In contrast , memory phenotype cell recognize host alloantigens . If hypothesis correct suggest several publish study , CD62L- T-cells , devoid naïve T-cells represent subset memory T-cells , able induce GvHD . The study hypothesis depletion naïve T-cells donor lymphocyte inoculum abrogate GVHD provide immunocompetent memory T-cells affect anti-infection graft versus tumor response . In study , determine maximum tolerate dose naïve T-cell deplete donor lymphocyte infusion give patient follow HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation . We assess GVHD-inducing potential donor lymphocyte infusion monitor impact DLI post-transplant immune recovery .</detailed_description>
