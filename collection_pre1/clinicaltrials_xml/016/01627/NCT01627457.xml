	<brief_summary>In Prestudy follow multicentral GEx- main-trial , feasibility new cardiac rehabilitation device ( GEx system ) prove coronary heart disease patient participate cardiac rehabilitation training exercise rehabilitation clinic ( phase II ) subsequently home ( phase III ) . The GEx system consist easy-to-wear vest integrate electrode measure electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , respiration activity , furthermore PDA collect store monitor data cradle charge battery . Several physiological parameter extract thes measure vital sign like heart rate , breathe rate , ECG activity . In pretrial first GEx sensor system validate guided exercise patient rehabilitation clinic ( phase II ) . Subsequently home ( phase III ) practicability vest sensor possible technical problem real- life use prove . This mean moderate training like walking , cycle run home 3 week patient report feasibility usage . The ECG data breathing- frequency data analyze see data record transmit well regard technical problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Cycle Prestudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During rehabilitation process ( phase II ) patient coronary heart disease ( CAD ) 30 patient recruit make familiar new Guided Exercise ( GEx ) training system exercise training ; supervise provide training instruction medicine 3 time week 3 week long . At begin end study patient undergo several test clinical routine cardiopulmonary test ( CPX ) , echocardiography lactate measurement ; additionally , test register system obtain information detection heart rate rise example . Data analyze quality heart rate measurement data acquisition device . In second step GEx system hand 30 patient leave in-patient cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) . The pre-trial serve gather information practicability technical problem real-life use . Therefore home 30 patient continue moderate endurance training like walking , cycle run wear GEx system three time week 3 week . After three week patient come back clinic undergo end examination report feasibility usage . The ECG data breathe frequency data analyze see data record transmit well regard technical problem . If accurate safe data receive follow GEx- main- trial ( ID 11-020 ) investigate GEx- system CAD patient regard improvement physical capacity obtain long term adherence home base rehabilitation program ( phase III ) include feedback patient compare national standard rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
