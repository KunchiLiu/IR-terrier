	<criteria>Previously document CLL define 2008 International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guideline [ Hallek 2008 ( ) ] , recurrent relapse previous therapy require treatment . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Measurable disease criterion assess response . Patients must least ONE : Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 10 x 10^9/L OR At least one pathologically enlarge lymph node ( ≥ 2 x 2 cm ) CT scan Previous Therapy Patients must receive least one , may receive three prior systemic treatment regimen ( single agent combination therapy ) , limit number prior regimen . Systemic Therapy : Patients must receive least one prior systemic treatment regimen ( single agent combination therapy ) . There limit number prior regimen . Patients must ≥ 4 week since last dose systemic therapy ( include investigational ) . Exceptions 4week interval since last treatment possible prior therapy nonmyelosuppressive treatmentrelated myelosuppression resolve . Rationale : Based review recently publish phase II trial CDK inhibitor relapse refractory CLL , appear sufficient ground restrict number previous cycle systemic chemotherapy . The IND193 investigator predict change affect either safety efficacy outcome study drug . Not permit : Radioactive Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Prior treatment AT7519M another CDK inhibitor Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant ( Note : autologous stem cell transplant permit ) Radiation : Patients may radiation , provide minimum 21 day elapse prior enrollment . ( Exceptions may make however , low dose , palliative radiotherapy Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior registration . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur least 14 day elapse surgery major . Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology = Absolute neutrophil ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelets = ≥ 75 x 10^9/L ( exception : ITP secondary CLL , allow 50 x 10^9/L ) Chemistry = Creatinine clearance* ≥ 50 mL/min Creatine Phosphokinase = ( CK CPK ) ≤ UNL Bilirubin = ≤ UNL AST ALT = ≤ 2.5 x UNL Potassium , Calcium , Magnesium Within normal limit Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form provide separate attachment . A copy initial REB approval approve consent form must send central office . The patient must sign consent form prior registration . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission NCIC CTG monitoring agency review patient record . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event , followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , situ cancer invasive malignancy curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Patients know CNS involvement CLL . Tests investigate CNS involvement require clinically indicate ( i.e . disease suspect basis symptom finding ) . Patients clinically suspect proven progression high grade lymphoma ( Richter 's transformation ) myelodysplasia . Patients know hypersensitivity study drug component . The following exclusion enrolment study : 1 . Pregnant lactating woman . ( N.B . : All woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration ) . 2 . Men woman childbearing potential agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . ( Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant , man father child , participate study , she/he inform treat physician immediately . ) Serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include , limited : 1. history significant neurologic psychiatric disorder ( e.g . uncontrolled psychotic disorder ) would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement ; 2. active uncontrolled serious infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) ; 3. pulmonary disease require oxygen ; 4. know HIV infection immune deficiency disorder ( except CLL ) ; 5. medical condition might aggravate study treatment Patients preexist cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction follow : 1 . Significant cardiac event ( include heart failure ischemia ) within 3 month entry cardiac disease , opinion investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia 2 . Any family personal history ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic require treatment ( CTC grade 3 ) . This include : multifocal PVCs , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia ) 3 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg high diastolic blood pressure 95 mmHg high ) 4 . A previous history drug induce QTc prolongation ( define QTc interval equal great 500 msec ) significant ECG abnormalities 5 . Congenital long QT syndrome 6 . QT QTc , unmeasurable &gt; 460 msec screen ECG 7 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less institution 's low limit normal ( LLN ) measure MUGA echocardiogram Patients currently receive treatment agent know risk Torsades de Pointes . ( see http : //torsades.org [ list # 1 ] ) . However , patient may enrol study treatment agent stop ≥ 7 day prior first dose AT7519M . Patients preexist peripheral neuropathy ( sensory and/or pain ) &gt; grade 2 . Patients uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) and/or autoimmune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) require active treatment .</criteria>
