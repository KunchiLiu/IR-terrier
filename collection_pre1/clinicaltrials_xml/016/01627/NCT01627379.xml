	<brief_summary>More 50 % patient esophageal cancer locally advance metastatic disease presentation . The use chemotherapy patient group increase intention local distant tumor control , improve quality life prolongation survival . Previous data suggest EGFR antibody target therapy may safely combine cisplatin 5-FU also may increase efficacy standard cisplatin / 5-FU regime . In present study , patient nonresectable , advanced metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer ( ESCC ) receive chemotherapy chemotherapy plus panitumumab every 3 week disease progression occur . The primary objective demonstrate superiority 5-FU , Cisplatin Panitumumab 5-FU Cisplatin alone term overall survival esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More 50 % patient esophageal cancer locally advance metastatic disease presentation . The use chemotherapy patient group increase intention local distant tumor control , improve quality life prolongation survival . The frequently use agent 5-fluorouracil , cisplatin , without various anthracyclines . Cisplatin plus continuous 5-fluorouracil standard care regimens . Taxanes anthracyclins eligible agent possible future study , however high incidence toxicity life threaten complication . Response rate single agent range 15 % -30 % . Combination regimens usually tend produce high response rate occasionally patient achieve complete response ( 0 % -11 % ) . However , combination regimen , median survival time remain clearly less 10 month , mostly 4-8 month [ Homs MY et al ] . In comparison different chemotherapy protocol , consistent benefit specific chemotherapy regimen . So far , cisplatin combine 5-fluorouracil one approve standard regimen esophageal cancer world wide [ Medical Research Council Oesophageal Cancer Group ] . This call three-weekly MRC regimen well toxicity profile four weekly CF regimen give Central Europe high Cisplatin dose [ Lorenzen S et al ] , less overall chemotherapy give per 4 month . Advances molecular biology new molecular technology possibly contribute improvement response neoadjuvant palliative therapy ESCC patient well . EGFR1 blockade platinum-based chemotherapy already significantly improve response rate well progression-free overall survival compare chemotherapy alone patient head neck tumor , also squamous cancer [ Vermorken JB et al ] . Even , Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie ( AIO ) perform randomized phase II study EGFR antibody cetuximab plus cisplatin/5-fluorouracil versus cisplatin/5-fluorouracil alone first-line metastatic ESCC [ Lorenzen S et al ] . For maximum six 28-day cycle , patient receive cisplatin 100 mg/m ( 2 ) , day 1 , plus 5-FU 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) day 1-5 ( CF ) , either alone combination cetuximab ( CET-CF ) . The primary endpoint tumor response . From 62 eligible patient include , 32 receive CET-CF 30 CF . Cetuximab weekly exacerbate grade 3/4 toxicity , except rash ( 6 % vs 0 % ) diarrhea ( 16 % vs 0 % ) . The overall response rate accord RECIST criterion 19 % 13 % disease control rate , 75 % 57 % CET-CF CF arm , respectively . With median follow-up 21.5 month , median progression-free survival 5.9 3.6 month median overall survival 9.5 5.5 month CET-CF CF , respectively . No KRAS codon 12/13 tumor mutation identify 37 evaluated sample . Thus , respect AIO data concordance head neck data Vermorken , EGFR antibody target therapy may safely combine CF , may also likely increase efficacy standard CF , particularly regard chosen primary endpoint overall survival . Therefore , aim study investigate overall survival patient squamous cell carcinoma esophagus prolong panitumumab added standard CF chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
