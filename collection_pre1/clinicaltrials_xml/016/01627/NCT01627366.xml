	<brief_summary>Improvements early detection successful treatment breast cancer lead steady rise number breast cancer ( BC ) survivor . With many individual live extend period diagnosis , Institute Medicine ( IOM ) recommend implementation treatment summary survivorship care plan ( TSSPs ) mechanism improve ongoing clinical coordination care , address immediate post-treatment long-term effect cancer treatment , include ongoing psychosocial burden cancer diagnosis . The need TSSPs also strongly advocated American Society Clinical Oncology 's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative TSSPs include recently introduce Comprehensive Cancer Improvement Act ( H.R . 1844 ) . This one first randomize control trial test efficacy TSSPs . The investigator recruit 500 low income , medically underserved woman two county public hospital , LAC+USC Medical Center Harbor-UCLA Medical Center , 10-24 month breast cancer diagnosis participation randomize control trial ( RCT ) design test efficacy TSSPs . The investigator randomize woman one two group : 1 ) control condition usual medical care 2 ) experimental condition control condition + tailor TSSP + 1 face-to-face nurse counseling session , cancer specialist primary care physician record also receive TSSP cover letter suggest clinically utilize . The investigator specific aim assess compare experimental control group follow primary outcome one year post-intervention : 1 ) discussion implementation recommend breast cancer survivorship care , include surveillance evaluation management BC treatment-related symptom , 2 ) patient satisfaction survivorship communication care , 3 ) pertinent aspects health-related quality life , , 4 ) ass cost-consequences experimental intervention . This study provide unique opportunity ass efficacy TSSPs low-income , underserved population BC survivor know high risk poorer long-term outcome , include mental health , quality life , recurrence mortality , therefore allow u demonstrate great possible benefit intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Survivorship Care Plans Outcomes Underserved Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , 11 million cancer survivor United States . Among survivor , breast cancer ( BC ) common , BC survivor account 23 % ( approximately 2.5 million ) . A 2006 report Institute Medicine ( IOM ) , From Cancer Patient Cancer Survivor : Lost Transition , provide comprehensive assessment health need cancer survivor include recommendation implementation treatment summary survivorship care plan ( TSSPs ) promote coordinate care cancer survivor address immediate post-treatment long-term effect cancer treatment include ongoing psychosocial burden cancer diagnosis , well potential later sequelae treatment . Because ever increase number BC survivor , fact 98 % patient local stage 84 % patient regional stage survive least 5 year diagnosis , multimodal nature BC treatment , provide mechanism summarizes , monitor coordinate BC follow-up care treatment essential . The use TSSPs also strongly advocated American Society Clinical Oncology 's ( ASCO ) - Quality Oncology Practice Initiative TSSPs include recently introduce Comprehensive Cancer Improvement Act 2009 ( H.R . 1844 ) . Further , apparent patient strongly desire write follow-up plan treatment end . The IOM recommend research undertaken evaluate impact cost plan . To knowledge , however , randomize control trial TSSPs evaluation cost-effectiveness conduct low-income , medically underserved population . In proposed study , recruit 500 low income , medically underserved woman two county public hospital , Los Angeles County + University Southern California Medical Center ( LAC+USC Medical Center ) Harbor-UCLA Medical Center , 10-24 month breast cancer diagnosis participation randomize control trial ( RCT ) design test efficacy TSSPs . The intervention deliver collection pre-intervention ( baseline ) measure . We consent randomize woman one two group : 1 ) control condition usual medical care 2 ) experimental condition usual medical care + tailor material include TSSP + 1 face-to-face nurse counseling session , cancer specialist primary care physician record also receive TSSP cover letter suggest clinically utilize . The study provide unique opportunity ass feasibility clinical utility tailor treatment summary survivorship care plan vulnerable population BC survivor know high risk poorer long-term outcome , include mental health , quality life , BC recurrence mortality , therefore allow u obtain great possible effect size intervention . We conduct randomize controlled trial test efficacy Treatment Summaries Survivorship Care Plans accompany nurse counseling . The TSSP consist 4 section : 1 ) breast cancer treatment summary 2 ) cognitively appropriate survivorship care plan include recommendation follow-up breast cancer care patient physician , 3 ) special section target towards physician , 4 ) list local national patient resource . Those woman consent participate pre-intervention measure collect ( i.e. , baseline interview ) randomize either usual care condition experimental condition . Individuals experimental group participate face-to-face session train , bilingual nurse review content TSSP . Follow-up measure participant collect 12-months delivery intervention . We evaluate receipt recommend breast cancer survivorship care , patient self-efficacy satisfaction communication provider , health relate quality life , cost-effectiveness intervention . In addition , participant control group receive write copy individualize TSSP completion study .</detailed_description>
