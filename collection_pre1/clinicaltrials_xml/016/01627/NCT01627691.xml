	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subject ≥70 year age Subject document calcific native aortic valve stenosis Subject document aortic annulus size ≥19 ≤27 mm base preprocedure diagnostic imaging Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis NYHA Functional Class ≥ II Subject consider high risk surgical valve replacement Heart team assessment subject likely benefit valve replacement . Subject ( legal representative ) understand study requirement treatment procedure , provide write informed consent . Subject , family member , and/or legal representative agree ( ) subject capable return study hospital require schedule follow visit . Subject congenital unicuspid bicuspid aortic valve . Subject acute myocardial infarction within 30 day index procedure Subject cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month , permanent neurologic defect prior study enrollment . Subject dialysis serum creatinine level &gt; 3.0 mg/dL 265 µmol/L . Subject preexist prosthetic heart valve ( aortic mitral ) prosthetic ring position . subject moderate mitral , aortic tricuspid regurgitation Subject need emergency surgery reason . Subject history endocarditis within 12 month index procedure evidence active systemic infection sepsis . Subject echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation . Subject low Hgb , platelet count &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 , low white blood cell count . Subject require chronic anticoagulation therapy tolerate concomitant therapy either aspirin clopidogrel/ticlopidine Subject active peptic ulcer disease gastrointestinal bleed within past 3 month , bleed diathesis coagulopathy refuse transfusion . Subject know hypersensitivity contrast agent adequately premedicated , know hypersensitivity aspirin , thienopyridines , heparin , nickel , tantalum , titanium , polyurethane . Subject life expectancy le 12 month due noncardiac , comorbid condition base assessment investigator time enrollment . Subject hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . Subject therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure within 30 day prior index procedure ( except pacemaker implantation allow ) . Subject untreated coronary artery disease . Subject document left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % . Subject cardiogenic shock hemodynamic instability require inotropic support mechanical support device . Subject severe peripheral vascular disease symptomatic carotid vertebral disease . Narrow Femoral artery lumen preclude use either Lotus device size , severe iliofemoral tortuosity calcification would prevent safe placement introducer sheath . Current problem substance abuse ( e.g. , alcohol , etc. ) . Subject participate another investigational drug device study reach primary endpoint . Patient preexist untreated conduction system disorder require new pacemaker implantation .</criteria>
