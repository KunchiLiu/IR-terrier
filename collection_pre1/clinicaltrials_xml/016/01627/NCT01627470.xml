	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate accuracy continuous non-invasive AP monitoring ( CNAP ) compare simultaneous IBP measurement intensive care patient undergo transport ambulance car . Since CNAP finger blood pressure calibrate NBP level , systematic bias IBP CNAP describe recent FDA meta analysis [ ] expect . The important factor CNAP system performance ability accurately track blood pressure change . Thus , purpose investigation show bias CNAP IBP fall within expect range blood pressure alteration detect instantaneously . The endpoint study : - The agreement systolic , diastolic mean CNAP IBP reading determine beat-to-beat basis : - Takeover patient intensive care unit , - Transport patient intensive care unit ambulance car - Transport patient ambulance car - The agreement systolic , diastolic mean CNAP IBP blood pres-sure change determine beat-to-beat basis : - Takeover patient intensive care unit , - Transport patient intensive care unit ambulance car - Transport patient ambulance car The beat-to-beat reading CNAP IBP automatically record electronically memory card transport monitor . CNAP data additionally record directly CNAP Monitor memory stick . Safety assess clinical observation well adverse event ( AE ) recording .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Continuous Non-invasive Pressure Device Versus Invasive Pressure Measurement During Prehospital Emergency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arterial pressure ( AP ) one important physiological variable . Particularly emergency medicine , AP need monitor repeatedly even well , continuously . This usually do use oscillometric pressure device ( NIBP ) . A number study emphasise importance continuous AP monitoring 20 % hypotensive episode may miss NIBP another 20 % detected delay . Prolonged hypotension precede 56 % perioperative cardiac arrest associate significant increase 1-year mortality rate , indicate NBP monitoring especially patient cardiovascular disease might insufficient independent clinical setting . Recently , monitor continuous non-invasive AP monitoring ( CNAPâ„¢ Monitor 500 ) introduce . It show procedure high risk hypotension NIBP miss significant hypotensive episode CNAP . At moment evidence performance CNAP preclinical emergency medicine . The evaluation gold standard invasive pressure measurement study help u evaluate performance CNAP preclinical setting .</detailed_description>
