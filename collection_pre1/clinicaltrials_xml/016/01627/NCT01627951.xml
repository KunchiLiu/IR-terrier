	<brief_summary>An effective vaccine malaria urgently need combat scourge disease . Before candidate vaccine test endemic country , first test human volunteer so-called Controlled Human Malaria Infections ( CHMI 's ) . Ideally , candidate vaccine test multiple strain malaria , representative disease 's global distribution . To date , however , one strain ( NF54 ) broadly use CHMI 's . The purpose study compare course infection 2 novel malaria strain NF54 human volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Plasmodium Falciparum Isolates Controlled Human Malaria Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) malaria remain responsible intolerable burden morbidity worldwide effective vaccine sorely need aid control effort . Before candidate malaria vaccine enter full-scale ( phase IIb ) field trial endemic area , must first test controlled circumstance ( phase IIa ) clinical human malaria infection study . Since Pf isolate display wide genetic diversity across globe , phase IIa challenge infection conduct homologous heterologous strain . Since 1998 highly successful Controlled Human Malaria Infection model UMC St Radboud , Nijmegen , The Netherlands , employ test candidate vaccine answer fundamental question pathophysiological immunological mechanism early Pf infection human volunteer . To date largely NF54 strain P. falciparum use Nijmegen model , extensive experience meanwhile acquire . In order increase portfolio Pf strain available future phase IIa study , first necessary document detail parasitological , clinical immunological characteristic new candidate strain control human malaria infection . In study , strain NF135 NF166 compare regard well-characterised NF54 strain .</detailed_description>
