	<brief_summary>The peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common atherosclerotic disease manifestation prevalence increase age simultaneous presence cardiovascular risk factor . PAD patient usually treat , first line treatment , exercise therapy , combine pharmacological antiplatelet therapy . In case first line therapy failure , PAD patient usually undergo invasive revascularization procedure . After peripheral stent locate , major follow-up problem restenosis rate . Published study describe , large amount patient , recognise high residual platelet activity . These data PAD patient moment lack . The author would evaluate incidence PAD patient high residual platelet activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common atherosclerotic disease manifestation prevalence increase age co-presence cardiovascular risk factor . PAD affect large proportion adult population , age-adjusted prevalence 4-15 % increase 29 % case comorbidity presence diabetes mellitus individual . Less 20 % patient peripheral arterial lament typical symptom `` claudication intermittens '' . Studies symptomatic PAD natural history indicate risk limb loss non-diabetic patient low ( 2 % less ) , cardiovascular disease represent lead cause death ; annual rate cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke cardiovascular death ) 5 7 % . Medical treatment / surgery type patient direct improve walk autonomy also reduce cardiovascular risk . Claudicant patient first-line therapy base structured physical exercise program , specific case , antiplatelet pharmacological therapy . The lack response exercise / drug therapy lead next level decision making , consider limb revascularization procedure . However , patient suspect proximal lesion ( gluteal claudication absent femoral pulse ) , revascularization procedure could consider first line therapy . When revascularization procedure consider , first choice intervention endovascular strategy , consider low number periprocedural complication . Recommendations optimal drug therapy revascularisation procedure low limb hamper lack agreement optimal role procedure , lack data randomize clinical trial . Transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) , primary associate stenting , recommend focal stenotic lesion iliac ( common external first section ) femoral-popliteal axis , particularly claudication intermittents consider severe , rather critical ischemia . Also , approach recommend non-diabetic patient relatively preserve tibial vessel flow . Exists minor agreement endovascular procedure use extended occlusive lesion . In recent year , become common use open cover stent endovascular treatment order make secure durable time , especially obstructive extended lesion . This certainly lead improve primary patency outcome , entail still entail additional problem drug therapy agreement . Nowadays , main problem concern low limbs revascularization post-procedure anti-thrombotic pharmacological treatment different antiplatelet drug effectiveness This issue address two meta-analyses , show data conclusive . Moreover , recent study Marcucci et al ( Circulation . 2009 ; 119 : 237-42 ) clearly show impaired platelet activation inhibition crucial point prevention vascular outcome , residual platelet reactivity associate adverse vascular outcome . Overall , data identify two key issue : 1 . Platelet hyperactivation , usually observe revascularization procedure ; 2 . The platelet inhibition percentage appear crucial reduce postoperative thrombotic complication restenosis early onset . Therefore , unique aspect study analyze whether peripheral revascularization procedure platelet hyperactivation observe evaluate possible involved mechanism . In fact , knowledge underlie mechanism could lead appropriate pharmacological approach prevent platelet activation . In context , author would explore role reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) induce platelet activation patient PAD undergo revascularization device .</detailed_description>
