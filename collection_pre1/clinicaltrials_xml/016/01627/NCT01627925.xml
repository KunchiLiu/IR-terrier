	<detailed_description>Upper airway obstruction ( UAO ) unpredictable frequently occur complication induction general anesthesia . Since obese patient ( BMI &gt; 30 km/ m2 ) vulnerable develop airway obstruction either sleep anesthesia , segment obese individual entire population keep growing , difficult airway management anesthesia become even challenging ever . The serious event relate difficult airway management anesthesia `` intubate , ventilate '' . Unfortunately , even modern technologic advance , 16 % death permanent brain damage related anesthesia attribute failure difficult airway management 3 . The American Society Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) close claim analysis anesthesia complication indicate difficult airway one challenge scenario continuously face anesthesia provider . Indeed , fatal complication general anesthesia . Therefore , measure use reduce incidence difficult airway anesthesia remain improved . The mechanism UAO anesthesia well understood . Posterior displacement soft palate , tongue epiglottis believe primary contributing factor . Obesity well know essential characteristic reflect propensity UAO . Accordingly , obese patient high-risk group perioperative airway catastrophe prone develop progressively narrow pharyngeal airway due increase soft tissue volume surround pharyngeal airway . More evidence indicate mechanism UAO anesthesia share many similarity upper airway obstruction observe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) via nasal mask ( NM ) maintain airway patent near 100 % success patient OSA , tolerate . Under anesthesia , tolerance issue patient anesthetize . Obesity major risk factor obstructive sleep apnea obese patient higher prevalence UAO anesthesia . Therefore , investigator hypotheses nCPAP eliminate airway obstruction obese patient anesthesia . The investigator propose test hypothesis determine efficacy nCPAP maintain airway patency obese patient require general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
