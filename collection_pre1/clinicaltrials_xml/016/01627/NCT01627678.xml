	<brief_summary>Background : Despite introduction highly effective antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimes , control HIV infection result increase CD4 cell count undetectable viral load , many patient suffer increased morbidity . There evidence presence antibody C5 region gp120 strongly correlate slow disease progression , loss antibody responses region associate progression . Investigational product : Vacc-C5 single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine correspond C5 region gp120 external domain gp41 . The vaccine intend create non-neutralizing antibody C5 region . Study objectives : 1 . To evaluate safety vaccination regimens 2 . To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune response ( antibody ) , T cell response , T cell activation marker immune marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Despite introduction highly effective antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimes , control HIV infection result increase CD4 cell count undetectable viral load , many patient suffer increased morbidity . There evidence presence antibody C5 region gp120 strongly correlate slow disease progression , loss antibody responses region associate progression . Investigational product : Vacc-C5 single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine correspond C5 region gp120 external domain gp41 . The rationale behind Vacc-C5 find long-term non-progressors ( LTNP ) subject antibodies towards C5 part gp120 HIV infect subject rapid disease progression . The primary objective Vacc-C5 immunotherapy induce humoral immune response . The vaccine intend create non-neutralizing antibody C5 region thereby mimic natural process HIV-infected long-term non-progressors ( LTNP ) subject . Use adjuvant : Peptide vaccine poorly immunogenic . To induce measurable level T helper cell type 1 ( Th1 ) type 2 ( Th2 ) immune response peptide , adjuvant often require . Two different adjuvant use study : 1 . GM-CSF facilitates dendritic cell maturation migration lymph node antigen presentation . The regimen use adjuvant intradermal administration . 2 . Aluminum-containing adjuvant well know . They administer human being animal million dos vaccine . This type vaccine usually administer intramuscularly subcutaneously . In study intramuscular administration use . Primary objective : It evaluate safety Vacc-C5 three different dose level give intradermally GM-CSF adjuvant give intramuscularly Alhydrogel adjuvant . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune response ( antibody ) . 2 . To evaluate C5-specific T cell response ELISPOT T cell proliferation . 3 . To evaluate T cell activation marker ( e.g . CD38 , HLA-DR ) immune marker . Study design : The study open , dose-escalating , single centre study HIV-positive subject treatment ( ART ) . Two different vaccine regimen test : 1 . Arm A : Vacc-C5 GM-CSF adjuvant administer intradermally . 2 . Arm B : Vacc-C5 Alhydrogel adjuvant administer intramuscularly . Three dose level Vacc-C5 ( 100 , 300 900 microgram test two vaccination regimen . A dose escalation design ( 3+3 ) use , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) detect 18 subject include arm . Subjects HIV-positive stable ART last 6 month CD4 cell count ≥400x 10 6 /L meet inclusion exclusion criterion eligible study . The duration study 26 week plus screening period 12 week . During Treatment Period , subject remain ART receive three immunization ; Weeks 1 , 2 4 , Vacc C5 include either GM-CSF Alhydrogel adjuvant . The study sequential , mean first three subject arm receive low dose ( three subject ) 100 µg Vacc-C5 . If dose limit toxicity detect week 4 vaccination , three subject add next dose level start .</detailed_description>
