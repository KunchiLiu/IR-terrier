	<detailed_description>Website development : The www.nmac.in.th website contains learn courseware database . The program interactive , personal file student along detail like code , password , name , surname , date-month-year , test score , log-in period time . Students , , plan learn subject ; free record copy article website . There log-in limit place internet connection around clock . Learning courseware : We develop set learn courseware specify topic activity diagnostic test arterial blood gas ( ABGs ) . The activity cover topic table specification , whereas diagnostic test probe weaknesses student ' understanding activity ass learn skill analytical think patient ' problem assort circumstance face clinical practice . Each set courseware contain three level : beginner , intermediate , advance . Students required pass orderly way , least minimum score 80 % advance next level . Once pass certain courseware , free review learn courseware often want . Learning source : Interactive student , program identifies learn weakness avoid give direct answer immediately test . What instead link student begin search well-prepared content , contain detail subject . Construction test form : Pre-test post-test form design parallel table specification , thus prevent carry-over effect test three week afterward alternate question change . The test underwent verification content validity index item objective congruence ( IOC ) determine four clinical expert . Deciding whether test behavioral objective align , set IOCs 0.79 pre-tests 0.73 post-tests . - Two set pre-tests post-tests 10 question , question contain four sub-items require short answer - 15 activity 10 diagnostic test multiple-choice ( 4 ) question System test : We introduce element , namely learn courseware , test , source learning , develop system test research development approach , logical approach , empirical approach . Different sample size use , logical comment analyze test system efficiency three stage : First-stage system development assessment : - The sample group 4 sixth year medical student underwent system test three-week period - Objectives : - To test system operate unit system log-ins - To test objectivity tool - Findings : - The system operate unit flexible student ' interactive behavior , instruction responsiveness , network connection . Access system website provide ready access information , user-friendly , stable . - The tool objective , cover complete detail , clear , element subject content proper order . - Improvement : - Making system interactive network ; focus conciseness ; add channel answer questionnaire website ; add record downloading article website ; notifying student performance test , question question ; enable website accommodate le 100 concurrent user . - Adjustment font match general personal-computer set update word question relevant circumstance patient . Second-stage system development assessment : - The sample group 32 nurse anesthetist student 21 first year resident anesthesiology underwent system test three-week period . - Objectives - To test criterion-referenced tool quality - To determine learn achievement - Findings : - The pre-test post-test register 0.48 0.50 item difficulty ( p ) value ; 0.72 0.73 sensitivity index ( ) ; 0.85 0.88 content validity ; concurrent validity calculation Pearson Product moment standard test 0.82 ; 0.91 reliability internal consistency Kuder-Richardson method 20 . - The diagnostic test register 0.87 , 0.91 , 0.87 0.93 , 0.93 , 0.86 item difficulty ( p ) value ; 0.17 , 0.11 , 0.20 0.15 , 0.08 , 0.21 sensitivity index ; 0.89 , 0.80 , 0.95 content validity ; 0.85 , 0.66 , 0.95 0.91 , 0.77 , 0.88 reliability internal consistency . - Learning achievement : - The post-test score full mark 40 , significantly high pre-test score : 4.52 ± 3.04 23.90 ± 7.69 among nurse student group 7.60 ± 5.69 26.96 ± 7.47 among resident group . - Improvement : We choose quality test question introduce 'distracters ' often picked respondent pre-test post-test develop test target group . Third-stage development assessment : Consisting trial application target preclinical 3rd year medical student nurse critical care unit throughout country volunteer join study . They ask log website study require subject three week . Students ' profile periodically update .</detailed_description>
