	<brief_summary>Aim The purpose study evaluate whether fuel subsidy reduce exacerbation COPD among people age 55 , therefore whether provide subsidy cost-beneficial policy initiative . The Warm Homes Elder New Zealanders Study enrol community-dwelling people age 55 moderate bad COPD . Prior study commence house insulate ( feasible , &amp; house-owner agree ) . Data collect health energy use participant . The household randomly assign `` early '' intervention group subsidy power account first winter study . The subsidy intervention design enable participant , chose , keep house warm winter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Warm Homes Elder New Zealanders ( WHEZ ) Background Although considerable recent work prevention , management cause Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , contribution housing well research . This despite socio-economic patterning COPD ( Maori woman high rate COPD record group woman ) , relationship socio-economic deprivation housing condition . It likely improve heating would reduce exacerbation COPD : - COPD patient advanced disease tend old people often live fix income may unable afford adequate heat - There high excess winter hospitalisation COPD patient indicate COPD exacerbation may trigger cold condition . - About one third exacerbation COPD trigger respiratory infection . - The Housing , Insulation Health Study demonstrate reduction self-reported respiratory disease house insulate . Therefore improve heat household COPD patient may reduce respiratory infection turn would reduce number severity exacerbation . The percentage people 65 New Zealand increase 12 % 22 % next 25 year . Therefore become increasingly important find cost-effective way reduce morbidity old age group . As COPD significant cause morbidity amongst old people , study investigates potentially cost effective intervention reduce likelihood expensive hospital stay improve quality life old people . Aim To evaluate whether fuel subsidy reduce exacerbation COPD among people age 55 , therefore whether provide subsidy cost-beneficial policy initiative . Potential Benefits The potential benefit study include reduce burden disease . The patient caregiver may experience improve quality life . Hospitals may experience few patient require treatment winter . A cost-benefit analysis quantify benefit .</detailed_description>
