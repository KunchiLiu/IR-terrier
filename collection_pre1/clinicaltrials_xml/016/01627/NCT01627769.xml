	<brief_summary>It well document follow thermal burn injury development hypertrophic scar keloid ( HSK ) range 40 90 % . hand It well document cryosurgery wound generally heal minimal tissue contraction , result good cosmetic result minimal complication . The Aim study To specify burn cryosurgery blister fluid protein , cytokine cell To compare data regard possible protein , cytokine cell , regard possible effect scar wound heal . Also Identify component present cryosurgery blister might anti-scarring effect characterize biochemically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Skin frequently injure tissue , million people worldwide acquire scar every year . Clinical experience show patient want less noticeable scar , color texture closely resemble normal skin . Few human reach adulthood without experience wound skin result scar . Scars range fine line raise , hard , red , pruritic painful hypertrophic keloid scar , severely disfigure cause significant morbidity . In addition physical complication , appearance scar major concern physicians patient . Published literature show wide demographic group , across gender , age , ethnicity geographical region , similar concern scar patient , particular , value even small improvement scar . It well establish severe disfigure scarring associate significant psychological stress impairment quality life . It well document follow thermal burn injury development hypertrophic scar keloid ( HSK ) range 40 90 % . In second degree burn exudate accumulate locally epidermis dermis skin , form blister . Burn exudate ( blister ) form result change capillary permeability damage agent locally affect capillary , generally inflammatory reaction . The chemical composition exudate like plasma , protein concentration depend degree damage capillary . Further , exudate contains material damage disintegrated cell protein degradation product , enzyme etc . By puncture blister possible follow change content heal process . Only study publish medical literature blister fluid composition evaluate follow second degree burn . Nanto Viljanto 1962 first publish chemical composition blister fluid . They demonstrate albumin-globulin ratio , phosphorus content quantity purine pyrimidine derivative blister fluid indicator local severity second degree burn . Heggers et al 1980 find blister fluid , follow burn , contain substance find body , include parenterally administer penicillin . In addition elevation potassium cation anion imbalance primarily due Na/K cellular pump malfunction , destruction permeability cell membrane likely direct result complement cellular enzyme , include prostaglandin thromboxane . Elevated SGOT , CPK , LDH enzymes indicate severe trauma cell . The presence immunoglobulins indicate high molecular-weight protein diffuse equally well edematous phase . In 1986 Deitch et al . study early protein alteration blister fluid serum associate burn injury . It find local change blister fluid may adversely affect local immunity predispose patient burn wound sepsis . Lately , significant improvement protein identification employ proteomic profile technology document . The model use suction blister fluid compare protein expression pathological skin condition psoriasis toxic epidermal necrolysis . However , evaluation blister fluid component cutaneous scar investigate . In 1982 , Shepherd Dawber first apply cryosurgery monotherapy regimen treat Hypertrophic scar keloid ( HSK ) . Mende , Zouboulis Orfanos others show repeated surface/spray cryosurgical session beneficial effect HSK ( 68 % - 81 % remission ) , almost recurrence ( 2 % ) . Recently , intralesional cryosurgery technology develop treat HSK ( CryoShape , Etgar Group International Ltd. , Kefar Saba , Israel approve Israel ministry Health ) ( 14-21 ) . A specially design cryoneedle insert core HSK maximize volume HSK frozen . The cryoneedle connect adaptor cryogun fill liquid nitrogen , introduce cryoprobe thereby freeze HSK . After HSK completely frozen , cryoprobe defrosts withdraw . Following cryotreatment blister form . It demonstrate average 51 % scar volume reduction achieve follow single intralesional cryosurgery treatment . Specifically , auricular lobular HSK average volume reduction 67 % upper back shoulder HSK 60 % . These obtain clinical result significant superior treatment modality exist now-days treat HSK . Scientific study execute follow intralesional cryosurgery treatment demonstrate rejuvenation treat scar , i.e. , parallelization , organize architecture collagen fiber compare pre-treated scar . In addition , histological analysis reveal intralesional cryosurgery collagen bundle lose swirl structure , thickness collagen layer decrease , bundle become compact less space fiber . A clear distinct transition zone separate treat unaffected area . The frozen tissue devoid proliferate cell mast cell whereas number blood vessel remain unaltered . Most fibroblast express test myofibroblast marker although exclusively express one . Almost mast cell find follow cryo-treatment . Thus , Intralesional cryosurgery treatment result major change collagen structure organization . In addition , treatment reduce number proliferate cell general myofibroblasts mast cell particular . It well document cryosurgery wound generally heal minimal tissue contraction , result good cosmetic result minimal complication . However , follow extensive medical literature search evident evaluation blister fluid component follow skin cryosurgery treatment HSK yet study well specific evaluation post-cryosurgery blister component cutaneous scarring/anti-scarring effect .</detailed_description>
