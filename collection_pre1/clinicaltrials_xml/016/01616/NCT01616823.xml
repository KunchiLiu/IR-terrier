	<detailed_description>In developed country , HIV infection consider chronic disease thus life expectancy people infect HIV approach general population . Therefore many HIV positive woman choose pursue pregnancy . An important concern antenatal intrapartum management decrease risk vertical transmission . With use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) intrapartum IV zidovudine ( ZDV ) risk transmission decrease significantly , however debate surround optimal mode delivery . Possible mechanisms lead perinatal transmission include transfusion mother 's blood fetus labour contraction , infection rupture membrane direct contact fetus infect secretion blood maternal genital tract . When maternal viral load detectable , The Society Obstetricians Gynaecologists Canada ( SOGC ) govern body recommend elective cesarean section perform delivery 12-fold increase risk perinatal transmission . However , evidence suggest woman low risk transmission , undetectable viral load HAART , benefit transmission reduction provide cesarean section may negligible . The question length time rupture membrane prior delivery transmission risk source controversy , especially context woman suppressive therapy ( HAART ) undetectable viral load . Traditional thinking state length time rupture membrane longer 4 hour , benefit cesarean section lose time . However , think base data maternal viral load know intrapartum IV ZDV use . Many practitioner believe woman undetectable viral load , virally suppressed HAART , safe route delivery vaginal , irrespective length time rupture membrane . This retrospective cohort study plan examine mode delivery median length time rupture membrane HIV positive woman two downtown academic institution Toronto .</detailed_description>
