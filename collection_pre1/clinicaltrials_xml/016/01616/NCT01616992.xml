	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) cause severe bladder pain extensive disability large group woman int prime productive life . Extensive study bladder uncover many abnormality , investigator know cause result disorder . None lead real long-term progress treatment , far . The investigator find autonomic disorder often occur patient family member patient IC/PBS . The investigator therefore propose determine whether main abnormality IC/PBS actually lie autonomic nervous system , rather bladder . The investigator careful measurement autonomic function sensation patient IC/PBS , rest , control psychological stress . The investigator compare measurement patient myofascial pelvic pain , know abnormality truly link IC/PBS , simply reflect presence pelvic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interstitial Cystitis : Elucidation Psychophysiologic Autonomic Characteristics ( ICEPAC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator primary hypothesis IC/PBS member large family disorder share aberrant central autonomic sensory response stress , pain threat . These disorder appear share common vulnerability seem confer development , symptom disorder usually first manifest response environmental trigger . This proposal aim compare neural , psychological , endocrine phenotype characterize patient IC/PBS patient suffer myofascial pelvic pain ( MPP ) syndrome , chronic pelvic pain distinct IC/PBS , age-matched , healthy control , first degree relative . These study design identify level neuraxis impair , basal state , response well-characterized psychosocial stressor . Aim 1 : To differentiate specific baseline neurophysiological abnormality occur IC/PBS present patient MPP healthy subject , specifically : 1a : Bladder pelvic floor afferent efferent urogynecological function : ( 1 ) void diary ( efferent ) modify include void-state related numeric rating scale pain ( afferent ) ; Uroflow measurement ( efferent ) , double-blind placebo-controlled evaluation diagnostic lidocaine instillation test ( afferent ) impact void function ( efferent ) ; ( 2 ) semi-quantitative evaluation pelvic floor function identification myofascial trigger point ( efferent ) , include inter-observer validation standardize semi-quantitative examination ( afferent ) ; ( 3 ) quantitative Q-tip test vulvodynia ( afferent ) ( 4 ) evaluation dysmenorrhea ( afferent ) menstrual function ( efferent ) . 1b : somatic afferent autonomic efferent neural function , specifically : ( 1 ) global screen autonomic neurological abnormality establish Small Fiber Score Instrument ( SFIBS ) questionnaire structure neurological examination ( afferent efferent ) ; ( 2 ) specific evaluation sacral lumbar nerve root function focus neurological examination ( afferent efferent ) ; ( 3 ) parasympathetic cardiac function cardiac response deep breathing ( efferent ) ; ( 4 ) sympathetic cardiac vasomotor function cardiovascular response Valsalva maneuver upright tilt table test ( efferent ) ; ( 5 ) sudomotor sympathetic function quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test ( QSART ) evaluate post-ganglionic function ( specifically abnormal autonomic neuropathy ) thermoregulatory sweat test ( efferent ) . 1. c : gastrointestinal afferent efferent function , specifically upper bowel motility establish method : ( 1 ) early satiety &amp; gastric compliance water load test ( afferent ) . ( 2 ) gastric electrical activity electrogastrography ( efferent ) . Aim 2 : To determine specific developmental , psychiatric , pain , autonomic , stress response characteristic common IC/PBS family member , differ MPP healthy subject : 2. : Stress trauma history early childhood adulthood . 2b : Psychiatric screen psychometric quantitation psychological symptom , pain function . 2c : Quantitation associate co-morbid autonomic disorder ODYSA questionnaire . 2d : Salivary cortisol level immediately prior autonomic testing ( anticipatory stress ) period relaxation test finish , conjunction stress self-assessment inventory . 2e : Performance Trier test subset patient control , measurement autonomic cardiovascular parameter , body temperature , catecholamine concentration ( norepinephrine , epinephrine , dopamine ) endocrine parameter : ACTH adrenocortical hormone .</detailed_description>
