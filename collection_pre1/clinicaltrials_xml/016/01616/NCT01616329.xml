	<brief_title>R-FACT Study : Risk Factors Alloimmunization After Red Blood Cell Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Individuals expose red blood cell ( RBC ) alloantigens transfusion , pregnancy , transplantation may produce antibody alloantigens express RBCs . Although incidence event debate range percentages 1-6 % single transfuse patient 30 % poly-transfused patient ( e.g . sickle cell disease , thalassemia myelodysplasia ) , pose serious clinical problem delay haemolytic reaction well logistic problem e.g . obtain timely properly match transfusion blood patient new alloantibody detect . Rationale : It know risk recipient develop antibody depend dose route administration immunogenicity antigen , well genetic acquire patient-related factor . The latter factor however ill define therefore hypothesize particular clinical condition ( e.g . use medication , concomitant infection , cellular immunity ) transfusion give may contribute risk immunization . Research objective : Examine association clinical , environmental genetic characteristic recipient erythrocyte transfusion risk immunization erythrocyte alloantigens expose transfusion episode . METHODOLOGY Study Design study population We perform retrospective match case- cohort study hospital nationwide period January 2005 December 2011 . Large red blood cell use hospital select study base . The study cohort comprise consecutive red blood cell transfuse patient study center . Cases define first time ever irregular red blood cell antibody former , prior history red blood cell transfusion alloimmunization study period . Controls consecutive transfuse patient receive first subsequent red blood transfusion study center prior history red blood cell transfusion alloimmunization . Observational study , well conduct , equipped examine interesting transfusion research question . With mind , choose case- cohort study design study . With help design , compare case occur red blood cell transfuse cohort randomly select sample cohort . Using approach , one give case , select 2 control least number transfusion case . This approach follow advantage : 1 . This ensure patient transfusion cohort high number transfusion equal chance pick control . In essence , member cohort similar transfusion risk ( alloimmunization ) point transfusion history select control . 2 . Cases also equal chance get select control case . This study design minimize selection bias , . Such study design allow u include number patient sufficient detect small effect adjust risk factor , well document potential risk factor extensively . Matching We take account number transfusion particular case receive uptil antibody form episode , match 2 case ( select per control ) number transfusion . To account inter- hospital difference nationwide , also match case control site/ study center . Implicated Period To examine immunomodulating clinical risk factor surround transfusion precede date alloantibody formation , define clinical risk period implicate period alloimmunization case would form irregular red blood cell antibody . This period would time ( day ) date first ever positive screen alloantibody calendar date 30 day positive screen . We also introduce lag period minimum 7 day first ever positive screen last ever transfusion ( implicate transfusion ) positive screen . ( Figure 2 ) This ensure patient 's immune system adequate time respond transfusion exposure . We define similar implicated period match control well , retrospectively `` implicate transfusion '' 30 calendar day back . First time form alloantibody Our endpoint case , first time form irregular red blood cell antibody define clinically significant antibody screen three cell serology panel 37 degree Celsius . All patient routinely screened alloantibody , repeat least every 72 hour , transfusion require . The antibody screen three cell panel include indirect antiglobulin test ( LISS Diamed ID gel system ) subsequently identify standard 11 cell panel gel system . Data acquirement , measurement handle Transfusion cohort data acquire hospital blood transfusion service site patient record . Second use data patient questionnaire . Thirdly , determine patient ' racial background blood include consent patient . 4.3.1 Patient Medical history record Potential clinical risk factor include haematological , oncological , surgical medicinal data well auto- immune disease related condition time implicate ( likely causal ) transfusion . Factors condition actively score , infection ( include causal microorganism ) active / chronic allergy ( include know antigen ) , fever , cytopenia ( ) , systemic inflammatory response ( clinical response ( non ) -specific insult either infectious noninfectious origin ) , peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation ( autologous allogenous ) , multi trauma , splenectomy , solid malignancy , autoimmune disorder ( rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 etc . ) , chemotherapy , immunosuppressive drug , cytostatics antibiotic study . Questionnaire Participants ask fill print questionnaire . The participant also option fill web-based questionnaire , accessible via link provide information letter . After identification control patient similar mail sent control Environmental life style factor like vaccination status , previous pregnancy case female , level education current profession ( proxy socio- economic status ) obtain via patient information questionnaire . The questionnaire add knowledge possible confounders case control . In general , many question involve `` life-time '' risk factor information particularly target time implicated episode . Racial confounder Based knowledge different ethnicity vary frequency erythrocyte antigen , so- call mismatch donor one particular ethnicity recipient another ethnicity play role develop immune response donor erythrocytes . Therefore , also attempt document racial mismatch lead red blood cell alloimmunization . This attempt one question questionnaire foremost rely blood group type usually determine ethnicity . Blood research sample To investigate effect genetic factor risk development alloantibody , collect blood sample participant extensively type blood get antigen profile look genetic marker influence immune system vaccination efficiency . SNP 's candidate gene ( e.g . cod HLA type ) modulate specific innate immune response assess . Biomarkers typical activity immune response : cytokine titre antibody common ( vaccinate ) antigens later determine plasma serum store well . Statistical analysis We expect include total 500 case patient 1000 control . Logistic regression model use assess association risk develop antibody potential risk factor , adjust risk factor number exposure antigen . We examine association risk factor alloimmunization use logistic regression . We also make selection case control frequently find antibody relative impact risk factor immune modulators risk antibody type ( separate analysis ) direction , make generalized observation . With 1500 patient , conventional 80 % power p-value 0.05 , able detect effect ( odds ratio ) dichotomize risk factor 1.35 high . An additional analysis perform along line `` case-crossover '' design within case patient . The `` Hazard Period '' ( time period right detection positive antibody ) compare `` Control Component '' ( specified time period Hazard Period ) case patient 's medical history risk ratio transient effect risk factor calculate .</detailed_description>
