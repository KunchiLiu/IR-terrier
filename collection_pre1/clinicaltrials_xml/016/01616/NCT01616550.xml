	<brief_title>Quality Postoperative Pain Management Following Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain expect outcome surgery . However , many patient experience suboptimally manage postoperative pain . Benefits adequate analgesia longer need demonstrate . Optimal analgesia lead faster recovery , reduces risk postoperative complication , enhance patient 's satisfaction quality life follow surgery . Currently , approximately 1000 thoracic surgery perform hospital annually . Many surgery previously require thoracotomy incision perform Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy Surgery ( VATS ) . Although VATS know less invasive cause less pain thoracotomy , patient still experience considerable pain follow thoracoscopy especially first hour follow surgery . Thoracic epidural emerge preferred pain control technique follow thoracotomy . However , role epidural analgesia thoracoscopy remain debatable . The ideal postoperative analgesia regimen short-duration intense pain related thoracoscopy elucidate . Paravertebral blockade alternative epidural analgesia . However , duration pain relief associate technique may vary 4 48 hour . Systemic opioids give patient-controlled device may use thoracic surgery analgesic effect limit undesirable side-effects may occur . This prospective observational study investigate quality pain management follow thoracic surgery ass patient 's nurse 's satisfaction regard pain relief teach hospital . Methods : Patients schedule elective thoracic surgery perform thoracotomy thoracoscopy consider prospective observational study . The surgical approach pain management plan modify patient 's participation study . According standard practice hospital , pain assess use Verbal Numeric Scale 0 10 . Type analgesic technique , consumption opioid non-opioid drug , type duration surgery note . Side-effects attributable analgesia associate treatment record . Length stay recovery room , step-down unit hospital also record . Postoperative complication assess . Patients invite complete short form `` Brief Pain Inventory '' . They ask grade satisfaction pain relief use scale 1 4 ( 1= unsatisfied , 4= satisfy ) . Nurses ask provide opinion patient 's pain relief , ability move collaboration .</detailed_description>
