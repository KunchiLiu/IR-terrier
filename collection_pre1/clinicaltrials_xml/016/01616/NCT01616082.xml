	<brief_title>Effect Caloric Restriction Fat Oxidation Obese Men Women ( Magellan II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study investigator examine hypothesis overweight/obese individual unable meet target weight loss goal low calorie diet ( LCD ) intrinsically less metabolically flexible weight-losing counterpart . The investigator expect 'inflexibility ' characterize impaired fat oxidation ( determined indirect calorimetry ) response caloric restriction . If case , subject may represent population 'super-responders ' likely demonstrate robust response approach increase fat oxidation . The investigator also measure lipid concentration skeletal muscle liver hydrogen 1 magnetic resonance ( 1H-MRS ) determine stability measurement well magnitude change see LCD .</detailed_description>
