	<brief_summary>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) characterize progressive cyst formation kidney , patient lead end stage renal disease . It common hereditary renal disease prevalence approximately 1 1,000 person . The majority patient also progressive cyst formation liver , lead pain , gastrointestinal discomfort sometimes need liver transplantation . At present proven therapeutic intervention slow rate disease progression human ADPKD . The development renoprotective treatment well tolerate , therefore major importance . In respect , somatostatin analogue promise especially polycystic liver disease , also renal phenotype . However , study perform thus far agent , underpowered short duration reach definitive conclusion potential reno- hepatoprotective efficacy somatostatin analogue . Therefore , present study design randomise clinical trial sufficient duration follow-up investigate whether somatostatin analogue Lanreotide slow progression polycystic kidney liver disease ADPKD-patients . To end , 300 ADPKD patient , age 18-60years , eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) randomize 1:1 standard care monthly subcutaneous lanreotide injection top standard care . These 300 subject go 15 study visit 3 year 1 follow visit . During visit , questionnaire fill , physical examination perform , blood drawn urine collect . After study completion , rate renal function decline lanreotide treat subject compare subject receive standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims : First , determine whether Lanreotide attenuate progression renal phenotype ADPKD patient measure change rate renal function decline change renal volume growth . Second , determine whether Lanreotide modify progression liver phenotype subset ADPKD patient moderate severe polycystic liver disease measure change liver volume . Methods : Investigator driven , randomize , multi-center , control clinical trial . Study population : 300 subject , diagnose ADPKD , base revise Ravine criterion , advance disease high likelihood rapid disease progression ( eGFR 30 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 age 18 60 year ) . Intervention : Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) two group . One group receive dose Lanreotide 120 mg sc every 28 day 30 month . The dose Lanreotide eGFR ( BSA unadjusted ) dependent . Subjects reach eGFR &lt; 30ml/min study receive Lanreotide 90 mg sc every 28 day . Down-titration also occur case dose relate side effect . The group patient receive standard care . Main study endpoint : Change renal function Lanreotide versus treat patient , assess slope serial eGFR measurement time treatment phase trial , value obtain month 3 first eGFR value slope analysis . Main secondary outcome variable : - determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression measure change renal volume overall study population , - determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression measure change liver volume subset ADPKD patient moderate severe polycystic liver disease - determine whether Lanreotide change quality life - determine whether Lanreotide well tolerate</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis ADPKD , base upon modify Ravine criterion 2 . Age 18 60 year . 3. eGFR ( MDRD ) 30 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 . 4 . Providing informed consent . 1 . Patients , opinion study investigator may present safety risk . 2 . Patients unlikely adequately comply trial 's procedure [ due instance medical condition likely require extend interruption discontinuation , history substance abuse noncompliance ) . 3. . Patients take medication concomitant illnesses likely confound endpoint assessment ( e.g . nephrotoxic medication chronic NSAID , cyclosporine , lithium immunosuppressant use ) b . Patients concomitant illness likely confound endpoint assessment ( e.g . diabetes mellitus medication need patient proteinuria &gt; 1 g /24hr ) . 4 . Patients underwent surgical drainage intervention cystic kidney disease year studyentry likely candidate procedure within 2 year start study . 5 . Patients take experimental ( i.e. , non approve FDA/EMA indication ADPKD ) therapy . 6 . Patients use Lanreotide ( another somatostatin analogue ) 3 month study start . 7 . Patients know intolerance Lanreotide ( another somatostatin analogue ) . 8 . Unwillingness comply reproductive precaution . Women capable become pregnant must willing comply approve birth control twoweeks prior , 60 day take investigational product . 9 . Women , pregnant breastfeeding . 10 . Patients , suffer cardiac arrhythmia , think dangerous combination lanreotide administration . 11 . Patients , ever suffer symptomatic gallstone undergo cholecystectomy . 12 . Patients , medical history pancreatitis . 13 . Patients , medical history infect liver cyst . In addition : Patients , underwent liver cyst drainage surgery year , enter study , assess change liver volume . Patients contraindication , interference MRI assessment , dictate local regulation , allow undergo MR imaging . However , patient enter study , assess change kidney and/or liver volume .</criteria>
