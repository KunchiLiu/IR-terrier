	<detailed_description>People CF ( cystic fibrosis ) often lung infection occur repeatedly worsen time . The lung infection often cause bacteria . Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) bacterium cause one consequential lung infection people CF . Many young child Pa lungs become infected get older . The investigator want learn Pa pass person person , especially someone CF . The respiratory secretion someone colonize Pa transmit pas bacterium . The bacterium pass direct contact two individual kiss touch hand . Another way pas Pa indirect contact touch object like eat utensil drinking glass use someone Pa . There many unanswered question Pa lung infection people CF . For example , know people CF develop Pa lung infection earlier others . Nor known difficult eradicate Pa child child 's condition deteriorate quicker become infect Pa . Biological parent child CF carrier one CF cause gene mutation . It also possible carrier additional , milder , CF-related gene mutation . It possible carrier status parent CF child place risk acquire carry Pa lung . Biological parent child CF ask participate . This study plan assess frequency Pa biological parent correlate clinical microbiological status CF child PA carrier rate parent . Parents ask complete questionnaire one routine , clinic visit , nasal throat culture collect child 's routine schedule visit 3-4 month later ( another routine visit ) . The investigator also ask permission review medical record child CF .</detailed_description>
