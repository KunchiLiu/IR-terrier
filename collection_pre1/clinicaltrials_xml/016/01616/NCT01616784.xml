	<brief_summary>For type-1 diabetes , aim insulin therapy keep blood glucose close normal avoid hypoglycaemia severely limited relative crudeness current insulin delivery comparison physiology β-cells secrete insulin . Insulin generally administer multiple injection MDI dose adjust accord eat exercise . Insulin also administer use pump ( CSII ) , device , roughly size mobile phone contain sufficient insulin supply need basal metabolism throughout day , boluses cover meal . The use CSII expensive compare injection , important potential benefit include improved glycaemic control , reduce risk hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) flexible lifestyle good quality life . There trial adult compare CSII treatment MDI structure train intensive insulin therapy give , precise benefit pump technology still unclear . There need establish , identify patient benefit Department Health calculate proportion adult would benefit CSII therapy ensure commission body provide necessary reimbursement . The aim trial therefore establish added benefit CSII therapy multiple injection glycaemic control hypoglycaemia individual Type 1 diabetes receive similar high quality structure training ( Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating : DAFNE ) insulin therapy . Additional assessment include effect quality life cost effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The REPOSE ( Relative Effectiveness Pumps Over MDI Structured Education ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial multi-centre randomise control trial whereby 40 49 type-1 diabetic , adult volunteer , age 18 , recruit per site 7 secondary care centre ( Sheffield , Kings College Hospital London , Harrogate District Hospital , Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge , Glasgow Royal Infirmary , Dumfries Galloway Royal Infirmary Edinburgh Royal Infirmary ) . The site require recruit participant least 3 CSII DAFNE ( Dose Adjustment Normal Eating ) course 3 MDI DAFNE course . This mean total trial , 140 participant randomise CSII 140 MDI . Participants recruit direct approach already wait list DAFNE course advertisement various clinic .</detailed_description>
