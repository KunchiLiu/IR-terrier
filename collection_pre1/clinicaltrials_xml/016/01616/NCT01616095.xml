	<brief_summary>This study design follow study perform 2005 . In Baseline study ( 2005 ) extensive clinical whole body metabolic phenotyping combine depth molecular cellular biology analysis aim investigate adipose tissue morphology well metabolic inflammatory phenotype adult GHD patient . Results publish ( Ukropec et al. , 2008 ) In study identical endpoint investigate methodology within population ; order seek relevant answer question 6-yrs rhGH therapy affect - whole body insulin sensitivity - energy expenditure - body fat distribution - hepatic skeletal muscle lipid content ; well influence adipose tissue - endocrine , - metabolic &amp; - inflammatory phenotype . The strength plan study lie extensive whole body adipose tissue phenotyping 6-year rhGH replacement therapy , allow determine long-term effect rhGH replacement therapy GHD adult . Envisaged weakness limit size population ; GHD adult ( n=20 ) ; control [ age BMI gender match ] ( n=20 ) . This , however , reflect [ limit ] complexity study protocol well stringency inclusion criterion . The clinical data obtain method - integrate physiology would provide excellent interpretation background molecular-genetic study tissue ( adipose tissue ) cellular ( adipocytes ) level . Integration two could bring new quality investigator understand metabolic derangement present GHD , allow extend investigator knowledge mechanisms long-term rhGH-therapy-induced improvement body composition , metabolic health cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>We follow inclusionexclusion criterion much like use pilot study perform 2005 . Briefly , duration GHD prior enter study last least 3 year prior rhGH treatment start . Age individual eligible enter 2050 year old . All patient healthy control volunteer provide witness write informed consent entry study . It note difference etiology GHD might influence several outcome plan measure . Presence absence possible bias therefore exclude specific outcome prior statistical data analysis . Individuals different degree pituitary deficiency therefore eligible enter study . Complex information adequacy hormone replacement therapy base serum level growth hormone , insulinlike growth factor 1 , free thyroid hormone , testosterone/estradiol , urinary free cortisol FT4 , morning cortisol . Examination laboratory test relevant study perform within 6 month enter study . The 24hour urinary free cortisol determine individual hospitalize period two month prior study entry . None patient receive lipid lowering treatment . Patients malignant disease , diabetes mellitus , exist vascular disease uncontrolled hypertension eligible enter study .</criteria>
