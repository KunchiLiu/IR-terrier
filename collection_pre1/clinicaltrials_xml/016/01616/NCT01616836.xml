	<brief_summary>The aim study determine best method pain control help rehabilitation total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Currently , best method pain control TKA appear continuous femoral nerve block ( FNB ) small tube place beside nerve provide sensation large part knee local anesthetic infuse surgery cause numbness surgical site . A single injection method also exist may provide similar benefit . Both method require train result side effect temporary weakness ( local anesthetic still work ) inhibit rehabilitation . A new method inject local anesthetic joint surgery ( Local Infiltration Analgesia ( LIA ) ) become common , cause weakness do quickly end surgery . It unknown pain control provide LIA good FNB . This study compare femoral nerve block , continuous femoral nerve block LIA technique determine provide well pain relief TKA .</brief_summary>
