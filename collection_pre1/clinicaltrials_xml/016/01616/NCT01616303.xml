	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 randomize study two treatment arm compare effectiveness oregovomab ( murine monoclonal antibody direct cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) ) combine first-line chemotherapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel ) first-line chemotherapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel ) alone female patient advanced ovarian cancer . This study confirm previous result show oregovomab able help body produce immune response CA125 ( target identify ovarian cancer cell ) patient stage III-IV ovarian cancer receive chemotherapy disease . The primary aim study see well patient advance ovarian cancer make immune response CA125 use specific test ( enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay ) patient 's blood . The study also look side effect oregovomab , immune response parameter , well patient respond treatment disease ( long take show disease progress long patient survive overall ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Controlled Study Effectiveness Oregovomab ( Antibody ) Plus Chemotherapy Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate new case ovarian cancer US 2012 approximately 22,280 estimated death approximately 15,500 The five year survival rate ovarian cancer approximately 40 % . More half diagnosed ovarian cancer advance disease . Although complete response common follow initial treatment platinum taxane regimen , within two year cytoreductive surgery Stage III/IV disease , one-half tumor recur . Once patient relapse curative therapy . Recurrent ovarian cancer invariably fatal . Thus , need new therapy reduce rate recurrence prolong relapse-free interval . Oregovomab investigational drug previously use clinical trial immunotherapeutic treatment ovarian cancer patient whose tumor cell express tumor associate antigen , CA125 . The active component oregovomab activate murine monoclonal antibody B43.13 , immunoglobulin G1k ( IgG1k ) subclass immunoglobulin bind high affinity ( 1.16E10/M ) CA125 . CA125 surface glycoprotein antigen express 80 % non-mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinoma occurs elevate level serum patient ovarian cancer . Little known biological function . CA125 associate large molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein complex 200-250 kilodaltons ( kDa ) genetic structure recently elucidate . There good evidence suggest CA125 relevant target antigen antigen-mediated immunotherapy ovarian cancer . Immunotherapy therapeutic approach treatment cancer recently establish use several approach . Sipuleucel T use autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC 's ) source antigen present cell load patient cell prostate cancer tumor antigen induce cellular immunity direct prostate cancer . With recent approval approach FDA advance prostate cancer base control survival data demonstrate induction cellular immunity bring benefit cancer patient . The recent success ipilimumab prolong survival melanoma patient use antibody delay regulation specific immune response support rationale induction specific T cell immunity cancer viable therapeutic approach . To date successful immunotherapeutic approach establish ovarian cancer , recurrent advance ovarian cancer remain incurable disease . Oregovomab , dose 2 mg , demonstrate induce cross presentation CA125 peptide fragment induce CA125 specific cellular immune response . Most clinical trial oregovomab conduct maintenance set chemotherapy administer magnitude response clinical set proven inadequate produce clinical benefit . Several report , however , suggest administration oregovomab association chemotherapy may result enhance cellular immunity relative monotherapy setting . In 2009 , randomize phase 2 study conduct simultaneous oregovomab standard chemotherapy administer first group patient oregovomab administer week chemotherapy second group . The study show arm subject simultaneous immuno-chemotherapy develop good immune response ( contrary previously think consider immunosuppressive effect chemotherapy ) . Further study , however , need completely assess magnitude immune response . The measure effectiveness immunotherapy treatment cancer fraught inability successfully measure direct effect tumor burden similar cytotoxic therapy . We therefore believe importance assess rate positivity obtain ELISPOT method also verify safety , tolerability , intradermal antibody response , assess eventual delay hypersensitivity ( DTH ) oregovomab , disease-free survival , overall survival ( date fix last visit complete entire population evaluation ) . In maintenance protocol oregovomab , 10 % patient undergoing oregovomab treatment develop positive response ELISPOT assay perform without vitro stimulation . In 2009 Phase 2 trial , 42 % patient simultaneous infusion arm 22 % patient one-week delay arm positive ELISPOT response . Considering effect optimal population equal great obtain previously , assume 50 % study population chemoimmunotherapy arm develop positive response ELISPOT assay protocol . We assume positive value CA125 patient enrol trial provide good level immunity specific glycoprotein arm undergoing chemo-immunotherapy . This study evaluate immune response obtain administration oregovomab 's correlated clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
