	<detailed_description>Hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke , diabetes complication include renal failure neuropathy major contributor healthcare costs1 . Metabolic Syndrome , widespread genetic trait refers group factor increase risk disease . Progression component metabolic syndrome significantly reduce dietary manipulation exercise . The age population , metabolic syndrome muscular weakness , go result enormous social financial burden medical care also family care patient . Existing knowledge would suggest dietary modification exercise training would substantially reduce cost complication medical condition . The Canadian Guidelines diagnosis management cardiometabolic risk identify patient metabolic syndrome increase risk cardiac vascular disease diabetes application result prevent disease dismal failure general particular , country . The current model advice preventive care family doctor ( FD ) primary care set . FDs tend advise patient diet exercise variety reason include lack education modality , lack support professional qualify assess advise diet exercise , belief drug well , lack time lack reimbursement addition patient barrier adoption . Although factor , smoking , hypercoagulability increase expression proinflammatory cytokine increase cardiometabolic risk , change closely related metabolic syndrome . `` Health behavior intervention '' identify critical preventing occurrence cardiovascular disease diabetes . These intervention associate appropriate pharmacotherapy require . The guideline recommend multidisciplinary team manage intervention . In addition also recommend ethnicity consider intervention . The various trait associate metabolic syndrome strongly influence genetic factor , i.e . heritability abdominal obesity insulin resistance estimate high 70 % . Accordingly , investigator propose implement 'program ' nutrition exercise intervention imbed primary care set tailor reduce risk metabolic syndrome overcome barrier . Numerous genetic polymorphism ( also refer marker ) link various trait associate metabolic syndrome . It hypothesize marker use mean well predict variable response observe individual follow lifestyle intervention . Several company begin commercialize direct-to-consumer genetic-testing provide nutritional counseling individual base analysis small subset polymorphisms11 ; however , absence scientific research either support refute value genetic marker predict individual 's response . Considering common genetic marker lifestyle intervention study enable u assess value predict response .</detailed_description>
