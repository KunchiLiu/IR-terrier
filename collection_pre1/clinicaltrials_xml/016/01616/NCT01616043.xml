	<brief_summary>The heal full thickness skin defect treat split thickness skin graft ( STSG ) frequently associate excessive scarring contraction . The psychological burden poor cosmesis scar region well functional problem due skin tightness decrease joint mobility cause significant morbidity patient . Application dermal substitute underneath split skin may improve quality scar . Glyaderm dermal substitute derive human skin due elastin substitute contribute long term improvement pliability function well esthetic outcome . The main objective evaluate difference scar quality , skin restoration full thickness defect treat Glyaderm® STSG versus STSG alone . Secondary objective : evaluate percentage Glyaderm® take application autograft , compare heal time percentage autograft survival bacterial load full thickness defect treat Glyaderm® STSG versus STSG alone , conduct concurrent cost-effectiveness health relate quality life study ( i.e . cost utility analysis ) . The study interventional , prospective , randomize control interactive web base , study multicentre setting . Patients full thickness burn wound full thickness skin defect evaluate enrolment . A total 120 patient include . All include patient undergo full thickness removal burn skin adequate debridement necrotic tissue . The wound patient cover glycerol preserve allograft wound bed preparation . At second operation , 5-7 day first operation , allografts remove . If wound bed suitable grafting , additional wound bed preparation allograft require wound bed satisfactory . If wound bed suitable grafting , patient randomize Glyaderm® group control group . The wound patient randomize Glyaderm® group cover Glyaderm® . After 6-8 day wound finally cover thin STSG . In control group , wound immediately cover thin STSG . Up one year complete wound closure , patient followed-up scar evaluation quality life .</brief_summary>
