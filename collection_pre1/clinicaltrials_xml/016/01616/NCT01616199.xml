	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 1 portion study determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose ( RD ) safety/tolerability PX-866 combination vemurafenib patient advance BRAF-mutant cancer . The purpose phase 2 portion study compare progression free survival ( PFS ) , antitumor activity ( response rate ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , safety tolerability PX-866 combination vemurafenib vs. vemurafenib alone patient advance BRAF-mutant melanoma dos recommend Phase 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study PX-866 Vemurafenib Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 / 2 open-label study PX-866 give combination vemurafenib patient BRAF-mutant cancer , include advanced melanoma . Phase 1 use 3+3 dose escalation design evaluate three dose level PX-866 combination two dose level vemurafenib order identify maximal tolerate dose/recommended dose ( MTD/RD ) PX-866 vemurafenib use Phase 2 . Vemurafenib administer orally twice per day day 1-28 cycle except cycle 1 , vemurafenib administer day 9-28 allow PK assessment ) . PX-866 administered per day day 1-28 cycle . Phase 2 evaluate antitumor activity safety PX-866 give patient randomize 2:1 receive combination vemurafenib dose recommended Phase 1 compare vemurafenib alone administer approve dose orally BID . All treatment administer 28-day cycle . Patients randomized receive single-agent vemurafenib may cross-over receive combination treatment time progression . Patients evaluated progression approximately every 8 week initial 24 week every 12 week thereafter . All patient stable disease ( SD ) well , receive repeat cycle disease progression ( PD ) , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
