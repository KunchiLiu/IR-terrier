	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled foot ankle surgery typically receive single shot sciatic nerve block serve primary anesthetic part multi-modal post-operative analgesic plan . Perineural dexamethasone investigate adjuvant brachial plexus nerve block effect sciatic nerve block outcome yet determine . More importantly , know whether beneficial effect perineural dexamethasone analgesia duration lead good quality surgical recovery . We hypothesize perineural dexamethasone lead good quality postsurgical recovery intravenous dexamethasone saline control .</detailed_description>
