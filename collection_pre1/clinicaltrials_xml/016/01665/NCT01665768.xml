	<brief_title>Maintenance Rituximab With mTor Inhibition After High-dose Consolidative Therapy Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus pill interfere lymphoma cell growth block cellular pathway important causing cancer cell grow , call mTor . Rituximab intravenous medication specifically attack protein commonly find lymphoma cell call CD20 . Rituximab already widely use treat multiple form lymphoma . Moreover , continue rituximab completion chemotherapy already commonly use help patient stay remission longer . Everolimus show many type relapse lymphoma decrease size lymph node . Everolimus approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advanced kidney cancer subependymal giant cell astocytoma . It approve use lymphoma . The use everolimus research study investigational . The word `` investigational '' mean everolimus approve marketing Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The FDA allow use everolimus study . The combination everolimus rituximab 1 year high dose therapy also new . We believe combination medication right chemotherapy effective attack remain cancer time re-grow . The usual treatment lymphoma high-dose chemotherapy observation . After body fully recovered effect chemotherapy , receive everolimus daily one year IV rituximab four time year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year age ECOG performance status ≤ 2 INR ≤ 2 Adequate renal hepatic function define serum creatinine &lt; 2.0mg/dL , total bilirubin &lt; 5mg/dL , AST ALT ˂ 2.5 ULN . Platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 10mg/dL ANC &gt; 3.0x109/L Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . A willingness use accept effective method birth control sexually active woman childbearing potential study 8 week end study drug treatment . Ability sign inform consent Patient previously receive mTor inhibitor Patients preterminal moribund Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start Everolimus ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary Chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale cortosteroids allow Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start Everolimus study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine ; Patients history another primary solild malignancy , exception : nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , uterus , breast patient disease free ≥3 year ; Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable able complete entire study ; Patients active bacterial fungal infection require oral intravenous antimicrobial eligible resolution infection Female patient pregnant breast feeding , reproductive potential whoe use effective birth control method . Adequate contraception must use throughout trial 8 week last dose study drug . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) WOCBP willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment Patients know intolerance rituximab Known history HIV Hepatitis C Active Hepatitis B define seropositivity hepatitis B surface antigen . Subjects positive hepatitis B core antibody titer normal liver transaminase allow provide prophylaxis administer per institutional guideline . Please see Addendum 8 action take patient positive baseline hepatitis B result .</criteria>
