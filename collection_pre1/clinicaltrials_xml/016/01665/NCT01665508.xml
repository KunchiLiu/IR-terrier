	<brief_summary>Women less significant blockage coronary artery , however great symptom bad outcome compare age-matched male counterpart . This paradox lead recognition importance microvasculature ( small vessel ) contributor symptom outcomes . Nebivolol unique antioxidant property dilate blood vessel therefore propose treatment nebivolol reduce angina ( chest symptom ) woman microvascular disease well improve exercise capacity , reduce resource utilization improve measure artery function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect Nebivolol Angina Women With Microvascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Though woman less obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) continue great burden symptom , myocardial ischemia , high rate adverse outcomes age-matched male counterpart . This ostensible paradox lead recognition distinct pathophysiology ischemic heart disease , part relate microvascular dysfunction , abnormal coronary reactivity . The term primary microvascular angina , ( MVA ) use describe syndrome among patient symptom suggestive cardiac ischemia , evidence electrocardiographic abnormality , abnormality stress image history ACS , evidence obstructive epicardial coronary disease . In population , microvascular angina cause significant morbidity may contribute increased mortality . The treatment microvascular disease remain empirical due lack data regard symptom alleviation , well ultimate mortality reduction . Women ischemic heart disease microvascular angina continue report frequent angina bad quality life . They frequently seek medical attention evaluation cardiovascular symptom include chest pain shortness breath . Consequently , woman incur great healthcare cost , office visit , hospitalization , myocardial infarction . In fact , one half woman without obstructive coronary disease continue ischemic symptom lead consumption CAD resource , often diagnostic uncertainty . In absence robust outcome data drive care woman microvascular ischemia , various approach take , addition fundamental management baseline risk factor . Some physician treat woman would treat patient know obstructive CAD , , set `` open '' coronary artery persistent chest pain , opt reassurance . Nevertheless , give woman microvascular ischemia continue high morbidity mortality , well increase resource consumption , widely recognize need effective therapeutic agent reduce symptom , improve quality life , decrease resource consumption , ultimately reduce mortality . Nebivolol , due unique antioxidant vasodilator property , via effect NO bioactivity , subsequent effect endothelium may potentially ideal therapeutic agent treatment microvascular angina among woman . For example , one previous study show nebivolol improve exercise parameter , well endothelial function , effectively beta blockade metoprolol , among patient persistent angina non-obstructive coronary disease . Cardiopulmonary exercise test ideal diagnostic test study provide unique information microvascular ischemia influence functional capacity measure sensitive gas exchange parameter . Because know distinct pathophysiology contributes microvascular angina among subset woman , parameter provide CPET may provide essential information regard mechanism symptom mitigation nebivolol confer therapeutic value . Furthermore , exercise tolerance often significantly impair , objective measure gas exchange reflect submaximum maximum fitness among woman useful baseline nebivolol . Peripheral arterial tone pulse wave analysis also perform . PAT signal technology provide widely validate measurement endothelium-mediated change vascular tone , use non-invasive bio-sensors fingertip elicit create down-stream hyperemic response . This parameter correlate well endothelial dysfunction coronary artery . We perform endothelial function test baseline 3 month . Metabolomics emerge field offer possibility use body 's metabolite phenotype disease well track response isolate perturbation , administration drug . In study utilize metabolomics define signature microvascular ischemia well nebivolol-mediated change metabolic profile . Baseline metabolic profiling , well metabolic profile 3 month nebivolol treatment perform study . This type assessment ideal complement clinical parameter delineate combine target mass spectrometry measure small molecule relate nitric oxide metabolism ( ie : arginine , arginosuccinate , citrulline , ornithine , cGMP , ADMA ) well unbiased screen metabolite know associate either nebivolol exposure microvascular angina .</detailed_description>
