	<brief_summary>Our research examine chest pain care strategy , call HEART pathway , design correctly identify Emergency Department patient high-risk cardiovascular event , likely benefit testing , patient very-low-risk cardiovascular event , may safely discharge home . By use individual 's risk assessment determine testing , hope improve quality efficiency care deliver Emergency Department patient chest pain . Our study determine HEART pathway , combine clinical decision rule , HEART score , two serial troponin measurement , reduce stress test cardiovascular imaging , decrease hospital length stay , reduce cost compare usual care , maintain safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Evaluation HEART Pathway Emergency Department Patients With Acute Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 8-10 million patient complain chest pain present Emergency Department ( ED ) annually United States . The total cost chest pain evaluation estimate $ 5-10 billion annually , yet 10 % patient ultimately diagnose acute coronary syndrome . American College Cardiology/ American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) guideline recommend patient low-risk acute coronary syndrome receive serial cardiac marker follow objective cardiac testing ( stress test cardiac imaging ) . However , many question value objective cardiac test low-risk patients.Cardiac test patient low-risk acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) sustainable healthcare quality economic perspective . In addition increase cost , objective cardiac testing associate substantial number false positive non-diagnostic test , lead additional unnecessary often invasive procedure . Implementation accurate risk stratification care pathway design eliminate unnecessary cardiac test could improve efficiency quality care decrease false positive/non-diagnostic testing , radiation , cost . The HEART pathway , combine clinical decision rule , HEART score , two serial troponin measurement , recently develop care pathway design identify chest pain patient early discharge without objective testing . Primary Hypothesis : The HEART Pathway , compare usual care , reduce 30 day objective cardiac testing , hospital length stay , cost , maintain patient safety . Methods : Participants ( n=282 ) risk ACS recruit clinical trial Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center ( WFBMC ) ED . Patients equally randomized HEART Pathway Usual Care . HEART Pathway participant 's treat physician follow HEART Pathway guideline identify patient admit hospital observation unit cardiac test discharge home without test . Usual Care participant 's treating physician decide whether patient discharge home admit hospital observation unit base ACC/AHA guideline without use HEART pathway .</detailed_description>
