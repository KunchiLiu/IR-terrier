	<brief_summary>Implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICDs ) device put patient high risk sudden cardiac death . They use treat life threaten heart rhythm disorder . They conventionally consist generator sit skin chest lead pas vein collar bone region heart . Problems device necessitate extraction , common reason infection . If extraction require infection re-implantation usually defer approximately one week whilst antibiotic give risk infection new device minimise . This considerable implication healthcare resource . A new ICD develop entirely subcutaneous intravenous element . It already clinical use position remote conventional ICD site . With intravenous element little risk infection blood affect new device . It therefore likely possible re-implant device immediately extract conventional system . The aim research assess outcome patient re-implanted device immediately conventional ICD system extraction . This data compare compare conventional system re-implanted necessary delay .</brief_summary>
