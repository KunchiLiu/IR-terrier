	<brief_summary>Certain cancer require amino acid arginine . Arginine deiminase ( ADI ) enzyme microbes degrades arginine . ADI formulate polyethylene glycol , use treat patient cancer require arginine . In study , ADI combine well know chemotherapy cisplatin , safety potential efficacy combination explore patient cancer require arginine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor ( dose escalation component ) metastatic melanoma ( uveal cutaneous ) ( dose escalation MTD expansion component ) platinumresistant ( tumor progression within year completion platinumbased therapy ) ovarian carcinoma ( high grade serous , endometrial poorly differentiate endometrioid ) HCC fail treatment sorafenib tolerate sorafenib refuse sorafenib , HCC coexistent BCT treat chemotherapy , BCT treat chemotherapy . For HCC HCC coexistent BCT , cirrhotic status ChildPugh grade AB7 must present . ChildPugh status determine base clinical finding laboratory data screen period ( Appendix C ) . Subjects anticoagulant receive 1 point INR status , presume &lt; 1.7 baseline PT/INR . 2 . Ovarian cancer , HCC , HCC coexistent BCT , BCT tissue either archive specimen new biopsy sufficient amount quality available IHC determination ASS status perform retrospectively ovarian cancer , HCC , HCC coexistent BCT , BCT cohorts . Subjects tissue available would require biopsy . 3 . Unresectable disease patient refuse surgery . 4 . Progressive disease treat chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery immunotherapy . If prior radiation give , measurable disease outside radiation port . Unequivocal progression HCC/BTC lesions previously treat catheterbased therapy include transarterial chemoembolization radioembolization allow . 5 . Measurable disease assess RECIST 1.1 criterion ( Appendix A ) . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 8 . No prior systemic therapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent , chemoembolization , radioembolization radiation therapy within last 4 week . 9 . Fully recover prior surgery major surgery within 4 week initiate treatment , except gamma knife take place within 2 week . Surgery placement vascular access device acceptable . 1 . Serious infection require treatment systemically administer antibiotic time study entrance , infection require systemic antibiotic therapy within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . For HCC , HCC/BTC BTC subgroup hepatitis C infection hepatitis B infection control antiviral therapy allowable . 2 . Pregnancy lactation . 3 . Expected noncompliance . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness , social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Subjects anticancer treatment prior enter study recover baseline ( except alopecia ) ≤ Grade 1 AEs , deem irreversible effect prior cancer therapy . AEs &gt; Grade 1 consider safety risk Sponsor investigator may allow upon agreement . 6 . Subjects history another primary cancer , include coexistent second malignancy , exception : ) curatively resect nonmelanoma skin cancer ; b ) curatively treated cervical carcinoma situ ; c ) primary solid tumor know active disease present opinion investigator affect patient outcome set current cancer diagnosis . 7 . Subjects treat ADIPEG 20 previously . 8 . History seizure disorder relate underlying cancer . 9 . Known HIV positivity ( test require ) .</criteria>
