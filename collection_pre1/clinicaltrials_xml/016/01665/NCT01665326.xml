	<detailed_description>Infantile-onset Pompe disease inherit disorder cause lack defect enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . GAA enzyme deficiency cause glycogen build damage cell throughout body , especially heart muscle , normally diagnose within first month life . Current treatment Pompe disease involve enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) use drug alglucosidase alfa ( Myozyme ) , provide form GAA enzyme replace enzyme miss work properly patient 's blood . In study , investigator learn patient 's ability tolerate ERT . Cross-Reactive Immunological Material ( CRIM ) measurement natural GAA production important factor affect patient respond ERT Myozyme . Children produce natural GAA classify CRIM positive ( + ) , child produce natural GAA classify CRIM negative ( - ) . Children CRIM+ generally tolerate ERT well . But , child CRIM- , child classify CRIM+ , poor response ERT due complication immune response drug . Treatments currently develop stop immune response prevent complication ERT . This longitudinal natural history study Infantile Pompe disease .
