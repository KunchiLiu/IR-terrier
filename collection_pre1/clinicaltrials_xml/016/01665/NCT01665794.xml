	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study safety best dose carfilzomib see well work give together pomalidomide dexamethasone treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Pomalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving carfilzomib together pomalidomide dexamethasone may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Pomalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) carfilzomib administer combination fix dose pomalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . II . To determine efficacy combination regimen MTD measure partial response ( PR ) response rate define per International Myeloma Working Group ( IMW ) criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine best stringent complete response ( sCR ) /CR/nodular complete response ( nCR ) &gt; = good partial response ( VGPR ) rate . II . To estimate time study ( TOS ) , duration response ( DOR ) , time progression ( TTP ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) distribution . III . To define toxicity MTD . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform analysis subset patient refractory either pomalidomide carfilzomib lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone ( RVD ) combination . II . To evaluate status minimal residual disease ( MRD ) patient achieve sCR , CR nCR . III . To evaluate prognostic marker marker response pomalidomide , dexamethasone , carfilzomib ( PdC ) patient refractory lenalidomide analyze pre-treatment clinical covariates pre-treatment plasma cell profile proteomics gene expression profile ( GEP ) . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study carfilzomib follow phase II . Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 , pomalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease may continue receive treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
