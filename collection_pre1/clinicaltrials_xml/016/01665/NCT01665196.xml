	<brief_summary>This open-label study investigate diagnostic performance 18F-FDG PET/CT ( positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) evaluation patient IgG4-related disease . A single dose 18F-FDG intravenously injected patient IgG4-related disease treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FDG PET/CT IgG4-Related Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunoglobulin G4-related disease ( IgG4-RD ) recently define emerge clinical entity characterize tissue infiltration IgG4-positive plasma cell , tissue fibrosclerosis elevate serum IgG4 concentration . The important feature IgG4-RD chronic inflammation multiple organ involvement . However , organ involvement difficult find ultrasound , CT MRI . 18F-FDG PET/CT sensitive image tool inflammation . In study , PET/CT perform patient IgG4-RD glucocorticoid treatment single dose 18F-FDG . Visual semiquantitative method employ assess PET/CT image . The PET/CT image data use establish diagnostic model well assessment criterion response evaluation IgG4-RD treatment .</detailed_description>
