	<brief_summary>Prior work show exogenous L-carnitine administration enhances glucose lactate oxidation , attenuate fatty acid toxicity , improve endothelial-smooth muscle couple cardiac mechanical efficiency . The overall goal proposal investigate L-carnitine novel adjunctive treatment septic shock . In study investigator test primary hypothesis : Early adjunctive L-carnitine administration vasopressor dependent septic shock significantly reduce cumulative organ failure 48 hour associated decrease 28-day mortality suggest need phase III study . To accomplish investigator conduct phase II , double blind , placebo control , adaptive randomize trial 250 eligible patient vasopressor-dependent septic shock . Study subject assign one four arm : low ( 6g ) , medium ( 12g ) high ( 18g ) dose intravenous L-carnitine placebo 12 hour part early resuscitative care .</brief_summary>
