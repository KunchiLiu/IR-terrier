	<brief_summary>The number overweight obese child increase Ireland great rate worldwide trend . The poor eating pattern drive adolescent obesity lead increase number unhealthy inflammatory hormone fat circulate blood increase adolescent 's risk develop diabetes heart disease later life . Dietary pattern change whereby key nutrient find fruit , vegetable fish , know beneficial effect reduce risk obesity diabetes later life , may need replace . This project determine whether key anti-inflammatory nutrient supplement take 8 week improve metabolic profile adolescent age 13-18 year old . Detailed cellular analysis determine cellular molecular mechanism provide thorough explanation health effect intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Dietary Intervention Overweight Obese Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emerge model obesity diabetes characterise sub-acute chronic inflammation insulin resistance . Mechanistic data indicates inflame adipose tissue increase infiltration immune cell generate pro-inflammatory cytokine . With childhood obesity Ireland increase rapid pace , important establish role non-pharmacological dietary approach decrease sub-acute chronic inflammation see overweight obese child . Several food contain nutrient know anti-inflammatory property . Such food include fish , fruits vegetable know deplete adolescent diet . The aim project investigate whether nutritional supplement contain anti-inflammatory nutrient , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( find fish oil ) , vitamin C , vitamin E , polyphenols find green tea tomato ; improve metabolic phenotype 13-18 year old teenager 8-week period . Further , provide insight role genetics development metabolic dysregulation response dietary treatment .</detailed_description>
