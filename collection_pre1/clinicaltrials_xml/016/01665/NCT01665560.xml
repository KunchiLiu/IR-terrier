	<brief_summary>The overarch goal project understand nicotine addiction interacts feed behavior brain representation food reward . The current proposal part large effort begin program research elucidate similarity differences perception , behavioral neural response , food cigarette aroma function 1 ) smoking status ( smoker , ex-smokers gain weight , ex-smokers gain weight , non-smokers ) , 2 ) internal state ( hungry , full ) , 3 ) cigarette deprivation ( acute , chronic ) . A general hypothesis overlap neural mechanism govern food reward cigarette reward smoker overlap include incentive salience encoding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Weight gain frequently follow smoke cessation . Fear weight gain cite key reason quit actual weight gain primary reason relapse , especially among woman . Although cause weight gain follow smoke cessation complex , increase caloric intake recognize one primary source . One explanation increase caloric intake , common neural mechanism food cigarette reward hence food reward substitute cigarette reward vice versa . An alternative explanation weight gain follow smoke cessation overall decrease brain reward function nicotine withdrawal , lead decrease reward value food consequent increase intake maintain total amount reward obtain food . The success propose study rely upon ability deliver odorants fMRI scanner measure neural activation region amygdala , susceptible inhomogeneity artifact .</detailed_description>
