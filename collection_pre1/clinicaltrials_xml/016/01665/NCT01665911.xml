	<brief_summary>The study randomize , investigator-blind , observer-blind , laboratory analyst-blind utilize 5-way cross-over study design primary objective determine high dose fluoride milk provide great caries preventive effect . Secondary objective determine high concentration fluoride milk provide great caries preventive effect caries preventive effect fluoridate milk follow dose-response pattern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Situ Study Impact Fluoride Dose Concentration Milk Its Anti-caries Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evidence milk fluoridation public health measure caries prevention demonstrate many clinical study . While data encourage , main focus optimization milk fluoride program . This protocol concentrate parameter fluoride dose concentration utilize situ model , intra-oral caries test model ( ICT ) . The ICT establish model feature use gauze-covered specimen facilitate plaque growth simulate caries-prone/plaque stagnation area . After subject consent enrolled study per inclusion/exclusion criterion , two three day follow dental cleaning , two partially demineralize specimen place buccal flange area subject 's mandibular partial denture . During five , three-week test period , subject drink assign milk test product per day either five ( 100 ml milk ) ten ( 200 ml milk ) time minute , wear mandibular partial denture 24 hour day test period . Fluoride free toothpaste use two three day continuously treatment period . After three-week test period , two partially demineralize specimen remove subject 's partial denture analyze use surface microhardness test . Mineral content change ( percentage surface microhardness recovery ) artificially induced incipient enamel lesion primary outcome variable . Each subject ( n = 28 ) serve control .</detailed_description>
