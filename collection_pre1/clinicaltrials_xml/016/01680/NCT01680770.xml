	<brief_title>Use Ultrasonography Determine Fluid-responsiveness Shock Population Intensive Care Unit Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shock common occurrence intensive care unit ( ICU ) , management condition frequently require administration intravenous fluid ( IVF ) . Multiple study show 50 % patient respond fluid . The ability predict patient respond important tool clinician treat shock avoid unnecessary fluid administration unlikely respond . This essential avoid adverse effect fluid load occur . A number study attempt determine predictor volume-responsiveness various method , include use ultrasonography perform intensivists , anesthesiologist emergency medicine physician . The currently publish study establish predictor fluid-responsiveness population . However , large variability study design , make difficult compare different modality . The objective study determine correlation transthoracic ultrasonographic index fluid responsiveness change direct measure cardiac output compare establish predictor fluid responsiveness central venous pressure variation , systolic arterial pressure variation pulse pressure variation . Furthermore , wish include broad range patient different type shock order determine generalize applicability index . Additionally , report success intensivist-obtained echocardiographic image varies widely literature , study report view accessible . We plan study prospectively view obtainable correlate patient characteristic . This would potentially establish echocardiography intensivist widely applicable , non-invasive , easily accessible method determine fluid-responsiveness patient shock . Achievement goal would allow clinician quickly identify patient would respond fluids time minimize administration fluid unlikely benefit .</detailed_description>
