	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate possible benefit give anti-HIV drug maraviroc people take darunavir/ritonavir alone HIV treatment . Many people successfully take darunavir/ritonavir treatment HIV . However , concern treatment may reach area body , brain spinal cord ( central nervous system CNS ) , effectively bloodstream . There already large clinical study look difference 'conventional ' HIV treatment 3 drug single drug treatment protease inhibitor , also call PI monotherapy , darunavir/ritonavir . This include difference effect CNS . However , study finish 2013 . The investigator know maraviroc reach CNS effectively . The investigator study investigate effect add maraviroc darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy look level inflammation within fluid surround CNS , call cerebrospinal fluid CSF . Maraviroc license drug treatment HIV treatment.. It show good result 2 clinical study take people whose HIV virus develop resistance previous HIV treatment . This study also investigate safety well monitor effectiveness patient take maraviroc take top normal treatment darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy . Maraviroc show present fluid surround brain people take Maraviroc . It know whether presence Maraviroc impact brain function . Therefore study also investigate brain ( neurocognitive ) function computer test write test .</brief_summary>
