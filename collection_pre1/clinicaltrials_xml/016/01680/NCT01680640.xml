	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) liver condition fat build liver cause alcohol . The liver organ design build fat . NAFLD common people much body fat abdomen diabetes ( high blood sugar ) , always exist condition . NAFLD also occur thin people . NAFLD harmful liver may cause liver fail time . NAFLD may also cause adult ( type 2 ) diabetes also heart disease . In people already diabetes , NAFLD cause glucose ( sugar ) level high . Our intestine ( gut ) contain healthy bacteria harmful bacteria ( bug ) . This balance healthy harmful bug essential normal working intestine digest food . Providing bacteria leak blood cause harm . If balance healthy harmful bug upset , harmful cause problem leak blood . Because liver connect intestine blood vessel harmful bacteria get liver cause problem . These bacteria cause liver body build much fat might cause NAFLD obesity . In study , test effect supplement ( synbiotic ) take day , contain mixture 'good ' healthy bacteria ( probiotic ) sugar ( prebiotic ) break absorb blood . We test whether synbiotic supplement beneficial effect NAFLD liver condition factor link much body fat , diabetes heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Synbiotic Treatment NAFLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recruit people NAFLD diagnose part NHS care condition . At present treatment condition . Purpose design : We ask research question : `` Does modulation gut microflora synbiotic improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease relate risk factor heart disease type 2 diabetes ? '' Presently treatment liver condition . Research evidence suggest synbiotic supplement might beneficial condition . To address research question want undertake randomise double blind placebo control trial recruiting people diagnose NAFLD .</detailed_description>
