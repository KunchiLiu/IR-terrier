	<brief_title>Safety Effect The HDAC Inhibitor Panobinostat HIV-1 Expression Patients Suppressive HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite effective highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) , HIV-infection persist rebound upon treatment interruption , presumably due latently infect rest CD4+ T-cells . To achieve eradication HIV-infection reservoir latently HIV-infected cell must deplete . Several therapeutic strategy consider HIV-cure related research . One approach exploit ability histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor reactivate HIV-1 expression latently infect cell presence HAART . This investigator initiate single-group , non-randomized interventional phase I/II trial design evaluate safety ability oral panobinostat activate HIV-transcription latently infect CD4+ T-cells HIV-infected patient suppressive HAART . The study enrol 16 patient . Each subject use his/her control before-after design : endpoint measure study intervention compare baseline subject . The main study comprise three phase : 1 . A pre-treatment screening/observation phase 4 week ( week 0-4 ) 2 . A treatment phase 8 week ( week 4-12 ) , 20 mg panobinostat administer orally day 1 , 3 , 5 ( TIW ) every week ( QOW ) maintain background HAART ( co-therapy ) 3 . A post-treatment follow-up phase 24 week ( week 12-36 ) evaluate effect study treatment Study participant review 13 time course study treatment follow-up . Blood drawn HIV viral load assessment , CD4 cell count , biochemistry , hematology additional immunological virological analysis . An electrocardiogram heart ( ECG ) take screening , day 10 24 post treatment initiation . The safety tolerability panobinostat evaluate base physical exam , laboratory test question problem patient may experience study . A pre-specified schedule base guide dose modification case unacceptable adverse effect .</detailed_description>
