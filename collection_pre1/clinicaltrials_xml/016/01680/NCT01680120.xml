	<detailed_description>Fractured neck femur ( FNF ) common cause admission hospital elderly patient require operative fixation . Spinal anaesthesia ( SA ) one option , since 1899 Bier describe first administration technique go many change . Spinal anaesthesia definitive advantage profound nerve block produce large part body relatively simple injection small amount local anaesthetic . Although case single shot SA contraindicate severe haemodynamic side effect . In elderly patient undergo hip fracture repair , continuous spinal anaesthesia ( CSA ) provide few episode hypotension severe hypotension compare single intrathecal injection 7.5 mg bupivacaine . We evidence minimum effective local anaesthetic dose ( MLAD ) hip replacement surgery MLAD achieve surgical anaesthesia operative fixation FNF still unknown . It would however beneficial patient haemodinamicaly unstable . A step-up/step-down methodology use successfully regional anaesthesia also area anaesthesia . In pregnant lady spinal anaesthesia perform side , significant correlation exist vertebral length measure cervical 7 iliac creast MLAD . We propose study MLAD continuous spinal anaesthesia ( CSA ) operative fixation FNF . Objectives : We would like determine MLAD hyperbaric 0.5 % bupivacaine require CSA operative fixation FNF . After ethical approval obtain appropriate consent start recruitment study . Patients receive premedication prior arrival operating room . All patient receive oxygen ( 35 % oxgen Venturi facemask ) procedure , include first postoperative hour . Standard monitor include continuous electrocardiogram , noninvasive automate arterial blood pressure pulse oximetry apply . Patients receive ultrasound guided femoral nerve block , 15 ml 2 % lignocaine turn lateral position lumbar puncture . After antiseptic preparation area , lumbar puncture perform experienced senior anesthesiologist . Subarachnoid puncture perform 18-gauge Tuohy needle L4-5 L3-4 interspace use midline approach . Three cm 22-gauge catheter introduce cephalad needle . The initial dose arbitrarily choose 1 ml 0.5 % isobaric bupivacaine basis clinical experience , local anaesthetic inject catheter 5-10 s. After completion injection patient remain lateral position 5 min return supine position . Successive injection 0.2 ml 0.5 % isobaric bupivacaine perform every 15 min satisfactory sensory level obtain ( T12 ) . Using step-up/step-down model , dose use follow patient determine outcome precede intrathecal block . In case failure initial dose need administer extra dose local anaesthetic 15 minute , initial dose increase 0.1 ml . Conversely , spinal success result reduction dose 0.1 ml . Noninvasive automate blood pressure heart rate measurement record spinal anesthesia ( baseline ) every three minute end local anesthetic injection till end surgery . Hypotension define decrease 20 % baseline systolic arterial blood pressure ( SAP ) . Severe hypotension define decrease SAP 30 % baseline value . Hypotension treat IV bolus ephedrine 6 mg heart rate 60/minutes phenylephrine 100 microgramm heart rate 60/minutes . In case failure insufficient block , general anesthesia perform . A blinded observer assess dermatome level sensory blockade ice-cold test ( ethyl-chloride spray ) bilaterally injection local anesthetic . Block assessment perform 15min interval 45 min completion initial intrathecal injection . The modified Bromage scale ( 0 - non-motor block ; 1 `` hip flexion extend leg block , 2-knee flexion block , 3-complete motor block ) use degree motor block bilaterally . Sensory function score present absent . Surgical anesthesia define absent appreciation cold sensation . The time interval surgical anesthesia achieve note . Total spinal anaesthesia failure define absence surgical anesthesia 45 min . The number hypotensive episode , total vasopressor administer , iv . fluid infuse record . Catheters CSA group remove surgery . All patient receive 1 g intravenous paracetamol 75 mg diclofenac sodium surgery . Postoperative analgesia consist 1 g oral paracetamol every 6 hour 75 mg diclofenac sodium twice daily 72 h surgery . Oxycodone 5 mg prescribe rescue analgesia spinal anaesthesia regression . Study-stopping Rules Based previous non-probability sequential dosing , up-and-down dose find study similar binary outcome . We estimate minimum five independent negative positive up-and-down deflection require calculate MLAD .</detailed_description>
