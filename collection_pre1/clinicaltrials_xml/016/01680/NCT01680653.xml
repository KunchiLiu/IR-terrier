	<brief_summary>The incidence low blood sugar hypoglycemic seizure diabetes camp reduce thanks overnight blood glucose level test . The timing overnight blood test often arbitrary unclear high frequency nocturnal hypoglycemic event camp occur . It also unclear appropriate treatment nocturnal hypoglycemia : simple carbohydrate , mini-glucagon . In study , use Continuous Glucose Monitors send subject data securely remote computer locate medical cottage camp throughout night . Study staff monitor computer intervene low blood sugar occurs real time . On half night , camper receive mini-glucagon low blood sugar , rest , receive standard carbohydrate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study include approximately 20 subject T1D per camp session . 10 link remote monitoring DIAs , 10 wear Dexcom CGM threshold alarm set wear DiAs ( 70 mg/dl ) , without remote monitoring . Study participant age 7-21 type 1 diabetes . This would allow counselor training young counselor history recent nocturnal hypoglycemia include . It late adolescent young adult often severe hypoglycemic event camp session . We preferentially recruit camper study : 1 ) history nocturnal hypoglycemia require treatment within last 2 month , 2 ) hypoglycemia unawareness confirm Clark screen test , 3 ) A1c &lt; 8 % require &gt; 0.7 units/kg/day insulin diabetes duration &gt; 1year . At begin camp , Dexcom G4 sensor insert participate subject initial calibration , calibrate blood glucose level morning bed day well Dexcom sensor request calibration . All insulin dos treatment decision camp base capillary blood glucose level base sensor reading . Each night , 10 20 camper randomly assign remote monitoring . The randomization schedule computer generate prior camp . A hypoglycemia threshold set 70 mg/dl . The Dexcom communicating DiAs sound local alarm , alarm generate remote monitoring . Medical personnel call remote monitoring station come camper 's cabin confirmatory capillary blood glucose ( CBG ) glucose obtain . If camper &lt; 70 hypoglycemia , treatment give ( use predictive alarm use rate change determine treatment ) . Treatment randomized mini-glucagon standard oral treatment camper &lt; 70 mg/dl 1:1 ratio . All subject le 70 mg/dl retested 15 minute CBG confirm recovery hypoglycemia . If sensor fail dislodge camp , replace . If sensor need replace 2 time , subject may drop different subject enrol . There design medical staff person monitor subject remotely night . A second staff person available go subject cabin provide treatment hypoglycemia . If second event occur time , third staff person `` call '' attend second camper .</detailed_description>
