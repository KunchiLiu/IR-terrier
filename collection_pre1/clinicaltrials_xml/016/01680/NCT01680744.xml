	<brief_title>The Effect Therapeutic Hypothermia Deceased Donor Renal Graft Outcomes - Randomized Controlled Trial From Region 5 Donor Management Goals Workgroup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number kidney available transplantation U.S. ( ~15,000/yr ) meet demand ( ~80,000/yr ) . This discrepancy likely worsen give increase U.S. prevalence chronic kidney disease compound sizable organ attrition organ enter donation process ( 25-30 % attrition Region 5 ) . Furthermore , worsen renal function donation neurologic determination death ( DNDD ) organ donor ( increasingly important source allograft ) one strong predictor delay graft function ( DGF ) slow graft function ( SGF ) recipient . Both DGF SGF associate decreased long-term organ survival major concern transplant community . To alleviate aforementioned supply-demand imbalance , two major unmet need must urgently address . First , active medical intervention test prospectively protect organ donation process hold sizable potential , remain exceedingly rare . Second , compliance pre-defined donor management protocol restore stabilize decease organ donor physiologic function remain low across different donation service area , despite evidence protocol may improve organ yield . The goal proposal , therefore , demonstrate ( 1 ) therapeutic hypothermia active medical intervention DNDD donor ( 2 ) compliance donor management protocol substantially improve allograft function survival . The investigator accomplish goal extend exist research infrastructure ( HRSA , R380T10586 ) across several donor service area . As , investigator bring together research network use power network properly test simple medical intervention , therapeutic hypothermia renal protection , prospective randomize single blind trial . Therapeutic hypothermia establish cytoprotective intervention demonstrate highly protective organ select critically ill patient . By combine two large donation service area nation ( CTDN , Northern California OneLegacy , Southern California ) , investigator access approximately 10 % organ donor nation . This proposal aim randomize 500 DNDD organ donor , big cohort enrol prospective randomize trial . The investigator leverage network track trial specific donor management protocol variable goal drive tight compliance already establish donor management protocol across donor service area Region 5 . This allow investigator compile large historical control cohort facilitate answer additional research question great detail . All organ procurement area Region 5 confirm willingness participate effort contribute relevant organ donor data via share web-portal . Through active participation , secondary gain improve report donor data compliance already accept donor management goal . Test feasibility improvement various kidney function metric commonly use evaluate organ health donation process . Ultimately , investigator believe multi-pronged approach may lead 800 1000 additional kidney successfully transplant nationwide year .</detailed_description>
