	<detailed_description>Introduction : New-onset diabetes transplantation ( NODAT ) strongly associate postoperative hyperglycemia , reduce patient well graft survival . In recent proof-of-concept clinical trial ( TIP ) , show immediate post-transplant basal insulin therapy decrease hyperglycemia reduces prevalence NODAT improve pancreatic β-cell function . In consequence , collaborative multicenter study NODAT prevention use basal insulin approve National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , start recruit 380 patient 6 international transplant center , include Medical University Vienna University Michigan 2012 . In addition NIH-sponsored trial , Vienna SAPT-NODAT study test hypotheses intensive subcutaneous insulin treatment short act insulin , apply continuously insulin pump combination glucose sensor ( SAPT ) , ( ) improve glycemic control , ( ii ) reduce prevalence NODAT prediabetes , ( iii ) offer β-cell protection , comparison standard care control group , basal insulin treatment group . Methods : Combining NIH-sponsored basal insulin study SAPT-NODAT study yield three study arm , 28 patient arm , namely : [ 1 ] control arm , treat standard-of-care ; [ 2 ] basal insulin arm , treat predominantly intermediate act NPH insulin ( human insulin isophane , Humulin N , Eli Lilly ) ; [ 3 ] SAPT arm , treat short act insulin ( Insulin lispro , Humalog , Eli Lilly ) , apply continuously SAPT technology . Adult patient absence diabetes randomize prior renal transplantation stratify deceased donor living donor , capable understanding study willing give inform write consent three study arm . Patients receive standard triple immunosuppressive medication ( twice-daily tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil mycophenolic sodium steroid ) predefined tacrolimus target steroid dos . The algorithm insulin administration design account prominent evening peak hyperglycemia observe previous TIP-study . The primary endpoint HbA1c ( rel. % ) , 3 month , superiority assume statistically significant difference SAPT-treatment group versus standard-of-care control group determine , two-sided Student 's t-test . Secondary endpoint compare three group include hypoglycemic event , glycemic variability , 2h glucose ≥200 mg/dL ( oral glucose tolerance test [ OGTT ] determine prevalence diabetes , prediabetes normal glucose tolerance ) , beta cell function insulin sensitivity derive OGTT , serum creatinine , quality life measure , patient graft survival . All secondary endpoint comparison rely OGTTs make 6 , 12 24 month kidney transplantation , respectively . The result 6-months OGTT blind patient investigator prevent subsequent treatment bias . Discussion : Basal insulin treatment previous proof-of-concept study could prevent high number transplant patient exhibit overt prediabetes ( impaired glucose tolerance ) 3 , 6 12 month , probably basis hyperglycemia improve , far aggressively treated patient receive basal insulin . Prediabetes however independent predictor all-cause mortality patient renal transplantation , therefore harbinger overt diabetes mellitus rather high-risk condition per se . The use HbA1c primary endpoint three month debatable , necessary determine whether SAPT technology may lead clinically meaningful improvement overall glucose control . Specifically , previous study ( TIP ) , observe intra-individual rise HbA1c ( 0.5±0.7 rel. % ) baseline 3 month , despite basal insulin treatment . If intra-individual rise SAPT arm remain value , SAPT technology could consider clinically meaningful improvement . The SAPT-NODAT study , besides hold promise improve glycemic control , thereby reduce diabetes , prediabetes possibly cardiovascular event transplantation , may ensure present team investigator continue take lead post-transplant insulin administration , emerge central focus NODAT-prevention may soon reach broad clinical application .

	<criteria>Adult patient end stage renal disease undergo kidney transplantation decease live donor kidney . Absence diabetes prior kidney transplantation , define accord American Diabetes Association guideline ( oral hypoglycemic agent insulin fast glucose &lt; 126 mg/dL ) . Receiving standard triple immunosuppressive medication include tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil mycophenolic sodium steroid . Capable understanding study willing give inform write consent study participation . Patients diagnosis diabetes mellitus prior kidney transplantation , receive antidiabetic medication , pretransplant fast glucose level equal great 126 mg/dL two occasion least three day apart . Patients receive organ transplant kidney . Patients receive unlicensed drug therapy within one month prior study entry . Patients history hypersensitivity injectable insulin . Patients document HIV infection .</criteria>
