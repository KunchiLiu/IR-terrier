	<criteria>Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) recipients newly require systemic glucocorticoid therapy ( ≥ 1mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) chronic GVHD Participants enrol begin study therapy ofatumumab within 14 day initiation 1 mg/kg/day prednisone therapy chronic GVHD . Relapse primary hematologic malignancy serve indication HCT . Previous systemic glucocorticoid therapy ( ≥ 1mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) chronic GVHD Prior systemic glucocorticoid therapy acute GVHD permit Prior ongoing systemic immune suppressive agent ( include , limited common example calcineurin inhibitor , sirolimus , mycophenolate mofetil ) provide either prevention treatment acute GVHD permit part routine standard care Current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception liver disease secondary chronic GVHD , patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Patients abnormal liver function test due chronic GVHD specifically exclude study . This common manifestation chronic GVHD , thus major target study therapy .
