	<brief_summary>Surgical correction congenital heart defect child require utilization cardiopulmonary bypass , technique temporarily substitute heart lung function surgery . During process patient´s circulation control bypass machine provide several function : 1 . Controls patient 's blood flow pump blood patient 's body . 2 . Controls correct oxygen level patient 's blood . 3 . Regulates temperature fluid level blood . This process trigger negative response heart throughout whole body , potentially result injury heart organs brain , kidneys lung . Remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) describe procedure could potentially reduce injury heart muscle cardiac surgery . The procedure consist inflation blood pressure cuff child 's leg three 5 minute cycle . This process act briefly reduce blood flow leg muscle , activate body´s protective mechanism thereby reduce heart injury . Several animal study use help understand mechanism behind process , trial human adult show optimistic result ; however evidence regard paediatric population limit necessary since child present different basal profile , risk requirement . The investigator propose randomized clinical trial assess efficacy RIPC provide protection injury heart organs child go cardiac surgery use CPB Royal Hospital Sick Children . The research project translational approach , integrate basic molecular mechanism clinical outcome . The investigator hope allow understand utilisation patient´s protective mechanism , reduce CPB-related injury ultimately improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>
