	<brief_summary>Rationale : The progressive loss skeletal muscle mass aging , sarcopenia , major impact healthcare system due increase morbidity great need hospitalization and/or institutionalization . One way prevent skeletal muscle loss improve dietary intake elderly . It already show ingestion dietary protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis inhibits muscle protein breakdown , result overall positive net protein balance . However , impact fat ( part meal ) dietary protein-induced muscle protein synthesis remain largely unknown . Based previous study research group , hypothesize fat stimulates muscle anabolic response protein ingestion . Objective : The primary objective study investigate effect single meal-like amount protein without fat postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate healthy elderly men . Furthermore , secondary objective , assess digestion absorption kinetics . Study design : double-blind randomize intervention study Study population : 24 healthy elderly men ( 55-85 ) Intervention : one group ( n=12 ) consume test beverage 350 mL contain 20 g intrinsically label casein , group ( n=12 ) consume beverage volume contain 20 g casein plus 20 g fat . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint : muscle protein synthesis rate . Secondary endpoint : digestion absorption kinetics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Fat Co-ingestion With Protein Post-prandial Anabolic Response Elderly Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The progressive loss skeletal muscle mass aging , sarcopenia , major impact healthcare system due increase morbidity great need hospitalization and/or institutionalization . The age-related loss skeletal muscle mass facilitate combination factor , include less optimal diet sedentary lifestyle . These factor contribute disruption regulation skeletal muscle protein turnover , lead imbalance muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) degradation . One way overcome problem improve dietary intake elderly . It well establish nutrient intake greatly affect protein turnover skeletal muscle tissue . Ingestion dietary protein stimulate MPS rate inhibits muscle protein breakdown rate , result overall positive net protein balance young elderly . However , clear impact co-ingestion macronutrients digestion absorption kinetics MPS rate healthy young elderly . We recently conduct study examine impact carbohydrate co-ingestion postprandial MPS healthy young old . Indeed , preliminary result show carbohydrate co-ingestion stimulates protein synthesis . Interestingly , little known impact fat co-ingestion protein stimulation post-prandial MPS rate . What noteworthy Elliot et al . investigated effect whole milk ingestion net muscle protein balance resistance exercise use arteriovenous balance approach . Ingestion whole milk ( contain 50 en % fat ) stimulate post-exercise net uptake phenylalanine threonine great extent ingestion fat-free milk ( contain 6 en % fat ) . Although , amino acid uptake indicative 'muscle anabolism ' , direct measure MPS firm conclusion deduce work . Furthermore , milk also contain certain amount carbohydrate ( fat-free milk 55 en % whole milk 30 en % ) , allow direct assessment fat co-ingestion per se . Certainly , study investigate effect long term fatty acid intake , use direct incorporation method , MPS rate . For example , long term omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) supplementation increase feeding-mediated MPS rate young , middle-aged , old adult . The mechanism ( ) underpinning enhanced effect n-3 PUFA supplementation post-prandial MPS rate dietary protein well define . It speculate enhanced feeding-effect n-3 PUFA postprandial MPS rate due remodel sarcolemma include great n-3 PUFA content , ultimately enhance insulin 's action muscle protein metabolism . This clearly long term effect , acute effect fat co-ingestion postprandial MPS rate ? Katsanos et al . find elevate plasma fatty acid concentration interfere post-prandial stimulation MPS . However , subject ingest single bolus essential amino acid receive fatty acid infusion , clearly reflect 'real world ' set . In end , reason believe presence fat meal stimulates muscle anabolic response meal ingestion . However , fat intake may also modulate gastric empty dietary protein digestion absorption kinetics . To date , acute ( long-term supplementation ) impact fat meal post-prandial muscle protein anabolism digestion absorption kinetics remain completely unexplored , thus speculate impact fat co-ingestion postprandial MPS rate . In present study investigate effect single meal-like amount protein without fat postprandial MPS healthy elderly men . Furthermore , assess digestion absorption kinetics . The use intrinsically label casein allow u determine de novo MPS amino acid come available test beverage .</detailed_description>
