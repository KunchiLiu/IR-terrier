	<brief_title>Continuous Femoral Tibial Nerve Blocks TKA Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare measure effect Ropivicaine give catheter locate femoral tibial nerve index sensory blockade total knee arthroplasty . This randomize , prospective study design address primary research question : Does place continuous femoral &amp; tibial catheter infusion lead superior analgesia patient satisfaction entire hospital stay ? The secondary research question : Will selectively place continuous tibial catheter decrease episodes transient foot drop zero ? Investigators know regional institutional practice perform continuous femoral single shot sciatic nerve block provide adequate analgesia entire leg , post-operative day 2 patient 's begin experience pain rehabilitation rest posterior-lateral aspect knee leg secondary wearing sciatic nerve block anesthetic . Also , know block sciatic nerve proximal bifurcation may lead episode transient foot drop due common peroneal nerve blockage irritation . It hypothesize placement continuous catheter femoral tibial nerve would provide good analgesia lead episode foot drop compare patient receive continuous femoral single shot sciatic block . Currently Texas Tech Health Science Center-El Paso University Medical Center , 95 % patient 's undergoing total knee arthroplasty 's ( TKAs ) receive continuous femoral infusion single shot sciatic initial bolus 30mL ( femoral ) 20mL ( sciatic ) Ropivicaine 0.5 % infusion Ropivicaine 0.2 % rate 10cc/hr ( usually start post-op ) least first 48-72 hour post-operatively . For study , Orthopedic clinic provide copy consent form subject review , interested participating study , patient contact Principal Investigator Study Coordinator directly . After informed consent obtain , patient randomize time use number system enclose sealed envelope . Group 1 receive pre-operative continuous femoral catheter post-operative single shot sciatic give initial bolus 30 mL ( femoral ) 0.5 % Ropivicaine 20mL ( sciatic ) 0.2 % Ropivicaine . Following surgery femoral infusion start , run Ropivicaine 0.2 10cc/hr . Group 2 receive pre-operative continuous femoral catheter post-operative continuous tibial catheter initial bolus 30 mL 0.5 % Ropivicaine ( femoral ) 20mL 0.2 % Ropivicaine ( tibial ) , follow infusion post-operatively run rate dosage group 1 . All nerve block perform place use nerve stimulator ( twitch low 0.2mA ) ultrasound-guidance . Proper catheter placement confirm inject 3mL air visualize ultrasound . Once confirm , bolus dose mention earlier either Ropivicaine 0.5 % ( femoral ) 0.2 % ( sciatic/tibial ) inject . All TKA case perform general anesthesia laryngeal mask airway . Considering fact place selective continuous tibial catheter pre-operatively , run risk catheter surgical field case . For reason , decide placement procedure would best . Therefore , patient take back block room post-operatively continuous tibial nerve catheter single shot ( depend group assign ) place bolused use technique previously describe . To detect 30 % reduction pain score 3-4 1-2 would require observed post-operative pain control difference . In order achieve statistically significant result detect previously observe difference , sample 38 patient group ( total 76 ) would require . Assuming high consent rate give fact many TKA 's project study complete approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>
