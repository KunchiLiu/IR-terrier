	<brief_summary>Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) form rapid irregular heart rhythm start upper chamber heart ( call atrium ) often associate many health problem . It cause stroke , palpitation heart failure . The management long stand ( chronic ) AF may require additional medication blood thinner , potentially life . It may also require procedure heart shock electrical current restore normal rhythm . Some patient require procedure call radiofrequency ablation address arrhythmia . The purpose registry collect information patient undergo combination procedure database , use information scientific study improve treatment atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
