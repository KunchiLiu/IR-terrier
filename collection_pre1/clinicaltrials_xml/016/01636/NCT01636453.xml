	<brief_summary>To assess safety effectiveness Penumbra Liberty Stent System adjunctive treatment embolic coil wide-neck , saccular , intracranial aneurysm internal carotid artery ( ICA ) . The Liberty Stent System implantable device comprise stent delivery system design adjunct embolic coil treatment wide-neck , saccular , intracranial aneurysm . It three component : implant , introducer sheath delivery wire assembly . The implant component make superelastic biocompatible nitinol tubular material . Patients present wide-neck , saccular , intracranial aneurysm internal carotid artery ( ICA ) cavernous segment carotid terminus ( include paraclinoid , ophthalmic , hypophyseal posterior communicate segment ) receive stent assist coil Penumbra Liberty Stent approve embolic coil currently market . Wide-neck aneurysm define neck ≥4mm dome-to-neck ratio &lt; 2 . Each patient follow assessed 2 , 6 12 month enrollment .</brief_summary>
