	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common lethal life shorten genetic disease cause mutation trans-membrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . The major cause morbidity mortality CF link process chronic inflammatory airway , lead progressive damage small bronchiole subsequently proximal bronchus . Cough back-up mechanism mucus clearance come effect health emergency situation , follow inhalation foreign body , lung disease often primary host defense clearance mechanism , namely mucociliany clearance , compromise Several study show connection weakness respiratory muscle CF deficit CFTR muscle ; sustain infection pseudomonas ; low normal tension time index low fat free mass [ 3-6 ] . Weakness respiratory muscle may insinuate insufficient cough CF patient . Effective cough initiate several mechanical stage : ) inhale variable amount air , b ) closure glottis , c ) contraction respiratory muscle , ) force expiration residual volume [ 7-13 ] A voluntary cough flow volume ( C-FVC ) profile therefore , incorporate characteristic force expiratory flow volume curve ( FEVC ) first `` spike '' represent peak cough flow , volume exhale cough corresponds vital capacity . The descend portion C-FVC include secondary spike decrease linear fashion lung volume go total lung capacity residual volume.10 similar FEVC flow decay . Any disturbance either cough stage may impair efficiency . The aim study explore information gain cough ability group CF patient , performance voluntary cough-flow-volume maneuver relation characteristic maximum expiratory flow-volume curve . Study plan How advance field ? In study wish evaluate first time cough ability derive voluntary cough flow volume curve detection insufficient cough patient CF . We hope show cough flow volume curve corresponds change cough ability patient relation lung function deterioration . What clinical implication ? An objective following-up cough ability deterioration may allow opportunity introduce special respiratory therapy strengthen cough ease secretion flow patient .</detailed_description>
