	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect age weight loss iron status immune response obese woman . Iron deficiency immune impairment two numerous complication obesity . The central hypothesis obesity-induced inflammation cause low iron status decrease iron absorption availability young old obese woman . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize correct weight loss young old obese woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Age Weight Loss Inflammation Iron Homeostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese individual chronic inflammation , high risk iron deficiency , impair immune response . These condition see also age , unknown extent may impact obesity elderly . With study investigator aim establish mechanism weight loss may reduce inflammation enhance iron status young old obese adult peptide hormone hepcidin , regulate iron homeostasis . The investigator also aim identify possible link iron homeostasis immune response hepcidin , implicate T cell mediate immunity . The investigator hypothesize obesity-induced inflammation cause dysregulation hepcidin expression lead low iron status decrease iron absorption availability young old adult . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize hepcidin dysregulation , thus iron status mitigate weight loss young old obese adult . This hypothesis test obese young old woman undergo weight loss calorie restriction . Change iron status , inflammation , hepcidin determine weight loss . Further , impact inflammatory environment obesity peripheral blood mononuclear cell hepcidin , ferroportin , intracellular iron , T cell function young old adult determine . This study address two important public health problem , i.e . obesity iron deficiency important step toward identification strategy enhance health obese young old adult .</detailed_description>

Gastrointestinal cancer . Hereditary hemochromatosis , blood disorder . Chronic infectious inflammatory disease . Use immunosuppressant . Severe iron deficiency anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl ) condition would prevent discontinue iron supplement use . Unwilling discontinue iron supplement intake . The dietary plan recommend WWC include daily intake iron meet iron RDA subject 's gender age group , therefore discontinue iron supplement harmful participant . Intake supplement exclusion criterion , long stay constant throughout study period .</criteria>
