	<brief_summary>The goal Phase 1 part clinical research study learn high tolerable dose cytarabine give tosedostat high tolerable dose 5-azacitidine give tosedostat patient AML MDS . The goal Phase 2 part study learn cytarabine tosedostat and/or 5-azacitidine tosedostat help control disease . The safety combination continue study . Tosedostat design block production proteins cancer cell need grow . Blocking protein may cause cancer cell die . Cytarabine design insert DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell stop DNA repairing . 5-azacitidine design block certain protein cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting protein . By block protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign receive cytarabine tosedostat ( Group 1 ) 5-azacitidine ( Group 2 ) . Your doctor decide drug receive . You assign study phase base join study . Up 2 group 18 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 60 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose cytarabine 5-azacitidine receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level cytarabine 5-azacitidine . The second group receive high dose cytarabine 5-azacitidine group , intolerable side effect see . If enrol Phase II portion , receive cytarabine 5-azacitidine high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level tosedostat . Study Drug Administration : In study receive induction therapy try control disease cause remission ( point test and/or doctor find sign disease ) . If disease remission , may receive cycle ( call Consolidation Cycles ) help keep disease control . Each study cycle 4 week long , may longer depend response study drug ( ) . Participants group take tosedostat mouth 1 time every day . You take pill time every day ( 24 hour dos ) meal meal . You may take drug water . You give study drug diary , record take dose . You complete diary every day bring study visit . You also bring unused tosedostat study visit include empty pot . You take assigned number capsule within 24-hour period . If accidentally take 1 day , tell study doctor right away . If miss dose morning take dose late afternoon ( 5pm ) . After time dose omit continue drug schedule usual following day . Do try `` make '' miss dose 5pm . If Group 1 , also receive cytarabine needle skin 2 time day Days 1-10 . If Group 2 , also receive 5-azacitidine vein 10-40 minute needle skin day Days 1-7 . After induction , amount tosedostat receive may increase . Your doctor may decide stop cytarabine 5-azacitidine continue tosedostat alone . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . vBlood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Your performance status record . - Your medical history record . - You ask drug may take . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 ( +/- 2 day ) : - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You ECG . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - On Day 8 , physical exam . - On Day 15 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PK testing . On Day 28 Cycle 1 ( +/- 5 day ) ( visit may combine Day 1 Cycle 2 visit ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PK testing . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - You ECG ECHO check heart function . - You bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond ( +/- 5 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - You ECG ECHO check heart function . - During Cycles 2 3 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn PK testing . - During odd-numbered cycle ( 3 , 5 , 7 ) , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . If study doctor feel need , may extra clinic visit , test , procedure . Participants Receiving Home Care : If receive first cycle home , call Day 14 ( +/- 5 day ) Cycle 1 asked side effect may . This call take 15 minute . If receive home care , return MD Anderson start cycle During Cycles 1-3 , every 3 cycle ( +/- 1 cycle ) 1 year start therapy , every 6 month ( +/- 1 month ) . Length Study : You may take study drug 1 year . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect , able follow study direction , study doctor think best interest . Your participation study complete follow-up . Follow-Up : About 28 day last dose tosedostat : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You ECG ECHO check heart function . - You ask side effect may drug may take . Once complete follow-up visit , study staff may contact telephone every 3-6 month check status health . Keeping touch checking condition help researcher look long-term effect study drug . This investigational study . Tosedostat FDA approve commercially available . At time , tosedostat use research . Cytarabine FDA approve commercially available certain type MDS AML . 5-azacitidine FDA approve commercially available certain type MDS AML . Up 96 patient take part study . All patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
