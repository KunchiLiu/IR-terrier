	<brief_title>Reliability Measuring Conditioned Pain Modulation With Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic pain characterize change central process sensory input . Quantitative sensory test ( QST ) explore central excitability human potential detect alter central pain process individual patient . QST develop assess response sensory stimuli research purpose , provide psychophysical electrophysiological method assessment nociceptive system . Reliability essential condition use QST research clinical practice . It define consistency measurement across time , patient observer , extent error-free . Three category assess reliability QST measure : intra-rater , inter-rater test-retest reliability . Reliability QST measure healthy volunteer encourage regard good repeatability QST measure time subject . Inter-rater reliability , prerequisite compare different measure different study , also highly encouraging . Under normal condition , pain application test nociceptive stimulus attenuate application additional `` conditioning '' noxious stimulus remote body region , reflect diffuse endogenous inhibition . This define conditioned pain modulation ( CPM ) , also know `` pain inhibits pain '' paradigm . CPM object much work last year . It go back exploration endogenous analgesia via descend pain-modulatory system , start three decade ago animal model . Descending inhibitory pathway cerebral control , mediate modulation pain perception emotional , motivational cognitive factor . Alterations CPM know risk factor concern acute chronic pain syndrome . Very reliability study CPM conduct date . To knowledge , S. Cathcart et al use occlusion cuff algometry pressure pain detection ass test-retest reliability healthy volunteer . A study chronic pain patient group show great variability CPM . It unclear whether phenomenon relate high interindividual variability CPM measure , poor reliability . In analysis data extract pharmacological study , CPM measure three different session patient low back pain display poor reliability . The nociceptive withdrawal reflex electrophysiological measure . Compared psychophysical measure rely subject 's pain perception , reflex could reproducible stable measure time . Objective The primary aim present study assess reliability CPM use nociceptive withdrawal reflex test stimulus ice water test conditioning stimulus 34 consecutive patient , 7 day interval two session . Secondary aim compare reliability CPM nociceptive withdrawal reflex reliability CPM assess subjective pain assessment , i.e . pain threshold pain intensity electrical stimulation . Methods Repeated assessment CPM use nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold , electrical pain detection threshold suprathreshold electrical stimulation skin , ice-water conditioning stimulus three model . There 7 day interval two measurement .</detailed_description>
