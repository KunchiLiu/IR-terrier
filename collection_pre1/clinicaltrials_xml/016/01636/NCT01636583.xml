	<brief_summary>A water purify system , call LifeStrawFamily ( LSF ) , able fortify water zinc concentration 4 mg/l develop . The aim study investigate whether LSF strategy advantageous term zinc absorption compare food fortification . This study want demonstrate whether aqueous zinc produce LSF device consume within outside meal well absorb zinc enrich cereal-based staple food healthy adult . In addition , zinc absorption LSF-enriched water fortify inhibitory cereal-based pudding compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Zinc bioavailability food diet depend content zinc presence inhibitor zinc absorption , e.g . inositol phosphate , also know phytic acid ( PA ) , typically estimate phytate zinc molar ratio ( Phy : Zn ) . A zinc absorption 10-15 % estimate diet contain mainly unrefined cereal grain legumes negligible amount animal protein , dominant develop country ( characterised Phy : Zn &gt; 15 ) . For comparison , mixed animal plant product diet ( Phy : Zn range 5-15 ) estimate average zinc bioavailability 20-30 % whereas diet ample refine cereal rich animal food ( Phy : Zn &lt; 5 ) would average zinc bioavailability 30-50 % ( 12 , 19 ) . Fractional absorption aqueous zinc sulphate zinc chloride solution take fast state show range 56-74 % dose 0.5-10 mg zinc ( 20-24 ) decrease 37-62 % dose 13-30.1 mg zinc ( 22 , 24 ) . Zinc drinking water consume away meal appear substantially good absorb composite food . Alternative strategy , design provide zinc water supply , could prove useful global effort control zinc deficiency . To investigate whether zinc elute Lifestraw FamilyÂ® ( LSF ) device via specific zinc delivery system bioavailable zinc fortify cereal zinc sulphate , perform human absorption study base double isotopic tracer ratio technique . The fractional absorption zinc ( FAZ ) LSF-fortified water consume without food compare FAZ fortify cereal . This allow quantifying zinc bioavailability LSF elute zinc 1 ) LSF-water consume fast state 2 ) LSF-water consume together food 3 ) compare latter two zinc absorption zinc fortify cereal . The result study provide information potential advantage LSF fortification zinc food fortification , currently recommend delivery vehicle zinc country fortification program ( 25 , 26 ) . Furthermore , compare zinc bioavailability LSF-water consume alone combination food instruct optimal way consume . This information use optimally design delivery strategy plan efficacy trial . In future , information could also integrate information recommendation use prospective end-consumers .</detailed_description>
