	<brief_summary>Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) use treatment labor pain 150 year . The longevity use clinical practice attribute excellent safety profile , ease administration , familiarity use among health-care provider . Sedara self-administered 50 % N2O , 50 % oxygen gas mixture pain relieve anxiety reduce property recently available use United States ( US ) treat various painful clnical situation , include labor pain . In US , epidural intravenous administration narcotic medication one common frequently request treatment patient experience labor pain . Although generally consider safe , complication common epidural , include fetal distress , low blood pressure mother , respiratory distress , headache .

Because Sedara recently unavailable US , study compare efficacy agent labor pain confine Europe , predominantly United Kingdom . Several study investigate efficacy Sedara versus inhalation intravenous anesthetic various country . We obtain several Sedara device use West Penn Allegheny Health System ( WPAHS ) Department Anesthesiology would like examine efficacy target population woman experience pain early labor . Hypothesis - Sedara provide equivalent superior pain relief among term , adult parturients early labor ( le 5cm cervical dilation ) compare intravenous butorphanol . Primary aim - Compare Sedara versus butorphanol single-blinded randomized trial main outcome measure reduction labor pain various time interval .
