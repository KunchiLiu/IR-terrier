	<brief_summary>This project design use MRI evaluate pre- post-arthroplasty hip ; specific aim project three-fold . First , investigator intend compare amount muscle atrophy tendon damage occur around hip two commonly-used operative approach : direct-anterior approach posterior approach . Second , investigator aim provide baseline data amount muscle atrophy tendon damage reasonably expect occur approach . Third , investigator document degree recovery periprosthetic soft tissue post-surgery patient group . The investigator first hypothesis posterior approach demonstrate significantly damage abductor , piriformis , short external rotators direct anterior approach , demonstrate minimal soft tissue damage . The investigator second hypothesis surgical approach cause degree baseline muscle damage atrophy , predictable pattern . The investigator third hypothesis surgical approach inherently cause degree soft tissue damage , periprosthetic soft tissue incise surgical exposure recover predictable pattern consistent unique within group</brief_summary>
