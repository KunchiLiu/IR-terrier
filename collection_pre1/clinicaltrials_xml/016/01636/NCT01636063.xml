	<brief_summary>Surgical abortion late first trimester early second trimester usually perform aid cervical preparing agent , help open uterine cervix procedure . Routine use cervical preparants recommend several organization period pregnancy surgical abortion , especially young woman deliver baby , cervix may difficult dilate without preparant . The standard medication use cervical preparation misoprostol . Unfortunately , misoprostol may cause uncomfortable uterine cramp vaginal bleeding patient use . Another medication call mifepristone show dilate cervix well misoprostol first trimester , little information exist use mifepristone late first trimester early second trimester . The investigator plan perform prospective , double-blind , randomized trial evaluate mifepristone well cervical preparant misoprostol . A total 110 participant pregnant woman desire pregnancy termination 11 15 week gestational age recruit . Half receive mifepristone half misoprostol . The investigator measure amount cervical dilation achieve right surgical abortion determine mifepristone significantly different misoprostol cervical preparant stage pregnancy . The investigator expect mifepristone work well misoprostol purpose . The investigator hope generate information mifepristone woman health care provider know mifepristone option cervical preparation surgical abortion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone Versus Misoprostol Cervical Preparation Prior Surgical Abortion Between 11 15 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use prospective , double-blind , randomized clinical trial design . As main objective determine whether one pharmacological method cervical preparation effective population , appropriate study design . A double-blinded , randomized trial allow maximal prevention bias affect study result . The study structure two-tailed comparison , possible mifepristone significantly less effective misoprostol effect initial cervical dilation . While previous study indicate mifepristone superior misoprostol regard , study focus later gestational age range . Therefore , believe one-tailed comparison would inappropriate test whether difference mifepristone misoprostol cervical preparing agent gestational age range . We enroll approximately 50 subject 11 0/7 15 0/7 week GA seek abortion randomize two group 1:1 ratio . Group A subject receive mifepristone 200 mg capsulize orally time preoperative visit give two folic acid tablet ( misoprostol placebo ) place buccally day procedure . Group B subject receive empty capsule ( mifepristone placebo ) orally time preoperative visit give two misoprostol 200 mcg tablet place buccally day procedure . To preserve blinding , place mifepristone capsule provide BMC IDS . Subjects receive mifepristone receive identically-appearing empty capsule . The study take place Boston Medical Center 's outpatient Women 's Care Center . Preoperative appointment take place Pre-Procedure Unit ( PPU ) abortion appointment take place Gynecology Procedures Unit ( GPU ) . Patients seek abortion service BMC constitute population source study sample . Because seek investigate mifepristone misoprostol cervical preparants population woman seek abortion service , appropriate population sample . Patients eligible enroll subject investigation identify clinical provider see preoperative visit . Approximately 20 patient per month see clinic meet criterion inclusion study . The provider describe study briefly potential subject , interested , provider contact study staff . The staff member describe study great detail obtain informed consent take part study . Subject allocation treatment group double-blind . The Boston Medical Center Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) prepackage study medication random order sequentially number package . We enroll approximately 110 subject 11 0/7 15 0/7 week GA seek abortion allocate randomly two equal group subject . Group A subject receive capsule contain mifepristone 200 mg orally time preoperative visit give two folic acid tablet ( misoprostol placebo ) place buccally day procedure . Group B subject receive empty capsule ( mifepristone placebo ) orally time preoperative visit give two misoprostol 200 mcg tablet place buccally day procedure . It important note investigation use cervical preparants similar fashion already standard practice BMC . Mifepristone ingestion directly observe clinic provider , misoprostol dispense preoperative visit patient place buccally approximately 3 hour abortion procedure . Patients 11 12 week GA receive 400 mcg misoprostol buccally three hour prior procedure preparant , discretion surgeon . For patient 12 14 week GA , 400 mcg buccal misoprostol three hour prior procedure standard preparant . Patients 14 15 week GA aforementioned misoprostol dose option , instead also elect receive mifepristone 200 mg orally 24 36 hour abortion procedure . Patients 14 15 week GA also elect receive osmotic dilator cervical preparant method . Therefore , agent use study familiar clinician already use patient facility similar fashion . Enrolled subject give study subject number corresponds treatment group assignment , determine advance BMC IDS random fashion . The clinic provider study staff member blind assignment , subject . While study conduct , BMC IDS access study subject treatment assignment . The clinic provider study staff observe subject take first study agent ( mifepristone placebo ) . In order preserve blinding , BMC IDS provide indistinguishable capsule mifepristone empty capsule . They direct patient place second study agent ( misoprostol placebo ) buccally approximately three hour abortion procedure . This time correspond 6 morning procedure 10 afternoon procedure . To preserve provider blinding , second study agent opaque package . The BMC IDS unable provide indistinguishable version misoprostol folic acid plan buccal use . Despite , anticipate significant threat subject blinding . In order ensure abortion provider blinding , clinic provider study staff member enroll subject eligible perform subject 's abortion . At subject 's preoperative visit , follow data collect : Study subject number ; date ; age ; race/ethnicity ; ultrasound-confirmed gestational age ; gravidity ; parity ; time first study agent ingestion ; history prior live birth ; history prior pregnancy loss ; history prior elective abortion ; history cervical dysplasia treatment procedure ( cold knife cone , LEEP , cryotherapy ) . A checklist aforementioned exclusion criterion present preoperative data sheet prevent enrollment subject meet criterion . One follow-up visit plan subject : abortion procedure appointment , occur 24 48 hour ingestion first study agent . At encounter , outcome variable measure collect data analysis . Once subject arrives GPU , study staff member confirm record time buccal placement second study agent . The subject undergo routine intake process abortion patient GPU , include preoperative safety screening register nurse . After intake process , patient undergo abortion procedure sooner three hour buccal placement second study agent . For procedural anesthesia analgesia , patient receive care GPU two choice . They may choose receive IV conscious sedation , consist midazolam fentanyl addition lidocaine paracervical block . The alternative IM ketorolac lidocaine paracervical block . Study participant afford choice abortion patient . The abortion perform , include assessment initial cervical dilation , describe . The subject remain GPU recovery area meet criteria discharge , consistent guideline place patient receive care GPU . To measure initial cervical dilation , Pratt mechanical dilator use . Starting 43F Pratt dilator , attempt make pas sequentially small diameter dilator dilator pass without resistance . The size large dilator pas without resistance record initial cervical dilation value . Using dilator large small avoid cause dilation measurement initial cervical dilation . This method measure initial cervical dilation describe publish study , include Goldberg , et al . ( 19 ) Physicians perform abortion patient within study train conduct measurement initial cervical dilation standard fashion . All abortion perform attend OB-GYN physician family planning fellows limit confound due provider inexperience part resident medical student . The data collect include date time buccal placement second study agent ; subject 's experience preoperative vaginal bleeding , nausea , vomit diarrhea ; preoperative pain score ; anesthesia/analgesia agent use dos use ; initial cervical dilation ; amount additional dilation need perform procedure ; intraoperative pain score ; duration procedure ( speculum speculum time ) ; postoperative pain score ; patient satisfaction ; provider rating difficulty procedure . Complications , , procedure also note .</detailed_description>
