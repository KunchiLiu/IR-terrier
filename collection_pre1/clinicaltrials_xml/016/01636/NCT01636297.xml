	<detailed_description>Current medical surgical approach Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) expensive associate variety side effect may compromise patient 's quality life . Development non-drug , non-surgical therapeutic approach improve motor function would provide attractive adjunct current PD treatment approach . Promising result animal exercise study translate patient PD . Animal study suggest forced-exercise produce endogenous increase neurotrophic factor . An increase factor believe improve capacity dopamine neuron deliver dopamine selectively increase dopamine level within dorsolateral striatum . Models PD provide theoretical framework forced-exercise explain voluntary exercise associate global improvement motor function PD patient . Based model prediction , decrease motor cortical activation limit PD patient ' ability perform voluntary exercise relatively high rate use animal study demonstrate therapeutic benefit . Therefore , PD patient may able exercise ( voluntarily ) sufficiently high rate trigger endogenous release neurotrophic factor think underlie global improvement motor functioning . A safe low extremity forced-exercise paradigm augments PD patient voluntary exercise rate develop human ongoing R21 project . Similar initial study , PD patient complete 8-week forced-exercise intervention exhibit nearly 25 % percent improvement clinical motor rating , patient complete voluntary exercise intervention show improvement clinical rating . Our recent fMRI data indicate acute bout forced-exercise PD patient produce similar subcortical cortical activation pattern see follow administration levodopa . Global improvement motor function increase neural activity suggest forced-exercise may alter brain function PD patient . The goal project determine compare effect force versus voluntary exercise PD motor non-motor function associate change pattern neural activity . A single-center , parallel-group , rater-blind , study 2:2:1 randomization propose . A total 100 mild moderate idiopathic PD patient randomize voluntary , forced no-exercise control group . Exercise group exercise identical aerobic intensity , however force group provide mechanical assistance perform exercise 35 % fast voluntary exercise rate .</detailed_description>
