	<brief_summary>This 24-week , phase III multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . The study 9 schedule visit telephone contact Follow-up visit one week follow end study treatment . The study primary endpoint -Clinic visit trough ( pre-bronchodilator pre-dose ) FEV1 Treatment Day 169 Trough FEV1 Treatment Day 169 define mean FEV1 value obtain 23 24 hour dose Treatment Day 168 ( i.e . Week 24 visit ) . Secondary endpoint ; - Mean TDI focal score Week 24 - Weighted mean clinic visit FEV1 0 6 hour post-dose Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) Eligible subject randomise GSK573719/GW642444 125/25mcg , GSK573719/GW642444 62.5/25mcg placebo treatment group 1:1:1 ratio plan 573 total number randomise subject , approximately 191 subject randomise active treatment group 191 subject randomise placebo . All treatment administer daily morning inhalation use Novel Dry Powder Inhaler ( NDPI ) . There total 9 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit.1 ) complete 7 14 day Run-In period follow 24-week Treatment period . Clinic visit screen , Randomisation ( Day1 ) , Day2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24-weeks treatment , 1 day Week 24 Visit ( also refer Treatment Day 169 ) . A Follow-Up contact adverse event assessment conduct telephone approximately 7 day Visit 9 Early Withdrawal Visit . The total duration subject participation , include Follow-up approximately 27 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use `` as-needed '' basis throughout Run-In Study Treatment Periods . At screen , pre-bronchodilator spirometry perform follow post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry test . Post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 FEV1/FVC value use determine subject eligibility . To characterise bronchodilator responsiveness , post ipratropium test conduct follow completion post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry . Spirometry conduct post-randomisation clinic visit . Six hour post-dose serial spirometry conduct Visit 2 . Trough spirometry obtain 23 24 hour previous day 's dose blind study medication Visits 3 9 . Assessments dyspnea obtain use Baseline Transition Dyspnoea Index ( BDI/TDI ) interviewer base instrument . At Visit 2 , severity dyspnoea baseline assess use BDI . At subsequent visit ( Visits 4 , 6 , 8 ) change baseline assess use TDI . Administration BDI TDI do prior spirometry study-related procedure Disease specific health status evaluate use St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) , baseline ( Visit 2 ) Visits 4 , 6 8 . The occurrence adverse event evaluate throughout study begin Visit 2 . SAEs collect time period AEs . However , SAEs assess related study participation ( e.g. , study treatment , protocol-mandated procedure , invasive test , change exist therapy ) relate GSK concomitant medication , record time subject consent participate study include follow contact . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) , 12-lead ECGs standard clinical laboratory test ( hematology blood biochemistry ) obtain select clinic visit . For determination subject disposition , subject consider complete study , upon completion Visit 9 . There plan provide active study treatment compassionate use follow study completion . The Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) population primary population interest , define randomised subject receive least one dose randomise study medication Treatment Period . Supplementary study conduct information mandate present protocol provide accompany Study Procedures Manual ( SPM ) . The SPM provide site personnel administrative detailed technical information impact subject safety .</brief_summary>
