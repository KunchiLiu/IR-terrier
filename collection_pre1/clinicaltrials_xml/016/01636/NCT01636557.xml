	<brief_summary>The main purpose study evaluate potential effect single dose sirukumab pharmacokinetics ( body drug ) study agent specific cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes ( CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP1A2 ) patient active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . This study also assess safety tolerability single subcutaneous ( SC , skin ) dose sirukumab patient active RA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Single Dose CNTO 136 ( Sirukumab ) CYP450 Enzyme Activities After Subcutaneous Administration Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( patient study personnel know identity administer study agent ) , multi-center , drug-drug interaction study . Approximately 18 patient may enrol study , one treatment group . All patient receive single subcutaneous ( SC ) dose sirukumab . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme-specific study agent ( 5-probe cocktail ) consist oral dos midazolam , warfarin/vitamin K , omeprazole , caffeine administer 4 separate occasion throughout study . A blood sample CYP genetic analysis ( genotyping ) collect screen prospective patient determine eligibility study . Participation CYP genotyping prescreening mandatory patient . The CYP genotyping blood sample use additional genetic research destroy completion study . The total duration study participation approximately 12 week patient include study , include screen visit 4 week prior first study agent administration . Patients five in-patient period , four consist 3 day 2 night one consist 2 day 1 night . Patients safety monitor throughout study , approximately 7 week safety follow-up sirukumab administration .</detailed_description>
