	<brief_title>Sorafenib Thoracic Radiation Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Sorafenib design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein , active , part responsible growth behavior cancer cell . Study Drug : Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 30 participant enrol Phase II . Phase II participant receive sorafenib high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive type amount radiation . Study Drug Administration : Participants take sorafenib capsule 1-2 time every day begin Day 1 radiation therapy . Participants take study drug 2 time day . Participants take study drug without food ( 1 hour 2 hour eat ) . Radiation Therapy : Before receive radiation therapy , participant `` mark session '' . At visit , participant compute tomography ( CT ) scan use help plan radiation therapy . This take 45 minute . Before receive radiation , participant also single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) scan lung . The participant give 15 radiation treatment , day , 5 day week , Monday-Friday . Each treatment take 30 minute . He sign separate consent form radiation therapy procedure describe detail . Clinical Visits : Participant routine clinical visit every week receive radiation therapy . The information collect clinical visit use study . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - Participant ask side effect may experience new drug may take . - Participant ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant test doctor feel medically necessary Urine collect every week take sorafenib receive radiation therapy routine test . End-of-Study Visit : Participant end-of-study visit 4-6 week Participant stop receive radiation . At visit , Participant CT scan check status disease . Follow-Up Visits : Participant 's first follow-up visit 6 week ( +/- 7 day ) radiation therapy second follow-up appointment 10 week ( +/- 7 day ) radiation therapy . Participant follow visit every 3 month . At visit , Participant go though following : - A complete medical history record . - Participant physical exam , include measurement weight blood pressure . - Participant ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - Participant ask drug may take . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Participant also chest x-ray . - Participant compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest area . - The location , type , size measurable lesion record . - If doctor think necessary , Participant positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan . - If doctor think necessary , Participant electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - Participant may lung perfusion scan see region lung equally functional . This call lung SPECT scan . - Participant lung functional test ( PFT ) doctor think necessary . All test routine examination he/she would without participate study order know status disease . This investigational study . Sorafenib FDA approve commercially available renal cell carcinoma . The radiation therapy schedule use study standard treatment lung cancer patient . The use sorafenib radiation therapy investigational .</detailed_description>
