	<brief_summary>This study look biological effect domestic violence abuse ( DVA ) woman 's mental health . The mechanism DVA cause mental disorder poorly understood . Similar demand , DVA activate biological stress system , chief component hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , produce chemical cortisol . Cortisol level increase response short-term demand help organisms deal change process get energy food also mental function . However constant activation HPA axis cause damage accelerate disease . This study test hypothesis compare non-abused woman abuse victim alter diurnal rhythm cortisol secretion pattern alteration predict abuse characteristic , type , severity , duration , cessation . To examine hypothesis follow research question address : 1 ) whether cortisol level relate mental health state ; 2 ) whether cortisol level relate type , severity , duration cessation DVA ; 3 ) whether difference cortisol concentration woman expose childhood abuse DVA experience latter ; 4 ) whether cortisol level vary woman , live refuge live refuge ? To answer research question 214 woman recruit domestic violence agency . Baseline 3-monthly follow-up measure take 6 month recruitment . Women ask fill questionnaire evaluate demographic , health , experience childhood abuse DVA . Women 's weight height take . In addition participant ask take three saliva sample : 1st evening bed , 2nd - next morning immediately upon awaken , 3rd - thirty minute awaken . Saliva collect chew ( 2 minute ) cotton pledget provide plastic tube return post via collection researcher . Then saliva sample test cortisol cortisone . Results study increase understanding biological mechanism DVA impact woman 's health tell researcher practitioner possibility use cortisol indicator diagnose abuse-related health problem assess effectiveness medical care abuse survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Domestic violence abuse ( DVA ) threaten behavior , violence abuse ( psychological , physical , sexual , financial emotional ) use one person control . Life time prevalence DVA 28 % woman 18 % men , although severity consequence abuse less men ( 1 ) . Over damage physical reproductive health DVA long-term detrimental effect mental health woman consult primary care ( 2 , 3 ) . A meta-analysis study measure relationship DVA mental disorder report increased risk depression , anxiety , psychosomatic disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , alcohol abuse , suicidal behavior ( 4 ) . Kernic et al ( 5 ) establish cessation DVA among survivor associate decreased prevalence depression ; whereas Anderson Sounders ( 6 ) find woman abusive relationship may great psychological difficulty still . However mechanisms DVA cause mental disease poorly understood . Similar stressor , DVA activate biological stress system , principal component hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , produce cortisol . Chronic activation system result dendritic retraction hippocampal loss function ( 7 , 8 ) . The result exist cross-sectional study test impact DVA woman 's HPA axis function contradictory . Pico-Alfonso et al ( 9 ) report increase cortisol level , whilst Seedat et al ( 10 ) establish reduction cortisol level DVA subject compare control . This disparity may relate differential development PTSD and/or depression within DVA-exposed sample ( 11 ) . Currently , hypothesis DVA survivor may characterize alteration HPA axis ( 12 ) longitudinal study need identify specific stress system disturbance group ( 1 , 13 ) . The aim study increase understanding role hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis activity DVA impact woman 's mental health . Study objective : - To evaluate profile awaken response cortisol , diurnal variation mean salivary cortisol concentration woman experience DVA non-abused control - To estimate whether cortisol secretion associate type , severity , duration cessation DVA - To investigate whether cortisol act mediator DVA mental health state - To examine whether distinction cortisol level woman expose childhood abuse DVA experience latter - To explore whether cortisol secretion differs woman , live domestic violence refuge/safe house still live community ( adjustment confounding effect abuse severity continue contact abuser ) . This 6-month study consist 3 measurement every 3 month . Each assessment last approximately 30-45 minute include : 1 . Numerous standardized self-administered psychological questionnaire 2 . Weight height measurement 3 . Self-completion 3 saliva sample use Salivette tube : 1. even sample - bedtime 2. awaken sample - morning immediately upon waken 3. post-awakening sample - 30 min awaken sample Tubes saliva return post researcher accredit laboratory cortisol assay . The analysis also simultaneously measure cortisone breakdown product cortisol . This measurement use confirm integrity sample .</detailed_description>
