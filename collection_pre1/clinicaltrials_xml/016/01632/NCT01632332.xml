	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Treated Stage II-III HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile peptide-based vaccine target HER-2/neu , patient stage II/III HER-2 positive breast cancer . II . To determine ability vaccination protocol elicit immune response measure activated HER-2/neu-specific T lymphocytes high-affinity antibody . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compile descriptive follow-up data regard vital status disease recurrence . II . To determine HER-2/neu peptide 885 generates T cell response specific HER-2/neu cross-reactive epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) protein . III . To determine human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -DR epitope contain HLA class I embed epitope . OUTLINE : Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally ( ID ) every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 additional year .</detailed_description>
