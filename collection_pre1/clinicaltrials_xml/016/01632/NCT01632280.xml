	<brief_summary>In project investigator aim improve eat control weight loss outcomes patient undergo LAGB innovative brain-based intervention . Specifically , investigator enhance activity right inferior frontal gyrus , core region brain circuit inhibitory control , use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement Brain Circuit Inhibitory Control Obese Patients Undergoing Gastric Banding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding ( LAGB ) minimally invasive reversible procedure bariatric surgery good safety record . Despite advantage , success rate follow LAGB quite variable across individual . Recent data suggest complement LAGB intervention target factor along brain-behavior spectrum could enhance weight loss result following procedure . The study follow three aim : Aim # 1 : To evaluate whether enhancement right inferior frontal gyrus tDCS patient undergo LAGB improve inhibitory control capacity . For aim investigator evaluate participant ' performance computerize test inhibitory control . Results aim provide evidence target engagement , thus confirm brain circuit interest affect result intervention . Aim # 2 : To examine whether enhancement right inferior frontal gyrus tDCS patient undergo LAGB lead improvement self-reported measure eat control ( disinhibition subscale three-factor eat questionnaire ) . Results form aim provide evidence effect intervention intermediate , behavioral variable . Aim # 3 : To preliminary evaluate whether enhancement right inferior frontal gyrus tDCS patient undergo LAGB improve postoperative weight loss outcomes . This aim provide preliminary evidence clinical efficacy intervention time window period 12 month . Weight loss 12 month primary outcome study .</detailed_description>
