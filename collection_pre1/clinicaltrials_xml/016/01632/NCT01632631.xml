	<brief_summary>Ongoing technological advance , especially field image processing , refine medical simulation offer life-like replication medical surgical procedure variety specialty . Patient-specific image data incorporate simulation , transform 3D model . This enable practitioner his/her team perform practice 'real ' case virtual patient prior perform real procedure actual patient . This new technology refer 'patient-specific ' rehearsal , also 'mission ' 'procedure ' rehearsal . Research already proven simulated patient-specific rehearsal carotid artery stenting procedure may enhance surgical team performance . The PROcedure rehearsal software also use practice patient-specific endovascular repair infrarenal aortic aneurysm ( EVAR ) . The ability rehearse challenge complex procedure like EVAR may influence device selection base preoperative planning , also improve technical performance surgeon/radiologist awareness communication within entire endovascular team . However , research need evaluate new technology may enhance clinical safety efficiency , i.e . patient actually benefit physician team member conduct patient-specific rehearsal EVAR intervention .</brief_summary>
