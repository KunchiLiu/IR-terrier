	<detailed_description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) common form renal cystic disease , affect ethnic group incidence 1 400 1.000 . In Austria estimate 8.000 21.000 people , estimate 670.000 1.675.000 people worldwide affect ADPKD , although statement 6.000.000 affected individual make . ADPKD responsible 5 10 percent patient chronic hemodialysis . Individuals ADPKD usually present 3rd 4th decade life , progress end-stage renal disease within 5 10 year onset renal insufficiency . Usually renal replacement therapy , either chronic dialysis renal transplantation , becomes necessary . Currently treatment ADPKD blood pressure control supportive care . Thus , novel therapy ADPKD great importance . The formation cysts ADPKD follow mutation locate within either polycystic kidney disease 1 -2 gene chromosome 16 4 , cod polycystin 1 ( PC1 ) -2 ( PC2 ) , respectively . PC1 PC2 member polycystin family integral membrane protein . PC1 act G-protein couple receptor suggest mediate cell-cell cell-matrix interaction . PC2 act nonselective cation channel suppose act ion exchange mechanism . Among pathways PC1 2 function via mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway , essential protein translation , cell proliferation -growth . Inhibition mTOR-pathway reduce kidney enlargement rodent polycystic kidney disease model show reduce volume cyst human polycystic kidney- polycystic liver disease . Thus , hypothesize mTOR inhibitor sirolimus , immunosuppressant drug strong anti-proliferative effect , delay progression renal insufficiency patient ADPKD advance stage disease . Before conduct large multicenter randomize control trial population demonstrate therapy mTOR-I accelerate decline renal function ( natural course disease ) , well mTOR-I aggravate prevalent- , cause new onset proteinuria , express protein/creatinine ratio , patient ADPKD eGFR 20 40 mL/min per 1.73sqm , compare historic cohort patient ADPKD eGFR 20 40 mL/min per 1.73sqm , treat Department Medicine III , Division Nephrology Dialysis , Medical University Vienna .</detailed_description>
