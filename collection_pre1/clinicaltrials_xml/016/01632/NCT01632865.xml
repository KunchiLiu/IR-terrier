	<brief_title>Recanalization Stenting Non-acute Veterbrobasilar Artery Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic stroke account 87 % cerebrovascular accident . Of , part result intracranial veterbrobasilar occlusion . Acute veterbrobasilar artery occlusion devastate disease high mortality without successful treatment . A subset patient survive acute phase develop subacute chronic veterbrobasilar artery occlusion . Due adequacy collateral , patient live without mild symptom . On contrast , lack enough collateral , another patient still present recurrent ischemic event progressive disability despite intensive medical therapy . Prognosis extremely poor . It cohort subacute chronic revascularization often consider . The optimal treatment cohort non-acute veterbrobasilar artery occlusion unknown , little literature guide therapy . Extracranial-intracranial bypass may revascularize intracranial artery occlusion . However , bypass procedure technically challenge associate significant risk morbidity mortality . Recurrent ischemic symptom despite best medical treatment indication endovascular revascularization stent remodel . This study evaluate technical feasibility , safety treatment effect recanalization stenting veterbrobasilar subacute-chronic intracranial artery occlusion。</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Stroke TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) due intracranial veterbrobasilar artery occlusion . 2 . Occlusions may diagnose TCD ( transcranial cerebral doppler ) , MRA ( magnetic resonance angiography ) , CTA ( compute tomographic angiography ) qualify angiogram perform part study protocol must confirm catheter angiography enrollment trial 3 . Time imagingdocumented occlusion and/or aggravation clinical symptom ( aggravation define change mRS [ modify rankin scale ] ≥1 and/or NIHSS [ national institute health stroke scale ] ≥4 ) recanalization great 24 hour . The reason delay intervention due delay diagnosis , interhospital transfer , unsuccessful initial trial anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy . 4 . Etiology suitable stenting , judge least neurologist , neurosurgeon neurointerventionalist . 1 . Unsuitable etiology . 2 . Stenting , angioplasty , endarterectomy extracranial ( carotid vertebral artery ) intracranial artery within 30 day prior expect enrollment date 3 . Any aneurysm without treatment proximal distal occlude intracranial artery 4 . Intracranial tumor ( except meningioma ) intracranial vascular malformation 5 . CT angiographic evidence severe calcification target lesion 6 . Brain infarct within previous 30 day enrollment sufficient size ( &gt; 5 cm ) risk hemorrhagic conversion stenting 7 . Any hemorrhagic infarct within 14 day prior enrollment 8 . Any hemorrhagic infarct within 15 30 day associate mass effect 9 . Any history primary intracerebral ( parenchymal ) hemorrhage ( ICH ) 10 . Any intracranial hemorrhage ( subarachnoid , subdural , epidural ) within 30 day 11 . Any untreated chronic subdural hematoma great 5 mm thickness 12 . Presence follow unequivocal cardiac source embolism : chronic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , mitral stenosis , mechanical valve , endocarditis , intracardiac clot vegetation , myocardial infarction within three month , dilate cardiomyopathy , leave atrial spontaneous echo contrast , ejection fraction le 30 % 13 . Known allergy contraindication aspirin , clopidogrel , heparin , metal , local general anesthesia 14 . History lifethreatening allergy contrast dye . 15 . Active peptic ulcer disease , major systemic hemorrhage within 30 day , active bleeding diathesis , platelet &lt; 100,000 , hematocrit &lt; 30 , INR [ international normalize ratio ] &gt; 1.5 , clot factor abnormality increase risk bleeding , current alcohol substance abuse , uncontrolled severe hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg diastolic pressure &gt; 115 mm Hg ) , severe liver impairment ( AST [ aspartate transaminate ] ALT [ alanine transaminase ] &gt; 3 x normal , cirrhosis ) , creatinine &gt; 3.0 ( unless dialysis ) 16 . Major surgery ( include open femoral , aortic , carotid surgery ) within previous 30 day plan next 90 day enrollment 17 . Pregnancy childbearing potential unwilling use contraception duration study 18 . Life expectancy＜1 year due medical condition . 19 . Enrollment another study would conflict current study 20 . Other special condition consider neurological physician , neurosurgeon neurointervention doctor , n't suitable recanalization procedure .</criteria>
