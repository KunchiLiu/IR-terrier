	<brief_summary>The purpose study see Post Amputation Pain ( PAP ) affect body brain use sensory testing ( pinprick testing ) , take picture brain ( use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) machine ) biomedical intervention ( injection pain medicine ) . All medicine fMRI machine use study FDA approve . The investigator hope learn cause PAP , investigator help future amputee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Your participation study last 5 week ask come total 3 visit . The first visit first week study , second visit second week study third ( final ) visit fifth ( final ) week study . For first visit physical examination sensory stimulation test ( vibration pinprick test ) , questionnaires health pain history , hot cold sensory test , take thermal picture body receive quick electrical stimulus . You also train use finger-span device rate pain second visit , use electronic pain diary record pain score three time day five week study . The second visit begin questionnaire first visit thermal image quick electrical stimulus . You bring fMRI scanner room Northwestern University . For hour fifteen minute take picture brain picture help u understand change brain relating pain . You put one four treatment group randomly . The study treatment get decide randomly chance , like flip coin . Injections study use local anesthetic bupivacaine ( long lasting drug like numb agent novocaine use dentist ) . This drug cause numbness , block pain nerve function near injection site 6-8 hour . Group 1 get sympathetic nerve block bupivacaine , change nerve transmit pain , either neck low back ( depend amputation locate ) , Group 2 get placebo injection ( active medicine ) either neck low back ( depend amputation locate ) , Group 3 get neuroma injection bupivacaine ( neuroma group nerve end residual limb ) , Group 4 get placebo injection ( active medicine ) neuroma . Some people get bupivacaine injection people get placebo injection compare group see bupivacaine brings , less pain relief placebo injection . We scan brain injection see brain responds pain . We also scan brain injection see brain responds differently pain injection do . You know location injection receive treatment ( neck , low back neuroma affected limb ) , know get pain medication injection placebo injection . Only study doctor know information , tell case emergency . After injection , second hour brain scanning . After scan , ask complete questionnaire , sensory test , hot cold temperature test take thermal picture body quick electrical stimulus . Your third visit four week second visit . For third visit questionnaire first second visit , sensory test , hot cold temperature test take thermal picture body quick electrical stimulus .</detailed_description>
