	<brief_title>Validation Study Healthy Female Volunteers : A Comparison Two Neurotech Vital Devices Set Provide Different Types Electrical Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Neurotech Vital Device connect series conductive hydrogel electrodes strategically position around pelvic area user . The electrode position current pathway deliver therapeutic stimulation pelvic floor muscle result repeat contraction intend muscle group . Pilot study data show novel approach produce extremely favorable adaptation improvement patient 's symptom follow intervention . In order capture intend electrode position stand-alone garment allow end user re-position electrode multiple re-applications require . The Neurotech Vital Device garment CE Marked Class IIa medical device CE Marked , part Neurotech Vital Device , line Medical Device Directive 93/42/EC amend 2007/47/EC . The Neurotech Vital Device garment clear FDA 510 ( k ) pre-market notification process USA would consider Class II device part Neurotech Vital Device . The purpose validation study establish suitability Neurotech Vital device treatment stimulation parameter markedly attenuate ( define 'modified Neurotech Vital device ' ) prior use one treatment randomise , control , double-blind study conduct patient stress urinary incontinence Germany ( Study No : BMR-11-1002 ) .</detailed_description>
