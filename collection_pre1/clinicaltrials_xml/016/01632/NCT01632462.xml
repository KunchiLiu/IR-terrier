	<brief_title>A Prospective , Placebo Controlled , Double-Blind , Cross-over Study Effects Probiotic Preparation ( VSL # 3 ) Metabolic Profile , Intestinal Permeability , Microbiota , Cytokines Chemokines Expression Other Inflammatory Markers Pediatric Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) childhood chronic relapse remit inflammatory condition significant impact growth development . IBD involve shift regulate intestinal immune response one driven unrestrained immune cell activation pro-inflammatory cytokine production . ( 1 ) The cause increase immune stimulation great interest several study indicate role commensal bacteria progression disease . ( 2 ) A recent study compare microbiota patient IBD non-IBD control reveal significant difference composition . The microbiota IBD patient show abnormal microbial composition characterize depletion Firmicutes Bacteroides , represent non-IBD control . ( 3 ) Enhanced NF-κB activity involve pathology form IBD . Crohn disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The mechanism proteasome-mediated NF-κB activation CD UC study . Visekruna et al demonstrate subunit composition proteolytic function proteasomes differ UC CD . High expression immunoproteasome subunit β1i β2i characteristic inflame mucosa CD ( 4 ) . In line , find enhanced process NF-κB precursor p105 degradation inhibitor NF-κB , IκBα , immunoproteasomes isolated mucosa CD patient . In comparison healthy control CD patient , UC patient exhibit intermediate phenotype regard proteasome-mediated processing/degradation NF-κB component ( 4 ) .Finally , increased expression NF-κB family member c-Rel inflame mucosa CD patient suggest p50/c-Rel important IFN-γ-mediated induction immunoproteasomes via IL-12-driven Th1 response . These finding suggest distinct proteasome subunit influence intensity NF-κB-mediated inflammation IBD patient ( 4 ) . In study Pagnini C et al. , author report probiotic mixture VSL # 3 prevents onset intestinal inflammation SAMP mouse model CD-ileitis . These effect associate local effect intestinal epithelium ( i.e. , stimulation TNF-α production NF-κB activation epithelial cell , couple restitution normal intestinal epithelial barrier function ) . Analysis bacterial DNA stool ileal mucosa treat mice demonstrate significant increase probiotic strain , suggest effective bacterial colonization require beneficial effect probiotic treatment . This study support hypothesis probiotic promote gut health mechanism involve stimulation epithelial innate response ( i.e. , stimulation TNF-α expression ) , rather suppression inflammation . ( 5 ) Many individual combination bacterial specie show ameliorate symptom IBD reduce intestinal inflammation animal study . Treatment mouse colitis probiotic formulation VSL # 3 increased production IL-10 percentage TGFβ-expressing T-cells . Transfer lamina propria mononuclear cell VSL # 3-treated mouse prevent colitis recipient mouse , indicate VSL # 3 initiate generation protective population cell . ( 6 ) The recent identification symbiotic bacteria potent anti-inflammatory property , correlative absence disease , suggest certain aspect human health may depend status microbiota . ( 7 ) In addition , Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) major component bacterial outer membrane largely responsible mediate septic shock . Normally body react high concentration LPS present intestinal lumen . Intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( IAP ) seem detoxify LPS hydrolyze maintain intestinal homeostasis commensal flora . ( 8 ) Probiotics modulate composition gut microbiota . Global microarray bioinformatica analysis reveal augmentation immune response , phagocytic , inflammatory pathway dominate elevation Th1 transcription factor IL10-KO mouse . IL10-KO mouse orally administer probiotic VSL # 3 exhibit site-specific downregulation inflammatory pathway include TLR signalling related effector pathways T-cell , B-cell receptor signal . More important , VSL # 3 trigger up-regulation PPAR signaling , lipid , nitrogen , amino acid , xenobiotic metabolism ( 9 ) . Actually unclear VSL # 3-induced change microbial composition affect status intestinal inflammation . It possible VSL # 3 promotes presence protective microorganism , likely constituent probiotic directly influence host innate response . It report VSL # 3 modulates barrier function , intestinal permeability , innate host function , alter , could profound impact state colitis . VSL # 3 show enhance barrier function decrease epithelial permeability IL10_/_ mouse , correlate reduction intestinal inflammation . Another recent study demonstrate VSL # 3 prevents development ileitis SAMP1/YitFc mouse enhance epithelial barrier function activate innate signal lead NF-jB activation . These effect appear mediate VSL # 3 secreted product . This consistent report show probiotic-derived factor capable modulate host response experimental colitis . Additionally , structural component present probiotic bacteria could profoundly impact immune response favor production immunosuppressive molecule IL-10 ( 10 ) . Purpose : The purpose study evaluate effect probiotic formulation , VSL # 3 , versus placebo , metabolic profile , intestinal permeability , microbiota , cytokine chemokines expression inflammatory marker pediatric patient Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) remission ( 11 ) . Secondary objective : - To determine effect Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index ( PCDAI ) - determine time till flare CD pediatric patient VSL # 3 compare placebo - ass whether concurrent therapy VSL # 3 reduces severity flare occur - ass safety tolerability therapy VSL # 3 high dosage pediatric patient CD Study design This investigation randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial . The study include 30 child CD articulate 6 month follow . A group 10 volunteer healthy child , comparable age sex , use reference group analysis metabolic profile.. These child randomise treatment group receive 2 month either 1-2 packet contain 900 billion bacteria/day VSL # 3 accord weight , group receive placebo drug . Assignment therapy placebo determine accord computer-generated randomization scheme . The medication dispense investigator visit ; compliance assess counting return bag question patient . Excellent compliance define violation protocol respect intake study medication . At completion 8 week , `` wash-out '' period 6 week do , preparation administer . Then patient switch group follow likewise 8 week . All patient continue regular medication throughout study period ( azathioprine associate 5-ASA ) .
