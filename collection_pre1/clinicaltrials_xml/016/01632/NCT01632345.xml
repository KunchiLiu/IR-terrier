	<brief_summary>Part 1 - Dose-Ranging . Part 1 evaluate ( 1 ) safety tolerability ( 2 ) efficacy ( antiretroviral activity ) 4 dos doravirine ( MK-1439 ) compare efavirenz , give combination TRUVADA® least 24 week approximately 200 participant . A single dose doravirine select study participant complete Week 24 visit Part 1 . Participants receive dose doravirine Part 1 switch select doravirine dose continue study 96 week . Part 2 - Selected Dose . Part 2 initiated doravirine dose select indicated Part 1 . Approximately 120 additional participant randomize 1:1 ratio select dose doravirine efavirenz , combination TRUVADA® 96 week blind treatment . Part 2 evaluate safety select dose compare efavirenz , particularly regard central nervous system adverse event ( CNS event ) . The hypothesis test study MK-1439 final dose select superior efavirenz , give combination TRUVADA® , measure proportion participant CNS event Week 8 . If superiority establish Week 8 , hypothesis test Week 24 .</brief_summary>
