	<brief_summary>Early-stage colorectal cancer ( CRC ) localize resectable , 20 % patient metastatic disease time diagnosis 50 % patient eventually die disease . The frequent site colorectal metastasis liver , account 30 % 60 % case . In patient , extent liver disease main determinant survival . Hepatectomy potentially curative therapy colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) , traditional criterion resectability use , 10 % patient candidate surgical resection . Although adjuvant systemic therapy resection primary colorectal tumor well establish , relatively data use postoperative therapy vs. surgery alone patient undergone resection liver metastasis . In trial , absolute increase 3-year PFS rate addition FOLFOX4 modest significant 9 % patient resection ( 33 % 42 % ; P = .025 ) . For improve survival patient CLM , several study biologic agent try . The use bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , result increase response rate patient stage IV colorectal cancer improve OS PFS . In ongoing phase II trial present ASCO 2008 , patient potentially curable resection liver metastasis , perioperative treatment capecitabine oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) plus bevacizumab yield overall response rate 73 % stable disease 21 % mean PFS 27 month . Response chemotherapy significantly correlate prolonged PFS ( P &lt; .001 ) . On basis background , design phase II study compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy perioperative postoperative bevacizumab treatment patient CLM .</brief_summary>
