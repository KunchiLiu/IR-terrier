	<brief_summary>Obesity strongly associate risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Data increasingly suggest visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) accumulation -- increase abdominal fat -- particularly deleterious cardiovascular health , study need test idea . Increased abdominal fat may also associate low secretion hormone call growth hormone ( GH ) , help body burn fat . The current study aim carefully characterize relationship abdominal fat CVD . In addition , use medication call growth hormone release hormone , strategy reduce abdominal fat , investigator test hypothesis abdominal fat contributes uniquely increase arterial inflammation . In first part study , investigator investigate lean ( healthy weight ) individual individual increase abdominal fat . The investigator study body composition , cardiovascular risk measure , insulin sensitivity , growth hormone dynamic , hypothesis abdominal fat , independent general obesity , strongly associate arterial wall thicken atherosclerotic inflammation . The investigator assess arterial wall thickness , plaque morphology , atherosclerotic inflammation , investigator determine association variable regional fat accumulation , particular attention abdominal fat . The second , treatment part study individual increase abdominal fat find low growth hormone secretion . In part study , investigator test effect growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) analogue reduce abdominal fat , consequently , reduce arterial inflammation . The investigator hypothesize abdominal fat reduction , independent change growth hormone , reduce arterial inflammation arterial wall thickness .</brief_summary>
