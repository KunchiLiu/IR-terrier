	<detailed_description>Obesity acknowledge one big public health challenge today year come , particularly due rise prevalence child adolescent . In addition physical , mental social health consequence obesity epidemic , major concern emanates overweight obesity related economic burden . Here , investigator invexamine impact extreme obesity ( BMI ≥35kg/m2 ) healthcare utilization , cost , health relate quality life cohort adolescent . Adolescents moderate obesity ( BMI 30-34.9kg/m2 ) serve control group . The study subproject `` Medical psychosocial implication adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance effect structure care '' , short : `` Youth Extreme obesity Study ( YES ) '' , comprise recruitment characterization obese ( BMI 30-34.9kg/m2 ) extremely obese ( BMI ≥35kg/m2 ) youth different healthcare- non healthcare setting , randomize control trial investigate novel intervention target improve quality life social function extremely obese adolescent , structure prospective evaluation adolescent bariatric surgery , long-term prospective observation study . Based current state knowledge , investigator formulate follow hypothesis regard healthcare utilization , cost , health relate quality life : 1 . Cost induced utilization healthcare service adolescent extreme obesity ( BMI ≥ 35kg/m2 ) significantly high compare cost induced adolescent obese ( BMI 30-34.9kg/m2 ) . In adolescent undergo bariatric surgery , cost decrease intervention . 2 . Adolescents extreme obesity ( BMI ≥ 35 ) significantly low health relate quality life compare adolescent obesity ( BMI 30-34.9kg/m2 ) . After specific intervention ( psycho-social intervention subproject 2 , bariatric surgery subproject 3 ) , health relate quality life increase intervention . 3 . The cost surgical intervention accompany strong positive effect ( relative weight loss health relate quality life ) Therefore bariatric surgery cost-effective . 4 .

A total 600 adolescent age 14 24.9 year ( initially 21 year ) extreme obesity ( BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 ) 600 adolescent obesity ( BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2 ) recruit 24 month period . The five participate university center distribute across 4 geographic region North ( Berlin ) , West ( Essen/Datteln ) , East ( Leipzig ) South ( Ulm ) Germany , therefore render data representative Germany whole . Utilization healthcare cost associate extreme obesity adolescent assess via standardized patient questionnaire . Health related quality life associate extreme obesity adolescent assess validated instrument baseline every 12 month ( initially every 6 month ) . Cost-effectiveness cost-utility analysis perform . The investigator expect provide valid up-to-date information healthcare cost health-related quality life relevant patient group . This information inform planning future preventive therapeutic strategy . In February 2013 , amendment add study include patient till 24.9 year . In addition , amendment December 2014 , number visit reduce biannually annually travel-imbursement 30€ patient implement .</detailed_description>
