	<detailed_description>This study develop implement mobile technology-delivered psychosocial intervention opioid-dependent adult methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) . This novel therapeutic system promise cost-effective enable provision flexible , on-demand therapeutic support outside formal treatment set . The specific aim investigation follow : Aim 1 : The investigator develop novel , interactive , evidence-based psychosocial intervention deliver via mobile phone , design promote skills acquisition reduce illicit drug use . Specifically , Mobile Therapeutic System ( MTS ) offer key element psychosocial intervention substance use disorder know efficacy ( Community Reinforcement Approach ) . Participants provide unlimited daily prompt encourage use program able access application time much choose , within natural environment . Our iterative development process include input focus group client methadone treatment ( n=24 ) , input expert field , feedback test beta-version mobile phone-based program client methadone treatment ( n=30 ) . Aim 2 : The investigator evaluate efficacy mobile tool participant enter MMT first three month treatment ( n=219 ) . The investigator evaluate relative preliminary efficacy ( 1 ) standard treatment , ( 2 ) standard treatment plus MTS ( 3 ) mobile-based control condition primary outcome retention opioid use ( via urine toxicology ) secondary outcome substance use ( via urine toxicology self-report ) , readiness change drug use behavior , cop skill , opioid craving , HIV risk behavior , psychosocial function 3-month intervention phase . Durability effect examine 1 3 month follow-up . Aim 3 : The investigator perform economic analysis MTS community-based MMT . The investigator estimate incremental cost incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) MTS relative standard care mobile control group . The primary ICER incremental cost per increase abstinence time ( clinical measure effectiveness ) secondary ICER incremental cost per increase quality adjust life year ( QALY ) ( economic measure effectiveness ) . Cost data vital future translational project disseminate effective mobile intervention community system . If result promise , novel therapeutic tool may tremendous impact improve access effectiveness substance abuse treatment variety population ( could also adapt array behavioral health application ) , significantly limit cost .</detailed_description>
