	<brief_summary>The aim study develop non-invasive MRI , MRS approach quantify plaque composition lipid content plaque potential repeat vivo measurement . To investigate sensitivity specificity 3.0 Tesla MRI MRS dimension composition assessment carotid artery plaque , particularly plaque lipid rich necrotic core . This non-invasive cross-sectional study , compare carotid parameter in-vivo 3.0 Tesla MRI , MRS B-mode ultrasound histology specimen collect endarterectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigate Sensitivity Specificity 3.0 Tesla MRI Carotid Artery Plaque</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis protract fact lifelong progressive disease . Over time , lipid accumulate artery wall form fatty streak , eventually develop atherosclerotic plaque ( 1 ) . The late stage process , quiescent atherosclerotic plaque active plaque , high risk trigger acute vascular event , myocardial infarction stroke ( 1 ) . Much effort put development novel drug aim prevent cardiovascular disease . Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) lower drug , particularly statin , play pivotal role . The hypothesis serum lipid lower result decrease lipid accumulation arterial wall thus atherogenesis , form basis successful drug develop strategy ( 1 ; 2 ) . To draw valid conclusion determinant disease effectiveness lipid modify therapeutic intervention , image atherosclerosis use validated tool ass efficacy novel compound ( 3 ; 4 ) . Although image arterial wall dimension B-mode ultrasound intra-vascular ultrasound proven value , longitudinal data effect cardiovascular drug arterial wall plaque composition , particular vulnerable plaque lipid rich necrotic core ( LRNC ) , scarce . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) non-invasive imaging modality potentially image plaque composition in-vivo human carotid artery . MRI image acquisition various weighting enable visualisation plaque composition . Calcification , haemorrhage , fibrous cap lipid rich necrotic core readily distinguish , provide information plaque vulnerability . MRS give spectrum resonance , afford detection specific chemical component inherent frequency shift relative water ( 5 ) . In image guide MRS , MR image utilized image localize plaque . Proton spectrum collect plaque , specific proton resonance lipid component mobile state , include cholesterol ester ( CE ) , identify ( 6 ) .</detailed_description>
