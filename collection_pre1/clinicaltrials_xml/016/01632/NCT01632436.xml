	<detailed_description>This study conduct patient metastatic cancer either moderate , severe hepatic impairment fail antineoplastic therapy standard therapy . The study conduct two stage . Stage I include patient moderate hepatic impairment Stage II include patient severe hepatic impairment . An analysis data Stage I portion study perform decide whether enroll patient Stage II portion study . Patients hepatic impairment ( either moderate severe ) pair match control patient normal hepatic function , match gender , age , body surface ( BSA ) . Patients receive single dose pixantrone day 1 21 day cycle . Blood sample obtain various time point first week first cycle pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis . If patient hepatic impairment develop dose limit toxicity , subsequent patient administer low dose pixantrone . If patient hepatic impairment receive reduce dose pixantrone experience dose limit toxicity , study terminate . Patients demonstrate clinical , radiologic , evidence response stabilization initial dose pixantrone wish continue treatment may discretion Investigator . Patients receive additional cycle treat pixantrone every 21 day 5 additional cycle follow safety , 30 day last dose .</detailed_description>
