	<brief_title>Evaluating Intervention Responsiveness People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disorder damage myelin sheaths axon brain spinal cord . Within ten year diagnose MS , majority people experience disability , often walk impairment . The currently available pharmacologic treatment offer protection new attack help recovery ; thus , many case hope improvement , physical rehabilitation . Rehabilitative intervention , progressive resistance training ( PRT ) , show improve strength sometimes walk many individual MS . However , also many individual respond , tend ignored literature . In addition , intervention study measure primary impairment ( e.g , strength ) little consideration impairment ( e.g. , sensory loss ) effect complicate movement ( e.g . standing , change direction ) . Since MS heterogeneous , would helpful know individual likely benefit rehabilitation . Standard MS care use MRI diagnosis , identification inflammatory lesion , determination treatment efficacy . Conventional rehabilitation relies clinical judgment , rating scale impairment measure determine treatment efficacy . The investigator would like understand behavioral impairment MRI finding relate , predict rehabilitation potential people MS . The investigator previously show damage measure use tract specific MRI , specifically magnetization transfer ( MTI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , correlate physical impairment individual MS . Here investigator propose determine whether measure clinical impairment tract specific MRI improve ability predict respond best PRT exercise intervention improve functional movement . The investigator perform PRT intervention . The investigator measure sensory motor impairment walk ability intervention . MRI do treatment ass integrity critical motor ( corticospinal , CST ) sensory ( dorsal column-medial lemniscus , DC-ML ) tracts across cervical spinal cord brain . The investigator hypothesize combination impairment measure MRI measure predict improvement functional movement follow three month PRT .</detailed_description>
