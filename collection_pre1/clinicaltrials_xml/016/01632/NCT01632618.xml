	<brief_summary>Low back pain ( LBP ) frequently report musculoskeletal problem third frequently report symptom kind people age 75 . In fact , 17.3 % visit physician LBP involve individual 65 . In old adult , LBP associate host negative consequence , include decreased physical function , increase fall risk , increase mood disturbance increase health care utilization . Surprisingly , little research focus LBP people 65 . But , recent evidence demonstrate LBP associate increase intramuscular fat infiltration abdominal paraspinal muscle alter muscle composition increase risk mobility-related functional decline old adult . While trunk muscle training ( TMT ) use young LBP group , unproven elder , alone may sufficient substantially improve function symptom , give compromise state age muscle . TMT augment neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) know improve strength function beyond capacity volitional exercise alone , may provide great improvement . Treatment chronic LBP older adult use exercise intervention hypothesize way prevent functional decline frailty progression ; however hypothesis yet experimentally confirm . In exploratory study , investigator test hypothesis TMT plus NMES result reduce disability pain severity compare usual care elder chronic LBP .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>64 participant &gt; age 65 recruited participate . Participants include meet follow criterion : Low Back Pain least 3 month pain least moderate intensity every day almost every day require activity modification . This criterion necessary guarantee subject population chronic pain control conventional therapy . At least moderate pain intensity ( &gt; 3 scale 010 ) require ensure ability detect treatment effect , pain moderate intensity show significant pain literature.11 The Pain thermometer show reliable old adults12 , 13 , use screen pain intensity . Subjects exclude study follow exist : Prominent component radicular pain : CLBP distal radiation knee Known spinal pathology osteoarthritis : ( e.g. , history back surgery recent trauma , spinal stenosis , vertebral compression fracture , ankylose spondylitis , carcinoma metastatic spine ) In case , LBP may nonmechanical origin . Nonambulatory , severely impaired mobility ( i.e. , require use walker ) : Since measurement physical performance propose study include gait velocity stand balance , condition LBP could negatively impact measure may confound study result . Folstein MiniMental State Examination score &lt; 24 exclude subject uncertain reliability answer selfreported outcome measure . Severe visual hearing impairment : Since study involve questionnaire telephone evaluation , severe visual and/or hear impairment may interfere data collection . Red flags indicative serious disorder underlie LBP : Red flag would require specialized medical attention include fever , significant unintentional weight loss , sudden recent change character intensity pain , trauma precede onset pain , sign symptom caudae equinae . These subject promptly refer primary practitioner . Significant pain part body back acute LBP : Since specifically evaluate chronic LBP , want confound outcome data pain area acute pain . Thus subject LBP severity great pain severity elsewhere body include . Acute terminal illness : To insure weekly participation six month followup , subject acute terminal illness exclude study . Presence pacemaker : Since electrical stimulation use study effect stimulation pacemaker unknown , cautious exclude subject device .</criteria>
