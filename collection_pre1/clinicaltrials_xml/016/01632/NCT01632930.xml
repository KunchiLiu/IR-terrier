	<brief_summary>The ultrasound-guided biopsy prostate validate technique diagnosis prostate cancer , first human cancer second lead cause cancer death . Overall , half case , prostate biopsy perform search prostate cancer negative . In population , consensus recommendation care , lead repeat invasive biopsy , potential source complication . The PCA3 urine test ( ProgensaTM , GenProbe ) innovative diagnostic tool predict positivity prostate biopsy , especially patient least one negative biopsy . Proposed clinical practice France commercial kit , expensive cover health insurance . It therefore essential ass medical economic impact introduction medical practice . The investigator propose set study high standard proof , multicenter , base recruitment patient treated hospital . This work hypothesis availability PCA3 test result would reduce number invasive biopsy perform incorrectly patient already least one negative biopsy , thus improve diagnostic strategy prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
