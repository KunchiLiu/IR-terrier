	<brief_summary>- Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy lymph node dissection minimally invasive surgery gain popularity treatment early gastric cancer East Asian country , even though long-term follow-up outcome base multicenter randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) still await . - For patient locally advanced gastric cancer , several study indicate laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy D2 lymphadenectomy technically feasible safe procedure experience surgeon high-volume specialized hospital . However , application controversial mainly due lack solid evidence oncologic efficacy . Therefore , conventional open approach still current standard advance gastric cancer . - Nowadays , proportion patient locally advanced gastric cancer estimate 80 per cent gastric cancer case China . Before clinical application laparoscopic procedure treatment curative intent advance gastric cancer locate middle- lower-third stomach , oncologic efficacy must verify . - Accordingly , comparison intraoperative postoperative complication laparoscopic open distal subtotal gastrectomy 65 year old patient gastric cancer base randomize control trial need .</brief_summary>
