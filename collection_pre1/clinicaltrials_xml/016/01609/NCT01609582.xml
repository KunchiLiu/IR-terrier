	<brief_title>Study TAK-875 Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-875 . TAK-875 test treat people diabetes . This study look number cardiovascular event ( example , heart attack ) people take TAK-875 comparison placebo addition standard care . The study enroll approximately 5000 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - TAK-875 50 mg. - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient . All participant ask take one tablet time day throughout study . All participant ask record time low blood sugar symptom diary . This multi-centre trial conduct worldwide , approximately 700 site . The overall time participate study 6 year . Participants make approximately 24 visit clinic , telephone visit conduct alternate 6 month schedule start Month 27 . Due potential concern liver safety , balance , benefit treat patient fasiglifam ( TAK-875 ) outweigh potential risk . For reason , Takeda decide voluntarily terminate development activity fasiglifam .</detailed_description>
