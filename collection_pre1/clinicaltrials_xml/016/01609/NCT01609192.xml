	<brief_summary>The project 's background : Sickle cell disease , present France , frequent genetic illness . Recent progress treatment , particular use hydroxyurea , considerably modify prognosis disease . Many patient reach reproductive age consider father . Exceptional study report potential impact medical treatment sperm parameter fertility male patient . In retrospective analysis , investigator find observed alteration semen parameter due sickle cell disease seem exacerbate hydroxyurea treatment . The study hypothesis : A large prospective study essential ass potential adverse impact medical treatment sickle cell disease spermatogenesis consider advisability propose sperm cryopreservation treatment start . Primary purpose protocol : evaluate impact treatment hydroxyurea ( 20-30 mg/kg/day ) , 6 month begin , 34 men sickle cell disease ( 18-60 year old ) . The main trial criterion average difference concentration spermatozoon ( millions/ml ) ejaculate , 6 month medical treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study Sickle cell disease , present France , frequent genetic illness . Recent progress treatment , particular use hydroxyurea , considerably modify prognosis disease . Many patient reach reproductive age consider father . Exceptional study report potential impact medical treatment sperm parameter fertility male patient . In retrospective analysis , investigator find observed alteration semen parameter due sickle cell disease seem exacerbate hydroxyurea treatment . Moreover , hydroxyurea cessation , global result 30 patient statistically different hydroxyurea treatment , four individual follow-up sperm parameter seem recover quickly total number spermatozoon per ejaculate fell normal range half case . Therefore , large prospective study essential ass potential adverse impact medical treatment sickle cell disease spermatogenesis consider advisability propose sperm cryopreservation treatment start . Main outcomes Evaluate impact treatment hydroxyurea ( 20-30 mg/kg/day ) , 6 month begin , 34 men sickle cell disease ( 18-60 year old ) . The primary outcome average difference concentration spermatozoon ( millions/ml ) ejaculate , 6 month medical treatment . Six month represent 2 complete cycle spermatogenesis . The secondary outcome sperm parameter : vitality , mobility , motility , morphology spermatozoa assessment sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation TUNEL assay ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling ) . This prospective , multicenter , cohort study allow evaluate impact treatment hydroxyurea spermatogenesis men sickle cell anemia . With hypothesis five time reduction spermatozoon concentration ( 38 million ± 43 treatment ) , least 34 analyzable patient require ( age 18 60 year old ) never receive compound know toxic spermatogenesis . Protocol Drepanocytic men eligible first treatment hydroxyurea send CECOS ( center study cryopreservation oocytes spermatozoon ) Tenon , Cochin Jean Verdier hospital . Their medical history record sperm parameter analyze accord WHO criterion . Part ejaculate fix store ( - 20°C ) DNA fragmentation assay . The rest semen could cryopreserved , accord patient ' , case potential deleterious effect medical treatment male fertility . Six month begin treatment hydroxyurea , another sperm recovery require analysis already describe parameter evaluate compare initial result . Prospects The study bring valuable data effect hydroxyurea human spermatogenesis . If significant impairment observe , would recommend perform sperm cryopreservation treatment 's start . The study could also help distinguish detrimental effect due acute adverse event sickle cell disease link administration hydroxyurea .</detailed_description>
