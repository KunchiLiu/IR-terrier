	<brief_summary>The concurrent use chemotherapy radiation therapy ( CCRT ) important treatment stratagem locally advanced head neck cancer nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) . For case , 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) cisplatin ( CDDP ) commonly use agent CCRT . It play important role improve treatment outcome increase opportunity organ preservation . In past , Radiotherapy ( RT ) solely used local treatment effect estimate local effect model . However , grow evidence show irradiation direct DNA damage-dependent effect well send signal neighbor cell . Recently , investigator report abdominal irradiation could significantly modulate systemic pharmacokinetics 5-FU 0.5 Gy , off-target area clinical practice , 2 Gy , daily treatment dose target treatment experimental rat model . Additionally , result clinical investigation show colorectal cancer patient low AUC 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy lower disease-free survival . Taken together , line evidence support importance necessity search mediator responsible unexpected effect local RT systemic pharmacokinetics chemotherapeutic agent , 5-FU . In present study , investigator examine whether phenomena mechanism RT-PK ( pharmacokinetics ) fact different anticancer drug different part human .</brief_summary>
