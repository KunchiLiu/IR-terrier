	<brief_summary>Biomarkers Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) occupy essential place recently formulate diagnostic criterion AD role identify pathophysiological process underlie cognitive impairment predict time dementia . Three biomarkers brain imaging test ( amyloid PET , fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET , structural MRI ) . In order effectively use AD biomarkers diagnostic prognostic purpose , continuous value much divide normal abnormal range . This require cut point ( ) establish continuous distribution value biomarker . The investigator objective proposal obtain imaging biomarker data group individual appropriate establish normative value AD biomarkers . The investigator believe valid approach establish biomarker cut point base upper bound range observe young early-middle-age subject presence occult AD pathology extremely unlikely . Based large volume community-based autopsy data , upper age limit would 50 year old . The low age bound group subject use establish normative AD biomarker value would base consideration brain maturation , may continue middle- late-20s . Thus , take consideration , ideal age range establish normative AD imaging biomarker data ( amyloid PET , FDG PET , structural MRI ) may age 30-49 year old .</brief_summary>
