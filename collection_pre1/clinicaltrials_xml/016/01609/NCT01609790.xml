	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial safety run-in component study side effect well bevacizumab give without trebananib work treat patient brain tumor . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Trebananib may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give bevacizumab together trebananib effective bevacizumab alone treat brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Trebananib Treating Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability AMG 386 ( trebananib ) 15 mg/kg weekly combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( Cohort 1 ) . ( close accrual 10/2/12 ) II . To assess efficacy AMG 386 combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week compare bevacizumab monotherapy bevacizumab-naïve patient , measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) ( Cohort 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity profile ( Cohorts 1 2 ) . II . To assess feasibility AMG 386 15 mg/kg weekly combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week ( Cohort 1 [ close accrual 10/2/12 ] ) , measure percentage patient require dose reduction/interruption discontinuation first 2 subsequent cycle . III . To determine radiographic response rate ( RR ) , median progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) bevacizumab-naïve patient ( Cohort 2 ) . IV . To assess efficacy AMG 386 15 mg/kg weekly combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week patient progress bevacizumab , measure overall survival ( OS ) ( cross-over placebo arm Cohort 2 ) . V. To correlate outcome treatment tumor genotype , expression profile , circulate angiogenesis biomarkers tumor specimen ( Cohort 2 ) . VI . To determine RR , PFS6 , PFS patient progress bevacizumab therapy receive AMG 386 combination bevacizumab ( cross-over placebo arm Cohort 2 ) . VII . To determine serum pharmacokinetics AMG 386 patient receive bevacizumab ( Cohort 1 cross-over placebo arm Cohort 2 ) . OUTLINE : This safety study ( cohort 1 [ close accrual 10/2/12 ] ) follow randomize study ( cohort 2 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
