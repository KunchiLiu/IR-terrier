	<brief_summary>This Phase I , dose escalation study healthy adolescent child ( 6-17 year ) evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prime-boost regimen 2012/2013 seasonal influenza DNA vaccine ( HA DNA ) follow licensed 2012/2013 TIV vaccine . The comparator group receive license 2012/2013 TIV prime boost . The hypothesis 2012/2013 HA DNA prime-TIV boost regimen safe result broader durable immune response observe age-matched comparator TIV-TIV group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seasonal Influenza DNA Vaccine &amp; Seasonal Influenza Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine ( TIV ) Children &amp; Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccines effective way prevent influenza infection . Each year World Health Organization ( WHO ) U.S FDA recommend influenza strain include seasonal influenza vaccine . The licensed seasonal influenza vaccine direct 3 influenza virus strain : influenza A H1N1 , influenza A H3N2 , influenza B . The currently approve vaccine depend upon labor-intensive method limit manufacture speed capacity . Influenza vaccine rapidly produce induce stronger , broad persistent immune response recognize public health need . In protocol evaluate investigational seasonal influenza ( HA DNA ) vaccine healthy adolescent child ( 6-17 year ) . Some participant receive HA DNA vaccine `` prime '' follow licensed trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) `` boost '' 18 week later . Other participant receive two TIV injection 18 week apart . The result compare . The HA DNA vaccine TIV direct 3 influenza strain select 2012/2013 vaccine . Prior study adults avian seasonal influenza DNA vaccine complete . The DNA vaccination assess safe well tolerate adult . The immune response avian influenza augment DNA vaccine prim compare two vaccination inactivate avian influenza ( H5N1 ) vaccine prime-boost interval 12-24 week , prime-boost interval 4 week .</detailed_description>
