	<brief_summary>Verruca vulgaris ( VV ) , common wart , relatively prevalent often frustrate cutaneous disease treat . A single , highly effective therapy treatment VV find . Liquid nitrogen consider standard care VV study report 44 % 47 % cure rate . In search efficacious convenient therapeutic option , variety laser report treatment VV include Nd : YAG laser ( 1064nm ) . Lasers offer potential decreased treatment associate pain , few office visit , high cure rate low recurrence rate . However , many available publish study draw conclusion case report small case series without randomize controlled trial . A randomized , control study need evaluate efficacy microsecond Nd : YAG ( 1064nm ) compare conventional cryotherapy . This study use Cutera CoolGlide Nd : YAG laser operate infrared spectrum wavelength 1064nm . This single site , double blind , randomize control clinical trial evaluate efficacy Nd : YAG laser ( Cutera ) treatment verruca vulgaris hand foot versus conventional liquid nitrogen therapy . The investigator hypothesize significantly high number wart complete resolution 4 month follow-up Nd : YAG treat group versus liquid nitrogen therapy group . The investigator also hypothesize fast time complete resolution verruca Nd : YAG treat group versus liquid nitrogen treat group .</brief_summary>

A secondary outcome include : time complete resolution lesion . 2 . Objectives Specific Aims 1.1 . Primary objective : To evaluate efficacy Cutera CoolGlide 1064nm Nd : YAG laser treatment verruca vulgaris hand foot versus conventional therapy liquid nitrogen cryotherapy . 2 . Research Design Methods This single site double blind ( faculty observer patient blind ; operator/clinician non-blinded ) , randomize control clinical trial evaluate efficacy Nd : YAG laser ( Cutera ) treatment verruca vulgaris hand foot versus conventional therapy liquid nitrogen 52 patient . 2.2 Study Procedures Informed consent A sign informed consent form obtain patient prior enter study Physical examination A brief physical examination skin include affected area perform . Photographs take affected area , prior treatment baseline fifth treatment follow-up . The investigator document number , size location lesion . Laboratory test No laboratory test perform research project . Procedure Visit Initial Visit ( DAY 1 ) : Prior clinic visit treatment : 1 . The patient screen inclusion study team member use screen questionnaire ( Appendix A ) . 2 . A sub-investigator review screen criterion validate patient meet eligibility criterion . 3 . Written inform consent obtain patient participation study ( Appendix B ) . Treatment 1 : 1 . The qualify eligible patient consent participate study assign receive either Nd : YAG laser treatment liquid nitrogen therapy use previously establish block randomization schema prepare research statistician . 2 . All lesion evaluate pared # 15 surgical blade thickness , callous , crust debris note , hyperkeratosis skin thicken evident would impede evaluation wart . 3 . The attend faculty physician confirm diagnosis use dermatoscope blind treatment assignment . 4 . Photos take lesion , par # 15 blade remove crust thicken skin wart , prior treatment , treatment . A consistent photography procedure ( Appendix C ) use . Each wart number ; size location document Dermatology Study Wart Assessment Treatment Records ( Appendix D ) . Photographs take treatment . 5 . All lesion anesthetize topical lidocaine ( LMX 4 % ) apply occlusion 15minutes prior treatment . 6 . All patient prepare treatment manner . They wear protective goggles use laser treatment use head phone muffle sound treatment . Both treatment modality turn prior treatment sound may predictive treatment . 8 . The patient randomly select receive Nd : YAG laser treatment fully treat follow parameter laser . If wart great 3mm follow setting use : 20 millisecond pulse width , fluence 180 J/cm2 , spot size 5 mm . If wart 3mm less diameter , laser setting : 180 J/cm2 , spot size 3mm , pulse width 15 millisecond . No laser gel use treatment . After laser pulse , treat area briefly cool tip laser . If one pulse need cover entire area wart , 10 % overlap use area outside wart border treat . 9 . The patient randomly select receive liquid nitrogen treatment receive liquid nitrogen spray gun 5-7 second create maintain 1-2 mm freeze halo around lesion duration application . Use nozzle extender wart less 3 mm . 10 . Patients instructed avoid treat wart home , may use vaseline , aquaphor , plain petrolatum band aid need comfort next visit . 11 . Patients schedule return visit two week assessment effect treatment . 12 . Patient treatment document appropriate Dermatology Study Wart Treatment Record ( Appendix D ) . Revision Dermatology Study Wart Treatment Record attach Request Revision . 12.1 Document patient 's medication Master Medication Record 12.2 Document patient 's wart Master Record Warts 1 . Treatments # 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ( DAY 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 ; +/- 7 day ) Patient return 2week interval evaluation documentation lesion . 2 . An objective faculty observer blind treatment , evaluate wart persistence clearance treatment # 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , lesion par . Faculty document finding Wart Study Attending Faculty Observer Assessment Tool Appendix E ) . 3 . Photos take par lesion # 15 blade ; number , size , location lesion document , well occurrence new wart . 1 . If patient clinical lesion present determine blind faculty clinician , patient move follow phase , see . 2 . If still clinical evidence persist lesion patient retreat randomized modality treatment # 1 . 3 . If new wart identify , investigator document number , size , location wart , photograph new wart treatment . 4 . Treatment new wart randomize treatment modality avoid patient un-blinding . 4 . All lesion anesthetize topical lidocaine ( LMX 4 % ) apply occlusion 15 minute prior treatment . 5 . All patient prepare treatment manner . They wear protective goggles use laser treatment use head phone muffle sound treatment . Both treatment modality turn prior treatment sound may predictive treatment . 6 . Proceed treatment wart manner randomization . Complete step 9- 11 listed initial treatment . Follow-Up Phase : Clinical Clearance Once lesion clinically clear , patient move follow phase . No lesion treat 5 time . Patients clear evaluation 5th treatment consider treatment failure remove study . Patients fail study treatment offer continue treatment outside study Dermatology Clinic . The patient responsible standard charge additional treatment Dermatology Clinic . Patients clear return clinic evaluation 1 2 month clinical clearance determine continue clearance recurrence . Recurrence define new clinical evident lesion appear location ( ) previously treat wart ( ) 2 month post treatment . 1 2 Month Follow Up 1 . Clinician perform examination treat area previous visit . 2 . Photos take . 3 . Size location new lesion , , document . 4 . Recurrence previously treat lesion document . 4 Month Follow-up At 4 month follow clearance date , structure telephone interview investigate status lesion ( ) . If patient unsure status clearance , patient ask return evaluation sub-investigator . If wart recurs persists , patient offer additional treatment use option bill post-study treatment . 3 . Data management statistical analysis Data Collection management Data collect paper Case Report form resident physician treating subject . See data collection tool ( Appendix D ) rule Procedure Book . Double data entry provide data entry staff two separate excel spread sheet . Data comparison complete research statistician . Any discrepancy review study team . Issues need adjudication decide PI . Sample size determination : Sample size calculate base formula effective sample size randomize clustered design binary outcome . On average , patient present approximately three lesion ( usually 1 5 ) require treatment . An estimate 50 % cure rate , use cryotherapy plantar wart , draw Cochrane review publish 2006 [ 10 , 11 ] . We consider clinically significant improvement , least 80 % wart treat Nd : Yag laser completely resolve 6 month visit . We assume moderate intra-cluster correlation coefficient 0.3 . Given cluster design , enrol 52 patient , average , 3 wart , randomize one two treatment , need provide 84 % power show statistically significant difference cure rate . Significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Data Management Analysis All analyse do use SASÂ® 9.2 . Demographic clinical variable summarize use mean , median percentage , appropriate . To determine whether primary outcome , complete resolution lesion 2 4 month follow-up , different treatment group , use generalize linear mixed model binomial distribution , initial lesion size duration , covariates model . The correlation outcomes within patient model use random effect . The secondary outcome , time complete resolution analyze use use multilevel survival model patient random effect initial lesion size duration covariates model . To see whether result sensitive miss data , model analyze without self-reported 4-month outcome .</detailed_description>
