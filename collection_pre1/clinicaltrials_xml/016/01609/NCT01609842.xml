	<brief_summary>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) common invasive cardiovascular procedure perform VA 13,000 procedure FY10 . Clopidogrel critical adjuvant therapy follow PCI stent placement generally recommend 1 year follow procedure . Despite evidence support clopidogrel use , study outside within VA suggest poor adherence clopidogrel common . However , prior intervention target non-adherence specifically focus clopidogrel adherence among PCI patient . There many potential reason early clopidogrel discontinuation involve patient healthcare system factor . Patients report follow reason discontinue clopidogrel within 1 month drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation : 1 ) misunderstanding intend treatment duration ; 2 ) conflict recommendation intend duration ; 3 ) cost medication ; 4 ) patient ' decision stop . In contrast , patient continue take clopidogrel report follow helpful : 1 ) communication letter physician ; 2 ) receive specific instruction clopidogrel use . These finding suggest specific intervention implement improve clopidogrel adherence . Multi-modal intervention incorporate frequent follow-up , especially pharmacists use interactive voice response ( IVR ) technology improve medication adherence . IVR technology computer-based telephone system initiate call , receive call , provide information , collect data user . IVR currently mainstay VA patient frequently interact automate system get clinic appointment and/or refill prescription . IVR part multi-modal intervention well receive patient , increase adherence medication ( e.g. , statin ) , improved clinical outcome ( e.g. , blood pressure , diabetes symptom , health status ) . In addition , investigator successfully use IVR part multi-modal , multi-site intervention include pharmacist improve blood pressure level among hypertensive patient . Accordingly , investigator design intervention improve clopidogrel adherence build investigator ' prior work successful adherence intervention literature . The investigator propose hybrid effectiveness-implementation study multi-faceted intervention improve clopidogrel adherence VA PCI center . The investigator use VA 's Cardiovascular Assessment Reporting Tracking ( CART-CL ) , uniform cath lab procedure report tool VA cath lab . The intervention consist 4 component : ) alert CART-CL send inpatient pharmacist prior discharge patient receive stent ; b ) pharmacist bring clopidogrel patient 's bedside prior hospital discharge well educate patient importance adherence clopidogrel follow PCI ; c ) interactive voice response ( IVR ) call make patient prior time clopidogrel refill remind patient facilitate refill follow-up ; ) Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) member contact patient delay fill clopidogrel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Study Improve Clopidogrel Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Hypotheses Specific Aims The main objective conduct type 1 hybrid effectiveness/implementation study test effectiveness successfully-piloted , evidence-based , multi-faceted intervention improve patient adherence clopidogrel follow PCI . The propose study test hypothesis successfully-piloted , evidence-based , multi-faceted intervention target Veterans follow PCI procedure improve adherence clopidogrel , reduces bleeding , myocardial infarction , stroke , mortality among patient , cost-effective . The propose intervention base Chronic Care Model build investigator ' pilot work well leverage VA 's CART-CL , uniform cath lab procedure report tool VA cath lab . The study evaluate use REAIM framework consist follow component , reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation maintenance . The intervention adapt elements prior successful intervention , include patient education , collaboration cath lab clinician impatient/outpatient pharmacy team , telemonitoring via interactive voice response ( IVR ) technology . This type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation study test 16 site randomize intervention average 90 patient per site per 6 month period versus usual care . Specific Aims : 1 . To evaluate current practice VA PCI facility ( n=20 ) enhance adherence clopidogrel , hospital discharge longitudinal follow-up . 2 . To implement multi-faceted intervention 16 total site 4 roll-out phase ( 4 site roll-out ) randomize stepped wedge trial design . 3 . To assess barrier facilitator intervention implementation roll-out phase semi-structured interview incorporate lesson learn roll-out phase subsequent roll-out phase . 4 . To determine effectiveness successfully-piloted , evidence-based , multi-faceted intervention versus usual care improve clopidogrel fill hospital discharge adherence clopidogrel ( primary outcome ) . 5 . To determine effectiveness successfully-piloted , evidence-based , multi-faceted intervention versus usual care reduce combine cardiovascular endpoint bleed , myocardial infarction , stroke , mortality ( secondary outcome ) . 6 . To assess incremental cost-effectiveness successfully-piloted , evidence-based , multi-faceted intervention compare usual care . II . Background Significance : The investigator successfully pilot intervention improve clopidogrel adherence follow PCI . The investigator develop software application integrate within CART-CL assess whether patient fill clopidogrel prescription hospital discharge . If clopidogrel fill , patient contact identify barrier medication filling . During follow-up , automate telephone call send patient educate importance medication adherence remind refill clopidogrel prior refill due date . The software application successfully identify 15 patient enrol pilot underwent PCI whether fill clopidogrel hospital discharge 2 VAMCs . In qualitative interview automate call , patient indicate refill reminder message helpful . A majority participant indicate felt education/support message participation study helpful would helpful others . A patient share message also support refill medication remind ask clarify question medication . Following successful pilot , investigator ' next step test effectiveness intervention study implementation process across range VA facility . Building prior work evidence literature , investigator develop intervention inform Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) framework use clinical information system facilitate evidence-based quality improvement . The investigator leverage CART-CL , IVR technology , patient self-management , team-based care foster efficient , productive interaction activate patient proactive clinical team improve clopidogrel adherence . Further component intervention directly address many reason patient highlight lead early clopidogrel discontinuation . This study refine current state knowledge improve medication adherence multiple way . First , combine multiple intervention separately show effective improve medication adherence address cause clopidogrel non-adherence identified patient . Second , intervention focus novel set ( i.e. , patient discharge follow PCI transition outpatient care ) contrast prior adherence intervention focus patient stable chronic disease ( e.g. , hypertension ) . Prior work investigator ' group others suggest immediate post-ACS period , generally transition inpatient outpatient setting , particularly 'vulnerable period ' medication adherence . Yet prior intervention specifically target set . Third , target medication study demonstrate short-term benefit non-adherence immediate adverse outcome ( e.g. , stent thrombosis ) . Prior study focus medication ( e.g. , hypertension medication ) non-adherence lead problem long term rather short term . Fourth , study utilizes exist resource ( i.e. , cardiac data system integrate VA electronic health record , VA pharmacists patient-aligned care team ) implement intervention , improve feasibility broad implementation . Prior adherence intervention generally require significant additional resource majority quality improvement intervention continue follow end research project . This proposal extend current state knowledge medication adherence demonstrate successful intervention need multiple evidence-based component , design plan implementation mind . Finally , study conduct type I hybrid implementation study therefore include extensive study implementation process , yield contribution implementation science facilitate wider dissemination intervention find effective . Furthermore , study make two important contribution implementation science . First , investigator integrate structure survey , organizational readiness change assessment ( ORCA ) , use formative summative evaluation ( describe evaluation plan ) . The ORCA previously psychometrically validate find predict implementation effectiveness . However , previously test tool support implementation . Findings study help u understand ORCA use support implementation project , contribute user ' material survey . Second , investigator use innovative study design , randomize step wedge design , building-in iterative formative evaluation guide implementation intervention sit subsequent cohort . As far investigator know , kind iterative rollout design plan formative evaluation use effectiveness/implementation hybrid study . If work plan , provide useful formative evaluation finding early cohort , may represent important adaptation hybrid design . In term VA patient care , intervention successful , increase adherence clopidogrel help patient take anti-platelet medication routinely prescribe , quality cardiovascular care Veterans since adherence clopidogrel associate reduction cardiovascular morbidity mortality follow PCI , efficiency care use telephone call telemonitoring communication patient rather clinic visit . This study leverage automate pharmacy system tele-monitoring technology VA nationally recognize leader . Further , study address important gap knowledge ( i.e. , improve adherence clopidogrel medication follow PCI ) finding inform future intervention improve adherence chronic cardiovascular medication . Finally , since study design implement use exist personnel/staff current national platform ( i.e. , CART-CL PACT teamlets ) , generalizable VA Medical Centers Veterans .</detailed_description>
