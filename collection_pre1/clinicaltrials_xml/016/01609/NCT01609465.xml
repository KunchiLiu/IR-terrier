	<brief_summary>There currently publish algorithm secondary prevention prognosis CHD representative England GP-registered population include symptomatic asymptomatic patient ( identify primary care ) . In paper investigator exploit routinely collect information clinical practice model CHD prognosis base large contemporary open cohort stable CAD patient . Although investigator model base data GP practice England , investigator believe population sufficiently heterogeneous term ethnic mix , socioeconomic background , predispose characteristic lifestyle generate prognostic model good generalize power wider population . Among research question investigator try answer whether establish risk factor primary care prevention ( smoking , hypertension , dyslipidaemia , diabetes ) also reliable risk-stratification patient already develop CAD . Similarly , investigator examine whether strong predictor adverse outcome ACS patient short term , admission SBP heart rate , also associate long term prognosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To use routinely collect primary care clinical audit ( MINAP ) data patient England develop validate prognostic model people stable CAD . 2 . To identify key prognostic factor progression MI fatal CHD compare strength among clinically important subgroup . 3 . To estimate risk distribution specific time horizon overall within clinically important subgroup . 4 . To use estimate derive model inform subsequent decision model relate e.g . selection patient CABG second-line anti-platelet agent ( e.g . clopidogrel ) . The outcome primary interest fatal CHD &amp; non-fatal MI . As secondary outcome model cause mortality . Incidence endpoint estimate period 5 year depend quality availability follow-up cohort . We may cautiously extend endpoint , include CVD endpoint reflect symptomatic status ( e.g . nitrate use ) . We plan follow reporting guideline set forthcoming work lead Atman Moons . Data method Data source Information extract CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) study . CALIBER collection public health data repository , link national myocardial infarction register rich longitudinal primary care record , secondary care data source highly phenotyped cohort UCL genetics consortium . Currently , CALIBER dataset compose linkage several datasets : - General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) 7 - Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) 8 - Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) 9 - Mortality data Office National Statistics ( ONS ) Setting study population Eligible general practice define practice meet standard acceptable level data recording ( i.e . audit demonstrate `` least 95 % relevant patient encounter record data meet quality standard epidemiological research '' 7 ) , consent linkage HES MINAP ( approximately 200 practice ) . To define incident case exclude patient observed year prior CAD diagnosis date . For prevalent case remove condition . Our startpoint population define patient age 18 year diagnose CAD , include : 1. patient diagnose stable angina 2. patient ACS ( STEMI , NSTEMI &amp; unstable angina ) survive &gt; 4 week . Patients CAD diagnosis receive revascularization follow-up enter cohort procedure ( give post-procedure survival &gt; 4 week ) . We cautiously define broad well specific startpoint population fully exploit information quantity richness CALIBER data . Thus , extend analysis prevalent CAD case incident cohort one four CAD subtypes ( stable angina , unstable angina , STEMI NSTEMI ) . The study start date define 1st January 2000 , order include patient cause-specific mortality data potentially available ( first link 1st January 2001 ) . The study period end 20th October , 2009 , last date linkage ONS mortality data . For patient determine right censor date , early follow date : date develop outcome interest , end study period ( 20 October 2009 ) , date non-coronary death , date leaving practice , last practice data collection date . Ethics The study use anonymised dataset GPRD , MINAP HES . The study protocol evaluate approved Independent Scientific Advisory Committee ( ISAC ) Medicines Healthcare product Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) ( ISAC protocol Nos 07-008 10-106 ) . The study register clinicaltrials.gov ( registration No TBC ) . Explanatory factor consider Initially , consider wide range risk factor biomarkers implicate coronary artery syndrome broadly available at/around time clinical review , include Framingham ( `` standard '' ) risk factor ( age , smoke status , blood pressure , cholesterol diabetes ) . Because , typically , risk factor measure concurrently day around time diagnosis define rule select 'baseline ' measurement handle conflict overlap value GPRD MINAP ( arise ) . Our selection drawn : 1. demographic , include age diagnosis , ethnicity index multiple deprivation ( IMD ) 2. lifestyle , include smoke alcohol consumption 3. blood pressure-related , include SBP , DBP , prescription anti-hypertensives , diagnose hypertension , pulse rate pulse pressure 4. lipids-related , include total cholesterol , HDL , triglycerides prescription statins 5. diabetes-related , include diagnosis type I II diabetes , diabetes medication , fast plasma glucose , Hb1Ac BMI 6. biomarkers , include creatinine haemoglobin 7 . Secondary prevention medication ( aspirin , clopidogrel , beta-blockers , ACE inhibitors beta-blockers ) 8 . Previous intervention ( PCI CABG ) 9 . CVD severity , include angiographic finding ( normal/abnormal leave ventricular function ) , CV-coexisting condition ( stroke , peripheral artery disease ) previous MI consultation frequency ( within last year ) 10 . Non-CV co-morbidities , major chapter include Charlson index 11 . For ACS patient also consider information specifically record MINAP relation hospital episode ( acute pulse rate , acute SBP DBP beta-troponin ) . Treatment miss value Where possible , repeated measurement use replace miss data baseline record . The approach base set rule transfer measurement different consultation reconcile measurement different source develop CALIBER project . The remain miss value replace predicted value multiple imputation framework , implement R package 'mice ' ( version 2 ) . This version 'mice ' handle miss random ( MAR ) miss random ( MNAR ) pattern . To identify suitable model impute variable take follow approach : • compute correlation matrix select strong predictor miss data variable • ass miss data pattern , proportion covariate distribution • identify strength association outcome interest ( fit Cox model variable ) - identify suitable imputation model simplify possible ( always include standard risk factor predictor expect include prognostic model base clinical importance ) - decide order variable would impute ( e.g . order decrease missingness , correlation and/or predictive power ) . All imputation model include outcome interest ( CHD death non-fatal MI ) previously describe 10 . Imputation form part variable selection model estimation describe later . Variable selection We select final model base combination approach include statistical performance clinical feasibility . Our aim arrive generalizable , efficiently estimable model , time , sensitive enough capture much heterogeneity target population . We assess statistical performance CoxPH model outcome ( ) interest . Sex include adjusted stratify variable depend whether proportional hazard ( PH ) assumption satisfy . It possible patient different practice differ underlie risk ( e.g . due regional variation case-mix ) . Hence , test PH assumption respect sex-specific baseline hazard GP practice data . If PH assumption violate estimate Cox model within practice combine coefficient random effect meta-analysis . If PH assumption satisfy assume baseline hazard across practice indicate cluster patient ( GP practice ) model estimate robust variance . We choose timescale Cox model base preliminary analysis explore two alternative , age-at-risk time event/censoring . Our choice base largely age-spread diagnosis case cohort timescale likely few PH violation . In step 1 explore univariate association candidate predictor primary endpoint term strength shape association evaluate plausible interaction age , time sex . Where shape differ significantly linearity consider flexible modelling , use restricted-cubic spline . Proportional hazard assess examine Schoenfield residual . Variables low statistical significance consider unless strong clinical reason . In step 2 follow data-driven approach identify important variable among retained step 1 multivariate context . For use stepwise regression , implement fastbw function 'rms ' R package ( ref ) , force candidate model standard risk factor . We apply algorithm separately panel candidate predictor , e.g . blood pressure variable , CVD severity etc ensure least 1 predictor group represent final model . As general rule p &gt; 0.1 lack strong association univariate setting consider evidence exclusion . The step couple multiple imputation , previously recommended11 , use efficient unbiased approach among option propose problem hand . Final selection base assess several candidate model similar statistical performance use criterion , proportion non-imputed data , measurement reliability , clinical feasibility clinician ' advice . Once variable include model select update imputation model ( necessary ) include variable . Not could bias association null12 . Estimation Estimation coefficient risk need incorporate three type uncertainty : • Uncertainty due imputation miss data ( dealt incorporate between-imputation variation ) • Uncertainty estimation model parameter ( deal cross-validation ) - Sensitivity data sample ( dealt bootstrapping data ) To perform 10-fold cross-validation data randomly divide 10 subgroup . The risks individual subgroup q estimate fit Cox model subgroup except subgroup q . Repeating subgroup q=1 , ..,10 yield predict risks individual . As sensitivity analysis repeat cross-validation procedure split GP-practice instead randomly across practice . Estimation proceed follow : 1 . All predictor select final model miss data impute base imputation model select earlier step . 2 . CoxPH model fit ( cross-validation ) endpoint interest treat non-CHD death censor observation . 3 . CoxPH model fit ( cross-validation ) non-CHD treat MI fatal CHD censor observation . 4 . Risks estimate individual adjust non-CHD mortality base cause-specific Cox model formula describe Kalbfleisch &amp; Prentice13 . 5 . Standard error obtain repeat step 2 4 suitable number ( 200 ) bootstrap sample . 6 . The procedure repeat step 1 another 4 round imputation obtain imputation variance . 7 . Estimates combine use Rubin 's rule . Evaluation Most standard method model evaluation assume absolute risk ( adjust compete risk ) . Because deal cumulative incidence ( i.e . risk adjust non-CVD mortality ) modify evaluation approach accordingly . • Calibration check group prediction decile compute mean risk within decile compete risks-adjusted Kaplan-Meier ( i.e . cumulative incidence ) risk group . - Discrimination check overall age-specific manner use formulation C-index allow adjust compete risks14 . Finally , compare performance ( possible ) publish risk algorithm , GRACE15 REACH3 refer similar start population outcomes . To , fit model use set covariates include publish algorithm compare propose new model . Because clinically meaningful risk threshold exist secondary CHD prevention yet use metric require risk stratification . Possible example continuous NRI16 Brier score . Statistical software version R version 13.1 appropriate add-on package .</detailed_description>
