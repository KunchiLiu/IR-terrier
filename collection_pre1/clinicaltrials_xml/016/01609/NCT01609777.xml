	<brief_title>HandSAFE - Development Evaluation Handover Tool Doctors Nurses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical transfer ICU critical part patient care . Ensuring consistency information pass within intensive care unit i.e . shift shift different functional area ( eg ICU surgery ) ensure . Incorrect , incomplete incomprehensible information context severe consequence jeopardize patient safety . Research handovers high risk organization associate high risk error , space flight control center show potential consequence result incomplete handover . Apart flaw mental model state system , respective recipient handover able anticipate possible future event respond accordingly . The main barrier implement effective handover medical setting follow factor : The medical clinical context ( constant background noise lack privacy ) ; organizational hierarchy status difference , may lead submitter stress , well linguistic cultural barrier may impede communication . To counter barrier , variety memory aid ( tool ) design structure handover along define cornerstone . Examples handover tool LAURS ( Listen , Accept , Utilize , Reframe , Suggest ) SBAR ( Situation , Background , Assessment , Recommendation ) . These memory aid facilitate problem-centered consistent delivery information . This however neglect crucial fact : psychological perspective , intensive care unit present multi-team system . This mean different functional group ( Senior doctor , assistant doctor nurse ) work together towards common goal , ie treatment patient . However handover occur mostly parallel different functional area , hamper consistent exchange information group . This turn may reduce team effectiveness lead error treatment patient . For reason , handover tool support information flow within function group , also various functional group . The previous research communication physicians nurse suggest perceive psychological safety important prerequisite overcome perceive status difference , thus effective efficient teamwork . Another crucial variable joint achievement goal degree perceive team collaboration i.e . cooperation doctor nurse . If two parameter - psychological safety team collaboration - met insufficient , may lead lack information , also reactance group . This turn lead inefficient faulty handover thus fatally compromise patient safety . The aim propose study , therefore , development evaluation tool - handSAFE - design increase problem-centered structure handover .</detailed_description>
