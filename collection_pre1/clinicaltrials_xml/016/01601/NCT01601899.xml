	<brief_title>Differences Between Stavudine Tenofovir Each Combined With Lamivudine Efavirenz SA HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There major improvement survival HIV-infected individual role highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) public health sector South African Government 2004 . Despite unparalleled benefit HAART , increase recognition adverse event remain important source morbidity even mortality . Knowledge adverse effect different therapeutic regime understanding genetic factor modulate risk toxicity , important management HIV/AIDS patient . There two regimen offer public sector , contain triple drug course , either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) . With adherence treatment , possible convert HIV fatal infection chronic manageable illness . But , unfortunately , therapeutic regimen associate development metabolic complication , dyslipidaemia , insulin resistance . Occasionally frank diabetes , alter fat distribution , peripheral lipoatrophy centripetal fat accumulation . There grow concern complication may lead increase long-term risk cardiovascular disease individual . The first regime contains stavudine , NRTI . It cheap easy administer short term however associate side effect , relatively high rate long term risk lipoatrophy , peripheral neuropathy . It also associate asymptomatic sometimes fatal lactic acidosis , also associate complication myopathy pancreatitis . However , study suggest reduce d4T dose improves toxicity profile maintain efficacy . Tenofovir hand , nucleotide analogue , approved 2001 United States , use grow since approval . It commonly use initial therapy . It show favourable lipid mt DNA profile compare stavudine , however difference virological response . Clinical practice move increasingly towards use regime combine high level tolerability efficacy . HIV-infected individual develop pattern similar metabolic syndrome initiate treatment , ultimately put risk impend cardiovascular disease next decade . Most study do West , data patient third world country include South Africa . This purpose study prospectively identify difference two different NRTIs , Stavudine , nucleoside analogue ( different dos ) , Tenofovir , nucleotide analogue , assess virological response , molecular , biochemical clinical picture , possible associate change cardiovascular risk factor , , South African setting , make recommendation modify current National AIDS role programme Primary Objectives The following question address : 1 . To determine molecular difference ( start treatment ) regimens . 2 . To determine biochemical difference ( start treatment ) three regimen . 3 . To determine clinical difference patient three arm treatment . Secondary Objectives The following question address : 1 . To determine outcome immune reconstitution monitor T-cell subset change . 2 . To determine virological response monitor viral load change . 3 . To determine three treatment arm result good adherence . 4 . To determine change cardiovascular risk factor treatment . Study Design This randomise control study compare two NRTIs , nucleoside analogue Stavudine ( standard dose , low dose ) , nucleotide analogue Tenofovir , combine Lamivudine Efavirenz HIV-infected treatment-naïve patient conduct concurrently . This study compare virologic response , molecular , biochemical clinical difference treatment arm . At entry , participant enrol either Arm A , B C randomization . Duration:48 week randomization final participant.From enrollment , participant minimum four study visit . Sample size:90 participant randomize ( 1:1:1 ) either Arm A ( 30 participant ) , Arm B ( 30 participant ) Arm C ( 30 participant ) . Population : HIV-infected , treatment-naïve patient , least 18 year age , CD4+ cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 . At study entry , participant randomize ( describe ) one follow treatment arm : Arm A Stavudine ( d4T ) 30 mg po BD wt &lt; 60kg , 40 mg po BD wt &gt; 60kg PLUS Lamivudine ( 3TC ) 150mg po BD PLUS Efavirenz 600mg po nocte OR Arm B Stavudine ( d4T ) 20 mg po BD wt &lt; 60kg , 30 mg po BD wt &gt; 60kg PLUS Lamivudine ( 3TC ) 150mg po BD PLUS Efavirenz 600mg po nocte OR Arm C TDF 300 mg po QD PLUS Lamivudine ( 3TC ) 150mg po BD PLUS Efavirenz 600mg po nocte</detailed_description>

Participants reproductive age ( defined girl reach menarche woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , i.e . menses within precede 24 month ) , undergone surgical sterilization ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy salpingotomy ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 45 day prior study entry . 7 . Participants reproductive potential , must willing abstain participation conception process ( e.g . active attempt become pregnant vitro fertilization ) . If participant sexual active , could lead pregnancy , must use least one reliable form contraception list receive protocolspecified medication 6 week stop medication . Male female condom without spermicidal agent ( condom recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV transmission ) . Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide IUD Hormonalbased contraception Possible interaction study drug estrogenbased contraceptive : LPV/RTV decrease plasma level ethinyl estradiol ; therefore , estrogenbased contraceptive reliable woman receive LPV/RTV alternative contraception method must use . NOTE : Participants reproductive potential ( girl reach menarche , woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ) girl woman participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , woman undergo surgical sterilization , ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy salpingotomy ) eligible without require use contraception . 8 .
