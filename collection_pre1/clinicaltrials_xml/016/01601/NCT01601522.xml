	<brief_title>Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Desensitization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic reaction peanut tree nut account majority fatal near fatal food allergic reaction , treatment complete avoidance peanut . Despite avoidance , majority peanut allergic people accidently ingest peanut . OIT show desensitize peanut allergic subject ( Hofmann et al . 2009 ) . This would protect patient treatment , may even form basis true tolerance peanut future . To determine dose kinetics peanut desensitization ( clinically immunologically ) peanut allergic individual undergo low high dose OIT . To examine whether severity peanut allergy determine measurement PAF PAF AH ( possible marker reaction severity ) correlate ability patient undergo OIT achieve desensitization To assess quality life peanut allergic subject OIT</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 5 10 year age . Patients confirm peanut allergy base history significant clinical symptom within 60 minute ingestion peanut , presence specific IgE peanut ( positive skin prick test peanut , define wheal 3 mm large saline control ; positive vitro IgE [ CAPFEIA ] result &gt; 15 kU/L.. Patients also accept study clinical reaction peanut ingestion within past 6 month , positive skin prick test peanut define previously , vitro peanut IgE ( CAPFEIA ) result 7 kU/L great . Subjects must free clinically significant disease may interfere study evaluation . Use antihistamines decongestant therapy 7 day prior clinic visit . ( antihistamines eg . diphenhydramine , desloratadine etc throughout desensitization phase study . Patients acute allergic reaction food peanut , drug , sting insect one month prior recruitment clinic visit Patients respiratory infection one month prior recruitment clinic visit . Patients significant uncontrolled asthma , ( inhaled corticosteroid ( fluticasone &gt; 500 mcg per day , ciclesonide &gt; 400 mcg per day budesonide &gt; 800 mcg per day correspond combination inhaler , oral prednisone precede 1 month FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict ) . Nasal steroid , bronchodilator leukotriene inhibitor permit . If Prednisone take , must also stop 1 month prior blood drawn possible . Patients receive allergy injection ( immunotherapy ) environmental allergens time past . Symptomatic atopic dermatitis chronic urticaria may interfere ability evaluate oral immunotherapy /or require daily medication include antihistamine . Patients problem related compliance follow study instruction . Inability come hospital every 2 week dose escalation .</criteria>
