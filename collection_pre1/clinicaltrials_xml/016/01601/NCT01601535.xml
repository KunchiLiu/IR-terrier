	<brief_summary>The goal first part clinical trial ( Phase I portion ) study side effect , drug breakdown ( pharmacokinetics ) , dose drug MLN8237 add standard chemotherapy drug , irinotecan temozolomide . The goal second part clinical trial ( Phase II portion ) learn many child young adult show improvement neuroblastoma treat combination MLN8237 , irinotecan , temozolomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study MLN8237 Combination With Irinotecan Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Aurora A kinase show play important role neuroblastoma growth . Inhibition Aurora A kinase activity attenuate growth neuroblastoma cell . MLN8237 selective small molecule inhibitor Aurora A kinase complete pediatric single-agent phase I test , well stage 1 phase 2 test patient Neuroblastoma . MLN8237 show activity NCI-sponsored Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program neuroblastoma vivo panel exceed activity level observe chemotherapy agent routinely use treatment neuroblastoma . Additional vitro vivo study show Aurora A kinase inhibitor result enhanced cytotoxicity use combination chemotherapy . Irinotecan temozolomide commonly use salvage regimen patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma . This combination modest objective response rate ( 16 % ) well-tolerated , suggest provide useful platform study novel compound combination chemotherapy . Preclinical study demonstrate mark enhancement anti-neuroblastoma activity addition MLN8237 irinotecan temozolomide . This study therefore evaluate tolerability activity MLN8237 combination irinotecan temozolomide child refractory relapse neuroblastoma . Patients receive irinotecan ( 50 mg/m2/dose IV ) temozolomide ( 100 mg/m2/dose orally ) daily 5 day along MLN8237 orally daily 7 day . The dos irinotecan temozolomide fix dose MLN8237 dose-escalated . In phase I portion study , primary aim determine recommend phase II dose combination , describe toxicity combination , characterize pharmacokinetic profile MLN8237 irinotecan use combination . In phase II portion study , primary aim determine objective response rate combination patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma . With Amendment 5 , tolerability pharmacokinetics MLN8237 oral solution evaluate . Optional correlative study evaluate UGT1A1 polymorphism predictor toxicity archival tumor tissue Aurora A expression predictor response combination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria need meet participate study : Patients must &gt; 12 month &lt; 30 year age register study . Patients must relapse neuroblastoma , refractory neuroblastoma less partial response standard treatment persistent neuroblastoma least partial response standard treatment . All patient must least ONE site evaluable disease . Patients least partial response standard treatment still neuroblastoma see CT/MRI MIBG scan must surgical biopsy do tumor confirm neuroblastoma . Patients relapse refractory neuroblastoma need biopsy do enter study . Patients must adequate heart , kidney , liver bone marrow function . Patients bone marrow disease must still adequate bone marrow function enter study . MLN8237 must swallow whole tablet . Therefore , patient must able swallow pill eligible study . One tablet size small breath mint , baby aspirin . Due size MLN8237 tablet , patient must body surface area least 0.38 m2 eligible study . A body surface area combination patient 's height weight . An example child BSA 0.45 child 25 inch tall weigh 25 pounds.You use link calculate child 's body surface area determine small trial . Patients participate study : Patients receive prior MLN8237 exclude phase study . Patients previously treat irinotecan and/or temozolomide eligible document progressive disease treatment regimen contain agent . They medical problem could get much bad treatment . They dialysis bad kidney function . They pregnant breast feed . They active infection hepatitis fungal infection . They allergy treatment cefixime cefpodixime . They brain metastasis study entry , receive cranial spinal radiation . They allogeneic stem cell transplant ( received stem cell someone else ) . They ca n't cooperate special precaution need trial .</criteria>
