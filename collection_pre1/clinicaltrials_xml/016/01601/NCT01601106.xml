	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity mortality develop nation . CVD primarily cause atherosclerosis , systemic disease characterize lipid deposition subendothelial space concomitant , low-grade inflammatory reaction . ( Fuster , Moreno et al . 2005 ) To date , therapeutic intervention aim lower CVD thus far focused modulate lipid level , either lower LDLc increase HDLc level . Yet , since introduction statins 20 year ago , breakthrough treatment disease . A promising strategy reduce CVD directly target inflammation level vessel wall . ( van Leuven , van Wijk et al . ; Libby 2002 ) A potential drawback anti-inflammatory strategy pertains thin line inhibit 'inappropriate ' inflammation versus induce immuno-suppression . Therefore , continuous low dose anti-inflammatory drug great potential novel treatment strategy . In present project , investigator propose inject liposomal glucocorticoid intravenously patient increase risk atherosclerotic disease aim reduce vessel wall inflammation .</brief_summary>
