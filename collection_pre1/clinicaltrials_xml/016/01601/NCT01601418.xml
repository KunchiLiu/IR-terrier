	<brief_title>Effect Single Doses YF476 Stomach Acidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale study follow . On basis pre-clinical study , original target disease YF476 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) , excellent anti-secretory activity YF476 also potential increase gastric emptying . But loss anti-secretory effect YF476 healthy subject repeat dose excludes use anti-secretory agent patient GORD . However , evidence within repeated-dose study healthy subject gastrin receptor block despite loss anti-secretory activity YF476 . Further evidence repeat dos YF476 cause sustain blockade gastrin receptor come several type study animal . First , 13-week toxicology study , dose level YF476 reduce ECL population , unlike anti-secretory agent , histamine H2-antagonists proton-pump inhibitor , increase ECL population . Second , YF476 dose 0.1 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily 14 day rat abolish increase gastric output induce pentagastrin Days 1 , 7 14 . This protocol describe study healthy subject use inhibition pentagastrin-induced gastric acid output surrogate marker efficacy YF476 . Pentagastrin use many year test gastric function healthy subject patient . Intravenous infusion 0.6 micrograms/kg/hour submaximal well-tolerated dose .</detailed_description>
