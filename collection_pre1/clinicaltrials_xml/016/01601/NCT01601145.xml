	<brief_summary>The aim present research protocol evaluate effect probiotic daily use , plaque acidogenicity child . The null hypothesis plaque acidogenicity would remain unchanged associate use probiotic . Moreover , situ study carry investigate plaque formation biofilm demineralise enamel specimen follow regular consumption probiotic product compare control group . Metabolic biofilm form enamel specimen result consumption evaluate period 8 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Probiotic Plaque pH . A Randomized Double Blind Interventional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior start study , demographic , ethnic prognostic data collect ( screen phase ) . A medical history take , documentation previous concomitant treatment clinical examination oral cavity ( dental status , oral mucosa ) perform investigator . If test subject meet inclusion criterion without fulfil exclusion criterion , he/she enrol clinical trial give test subject identification number . All test subject receive patient diary screening phase . Washout phase I ( 1 week ) : The test subject use fluoride-containing toothpaste provide sponsor daily oral hygiene . A soft toothbrush likewise provide . The test subject also receive patient diary inform treatment phase may use fluoride contain oral hygiene product ( tooth-paste , mouthwash , gel etc . ) study tooth-paste , drink fluoride-containing mineral water black tea , eat fish meal . Treatment phase I ( 6 week ) : Following washout phase I , test subject start first treatment phase . Plaque pH measurement 1 week . All subject instruct oral hygiene consumption study product . Treatment phase II ( 1 week ) : The test subject use fluoride-containing toothpaste provide sponsor daily oral hygiene . A soft toothbrush likewise provide . Plaque pH measurement . 1 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 1.1 Clinical parameter DMFT index , gingival index 1.2 Investigation saliva factor Saliva factor pH flow rate measure screen phase three day , time morning . The mean three measurement calculate . The Dentobuff® test kit ( Vivadent , Liechtenstein ) use . 1.3 Teeth brushing technique Test subject require clean teeth three time day fluoride-containing toothpaste soft toothbrush . During time , fresh , damp gauze ( soaked water ) place container day order provide moist atmosphere appliance . The specimen allow dry . The enamel specimens likewise carefully clean soft toothbrush except last day every period . 1.4 Randomization Using computer program ( Excel 2003 Mac OsX ) , randomization carry individual basis . 1.5 Application study product The subject allow chew lozenge . They allow swallow lozenge . 1.6 Plaque-pH evaluation At end phase plaque acidogenicity assess use MicroTouch technique previous sucrose challenge . Evaluations pH carry specimen . The pH measure quintuplicate 6 different time point : baseline ( sucrose rinse ) 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 30 min 1-min rinse 10 ml 10 % sucrose , use active movement . An iridium touch microelectrode ( diameter 0.1 mm ; Beetrode® NMPH-1 , World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , Fla. , USA , porous glass reference electrode ( MERE 1 , World Precision Instruments ) use . A salt bridge create KCl ( 3 M ) solution reference electrode finger subject . Before session pH evaluation , electrode calibrate use buffer solution pH 7.00 4.00 . 2 . STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 2.1 Planned Analysis Descriptive summary statistic compute parameter document case report form ( CRF ) . Quantitative parameter describe seven-point scale mean , standard deviation , median , quartile , minimum maximum . Absolute relative frequency give qualitative variable . All description do separately treatment group visit . The full statistical analysis include detail method deal outlier , miss value , data prohibit concomitant medication , prohibit nutrition possible irregularity fix detailed statistical analysis plan , updated blind review data apply randomisation code data final analysis . In order ensure database accurately reflect data report CRF , double data entry procedure ( data enter different staff two separate data file ) use . In addition electronic comparison two data file validation data check range , consistency plausibility . Unclear data undergo data clean process ( `` query '' ) . Any change apply data database data cleaning record special log file . The database frozen completion data cleaning . Appropriate validate software ( e.g . SAS , SPSS ) use data process statistical evaluation . Confirmative statistical test For confirmative statistical test analysis variance ( ANOVA ) model use global test , include treatment sequence `` subject factor '' treatment condition `` within subject factor '' . The full analysis describe detail specific statistical analysis plan unblinding data . Adjustment type I error due multiple test necessary due prior order hypothesis . Hypothesis test stop null-hypothesis may reject 5 % error level α . This procedure maintain constant global level α = 5 % .</detailed_description>
