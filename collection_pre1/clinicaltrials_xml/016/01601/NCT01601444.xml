	<detailed_description>Early detection pleural effusion ( PLE ) would improve treatment . However , preclinical detection pleural effusion often possible . Radiographic examination , widely use detect pleural effusion , suitable prolonged monitoring patient high risk develop PLE especially ambulatory home ( 1-9 ) . The currently available method monitor early detection measurement pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurement double indicator thermodilution , reliable enough may lead complication ( 2-8 ) . Yu C-M et al . ( 9 ) recently report successful prediction CPE surgically implant impedance plethysmograph integrate pacemaker . The system show sufficiently sensitive cardiogenic pulmonary edema preceding . However method invasive suitable wide use ( 9 ) . Therefore , method seldom employ detection PLE ( 3-7 ) . Thus , safe accurate technique early detection monitoring PlEf would great clinical value . The change blood extravascular fluid content lung human animal easily monitor use noninvasive totally safe procedure base impedance plethysmography ( 5-12- ) . This method base fact impedance lung decrease increase fluid free ion content ( 8,13 , ) . However , prove unsuitable preclinical stage monitoring PLE ( 2-8 ) several reason , mainly low sensitivity exist impedance plethysmograph . This due high skin-electrode contact resistance ( 13,14 ) , order magnitude high erthan impedance lung . After clean skin fat alcohol moisten electrode paste , value skin electrode contact resistance approximately 400- 500 ohm ( 11-13 ) . Therefore , two measure electrode ( front back chest ) , value must 800-1000 ohm . Total transthoracic impedance ( TTI ) consist internal thoracic impedance ( ITI ) skin contact impedance . The TTI may vary 920 1230 ohm different individual ( 11-13 ) . However , change TTI PLE report others vary range 2-16 ohm ( 7-9 , 11-18 ) , approximately1 % TTI 1.5 % skin contact impedance . Monitors use previous work sensitive enough detect relatively small change pulmonary impedance ( 2-7 ) . In addition , prolong monitoring , skin-electrode contact impedance may also change ( 13,14 ) due penetration ion sweat electrode paste dry paste . It may significantly exceed change impedance lung cause development cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( 2-7 ) . Kubicek et al . ( 10 ) attempt develop method tetrapolar electrode system use overcome problem . However , system measure impedance entire chest , large part electrical field concentrate surface tissue , considerably reduce sensitivity method ( 10,11 ) . Furthermore , Kubicek 's electrode may burdensome critically ill patient prolong monitoring require . The main disadvantage sensitive method surgical implantation electrode ( 10,13 ) A new impedance monitor , model RS- 207 EDEMA GUARD MONITOR ( R. S. Medical Monitoring , Jerusalem , Israel ) , develop ( 15 ) . The monitor design also solve problem drift skin-to-electrode electrical resistance drift prolong monitoring separate ITI skin-to-electrode electrical resistance . The result mention action value Internal Thoracic Electrical Resistance ( Impedance ) - ITI . The method ITI estimation completely describe Rabinovich ( 15 ) Unlike exist impedance monitor , new monitor measure ITI , roughly equal lung impedance , automatically calculate skin electrode impedance subtract TTI . According publish data , ITI range 40 100 ohm individual without CPE , average , decrease 30 ohm , i.e. , by30 % 75 % CPE ( 11-12,16-21 ) . These result show much high sensitivity compare 1.5 % change find use TTI method . This average 35- fold increase ( range , 20- 50-fold intraindividual constitutional difference ) impedance plethysmograph sensitivity compare method without substraction skin electrode resistance ( 2-8 ) . This monitor succefully use early detection pulmonary edema however expearence pleural fluid detection. ( 11,12,16-20 . ) The aim present study evaluate suitability RS-207 monitoring PlEf clinical preclinical stage . The test consider successful ITI low decrease parallel appearance clinical sign radiograph finding compatible PlEf , demonstrably increase resolution . Considerations purpose Previous study base measurement ITI early diagnosis pulmonary edema show suitability RS-207 . There study deal early diagnosis pleural effusion simple nonexpencive method use ICU ambulatory Measuring ITI , main component lung impedance , noninvasive safe method . PLE diagnose accordance well-accepted clinical sign ( dyspnea , cyanosis , pulmonary rale , crepitation , arterial hypoxemia ) roentgenological criterion . The consideration study : evaluation suitability RS-205 monitor detect PLE preclinical stage appearance clinical sign assessment early treatment demonstrate increase ITI resolution .</detailed_description>
