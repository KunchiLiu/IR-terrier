	<brief_summary>There rapidly-growing need identify evidence-based , safe , effective co-treatment regimen HIV-related tuberculosis ( TB ) among patient require protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy . This study compare three alternative co-treatment option among participant high TB endemic resource-constrained setting , one co-treatment option explore additional anti-HIV drug need use patient treat protease inhibitor together rifabutin-based anti-TB treatment . Accrual take place two accrual period . Accrual period 1 enroll 60 participant undergo initial dose-finding period continue regular study follow-up . Once review dose-finding pharmacokinetic safety data accrual period 1 participant complete , accrual period 2 begin .</brief_summary>
