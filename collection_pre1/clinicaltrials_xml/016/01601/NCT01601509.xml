	<detailed_description>Nasal obstruction impairs sleep quality may predispose snore obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) [ 1 ] . Indeed , healthy subject , experimental nasal occlusion show elicit obstructive apnoeas [ 2 ] . Additionally , patient OSA nasal obstruction consider risk factor development OSA [ 3 ] . Despite relationship nasal obstruction OSA , therapeutic effect improve nasal airway patency OSA severity remain point conjecture [ 4 ] . In fact , administration intranasal corticosteroid show improve sleepiness reduce apnoea/hypopnoea index ( AHI ) patient OSA rhinitis [ 5 ] , whereas OSA patient nasal obstruction use topical decongestant , external nasal dilator nasal surgery provide equivocal result [ 6 ] . The present author demonstrate strong correlation apnoea-hypopnoea index oral/oro-nasal breathing epoch patient OSA normal nasal resistance [ 7 ] . Additionally , Kohler et al [ 8 ] show nasal resistance may increase sleep reflect substantial variability . Therefore , plausible hypothesize OSA patient present normal nasal resistance awake may demonstrate increase nocturnal nasal resistance sleep may predispose oral/oro-nasal breathing elicit apnoea/hypopnoeas . Prevention nocturnal nasal obstruction OSA patient may decrease oral/oro-nasal breathing eventually beneficial OSA decrease apnoea/hypopnoeas . Thus , present study aim investigate whether pharmacological prevention nasal obstruction could alter breathe route pattern lead decrease number apnoea/hypopnoeas OSA patient normal nasal resistance . The study include two nasal treatment option . Firstly , combination nasal decongestant ( tramazoline ) nasal corticosteroid ( dexamethazone ) . Tramazoline ( imidazoline derivative ) nasal decongestant , attain maximal effect 30 210 min application [ 9 ] , nasal dexamethasone attenuate nasal inflammation associate OSA [ 10 ] . Secondly , sodium chloride ( 0.9 % solution ) . OSA patient ( AHI &gt; 10 events/h ) normal nasal resistance measure seat supine position active anterior posterior rhinomanometry ( &lt; 3.0 cmH20•L-1•s ) recruit . Exclusion criterion consider : 1 ) recent surgery involve upper airway , 2 ) central apnoeas three per hour five percent total apnoeas , 3 ) total sleep time polysomnographies less three hour , 4 ) current treatment nasal decongestant topical steroid , 5 ) upper low respiratory tract disease , include history nasal allergy , 6 ) smoking . A randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over design use ( Figure 1 ) . Every patient undergo four assessment take place 24-48 hour treatment arm . Every assessment consist overnight polysomnography concomitant measurement breathe route pattern ( oral , nasal , oro-nasal breathing epoch ) previously describe [ 7 ] , along nasal resistance measurement . After baseline assessment randomization patient first group undergo one-week therapy nasal tramazoline dexamethazone , patient second group undergo one-week therapy nasal placebo ( sodium chloride , 0.9 % solution ) . The second assessment take place end one week regimen . A washout period two week follow . Subsequently , third assessment take place next patient first group undergo one-week therapy nasal placebo ( sodium chloride , 0.9 % solution ) , patient second group undergo one-week therapy nasal tramazoline dexamethazone . Fourth assessment follow . Figure 1 . Study design First group : one First group : one week nasal week nasal placebo tramazoline dexamethazone 2 week washout period Second group : one Second group : one week nasal placebo week nasaltramazoline dexamethazone First Assessment Second Assessment Third Assessment Fourth Assessment</detailed_description>
