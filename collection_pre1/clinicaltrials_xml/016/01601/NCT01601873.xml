	<brief_title>Propaten Randomized Investigation Cost-benefit Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This prospective , multi-institution , parallel-group , single-blinded , randomized-controlled , two-arm , effectiveness study compare heparin-bonded ( Propaten® ) versus non-heparin-bonded arteriovenous graft . Procedure : In patient without usable native vein , prosthetic arteriovenous graft implant hemodialysis access . Patients randomize intraoperatively either conventional ( Gore® Stretch ) heparin-bonded graft ( Gore® Propaten ) . Course Study : The study accrue patient course 5 year . Enrollment : Enrollment consist adult patient require hemodialysis . If patient native vein arteriovenous fistula , patient candidate arteriovenous graft . Patients screen consent preoperatively . If intraoperative decision make patient require graft , randomization occur patient consider enrol . Recruitment : The target population comprise adult patient age 18 year end stage renal disease require arteriovenous access hemodialysis . The target enrollment 200 patient . Risks : The standard know adverse event associate graft implantation include thrombosis , infection , pseudoaneurysm , hematoma , venous stenosis . There case report heparin sensitivity . The investigator expect additional physical risk unintentional disclosure sensitive patient health information . Data Safety Monitoring : As Principal Investigator study , Dr. Charlton-Ouw Department Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery The University Texas Houston Medical School conduct data safety monitoring study . He annually meet co-investigators review patient enrol study . As part data safety monitoring plan , patient enrol point time would unblinded order review outcomes . Interim analyse conduct one-year follow time . IND # : The device use already approve FDA IND # . Proposed Funding Source : The study internally fund . Communication Study Results : The communication study result occur authorized individual list take part study department . The individual take part study acknowledge adhere importance patient safety protection private information . The result study analyzed publish approval principal investigator , co-investigators , biostatistician peer-reviewed scientific journal and/or present international/national scientific conference meeting regardless outcome .</detailed_description>
