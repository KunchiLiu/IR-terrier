	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective study investigate association amount residual urine asymptomatic bacterial prostate infection occurrence recurrent ( &gt; 2 /year ) symptomatic urinary tract infection patient suffer chronic ( &gt; 1 year ) spinal cord injury ( SCI ) neurogenic low urinary tract dysfunction perform intermittent catheterization . The following hypothesis test : 1 . The amount residual urine intermittent catheterization significantly great SCI patient suffer frequent ( &gt; 2 /year ) urinary tract infection compare without . 2 . The incidence asymptomatic bacterial prostate infection significantly high SCI patient suffer frequent ( &gt; 2 /year ) urinary tract infection compare without .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To investigate association amount residual urine asymptomatic bacterial prostate infection occurrence recurrent ( &gt; 2 /year ) symptomatic urinary tract infection patient suffer chronic ( &gt; 1 year ) spinal cord injury ( SCI ) neurogenic low urinary tract dysfunction perform intermittent catheterization , patient perform self-catheterization twice ( urodynamic testing . After catheterization , residual urine assess ultrasound . Prior urodynamic testing , prostate massage perform , bacterial culture fluid urine initiate result culture analyse .</detailed_description>
