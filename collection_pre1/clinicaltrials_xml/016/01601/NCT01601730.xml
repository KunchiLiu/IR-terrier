	<brief_title>Modafinil - Escitalopram Study Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In application , propose augmentation strategy intend improve efficacy modafinil potential treatment cocaine dependence . Recent data indicate chronic treatment modafinil produce substantial dopamine transporter ( DAT ) inhibition . Given cocaine inhibits DA , norepenepherine ( NE ) serotonin ( 5-HT ) reuptake , highly likely target one neurotransmitter system necessary medication effective . Assuming statement true , hypothesize combination pharmacotherapeutic approach concurrently modulate multiple neurotransmitter system likely demonstrate clinically significant level efficacy trial single medication use . The propose approach base preclinical data indicate medication increase brain 5-HT level reduce effect stimulant . We hypothesize combine modafinil selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , increase synaptic level 5-HT , improve efficacy modafinil reduce effect produce cocaine . Specific Aims : 1 ) determine effect treatment oral modafinil ( 0 200 mg ) plus SSRI escitalopram ( 0 20 mg ) subjective reinforcing effect produce intravenous cocaine ( 0 20 mg ) laboratory . 2 ) characterize cocaine dependent population genetic basis rewarding effect produce cocaine . 3 ) characterize effect modafinil treatment cocaine exposure onBrain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) plasma . We hypothesize modafinil treatment cocaine exposure alter plasma level BDNF . 4 ) provide frequent measure heart rate ( 15 sec vs. 5 minute ) b ) measure new dependent variable , physical activity , day without cocaine exposure .</detailed_description>
