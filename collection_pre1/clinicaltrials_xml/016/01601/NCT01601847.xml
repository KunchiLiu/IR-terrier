	<brief_summary>The goal study identify vitamin D supplementation strategy best promotes lung , immune , overall health black infant bear preterm ( 28-36 week gestational age ) . This high risk population seem unique vitamin D need , inappropriate supplementation may promote wheeze allergy . The result study help form nutritional recommendation approximately 100,000 black infant bear 30-36 week gestational age U.S. every year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wheezing Black Preterm Infants : Impact Vitamin D Supplementation Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Black infant face high rate prematurity U.S. ( 18 % ) , high rate prematurity-associated wheezing illness , tend low vitamin D level . The goal [ comparative effectiveness ] study identify vit . D supplementation strategy minimize recurrent wheeze infancy . Long recognize important bone health , grow body evidence suggest vit . D may play role regulation development many organ system . The D pathway regulate lung inflammation impact morphogenesis , structure , cell growth survival bronchial smooth muscle . Vit . D exposure potential skew cytokine expression Th1 ( less allergic ) Th2 ( allergic ) phenotype . Due developmental immaturity , preterm infant may particularly vulnerable positive negative effect vit . D supplementation lung , airway , immune system . Our preliminary data , support literature , suggest overly aggressive vit . D supplementation may inadvertently increase wheeze infancy black , white , preterm infant ; however , vit . D deficiency could theoretically also increase wheeze via vulnerability respiratory pathogen . The propose study randomize clinical trial compare effect two different enteral vitamin D supplementation strategy recurrent wheeze infancy 300 black infant born preterm 28 0/7-36 6/7 wks gestational age , population neither vit . D requirement optimal vit . D serum level establish . The investigator test two strategy : ( I ) sustain supplementation 6 mo . age adjust prematurity , ( II ) cessation supplementation minimum dietary intake 200 IU/day reach . The specific aim characterize effect strategy ( aim 1 ) recurrent wheeze ( aim 2 ) allergic sensitization atopy . The investigator ( aim 3 ) explore relationship vit . D serum level recurrent wheezing . The investigator hypothesize strategy II effective promote pulmonary health minimize recurrent wheezing , allergic sensitization , overall healthcare utilization , sufficient prevent clinical vit . D deficiency . The investigator also hypothesize optimal vit . D serum level low norm population .</detailed_description>
