	<detailed_description>Colchicine supressor hepatic CYP1A2 theophylline sensitive CYP1A2 probe substrate . When two co-administered potential exists clinically significant drug interaction . This study aim determine effect steady-state colchicine pharmacokinetics theophylline administer single dose . After fast least 10 hour , thirty healthy , non-smoking , non-obese , non-pregnant adult volunteer age 18 45 give one dose 300mg ( 80mg/15ml concentrate ) theophylline ( theophylline elixir ) Day 1 . Fasting continue 4 hour dose . Blood sample draw participant dose 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics theophylline . Blood sample continue non-confined basis day 2-3 . A four day washout period complete theophylline dose Day 1 prior administration first colchicine dose Day 5 . Participants return clinic day 5-18 non-confined dosing colchicine ( 1x0.6mg twice daily every 12 hour ) . Administered dosing day necessarily fast state . Co-administration single 300mg dose theophylline ( 80mg/15ml ) colchicine ( 1x0.6mg ) occur morning Day 19 follow fast least 10 hour . Twelve hour later , subject receive last dose colchicine ( 1x0.6mg ) . Blood sample draw participant dose Day 19 24 hour post-dose confined basis time sufficient adequately determine pharmacokinetics theophylline . Blood sample continue non-confined basis day 20 21 . A goal study evaluate safety tolerability regimen healthy volunteer . Subjects monitor throughout participation study adverse reaction study drug and/or procedure . Seated blood pressure pulse measure prior dose approximately 1 , 2 , 3 hour follow drug administration Days 1 , 5 ( morning dose ) 19 . All adverse event whether elicited query , spontaneously report , observe clinic staff evaluate Investigator report subject 's case report form .</detailed_description>
