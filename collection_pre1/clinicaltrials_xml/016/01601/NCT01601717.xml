	<brief_title>RTI-336 Treatment Methamphetamine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine ( METH ) highly addictive stimulant acute exposure cause dopamine ( DA ) release stimulate midbrain reward center . The propose work represent important research effort considerable public health significance evaluate compound target specifically DA transporter ( DAT ) inhibition treatment METH dependence . The knowledge gain may ultimately support development implementation evidence-based treatment METH dependence , drug abuse problem tremendous public health impact . One therapeutic strategy develop test compound normalize ( increase ) DA determine treatment drug reduces METH use . A similar approach propose treatment cocaine dependence ( Howell Wilcox 2001 ; Mello Negus 1996 ) , another disorder associate abnormally low DA activity ( Martinez et al . 2007 ) . In effort identify DAT selective inhibitor , number 3-phenyltropane analog synthesize RTI International . Among , preclinical study show RTI-336 produce cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effect reduce cocaine self-administration rat , produce dose-dependent suppression cocaine self-administration rhesus monkey . RTI-336 recently receive IND-approval ( 75,778 ) preliminary safety test healthy male volunteer , schedule complete February 2009 . Subsequent effort , RTI-336 evaluate phase I trial involve cocaine-dependent volunteer . The current application put forth , first time , proposal evaluate preliminary efficacy promise candidate medication non-treatment-seeking METH-dependent volunteer .</detailed_description>

Potential participant exclude participation study follow apply : 1 . Have previous medically adverse reaction MA , include loss consciousness , chest pain , epileptic seizure . 2 . Have neurological psychiatric disorder , assess MINI , : episode major depression within past 2 year ; lifetime history schizophrenia , psychotic illness , bipolar illness ; current organic brain disease dementia assess clinical interview ; history current psychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult ; history suicide attempt within past three month and/or current suicidal ideation/plan ; history psychosis occur absence current METH use . 3 . Meet DSMIV criterion abuse/dependence alcohol drug , except nicotine marijuana . 4 . Have evidence clinically significant heart disease hypertension , determine physician . 5 .

Other female must either unable conceive ( i.e. , surgically sterilize , sterile , postmenopausal ) use reliable form contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , birth control pill , intrauterine device , condom , spermicide ) . All female must provide negative pregnancy urine test study entry , throughout study . 8 . Have history asthma , chronic cough wheezing , chronic respiratory illness . 9 . Currently use alpha beta agonist , theophylline , sympathomimetics . 10 . Have illness , condition , use medication , opinion PI and/or admit physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion study .</criteria>
