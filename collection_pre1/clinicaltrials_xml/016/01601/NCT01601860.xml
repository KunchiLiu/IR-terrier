	<detailed_description>Labor natural physiologic process trigger mechanical hormonal event promote uterine contraction . Several non-pharmacological resource use labor , relaxation technique ongoing support , maternal mobility , walking , breathe exercise , massage , Swiss ball , stool , shower , whirlpool application transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( ENT . ) Despite role physiotherapy labor establish practice public hospital , expect evidence benefit non-pharmacological resource time , manager health professional validate importance interdisciplinary care pregnancy - postpartum . The aim study evaluate effect resource non-pharmacological pain mother active phase cervical dilatation compare control . This research randomize , control clinical study include pregnant woman randomly assign two group : Intervention Group ( IG ) woman use follow sequence feature : ambulation ( cervical dilatation 4 5 cm ) , alternate stance associate ENT ( cervical dilatation 6 7 cm ) shower ( dilation &gt; 7 cm ) 40 minute resource ; Control Group ( CG ) woman use physical therapy resource , subject routine procedure maternity care . For pain assessment use Visual Analogue Scale - VAS body diagram location spatial distribution pain . Results present table graph make well understand comparison control intervention . To compare maternal morbidity , obstetric neonatal group use Fisher 's exact test chi-square .</detailed_description>
