	<brief_summary>COPD continue cause major morbidity patient . Those patient also respiratory failure obstructive sleep apnoea high risk exacerbation death bad health relate quality life similar COPD patient without respiratory failure . Treatment option group patient limit data support use machine assist breathe ( non-invasive ventilator ) stable patient limit . A major limitation device patient acceptance achieve sufficient control sleep breathe disturbance . Currently device set fixed pressure support breathe throughout night . The new software within trial device aim well match support provide machine need patient . It hop may offer enhanced comfort well superior control respiratory failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation AVAPS AE Algorithm Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Treatment option COPD patient consist medication , bronchodilator anti-inflammatory drug , pulmonary rehabilitation , long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) , lung volume reduction surgery lung transplantation . Studies show bronchodilator anti-inflammatory drug show minor benefit long term outcomes rather use mainly symptomatic relief.1 Pulmonary rehabilitation demonstrate improve functional status symptom lack evidence long term outcome therapy . 2 Lung volume reduction surgery lung transplantation appropriate small number patient ; therefore , demonstration improve long-term survival rate.3 , 4 Of available therapy , show significantly improve long term patient outcome . For severe COPD patient , LTOT treatment demonstrate prolonged survival control study . 5 , 6 But , despite effectiveness LTOT , COPD still characterize high morbidity mortality rate . Although treatment OSA CPAP therapy associate reduced hospital admission exacerbation possible adverse consequence pulmonary mechanic due exacerbate hyperinflation . Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) one therapy may prove beneficial stable COPD patient . NPPV use positive pressure ventilation administer via nasal full face mask ( cover nose mouth ) . This type ventilation become well establish increasingly use therapeutic option patient hypercapnic respiratory failure ( HRF ) due COPD.7 NPPV , use nocturnally , may improve nighttime hypoventilation common COPD patient . An improvement nocturnal hypoventilation would reset respiratory center sensitivity CO2.8 9 This would result improvement daytime gas exchange sleep quality . It also know hyperinflation patient COPD increase work breathing , thus fatigue respiratory muscles.10 It suggest apply nocturnal NPPV would allow respiratory muscle rest , result muscle function recovery , increase muscle strength , reduce tendency fatigue improvement pulmonary function gas exchange.11 AVAPS AE AVAPS AE mode therapy ( Philips Respironics Inc , Monroeville , PA , USA ) potential advantage currently establish mode noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( CPAP bilevel therapy ) . This mode therapy incorporate AVAPS ( automate adjustable IPAP set maintain target ventilation settable rate change ) , AutoEPAP Auto Back Rate . In particular automate EPAP algorithm ensure optimal upper airway patency without exacerbate hyperinflation . In study , evaluate AVAPS AE mode compare participant 's current mode ventilation . We believe automate parameter allow good nocturnal ventilatory control offset differ elastic resistive load impose change body position sleep . Furthermore , AVAPS AE counter change ventilatory requirement due alteration lung volume airway resistance different stage sleep . In summary , AVAPS AE mode enable automatic adjustment response ventilatory change throughout night . Study Objective The objective study validate performance AVAPS AE therapy COPD-OSA overlap patient nocturnal ventilation .</detailed_description>
