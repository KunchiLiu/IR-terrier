	<detailed_description>Secondary objective : phase I : collect preliminary result 6-month progression-free rate combination vismodegib + temozolomide PHASE II To estimate two study arm : - objective response rate ( Complete response + Partial Response accord WHO criterion ) 6 month treatment - duration treatment response - best overall response obtain study - progression-free survival ( PFS ) - time progression ( TTP ) - time treatment failure ( TTF ) - In combination arm ( vismodegib + temozolomide ) : evaluate safety combination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Patients must histologically confirm medulloblastoma ( include posterior fossa primitive neuroectodermal tumor ) know curative therapy exist Patients must recurrent refractory disease Patients must evidence measurable disease lesion preinclusion MRI . Patients measurable spinal disease eligible . NB : Patients complete resection recurrence eligible . Activation SHH pathway validate IHC . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Neutrophils ≥ 1 . 5 G/L Platelets ≥ 100 G /L Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( calculate CockcroftGault formula MDRD formula patient older 65 year ) serum creatinine within normal limit le 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN ALAT ASAT ≤ 2.5 ULN Serum albumin ≥ 25 g/L . Patients recover prior treatmentrelated toxicity ( persistent treatment related toxicity &lt; Grade 2 allow ( NCICTCAE v4.0 ) . Prior therapy : No prior hedgehog antagonist vismodegib antagonists hedgehog pathway , prior temozolomide treatment patient randomize Arm A B . Patients previously treat temozolomide eligible enrollment study arm C case case basis follow sponsor agreement More 4 week since prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas , 6 month high dose therapy ) immunotherapy At least 3 month since prior craniospinal irradiation ( ≥ 23 Gy ) At least 8 week since prior local irradiation primary tumor At least 2 week since prior focal irradiation symptomatic metastatic site . At least 1 week since prior colonystimulating factor ( e.g. , GCSF , GMCSF , erythropoietin ) Women childbearing potential* require negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior study treatment initiation ( i.e . Cycle 1 Day 1 ) . * : Female patient meet least one follow criterion define woman nonchildbearing potential : ≥50 year old naturally amenorrheic ≥ 1 year Permanent premature ovarian failure confirm specialist gynaecologist Previous bilateral salpingooophorectomy XY genotype , Turner 's syndrome , uterine agenesis Female patient meet least criterion define woman childbearing potential . An embryofetal development study rat confirm teratogenic potential vismodegib . Therefore , woman childbearing potential men must use two form effective contraception ( include one barrier method refer Appendix 4 acceptable method contraception ) least 4 week prior study entry , study period least 24 month posttreatment woman 2 month posttreatment men . Prior dispense vismodegib , investigator must confirm document patient 's use two contraceptive method , date negative pregnancy test , confirm patient 's understanding teratogenic potential vismodegib . Ability understand willingness comply followup visit . Covered medical insurance ( country applicable ) Tumor tissue sample available biological study ( initial diagnosis and/or relapse ) Pregnant breastfeed woman eligible . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical composition vismodegib . Any contraindication temozolomide treatment per Temodal® SPC ( see Appendix 5 ) . Patients malabsorption syndrome condition would interfere intestinal absorption . Patients must able swallow capsule . Uncontrolled hypocalcemia , hypomagnesemia , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , define less low limit normal despite adequate electrolyte supplementation . History congestive heart failure . History ventricular arrhythmia require medication . Congenital long QT syndrome . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( e.g. , serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , organ dysfunction ) would compromise patient 's ability tolerate study treatment would likely interfere study procedure result . Patients use prohibit concomitant and/or concurrent medication ( see section `` Prohibited concomitant/concurrent treatment . )</criteria>
