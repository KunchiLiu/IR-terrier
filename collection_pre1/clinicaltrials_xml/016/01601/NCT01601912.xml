	<brief_summary>The primary study aim unravel nature impair pain inhibition exercise patient chronic Whiplash-Associated Disorders ( WAD ) . This ascertain examine whether activation serotonergic and/or noradrenergic descending pathway improve pain inhibition exercise patient . In addition , aim examine whether activation serotonergic and/or noradrenergic descending pathway prevent post-exertional malaise follow submaximal exercise chronic WAD patient . A secondary study aim comprise examine effect acute submaximal exercise without activation serotonergic noradrenergic descending pathway chronic WAD patient ' cognitive performance . Furthermore , isolated effect activate serotonergic noradrenergic descending pathway chronic WAD patient ' cognitive performance study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unraveling Nature Impaired Pain Inhibition Patients With Chronic Whiplash-associated Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Whiplash-Associated Disorders ( WAD ) debilitating , costly condition , remain challenge clinician , include physician , rehabilitation specialist physiotherapist . There consistent evidence central sensitization people chronic WAD . In previous study chronic WAD patient , group show pain inhibition exercise impair submaximal exercise trigger severe relapse name post-exertional malaise . On hand , imbalance serotonin ( 5-HT ) norepinephrine ( NE ) likely responsible malfunction pain inhibitory pathway . Indeed , NE require activation descend noradrenergic pathway establish nociceptive inhibitory property . Serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug activate serotonergic descending pathway recruit , part , opioid peptide-containing interneurons dorsal horn . It become clear lack pain inhibition account part various symptom rest follow exercise particular ( post-exertional malaise ) . However , mechanism behind lack pain inhibition exercise remain reveal . Besides lack endogenous pain inhibition exercise people chronic WAD , appear sufficient evidence support presence impair cognitive function chronic pain patient general preliminary evidence chronic WAD patient particular . The present study aim examine whether activation serotonergic and/or noradrenergic descending pathway improve pain inhibition exercise chronic WAD patient . In addition , aim examine whether activation serotonergic and/or noradrenergic descending pathway prevent post-exertional malaise follow submaximal exercise patient . A secondary study aim comprise examine effect acute submaximal exercise without activation serotonergic noradrenergic descending pathway chronic WAD patient ' cognitive performance . Furthermore , isolated effect activate serotonergic noradrenergic descending pathway chronic WAD patient ' cognitive performance studied.We modulate endogenous serotonergic adrenergic pain inhibitory mechanism use selective NE reuptake inhibitor ( NRI ) selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) . Endogenous pain inhibition cognitive function ( sustain selective attention , executive function ) study rest response exercise ( 1 ) baseline condition , ( 2 ) intake NRI ( Atomoxetine ) , ( 3 ) intake SSRI ( Citalopram ) .</detailed_description>
