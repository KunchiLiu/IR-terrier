	<brief_summary>The study aim examine effect alkalinisation NaCl ( sodium chloride , salt ) -rich diet acid base status , bone metabolism , protein turnover influenced physiological system . Due increase urinary calcium excretion bone resorption high NaCl-intake consider risk factor osteoporosis . On contrary alkaline diet know beneficial influence bone metabolism . Therefore investigator hypothesize alkaline diet reduce NaCl-induced bone resorption . 8 healthy male volunteer take part stationary study carry metabolic ward German Aerospace Center . The study consist 2 campaign , last 16 day . Both campaign divide 5 day adaptation , 10 day intervention 1.5 day stationary recovery . During intervention period volunteer diet NaCl-rich ( 7.7 mmol Na/kg body weight/day ) supplement one campaign 90 mmol potassium bicarbonate ( KHCO3 ) randomize cross-over design . The campaign serve control . Bone metabolism study bone formation marker fast morning blood 24h-urinary bone resorption marker . Acid base status assess blood gas analysis fast postprandial state well urinary marker . Protein turnover study stable isotope . Further physiological system like energy metabolism cardiovascular system also investigation .</brief_summary>
