	<brief_summary>S. mutans count find high woman high level untreated caries . In Pakistan 95 % carious lesion untreated alarm situation . A majority mother 's high level caries pose increase risk vertically transmit child . Therefore , aim study determine effect A Traumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) reduce S. mutans count pregnant woman indirectly reduce vertical transmission S. mutans child ART preventive program may provide promoted periurban area lack accessibility oral health care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental caries multifactorial bacterial disease significant public health problem many countries.Microbiological molecular study show increase chance caries development pregnant women.The reason Pregnancy condition involve many physical physiological change may lead many temporary adaptive change body structure . This occur due release number hormone estrogen , progesterone , relaxin gonadotropin . Studies use phenotyping genotyping technique strongly propose mother primary source infection child carry S. mutans strain saliva main source S. mutans transfer.The rate degree transmission depend degree infection parent , caretaker playmate , frequency contact infant his/her diet immune status.Recent study show infant get colonize S. mutans mother eruption primary teeth . Hames et al ( 2006 ) find positive correlation infect child parent high S. mutans count.It find parent high level S. mutans saliva source transmission S. mutans child conclude several preventive program could beneficial prevent vertical transmission mother infant . Studies also show preventive care measure pregnant woman mother young child lead reduction S. mutans level subsequent decrease colonization microorganism caries development.Recent research work also report preventive program apply pregnant woman reduce amount plaque S. mutans colonization thus positive effect . There interventional study determine effect oral environment stabilization ( OES ) procedure S. mutans count pregnant woman ART . Volpato et al ( 2011 ) find decrease S. mutans colony form unit count , statistically significant difference ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , pregnant woman 's saliva sample OES.And conclude OES effective clinical procedure diminish number Streptococcus mutans colony form unit saliva high-caries risk pregnant woman . This management simple effective , equivalent basic treatment need pregnant woman look dental care public service .</detailed_description>
