	<detailed_description>This study randomize control trial compare radiologist confidence face intravenously enhance study without oral contrast . At time make appointment , clerk ask patient he/she wish participate research study impact oral contrast . If patient assent , he/she receive phone call research assistant obtain informed consent . The first ten patient call office schedule scan use 64 slice MDCT recruit randomized consent . Subjects randomized time recruitment , he/she call make appointment exam , 1:1 ratio control arm ( contrast ) experimental arm ( contrast ) . The control arm either pick two bottle oral contrast radiology office bottle mail currently standard . They drink oral contrast two hour study . They also ingest 300 mL water immediately prior imaging administer standard intravenous contrast dose . The experimental group mail give oral contrast . They arrive appointment ingest 300 mL water immediately prior exam well standard intravenous contrast dose scan . This design eliminate need repeat scan patient , thus decrease radiation dose . A patient satisfaction survey give patient follow exam hand technologist</detailed_description>
