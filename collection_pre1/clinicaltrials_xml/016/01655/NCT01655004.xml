	<brief_summary>Aromatase inhibitor lead significant improvement clinical outcome woman postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer . However , notable absence phase III comparison among three agent therefore clear indication superiority one AI others . Furthermore , remain distinct lack predictive biomarkers AI efficacy toxicity inform clinical decision . The metabolic pathway exemestane recently delineate UGT2B17 active hepatic gluconoryltransferase responsible glucuronidation crucial active exemestane metabolite , 17-dihydroxyexemestane . The UGT2B17*2/*2 deletion genotype associate markedly reduce glucuronidation 17-dihydroxyexemestane vitro find commonly Asians Caucasians ( 60-70 % v le 10 % ) . Our research group recently demonstrate significant reduction glucuronidation vorinostat , UGT2B17 substrate , trend towards improve clinical benefit rate progression-free survival Asian breast cancer patient UGT2B17*2 homozygote treat compound . In-vivo study correlate UGT2B17*2 genotype exemestane pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics lack . We hypothesize individual UGT2B17*2/*2 genotype reduce glucuronidation 17-dihydroxyexemestane therefore increase exposure active drug , result improve treatment efficacy . We propose study exemestane hormone receptor positive post-menopausal advance breast cancer patient prospective correlation treatment outcome UGT2B17 genotype . The primary endpoint correlation genotype ( UGT2B17*2/*2 vs least one wild-type variant ) clinical benefit rate , secondary endpoint include association exemestane pharmacokinetics , progression-free survival , overall survival musculoskeletal toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective non-randomised open-label study exemestane post-menopausal , hormone receptor positive advance breast cancer patient , pre-specified analysis exemestane pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics accord UGT2B17 genotype ( UGT2B17*2/*2 versus least one wild-type allele ) . A total 110 patient enrolled period 30 month . Eligible patient receive exemestane 25mg daily orally ( part standard care ) progression disease intolerable toxicity . At time study entry , blood sample draw genotyping study ( research purpose ) investigator blind result . Pharmacokinetic sample exemestane metabolite perform baseline day 29 ( +/- 3 day ) dose 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour exemestane ingestion . Patients evaluate 8-weekly basis toxicity efficacy assessment first 6 month treatment , follow 12-weekly thereafter disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal .</detailed_description>
