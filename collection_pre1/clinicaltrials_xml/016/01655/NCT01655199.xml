	<brief_summary>During previous phase project ( Phase I II ) , two new field test design validated integration primary care set Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . These new field test 3-min paced-walk test ( 3MPWT ) 3-min paced step test ( 3MPST ) . If validity sensitivity TM3 could highlight , particularly reduction dyspnea level follow bronchodilatation , Phase II highlight 3MPST allow detect decrease dyspnea bronchodilatation . The use high step rate could explain result hypothesis relative neuromechanical coupling dyspnea . The main objective trial follow investigation sensitivity 3MPST detect effect pharmacological intervention exertional dyspnea COPD patient . The hypothesis work use low step rate cadence could allow detect improvement exertional dyspnea follow treatment-induced bronchodilatation , contrary high step rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity Step Test Detect Improvement Dyspnea Following Bronchodilation Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For project , 40 patient COPD recruit 2 centre ( Institute Cardiology Pneumology Quebec Chest Institute Montreal ) . For patient , three visit perform . During first visit , baseline pulmonary function maximal exercise capacity evaluate patient familiarized step test proceeding . Between different visit , 3-7 day period respect . During second third visit , 4 step test perform 4 different rate , follow one two condition ( placebo bronchodilatation ) . This project propose two randomization level . The first randomization relative choice condition use second visit ( placebo ou bronchodilatation ) second one rate order ( 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 steps/min ) . During performed exercise , cardiorespiratory pulmonary parameter measure use portable system .</detailed_description>
