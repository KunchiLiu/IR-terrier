	<brief_summary>This study compare pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile sublingual CRLS035 ( two dos ) I.V flumazenil administration . Selection study drug dosage : CRLS035 - sublingual Flumazenil administrate final dosage 1.1 mg per 100 µl 2.2 mg ( 200 µl ) sublingual spray administration . Currently , Flumazenil give IV drug repetitive administration dose 0.2 mg 3 mg per hour . As bioavailability Flumazenil expect low IV administration , 1.1 mg 2.2 mg test sublingual delivery . The suggested dos study safe accord follow data : first , sublingual buccal administration Flumazenil detail previously similar high dos side effect , secondly , IV dose may reach 3 mg thirdly , oral administration report 600 mg/dose . The purpose study determine single dose PK profile SL CRLS035 . This study design collect short-term safety data monitor PK profile CRLS035 . Primary Objective The primary objective determine single dose safety PK profile SL CRLS035 use market IV flumazenil formulation comparator . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective ( 1 ) characterize concentration time course two dose level SL CRLS035 support dose selection Phase 2 3 study evaluate safety tolerability flumazenil formulation ; ( 2 ) To evaluate effect high fat diet water consumption PK profile .</brief_summary>
