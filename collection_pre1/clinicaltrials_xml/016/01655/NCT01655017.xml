	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue ( AT ) specific alteration obesity could link obesity comorbidities . In particular increase fibrosis abundance AT observe obese compare lean subject . The investigator previously observe amount fibrosis AT measure baseline could predict surgery-induced weight loss . Patient high amount fibrosis baseline lose less fat mass one year surgery . To date fibrosis measure use immunohistochemistry surgical biopsy . To prospect , non invasive tool need validate , particular device able measure adipose tissue stiffness . The investigator hypothesis new device powerful IHC-quantified fibrosis predict surgery induce weight loss . To answer question investigator evaluate adipose tissue stiffness device well quantify fibrosis use immuno-chemistry AT biopsy morbidly obese patient first year bariatric surgery . The first objective validate investigator new device compare invasive fibrosis measurement adipose tissue non invasive stiffness measure The investigator second objective ass whether investigator device predict weight loss repose bariatric surgery . This project base clinical protocol perform massively obese subject ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m² BMI &gt; 35kg/m² comorbidities ) . The investigator recruit 250 obese patient address bariatric surgery ( bypass , sleeve gastric banding ) . Clinical phenotype , biochemical analysis , body composition , systemic inflammation , adipose tissue biopsy ( evaluate inflammation fibrosis ) assess baseline 3 12 month surgery . Also baseline surgical sub cutaneous omental adipose tissue ( evaluate inflammation fibrosis ) well liver biopsy ( score non alcoholic hepatitis ) analyse . 50 non obese patient serve control . Adipose tissue stiffness measure device well fibrosis quantification subcutaneous omental adipose tissue assess baseline program non inflammatory abdominal surgery Associations clinical biological parameter assess different point follow . More generally , project might lead u elucidate whether fibrosis adipose tissue predict surgery outcome term weight loss obesity relate complication improvement . Also investigator want validate new non invasive tool measure adipose tissue fibrosis check whether predict surgery outcomes .</detailed_description>
