	<criteria>1 . The subject must diagnosis pain due LSR , follow characteristic : The subject perceive pain one low limb site consistent area innervate L4 , L5 , S1 nerve root , without sensory symptom affect area ( typically , pain may perceive buttock , thigh , calf , leg , foot , toe ) . The history pain suggest cause LSR due injury lumbosacral nerve root ( ) degenerative disease vertebrae lumbosacral spine associate soft tissue ( include intervertebral disc ) . The duration pain since onset ≥ 12 week . Based clinical history , intensity pain stable 2week period screening . 2 . In investigator 's opinion , subject 's diagnosis LSR support follow screening : Based StEP instrument : Neurological examination lower limb show impair muscle power , sensory function , deep tendon reflex territory affect nerve root . Pain/sensory disturbance dermatomal/myotomal distribution precipitate exacerbated straight leg raise ( straightlegraising test perform specified StEP ) . The total StEP score ≥ 4 ( indicative LSR cause pain ) 4 . At screening , subject average daily pain score neuropathic pain due LSR ≥ 3 ≤ 8 PINRS . 5 . If female , subject must postmenopausal ( defined menstruation least 12 month ) , surgically sterilize ≥3 month screen visit , agree use 2 reliable method contraception ( oral , implantable , transdermal , injectable contraceptive conjunction intrauterine device barrier method ) 6week treatment period , 6 week posttreatment followup period , additional 8 week last study visit ( Week 12 , Visit 9 ) avoid pregnancy childbearing potential ( define biologically capable become pregnant ) . If male , subject must agree use condom 6week treatment period study drug , 6week posttreatment follow period , additional 8 week last study visit ( Week 12 , Visit 9 ) . 1 . The subject : Neuropathic pain due cause specify inclusion criterion ( e.g. , postherpetic neuralgia ; painful diabetic neuropathy ; mononeuritis multiplex ; central poststroke pain ; fail back surgery relation present episode radiculopathy ; spinal abscess , infection , hematoma , malignancy ; phantom limb pain ; peripheral neuropathy due alcoholism , malignancy , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] , syphilis ; drug abuse ; vitamin B12 deficiency ; hypothyroidism ; liver disease ; toxic exposure ) . Pain associate substantial somatic pain component ( e.g. , nonneuropathic/musculoskeletal pain lower limb part body apart back ) one cause potential cause pain symptom . Any painful concurrent rheumatic disease , limited , fibromyalgia , rheumatoid arthritis , significant osteoarthritis . Any question regard acceptability etiology neuropathic pain discuss Zalicus medical monitor . 2 . In investigator 's opinion , subject unable reliably delineate ass pain anatomical location/distribution ( e.g. , subject reliably tell difference back pain lower limb pain rate intensity separately ) . 3 . The subject pain low limb solely upon walk rest . 4 . The subject undergone surgery LSR within last 6 month receive treatment epidural injection , nerve block , acupuncture LSR within 4 week screen . 5 . The subject : A history seizure , exclude pediatric febrile seizure , currently seizures A history current diagnosis schizophrenia bipolar disorder Had stroke TIA ≤ 6 month screen visit Has episode major depression generalize anxiety disorder ≤ 6 month screen visit . 6 . The subject history currently follow condition , investigator 's opinion , may interfere study procedure compromise subject 's safety : Cardiovascular disease Gastrointestinal disease Hepatic disease Respiratory disease Renal disease Any condition know interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug 7 . The subject history currently : Any clinically significant vital sign , ECG , laboratory abnormality . QTcF &gt; 450 msec ( male ) &gt; 470 msec ( female ) 8 . The subject malignancy . 9 . The subject positive test HIV antibody history HIV . 10 . The subject positive test hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C antibody . 11 . The subject history AST , ALT bilirubine &gt; 2 time upper limit normal . 12 . The subject history hypersensitivity calcium channel blocker . 13 . The subject history multiple drug allergy ( ≥ 2 kind ) , investigator 's opinion , may place great risk participation study . 14 . The subject participate previous clinical study Z160 receive another investigational drug ≤ 30 day screen visit . 15 . The subject take prohibited medication ≤ 30 day screen visit . 16 . The subject history alcohol narcotic substance abuse , define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSMIV ) , ≤ 1 year screen visit . 17 . The subject positive urine drug test screening . 18 . The subject female pregnant breastfeeding time screen visit plan become pregnant study period .</criteria>
