	<detailed_description>Cognitive dysfunction Fibromyalgia patient : specific neuro-psychological dysfunction , psychiatric comorbidity integrative assessment - Can investigator help ? Scientific Technological Background 1 . General Clinical characteristic FM common rheumatologic disorder ( range 2 % -12 % general population ) complex symptom presentation include : chronically painful , soft tissue pain . Those affected suffer widespread pain tenderness anatomically define tender point soft tissue musculoskeletal structure . Associated symptom include depression , anxiety , fatigue , sleep disturbance , somatic complaint ( headache , irritable bowel bladder , morning stiffness , dysesthesia ) severe cognitive impairment . Cognitive impairment FM subjective element : `` forgetfulness '' , `` concentration difficulty '' `` fail memory '' . 2 . Cognitive impairment FM 2.1 Subjective Cognitive impairment FM The subjective cognitive impairment describe several study . Zachrisson colleague report 95 % incidence rate `` Concentration Difficulties '' 93 % incidence rate `` Failing Memory '' Fibro-Fatigue scale . Additionally , patient FM report cognitive problem dissociative state rheumatology patient . Arnold colleague report result patient focus group assess important symptom impact symptoms patient perspective . Patients report memory concentration problem disruptiveâ€”affecting ability express due word-finding difficulty , ability organize plan ahead , ability respond quickly question , ability drive . 2.2 Objective Cognitive impairment FM Objective cognitive dysfunction assess broad range neuro-cognitive testing . The mechanism find marked impairment FM : working memory , follow episodic memory access semantic memory . In addition finding point particular difficulty deal distract information patient enhance sensitivity distraction difficulty filter sensory stimulus . 2.2.1 Working memory Working memory system short-term memory storage system ( order second ) combine mental process , allow example , briefly remember two number add together mentally . A quick assessment work memory function : many digit individual listen repeat backward order . Working memory basic cognitive mechanism underlies successful performance many cognitive task . There several study report impairment important cognitive function subject FM , use variety different test work memory . ( A ) Paced auditory serial attention test ( PASAT ) : Most study use PASAT find low performance subject FM compare control although Suhr find difference . ( B ) Auditory Consonant Trigram ( ACT ) test : Both Leavitt Katz Dick colleague find subject FM recall few trigram correctly , many perform impaired range compare control participant . ( C ) Reading Span Task work memory test use extensively study age-related decline work memory : Park colleague Dick colleague find subject FM perform poorly age-matched control . Furthermore , Park colleague find performance subject FM different control subject 20 year old . ( D ) Test Everyday Attention ( TEA ) show subject FM low score work memory component TEA . The wide variety work memory test demonstrate low performance FM striking , suggest impairment quite robust . Because deficit work memory ability repercussive effect aspects cognition , small deficit work memory may large impact performance complex task . A busy work environment require employee hold information mind use information processing . 2.2.2 Episodic Memory Episodic memory refers specifically ability remember specific event episodes one 's life ( Remembering first day school name teacher ) . Several researcher find deficit episodic memory subject FM use wide variety standardize neuro-psychological test laboratory test . Several result present : ( A ) Grace colleague find significant difference general memory , verbal memory , delay recall component Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised ( WMS-R ) , visual memory attention/concentration component . ( B ) Leavitt Katz find subject FM , perform slightly norm logical memory pair associate . ( C ) Glass colleague find subject FM recall few word list learn task , memory impair combined distract secondary task list learn recall . These finding suggest mild impairment episodic memory FM patient . However , result episodic memory test seem robust work memory result . In addition , Leavitt Katz suggest memory function FM may strong enough perform well ideal condition ( neuro-cognitive testing ) , performance decrement may observe presence distraction . 2.2.3 Semantic memory Semantic memory knowledge word fact learn , know egg milk source protein ( 21 ) . It measure number way . One method use verbal fluency measure quickly efficiently store knowledge word access . Several study indicate impairment verbal fluency FM . ( A ) Park colleague find FM subject produce few word fluency test compare age-matched control . ( B ) Landro colleague Munguia-Izquierdo Legaz-Arrese ) also report similar finding . ( C ) Suhr find difference subject FM control fluency test . ( D ) Park colleague Glass colleague also find FM subject perform poorly education- matched control test vocabulary ( another test semantic memory ) . ( E ) Leavitt Katz report name speed deficit FM , consistent verbal fluency result . Thus , patient FM seem deficit accessing store knowledge . This deficit make difficult patient think quickly come right word give situation . Several patient indicate kind word-finding difficulty interview patient focus group . 2.2.4 Attention , concentration executive function Attention work memory closely link attention mechanism use control item access , store processed working memory . The work memory problem find FM patient may due management content work memory , use attention concentration . ( A ) Leavitt Katz suggest cognitive impairment FM patient prominent task distraction compete source information prominent ( PASAT , ACT ) contrast task without distraction ( digit span , logical memory , paired associate ) . ( B ) Others find distraction reduce memory ability FM subject attention divide learning . ( C ) Dick colleague report FM subject perform low level healthy control TEA test attention . ( D ) In recent study perform Verdejo-Garcia colleague , executive function decision making assessed FM use Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ) Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) . FM subject achieve low number category make non-perseverative error WCST . On IGT , subject FM show altered learning curve suggest hypersensitivity reward . These new data executive function fit well attention control difficulty . Dealing distraction control attend , particular problem FM come category executive function . Planning goal-directed behavior monitoring also category . Taken together , result strongly suggest executive function impaired FM patient . 3 . Possible cause cognitive dysfunction FM 3.1 Other mental symptom Mental symptom depression anxiety suspect play important role development cognitive dysfunction FM . Sephton et al find depressive symptom negatively correlate verbal recall Surh find related memory . Grace et al report association anxiety measure memory concentration . An important question whether dysfunction remain correct depression anxiety . Indeed , Dick et al report significant difference control FM patient even correct depression anxiety . Park et al Verdejo-Garcia et al find significant correlation mental symptom performance cognitive measure . In summary , depressive symptom anxiety contribute cognitive dysfunction entirely explain . 3.2 Fatigue sleep disturbance Impaired sleep know negatively affect cognitive performance . Cote -Moldofsky Suhr attempt explain possible relationship alter sleep architecture cognitive performance . Suhr specifically report fatigue related psychomotor speed . Dick et al report difference control FM patient remain even control sleep disturbance . Thus , case mental symptom , fatigue sleep disturbance fully explain cognitive deficit FM patient . 3.3 Pain Chronic pain know negatively affect cognitive performance . Various cognitive task include , impaired attention , impaired learn decision-making task attentional bias pain-related stimulus , find chronic pain patient FM patient specifically . These patient find selectively attend pain word . In many study FM patient specifically , self-reported level pain associated cognitive performance . These suggest pain may disrupt normal function attention . As apposed case depression , anxiety sleep disturbance , Dick et al , observed difference control FM patient cognitive function disappear controlled pain . 4 . Recent experience psychiatric clinic Over past month investigator evaluate FM patient cognitive dysfunction . Nearly 10 patient undergone mention extensive assessment . In assessment investigator also add specific assessment executive function ; `` six element '' task . This task direct participant perform several task time limitation specific rule . Thus , require use : planning organization , initiation , monitoring . These process usually take consideration formal neuro-psychological test structure nature . Our preliminary finding suggest fibromyalgia patient show pattern executive dysfunction compare healthy population . The investigator hypothesize similar pattern find extensive research suggest significant executive dysfunction lie basis cognitive dysfunction find fibromyalgia patient . 5 . Cognitive rehabilitation - Treatment option Cognitive rehabilitation , behavioral treatment approach individual cognitive dysfunction , design reduce functional impairment increase engagement daily adaptive activity ; vocational , social , adaptive daily living skill . Originally develop improve cognitive functioning traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , cognitive rehabilitation program recently adapt neurological condition . Subsets cognitive training program develop target improvement specific cognitive domain include : attention , work memory , executive functioning , essential cognitive skill complete daily living task . For example , TBI patient ' underwent attention training , consist direct attention metacognitive training promote development compensatory problem solve strategy , show improvement complex attention measure . When come mild memory impairment , compensatory strategy recommend . Adults chronic TBI , train use compensatory strategy personally-relevant memory problem errorless learn didactic strategy instruction , report great use strategy train . Metacognitive training ( self monitoring self regulation ) executive function include problem solve strategy application everyday activity . The awareness training protocol incorporate feedback increase participant ' awareness ability , experiential exercise require participant predict , self-monitor , self-evaluate performance . Improvement awareness , performance everyday task overall function evident TBI stroke patient . Cognitive decline executive dysfunction also common among Parkinson 's disease patient . As FM , executive dysfunction/attention memory impairment prevalent deficit report . A computerized cognitive rehabilitation program focus improve attention , abstract reasoning , visuospatial ability show PD patient significantly improve verbal fluency , immediate delay logical memory , visuospatial reasoning compare baseline assessment ; gain maintain 6 month . Improvement measure executive skill show complete intervention consist in-person training practice exercise worksheet attention task . Daily at-home practice exercise also encourage . Similar cognitive impairment also common among multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient , report mainly attention memory complaint . In double-blinded , randomize , placebo control trial intervention improve learn memory , MS patient teach use modify `` story memory technique '' use context imagery improve learning , therefore , recall . Participants moderate severe learning impairment show significant improvement learn ability . The use modify story memory technique recommend practice guideline remediation learn memory MS patient . In summary : Altogether , report demonstrate quite conclusively salience cognitive dysfunction impact daily life patient FM . Comorbid symptom ( depression , anxiety , fatigue disturb sleep ) negatively impact cognitive function , fully explain finding . In one study , pain robust effect cognitive function could explain dysfunction find FM . There need ass cognitive function FM along possible comorbid symptom . Based preliminary finding also need broaden assessment executive function . In addition , cognitive rehabilitation prove successful variety condition involve cognitive impairment . One may suggest specific cognitive impairment pattern identify FM patient , cognitive rehabilitation plan tailor fit patient ' need . Research Objectives The object propose research perform : 1 . A broad neuro-cognitive test battery large population Fibromyalgia patient . Previous test fully evaluate executive function ; therefore investigator add specific test function . 2 . A broad assessment Axis I psychiatric co-morbidity FM population . 3 . A broad assessment FM additional symptom : depressive symptom , anxiety , fatigue , pain , sleep disturbance . 4 . An attempt identify `` pure '' cognitive deficit unique FM patient directly attribute FM . Therefore , possible correlation neuro-cognitive impairment , Axis I psychiatric diagnosis , additional FM symptom motivation level perform data analyze control confounders . 5 . Develop cognitive rehabilitation program base cognitive dysfunction investigator discover study . 6 . Based cognitive dysfunction investigator discover study investigator hope compile short neuro-cognitive battery clinical use FM patient . - Research Plan________________________________ A . Methodology plan operation A.1 Overview This open study large number fibromyalgia patient undergo extensive neuro-cognitive assessment . All consent participant assess use well validate neuro-cognitive test . Current Axis I , psychiatric comorbidity assess use well validate questionnaire . Finally , symptom associate FM also assess ( depression , anxiety , fatigue , sleep pain ) appropriate rating scale . This assessment perform trained neuro-psychologist take place psychiatric clinic two consecutive session . A.2 Patient selection A.2.1 Inclusion criteria 1 . Primary fibromyalgia define American College Rheumatology 2 . Age 18-70 year 3 . Male female 4 . Competent willing give write informed consent 4.A.2.2 Exclusion Criteria 1 . History head trauma 2 . Any significant neurological disorder may confound neuro-cognitive test A.3 Sample size The investigator plan recruit 100 fibromyalgia patient period 18 month . This exceptionally large number patient . It large enough fully assess neuro-cognitive dysfunction FM patient control psychiatric symptom additional FM symptom . A.4 Assessment patient A.4.1 Neuro-cognitive test 1 . Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS III - relevant subtests Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III 2 .

The analysis data take 6 month . C. Expected result The investigator expect find extensive specific pattern cognitive dysfunction FM patient , compare norm find healthy population . The investigator expect find cognitive dysfunction field : working memory , episodic memory , semantic memory . The investigator expand assessment include executive function expect find significant dysfunction area . The investigator expect find psychological factor depression anxiety additional FM symptom pain fatigue . The investigator mean control symptom order expose `` pure '' cognitive dysfunction characteristic FM , explain active symptom . D. Significance FM common disable disorder many complex symptom . Evidence continue mount cognitive dysfunction real trouble symptom work memory , episodic memory semantic memory mostly affect . In addition , FM patient seem particularly sensitive distraction preliminary data appear specifically executive dysfunction . This study aim broadly assess neuro-cognitive function FM patient possible neuro-cognitive deficit specific focus executive function . Since Axis I psychiatric disorder , mental symptom ( depression anxiety ) additional FM symptom ( fatigue , pain sleep disturbance ) may affect cognitive function , investigator also assess factor . In analysis expect data investigator `` control '' possible confounders hope find unique neuro-cognitive dysfunction pattern specific FM patient . The investigator intend compile shorter , `` user friendly '' , neuro-cognitive battery , may serve clinician routine assessment FM patient . The investigator aim develop cognitive rehabilitation program specifically address cognitive dysfunction investigator expect discover study . Munguia-Izquierdo Lagaz-Arrese find aquatic therapy ( exercise warm water ) indirectly improve many symptom FM , include cognitive function . Leavitt Katz find rehearsal help subject FM overcome effect distraction memory test . Based study , extensive knowledge cognitive rehabilitation program clinical state , investigator determine develop cognitive rehabilitation program supplement pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention FM patient . By investigator offer unique novel intervention Fm patient .</detailed_description>
