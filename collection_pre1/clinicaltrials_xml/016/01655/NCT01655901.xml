	<brief_summary>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM : Video game enormous mass appeal , omnipresent daily schedule child youth link obesity epidemic . The investigator research group recently report sedentary video game playing increase food intake adolescent . Interestingly , overconsumption food associate seat video game play observe without increased sensation hunger appetite , previously observe television view . Active video game offer appeal opportunity increase energy expenditure promote healthy body weight among child youth might otherwise spending time sedentary screen-based activity . However , significant increase energy expenditure result active video game play might little importance energy balance one compensate increase energy intake and/or decrease physical activity . Studies date fail measure energy intake currently unknown effect active video game daily energy balance . OBJECTIVE : The main aim study examine acute effect play active video game energy intake expenditure . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator hypothesize increase energy expenditure promote active video game offset compensatory adjustment food intake spontaneous physical activity subsequent intervention . RESEARCH PLAN : With use randomize crossover design , 30 normal-weight 30 obese adolescent 13 17 year age complete three 1-hour experimental condition , namely ( 1 ) rest sit position ( control condition ) , ( 2 ) playing Xbox 360 ( sedentary video game condition ) ( 3 ) playing Kinect ( active video game condition ) , follow ad libitum lunch . The primary outcome acute ( 24-h ) short-term ( 3-day ) energy intake expenditure . Food intake measure use ad libitum test meal immediately follow intervention , food menu remainder day dietary record subsequent 3-day period . Energy expenditure measure use indirect calorimetry intervention Actical accelerometer subsequent 3-day period . Secondary outcome include appetite sensation ( visual analogue scale ) , stress marker ( heart rate variability , blood pressure , mental workload ) , level appetite-related hormone substrate ( glucose , insulin , cortisol , leptin , ghrelin ) . RELEVANCE : The present study innovative likely result number new important finding inform future recommendation . If investigator confirm hypothesis , clinical implication rethink strategy promote active video game intervention tool prevention overweight obesity youth .</brief_summary>
