	<brief_summary>The purpose study find recommended dose level schedule dose LY3023414 safely take participant advanced metastatic cancer . The study also explore change various marker blood cell potentially tumor cell . Finally , study help document antitumor activity drug may . In Part A study , participant advanced/metastatic cancer ( include lymphoma ) receive increase dos LY3023414 . In Part B , LY3023414 explore different type cancer , include breast lung cancer , lymphoma mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
