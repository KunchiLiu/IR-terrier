	<brief_summary>The first technology call high dose rate brachytherapy . Brachytherapy sometimes call internal radiation therapy . High dose rate brachytherapy procedure involve temporarily place radioactive material inside patient 's body 10-20 minute . Then , remainder radiation treatment give 3 week period use stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . SBRT novel treatment modality involve delivery high individual dos radiation tumor high precision . This allow doctor deliver amount radiation much short time . The purpose study determine safety brachytherapy combine hypofractionated SBRT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common non cutaneous malignancy diagnose United States . Men newly diagnose disease currently stratify base PSA , Gleason score , DRE one three group : low risk , intermediate risk , high risk . Low risk define either Gleason score 6 , PSA &lt; 10 , T1-T2a . Intermediate risk define T2b-T2c Gleason score 7 PSA 10-20 ng/ml . High-risk disease define PSA &gt; 20 Gleason &gt; 7 T2c great . The current standard non-surgical treatment men intermediate risk prostate cancer radiation therapy . Recently , multiple phase III trial demonstrate benefit radiation dose escalation treatment low risk , intermediate risk , high risk prostate cancer . These trial use external beam radiation therapy set new standard dose radiation treatment men prostate cancer endorse NCCN . In addition increase total dose deliver EBRT , dose escalation achieve use brachytherapy . The radiation deliver either low activity radioactive seed source ( term low dose rate LDR brachytherapy ) use temporary implant high activity source ( high dose rate HDR brachytherapy ) . HDR brachytherapy standard care United States Europe deliver radiation boost prostate combine external beam radiation . Three large study include 500 men receive combination EBRT HDR . All report excellent outcome PSA progression free survival 70-90 % men intermediate high-risk disease . Further , rate late GI/GU toxicity quite low well late grade 3 GU toxicity range 2.1-6.7 % , late grade 4 GU toxicity 0-1 % , late grade 3 GI toxicity 0-1 % late grade 4 GI toxicity 0-0.5 % . In addition , phase III randomize trial compare EBRT alone EBRT combine HDR boost . This trial demonstrate significant improvement actuarial biochemical relapse-free survival see favor combine brachytherapy schedule . However , trial criticize EBRT alone arm low biologic radiation dose combine arm . A retrospective study Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center compare patient receive EBRT alone 86.4 Gy underwent HDR brachytherapy combine EBRT . Dose escalation add HDR brachytherapy provide improved PSA relapse-free survival treatment prostate cancer compare ultra-high-dose EBRT , independent risk group multivariate analysis , significant benefit intermediate-risk patient . Finally , systemic review literature compare result EBRT alone , EBRT combine LDR , EBRT combine HDR . This study conclude combination external beam radiotherapy HDR brachytherapy result superior biochemical control overall survival . Radiation effect prostate cancer cell typically study use clonogenic cell survival curve , allow cell death model use linear quadratic equation . The dose response tumor normal tissue fractionate radiation therapy predict accord formula : S= e^ ( -D-D2 ) , linear quadratic component model . Based upon model , alpha/beta ratio calculate allow various dose fractionation scheme compare . The alpha-beta ratio generally &gt; 10 Gy early-responding tissue skin , mucosa , tumor &lt; 5 Gy late respond tissue connective tissue muscle . Recent evidence reveals prostate cancer low alpha/beta ratio , imply cell sensitive dos deliver large fraction size . Further , give low alpha-beta ratio prostate cancer bladder rectal mucosa ( significant late toxicity occur ) create potential therapeutic gain large fraction size . Based upon , increase trend reduce total treatment time administer high dose/fraction . There number phase I trials report use hypofractionated regimen treatment low intermediate risk prostate cancer ( primary ) definitive setting . These trial show excellent biochemical control toxicity profile . A five institutional cooperative phase I/II trial explore tolerance efficacy 3 increasingly hypofractionated radiation regimens equivalent predict late toxicity recently report abstract form . A total 307 men enrol biochemical progression free survival 95 % 5 year . At 2 year , actuarial rectal bleed 8 % case resolve either spontaneously minor intervention . One caveat dose escalation dose 74-80 Gy current radiation therapy treatment give daily fraction size 2 Gy/day treatment last approximately 2 month . The prolonged nature radiation treatment course cite prostate cancer patient primary reason choose RT . The combination high dose rate brachytherapy external beam radiation therapy recently publish . The protocol use single HDR treatment 15 Gy follow EBRT dose 37.5 Gy 15 fraction . One hundred twenty three patient follow median 45 month . Biochemical disease-free survival 95 % two year prostate biopsy positive 4 % men . Further , acute grade 3 high GU toxicity experience 2 patient 1 patient develop grade 3 late GU toxicity . The grade 3 toxicity hemorrhagic cystitis require cysto-prostatectomy ; however patient also diagnose scleroderma telangiectasia ( CREST ) syndrome , generally contraindication radiation therapy may contribute factor toxicity . There 4 % grade 2 GI toxicity consist proctitis . Patient report toxicity use EPIC tool notable decrease urinary , bowel sexual domain score first 2 year follow treatment , median urinary bowel domain score significantly different baseline 3 4 year .</detailed_description>
