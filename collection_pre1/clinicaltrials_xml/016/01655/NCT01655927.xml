	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Tranexamic Acid effective reduction intraoperative bleeding loss brain tumor resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Tranexamic Acid Brain Tumor Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain tumor resection associate increase blood loss significant increase incidence Intravascular disseminate coagulopathy . The development coagulopathy context tumor resection associate poor result . Transfusion decision course neurosurgical surgery offer benefit increase oxygen carry capacity may increase risk associate transfusion blood infection , hemolysis , lung injury immunosuppression . The information available tranexamic acid use neurosurgery little , therefore open new alternative technique reduce intraoperative bleeding . Tranexamic acid antifibrinolytic agent block bind plasminogen fibrin surface . It use reduce blood loss coronary revascularization , liver resection , obstetrics orthopedic procedure . Tranexamic acid intraoperatively show reduce blood loss 45 % . The primary concern administer antifibrinolytic drug potential increase incidence thromboembolic event . There actual data utility tranexamic acid reduce blood loss brain tumor resection surgery . We want compare Tranexamic Acid Saline solution ( Placebo ) see whether Tranexamic ACid Administration reduce blood loss brain tumor resection . Reduction transfusion requirement lead reduce cost possible reduction complication blood transfusion perioperative incident .</detailed_description>
