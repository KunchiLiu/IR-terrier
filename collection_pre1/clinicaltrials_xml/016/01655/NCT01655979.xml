	<brief_summary>The human show live work space environment , due lack essential mechanical load muscle bone , fluid-shift well alteration acid-base balance ( mainly account nutritional factor ) , exposure microgravity result gradual degradation muscle , bone cartilage , deconditioning cardiovascular system metabolic change . Countermeasures prevent deconditioning physiological system yet fully effective require investigation . A commonly utilized model simulate physiological effect microgravity human organism ground 6Â° head-down-tilt bed rest . In present study model use study potential countermeasure spaceflight-associated deconditioning . One constrictive change appear space flight well bed rest , disuse-induced muscle loss . These associated decrease muscle protein synthesis , rather increase muscle protein breakdown . Besides effective training countermeasure , nutritional countermeasure gain respect context : supplementing conventional diet whey protein essential amino acid show increase muscle protein synthesis . Due anabolic property whey protein seem promising counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting . Drawbacks high protein intake calciuric effect , ascribe proton-release metabolize sulfur-containing amino acid . The call 'low grade metabolic acidosis ' also show activate osteoclastic bone resorption muscle protein degradation . Therefore , maximize anabolic potential whey protein supplementation , acidogenic property need compensate . As previous work suggest , shift acid base balance acid direction result change bone protein turnover may hinder supplement alkaline mineral salt . In regard , mid-term bed rest study perform order investigate effect combine whey protein ( 0.6 g/kg body weight/day ) potassium bicarbonate ( 90 mmol/day ) supplementation potential countermeasure multiple physiological metabolic alteration human body result real simulated microgravity .</brief_summary>
