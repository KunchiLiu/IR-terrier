	<brief_title>Evaluation Gertner Tele-Motion-Rehabilitation System Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telerehabilitation refers use Information Communication Technologies ( ICT ) provide rehabilitation service people remotely home environment . By use ICT , patient access care improve reach clinician extend beyond physical wall traditional healthcare facility , thus expand continuity care person disable condition . Telerehabilitation hold significant potential meet need provide service accessible people , ability offer affordable enhance level care . The overall goal study evaluate clinical effectiveness home-based tele-motion-rehabilitation ( TMR ) program improve functional status people stroke . We hypothesize clinical effectiveness within mock-up set hospital TMR great comparison self-training exercise carry home improve function weak upper extremity performance Activities Daily Living . Twenty-four subject stroke ( verified via CT MRI ) , age 18 80 year , live home caregiver participate . Subjects 2-72 month post stroke , long receive rehabilitation patient . They moderate impairment affected upper extremity determine range motion ( ROM ) ; shoulder flexion abduction must 45 degree mild moderate compensation ; elbow flexion 30 degree . Measures use characterize level ability include : NIH Stroke Scale , Mini-Mental State Examination , Sensory evaluation ( light touch , extinction , stereognosis , proprioception ) , Behavioral Assessment Dysexecutive Syndrome ( BADS ) ; use study outcome measure . The subject evaluate 2 session different day total 5-6 hour . The second session include set treatment goal either treatment condition . Primary outcome measure include Range Motion ( ROM ) shoulder , elbow trunk , Chedoke Arm Hand Activity Inventory ( CAHAI ) , Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) . Secondary outcome measure include Functional Reach Test ( FRT ) ( sit stand ) , Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) Pain evaluation , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) . Responses tele game activity monitor use follow tool : BORG scale perceive effort , Short Feedback Questionnaire ( SFQ ) , Tele-game score , arm trunk 3-Dimensional kinematics ; use outcome measure . Subjects randomize two group ( 12 tele 12 self-training treatment ) two group match level impairment upper extremity . Each subject receive twelve 45-60 min session ( 3 session per week 4 week ) one two type treatment seat . The control group receive self-training exercise base conventional therapy use principle motor control include train upper extremity movement order achieve good use affect arm ADL . Each subject receive list exercise perform home use stand-alone poster target movement . In addition , subject ask write date duration time he/she exercise . They contact therapist week monitor self training program adjust level exercise . The experimental group receive tele-rehabilitation treatment comparable duration intensity conventional treatment group . However , treatment deliver via Gertner Tele-Motion Rehabilitation system remote online monitoring therapist . Treatment feedback give form Knowledge result ( game score ) Knowledge performance ( feedback compensatory movement make use upper extremity ) enhance motor learning . The software generate report include duration type exercise perform subject . If need , personal attendant may provide physical support tele home mock-up room . The Gertner Tele-Motion-Rehabilitation system implement via Microsoft 's Kinect three-dimensional ) camera-based gesture recognition technology without additional accessory ( i.e. , need head mount helmet glove ) . Using patient 's natural hand body movement control activity within customize computer game . The system run standard desktop computer display large television screen . The patient may see ( whole body hand ) within virtual environment may see virtual object manipulate . Each subject meeting inclusion criterion sign inform consent . Subjects randomly assign one two group person part study . Each subject assess outcome test list skilled therapist blind group 's assignment subject . The evaluation repeat 3 time , intervention commences , immediately follow intervention four week intervention .</detailed_description>
