	<brief_title>Study Tranexamic Acid Reducing Blood Requirement Patients Undergoing Major Gastro-intestinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Surgery one major cause blood loss . Though major blood loss associate cardiovascular procedure , liver transplantation etc , transfusion frequently require major gastrointestinal surgery Whipples Procedure ; Liver resection etc.1 Transfusion associate numerous risk mismatch transfusion , allergic reaction , transmission infection , acute lung injury etc.2 Though transfusion life saving , essential rationalize transfusion whenever possible . A number agent try past stabilizes coagulation system body minimize blood loss ; ideal agent yet find . Tranexamic acid , { trans-4- ( aminomethyl ) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid } competitive inhibitor plasminogen activation , much high concentration , noncompetitive inhibitor plasmin.3 Tranexamic acid first approve FDA 1986 injection , brand name Cyklokapron® . This agent use last 40 year many traumatic condition various success wax waning use . There resurgence interest use lately know molecule . Tranexamic acid find effective orthopedic surgeries.4,5,6 A Cochrane review 'antifibrinolytic use minimize perioperative blood transfusion ' involve 21 trail tranexamic acid vs. control patient undergo orthopedic surgery show significant reduction blood transfusion perioperative blood loss.7 Randomized trial tranexamic acid do cardiac surgery patient early 1996 show significant reduction red-cell transfusion blood products.8 CRASH 2 Trial ( Clinical Randomization Antifibrinolytic Significant Haemorrhage ) large placebo-controlled trial study effect early administration short course tranexamic acid death , vascular occlusive event blood transfusion adult trauma patient significant hemorrhage . It involve 274 hospital across 40 country start 2005 conclude tranexamic acid could safely reduce risk death bleed trauma patients.9 Intraoperative use low dose tranexamic acid observe safe effective reduce rate perioperative blood transfusion patient undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy.10 It also approve FDA use menorrhagia . Though used gastrointestinal bleed abdominal trauma , routinely use major gastrointestinal surgery . In context , study undertaken evaluate efficacy tranexamic acid major gastrointestinal surgery . Investigators hypothesize addition Tranexamic acid , antifibrinolytic agent , conventional therapy lead improve outcome characterize low transfusion requirement . Detailed Description : After inform consent obtain patient randomize receive either Tranexamic acid along conventional therapy conventional therapy . All patient undergo major gastrointestinal surgery ( involve resection stomach , pancreas , esophagus , colon , liver ) include surgery decide surgeon prior surgery . Randomization do prior surgery close envelope method . Tranexamic acid administer load dose 1 gm intravenously 10 minute , 30minutes surgery follow 10mg / kg body weight , 8 hourly 5 day . Post operative blood requirement fluids drain monitor along HB/PCV level every day 7 day drain remove . Tranexamic acid antifibrinolytic agent show associate reduced bleeding transfusion requirement surgical patient . We would like randomize patient receive either Tranexamic acid addition conventional therapy conventional therapy monitor outcome . Intraoperative blood requirement usually govern intraoperative blood loss hence , post operative blood transfusion take 'Post operative blood requirement ' patient . Post operative complication assess accord Clavien-Dindo Classification system surgical complications.11,12,13 Patients monitor discharge 30 day assess complication . Duration ICU stay , duration admission Mortality monitor group patient . Requirement Transfusion assess operating surgeon . Patients monitor post operatively hemoglobin PCV level drain fluid amount nature . Transfusion give ongoing blood loss discretion operate surgeon hemoglobin level &lt; 8milligram per deciliter hemoglobin hematocrit value le 24 percent healthy individual &lt; 10mg/dl high risk patients.14 Transfusion Fresh Frozen Plasma ( FFP ) Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) do require . This study provide u information efficacy medicine patient undergo major GI surgery . Data trial provide u information utility pursue modality therapy .</detailed_description>
