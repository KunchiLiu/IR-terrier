	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test well investigational treatment , Engineered Skin Substitutes ( ESS-W ) , work cover treat burn wound . The area body treat ESS-W compare similar area treat patient 's skin ( split-thickness skin autograft ( AG ) ) . A skin autograft ( AG ) perform take healthy skin one area body place burned area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Autologous Engineered Skin Substitute Treat Partial- Full-Thickness Burn Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate safety efficacy autologous engineer skin substitute ( ESS-W ) compare conventional split-thickness AG treatment extensive , deep partial- full-thickness thermal burn . A matched randomized burn site format use evaluate successful graft take excised deep partial- full-thickness burn graft either 1 ) unmeshed ESS-W 2 ) mesh AG ( current standard treatment split thickness AG ) . This research study divide five study period : ( 1 ) Screening Period one week ( 2 ) Pre-Grafting Period , last approximately 35-45 day , ( 3 ) Grafting Day ( ) , day ( ) graft apply ( i.e. , First Graft : Day 0 optional subsequent Grafting Day i.e. , Second Graft : Day 0 ) , ( 4 ) Post Grafting Observation Period , begin 28 day follow-up Grafting Day ( ) , continue till Post-Operative Month ( POM ) 6 last Grafting Day , ( 5 ) Anecdotal Observation Period</detailed_description>
