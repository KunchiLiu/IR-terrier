	<brief_summary>This trial conduct order compare angiographic outcomes patient receive 0.014-0.0155 '' platinum frame fill coil ( large diameter coil ) versus treat solely coil less 0.014 '' ( standard diameter ) . Hypothesis : Angiographic occlusion follow-up imaging frequent patient receive 0.014-0.0155 '' platinum coil embolization compare receive smaller-diameter coil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Study Objective : Occlusion rate : angiographic occlusion , improvement change post-coiling appearance aneurysm judge independent core lab follow-up angiography 12-18 month endovascular embolization . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Treatment related morbidity mortality , measure NIH stroke scale . 2 . Packing density measure volumetric fill aneurysm . 3 . Clinical outcome 3-6 12-18 month post-coiling , measure modify Rankin scale . 4 . Re-hemorrhage re-treatment rate . Study Design : FEAT prospective , randomized trial compare utilization 0.014-0.0155 '' coil versus small diameter coil mid-sized aneurysm treatment . The 0.014-0.0155 '' bare platinum coil ( Stryker , Natick , MA ) FDA-approved common use institution country across world . Patients enrol meet inclusion criterion consent participate . Patients randomly assigned central web-based system 1:1 manner either framing coil treatment non-framing coil treatment . Data patient collect time enrollment treatment , first second follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient presenting rupture unruptured cerebral aneurysm appropriate endovascular treatment determine neurovascular treating team ( neurointerventionist and/or neurosurgeon ) . 2 . The neurointerventionist feel aneurysm safely treat either use , use , 0.0150.0155 '' platinum coil . 3 . Patients 1880 year age ( inclusive ) . 4 . Patient must Hunt Hess grade 0 3 . 5 . Patient give fully inform consent endovascular coiling procedure . If patient consent , appropriate write consent seek next kin appropriate power attorney . 6 . Aneurysm 614 mm maximum diameter . 7 . Patient willing able return clinical evaluation followup image evaluation ( angiography MRA ) 36 month 1218 month endovascular treatment . 8 . The patient previously randomize trial another related ongoing trial . 9 . The aneurysm previously treat coil clip . 1 . Patient one aneurysm require treatment current treatment session , one treat aneurysms fit FEAT inclusion criterion ( ie either ( 1 ) patient multiple aneurysm , one treat enrollment ; ( 2 ) two aneurysm treat current treatment session BOTH able enrol , remain eligible trial ) . Nontreated additional aneurysm may treat later date coil type operator choose ) . 2 . Target aneurysm previous coil treatment surgically clip . 3 . Hunt Hess score 4 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage . 4 . Inability obtain informed consent . 5 . Medical surgical comorbidity patient 's life expectancy le 2 year .</criteria>
