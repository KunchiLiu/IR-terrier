	<brief_summary>This study conduct men schedule undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUSP ) . Traditionally prior prostate biopsy , antibiotic , ciprofloxacin , give men prevent biopsy-related infection . In recent year ciprofloxacin resistance increase community , men become infect ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria prostate biopsy . This study do determine obtain rectal swab culture choose antibiotic base culture result result few infectious complication give men ciprofloxacin . The investigator compare 2 group : men whose rectal swab show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria receive ciprofloxacin prior biopsy , men whose swab show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria receive alternative antibiotic base culture result . Our hypothesis 2 group equal number post-biopsy infectious complication group fewer infectious complication historical group receive empiric ciprofloxacin without benefit rectal swab culture result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective , nonrandomized trial evaluate efficacy direct antimicrobial prophylaxis prior transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUSP ) compare ciprofloxacin prophylaxis , current standard care . Northwestern University lead site . After sign informed consent , study participant complete pre-biopsy questionnaire record demographic assess know risk factor infection rectal swab obtain . Patients whose swabs indicate colonization ciprofloxacin-susceptible gram-negative bacteria ( CS-GNB ) receive ciprofloxacin pre-procedure prophylaxis whose swabs indicate colonization ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria ( CR-GNB ) receive pre-procedure antimicrobial prophylaxis base study protocol . All patient contact phone twice biopsy , approximately 7 30 day , detail post-procedure infectious complication include fever , urinary tract infection , bacteremia sepsis . Subjects experience infection additional information regard infectious complication cost therapy abstract medical record . The TRUSP result also record . Bacterial isolate rectal swab archive .</detailed_description>
