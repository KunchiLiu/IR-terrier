	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess relief symptom Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBOT ) patient late radiation cystitis Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) symptom estimation scale primary variable . Study hypothesis : - HBOT reduce reverse change otherwise limit damage bladder function and/or structure , arose result radiation therapy cancer pelvic region organ . - The effect HBOT associate relief symptom , least part , relate reduction extent radiation damage . - Vascular density increase , fibrosis prevalence inflammatory activity reduce sign improve function mucosa . - Treatment result HBOT remain , whole part , follow-up ( residual effect )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy commonly use management malignant disease . Despite continuous improvement technique , improve efficacy tolerance , adverse effect still rather common . The urinary bladder rectum major organ commonly affect radiotherapy pelvis area . One significant cause symptoms radio therapy inflammation degeneration blood vessel radiate tissue . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involve administration oxygen great normal atmospheric pressure . A well-documented effect HBOT stimulation angiogenesis . HBOT establish treatment degeneration blood vessel jaw bone result radiotherapy several publication show good efficacy also soft tissue affect . If method treatment HBOT mean reduction radiotherapy side effect thus obvious importance individual patient . There also significant potential saving healthcare society .</detailed_description>
