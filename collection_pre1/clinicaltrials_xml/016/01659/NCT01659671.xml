	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Pharyngeal surgery ( UPPP ) reduce significantly nightly respiratory breathing pause ( apnoeas-hypopnoeas ) improve daytime symptom compare expectancy 6 month patient OSAS . Background : Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) associate increase risk poor sleep quality , excessive daytime sleepiness prolong reaction time , elevate risk traffic accident . Increased morbidity three four time increased mortality patient well document , mainly cardiovascular field . Pharyngeal surgery , i.e . uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ( UPPP ) open airway predominant treatment OSAS worldwide continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device become widely available 1990s . Since , main treatment OSAS CPAP , increase number patient also treat mandibular retaining device ( MRD ) . UPPP treatment OSAS perform 30 year . The evidence-grade efficacy far low , side-effects complication rate raise question whether place surgical treatment OSAS . However , compliance CPAP dental device quite low ( 50-60 % ) , leave lot patient untreated surgery offer . RCT UPPP still miss call .</brief_summary>
