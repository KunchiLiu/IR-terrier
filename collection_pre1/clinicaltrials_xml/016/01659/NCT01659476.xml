	<brief_summary>The objective research compare ( ) bronchodilating ( ii ) bronchoprotective effect deep inspiration ( DIs ) individual : ( ) asthma , ( b ) CVA , ( c ) methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity . ( ) healthy individual ( without asthma , chronic cough asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness ) . Hypotheses : . The bronchodilating effect DI : ( ) absent impaired individual classic asthma ; ( b ) impair individual CVA ; ( c ) preserve individual methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity ; ( ) preserve healthy individual ( without asthma , chronic cough asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness ) . ii . The bronchoprotective effect DI : ( ) absent individual classic asthma ; ( b ) impair individual CVA ; ( c ) preserve methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity ; ( ) preserve healthy individual ( without asthma , chronic cough asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness ) . iii . Healthy individual without asthma , chronic cough , asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness , cough , develop significant dyspnea , small airway obstruction dynamic hyperinflation high-dose methacholine bronchoprovocation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic respiratory condition characterize eosinophilic airway inflammation . Individuals classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptom include cough , wheeze , shortness breath chest tightness . Cough variant asthma ( CVA ) asthma chronic cough ( cough lasting eight week ) sole predominant symptom asthma . The pathophysiologic mechanism differentiate asthma , CVA , eosinophilic bronchitis without asthma fully understood . We recently identify individual chronic cough cough methacholine normal airway sensitivity ( ie . asthma CVA ) may may eosinophilic bronchitis . The purpose research examine pathophysiologic difference three cause chronic cough : asthma , cough variant asthma methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity . The response healthy normal subject crucial understand clinical relevance methacholine-induced cough normal airway sensitivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals age 1865 year age asthma , CVA individual methacholineinduced cough normal airway sensitivity . The following definition use : 1. asthma : episodic respiratory symptom occur association variable airflow obstruction ( Canadian Asthma Consensus Report definition ) ; 2 . CVA : chronic cough ( ≥8 week ) sole predominant symptom positive methacholine challenge ( PC20 ≤ 16 mg/mL ) history cough respond specific asthma treatment ( inhale steroid 1 week trial bronchodilator ) ; 3 . Methacholineinduced cough normal airway sensitivity : chronic cough ( ≥8 week ) sole predominant symptom negative methacholine challenge ( PC20 &gt; 16 mg/mL ) . Individuals age 1865 year age history asthma chronic cough . exacerbation necessitate change medication , emergency department visit hospitalization within previous 4 week inability perform acceptable spirometry medical contraindication methacholine challenge test 1 . Severe airflow limitation ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict &lt; 1.0 L ) ; 2 . Heart attack stroke last 3 month ; 3 . Uncontrolled hypertension , systolic BP &gt; 200 diastolic BP &gt; 100 ; 4 . Known aortic aneurysm ; 5 . Moderate airflow limitation &lt; 60 % predict 1.5 ) relative contraindication ; 6 . Inability perform acceptable quality spirometry ; 7 . Current use cholinesterase inhibitor medication ( myasthenia gravis ) ; 8 . Pregnant nursing mother . smoke history excess 10 pack year Note : Previous treatment inhale systemic corticosteroid exclusion criterion ; medication use record examined analysis .</criteria>
