	<brief_summary>Standard treatment rectum cancer pre-surgery course external beam radiotherapy give chemotherapy time . External beam radiation increase side effect short long-term expose normal tissue nearby tumor bladder , bowel sexual organ . Instead , study use different way deliver radiation call brachytherapy decrease normal tissue radiation exposure . Patient give three chemotherapy medication surgery : oxaliplatin ( also call EloxatinTM ) combination 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) leucovorin ( also call Folinic Acid ) . The purpose study find whether give chemotherapy brachytherapy surgery : 1 ) enable patient 's surgeon successfully remove tumor 2 ) low risk tumor recurrence 3 ) avoid patient side effect relate chemotherapy external beam radiation therapy 4 ) improve patient 's ability complete chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Preoperative High-dose-rate Endorectal Brachytherapy FOLFOX Chemotherapy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary Introduction Rationale : Over past 30 year , major advance adjuvant therapy surgical technique markedly improved cure rate patient locoregionally advanced rectal cancer pelvic tumor control 90 % . Preoperative chemoradiation consist 5 ½ week external beam radiotherapy combine radiosensitizing 5-fluorouracil followed total mesorectal excision ( TME ) adjuvant chemotherapy represent current standard care . Despite improved survival locoregional control , disease-free survival plateaued rate 70 % high incidence distant metastasis 1/3 patient . Clearly , development effective systemic therapy approach eliminate micrometastatic disease need improve survival outcome . The incorporation oxaliplatin , combine 5-fluorouracil ( FOLFOX ) , adjuvant treatment resect stage II-III colon cancer lead clinically statistically significant improvement disease-free overall survival colon cancer . In rectal cancer , FOLFOX use primarily TME compliance rate typically 70 % . One approach address systemic disease improve compliance treat patient FOLFOX chemotherapy upfront prior locoregional therapy . Moreover , incorporate effective radiation regimen low incidence short long-term side effect may enhance compliance systemic therapy . External beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) increase side effect acute chronic toxicity expose normal tissue nearby tumor bladder , bowel , sexual organ . An appeal technical alternative EBRT brachytherapy ( BT ) approach use rectal applicator place intraluminally direct contact tumor deliver radiation spar adjacent normal organ decrease exposure pelvic bone marrow . A rectal brachytherapy approach treat 300 patient report McGill group show equivalent pelvic control , high pathologic complete response rate low short long-term toxicity . The rectal brachytherapy regimen consist 4 daily treatment one week give without chemotherapy significantly shorten treatment time cost compare standard course fractionate external beam pelvic radiotherapy . One concern rectal brachytherapy approach pelvic node typically cover external beam technique may result suboptimal outcome . However , careful pattern failure study large Dutch preoperative external beam randomize study show low rate isolate pelvic nodal relapse minimal benefit external beam radiotherapy decrease failure . Proposal investigator propose combine pre-operative FOLFOX chemotherapy high dose rate endorectal brachytherapy follow surgery additional FOLFOX chemotherapy improve compliance . Primary Endpoint The purpose study find whether give chemotherapy new technique deliver radiation therapy surgery improve compliance systemic therapy 10 % baseline 70 % . Secondary Endpoints 1 . Locoregional failure 2 . Distant Metastasis 3 . Bladder , Bowel , Sexual function Bone Marrow Toxicity 4 . Quality Life 5 . Pathologic complete response rate 6 . Molecular change pre- post-treatment tumor specimen Study Design The treatment regimen would consist 6 cycle FOLFOX HDR-ERBT ( 4 consecutive daily treatment deliver 26Gy ) follow 6-8 week TME surgery additional 6 cycle FOLFOX chemotherapy recovery surgery . HDR-ERBT give 4 cycle FOLFOX . *Brachytherapy give subject Beth Israel Medical Center .</detailed_description>
