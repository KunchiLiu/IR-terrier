	<brief_summary>The aim study characterize safety immunogenicity Menactra® population &lt; 2 year age administer alone second dose administer concomitantly 4th dose Pentacel® , license pediatric vaccine . Primary Objectives : - To evaluate compare antibody responses meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W-135 induce 2 injection Menactra® subject age 9 month first vaccination visit 15 18 month second vaccination visit . - To evaluate compare antibody responses Pertussis ( pertussis toxoid [ PT ] , filamentous haemagglutinin [ FHA ] pertactin [ PRN ] ) antigens induced dose Pentacel® administer concomitantly Menactra® elicit dose Pentacel® administer alone . - To evaluate compare antibody responses polyribosylribitol phosphate ( PRP ) , tetanus diphtheria antigen induce dose Pentacel® administer concomitantly Menactra® elicit dose Pentacel® alone . Observational Objectives : - To describe safety profile ( immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minute trial vaccination , solicit reaction within 7 day vaccination , unsolicited AEs within 30 day vaccination , serious adverse event [ SAEs ] throughout course trial Day 0 Day 30 last trial vaccination [ ] ) trial group - To describe antibody response meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W-135 , measure SBA HC , 30 day second Menactra® administration - To describe antibody response Pentacel® ( PT , FHA , PRN , FIM , diphtheria , tetanus , polio , PRP ) measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) , functional assay .</brief_summary>
