	<brief_title>The Long-term Efficacy Electrical Pudendal Nerve Stimulation Urgency-Frequency Syndrome Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urgency-frequency syndrome ( UFS ) often refractory pharmacotherapy . Electrical neuromodulation prove valuable situation . The electrical neuromodulation therapy include transvaginal electrical stimulation ( TES ) , percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) , sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) pudendal nerve stimulation ( PNS ) . Their effect explain modulation reflex pathways spinal supraspinal level . TES easily applicable sometimes intolerable many patient due discomfort , mucosal injury high intensity stimulation acceptable outcome . SNS differs TES continuous stimulation close nerve contact . It high rate success , symptom appear recur almost immediately discontinuation stimulation least 20 % patient initially test respond test procedure . Its disadvantage include invasiveness procedure , high cost treatment , high surgical revision rate , device replacement adverse event . Because pudendal nerve ( PN ) afferents particularly important inhibitory effect void reflex SNS excite part PN afferent , direct PN stimulation may effective . PNS use treat UFS refractory SNS , therapy also disadvantage similar SNS . PTNS minimally invasive , demonstrate efficacy , easily applicable well tolerate , result chronic PTNS treatment unknown initially successful patient PTNS effect diminish time . By combine advantage PNS PTNS incorporate technique deep insertion long acupuncture needle , develop electrical pudendal nerve stimulation ( EPNS ) . In EPNS , long acupuncture needle 0.40 Х 100 125 mm deeply inserted four sacral point electrify stimulate pudendal nerve . CT transverse plane coccygeal apex show position lower needle tip similar ( adjacent PN Alcock 's canal ) Bion device implant chronic PN stimulation . Besides radiographic evidence , simultaneous record perineal ultrasonographic PFM contraction , vaginal pressure pelvic floor surface electromyogram previous study prove EPNS exactly excite PN . Our previous study also prove EPNS good post-treatment effect UFS woman . The purpose present study show long-term efficacy EPNS UFS woman .</detailed_description>
