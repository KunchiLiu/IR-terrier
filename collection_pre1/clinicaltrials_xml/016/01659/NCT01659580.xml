	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Dantonic® ( T89 ) Capsule Prevent Treat Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dantonic® ( T89 ) botanical drug consist extract Danshen ( Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae ) Sanqi ( Radix Notoginseng ) borneol capsule form . The drug currently approve 26 country outside USA treatment prevention chronic stable angina pectoris cardiovascular disease related condition . This pivotal confirmative Phase III clinical trial confirm efficacy safety drug 150mg 225mg dos prevention treatment angina pectoris patient Chronic Stable Angina . The contribution main herb Danshen , difference various production batch , overall efficacy safety profile also explore . Patients take morning evening dose orally ( every 12 hour ) 6 week stop take long-acting nitroglycerin , ranolazine , and/or multiple beta-blockers beta blocker ( ) calcium channel blocker trial . Single beta-blocker and/or on-demand short act nitroglycerin relief angina pectoris allow trial . After physical exam eligible participation , patient stop take drug , undergo two baseline screen Exercise Treadmill Tests ( ETT ) Standard Bruce Protocol clinic one week right start drug treatment . Patients perform three ETTs morning dose end week 2 , 4 6 receive drug treatment . The primary efficiency endpoint change symptom-limited Total Exercise Duration ETT end 4th week treatment average two screen baseline compare placebo treatment .</detailed_description>
