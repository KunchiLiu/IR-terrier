	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational therapy use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention still study research doctor try find . Retroperitoneal sarcomas soft tissue tumor locate far back abdomen . Typically , patient retroperitoneal sarcomas either surgery removal tumor alone , tumor remove , follow standard radiation therapy , pre-operative radiation follow surgery . When conventional radiation therapy deliver surgery , damage normal tissue . In study , undergo proton beam radiation therapy IMRT undergoing surgery removal tumor . Proton radiation IMRT FDA approve radiation delivery system . Protons tiny particle positive charge control travel certain distance stop inside body . In theory , allow good control radiation dose deliver compare photon . Since proton radiation target , may help reduce unwanted side effect radiation . In study , standard dose radiation give majority tumor , simultaneously integrated boost additional radiation give certain area tumor identify high risk . This mean high radiation dose give high risk area tumor . The purpose study determine high dose radiation therapy proton IMRT deliver safely patient retroperitoneal sarcomas effectiveness proton beam radiation therapy intervention patient retroperitoneal sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While screen determine eligibility study may choose participate additional blood sample circulate DNA genomic DNA sample . Since look high dose Radiation Therapy administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant retroperitoneal sarcoma , everyone participates research study receive dose study therapy . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Your study doctor tell dose get . Radiation plan standard care patient undergo radiation therapy . Before begin radiation therapy radiation plan CT scan tumor site . This scan addition scan do order confirm eligibility study . Doctors use teh image scan plan radiation treatment . You receive radiation therapy every day Monday Friday six week . You receive study therapy outpatient . During radiation therapy , see study doctor week . Each visit take 15 minute , follow assessment complete : medical history , vital sign , body weight assessment side effect may experience . After final dose radiation therapy assess side effect radiation follow last dose surgery . The following assessment complete surgery visit : Chest CT , CT/MRI abdomen/pelvis routine blood test check overall health . You see follow-up visit within one month discharge follow surgery four month surgery . At first follow-up visit , follow assessment complete : medical history , vital sign body weight , question side effect routine blood test check overall health . At four month follow visit follow assessment complete : medical history , vital sign body weight , chest CT abdominal/pelvic CT. After four month follow-up visit , see twice yearly follow radiation first five year year rest life .</detailed_description>
