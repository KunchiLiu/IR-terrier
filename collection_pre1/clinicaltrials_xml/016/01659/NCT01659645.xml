	<brief_summary>Breast carcinoma frequent cancer woman , affect estimate 207,090 2010 lead 39,840 cancer relate death . Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection ( FDG ) Positron Emission Tomography , ( PET ) PET-CT become standard method isolate tumor . However , FDG insensitive small breast tumor certain histologic type lobular , certain type breast carcinoma . In addition , FDG uptake nonspecific since inflammatory benign lesion may also evidence accumulation radiotracer . Hence need tracer/imaging tool increase ability characterize detect breast carcinoma detect locoregional spread , well monitor therapeutic treatment response . anti-3- [ 18F ] . anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid ( FACBC ) amino acid base PET radiotracer show utility detect variety tumor . In cell culture experiment , FACBC show uptake breast tumor cell line . The primary aim study determine FACBC PET-CT demonstrates uptake within breast carcinoma ( primary site and/or locoregional lymph node ) study uptake kinetics via time-activity curve dynamic imaging characteristic . The investigator enroll 12 patient breast mass mass and/or lymph node naïve therapy undergo biopsy post-biopsy pre-therapy . All patient undergo standard care image appropriate mammography , ultrasound , MR , and/or FDG PET-CT scanning . The investigator compare finding determine radiotracer worthy study comprehensive experiment .</brief_summary>
