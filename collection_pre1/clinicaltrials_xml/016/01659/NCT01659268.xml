	<brief_title>Performance Baccalaureate Nursing Students Insertion Laryngeal Mask : Trial Mannequins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The airway control priority patient resuscitation . The Laryngeal Mask Airway ( LMA ) minimize complication , establish safe airway . Is fundamental nurse acquire skill act emergency situation ; simulation important learning tool , allow realistic environment allow student possibility training skill . Hypothesis : There difference acquisition knowledge skills airway management baccalaureate nursing student submit different learn strategy : classroom lecture-dialogued follow laboratory activity practice low-fidelity mannequin simulation laboratory low-fidelity mannequin ? The aim study compare effect teaching-learning strategy : classroom lecture-dialogued follow laboratory activity practice low-fidelity mannequin simulation laboratory low-fidelity mannequin , acquisition knowledge skill baccalaureate nursing . This randomize controlled trial , population student baccalaureate nurse EERP-USP , eighth period , 69 student total ; sample voluntary compose student accept participate study . The intervention group ( IG ) submit simulation class control group ( CG ) exhibition-dialogued class , practical activity skill lab . The study 3 step : 1 . The participant recruit letter poster , randomize IG CG follow submit write pre-test . 2 . The GI submit simulation laboratory de CG classroom lecture-dialogued follow laboratory activity practice . The focus airway management emphasis LMA . 3 . All participant submit write post test follow practice test simulation scenario , medium-fidelity mannequin , simulate human physiologic condition . The scenario appraiser checklist performance score skills intervention observe . The activity film record . To data analysis use SPSS software : descriptive statistic , chi-square test , t-test Student .</detailed_description>
