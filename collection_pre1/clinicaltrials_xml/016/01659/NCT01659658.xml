	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dexamethasone plus IXAZOMIB improve hematologic response , 2-year vital organ ( , heart kidney ) deterioration mortality rate versus physician 's choice chemotherapy regimen participant diagnose relapsed refractory systemic light chain ( AL ) amyloidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dexamethasone Plus IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) Physicians Choice Treatment Relapsed Refractory Systemic Light Chain ( AL ) Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call IXAZOMIB . IXAZOMIB test treat people relapse Refractory Systemic Light Chain ( AL ) Amyloidosis . The study enroll approximately 248 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group : - IXAZOMIB 4 mg plus Dexamethasone 20 mg - Physician 's choice : Participants receive one follow treatment option select physician : 1 . Dexamethasone 20 mg 2 . Dexamethasone 20 mg + Melphalan 0.22 mg/kg 3 . Dexamethasone 20 mg + Cyclophosphamide 500 mg 4 . Dexamethasone 20 mg + Thalidomide 200 mg 5 . Dexamethasone 20 mg + Lenalidomide 15 mg 6 . All participant ask take oral formulation drug . In treatment arm , participant continue receive sequential cycle therapy disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study terminate , whichever occur first . Participants Arm B receive melphalan dexamethasone treat best response plus 2 additional cycle . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 112 month ( 9.3 year ) , include 84 month enrollment 28 month follow-up last participant enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female participant 18 year old . 2 . Biopsyproven diagnosis primary systemic light chain amyloidosis ( AL amyloidosis ) accord follow standard criterion : 1 . Histochemical diagnosis amyloidosis , base tissue specimen Congo red stain exhibition applegreen birefringence 2 . If clinical laboratory parameter insufficient establish AL amyloidosis case doubt , amyloid type may necessary . 3 . Measurable disease define serum differential free light chain concentration ( dFLC , difference amyloid form [ involve ] nonamyloid form [ uninvolved ] free light chain [ FLC ] ) ≥ 50 mg/L . 4 . Objective , measurable major ( cardiac renal ) organ amyloid involvement define follow ( amyloid involvement least 1 require ) : 1 . Cardiac involvement define presence mean leave ventricular wall thickness echocardiogram great 12 mm absence potential cause leave ventricular hypertrophy ( control hypertension allow ) noncardiac biopsy show amyloid , positive cardiac biopsy presence clinical laboratory evidence involvement . If isolated cardiac involvement , type amyloid deposit recommend . 2 . Renal involvement define proteinuria ( predominantly albumin ) &gt; 0.5 g/day 24hour urine collection . Note : Amyloid involvement organ system allow , require . 5 . Must relapse refractory 1 2 prior therapy . For protocol , relapse define progressive disease ( PD ) document 60 day last dose ; refractory define documented absence hematologic response hematologic progression within 60 day last dose prior therapy . 1 . Participant must previously treat proteasome inhibitor . ( The sponsor reserve right open study proteasome inhibitorexposed participant future , time point first interim analysis ( IA ) . In case , participant may refractory proteasome inhibitor therapy . ) 2 . Given physician may select offer list regimen treat specific participant , participant may refractory agent/s list within list offer treatment choice 3 . Must recover ( ie , ≤ Grade 1 toxicity participant 's baseline status ) reversible effect prior therapy 4 . If participant receive transplant his/her firstline therapy , he/she must least 3 month post transplantation recover side effect stem cell transplant . 6 . Must meet criterion 1 follow AL Amyloidosis Risk Stages ( define Nterminal proBNP [ NTproBNP ] cutoff &lt; 332 pg/mL troponin T cutoff 0.035 ng/mL threshold ) : 1 .
