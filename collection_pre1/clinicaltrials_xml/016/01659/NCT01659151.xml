	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect investigational combination medicine , include special immune cell ( T-cells ) . A T-cell type lymphocyte , white blood cell . Lymphocytes kind white blood cell protect body viral infection , help cell fight bacterial fungal infection , produce antibody , fight cancer , coordinate activity cell immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vemurafenib With Lymphodepletion Plus Adoptive Cell Transfer &amp; High Dose IL-2 Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , special immune T-cells take sample participant 's tumor tissue surgically remove . Certain part cell multiply , grow , laboratory . They give back patient infusion vein . These cell call tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) . The investigator want study benefit side effect TIL give follow combination drug : - Vemurafenib - type drug use slow growth certain type cancer cell . This drug give three week T-cells grown lab T-cell infusion two year . - Fludarabine cyclophosphamide - two type chemotherapy drug . These drug use call lymphodepletion . The purpose lymphodepletion study temporarily reduce number normal lymphocytes circulate patient 's body give T-cells grown lab . This `` space '' lymphocyte ( T-cells ) infuse vein . - Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) - drug use help body 's response treatment immune system . A high dose regimen IL-2 give receive infusion T-cells . The use TIL investigational , mean approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Vemurafenib IL-2 approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma melanoma surgically remove . The chemotherapy drug fludarabine cyclophosphamide , use lymphodepletion , approve FDA , treatment metastatic melanoma . The combination vemurafenib follow lymphodepletion chemotherapy , TIL infusion , high dose IL-2 investigational , proven help treat melanoma . This combination FDA approve ; however , FDA allow use study .</detailed_description>
