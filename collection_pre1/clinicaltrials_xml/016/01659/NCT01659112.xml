	<brief_title>Effects Core Stabilization Approach Patients With Upper Extremity Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal movement pattern one challenging problem rehabilitation patient upper extremity injury . They usually decrease functional status upper extremity prevent isolate muscle activation . Dysfunction kinetic chain system play important role development movement pattern . Thus , multi-segmental rehabilitation strategy recently gain considerable importance upper extremity rehabilitation . Core stabilization one popular rehabilitation approach prefer enhance functional stability kinetic chain system dynamic postural alignment activity . The purpose study determine effect core stabilization approach functional status upper extremity amount abnormal movement pattern . In addition , factor affect abnormal movement pattern determine .</detailed_description>
