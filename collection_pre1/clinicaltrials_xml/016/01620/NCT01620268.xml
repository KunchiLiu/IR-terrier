	<brief_title>An Open-Label , Study Treat Patients With Renal Allograft Polyoma BK Viruria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize trial evaluate effect combination leflunomide orotic acid treatment Polyoma BK viruria . In multicenter trial , renal allograft patient diagnosis Polyoma BK viruria determine viral level urine 25 million copies/mL , detectable viremia , complete screen visit ( V1 ) determine eligibility study base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Patients meet entrance criterion study randomly assign one two treatment group Visit ( 2 ) enter 4 month dose period .</detailed_description>
