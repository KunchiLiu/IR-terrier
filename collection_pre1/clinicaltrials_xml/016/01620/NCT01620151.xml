	<brief_summary>Primary : To compare post-operative pain patient neck extension without neck extension . Secondary : To determine benefit neck exposure peri-operative complication , include duration operation , intra-operative blood loss , recurrent nerve ( RLN ) injury hypocalcaemia group . Hypothesis : Patients undergo thyroidectomy without neck extension less post-operative pain significant difference post-operation complication group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Thyroid Surgery With Pillow Versus Pillow Better Post-operative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional open thyroid surgery still one common operation perform globally . Traditionally , patient undergo thyroid surgery usually position extended neck use pillow shoulder order facilitate neck exposure make surgery easier . However , degree benefit extend neck doubtful little objective evidence suggest extend neck thyroid surgery offer well outcome . On hand , over-extension neck avoid associate post-operative pain , vomiting , spinal damage stroke . The objective present study compare post-operative pain patient neck extension without neck extension . In addition , also like determine benefit neck exposure peri-operative complication , include duration operation , intra-operative blood loss , recurrent nerve ( RLN ) injury hypocalcaemia group . This prospective randomized control trial , conduct 1st March 2012 till 30th September 2012 . Given approximately 300 400 patient would undergo thyroid surgery year , estimate 180 patient recruit randomly divide 2 group ( neck extension neck extension ) undergo open thyroid surgery trial . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) use determine post-operative pain . Primary end point peri-operative variable analyze SPSS software .</detailed_description>
