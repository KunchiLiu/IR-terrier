	<brief_summary>Asthma inflammatory disease affect whole respiratory system , central peripheral airway . Anti-inflammatory treatment inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , without long-acting Î²2-adrenoceptor agonist ( LABA ) , cornerstone asthma management [ GINA Guideline - available www.ginasthma.com ] . Nevertheless , considerable subset asthmatic patient neither benefit ICS gain optimal asthma control even ICS/LABA combination . The involvement distal lung , i.e . peripheral membranous bronchiole &lt; 2 mm diameter ( so-called small airway ) , pathogenesis asthma extensively investigated significance debate . However , whether specifically target distal lung abnormality lead clinical benefit still open question . In context , interest raise hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) pressurise metered-dose inhaler , deliver compound mass median aerodynamic diameter significantly small available device , lead increase peripheral airway drug deposition . Up 30 % asthmatic patient smoke , mirror rate find general population . Several data document smoking habit negatively affect corticosteroid efficacy asthma . In particular , asthmatic patient smoke experience faster lung function decline , increased frequency exacerbation reduce asthma control despite regularly treat . Several molecular mechanism propose address issue reduce corticosteroid responsiveness smoker patient . However never investigate whether reduce corticosteroid responsiveness asthmatic patient smoke related severe small airway involvement lead impaired distribution impair peripheral deposition inhale corticosteroid . If case , asthmatic patient smoke might benefit pharmacological approach able target reach small airway .</brief_summary>
