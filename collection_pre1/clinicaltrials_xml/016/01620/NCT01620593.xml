	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous cancer men . Patients recurrent metastatic prostate cancer treat androgen-deprivation therapy , often term castration therapy . While short medium term benefit castration clear relation therapeutic efficacy patient prostate cancer , appreciate result hypogonadism associate castration responsible adverse consequence metabolic syndrome include increase body mass index ( BMI ) fat mass , hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia , reduce lean body mass ( LBM ) muscle strength , osteoporosis , sexual dysfunction , poor quality life high cardiovascular mortality . Lower testosterone level men independently predict development metabolic syndrome . Low testosterone level men associate insulin resistance diabetes . Metformin commonly prescribe treatment type II diabetes lower glucose insulin level . Studies show preliminary evidence metformin might antineoplastic chemopreventative activity . Castration therapy decrease insulin sensitivity , adversely alters lipid profile result weight gain , may associate great incidence diabetes cardiovascular disease . Little known optimal strategy mitigate adverse metabolic effect castration men prostate cancer . The rationale use metformin castrate men advance prostate cancer stem observation castration therapy associate metabolic syndrome , hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance . Furthermore , report hyperinsulinemia stimulates insulin receptor expression prostate cancer lead tumor growth development castrate resistant prostate cancer suggest metformin activation AMPK-LKBI pathway reduces liver gluconeogenesis secondarily decrease insulin level may circumvent tumor growth resistance castration therapy . More importantly , evidence metformin inhibits mTOR pathway implicate added therapeutic benefit anti-cancer agent .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>( Eligible subject must meet one inclusion criterion 13 item 46 ) 1 . Men metastatic prostate cancer require castration therapy either use LHRH analogue surgical castration eligible . Complete androgen blockade use antiandrogen therapy prior castration 4 week follow castration therapy permit prevent disease flare . Thereafter antiandrogen therapy may continue discontinue base treat physician preference . OR 2 . Any men prostate cancer candidate castration therapy despite evidence definite metastatic disease include patient biochemical failure 'rising PSA ' also permit enter study provide castration therapy plan minimum year . Patients biochemical failure prior enrolment also already receive appropriate salvage therapy . Men prostate cancer already start castration therapy also permit enter study provide castration therapy initiate within one month study entry . OR 3 . Men prostate cancer previously treat castration therapy management localized prostate cancer adjuvant set combination radiation therapy permit enter study provide currently know metastatic disease noncastrate testosterone level ( Testosterone &gt; 50 ng/dL ) . 4 . An ECOG performance status 02 . 5 . Patients need documentation metastatic disease bone and/or soft tissue , baseline PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml . If patient already castration therapy , baseline PSA value reflective value prior castration . Patients biochemical failure , rise PSA ( baseline PSA need ≥ 5 nglml eligible ) , without metastatic disease also eligible castration therapy indicate minimum 7 month patient PSA value permit . 6 . Patients must provide informed consent , willing blood specimen take , exhibit severe medical psychiatric problem . 1 . Patients severe medical psychiatric disease INELIGIBLE . ( Patients stable chronic disease high cholesterol hypertension ARE eligible . ) Examples problem would make patient INELIGIBLE include severe heart failure , hypoxia due severe lung disease . 2 . Patients clinical biochemical evidence renal failure liver failure INELIGIBLE . Creatinine bilirubin need less equal 1.3~up per limit normal ( ULN ) , ASTIALT le equal 2.5 x ULN unless liver metastasis present 5 X ULN permit ) . 3 . Patients already receive metformin antidiabetic medication INELIGIBLE . 4 . If patient develop symptomatic diabetes require drug therapy , must receive therapy , may include metformin . This must document , patient continue study . 5 . Patients important infection require antibiotic INELIGIBLE , patient acquire minor infection study may remain study . 6 . Alcohol abuse problem make patient INELIGIBLE . Patients need consume less equal 14 unit alcohol weekly . 7 . Patients history evidence lactic acidosis metabolic acidosis exclude .</criteria>
