	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B bleed disease male due low level coagulation factor IX ( FIX ) blood . The major effect health joint disease cause repeated bleeds joint like knee , hip , ankles elbow . Rarely , disease cause death due bleed brain important organ . The current treatment intravenous injection FIX clot factor concentrate , response bleeding . This study focus severe , common type hemophilia B . This study plan use virus call adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) , nature cause disease , engineer deliver human FIX gene ( AAV8-hFIX19 vector ) liver cell , FIX normally make . Medical researcher United States England recently use AAV vector similar one plan study , find single intravenous injection vector , blood level FIX reach level great 1 % , high enough change course disease severe moderate . This mean need take FIX clot factor concentrate decrease , even stop . While important result , need note two six subject receive vector high dos develop inflammation liver . These subject treat steroid medication call Prednisolone , commonly use serious type inflammation . Prednisolone seem decrease liver inflammation , measure decrease blood level elevate liver enzymes , stability FIX level great 1 % normal . This study use AAV8-hFIX19 vector . The vector inject peripheral vein subject , subject hospital . If everything fine , subject discharge hospital next day . Three dos vector ( low , middle , high ) test 15 different subject , depend safety outcome ( determine blood urine test ) result FIX level . If subject develop liver inflammation , short , taper course corticosteroid use .</detailed_description>

Negative viral assay two sample , collect least six month apart , require consider negative . Both natural clearers clear HCV antiviral therapy eligible . Subjects currently antiviral therapy hepatitis B C Subjects significant underlying liver disease , define presence portal hypertension , splenomegaly , varix , ascites , edema , gastrointestinal bleeding , encephalopathy , reduction normal limit serum albumin , prior liver biopsy demonstrate significant fibrosis , specifically ≥ Metavir 3 fibrosis Subjects serological evidence HIV CD4 count ≤ 200/mm3 . Subjects HIVpositive stable , adequate CD4 count ( &gt; 200/mm3 ) undetectable viral load ( &lt; 50 gc/mL ) measure twice six month prior enrollment , antiretroviral drug regimen eligible enroll . History inhibitor FIX AntiAAV8 antibody titer ≥ 1:5 History chronic infection chronic diseases investigator consider constitute unacceptable risk Subjects participate previous gene therapy research trial within one year enrollment Subjects participate clinical study investigational drug within six month enrollment Any condition would allow potential subject complete followup examination course study , opinion investigator , make potential subject unsuitable study</criteria>
