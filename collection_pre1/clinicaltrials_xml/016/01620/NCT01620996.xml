	<brief_title>A Novel Approach Cardiovascular Health Optimizing Risk Management ( ANCHOR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Burden Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain major cause mortality develop world , account almost 40 % death United States Canada . It represent substantial financial drain society contribute significant burden health care system already strain . Major modifiable risk factor CVD include elevate blood pressure , cigarette smoking , elevate total plasma cholesterol low high-density lipoprotein , diabetes , obesity , sedentary lifestyle , least one present 80 % Canadians . Circulatory disease ( particularly heart disease , stroke hypertension ) cost Nova Scotia health care system estimate $ 961 million dollar per year . In Nova Scotia cardiovascular disease kill estimate 2,900 Nova Scotians every year account nearly 36 % deaths province . Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Primary Care Settings There strong evidence link improve risk factor among population improve health outcome , epidemiological community research illustrate bulk non-communicable disease ( NCDs ) CVD preventable , least occurrence postpone . Because primary care physician often first point contact individual need health care , general practice well place facilitate change patient ' risk factor status ensure effective treatment risk factor hypertension hyperlipidemia . Currently primary care service delivery expand include broad network provider nurse , dietician , pharmacist enable effective risk factor identification management , health promotion disease prevention effort across continuum care . Nova Scotia Context Currently Nova Scotia , population health disease prevention initiatives underway support reinforce work current study , include primary health care transition fund initiative , strategic direction Office Health Promotion address major risk factor cardiovascular disease . These provincial initiative together local project ongoing several community provide ideal opportunity interfacing primary care global risk reduction initiative . Study Purpose Design The goal study improve CVD risk primary care adult population , follow primary objective 1 . To improve management global cardiovascular risk patient within two primary care practice , thereby improve overall cardiac health . 2 . To increase patient compliance lifestyle pharmaceutical intervention aim decrease global cardiovascular risk . Secondary objective study : 1 . To examine utility process improve management global cardiovascular risk patient within two primary care practice . 2 . To explore utility process link primary care practice exist community resource order manage cardiac risk factor better among individual within primary care practice . 3 . To determine economic impact global risk assessment management process within primary care set . The intervention lead study coordinator primary care set consist recruitment strategy , global risk factor assessment , behaviour change counseling , risk factor management strategy base 5A 's framework ( ass , advise , agree , assist arrange follow-up ) . Supports provide study participant make behaviour change include counsel follow-up , behaviour change tool , print resource , group education session , inventory link community program . Medication review physician referral also complete require . A Steering Committee guide project include membership Principal Investigators , representative Pfizer Canada , Capital District Health Authority , Cape Breton District Health Authority Nova Scotia Department Health ; community stakeholder include community pharmacy , physician and/or nurse site , relevant ally health professional ( e.g. , nutritionist ) CEO Heart Stroke Foundation Nova Scotia . The initiative conducted three-year period comprise three phase outline follow table . Research Methodology This pre-intervention post-intervention longitudinal , prospective pilot study evaluate study participant achievement CVD risk factor reduction . The research include combination quantitative qualitative data judge effectiveness intervention describe intervention implement . The effectiveness approach examine use pre post measure key outcome variable . In addition outcome measure , process evaluation monitor assess implementation intervention . The study include baseline measurement , periodic assessment process measure , outcome measurement follow-up measurement . Following baseline measurement GRA , patient receive risk management intervention . The data analyze use quantitative qualitative method . Pre post outcome measure analyze use descriptive analytical technique compare mean continuous measure proportion categorical measure . Qualitative data manage analyze either manually via QSR NUD*IST ( Qualitative Solutions Research Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching Theory-building ) software . The qualitative analysis consist content thematic analysis . Sustainability Dissemination The project involve collaboration integration primary health care renewal effort community resource build exist infrastructure thereby help facilitate sustainability . Capacity building within primary care setting mobilization exist resource also help ensure sustainable resource . Steering Committee member partner ensure project result product share organization network , also widely across province . Project finding publish appropriate peer review publication share learn disseminate finding .</detailed_description>
