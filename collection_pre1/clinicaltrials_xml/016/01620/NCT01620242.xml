	<brief_title>A Phase II , Open-Label , Multicenter Trial Cabazitaxel Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer After Failure Of Cisplatin , Cetuximab Taxanes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 week ( D1=D22 ) 6 cycle . In absence progression disease unacceptable toxicity , treatment could continue maximum 10 cycle . Disease response assess every 6 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) clinically CT-scan . An interim analysis carry inclusion first 10 eligible assessable patient .</detailed_description>
