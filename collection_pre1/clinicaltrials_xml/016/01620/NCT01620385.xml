	<detailed_description>Cochlear implant successful restore partial hearing profoundly deaf people . Despite success , implant patient able communicate noisy environment ( e.g. , restaurant ) . Communicating noise still remain one big challenge cochlear implant . Little known factor contribute poor performance CI user noise . In project , propose series experiment aim isolating factor . We propose new program tailor noisy situation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Postlingually deafened adult : 18 year age old Unilateral bilateral Nucleus implant user ( include three generation Nucleus system , i.e. , CI22 , CI24 CI24R ) . With without residual hearing contralateral ear . Subjects may use amplification ( hear aid ) opposite ear implant . A minimum test score 30 % taperecorded openset sentence recognition score ( e.g. , spondee identification ) . Minimum 6 month experience implant device . This do ensure patient familiar hearing sensation perceive cochlear implant . Minimum number active electrode : 10 Minimum number subject test site : 5 2 . Prelingually perilingually deafen adult : 18 year age old Unilateral bilateral Nucleus implant user . With without residual hearing contralateral ear . Subjects may use amplification ( hear aid ) opposite ear implant . A minimum test score 10 % taperecorded openset sentence recognition score ( e.g. , spondee identification ) . Minimum 6 month experience implant device . This do ensure patient familiar hearing sensation perceive cochlear implant . Minimum number active electrode : 10 Minimum number subject test site : 5 NonEnglish speak Hearing loss neural central origin Absence cochlear VIII nerve development The presence systemic condition would preclude use cochlear implant Active middle ear infection/tympanic membrane perforation Significantly abnormal cognitive function , determine case history information and/or clinical observation Significant psychiatric disorder , determine case history information and/or clinical observation</criteria>
