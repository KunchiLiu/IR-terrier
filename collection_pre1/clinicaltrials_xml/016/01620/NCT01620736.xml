	<brief_title>Trial Assess Effect Raltegravir HTLV-1 Proviral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 5 % HTLV-1 infected individual develop lymphoma myelopathy . High level virus replication predictive disease development . HTLV-1 exhibit low level variation HIV-1 , suggest drug resistance less likely occur . Raltegravir show inhibit HTLV-1 integration replication culture use concentration achievable approve dose use HIV-1 infected patient . Currently , treatment recommend asymptomatic infected individual .</detailed_description>
