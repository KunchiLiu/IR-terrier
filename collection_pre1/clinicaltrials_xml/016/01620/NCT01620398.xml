	<brief_summary>There study explore benefit diet compose typical Brazilian food secondary prevention cardiovascular disease . Randomized study show Mediterranean diet beneficial patient establish cardiovascular disease risk CVD development . Indeed , nutritional composition Mediterranean Diet one main reference dietary guideline treatment prevention CVD Brazil world . However , many country , Brazil , food Mediterranean diet widely available , may expensive part population eat habit . So , prescription Mediterranean diet intervention cardiovascular disease Brazilian population may feasible , lead low adherence . In context , patient establish CVD low compliance nutritional prescription . The BALANCE Program , consider 3 concept : ) A dietary prescription guide nutritional content recommendation Brazilian national guideline ; b ) A nutritional education program base fun , playful strategy suggestion affordable food ; c ) Intensive follow-up one-on-one visit , group session , phone call . This first proposal use concept concurrently objective increase adherence secondary prevention patient diet propose guideline . Therefore , trial investigate effect Program reduce cardiovascular event - cardiac arrest , acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , stroke , myocardial revascularization , amputation peripheral arterial disease , hospitalization unstable angina - death patient establish CVD . Moreover , evaluate effect dietary program reduce CV factor , BMI , waist circumference ,</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BALANCE Program investigate effect Program reducing cardiovascular event , cardiac arrest , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , myocardial revascularization , amputation peripheral arterial disease , hospitalization unstable angina , death patient establish cardiovascular disease . Moreover aim evaluate effect dietary program reduce cardiovascular risk factor , body mass index , waist circumference , blood pressure , total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , triglycerides fast glucose . Also objective compare dietary pattern intervention , effect intervention among nutrient energy consumption , finally , evaluate BALANCE Program comprehension . The BALANCE Program randomize , multicenter , national trial allocation concealment intention-to-treat analysis . We randomize patient age 45 year evidence establish cardiovascular disease BALANCE program control group . BALANCE Program compose 3 concept : ) diet provide 50-60 % energy carbohydrate , 10-15 % protein , 25-35 % total fat , &lt; 7 % saturate fatty acid , &lt; 10 % polyunsaturated fatty acid , &lt; 20 % monounsaturated fatty acid , &lt; 1 % trans fat , &lt; 200 mg/day cholesterol , 20-30 g/day fiber , &lt; 2,400 mg/day sodium ; b ) Nutrition education program base ludic strategy indication affordable food ; c ) An intense follow individual group visit phone call . For Control group , generalize advice follow low fat , low energy , low sodium low cholesterol diet give . The primary composite outcome occurrence cardiovascular death , cardiac arrest , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , myocardial revascularization , amputation peripheral arterial disease hospitalization unstable angina . Blinded assessor adjudicate clinical event analysis follow intention-to-treat principle . We enrol 2536 patient 34 site . Enrollment open March 2013 end March 2015 patient follow 48 month .</detailed_description>
