	<brief_summary>End-stage ankle arthritis ( ESAA ) debilitate condition associate severe pain , dysfunction , reduce quality life . Many patient ESAA difficulty walk even 100 foot single flight stair . Patients seek surgery ESAA two primary treatment option : ankle arthrodesis ( i.e. , ankle fusion ) ankle arthroplasty ( i.e. , ankle replacement ) . Few study directly compare effectiveness two procedure , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) perform . The investigator compare follow subject undergo ankle arthrodesis ankle arthroplasty surgery , post-surgery 3 6 month , annual basis ten year . 1 . Overall physical function ankle specific function 2 . Ankle pain intensity interference activity 3 . Activity level 4 . Overall general health 5 . Post-surgical complication rate The investigator also identify prognostic factor predictive high physical function , ankle specific function , reduce pain , improve general health , overall patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From study inception March 2014 , investigator conduct multi-site randomized control trial ( RCT ) compare effectiveness ankle arthrodesis ankle arthroplasty 2-year follow-up period . The study use modify Comprehensive Cohort Design . Subjects unwilling randomize surgery could still participate study enter preference cohort select surgery consultation surgeon . By March 2014 , subject enter randomized cohort . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) recommend stop recruitment randomize arm study since subject willing randomize surgery . All patient enrol preference cohort select arthrodesis arthroplasty . Despite change study design , objectives remain unchanged .</detailed_description>
