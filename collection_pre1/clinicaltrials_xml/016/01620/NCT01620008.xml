	<brief_title>Delayed Cord Clamping Infant Brain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current obstetrical practice birth United States umbilical cord infant clamp immediately . When immediate clamping occurs , 20 40 % fetal-placental blood volume leave behind placenta . This blood contain enough iron-rich red blood cell meet infant 's iron need first 4 6 month life . Delaying cord clamp show increase early iron store without contribute adverse outcome . Early iron sufficiency essential long term neurologic health . Iron deficiency infancy adversely affect cognitive , motor , socio-emotional , behavioral development . Human animal study show inadequate iron store early infancy irreversible negative impact develop brain deficit persist even iron level restore iron supplementation . Iron essential component myelination critical normal brain development function . Myelination , peak first year life , establish maintains efficient communication discrete region brain . Abnormal myelination underlies variety childhood developmental disorder include condition autism . The gap effect increase iron store delay cord clamp myelination neurodevelopment early childhood unknown . Our hypothesis placental transfusion affect myelination early childhood development follow way : 1 ) placental transfusion lead increase blood volume ( BV ) red cell volume ( RCV ) birth ; 2 ) increase RCV result available iron early body iron store ; 3 ) increase body iron store provide essential iron supply optimal myelination ; 4 ) optimal myelination result improve developmental cognitive performance . We propose randomize controlled longitudinal ( birth 24 month ) trial 128 infant measure effect placental transfusion structure function develop brain . We use non-invasive neuroimaging technique measure myelin acquisition time correlate finding iron store developmental outcome . Enrolled woman randomize birth immediate cord clamp group delay cord clamp group . We assess infant iron sufficiency myelin deposition 4 10 month evaluate developmental outcome 4 , 10 , 24 month . This study help establish scientific basis timing cord clamp reference brain development . The innovation study simplicity delay cord clamping combine use new method MRI quantify myelin deposition . This low-tech change clinical practice potential reduce iron deficiency improve developmental outcome . If delay cord clamp demonstrates protective effect optimal development , change practice translate large cost saving improve lifetime productivity beneficial society whole .</detailed_description>
