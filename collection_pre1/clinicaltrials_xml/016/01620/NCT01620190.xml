	<brief_summary>This research study examines use Abraxane ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) patient lung cancer . Abraxane chemotherapy approve treat patient breast cancer . Doctors want know Abraxane safe effective treating patient lung cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate weekly nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation follow front-line therapy EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile weekly nab-paclitaxel patient advance NSCLC EGFR mutation follow front-line therapy EGFR TKI . II . To evaluate time-to-progression overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
