	<brief_summary>The UK Medical Research Council ( MRC ) together Association British Pharmaceutical Industries ( ABPI ) recently fund program design foster collaboration academic COPD researcher pharmaceutical industry UK , aim develop further research capacity expertise benefit patient live prevalent disable condition . This build strong international track record COPD research UK . The program divide four work package ( WP1-4 ) , specific aim . WP1 collate establish data patient cohort share information development knowledge management platform . WP2 specifically assess airway micro-organisms impact COPD effect bacteria virus may modify . WP3 concerned tissue injury repair fundamental process development COPD . WP4 examine detail potential improve patient outcome target skeletal muscle dysfunction profoundly affect exercise capacity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multi-centre UK base observational study cohort patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fund MRC , part MRC/ABPI Inflammation Immunology Initiative COPD . This consortium bring together key researcher COPD research community long-standing expertise understand bacterial infection , inflammation immunity . Understanding role bacterial viral infection , often trigger exacerbation , mechanism tissue re-modelling repair follow exacerbation extremely important . Exacerbations progression disease impose considerable disability patient financial burden health service . In additional , pulmonary inflammation COPD may result systemic inflammation . This associated skeletal muscle dysfunction , well worsen common disease , cardiovascular disease . We much well understand cellular molecular mechanism underlie COPD cause chronic inflammatory process , locally within lung systemically . However , current therapy COPD inadequate relies long-acting bronchodilator , ameliorate underlie chronic inflammatory process . Currently available anti-inflammatory therapy incompletely effective . An improved understanding complex mechanism COPD require order develop future effective treatment , press need . Patients recruit exist cohort COPD patient , indirectly general practitioner outpatient clinic . Patients must COPD , patient assess ensure correct diagnosis . Study patient phenotyped lung morphology function , biomarkers blood , sputum urine , bacterial viral load sputum , cardiovascular behaviour , co-morbidities skeletal muscle function . The patient follow initially 18 month , plan extension 5 year , accurately determine relationship bacterial viral infection , tissue re-modelling skeletal muscle dysfunction exacerbation frequency disease progression . Patients phenotyped : 1 . Chest CT-Scan quantitative measure lung morphology baseline 2 . ECG blood pressure ass cardiovascular risk confer systemic inflammation 4 ) Biomarkers infection , inflammation cardiovascular disease blood , sputum ( spontaneously produce induce ) urine 5 ) Quality life , respiratory symptom , fatigue , depression , history cigarette smoking , housing , contact child pet daily activity assess questionnaire 6 ) A 6 minute walk test 4 meter gait speed determine exercise tolerance disability 7 ) Lung function use spirometer whole body plethymograph 8 ) Arterialised blood gas use ear-lobe blood gas analysis 9 ) Bioimpedance assess blood flow body composition 10 ) Isometric Muscle strength use quadriceps strain gauge Patients ask complete daily diary card record increase two respiratory symptom , identify exacerbation , base validate criterion two consecutive day increase two symptom must include either dyspnoea , sputum purulence sputum volume . Patients unable complete diary card judge incapable take part research . All patient provide inform , write consent . Patients see enrollment , every 6 month thereafter baseline measurement , exacerbation week 2 6 post exacerbation monitor recovery . All patient undergo baseline CT scan , full suspend inspiration small field view include lung . The maximum dose radiation patient receive CT scan estimate 2 milli-Sieverts . This equivalent 100 front chest X ray . This compare average exposure 2 milli-Sieverts per year naturally occur radioactive material ( background radiation ) . Patients may benefit detection previously unknown lung carcinoma lung abnormality . At exacerbation visit , patient may require chest X-ray part standard clinical emergency care e.g . exclude pneumothorax detect pneumonia . The estimate dose radiation per plain chest X-ray 0.02 milli-Sieverts . Blood test take trained personnel . The blood analyse routine haematological parameter , body chemical might link COPD , ischaemic heart disease co-morbridities . The volume blood take cause anaemia routine blood count make monitor haemoglobin level . Both spontaneous induce sputum specimens take . The induced sputum may cause cough shortness breath . Patients closely monitor lung function check ensure safety . We previously show induced sputum sample safe procedure COPD . Patients ask walk 6 minute distance record . Patients heart rate oxygen saturation monitor walk . Patients may experience shortness breath test . Supplementary oxygen available patient desaturates test . Additional assessment muscle strength disability carry use quadriceps strain gauge , four meter gait speed test short physical performance battery . The patient experience dyspnoea would normally encounter everyday life quadriceps strain gauge perform underlying musculoskeletal neurological contra-indications . Some investigation describe specific certain centre collaborate study test perform patient . The test request individual patient fully explain initial visit appropriate study site .</detailed_description>
