	<brief_summary>This study compare efficacy low high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) mean treating subject schizophrenia . Magnetic pulse deliver scalp cause brain activity . This activity show help decrease intensity frequency auditory hallucination ( AH ) schizophrenia . The investigator compare whether low high frequency work best . The investigator also examine change occur brain related improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . The sub-Investigator Dr. Mennemeier use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) treat phantom sound perception subject tinnitus . The Principal Investigator ( PI ) , Dr. Messias , aim team Drs . Mennemeier James , learn rTMS influence phantom sound perception schizophrenia . rTMS already show effective treatment tinnitus schizophrenia . rTMS non-invasive method regional brain stimulation significantly reduce phantom sound perception temporarily 50 % subject tinnitus schizophrenia . This study go previous investigation analyze different frequency rTMS influence auditory hallucination ( AH ) schizophrenia also brain connectivity schizophrenia . The investigator want learn rTMS decrease AH normalize brain connectivity . Whereas study focus schizophrenic subject AH , design similar ongoing work tinnitus finding comparable . Tinnitus AH schizophrenia prevalent disable disorder sound perception . The investigator understand precise mechanism disorder lack . Interestingly , symptoms disorder respond positively rTMS temporal cortex way defy contemporary understanding nature symptom rTMS work improve . For example , phantom sound perception tinnitus schizophrenia link maladaptive , hyperactivity auditory processing region temporal cortex ; however , increasingly clear pathological change alone insufficient explain pronounce intrusiveness negative emotional valance symptom disorder . Therefore , barrier understand disorder lie understanding change auditory cortex synchronize change cortical region regulate perception emotion . Additionally , present , decision rTMS frequency apply treatment phantom sound perception firm theoretical empirical basis . Whereas , low frequency rTMS traditionally use , base upon contemporary model , `` inhibit '' hyperactivity auditory cortex ; high frequency rTMS , induce opposite effect neuronal processing , work improve symptom may effective subject low frequency rTMS . Therefore , contemporary model design explain frequency rTMS influence neuronal activity immediate follow stimulation insufficient explain low high frequency rTMS mitigate phantom sound perception day , week month follow single course treatment . Hypothesis . The investigator propose phantom sound perception schizophrenia result imbalance excitatory inhibitory neural process auditory network synchronize , maladaptive change link brain region regulate perception emotion . Treating auditory cortex repetitive , external magnetic stimulation decrease phantom sound perception distress reverse maladaptive brain reorganization set motion underlie neural imbalance .</detailed_description>
