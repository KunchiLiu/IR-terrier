	<brief_summary>This study design ass : Hypothesis # 1 : That significant central pain component distinct subset patient diagnose knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) , Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) , painful diabetic neuropathy ( PDN . ) Hypothesis # 2 : To establish reliable strategy differentiation central pain predominant peripheral pain predominant knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) , chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) peripheral diabetic neuropathy ( PDN ) patient use clinical feature , experimental pain test magnetic resonance ( MR ) Spectroscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study identify clinical neuroimaging marker chronic pain effort provide individual-based treatment . This study differentiate chronic pain subject ( knee osteoarthritis , low back pain painful diabetic neuropathy ) two group : central pain predominant symptom peripheral pain predominant symptom . The response medical treatment two group quite different , thus reliable strategy correctly categorize chronic pain sufferer offer opportunity provide target , effective treatment . Chronic pain prevalent problem VA veteran population significant associate cost ; particular knee osteoarthritis , chronic low back pain painful diabetic neuropathy common population . The propose study use different clinical pain test advance neuroimaging technique improve understand chronic pain improve patient outcome .</detailed_description>
