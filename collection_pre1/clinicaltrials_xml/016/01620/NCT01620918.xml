	<brief_summary>- Baseline : - Standard preparation osteotomy - Placement 2 dental implant - On implant one type heal abutment place - Suturing - Standardized radiography measure bone-levels baseline - Digital impression surround gingiva intra-oral scanner ( non-invasive method ) measure baseline level gingiva - 2 week Baseline : Removal suture - 4 week Baseline : - A 2nd digital impression soft tissue intra-oral scanner - Collecting crevicular fluid place paperpoints provide aperture heal abutment 60 second without bleed . - Measuring pocket depth provide aperture heal abutment automate probe . - Removal Healing Abutment attach soft tissue en-bloque . - Placement new , regular , Encode Healing Abutment . - 10 week Baseline : - Start standard prosthetic procedure . In study expect soft tissue attachment ( i.e . gingival attachment ) strong earlier achieve nano-structured healing abutment normal , uncoated healing abutment . This would lead stable soft tissue complex long rung thus provide predictable aesthetic outcome . Secondly , strong attachment would mean strong barrier micro-organism might influence occurrence peri-implantitis .</brief_summary>
