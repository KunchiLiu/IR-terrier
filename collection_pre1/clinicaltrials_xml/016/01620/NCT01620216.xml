	<brief_title>Targeted Therapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity kinase inhibitor use pre-clinical ( in-vitro ) activity select individual therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall objective response rate ( complete response plus partial response ) . II . Determine overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . Any change transfusion requirement . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Prioritize active/aberrant kinase pathway use vitro inhibitor screen use individual primary leukemia sample . II . Measure `` target '' vivo kinase inhibition signal transducer activator transcription ( STAT ) -5 phosphorylation correlate response treatment . III . Perform next generation sequencing ( whole exome sequence ) complete mutational analysis . IV . Identify aberrant gene expression primary leukemia sample study subject . V. Evaluate pharmacokinetics individual kinase inhibitor therapy . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 5 treatment group base pre-clinical kinase inhibitor activity . GROUP I : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II : Patients receive nilotinib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP III : Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP IV : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP V : Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
