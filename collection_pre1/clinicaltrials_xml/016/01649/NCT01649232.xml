	<brief_summary>In present study aim examine whether transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) generate excitability change induce modification functional cortical architecture Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) patient . To achieve , investigator use event-related potential ( ERP ) analysis base 20 channel EEG recording ADHD subject bipolar tDCS-anode stimulation F3/F4 T5/T6 P4/P3 , rest state measure clinical score visual CPT task change . Time course topography independent component visual ERPs compare tDCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADHD Electrophysiological Subtypes Implications Transcranial Direct-current Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Important advance understand ADHD pathophysiology , fMRI study show focal frontotemporal loop dysfunction brain activity , suggest frontal brain stimulation might helpful treatment ADHD . In recent study Lyon 's university tDCS conclude tDCS `` cheap easier-use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) impact symptomatology seem large ( impact negative symptom schizophrenic patient ) long ( least 3 month duration ) TMS currently permit . It possible tDCS could future use home patient . The efficacy tDCS depend parameter like electrode position current strength . In trial , The investigator investigate effect 12 day anodal stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ten patient ADHD ( age 8 +/- 3 year ) . tDCS apply saline-soaked pair surface sponge electrode ( 35 cm2 ) . The anode electrode place F3/F4 T5/T6 P4/P3 ( base 10-20 International EEG System ) subject . The cathode place contralateral mastoid area . A constant current 1.1 2.0 mA apply 25 min/day ( administer 12 alternated day ) . Prior first session , ADHD subject ask complete return series questionnaire , include Conners Brief Symptom Inventory , health history questionnaire , QEEG questionnaire . Subjects test first session last approximately three hour . During period , comprehensive structure clinical interview carry , comprise assessment current past ADHD symptom , history problem school , past psychiatric history ( include drug medication use ) , well past present comorbidities . Subsequently , EEG data acquire . EEG data first record subject eyes-closed eyes-open resting condition , last four minute . Then data record subject perform visual continuous performance task ( VCPT ) . The VCPT take approximately 22 minute complete . In addition , subject randomly perform either auditory emotional continuous performance task . The control group shorten procedure . Subjects test single session last approximately two half hour . During period , series questionnaire ( Brief Symptom Inventory , Health History questionnaire , Current Symptoms Scales ) fill thereafter , EEG data acquire . Subsequently , work memory task , relevant , administer . EEG record use Mitsar 201 19-channel electroencephalographic system . The input signal reference link ear filter 0.5 50 Hz digitize sample rate 250 Hz . Impedance keep 5 kOhm electrode . Electrodes place accord International 10-20 system use electrode cap . Quantitative data calculate use WinEEG software . Linked ear reference montage change average reference montage prior data processing . Eye-blink artefact correct zero activation curve individual ICA component score respond eye blink . In addition , epochs filter electroencephalogram excessive amplitude ( &gt; 100 μV ) and/or excessive fast ( &gt; 35 μV 20 35 Hz band ) slow ( &gt; 50 μV 0 1 Hz band ) activity automatically mark excluded analysis . Finally , EEG manually inspect verify artefact removal . Behavioral task The VCPT modification visual two-stimulus GO/NOGO paradigm . Three category visual stimulus select : 20 picture animal , 20 picture plant , 20 picture human ( present together artificial `` novel '' sound ) . The trial consist presentation pair stimulus : animal-animal ( GO trial ) , animal-plant ( NOGO trial ) , plant-plant ( IGNORE trial ) , plant-human ( NOVEL trial ) . The trial group four block . In block unique set five animal stimulus , five plant stimulus five human stimulus select . Each block consist pseudo-random presentation 100 stimuli pair equal probability trial category . The task press button fast possible response GO trial . According task design , two preparatory set distinguish trial . In `` Continue set '' picture animal present first stimulus subject suppose prepare respond . In `` Discontinue set '' picture plant present first stimulus subject need prepare respond . During task , subject seat comfortable chair , 1.5 front computer screen . The stimulus present 17 inch monitor use Psytask ( Mitsar Ltd. ) software . The primary outcome change score QEEG Rating Scale ( AMEN questionnaire ) . The ERP questionnaire/behavioural assessment make baseline ( stimulation ) 3 month stimulation . This study involve 30 subject , age 7 13 . All diagnose ADHD medical professional .</detailed_description>
