	<brief_summary>This study involve use enrich hematopoetic stem cell infusion ( stem cell , produce bone marrow ) donor provide original kidney transplant . This kidney transplant may take place month year previously .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Tolerance Recipients Living Kidney Allografts Donor FCRx Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve use combination enrich hematopoetic stem cell infusion ( stem cell , produce bone marrow , generate cell form blood element , help fight infection assist clot ) kidney transplantation donor try avoid need long-term anti-rejection drug therapy . The desired result study allow body develop `` tolerance '' transplant kidney . Tolerance mean body would see transplanted kidney part try get rid , reject . To prevent rejection , drug call immunosuppressive agent must take daily basis . The purpose study determine procedure safe try substantially reduce even eliminate need anti-rejection medication .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient receive renal transplant The original donor patient must willing participate study meet donor eligibility criterion Patient must age 18 65 year The crossmatch negative donor recipient within 30 day infusion Potential recipient woman child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour prior receive Granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) agree use reliable contraception 1 year follow infusion Potential donor woman child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour prior receive GCSF No evidence donorspecific antibody presently historically Panel Reactive Antibody ( PRA ) less equal 20 % within 30 day FCRx infusion Note : The subject need local resident order eligible trial , must willing reside area , within four hour drive , first month protocol monitor closely early post stem cell transplant period . As long insurance funding cover cost stem cell transplant research related complication , necessary subject US citizens participate trial . Clinically active bacterial , fungal , viral parasitic infection Pregnancy Clinical serologic evidence viral infection would preclude recipient receive infusion Previous radiation therapy dose would preclude Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) Positive crossmatch donor recipient Evidence immunologic memory donor Body Mass Index ( BMI ) great 35 less 18 Positive serology Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Uncontrolled concomitant infection unstable medical condition could interfere study objective . Patients impaired organ function , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less 35 % forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , forced expiratory volume ( FEV ) , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) less 50 % , transaminases great 4 time upper limit normal excluded participation . Biopsy proven rejection episode . Insufficient fund bone marrow processing cost</criteria>
