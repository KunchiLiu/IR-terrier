	<brief_summary>Patients pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) suffer breathlessness , poor quality life inability function , despite medical therapy Current consensus state combination therapy different class PAH-specific therapy likely bring additional benefit PAH patient . In study plan study exercise performance change phosphodiesterase inhibitor vardenafil add patient remain symptomatic PAH treat inhaled iloprost . Following baseline assessment , Patients start vardenafil 10 mg bid . If drug tolerate patient , two week period , titration 20 mg bid permit , discretion investigator . According treatment protocol titration do carefully whenever side effect report titration stop dosage decrease stop accord investigator judgment . Systemic BP measure baseline assessment . The patient attend clinic first dose monitoring ( 10 mg ) titration study drug 20 mg . Systemic BP measure baseline assessment . The patient attend clinic first dose monitoring ( 10 mg ) titration study drug 20 mg. A fall SBP &gt; 30 mmHg consider significant small value discretion investigator . BP measure accord follow protocol . Pre-dose Immediately administration vardenafil . This time approximately one hour prior next plan dose iloprost . Pre-inhalation One hour post vardenafil dose , immediately prior iloprost inhalation . Post-inhalation Immediately follow completion iloprost inhalation every fifteen minute one hour . Prior discharge Two hour follow iloprost . Later monitor At follow-up visit , BP measure . This open-label study evaluate safety efficacy add high dos vardenafil inhale iloprost 3 month .</brief_summary>
