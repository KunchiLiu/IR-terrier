	<brief_summary>The whole body vibration offer well treatment adherence among elderly , minimize effort additional stress cardiovascular system skeletal muscle compare conventional exercise program . Hypothesis : Patients COPD undergoing training program whole body vibration show good performance 6MWT improvement muscle strength .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Body Vibration Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In elderly COPD patient weight loss include sarcopenia , result age due disuse disease state associate represent reduction muscle mass , lead decreased strength endurance , repercussion functional ability . It reduce power muscle strength age represent decrease carry daily physical task . In COPD , exacerbation worsen loss muscle mass , affect respiratory peripheral muscle , exercise capacity survival rate , case severe malnutrition advance case disease , implication state disability occur 10-15 % mild obstruction 25 % moderate severe obstructive associate bad prognosis . The whole body vibration could efficient combination train method elderly patient base generation sinusoidal vibration offer platform , stimulate muscle spindle result activation neuron Î± engine develop muscle contraction , present alternative conventional treatment muscular endurance well improve physical fitness</detailed_description>
