	<brief_summary>The purpose study see use device call Jaw Dynasplint® System use immediately cancer treatment . The Dynasplint® stretching device use treat joint stiffness limit range motion jaw . The device currently approve treatment trismus develop . This study investigate use device immediately cancer treatment prevent trismus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Dynasplint Prevent Trismus Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data suggest early intervention mechanical stretch device head neck cancer patient undergo curative therapy maximize effectiveness treatment trismus . That say , treatment trismus typically begin head neck cancer patient find moderate severe reduction jaw range motion . Typically , clinician begin therapy IID 3.0 cm less . A subset head neck cancer patient develop severe rapidly progressive trismus fail respond treatment . In cohort , trismus may lead permanent , severe morbidity . It may hypothesize preventative strategy encourage routine stretch immediately completion cancer therapy may prevent minimize trismus . No study examine prophylactic use Jaw Dynasplint® System cancer treatment . Furthermore , know whether patient tolerate wear mechanical stretch device treatment . The investigator would like test hypothesis : 1 ) preventive use mechanical stretching device cancer treatment early recovery feasible , 2 ) preventive use mechanical stretching device result mark decrease incidence severity trismus patient undergoing primary adjuvant radiation therapy head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
