	<brief_title>A Clinical Study With Tremelimumab Monotherapy Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No effective standard treatment improve significantly prognosis malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) patient . However , evidence MM patient may benefit immunotherapeutic agent . Clinical study examine CTLA-4 blockade provide convincing evidence immunobiological effect clinical activity new class immunomodulating therapeutic agent , likely due ability stimulate patients'immune system effectively attack tumor cell block negative regulatory signal . Tremelimumab fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , develop IgG2 isotype minimize complement activation reduce risk cytokine storm . As single agent , Tremelimumab induce durable tumor regression 7-10 % patient advanced melanoma . Tremelimumab test several clinical trial single-agent combination agent different solid tumor . The evidence unveil strong immunologic potential treatment Tremelimumab also MM patient .</detailed_description>
