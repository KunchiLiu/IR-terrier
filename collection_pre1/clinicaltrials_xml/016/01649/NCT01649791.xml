	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study lenalidomide chemoprevention treat patient high-risk , early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) . Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming . The use lenalidomide may slow disease progression patient early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Chemoprevention Treating Patients With High-Risk , Early-Stage B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression patient high risk CLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall response rate include ( complete remission [ CR ] +partial remission [ PR ] ) lenalidomide . II . To determine incidence immune mediate flare reaction . III . To characterize toxicity profile single agent lenalidomide previously untreated B-CLL . IV . To correlate expression B-CLL co-stimulatory ligands clinical efficacy lenalidomide patient population . V. To conduct correlative study . OUTLINE : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
