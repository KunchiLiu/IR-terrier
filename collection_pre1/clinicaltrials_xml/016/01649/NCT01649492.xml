	<detailed_description>For ovarian cancer , colorectal gastric cancer present peritoneal metastasis , complete tumor removal surgery important independent prognostic factor . Consequently , accurate detection tumor often compromise resectability , like extra-abdominal metastasis , liver metastasis , portal superior mesenteric artery deposit extensive intestinal serosal invasion pivotal prior treatment selection . Computed tomography ( CT ) variable accuracy staging , due difficult detection low-contrast small-sized peritoneal nodal metastasis . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ( FDG-PET/CT ) improve detection thoraco-abdominal lymphadenopathy liver metastasis , inconsistently detect small ( &lt; 5mm ) peritoneal metastasis . Therefore diagnostic staging laparoscopy general anesthesia currently necessary standard clinical practice addition image assessment operability . Whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image research department radiology , University Hospitals Leuven collaboration department abdominal surgery , oncologic surgery , oncologic gynaecology digestive oncology . The technique hold high promise combine high accuracy systemic thoraco-abdominal stag peritoneal assessment operability . Technological progress enable time-efficient WB-DWI thin-slice-acquisition multiplanar image reformatting . DWI depict lesion measure water diffusion difference , correlate cellular density . Tumors depict high signal compare background combine short-T1-inversion-time inversion recovery ( STIR ) prepulse - suppressing ascites , blood vessel , fat , bowel visceral organ - heavy diffusion weight . However , due contraction mucosal cellularity , bowel wall show increase signal-intensity ( SI ) , hamper detection serosal deposit . This overcome suppressing contraction intravenous antispasmodic distend bowel wall suppress signal bowel content peroral pineapple juice show negative contrast property due manganese-content . In first pilot study ovarian cancer center 32 patient , accuracy detection intestinal serosal metastases 90 % reach WB-DWI combined peroral pineapple juice . As , pineapple juice play pivotal role peroral contrast addition WB-DWI accurate peritoneal stag . To date , inhibitory potential pineapple juice cytochrome P450 2C9 activity describe vitro human microsome . In model , diclofenac metabolite 4-OH-diclofenac use probe CYP2C9 activity , show pineapple juice capable inhibit CYP2C9 potently ( IC50 0.08 % ) irreversible manner . It suggest main effect cause bromelain , 24-26 kDa cysteine protease enzyme present pineapple juice . The intestinal absorption intact bromelain oral intake describe 19 healthy men , surprise adult intestinal epithelium traditionally describe non-permeable protein . The ( limited ) absorption think occur via paracellular route , could explain catalytic activity bromelain preserve following absorption blood circulation . Although effect bromelain CYP2C9 activity expect vivo ( due low oral bioavailability ) , vivo trial undertaken elucidate pineapple juice , specifically bromelain , capable inhibit intestinal , importantly , hepatic CYP2C9 clinically relevant manner . The vivo inhibitory profile CYP2C9 pineapple juice evaluate study 10 healthy volunteer , examine impact area-under-the-curves ( AUCs ) diclofenac metabolite 4-OH diclofenac .</detailed_description>
