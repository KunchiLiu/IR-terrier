	<detailed_description>Upon enrollment , define informed consent sign confirm eligibility , study subject randomize , diagnosis congenital CMV confirm , six week oral valganciclovir six week oral placebo . Study subject stratify accord age randomization ( 1 11 month , 12 23 month , 24 through35 month , great equal 36 month ) accord country enrollment ( U.S. U.K. ) . The sample size randomize evaluable subject 54 . Dropouts subject audiology assessment inadequate study comparison replace ( 20 % , n=10 ) . During six week treatment period , study subject follow every 2 week . Subjects also see approximately one month follow final dose ( Study Day 70 ) , Study Months 4 6 . At visit treatment phase ( Study Days 1 , 14 , 28 , 42 ) , safety lab assess ; viral load specimen blood , urine , saliva obtain ; adverse event assess ; concurrent medication record . Ganciclovir concentration population pharmacokinetic assessment obtain study visit subject receive study medication . Dose adjustment weight change occur study visit subject 's treatment period , may also occur time treatment period indicate per protocol neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , renal impairment . At Study Day 70 visit , safety lab obtain ; viral load specimen blood , urine , saliva obtain ; adverse event assess . Hearing assessed baseline Study Month 6 . Changes whole blood viral load measurement correlate hear outcome . In study subject increase whole blood viral load course treatment , antiviral resistance may evaluate .
