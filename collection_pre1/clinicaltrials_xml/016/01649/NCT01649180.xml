	<brief_summary>The purpose study see well study drug , axitinib , help control renal ( kidney ) cancer come back ( recurrent ) spread ( metastatic ) . Patients must already treat participant clinical trial sunitinib , sorafenib , pazopanib placebo ( sugar pill ) initial surgery . This study examine effect adjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibition ( TKI ) therapy ( sorafenib , sunitinib pazopanib ) subsequent exposure TKI axitinib first-line recurrent metastatic setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NEXT : Subsequent Exposure Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Recurrence After Adjuvant Therapy Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 64,770 case cancer involve kidney renal pelvis diagnose United States 2012 13,570 death occur tumor . The rate Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) increase 2 % per year past 65 year . The reason increase unknown smoke obesity risk factor development RCC . Early stage disease typically treated resection definitive intent partial radical nephrectomy . Patients metastatic disease often treat systemic therapy palliative intent . Systemic therapeutic option include so-called targeted therapy , less often chemotherapy immunomodulatory therapy ( interferon alpha interleukin-2 ) . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve six targeted agent treatment advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma fall two general class - vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) . On basis several randomized phase III study , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR2 ) inhibitor therapy become generally preferred treatment recurrent metastatic ccRCC ( clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma ) first-line set . Treatment ccRCC VEGF-inhibition first-line metastatic setting , associate progression-free survival approximately 11 month . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor therapy second-line remains active , less degree - progression-free survival ( PFS ) report 5 7 month . Adjuvant treatment high-risk , early-stage ccRCC VEGFR2 TKI therapy follow definitive resection become area active investigation . The ASSURE trial ( ECOG 2805 ) recently complete accrual , adjuvant trial - . ) SORCE ( sorafenib 3 1 year versus placebo ) , ii . ) S-Trac ( sunitinib versus placebo ) - accrual . Axitinib ( AG-013736 , Pfizer Inc. ) , receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective VEGFR1 , 2 , 3 , important new agent use metastatic RCC . Axitinib examine extensively RCC , show safe , well-tolerated , highly active . On January 27 , 2012 , FDA approve axitinib treatment advance RCC failure one prior systemic therapy .</detailed_description>

Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . No clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality No current use anticipate need tx drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor No current anticipate need tx drug know CYP3A4 CYP1A2 inducers No current requirement anticoagulant therapy oral vitamin K antagonists No untreated brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . Patients must oral ( systemic ) steroid prior registration . Inhalational steroid , e.g. , asthma , emphysema permissible . No serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability receive study tx None follow condition within 6 month prior study drug : myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism No known HIV AIDSrelated illness No active malignancy No dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol No severe acute/chronic medical psychiatric condition lab abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study</criteria>
