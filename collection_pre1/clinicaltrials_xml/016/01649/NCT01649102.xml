	<detailed_description>The use tunnel cuffed catheter ( TCCs ) vascular access discourage NKF DOQI guideline , propensity infection , thrombosis , inadequate and/or irregular blood flow rate damage large central vein . In addition , emerge data suggest link catheter use cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Nevertheless , still frequently use hemodialysis population , either documented inadequate vascular access anatomy , bridge functional permanent access . A large number TCC available , mainly differ respect material type , lumen diameter design , tip design , well presence design side hole . There currently prove advantage one long-term catheter design another . The design catheter tip may affect propensity thrombosis hence intraluminal infection , well percentage recirculation , especially arterial venous blood tubing reverse . Commonly use catheter stagger tip design , mean outflow tip extend several centimetre ( typically minimum 2.5 cm ) beyond inflow tip , prevent recirculation . Other designs split tip , symmetrical tip . In latter type , use Palindrome® ( Covidien ) catheter , spiral separator incorporate allow either lumen use arterial port . Many catheter multiple side hole , decrease shear rate increase flow arterial side reflect belief backup inflow necessary case obstruction . However , side hole also promote thrombosis infection due irregularity cut surface . Especially distal side hole comprise low flow zone increase clot risk . The Palindrome® ( Covidien ) catheter laser cut side hole , think smoother surface lower tendency cause thrombosis . Inadequate blood flow catheter often mend reversal inlet outlet lumen . However , reversal flow lead substantial increase recirculation ( 2 % -3 % 10 % ) , affect efficiency treatment . It therefore never use except temporarily problem definitively correct . The symmetrical tip design Palindrome® ( Covidien ) catheter allow lumen reversal without increase recirculation . The present randomized control trial ( RCT ) design evaluate chronic hemodialysis patient performance two TCC different design : Palindrome® ( Covidien ) , symmetrical spiral z-tip catheter make carbothane Hemoglide® ( Bard ) , 3 cm stagger tip make polyurethane .</detailed_description>
