	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate efficacy alternative surgical technique use fibrin sealant prevent post-operative seroma formation . A seroma build-up clear bodily fluid place body tissue remove surgery . Seromas happen breast surgery . Seromas appear 7 10 day surgery , drainage tube remove . The breast area involve surgery may spot 's swollen feel like liquid skin</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate differ surgical technique ( sharp dissection v. electrosurgical , use fibrin glue ) latissimus dorsi donor flap harvest effect , prevention post-operative seromas . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo sharp dissection technique fibrin sealant closure . ARM II : Patients undergo standard electrocoagulation dissection technique . After completion study treatment , patient follow 90-180 day .</detailed_description>

Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients qualify latissimus dorsi donor flap reconstruction base anatomical limitation specific subject respectively ; evaluate plastic surgeon History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fibrin glue sealant Patients evidence hematological disorder result deficient coagulation whereby sharp dissection would result undesirable bleeding otherwise perform safely electrosurgery</criteria>
