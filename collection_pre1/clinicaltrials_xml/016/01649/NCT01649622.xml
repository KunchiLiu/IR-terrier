	<brief_title>Bendamustine Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Patient receive bendamustine vein 30 minute twice day Days 1-4 every study cycle . The length study cycle depend disease responds study drug . Each cycle last 3 10 week . Study Visits : Before cycle , patient physical exam , include measurement vital sign . One ( 1 ) time week , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . These blood draw longer draw every week point disease appear get well . After , blood drawn every 2-4 week patient receive study drug . These blood draw perform doctor near patient result report study doctor . On Day 21 Cycle 1 , every 4 week , patient bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . If patient 's doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy may collect less often , depend status disease . Length Treatment : Patient may receive 12 cycle study drug . Patient take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , study doctor think patient 's best interest . Patient 's participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-up Visits : Patient ask return clinic every 3 6 month 5 year stop receive study drug . Patient ask side effect symptom may . If patient unable return MD Anderson , follow-up visit may conduct phone . Each call last 5 minute . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) also draw routine test every 4-8 week follow-up period . This investigational study . Bendamustine FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
