	<detailed_description>Oral feed issue preterm infant grow concern neonatologists difficulty preterm infant show transition tube independent oral feed lead delay hospital discharge , maternal stress rise financial burden . Safety infant oral feeding implies minimal risk aspiration require adequate coordination sucking , swallow respiration . Sucking swallow present early foetal life , coordination suck swallow breathe think occur 34 week post-menstrual age ( PMA ) . Thus , preterm infant tend suck , swallow breathe alternate , rather coordinated fashion . Accelerated maturation suck reflex early readiness bottle-feeding report preterm neonate give non-nutritive sucking ( NNS ) opportunities gavage feeding . Recent evidence suggest sensory consequence associate production NNS beneficial effect oral feed performance development specific suck skill . At present , customary infant stable cardiopulmonary status introduce oral feeding around 33 34 week PMA . They usually take day week transition period combine gavage oral feeding reach full oral feeding . Recent study suggest oral stimulation program associate NNS apply preterm infant least 10 day period full gavage feed facilitate oral feeding progress , improve breastfeed rate among preterm infant decrease length stay . A meta-analysis find NNS decrease significantly length hospital stay preterm infant acceleration transition tube bottle feed well bottle feeding performance , without negative outcome report . Actually , neonatal intensive care unit , preterm infants n't receive oral stimulation pacifier develop NNS oral feed introduction show frequently , even infant bear 32 week ' gestational age , difficulty transition tube independent oral feeding . In prospective randomize control clinical trial , prefeeding oral stimulation compare conventional approach oral feeding initiation . Considering 15 day follow-up patient introduction oral feeding , expect rate patient perform full oral feed 15 day 95 % stimulate group 70 % non stimulate group , minimal sample size need observe difference two group would 37 patient group power 80 % alpha level 5 % . A total 74 preterm infant go include neonatal intensive care unit Children 's Hospital Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg , Luxembourg . The investigator go include preterm infant 26 33+6 week ' gestational age , determine date last menstruation first-trimester ultrasound . Prior inform consent go obtain parents/guardians newborns participation study . Infants ' randomization , experimental control group , go do reach 32 week PMA infant bear 32 week , birth infant bear 32 week ' gestational age . The process do use sequential number , keep seal , opaque , non-translucid envelope . Randomization go stratify base gestational age range ( 26-27+6 , 28-29+6 , 30-31+6 , 32-33+6 ) ensure similar gestational age distribution two group . Infants interventional group go receive prefeeding oral stimulation ( group 1 ) , infant control group ( group 2 ) neither stimulate propose pacifier gavage feeding . The intervention start 32 week PMA medically stable infant feed gavage feed infant born 32 week ' gestational age , , soon clinical stability acquire , infant bear 32 week . The investigator define complete oral feeding minimal quantity 5 millilitre preterm infant drink le 10 minute bottle breastfeed . These 5 millilitre usual quantity preterm baby bear 34 week ' gestational age able drink meal . The program go interrupted infant medically unstable and/or episode oxygen desaturation , apnoea and/or bradycardia intervention . Gavage feed begin preterm infant clinically stable term hemodynamics present peristalsis accord criterion establish caretaker staff . Oral diet progress depend infant 's tolerance 20 ml/kg/day . The change gavage oral feeding go initiated 34 week PMA , begin oral stimulation program group 1 . The gavage feeding stop orogastric tube remove , infant attain oral feeding volume 120 ml/kg/day . A weight lose 5 % authorized stopping gavage feeding . Full oral diet define oral intake milk &gt; 150 ml/kg/day , bottle breastfeeding , 3 consecutive day . The expected benefit study reduction length stay neonatal unit stimulate group , due reduction length transition period preterm infant . A minimisation hospitalization cost reduction parental stress expect earlier hospital discharge . An increase breastfeeding rate discharge expect . With improved feeding performance stimulate group , maternal stress concern breastfeeding reduce risk failure small . A good mother-child attachment expect study .</detailed_description>
