	<brief_title>Studying Physical Function Quality Life Before After Surgery Patients With Stage I Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine change non-radical surgical treatment ( simple hysterectomy cone biopsy [ fertility preservation ] ) pelvic lymphadenectomy ) functional outcome bladder , bowel , sexual function stage IA1 ( lymphatic vessel invasion positive [ LVSI+ ] ) IA2-IB1 ( = &lt; 2 cm ) carcinoma cervix . II . To evaluate incidence severity lymphedema non-radical surgery ( simple hysterectomy cone biopsy [ fertility preservation ] pelvic lymphadenectomy ) stage IA1 ( LVSI+ ) IA2-IB1 ( = &lt; 2 cm ) carcinoma cervix . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate non-radical surgery ( simple hysterectomy cone biopsy [ fertility preservation ] pelvic lymphadenectomy ) demonstrate great physical function less toxicity comparison historical data radical surgery ( radical hysterectomy radical trachelectomy ) . II . To evaluate incidence severity treatment-related adverse event , include surgical complication , among entire cohort treatment type . III . To evaluate change quality life ( QOL ) ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cervix [ FACT-Cx ] ) , cancer worry ( Impact Events Scale [ IES ] ) sexual ( Female Sexual Function Index [ FSFI ] ) /reproductive concern ( RCS ) among entire cohort treatment type . IV . To explore relationship ( correlation , interaction , independence ) functional outcome ( i.e. , bladder function , bowel function , sexual function ) , adverse event ( include surgical complication lymphedema [ Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire ( GCLQ ) ] ) , cancer worry ( IES ) , surgical complication , overall quality life ( FACT-Cx ) . V. To determine participant ' intention conception &amp; fertility rate ( Integrative Care Fertility [ ICF ] ) assess reproductive concern ( RCS ) woman follow cone biopsy pelvic lymphadenectomy stage IA1 ( LVSI+ ) IA2-IB1 ( = &lt; 2 cm ) carcinoma cervix . VI . To estimate efficacy non-radical surgery ( simple hysterectomy cone biopsy [ fertility preservation ] pelvic lymphadenectomy ) stage IA1 ( LVSI+ ) IA2-IB1 ( = &lt; 2 cm ) carcinoma cervix . OUTLINE : Patients undergo cone biopsy pelvic lymphadenectomy simple hysterectomy pelvic lymphadenectomy . Patients complete FACT-Cx , IES , FSFI , GCLQ , Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) questionnaires baseline , 4-6 week surgery , every 6 month 3 year . Patients undergo cone biopsy pelvic lymphadenectomy also complete ICF RCS questionnaire . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
