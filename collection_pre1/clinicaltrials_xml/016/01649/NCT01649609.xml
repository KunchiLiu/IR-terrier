	<brief_summary>BK virus infection kidney transplant increase result damage transplant kidney . Currently , universally accept treatment decrease strength antirejection medication unclear medication lower extent . The investigator propose perform study patient BK virus detect blood routine screening appear increase . The investigator use two different strategy involve different combination standard anti-rejection medication low dosage . Patients assign one two group random manner across two hospital participate study .

	<brief_title>Using mTOR Inhibitors Prevention BK Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence BK viremia , early complication renal transplantation associate rate graft loss result BK nephropathy steadily rise since series case report mid-1990 's . While least partly related introduction newer immunosuppressive agent , recent United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) data analyse suggest continue rise incidence BK viremia associate nephropathy 3.5 % incidence rate 2009 represent dramatic rise 0.9 % 4 year earlier . Single center data report suggest much low rate BK viremia nephropathy cohort treat mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) base immunosuppressive regimen compare overall national incidence rate . Recent data demonstrate calcineurin inhibitor concentration routinely use clinical practice interfere BK virus specific T cell response ; interference see occur mTOR inhibitor . Further , recent evidence inhibition mTOR pathway direct consequential negative impact BK infect cell provide additional insight observe benefit associate mTOR inhibitor . The grow problem BK viremia among renal transplant patient compound absence effective management strategy test rigorous control set - fact highlight recent systematic review . The cornerstone management far reduction immunosuppression , largely base outcome single center study screen patient viremia follow preemptive lower immunosuppression . Conversion calcineurin inhibitor mTOR inhibitor report small case series effective measure appear superior merely lower immunosuppression ; however , approach test robust clinical study design . Currently , diagnosis BK nephropathy require renal biopsy , invasive procedure risk . In addition , identification patient viremia progress nephropathy subsequent graft failure i.e . prognostication appear possible renal biopsy result present . Validation potential non-invasive biomarkers provide unique opportunity detection risk stratification patient BK viremia subsequent failure , could lead inform therapeutic intervention support development new therapy .</detailed_description>
