	<criteria>Key Histologically confirm diagnosis epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer ( measurable evaluable , nonmeasurable disease ) platinumresistant refractory . In judgment Investigator , patient platinumsensitive would benefit platinum treatment also eligible . Must ≥ 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen contain carboplatin , cisplatin another organoplatinum compound management primary disease . This initial treatment may include intraperitoneal ( IP ) therapy , consolidation , noncytotoxic agent extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 , 1 2 . Available archival tumor sample ( excisional core biopsy ) acquire provide consent biomarker test tumor . Additional criterion exist . Key History concurrent evidence retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) current risk factor RVO . Prior therapy MEK inhibitor . History hypersensitivity taxanes drug formulation contain Cremophor® . History acute coronary syndrome .
