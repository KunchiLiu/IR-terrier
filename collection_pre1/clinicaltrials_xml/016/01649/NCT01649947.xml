	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine combination one standard treatment lung cancer plus additional drug , hydroxychloroquine . The standard treatment lung cancer use include 2 chemotherapy drug , call paclitaxel carboplatin . Some patient specific type lung cancer also receive another drug , drug target blood vessel , call bevacizumab ( also know avastin ) . Hydroxychloroquine FDA approve drug treatment malaria , rheumatoid arthritis lupus erythematosis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed protocolspecific inform consent . 18 year age old . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Cancer criterion : Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer . Mixed tumor categorize predominant cell type unless small cell element present , case patient ineligible . Cytologic histologic element establish metastatic tumor aspirate biopsy . Sputum cytology alone sufficient . Advanced stage NSCLC ( stage IVa ( ( malignant pleural effusion ( stag stage IVa recent stag system ) , stage IV , recurrent disease ) ) . Measurable disease accord RECIST criterion . Patient CNS metastasis require stable disease document treatment ( surgery , Whole Brain radiation therapy ) least 2 week , four ( 4 ) week prefer . No delay onset therapy require patient undergo stereotactic RT brain lesion ( ) . A contrast enhance brain CT brain MRI require within 35 day enrollment . Patients brain metastasis qualify protocol therapy include Cohort 2 ( ineligible treatment Bevacizumab ) . Prior radiation site brain allow , complete least 2 week treatment provide radiationrelated toxicity resolve ≤ Grade 1 . Stereotactic irradiation site excludes need wait period . Laboratory requirement Adequate organ function , evidence ALL following : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm³ platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ; patient Gilbert 's disease , patient must isolate hyperbilirubinemia ( e.g . liver function test abnormality ) , maximum bilirubin ≤ 2 X institutional ULN . AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN absence liver metastases ; AST ALT ≤ 5 x ULN presence liver metastases alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min estimate use CockcroftGault formula . Comorbidities For Cohort 1 : ( Bevacizumab eligible ) For patient major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior enrollment , anticipate need active treatment , may participate receive Bevacizumab start second third cycle would standard care . Placement vascular access device consider major surgery , incision must heal initiation treatment . Patients must systolic blood pressure ≤ 150 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg ( use antihypertensive medication achieve goal allow ) . Adequate organ function INR ≤ 1.5 aPTT WNL . Urine Protein Creatinine ( UPC ) ratio &lt; 1.0 24 hour urine protein ratio &lt; 1000 mg UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24 urine protein excretion . A UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1 gm . To obtain UPC ratio : Obtain least 4 mL random urine sample Determine protein creatinine concentration Calculate UPC use one follow formula [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] value report mg/dL [ ( urine protein ) x 0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] urine creatinine report mmol/L For ALL ( Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ) : Women must : Have negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior study entry woman childbearing potential , OR Be least one year postmenopausal , OR Be surgically sterile Patients childbearing child father potential must willing use acceptable method birth control prior study entry duration study . Acceptable method contraception include hormonal , barrier method , intrauterine device , tubal ligation/vasectomy abstinence . Cancer criterion : No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy target therapy advanced metastatic setting . Postoperative adjuvant therapy previously resect NSCLC allow long last dose give great 1 year study entry , current evidence disease progression . No active malignancy NSCLC . Patients history basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , ductal lobular carcinoma situ breast within past 3 year must treat curative intent . Patients history prior malignancy eligible provide treated curative intent free disease &gt; 3 year . Comorbidities For Cohort 1 : ( Bevacizumab eligible ) No history gross hemoptysis ( define bright red blood halfteaspoon ) within 3 month prior enrollment . None follow condition within 6 month prior enrollment : myocardial infarction , stroke symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . No history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior enrollment . No serious nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture . Patients must unstable angina NYHA classification congestive heart failure Grade ≥ 2 . No history significant vascular disease ( eg aortic aneurysm ) . No current recent ( within 28 day enrollment ) full dose anticoagulant thrombolytic agent . For Cohort 2 ( Bevacizumab ineligible ) : None follow condition within 6 month prior enrollment : myocardial infarction , stroke symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Patients must unstable angina NYHA classification congestive heart failure Grade ≥ 2 . No history significant vascular disease ( eg aortic aneurysm ) . For ALL ( Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ) : Patients must psoriasis porphyria . No known hypersensitivity 4aminoquinoline compound . Patients must know suspected G6P deficiency . No know bleed diathesis coagulopathy . No known GI pathology would interfere drug bioavailability . No peripheral sensory neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 study entry . No known prior hypersensitivity carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab hydroxychloroquine component . No ongoing active infection study entry . Patients must receive treatment rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus . Patients must HIV take HAART therapy . Patients must history condition ( social medical ) , opinion Investigator , might interfere patient 's compliance protocol pose additional unacceptable risk patient . Women must NOT pregnant breastfeeding . Must take hydroxychloroquine treatment prophylaxis malaria .</criteria>
