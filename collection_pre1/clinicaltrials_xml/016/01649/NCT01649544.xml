	<brief_summary>In pre-operative cardiac surgery , 30 40 % patient mitral valvulopathy episode paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) permanent chronic atrial fibrillation ( CAF ) . According 1999 PMSI data , close 4000 mitral valve intervention perform France , word , 1000 patient present condition annually ; despite surgical correction valvulopathy , patient present pre-operative chronic atrial fibrillation remain fibrillation follow surgery despite treatment anti-arrhythmic agent associate cardioversion . Thus , survival rate without AF recurrence 10 % 1 year 5 % 2 year patient AF prior surgery ; hand , patient sinus rhythm time surgery without antecedent AF exhibit incidence AF 90 % 74 % 1 2 year , respectively . It also show numerous study long-term morbidity patient atrial valve surgery high AF . For 10 year , radio-frequency technique use endocavitary approach show great efficacy maintain sinus rhythm drug therapy even though technique invasive . These radio-frequency technique develop tested mitral surgery , , investigator knowledge , one randomize study carry population permanent AF use radio-frequency technique via endocardial approach . Maintenance sinus rhythm obtain 44.4 % patient versus 4.5 % control group ; result accordance publish prospective retrospective registry use technique peri-operatively . The principal problem study absence medical treatment control group . In addition , use radio-frequency technique require atriotomy result prolonged surgical time , increase peri-operative morbidity . Other simple ablation technique develop , one use ultrasound . In comparison radio-frequency method , latter technique present numerous advantage include absence atriotomy due fact epicardial pathway use , short procedure time ( 11 min average ) , excellent reproducibility , transmural character lesion , along simplicity application . There , investigator knowledge , randomize study compare peri-operative ultrasound technique ( EPICOR ) mitral valve surgery conservative reference treatment , notably mitral valve surgery couple long-term amiodarone treatment . In effect , amiodarone efficacious anti-arrhythmic agent long-term , drug associate high percentage significant side effect , close 20 % 2 year . The available result use ultrasound technique registry pertain follow-up patient undergoing cardiac mitral aortic surgery , antecedent AF . The result appear encouraging 85 % case maintain sinus rhythm 12 month recent study . In clinical context , French multi-centric registry evaluate peri-operative treatment AF propose technique ( cryotherapy , radio-frequency , ultrasound ) . The percentage maintenance sinus rhythm appear low historical registry , level 60 % , technique use registry multiple even 50 % patient treat ultrasound ; addition , randomization follow-up 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As consequence , difficult precise idea , literature , medium- long-term efficacy technique . Despite diffusion utilization technique clinical practice , efficacy ultrasound technique compare , standardized manner , amiodarone , anti-arrhythmic agent show good efficacy maintain post-operative sinus rhythm follow cardiac surgery . We propose undertake open , prospective , randomize , multicenter study evaluate efficacy treatment ultrasound ( EPICOR ) maintenance sinus rhythm follow mitral surgery two parallel group , one group ablation via ultrasound `` EPICOR '' control group treat `` amiodarone '' , include long-term follow-up 18 month . The strategy study necessitates use amiodarone two group first 2 month follow cardioversion case persistent AF 2 month follow surgery group , cessation amiodarone therapy ultrasound group maintenance therapy control group . The parallel treatment amiodarone two group follow surgical intervention necessary order avoid confound factor analysis . In effect , AF postoperative period frequent may consider secondary number factor , surgery , inflammation , temperature , metabolic disturbance , pericardial effusion , etc . This approach justify , benefit associate peri-operative ultrasound technique validate , would allow reduction use anti-arrhythmic agent , associate side effect , along decrease long-term morbidity via result maintenance sinus rhythm . In addition , technique ablation via ultrasound could , among others , replace surgical technique reference ( Cox surgery ) principal inconvenience prolongation time surgery , result elevate peri-operative morbidity . Therefore , principal objective study compare , 18 month , efficacy surgical treatment ultrasound ( EPICOR ) maintenance sinus rhythm follow mitral valve surgery comparison amiodarone .</detailed_description>
