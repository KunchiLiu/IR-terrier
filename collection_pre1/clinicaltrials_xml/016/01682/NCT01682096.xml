	<brief_summary>The Diagnosis acute coronary syndrome patient present acute chest pain problematic , electrocardiogram serum troponins normal . Multidetector row compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) allow direct rapid non-invasive visualization coronary artery disease . The investigator 's aim ass diagnostic accuracy safety novel diagnostic strategy base MDCT compare strategy use stress echocardiography workup patient chest pain , normal electrocardiogram , normal troponins suspect coronary artery disease . Additionally , cost associate strategy compare . Methods . A total 150 patient acute chest pain come emergency room intermediate probability significant coronary artery disease , normal ECG troponins prospectively randomize MDCT stress echocardiography exercise . Patients show coronary stenosis &gt; 50 % MDCT abnormal stress echocardiography inconclusive result admit study . The primary endpoint study detection acute coronary syndrome , define typical atypical angina document significant coronary artery disease ( &gt; 50 % stenosis ) invasive coronariography , positive stress test occurrence cardiac death , myocardial infarction need revascularization 6 month follow-up . All MDCT angiogram echocardiograms evaluate experienced radiologist cardiologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Safety Study Coronary CTA Diagnosis Acute Coronary Syndrome Emergency Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design Aim : This prospective pilot study evaluate role multidetector row compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) rule Acute Coronary Syndrome among patient present ER chest pain complaint , non-diagnostic ECG normal troponins intermediate pre-test probability significant CAD . Methods : Following initial clinical evaluation result initial ECG , blood test X-ray , patient meet inclusion criterion randomize undergo either CTA scan Exercise Stress Echocardiogram rule significant coronary artery disease . CTA carry 64 128 slice-CT Scanner ( SIEMENS , Somaton Sensation 64 128-Flash Definition ) follow iv administration iodinate contrast ( bolus : 5cc x acquisition time ( seg ) + 10 cc ) . Images interpret two experienced physician ( radiologist cardiologist ) Stress Echocardiography perform interpret experienced Echocardiographer ( cardiologist ) . Clinical decision making : Patients positive inconclusive test arm admit hospital treatment additional testing , patient negative result discharge ER . Safety issue : A phone call chart review perform one month 6 month follow-up register occurrence major adverse cardiac event , well new consultation chest pain .</detailed_description>
