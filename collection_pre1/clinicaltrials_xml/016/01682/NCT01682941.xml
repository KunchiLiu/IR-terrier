	<brief_title>Soy Isoflavones Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer Rising Prostate-Specific Antigen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To precisely quantify absorption , serum concentration time , excretion pattern soy isoflavones metabolite men consume two bread product define relationship dietary intake , isoflavone metabolism biological outcome . II . To describe safety well incidence severity toxicity men consume control soy bread beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread . III . To see consumption beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compare control soy bread great effect blood hormonal pattern biomarkers favor anti-prostate cancer activity . IV . To see beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compare control soy bread improve hormonal pattern ( low insulin like growth factor-I , increased insulin like growth factor bind protein 3 , low androgen ) , reduce prostate specific antigen velocity , low circulate vascular endothelial growth factor concentration . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( close accrual 02/14/2011 ) . ARM I : Patients consume 2 slice soy bread daily 8 week . ARM II : Patients consume 2 slice soy almond bread daily 8 week . After 2 week washout period , patient crossover alternate treatment arm .</detailed_description>
