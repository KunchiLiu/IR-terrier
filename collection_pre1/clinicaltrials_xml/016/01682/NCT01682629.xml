	<brief_summary>The investigative team 's purpose conduct research improve effective efficient translation implementation evidence base advanced life support practice provider care child . This specific project aim accomplish 2 major goal . The investigator aim evaluate utility debrief script specifically design facilitate debriefing use novice Pediatric Advanced Life Support instructor low high realism simulation-based learning . Secondly , investigator hope evaluate effectiveness high realism simulation vs. low realism simulation achieve PALS-based educational outcome , knowledge skill acquisition . The investigator hypothesize SCRIPTED debrief novice instructor follow low high fidelity simulation-based learning : 1 . Improve cognitive performance knowledge multidisciplinary team member assess cognitive performance tool multiple choice test compare traditional , NON-SCRIPTED debriefing ; 2 . Improve behavioural , teamwork communication skill multidisciplinary team member assess validated assessment tool compare traditional , NON-SCRIPTED debriefing ; The investigator hypothesize HIGH REALISM simulation-based learning : 1 . Improve cognitive performance knowledge multidisciplinary team member assess cognitive performance tool multiple choice test compare traditional , LOW REALISM simulation ; 2 . Improve behavioural , teamwork communication skill multidisciplinary team member assess validated assessment tool compare traditional , LOW REALISM simulation ;</brief_summary>
