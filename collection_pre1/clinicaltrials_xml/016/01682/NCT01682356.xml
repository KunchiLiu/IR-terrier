	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine nitrate food , case - beetroot juice ( BRJ ) - efficacious improve exercise tolerance and/or peak power patient heart failure . The investigator also determine BRJ improve blood pressure , exercise efficiency , vascular muscle function , whether blood level nitrate increase hourly total 4 hour BRJ ingestion . A secondary aim determine BRJ-derived nitrate still effective 1 , 2 4 week start treatment . A tertiary aim determine variation 6 minute walk test . Subjects answer basic medical information sheet undergo 6-minute walk test . After least 48 hour rest , subject ask repeat 6 minute ' walk . The investigator ( 1 ) determine BRJ ( compare placebo ) improve peak power output heart failure patient control ( ~ 1½ 2 hour ingestion ) ; ( 2 ) compare change cardiac muscle ( average ~ 8-12 hour ) BRJ placebo ingestion patient undergoing left ventricle ( LV ) assist device placement clinical purpose . ( cross-sectional study ) ; ( 3 ) determine BRJ decrease elevate pulmonary artery ( PA ) pressure improve vascular and/or microvascular function ( ~ 1½ - 2 hour ingestion ) patient already come PA catheter placement clinical purpose ; ( 4 ) compare physiological change BRJ ingestion non-heart failure control subject patient heart failure . Endpoints measure time point ingestion . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) patient heart failure control improved exercise capacity power lower oxygen cost ( thereby great efficiency ) ~ 1½- 2 hour ingest beet juice ( BRJ ) ingest placebo ( beet juice without nitrate ) ; ( 2 ) patient heart failure great physiologic response BRJ non-heart failure control since former bad physiological function start ; ( 3 ) patient high pulmonary artery pressure improvement pressure ingestion BRJ ; ( 4 ) myocardial perfusion high BRJ ingestion placebo ; ( 5 ) cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) level increase leave ventricle assist device ( LVAD ) sample BRJ ingestion compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For study sub-studies : A ) All Subjects consent . B ) All Subjects give permission investigator review medical record . For BRJ main study ( acute dose BRJ intervention ) : 1 . After consent participate , subject instruct refrain spitting use antibacterial mouthwash , antacid , proton pump inhibitor , chew gum study . 2 . Subjects ask answer questionnaire regard medical health ( basic health questionnaire , Minnesota live heart failure questionnaire , magnetic resonance safety -i.e. , question regard implanted pacemaker , etc ... ) 2a ) Subjects undergo physical examination one time study . 3 . Subjects interview dietician regard typical dietary intake instruct low nitrate diet . 4 . In study visit # 1 subject randomize receive either `` shot '' BRJ ( James White Drinks ) placebo ( BRJ without nitrate ) . 5 . Before 3 time point ( ~hourly ) receive BRJ placebo , subject undergo phlebotomy plasma nutrient/hormone level blood pressure check . They also ask swish ( 5 minute ) spit dilute ~ 4tbps solution nitrate , quantify nitrate nitrite conversion ~ 1 1/4 hour ingestion 5A ) Subjects undergo echocardiogram swish spit . 6 . ~ 1 3/4 hour ingestion , subject undergo 6 minute walk . 7 . ~ 2 hour ingestion , subject pedal ergometer 6 min 15 , 30 , 45 W ( require ~50 , ~60 , ~70 % oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) peak , i.e. , peak oxygen consumption ) VO2 measure use ParvoMedics TrueOne ( brand ) metabolic cart . Five min rest allow stage . The average VO2 last 2 min stage use calculate gross delta efficiency use stoichiometric equation previously describe . Following 10 min rest period , peak power VO2 peak determine continuous exercise test perform use 10 W/min ramp protocol . 8 . Subjects ( immediately afterwards ) undergo Magnetic resonance ( MR ) study skeletal muscle ( time cardiac performance ) mild exercise ( push one foot pedal 6 min submaximal isometric exercise ( 1 contraction 50 % previously-determined maximal voluntary contraction - accord VO2 peak level medical chart - every 9 ) spectrum acquire , , exercise . During exercise , subject heart rate , blood pressure rhythm monitor . 9 . Subjects ask undergo mouth swab bacterial DNA analysis ( swish spit ) 9A ) Subjects undergo Dual-energy Xray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan body composition analysis ( either BRJ ingestion - phenotyping measure - endpoint ) 10 . Subjects undergo 7 wash-out period 11 . Subjects come study day 2 receive whichever treatment ( BRJ placebo ) receive first repeat study list 5 ) -9 ) . ( The total time study estimate take 5 hour ) For long 2 ( 4 ) week BRJ substudy : ( subject include HF ( heart failure ) patient nonHF control , i.e. , without heart failure ) 1 . Subjects ask undergo step 1-9 , ingest 1 week BRJ ( 1 `` shot '' /day ) undergo study list 5 ) -9 ) . 2 . Subjects ask ingest 1 week BRJ ( 1 `` shot '' /day total 2 week ) undergo repeat study list 5 ) -9 ) For BRJ neuromuscular function test sub-study : 1 . Subjects ask undergo step 1-6 2 . Subjects ask undergo mouth swab bacterial DNA analysis . 3 . Subjects undergo test neuromuscular function use isokinetic dynamometer ( device measure voluntary muscle force production control speed movement ) immediately echocardiogram ~2 h BRJ ( placebo ingestion ) . 3A ) Subjects ask undergo optional skeletal muscle biopsy immediately Biodex study . 3B ) Subjects undergo dual-energy isokinetic dynamometry study body composition analysis ( time point study day ) . 4 ) Subjects undergo 7 washout period . 5 ) Subjects come Study day 2 receive whichever treatment ( BRJ placebo ) receive first repeat study list 1-3 . For Pulmonary artery ( PA ) pressure sub-study : NOTE : This study perform patient undergo PA catheter placement clinical purpose ( high PA pressure ) anyway . 1 . After consent participate , subject instruct refrain spitting use antibacterial mouthwash , antacid , proton pump inhibitor , chew gum study . 2 . Subjects ask answer questionnaire regard medical health ( basic health questionnaire , Minnesota live heart failure questionnaire , etc . ) 2a ) Subjects ask undergo physical examination . 3 . Before 3 ( hourly ) time point receive `` shot '' BRJ , subject undergo phlebotomy plasma nutrient/hormone level blood pressure check blow tube connect small machine measure amount nitric oxide breath . Subjects also cardiovascular measurement ( e.g. , cardiac output , PA pressure , etc . ) make 3 ~ hourly time point receive BRJ . These measurement make use PA catheter place clinical purpose . 4 . If subject undergo LVAD placement he/she randomize receive BRJ placebo even surgery ( anticipated average ~ 8-12 hour ) , LV core harvest immediately frozen later analysis . 5 . Subjects undergo myocardial perfusion study undergo basic study ( breath NO , plasma nitrate/nitrite determination , mention neuromuscular aim , subject also undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) study receive O-15 water quantification myocardial blood flow ~ 2 hour consumption BRJ placebo . Then undergo washout phase 7 repeat PET study treatment ( BRJ placebo ) .</detailed_description>
