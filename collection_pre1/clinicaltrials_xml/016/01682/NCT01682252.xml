	<brief_summary>This study do doctor investigator would like lessen amount blood transfusion give patient . Patients receive blood transfusion great chance develop complication surgery . There device call Cell Saver allow doctor process blood lose surgery return patient . This lessen amount transfuse blood patient receive . This device use patient undergoing surgery muscular skeletal tumors.The investigator sure whether tumor cell present blood lose course operation like . The goal study see lessen amount blood transfusion give patient may tumor cancerous cell present blood . One way test blood circulating vein also test blood lose course operation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogenic Blood transfusion associate numerous complication simple uticaria serious transmissible disease . While improved test significantly decrease incidence AIDS hepatitis C approximately 1:2,000,000 unit test ; hepatitis B approximately 1:200,000 unit test , frequent complication occur secondary immunomodulation , result make infection common . These due infect blood , develop change patient ' immune system receive allogenic red blood cell transfusion . The relative risk develop infection 1.6 1-3 red blood cell unit 3.6 patient receive 3 red cell unit . Patients receive transfusion 52 % great risk develop pneumonia 35 % great risk develop urinary tract infection . On average , hospitalization cost $ 14,000 patient serious infection . These infection prolong length hospitalization surgery may even result death.2 Other complication transfusion include Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury cause least 5300 TRALI reaction per year US alone , approximately 500 death . In fact , one donor whose blood trigger TRALI death find review record cause 14 previous case TRALI . Other serious complication include Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome , transfusion reaction . As group , complication transfusion result increase morbidity mortality . Therefore , best interest patient decrease amount allogenic blood transfuse ( individual ) . To prevent , surgeon employ use Cell Saver ( CS ) surgery collect patient 's blood operative field wash . This blood re-infused patient 's intravenous , minimize need transfusion blood blood bank . Despite benefit cell saver , use patient malignancy due concern tumor cell may spread systemically via blood . Due nature musculoskeletal tumor resection often significant blood loss . Dissection regularly muscle rather around muscular interval , result significant bleeding . The goal study determine presence absence tumor cell blood suction surgical field . Pending outcome , consideration make go forward second study determine cell saver could use patient malignancy undergo surgery . It unclear whether tumor cell present blood suction extremity malignancy resection . It also unknown process blood suction would remove tumor cell blood transfuse . If tumor cell find blood processing transfusion blood would likely safe . This could result decreased blood transfusion patient population . This would decrease risk patient , would also improve blood supply , ensure blood available patient require . This work highly significant would improve safety patient population improve blood supply . Data collect include patient 's diagnosis , presence absence metastatic disease , whether previously treat chemotherapy radiation date treatment . Patients undergo surgery anesthesia usual manner . Three set specimens approximately 4mL would take ; one peripheral line prior open skin , second sample take surgical field suction canister tumor resection third surgical field suction canister shortly tumor remove . These sample take Dr. Fitzhugh 's laboratory slide stain . Patients determine surgeon and/or anesthesiologist require blood administer blood process University Hospital Blood Bank use standard transfusion protocol . No blood take patient operative field transfuse . There significant risk study . Roughly 2 ml blood require total number slide ( 2-4 ) would prepare per tube . This amount blood 12 mL less one tablespoon pose significant risk patient increase likelihood transfusion . Slides stain use Diff-Quik stain method , method similar Wright-Giemsa staining use hematology laboratory . The technique rapid ( require 3 minute per submit sample ) inexpensive . Slides review Dr. Fitzhugh .</detailed_description>
