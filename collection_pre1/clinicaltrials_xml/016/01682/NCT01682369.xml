	<brief_summary>Infants young child respond well adult flu vaccine currently available UK . Fluad , different type influenza vaccine available European continent last decade , contain adjuvant know MF59 . This vaccine use extensively adults 65 year age . It administer 4000 child previous study , show produce enhance immune response child compare traditional vaccine , safe age group . It , however , yet license use child . The reason new study gain well understanding vaccine stimulate immune system , look see part genetic code 'switched ' response immunisation , see differs response currently use flu vaccine . To Oxford Vaccine Group enrol child age 14 26 month receive either influenza vaccine MF59 adjuvant ( ATIV ) one influenza vaccine currently available UK ( Agrippal/ Begripal TIV ) . The study also help find whether possible identify pattern genetic response predict responses immunisation . Being able could potentially enable rapid development vaccine influenza diseases future . We also measure well immune system respond two vaccine look side effect . The study fund Aditec collaborative research programme aim accelerate development novel powerful immunisation technology next generation human vaccine .</brief_summary>
