	<criteria>AJCC ( 2009 ) stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma render free disease surgical resection great 90 day prior study enrollment . Patients unknown primary eligible trial . Patients history resect stage I II cutaneous melanoma subsequently first disease recurrence meeting criterion stage IIIC disease also eligible trial . Patients must clear margin wide local excision . Patients node palpable detectable radiologic image must adequate lymphadenectomy . Patients must adequately recover surgery , radiation therapy , surgical complication prior enrollment . In general , mean patient antibiotic wound infection drain remove . However , necessary , patient treat drain place discretion PI 90 day window expire . Histologic proof melanoma review confirm MSKCC . A documented BRAFV600E BRAFV600K mutation genotyping IHC [ 35 ] perform CLIA certify laboratory . Age ≥ 16 year old ECOG performance status = 0 Karnofsky Performance Status equivalent The ability swallow pill . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 K/mcL Platelets ≥ 100 K/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ≤ 3.0 X institutional ULN patient Gilbert 's Syndrome AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN creatinine clearance ( calculate measure ) &gt; 60 ml/min Women child bear potential men reproductive potential must willing practice acceptable method contraception . Patients history stage III melanoma ( primary melanoma locoregional nodal/subcutaneous disease ) treat surgical resection subsequently disease recurrence meeting criterion stage IIIC disease . Prior therapy ipilimumab , BRAF inhibitor , MEK inhibitor . Concurrent adjuvant immunotherapy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy . Current use prohibit medication dabrafenib Presence active gastrointestinal disease condition interfere significantly absorption drug . A history know glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency . Pregnant woman lactate woman . A concurrent second malignancy even require active therapy . Patients indolent Bcell malignancy eligible . Prior malignancy allow long patient know free disease least 3 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . QTc interval &gt; 500 msec unless bundle branch block also present .</criteria>
