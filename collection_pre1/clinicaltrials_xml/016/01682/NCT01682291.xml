	<detailed_description>Prehypertension . Prehypertension American classification subject normal-elevated blood pressure ( BP ) reach level consider hypertension . Because new data lifetime risk hypertension impressive increase risk cardiovascular complication associate level BP previously consider normal , JNC 7 report introduce new classification include term `` prehypertension '' BPs range 120-139 mmHg systolic and/or 80-89 mmHg diastolic . This new designation intend identify individual early intervention adoption healthy lifestyle could reduce BP , decrease rate progression BP hypertensive level age , prevent hypertension entirely . Data 1999 2000 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) estimate prevalence prehypertension among adult United States approximately 31 % . The prevalence high among men woman ( 39 23 percent , respectively ) . ] People prehypertension high risk develop hypertension target organ damage ( i.e . leave ventricular hypertrophy ) , compare people normal blood pressure . Furthermore , similar hypertension , prehypertension increase risk heart attack , stroke , congestive heart failure , renal failure . Researchers find prehypertensive person 3 time likely heart attack 1.7 time likely heart disease person normal blood pressure . Management Prehypertension . - Prehypertension disease category . Rather , identify individual high risk develop hypertension , patient clinician alert risk encourage intervene prevent delay disease develop . - Individuals prehypertensive candidate drug therapy base level BP firmly unambiguously advised practice lifestyle modification order reduce risk develop hypertension . - Moreover , individual prehypertension , also diabetes kidney disease , consider candidate appropriate drug therapy trial lifestyle modification fail reduce BP 130/80 mmHg less . Lifestyle Modifications . The goal individual prehypertension compelling indication low BP normal level lifestyle change , prevent progressive rise BP use recommended lifestyle modification . Also , adoption healthy lifestyle indispensable part management hypertension . Lifestyle modification include : - Weight loss little 10 lb ( 4.5 kg ) reduce BP and/or prevents hypertension - Adoption Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) eat plan94 diet rich fruit , vegetable , low fat dairy product - Dietary sodium reduce 100 mmol per day ( 2.4 g sodium ) . - Regular aerobic physical activity brisk walk least 30 minute per day - Alcohol intake limit Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension . The first-line approach hypertension refractory lifestyle modification remain pharmacologic therapy combination low-salt DASH diet . However , wide variety alternative therapy available use improve BP control . Dietary supplement modification , well herbal supplement , may useful right circumstance . Unfortunately , efficacy add dietary , herbal , alternative therapy well establish . While combination antihypertensive drug different class recommend approach result additive benefit , clear whether combination herbal dietary supplement also additive . Many study evaluate supplement reference small data often derive pooled analysis . In particular , study date evaluate garlic well many alternative approach significant limitation study design . Should prove efficacious safe use first-line therapy may come play Thus , remain unknown , however , whether use dietary supplement association life style intervention additive effect subject Pre-hypertension . Purpose The primary objective study compare efficacy tolerability life-style modification protocol versus protocol include life-style modification along novel combination dietary supplement management subject diagnose pre-hypertension . The novel formulation include : Allium sativum ( Dosage : 1,000 mg/day ) , Crataegus monogyna ( Dosage : 500 mg/day ) , Orthosiphon ( Dosage : 300 mg/day ) , Hibiscus sabdariffa ( Dosage : 250 mg/day )</detailed_description>
