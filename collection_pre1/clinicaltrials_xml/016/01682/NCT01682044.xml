	<brief_title>Pegfilgrastim Rituximab Treating Patients With Untreated , Relapsed , Refractory Follicular Lymphoma , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety Pegfilgrastim combination rituximab patient untreated relapsed/refractory follicular , SLL MZL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( include overall response rate durability objective response ) Pegfilgrastim combination rituximab patient untreated relapsed/refractory follicular , SLL MZL . II . To evaluate functional phenotypic characteristic host neutrophil undergoing treatment Pegfilgrastim rituximab . III . To evaluate change cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20 antigen expression density expression patient receive Pegfilgrastim rituximab . IV . To evaluate change serum level tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interferon alpha ( INFalpha ) free radical level patient undergo treatment Pegfilgrastim rituximab . OUTLINE : Patients receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) follow rituximab intravenously ( IV ) 3 day later week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 15 , 23 , 31 , 39 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , yearly 1 year .</detailed_description>
