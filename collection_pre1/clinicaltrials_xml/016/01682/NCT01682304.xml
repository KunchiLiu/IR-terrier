	<brief_summary>Preliminary data investigator 's lab identify novel pattern differential DNA methylation gene regulate cardiovascular metabolic function blood woman first trim pregnancy destine develop preeclampsia ( PE ) third trimester . Further , common pattern differential DNA methylation find common gene placental tissue time birth woman diagnosis PE , suggest epigenomic pattern predict pregnancy-induced hypertension may also underlie development chronic hypertension year . It unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation pregnancy-induced hypertension mechanism chronic hypertension develop woman remote pregnancy know hypertension remote PE responsive therapeutic treatment hypertension compare woman develop hypertension without history PE . The investigator plan objectively test central hypothesis attain objective project</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epigenomic Dysregulation Preeclampsia-Associated Chronic Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women comprise 51 % total heart disease death United States ( NC estimate economic cost expect climb $ 258 billion . Hypertension , prevalent manifestation early cardiovascular disease , silent condition contributes significant adverse health consequence . Preeclampsia ( PE ) , form pregnancy-induced hypertension diagnose second half pregnancy , establish non-modifiable risk factor future development hypertension . As PE carry familial risk future development PE female offspring , implication increase risk PE-associated future development chronic hypertension compound significance unique cardiovascular risk . This raise important health concern , though little known mechanism underlie risk PE-associated future chronic hypertension . As epigenetic pattern DNA methylation associate transfer across generation know dysregulated PE , propose test central hypothesis differential DNA methylation pattern key cardiovascular gene identify woman PE serve biomarker predictor therapeutic responsiveness remote diagnosis prognosis chronic hypertension , respectively . Therefore , purpose study identify distinct epigenetic pattern DNA methylation associate preeclampsia ( PE ) underlie future development hypertension determine implication responses moderator therapeutic intervention management chronic hypertension.Univariate analysis variance use test association DNA methylation gene chronic hypertension among woman without history preeclampsia . We use multiple linear regression examine difference treatment response high blood pressure base DNA methylation pattern candidate cardiovascular gene .</detailed_description>
