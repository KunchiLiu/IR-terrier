	<brief_title>The Value Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction Endobronchial Valves Patients With Single Lung Transplantation Overinflation Native Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema progressive pulmonary disease characterize abnormal permanent enlargement air space distal terminal bronchiole accompany destruction pulmonary parenchyma . Treatment include inhaled bronchodilator therapy , rehabilitation and/or oxygen treatment . In addition , patient severe emphysema may benefit surgical lung volume reduction and/or lung transplantation . The rationale lung volume reduction surgery reduce lung size would restore elastic recoil lung improve chest wall diaphragm mechanic . It previously show particularly patient heterogeneous emphysema seem benefit surgical lung volume reduction . Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ( BLVR ) recently introduce less invasive potential alternative surgical lung volume reduction . BLVR attempt achieve effect surgery , place bronchial prosthesis use fibreoptic bronchoscope selectively occlude airway supply affect hyperinflated region emphysematous lung , permit exhale gas escape . This attempt achieve segmental lobar volume reduction , simulate effect surgical LVR . The purpose study investigate bronchoscopic lung volume reduction valve ( Zephyr ) would reduce native lung overinflation patient underwent single lung transplantation due emphysema , improve well pulmonary function test</detailed_description>
