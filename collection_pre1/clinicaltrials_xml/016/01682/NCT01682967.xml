	<brief_summary>Headache follow accidental dural punction epidural analgesia severe sometimes disable . The incidence PDPH 10-40 % , start within 48 h dural puncture . Although spontaneous resolution headache common patient within 7 day , 20 % persistent disabling . The exact reason characteristic headache unknown , believe result leakage cerebro-spinal fluid ( CSF ) dural puncture . The great leakage CSF , severe persistent headache . This large needle ( low gauge ) know high incidence PDPH . However , type needle also seem play important role likelihood PDPH . Headache follow accidental PDPH typical increase significantly sit stand often disappear completely lie . It typically locate back head , accentuate light often decrease intake large quantity fluid . In many case , self-limiting often decrease time bed rest . Diagnosis PDPH clinical sometimes difficult . It well know liquor leakage , follow spinal anaesthesia , result partial loss unilateral bilateral hearing detect oto-acoustic hearing loss . We plan use knowledge test hypothesis measurement hear loss may diagnostic method confirmation clinical symptom sign accidental PDPH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alteration Hearing Following Accidental Dural Puncture . A Study Parturients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parturients receive epidural analgesia labour would include study would comprise : 1. patient without clinical symptom postdural puncture headache 2. patient clinical symptom postdural puncture headache In addition , control group parturients receive epidural analgesia would constitute control group . All patient would audiometry ( oto-acoustic emission - OAE , auditory steady state response - ASSR ) do follow diagnosis PDPH . Subsequently , patient would observe 24 h ass whether headache resolve spontaneously . A new audiometry would do stage . Those patient substantial evidence PDPH stage would receive epidural blood patch ( EBP ) new audiometric assessment would make 4 h 24 h ass whether audiometric deficit resolve . All patient would similar measurement hear 3 month believe patient return normal hearing . In addition audiometric analysis , patient would ask fill detailed PDPH questionnaire time period . All measurement would compare patient receive EDA without PDPH receive EDA .</detailed_description>
