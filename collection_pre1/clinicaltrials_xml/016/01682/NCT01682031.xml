	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well selenomethionine ( SLM ) work reduce mucositis patient locally advanced head neck cancer receive cisplatin radiation therapy . SLM may help prevent reduce mucositis , mouth sore , patient receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . It yet know whether SLM effective placebo reduce mucositis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenomethionine Reducing Mucositis Patients With Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer Who Are Receiving Cisplatin Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether SLM reduces incidence grade 3 4 mucositis head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) patient treat concurrent chemoradiation ( CRT ) 7 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact SLM tumor complete response rate , relapse-free survival , overall survival quality life . II . To assess whether SLM reduces incidence severity treatment-related toxicity include xerostomia , renal impairment myelosuppression . III . To assess whether SLM improve chemoradiation dose delivery . IV . To determine safety SLM dose . V. In New Zealand ( NZ ) patient , assess impact SLM plasma free cisplatin plasma selenium pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker biological activity selenium . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive placebo orally ( PO ) twice daily week 1 daily week 2-11 . Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour week 2 , 5 , 8 undergo radiotherapy 5 day week week 2-8 . ARM II : Patients receive selenomethionine PO twice daily week 1 daily week 2-11 . Patients also receive cisplatin undergo radiotherapy arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
