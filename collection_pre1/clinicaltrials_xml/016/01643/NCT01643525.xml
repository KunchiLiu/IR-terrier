	<brief_title>Study Test Sensitivity Specificity Passive Wave Pressure Device Determining Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite fact approximately 800,000 stroke diagnose United States year , many physician patient approach management stroke sense futility . However , within past 2 decade , follow advent computerize tomography ( CT ) , medical interest turn toward stroke effective intervention treat prevent receive attention . CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) typical diagnostic tool use event stroke alert . These study do emergent urgent basis , since , effective , treatment ischemic hemorrhagic stroke must deliver soon onset illness . In effort institute appropriate therapeutic regime , laboratory structural diagnostic study require do rapidly possible determine pathological etiology , size , location concern . The speed diagnosis make treatment plan establish often determines patient outcome associate complication . This especially true evaluate patient ischemic stroke narrow 3 hour window opportunity resolve clot IV .before permanent neurological impairment result , 8 additional hour use intra arterial ( IA ) t-PA interventional mechanical embolectomy procedure utilize . Current treatment modality include pharmacologic thrombolytic drug utilized disrupt dissolve clot locate distal vasculature mechanical intervention large vessel . Since many patient recognize symptom stroke seek medical attention immediately . Significant time often lose onset stroke seek medical help / treatment . Although current technology quite adequate diagnostic tool hemorrhagic stroke identify subdural hematoma , pool blood abnormality would preclude t-PA therapy , largely ineffective positively identify stroke limit therapeutic window time . Positive identification ischemia rarely possible practical CT within limited therapeutic window . As diagnostic determination associate treatment decision base unsatisfactory basis exclusion .</detailed_description>
