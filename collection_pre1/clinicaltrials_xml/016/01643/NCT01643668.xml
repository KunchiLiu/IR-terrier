	<brief_summary>This research phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean study intervention still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA yet approve study intervention type cancer . All participant study treated identical manner . The investigator study continue significant risk relapse disease reduce intensity transplantation . In study compare transplant use high-doses chemotherapy and/or radiation versus reduce intensity transplant , patient undergo reduced intensity transplant appear high rate relapse , low rate toxicity complication . This study attempt utilize clofarabine , new chemotherapy agent show quite active AML , ALL , MDS , increase anti-tumor effect condition regimen without accumulate unacceptable toxicity . The reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation procedure involve give chemotherapy relatively less intense dos suppress immune system . This followed infusion healthy blood stem cell match related donor match unrelated volunteer donor . It hop donor cell eventually attack cancer cell remain . In research study , investigator look see well new combination busulfan clofarabine work reduce intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation . By `` work '' investigator mean analyze safety , ability donor cell engraft ( take hold ) , well measure complication include toxicity , infection , graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) , relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Busulfan/Clofarabine + Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You start condition regimen , also call preparative regimen . Conditioning do kill cancer cell may remain well prepare body transplant . You receive condition drug vein . The condition regimen consist follow drug : Busulfan Clofarabine . While hospital regular physical exam ask specific question problem might . You also blood test every day look bone marrow recovering , give possible transfusional support , see liver kidneys function . You receive follow drug allogeneic stem cell transplant : Neupogen ( G-CSF ) injection , drug prevent infection , Tacrolimus prevent GVHD Methotrexate . You routine regular follow-up transplant clinic discharge hospital . The follow performed visit : Physical exam monitor health check sign GVHD , infection side effect may ; Blood draw routine blood test measure blood cell count chemistry ; Blood test see transplanted stem cell accept grow body ( engraftment ) ; Bone marrow biopsy see status underlying disease ( do around 100 day stem cell transplant ) . You ask return clinic , minimum , follow-up visit 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month stem cell transplant .</detailed_description>
