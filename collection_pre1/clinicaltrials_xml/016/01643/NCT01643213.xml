	<brief_title>Randomized Study Failed SCS Trials Comparing Outcomes Using Observational Mechanical Gateway ( OMG ) Connector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) establish therapy treatment chronic pain trunk and/or limb . Standard practice include screen trial , typically last 3 day 7 day , physician patient evaluate whether SCS therapy appropriate permanent implantation . Screening trial success ( hereafter refer trial ) often consider predictive long-term success therapy , although never definitively demonstrate . Boston Scientific Corporation ( BSC ) develop Observational Mechanical Gateway ( OMG ) connector allow patient previously underwent SCS trial use Medtronic St Jude Medical lead , operate room cable ( OR-cables ) , external trial stimulators ( ETSs ) , able connect BSC commercially approve Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) trial system evaluate BSC SCS therapy physician office set prior removal non-BSC lead .</detailed_description>
