	<detailed_description>Primary tumor spine exceedingly rare therefore literature limit case series limit size significant heterogeneity . These tumor comprise 11 % Primary Musculoskeletal Tumors 4.2 % spine tumor . Of primary spine tumor 6 % malignant , malignant tumor present great therapeutic challenge . Through multi-center retrospective cohort study perform 13 spine oncology referral , data least 2.000 patient specific primary benign malignant spine tumor collect . This provide power determine influence many previously hypothesize variable outcome . The purpose study determine clinical , imaging treatment factor influence patient survival , local recurrence rate , peri-operative/post-operative morbidity . Most surgical option carry significant morbidity consume vast resource . In contrast , emerge evidence incomplete oncologically inappropriate resection increase local recurrence rate decrease overall survival . These data use refine exist study question regard patient outcome develop new study question assess future use prospectively collect data .</detailed_description>
