	<brief_summary>In recent year numerous study show response patient anti-platelet drug clopidogrel widely variable . Furthermore , patient respond well drug ( `` resistant '' ) show increase risk develop cardiac event , include myocardial infarction mortality . It thus seem reasonable test efficacy drug ( platelet function test ) modify treatment accordingly . However , large study examine strategy routine test clopidogrel response thousand patient ( GRAVITAS study ) show clinical benefit . This study limit , however , low event rate ( 2.3 % ) , strategy employ treat patient low response ( increase clopidogrel dose ) , currently know ineffective many patient low response . To overcome limitation investigator plan examine high risk population - patient diabetes plan undergo coronary angiography - treat clopidogrel low responder switch treatment potent anti-platelet drug ticagrelor , show overcome clopidogrel low response . The investigator hypothesize patient diabetes low response clopidogrel benefit clinically switch therapy ticagrelor . The main endpoint study risk myocardial enzyme elevation follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ; marker strongly associate poor clinical outcome . The aim study , therefore , ass whether strategy monitor platelet function clopidogrel treatment patient diabetes undergoing PCI , modify treatment ticagrelor patient low response , associate reduce risk myocardial enzyme release . The investigator plan enroll patient treat diabetes , plan undergo coronary angiography . Patients acute recent myocardial infarction exclude . They test response clopidogrel VerifyNow P2Y12 assay ( either chronic clopidogrel treatment 12-24 hour receive 300 mg clopidogrel ) . Patients low response clopidogrel ( ≥ 208 PRU ) randomize either continue treatment clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) , switch treatment ticagrelor ( 90 mg twice day ) 30 day ( follow continue clopidogrel therapy ) . The primary endpoint rate troponin CK-MB ( cardiac enzyme ) measure 20-24 hour PCI . Secondary endpoint occurrence adverse clinical endpoint - myocardial infarction , need urgent revascularization mortality 30 day . The investigator aim enroll 100 patient study group ( ticagrelor vs. continue clopidogrel ) . Assuming clopidogrel low response rate 40 % among patient diabetes , 500 patient would screen identify 200 patient low response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Modifying Anti-platelet Treatment Ticagrelor Patients With Diabetes Low Response Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGOUND The concept monitoring platelet reactivity patient treat clopidogrel tailoring treatment accord result intense debate recent year . There clear consistent evidence wide variability anti-platelet response clopidogrel , patient low response ( accurately term - high treatment platelet reactivity ) increase risk adverse cardiac event - mainly stent thrombosis myocardial infarction . However , large randomize trial examine strategy rout monitor platelet reactivity response clopidogrel tailor treatment accordingly ( increase clopidogrel maintenance dose ) - GRAVITAS study - negative . Thus , although physiological perspective seem reasonable monitor effect drug wide variability ( poor prognosis associate low response ) , clinical evidence support routine monitoring lacking . When analyze negative result GRAVITAS study , two main factor discuss : low clinical adverse event rate ( 2.3 % study group ) probably reflect low risk patient population , strategy choose overcome high treatment platelet reactivity ( HTPR ) - increase maintenance clopidogrel dose 75 mg daily 150 mg daily , currently know ineffective overcome clopidogrel HTPR many patient . In light potential limitation GRAVITAS study investigator propose study base follow aspect : 1 . A potent strategy overcome clopidogrel HTPR - treatment ticagrelor , clearly show overcome low response clopidogrel . 2 . Higher risk population - patient treat diabetes ( show BARI-2D study 10-12 % rate major cardiovascular event 1 year ) . 3 . Rather composite clinical endpoint , primary endpoint rate CK-MB troponin elevation follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , consistently associate high risk cardiovascular adverse event , occur rate 35 % patient low response clopidogrel . The aim study ass whether strategy monitor platelet reactivity clopidogrel treatment patient diabetes undergoing PCI , modify treatment ticagrelor patient HTPR , associate low rate myocardial enzyme elevation follow PCI . METHODS See inclusion exclusion criterion follow section . Patients treat chronically clopidogrel 75 mg per day undergo platelet function test treatment regimen . Patients clopidogrel naïve give 300 mg load clopidogrel test 12-24 hour load dose . For patient , platelet function test perform coronary angiography . Platelet function test perform VerifyNow P2Y12 assay ( Accumetrics Inc. ) , use cutoff value ≥ 208 reaction unit define HTPR . Patients HTPR randomize 1:1 receive either ticagrelor additional clopidogrel . Ticagrelor regimen : 180 mg give 1-2 hour coronary angiography , follow 90 mg twice day 30 day case PCI perform . After 30 day patient invite special research clinic hospital treatment switch clopidogrel ( 300 mg loading , 75 mg day thereafter 11 additional month - total period 1 year ) . The 30 day ticagrelor period choose prior study show platelet hyper-reactivity low response clopidogrel prominent first day PCI , subside significantly within 30 day procedure . In addition , case stent thrombosis occur first month follow PCI . Clopidogrel regimen : 300 mg give 1-2 hour coronary angiography ( addition previous 300 mg load chronic clopidogrel therapy patient receive ) , follow 75 mg day 1 year case PCI perform . The investigator aim enroll total 200 patient HTPR undergo PCI - 100 patient group ( ticagrelor vs. continue clopidogrel ) . Patients undergo PCI withdrawn study . Choice stent PCI leave operator 's discretion , give diabetes status patient , use drug elute stent encourage . PCI perform accord standard practice operator preference ( regard access , pre- post dilatation etc. ) . Use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor discourage , unless bailout situation . Patients receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor exclude analysis . An additional VerifyNow P2Y12 test perform 200 patient initial HTPR , 20-24 hour follow PCI ; time point troponin CK-MB level also evaluate . Primary endpoint : rate elevation troponin CK-MB ( upper limit normal , 3 time upper limit normal ) measure 20-24 hour PCI . Secondary endpoint : rate major adverse cardiovascular endpoint include death , myocardial infarction urgent target vessel revascularization 30 day . Sample size calculation : assume rate CK-MB troponin elevation post-PCI 35 % among patient low response clopidogrel , 100 patient group would allow detection 50 % difference primary endpoint group ( 50 % reduction myocardial enzyme elevation rate ticagrelor ) , alpha 0.05 power 0.80 . Assuming HTPR rate 40 % use 208 VerifyNow cutoff value , 500 patient would screen order identify 200 patient HTPR ( take consideration patient would require PCI withdrawn study ) .</detailed_description>
