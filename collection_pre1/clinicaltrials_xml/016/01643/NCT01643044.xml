	<detailed_description>Infants bear African-American and/or low SES woman appear increase risk adverse effect due prenatal exposure alcohol . Computer-delivered SBIRT approach may provide consistent screen evidence-based brief intervention , low cost , without require substantial investment time energy medical staff . However , several Stage I step necessary moving Stage II clinical trial . This R34 application therefore lay groundwork fully power clinical trial computer-delivered SBIRT alcohol use pregnancy . It conduct five key preliminary study , include : ( 1 ) evaluation utility handheld mobile device anonymous self-interview format screen at-risk drinking among patient attend prenatal clinic ; ( 2 ) modification exist computer-delivered motivational intervention alcohol use pregnancy , previously set standard acceptability ( expert well representative pregnant woman ) ; ( 3 ) development evidence-based tailor messaging supplement single-session brief intervention ; ( 4 ) examine validity , cut score , biomarker Ethyl Glucoronide ( EtG ) pregnant woman ; ( 5 ) collect data acceptability , feasibility , estimate effect size modify computer-delivered intervention N = 50 Phase I randomize clinical trial . Participants trial diverse sample woman at-risk alcohol use pregnancy , majority African-American and/or low SES . These key preparatory step greatly facilitate subsequent development R01 application conduct Stage II clinical trial alcohol use pregnancy . These step also provide important preliminary data ( ) novel method risk factor screen primary care ; ( b ) potential utility EtG biomarker alcohol use pregnancy perinatal period ; ( c ) effect size estimate fully computer-delivered , combined brief interactive/tailored message intervention require single contact . If successful , line research could lead highly cost-effective , high-reach intervention alcohol use pregnancy ; reduction alcohol use could turn meaningful population impact Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders .</detailed_description>
