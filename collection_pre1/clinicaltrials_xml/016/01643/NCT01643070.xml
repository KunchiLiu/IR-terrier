	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemoradiation initial treatment choice locally advance resectable rectal cancer , 5-fluorouracil standard agent chemoradiation . Capecitabine oral fluoropyrimidine think replacement intravenous 5-fluorouracil , several trial prove preoperative chemoradiation capecitabine also effective setting . Oxaliplatin , new platinum agent , plus fluoropyrimidines ( either 5-fluorouracil capecitabine ) one standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic colorectal cancer , also prove effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient liver metastasis colorectal cancer . Approximately 25 % patient colorectal cancer liver metastases initially time diagnosis quite well establish evidence clear survival benefit hepatic metastasectomy patient . Treatment colorectal liver metastasis plan consideration systemic chemotherapy local treatment modality ( surgery radiofrequency ablation ) long term survival would expect curative liver metastasectomy . As mentioned previously , neoadjuvant oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines hepatic metastasectomy improve disease-free survival , thus think good systemic control would achieve perioperative oxaliplatin base chemotherapy . In patient locally advanced rectal cancer , preoperative chemoradiation fluoropyrimidines improve local control systemic control . Recent randomized trial preoperative chemoradiation oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines fail show well local control rate fluoropyrimidines alone . But early determine non-superiority preoperative chemoradiation oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines term systemic control ; long-term duration follow-up need determine efficacy term disease-free overall survival evident oxaliplatin base chemotherapy effective systemic control patient candidate liver metastasectomy . Thus , investigator plan randomized phase II trial preoperative chemoradiation oxaliplatin plus capecitabine , without prior induction chemotherapy patient locally advance borderlinely resectable rectal cancer resectable synchronous liver metastasis .</detailed_description>
