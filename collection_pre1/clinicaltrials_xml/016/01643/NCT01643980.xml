	<detailed_description>The preterm birth consider main problem modern obstetrics , responsible great 50 % neonatal morbimortality heavy cost . Despite significant medical advance , rate prematurity decline past 40 year even continue rise developed country . In order decrease prematurity necessary two premise : identify pregnant woman risk preterm birth , dispose useful measure aim prolong pregnancy therefore avoid preterm delivery . Since 1990 , many publish article describe sonographic measurement cervix week 16 method population screen detect woman risk . Several study provide evidence inverse relationship cervical length risk preterm delivery . For reason , effective intervention patient cervix short ( &lt; 25mm ) , make measure middle second term , investigator could reduce prematurity . Regarding possible therapeutic strategy , recent publish data demonstrate effective vaginal progesterone cervical pessary population . However , treatment never compare none two strategy indicate population . Therefore result necessary compare treatment order establish clinical recommendation . The investigator propose clinical trial compare two accepted strategy : administration progesterone ( vaginally ) placement vaginal pessary order reduce premature birth ( 34 week earlier ) rate population pregnant woman risk premature birth , identify ultrasound second trimester pregnancy .</detailed_description>
