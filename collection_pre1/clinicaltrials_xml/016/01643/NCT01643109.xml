	<brief_summary>CIMT show great promise help child adult regain lose function disable limb forcing use intensive motor train program constraining unaffected arm cast . However , relatively little known underlie mechanisms CIMT hemiplegic CP . This project use integrate translation model explore neuroimaging predictor positive clinical response CIMT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Constraint Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) - Neuroimaging Predictors Positive Response Constraint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary research objective evaluate neuroimaging predictor positive response CIMT child hemiplegic CP secondary middle cerebral artery territory stroke ( MCA ) . A focus MCA territory chosen ( 1 ) target child significant hand impairment potential benefit CIMT , ( 2 ) common neuropathological subtype , ( 3 ) allows enhance homogeneity match case comparison group . The primary research question : In child age 7 16 year hemiplegic CP secondary MCA stroke , neuroimaging predictor positive response CIMT , positive response define improvement Assisting Hands Assessment ( AHA ) one month CIMT ? Neuroimaging predictor variable include laterality index ( LI ) primary M1 S1 area fMRI , IHI evaluate rest state fMRI , dissociation M1 S1 hemiplegic hand measure fMRI , size vascular distribution MCA lesion T2 weight MRI , white matter tract abnormality Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) . We hypothesize negative LI , non-dissociated M1 S1 , low IHI , small size infarction , large size contralateral corticospinal tract predict positive response constraint . An evaluation neuroimaging predictor variable persistence positive response CIMT 6 month measure AHA also explore . A secondary objective evaluate change neuroimaging variable baseline one month post CIMT compare child case group receive CIMT comparison group match baseline QUEST score .</detailed_description>
