	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cyst represent wide spectrum lesion . Many cyst uniformly benign ( pseudocysts ) negligible malignant potential ( serous cystadenomas ) . However , others represent premalignant ( i.e . intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) mucinous cystadenomas [ MCN ] ) , malignant ( i.e . invasive IPMNs mucinous cystadenocarcinomas ) tumor . Management pancreatic cyst challenge surgery generally recommend cyst symptomatic , premalignant ( except possibly branch duct IPMNs ) demonstrate malignancy image feature and/or biopsy . However , even experienced hospital , surgical resection enucleation pancreatic cystic tumor associate significant perioperative morbidity mortality rate 20-40 % 2 % , respectively .</detailed_description>
