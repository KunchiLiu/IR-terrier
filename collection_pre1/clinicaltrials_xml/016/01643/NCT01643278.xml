	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose dasatinib give together ipilimumab treat patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor sarcomas remove surgery spread place body . Dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving dasatinib together ipilimumab may better treatment patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor sarcomas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Other Sarcomas That Can Be Removed Surgery Are Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability treatment ipilimumab combination dasatinib subject gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) advance sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( RR ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 , immune-related response criterion , Choi criterion . II . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . Progression-free survival 6 month ( PFS6months ) . IV . Overall survival ( OS ) . V. Immunological correlative study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study dasatinib . Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 7 day . Patients receive dasatinib PO QD ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) week 1 , 4 , 7 10 . Beginning week 24 , patient receive dasatinib PO QD ipilimumab IV every 12 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month .</detailed_description>
