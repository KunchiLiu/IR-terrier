	<brief_summary>Studies show transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , non-invasive form brain stimulation , reduce pain laboratory clinic . The purpose study investigate TMS relief pain affect pain circuitry brain . One primary study hypotheses opioid blockade significantly reduce pain relief produce leave prefrontal cortex TMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-invasive form brain stimulation transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) currently investigate alternative adjunctive therapy pain . Clinical interest technique continue grow rise opiate abuse inadequate pain management strategy . Despite enthusiasm , study efficacy repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) pain produce mixed result . Some promising informative research focus rTMS perioperative pain . In two different postoperative study , single session leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) rTMS gastric bypass surgery reduce morphine self-administration 40 % compare sham stimulation . These data particularly fascinate give role DLPFC top-down pain processing . Centered juncture Brodmann Areas ( BAs ) 9 46 , DLPFC remain popular therapeutic target rTMS give accessible location presume role high-order cognition emotional valence . Animal human study suggest cingulofrontal region like DLPFC may modulate pain perception via recruitment opioidergic midbrain brainstem structure like periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) rostroventromedial medulla ( RVM ) , respectively . These data outline functional circuitry might involve analgesic effect DLPFC rTMS . While many study aim evaluate clinical efficacy DLPFC rTMS pain management , examine affect pain processing . Imaging cerebral signature pain leave DLPFC rTMS might reveal information pain circuitry help elucidate mechanism prefrontal rTMS may produce analgesia . Previous study suggest opioid blockade abolishes leave right DLPFC rTMS-induced analgesia . In study , priori hypothesis leave DLPFC rTMS would attenuate blood oxygenation-level dependent ( BOLD ) signal response painful stimulus pain processing region . More specifically , anticipate midbrain medulla BOLD signal change induce left DLPFC rTMS would abolish pretreatment Î¼-opioid antagonist naloxone .</detailed_description>
