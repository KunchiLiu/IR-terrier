	<brief_summary>This study do determine dose chemotherapy drug ( irinotecan [ irinotecan hydrochloride ] ) tolerate part combination drug . There combination chemotherapy drug often use treat gastrointestinal cancer , consist 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) , leucovorin ( leucovorin calcium ) , irinotecan oxaliplatin know `` FOLFIRINOX '' . FOLFIRINOX current drug therapy combination ( regimen ) use people advanced pancreatic cancer , although combination Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve indication . FOLFIRINOX recently show separate clinical trial increase survival compare another commonly use drug pancreatic cancer call gemcitabine . FOLFIRINOX also reasonable regimen advance cancer gastrointestinal tract , include colon cancer , rectal cancer , esophagus cancer , stomach cancer , gall bladder cancer , bile duct cancer , ampullary cancer , cancer unknown primary location . The best dose irinotecan use FOLFIRINOX know . This study analyze one gene ( uridine 5'-diphospho [ UDP ] glucuronosyltransferase 1 family , polypeptide A1 [ UGT1A1 ] gene ) subject presence alteration gene , may affect body handle irinotecan . Genes help determine investigator individual characteristic , eye color , height skin tone . Genes may also determine people get certain disease medicine may affect . The result genetic analysis divide subject one three group : A , B , C. Group A ( approximately 45 % subject ) receive standard dose irinotecan . Group B ( approximately 45 % subject ) receive low dose irinotecan . Group C ( approximately 10 % subject ) receive even low dose irinotecan</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) rate cycle # 1 two UGT1A1 genotype group ( *1*1 , *1*28 ) use genotype-guided dosing irinotecan part modify ( ) FOLFIRINOX regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine cumulative dose intensity irinotecan achieve genotype group . II . To determine response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ( version 1.1 ) different disease ( pancreatic cancer , biliary cancer , gastric cancer , colorectal cancer , adenocarcinoma unknown primary ) treat study . OUTLINE : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1.5 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
