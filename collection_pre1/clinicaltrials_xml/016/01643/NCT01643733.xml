	<brief_title>Study Fistuloplasty Using Flow Measurement Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized study . All intervention carry experienced radiologist two study centre . At least fifty ( 50 ) consecutive subject meet eligibility criterion , schedule angiographic assessment ( view PTA necessary ) , invite participate study . Subjects consent undergo procedure , perform qualified interventional radiology doctor ( IRD ) . Patients randomly allocate group . All previous Transonics measurement available treat IRD . A target flow rate pre-decided patient consultation nephrology service . - All patient undergo fistulogram , routine interventional Xray exam radiocontrast medium ( RCM ) inject X ray control identify narrowing within vessel . Significant lesion identify base exam . If lesion believe significant , patient assign either arm study . The detail disease present record location percentage stenosis . - In control arm , initial Transonic measurement pre-treatment perform . The interventionalist select significant lesion base angiographic appearance treat lesion , may require use multiple balloon lesion . At point Transonics measurement take - Measurement A . The result reveal interventionalist , proceed procedure per standard practice . A Transonics measurement take treatment significant lesion identify start exam . A post-procedural Transonics measurement ( Measurement X ) also take , interventionalist blind result . The appearance completion angiography record percentage stenosis remain . - In Transonics arm , pre-treatment Transonic measurement do . The lesion treat . Once Measurement A obtain , interventionalist inform target value reach , tell actual value . This repeat treatment subsequent lesion , interventionalist inform target reach , whilst blind Transonics result , target achieve . The interventionalist pursue treatment , regardless Transonics measurement , deems would pose great risk complication patient , his/her standard practice . The appearance completion angiography record percentage stenosis remain .</detailed_description>
