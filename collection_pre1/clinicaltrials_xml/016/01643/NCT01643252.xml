For female capable become pregnant , agree urine pregnancy test perform prior randomization study eye prior treatment fellow and/or crossover eye ; must lactate , must agree use medically acceptable form birth control least one week prior randomization visit , one week prior treatment fellow eye crossover eye , continue use method one month follow last treatment . Acceptable form birth control spermicide barrier , oral contraceptive , injectable implantable method contraception , transdermal contraceptive , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization partner . For nonsexually active female , abstinence consider acceptable form birth control . Women consider capable become pregnant include female experience menarche experience menopause ( define amenorrhea great 12 consecutive month ) undergo successful surgical sterilization ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) ; 5 . Having diagnosis corneal ectasia refractive surgery ; 6 . Having axial topography consistent corneal ectasia ; 7 . Presence central inferior steepen Pentacam map ; 8 . BSCVA ( Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity ) ≥ 1 letter ≤ 80 letter ETDRS ( Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ) chart ; 9 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Removal contact lenses require 1 week period prior screen visit ( ) ; 10 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Manifest refraction must stable two visit occur least 7 day apart . A stable refraction one manifest refraction spherical equivalent average K ( Km ) Pentacam take first visit differ 0.75 D respective measurement take second exam . Exclusion Criteria Patients must meet follow criterion order enrol trial : 1 . Contraindications , sensitivity know allergy use test article ( ) component ; 2 . If female , pregnant , nurse plan pregnancy positive urine pregnancy test prior randomization treatment either eye course study ; 3 . A history previous corneal surgery insertion Intacs eye ( ) treat . 4 . A history previous Limbal Relaxing Incision ( LRI ) procedure eye ( ) treat ; 5 . Corneal pachymetry &lt; 375 micron prior epithelial debridement thin point measure Pentacam eye treat ; 6 . Eyes aphakic ; 7 . Eyes pseudophakic UV block lens implant ; 8 . Eyes maximum corneal curvature ( Kmax ) outside central 5mm zone measure Pentacam ; 9 . Previous ocular condition ( refractive error ) eye treat may predispose eye future complication . For example : 1 . History corneal disease ( e.g. , herpes simplex , herpes zoster keratitis , corneal melt , corneal dystrophy , etc . ) ; 2 . Clinically significant corneal scar crosslinking treatment zone relate corneal ectasia , investigator 's opinion , interfere crosslinking procedure ; 10 . A history delay epithelial heal eye treat ; 11 . Patients nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze treatment diagnostic test ; 12 . Patients current condition , investigator 's opinion , would interfere prolong epithelial healing ; 13 . Taking Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) supplement within 1 week crosslinking treatment . 14 . A history previous corneal crosslinking treatment eye treat ; 15 . Have use investigational drug device within 30 day study concurrently enrol another investigational drug device trial within 30 day study ; 16 . In addition , Investigator may exclude discontinue subject sound medical reason .</criteria>
