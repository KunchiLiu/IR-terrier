	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common liver disease United States . The cause NAFLD poorly define thought involve complex interaction genetic environmental factor . NAFLD often associate trait metabolic syndrome include diabetes , high cholesterol elevate blood pressure . Currently , accurate noninvasive mean evaluate NAFLD serious form include inflammation may lead severe scar liver . The goal study evaluate share genetic factor underlie NAFLD feature metabolic syndrome determine blood work radiographic study cohort twin first degree relative .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following information session primary consent document , genetic sample consent document UCSD HIPPA form review , discuss sign , follow test procedure do . For subject , study visit 3-4 hour . 1 . Subjects undergo detailed history , physical examination , anthropometrics vital sign include blood pressure pulse . Standardized questionnaire include Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tests ( AUDIT ) Skinner Lifetime Drinking History use identify alcohol use cause fatty liver disease . A trained investigator measure waist/hip ratio time measure take . The Body Mass Index ( BMI ) calculate measure subject 's weight ( Kg ) height ( ) empty bowel bladder use formula : BMI = weight ( kg ) / height ( ) 2 . 2 . Blood test : Participants undergo phlebotomy , overnight fast , complete metabolic panel ( include liver function test ) , complete blood count , protime , lipid panel , free fatty acid , serum insulin , hemoglobin A1C , fast glucose , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , prothrombin time HIV . 30ml blood collect : include 5ml serum banking , 5ml plasma banking , 5ml DNA banking , 15ml plan lab list . Plasma store adipocytokines test novel gene biomarkers NALFD later study . Fasting plasma glucose plasma insulin level obtain . Insulin resistance measure HOMA-IR , homeostasis assessment model insulin resistance , HOMA-IR ( mmol/L x µU/ml ) = fast glucose ( mmol/L ) x fast insulin ( µU/ml ) /22.5 ) . The participant require provide stool urine sample well . 3 . A urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing age . Women hysterectomy exclude pregnancy test . If pregnancy test positive , patient enrol study . 4 . The patient undergo magnetic resonance image hepatic fat fraction .</detailed_description>
