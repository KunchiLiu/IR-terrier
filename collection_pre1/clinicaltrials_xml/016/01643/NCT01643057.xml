	<brief_title>Stochastic Resonance Mattress ( Physiological Interventions ) Biomarkers Enhancing Neonatal Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apnea prematurity define cessation breathing last 20 second and/or accompany oxygen desaturation decrease heart rate ( bradycardia ) . Because apnea present within variety disease newborn , diagnosis base largely exclusion finding . The difficulty relate manifestation apnea cause lead issue regard appropriate medical management delay treatment . Our exploration physiological intervention Apnea Prematurity begin stochastic resonance . Stochastic resonance introduction noise system , alter system 's behavior . This technology examine previous medical application . The hypothesis work stochastic resonance stimulation , form gentle vibration , stabilize immature breathe pattern infant . In research study , use apnea mattress develop engineer Wyss Institute , Harvard University , provide gentle vibration infant . We closely follow research protocol UMass Medical School . Whilst infant mattress , clinical care data collect determine effect breathe pattern . We also hope collect enough baseline intervention data signal able identify candidate biomarkers apnea . This assist development predictive algorithm apnea infant .</detailed_description>
