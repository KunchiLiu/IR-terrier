	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The use program assist selection appropriate number phosphate binder meal base patient specific factor result improve serum phosphate control , reduction overall number phosphate binder use enhanced patient satisfaction . Primary Aim : To determine teach patient use 'phosphate counting ' program instal iTouch selects appropriate amount phosphate binder take meal associate well phosphate control usual care . Research Plan : There 3 phase study . Phase 1 : Recruitment 60 peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient . The information generate phase use develop iTouch program phosphate count match binder number . Phase 2 : iTouch program develop pilot test convenience sample 10 PD patient modify require . Phase 3 : Randomized control trial 92 PD patient determine use iTouch phosphate counting program reduces serum phosphate compare control . Success would base see statistically significant difference serum phosphate expect sample size calculation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project approach work plan : Phase 1 : In week prior collection standard pre-clinic blood work ( include calcium , phosphate , PTH ) , PD patient keep 3-day diary include food beverage consume addition portion size . At time standard pre-clinic bloodwork collection , patient perform adequest . Medication list review : 1 ) Proton pump inhibitors/ H2 receptor antagonists 2 ) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 3 ) phosphate binder . Doses take week prior standard pre-clinic blood work diet diary compile record . This information use 2 separate purpose : 1 ) A list food actually eat PD patient generate 2 ) The 3-day average phosphate content estimate PD patient 's food diary . A regression equation predict serum phosphate concentration take account phosphate intake , amount phosphate binder take , dose vitamin D , use proton pump inhibitors/H2 antagonist , dialysis adequacy , serum PTH concentration generate . Phase 2 : An iTouch program develop use Phase 1 information assist patient meal phosphate counting appropriate binder selection . Processes use develop similar program pilot study patient diabetes mellitus use . A convenience sample 10 PD patient use iTouch program one month document impression ease use , convenience applicability diet choice . Changes program incorporate base patient 's comment laboratory value . If substantial change require , another convenience sample 10 PD patient invited use program provide feedback . Phase 3 : 80 consent PD patient Ottawa Hospital St. Michael 's Hospital ( require ) randomize usual care manage phosphate versus use iTouch program meal phosphate count match binder use . This phase trial last 3 month . As simply record meal phosphate intake iTouch program may impact patient behavior , control group ask enter data program binder therapy information provide patient . During course study , dose vitamin D PD prescription hold constant group . Expected Outcome : Phase 1 : All 60 PD patient recruit 6-month period . Data entry statistical analysis expect take another 2-4 month . Phase 2 : Actual development iTouch program use data generate phase 1 expect take 6 month . It anticipate 10 patient recruited 2-month period one-month follow-up . Interviews patient collation data expect take another month . It unclear much time require make adjustment iTouch program anticipate &lt; 3months . Phase 3 : We anticipate recruit 80 patient great 250 patient Ottawa Hospital St Michaels Home Dialysis program complete 3 month follow-up approximately 12-18months . Data analysis manuscript preparation take another 4-5 month . Feasibility Given large number PD patient two program , novelty Phase 2 3 incentive Phase 3 , anticipate difficulty recruitment . The laboratory test standard visit occur patient 's regularly schedule PD visit .</detailed_description>
