	<brief_summary>Screening study Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ( AAA ) 65 79 year age men , show significant reduction AAA related mortality . In addition , cost-effectiveness screen AAA men Netherlands demonstrate use Markov model . Screening might even ( cost- ) effective target high risk group , patient particular cardiovascular disease know increase risk AAA . Project SCAN ( Screening CardioVascular patient Aortic aNeurysms ) project focus targeted AAA screen proactively diagnose patient high risk aneurysm eventually may rupture . This pilot project aim study value screen protocol daily practice detect AAA 's high risk patient .</brief_summary>

General information ( age , gender ) 2 . Medical history CardioVascular risk factor ( smoke history , hypertension , cardiovascular medical condition - information already record patient 's medical history chart ) 3 . AAA - Yes/ No ( Yes ≥3 cm AAA ) 4 . If ≥3 cm aneurysm , record exact size outcome time ( surveillance , treatment , treatment ) 5 . If treat , record treatment type ( EVAR Open ) outcome</detailed_description>
