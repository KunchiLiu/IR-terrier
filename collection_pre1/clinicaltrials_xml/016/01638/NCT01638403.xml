	<brief_summary>3 . RATIONALE FOR BF2.649 IN NARCOLEPSY Narcolepsy disable syndrome affect generation organization sleep wakefulness , first describe Westphal Gelineau 19th century . Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ( EDS ) cataplexy two main symptom narcolepsy . Other symptom refer auxiliary symptom hypnagogic hypnopompic hallucination , sleep paralysis , dyssomnia automatic behaviour . The prevalence narcolepsy estimate around 25 per 100 000 Causasian population . It often extremely incapacitate , interfere every aspect life , work social setting . Several breakthrough understand physiopathology narcolepsy recently show narcoleptic patient display strongly decrease CSF level orexins , group hypothalamic peptides wake-promoting activity . It also find sporadic narcolepsy dog , mouse human may also related deficiency production orexin ligands . Narcolepsy may neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder result loss hypothalamic neuron contain orexin [ Baumann CR &amp; Bassetti CL Lancet Neurol . 2005 ; Dauvilliers Y et al , Clin Neurophysiol . 2003 ] . In accordance guideline publish European task force [ Billiard M et al , Eur J Neurol . 2006 ] , management narcolepsy without cataplexy relies several class drug , namely stimulant EDS , antidepressants cataplexy hypnosedative drug disturb nocturnal sleep . The first line pharmacological treatment EDS irresistible episode sleep rely Modafinil , 100-400 mg/day , give two dos , one morning one early afternoon , need amphetamine amphetamine-like stimulant ( e.g . methylphenidate ) decrease . Sodium oxybate antidepressant main drug therapy cataplexy . BF2.649 , H3R inverse agonist promotes significantly vigilance mouse knock orexin gene , reliable model narcolepsy , whereas animal remain calm , difference treatment amphetamine-like drug induce psychomotor excitation . In addition , BF2.649 show significant inhibitory effect occurrence narcolepsy episodes dark period . These narcolepsy episode compare cataplexy episode human [ Chemelli et al. , Cell 1999 ] 11 . In agreement , Modafinil , human , show effect cataplexy , even improve wakefulness ill-defined mechanism . Thus anticataplectic drug , antidepressant , give addition Modafinil narcoleptic patient . Taken together , preclinical clinical result provide compel rationale study verify confirm , randomize double-blind placebo-controlled condition , safety efficacy escalate dose BF2.649 treatment EDS cataplexy narcolepsy . It basis preclinical study , observation first include patient , dos administer determine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Males females ethnic origin , 18 year old . 2 . Both new previously diagnose patient narcolepsy without cataplexy could include . All patient meet International Classification Sleep Disorders ( ICSD2 ) criterion . 3 . Patients free drug discontinue psychostimulant medication least 14 day start baseline period . Patients severe cataplexy permit remain anticataplectic medication stable dose except tricyclic antidepressant . The authorized anticataplectic treatment administrate least 1 month prior trial dos change throughout trial ( V1 V8 ) . 4 . Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) score ≥ 14 baseline period . 5 . Patients express willingness participate complete study , sign date informed consent prior begin protocol require procedure . 6 . Females must surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal . Females childbearing potential must use medically accepted effective method birth control ( i.e . oral contraceptive normal average dosage ≥ 0.05 mg ethinyloestradiol , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicides… ) , agree continue method duration study negative serum pregnancy test perform screen visit . Females breastfeed patient . 7 . In opinion investigator , patient must adequate support comply entire study requirement describe protocol ( e.g. , transportation trial site , self rating scale diary completion , drug compliance , schedule visit , test ) . 8 . If indicated investigator , patient must willing operate car heavy machinery duration trial long investigator deem clinically indicate . In addition , patient willing maintain study usual behaviour could affect diurnal sleepiness ( e.g . circadian rhythm , caffeine consumption , nocturnal sleep duration ) . 9 . Patient assure appropriate healthy insurance system ( applicable mandatory e.g . France ) . 1 . The use BF2.649 previous investigational drug within 30day period prior initial screen visit ( V1 ) trial . 2 . In narcoleptic patient without cataplexy , condition consider primary cause EDS : sleep relate breathe disorder define sleep Apnea Index ≥ 10 per hour Apnea/Hypopnea Index ≥ 15 per hour , periodic limb movement ( PLM ) disorder define PLM arousal index ( PLMAI ) ≥ 10 per hour , shift work , chronic sleep deprivation , circadian sleep wake rhythm disorder medical neurological cause could account narcolepsy symptom associate EDS . 3 . Patients unable unwilling temporarily discontinue noauthorized drug substance ( see Section Nonauthorized treatment ) . 4 . Current recent ( within one year ) history substance abuse dependence disorder include alcohol abuse define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSMIV ) . 5 . Any significant serious abnormality cardiovascular system e.g . recent myocardial infarction , angina , hypertension dysrhythmia ( within prior 6 month ) , Electrocardiogram Bazett 's correct QT interval ( QT x square root [ HR/60 ] ) high 450 m , history leave ventricular hypertrophy mitral valve prolapse . 6 . Patients severe depression ( BDI13 ≥ 16 ) suicidal risk ( item G BDI13 &gt; 0 ) 7 . Patients Severe hepatic Impairment ( e.g . prothrombin ratio , &lt; 50 % factor V &lt; 50 % patient receive antivitamin K ) Severe Renal Impairment ( e.g . serum creatine great 2.0 mg/dL ) , significant abnormality physical examination clinical laboratory result . 8 . Psychiatric neurological disorder , moderate severe psychosis dementia , bipolar illness , severe anxiety , clinical depression , history seizure disorder problem investigator 's opinion would preclude patient 's participation completion trial comprise reliable representation subjective symptom . 9 .
