	<detailed_description>This prospective multi-center clinical trial total 360 eye consecutive subject enrol , treat VisuMax™ Femtosecond Laser , follow 12-month period . The study conduct 8 clinical site . Enrollment phase 100 eye initially enrol follow . When 50 initial eye reach 3-month follow-up exam , interim clinical study report submit FDA along request continue enrollment 360 eye . Subjects screen eligibility , informed consent obtain meet screen criterion interested participate study . Eligible subject examine preoperatively obtain medical history establish baseline ocular condition . Baseline postoperative measurement include manifest refraction , cycloplegic refraction , distance visual acuity ( best correct uncorrected ) , slit-lamp examination , fundus examination , corneal topography , central corneal pachymetry , mesopic pupil measurement , wavefront analysis , mesopic contrast sensitivity , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .</detailed_description>
