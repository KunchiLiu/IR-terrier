	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) major public health problem due socio-economic weight . An early diagnosis AD urgently need would constitute determinant breakthrough social , financial research standpoint . Therefore , investigator need predictive marker AD , neuroimaging particularly promising tool , especially use complementary neuroimaging technique longitudinal design , allow assess relationship different biomarkers disease , dynamic chronology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The three main objective project : - To Identify , compare combine predictive marker AD , - To good understand pathophysiologic mechanism AD , - To study ability different neuroimaging technique monitor AD 's evolution . For purpose , detailed neuropsychological evaluation , biological measure brain structural &amp; functional imaging measure associate fully-comprehensive description different manifestation AD disease progression toward identify early marker . Subjects evaluate use neuropsychological test episodic memory ( encode vs. retrieval ) , executive function ( inhibition , flexibility , update process ) , self-judgment , theory mind , mental imagery verbal fluency . A FDG-PET measure rest state glucose consumption , AV45-PET measure amyloid deposition well anatomical , resting-state activation fMRI scan perform volonteer . In addition , blood cerebro-spinal fluid sample perform determine different biomarkers ( Aβ1-40 , Aβ1-42 tPA circulate blood protein Aβ40 , Aβ42 , tau phosphorylated form CSF ) . The investigator also study polymorphism Apolipoprotein E genetic risk factor AD . One hundred twenty healthy control ( 40 young , 40 middle age 40 elderly ) , 40 Mild Cognitive Impairment patient ( MCI ; i.e . isolated memory impairment increase risk develop AD ) 30 AD patient select . Participants increase risk develop AD without objective evidence also study : 50 asymptomatic subject family carry genetic mutation autosomal dominant transmission ( NORMA ) 40 Subjective Cognitive Impairment patient ( SCI ) . Clinical follow-up patient complete 36 month ( 18 month AD patient ) , neuropsychological evaluation every 6 month . Comparable neuropsychological imaging exam propose 18 month participant well 36 month elderly control , NORMA SCI &amp; MCI patient . To study compare effectiveness different vivo marker ( predict cognitive decline population risk develop AD ) , data set ( i.e . modality ) first analyze independently one another ( intra-modality analysis ) , include inter-group comparison , correlation connectivity analysis , well longitudinal assessment cognitive , biological brain change . Baseline data also analyzed function patient 's clinical evolution ass predictive value . Comparisons correlation different pattern alteration perform inter-modality analysis . More specifically , investigator address question relationship cognitive cerebral alteration structural / functional brain change different patient sample , neuroimaging data set , disease evolution . This project expect identify specific early marker MA also compare diagnostic efficiency different measure . It contribute well understand brain cognitive alteration AD . Finally , investigator able appreciate dynamic property alteration evolution disease longitudinal study .</detailed_description>
