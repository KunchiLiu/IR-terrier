	<brief_summary>- Rationale : Treatment glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) show reduce plasma glucose level extent add standard therapy type 2 diabetes mellitus . Given well-known beneficial effect GLP-1 analogue glucose metabolism stimulate insulin release , suppress elevate glucagon level , delay gastric empty reduce food intake , anticipate liraglutide develop Novo Nordisk ( Victoza® ) also beneficial effect type 2 diabetes mellitus proven several trial . Type 2 diabetes mellitus associate obesity sedentary lifestyle . Obesity occur energy intake exceed energy expenditure ( EE ) period time . It presume activity energy expenditure daily energy expenditure low people Western society . Increasing non-exercise activity thermogenesis ( NEAT ) , define energy expend due everyday activity , exclusive volitional exercise , may effective way maintain daily EE combat overweight obesity . One way promote NEAT decrease amount time spend sedentary behavior ( e.g . watch television ) . This lead u hypothesize add NEAT GLP-1 analogue type 2 diabetes additive effect glucose regulation , weight control blood pressure . On hand , hypothesize decrease HbA1c , weight blood pressure could add improve quality life less health care cost . Therefore , primary purpose study determine synergistic effect liraglutide activate lifestyle increase NEAT glucose metabolism weight . First line therapy type 2 diabetes mellitus currently consist lifestyle change metformin . When failure regime occur , sulfonylurea derivates and/or thiazolidinediones add . One third patient type 2 diabetes mellitus fail regimen 5 year monotherapy , nowadays GLP-1 analogue add prevent deterioration glycaemic control . However , comparison strategy NEAT perform synergistic effect combination GLP-1 increase NEAT investigate . Treatment GLP-1 analogue combination NEAT could theoretically overcome shortcoming current treatment strategy type 2 diabetes mellitus . Objective : - Primary objective - To determine change HbA1c baseline end treatment ( 26 week ) end follow-up ( 52 week ) 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT - To determine change weight baseline end treatment ( 26 week ) end follow-up ( 52 week ) 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT - Secondary objective - To assess change blood pressure baseline end treatment ( 26 week ) end follow-up ( 52 week ) 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT - To assess change quality life baseline end treatment ( 26 week ) end follow-up ( 52 week ) 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT - To assess change NEAT baseline end treatment ( 26 week ) end follow-up ( 52 week ) 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT - To asses health-care related cost baseline , 26 week treatment liraglutide versus liraglutide NEAT , 52 week ( end follow-up ) Study design : Randomized control intervention study - Study population : Men woman type 2 diabetes mellitus , insufficiënt glycaemic control maximum ( tolerable ) dose monotherapy metformin sulfonylurea derivate combination therapy metformin sulfonylurea derivate thiazolinedione , HbA1c 7,0 % , age 40 - 75 year old , BMI 25 kg/m2 Intervention : One group receive daily subcutaneously liraglutide 1.8mg added standard anti-diabetic care group receive daily subcutaneously liraglutide 1.8mg added standard anti-diabetic care activate lifestyle increase NEAT Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter percent change HbA1c weight . Secondary study parameter change blood pressure , quality life measure use EQ-5D SF-36 questionnaire , NEAT measure use activPAL™ accelerometer cost-effectiveness analysis .</brief_summary>
