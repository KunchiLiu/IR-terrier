	<brief_summary>Study Objectives : 1 . To prove use GnHR agonist final oocyte maturation result high percentage mature oocytes use hCG . 2 . To show advantage woman 's satisfaction propose protocol versus standard antagonist protocol In study group woman receive GnRH agonist oocyte maturation , follow ovum pick-up perform 35 hour later . Embryo transfer perform 48-72 hour ovum pick-up . Luteal support include HCG 1500 IU . Blood sample BHCG , progesterone estradiol obtain 14 day embryo transfer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Final Oocyte Maturation via Administration GnRH Agonists Followed By Luteal Support hCG The use Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) antagonists vitro fertilization ( IVF ) stimulation protocol hold many advantage long protocol GnRH agonist . One advantage include ability use GnRH agnosits final oocyte maturation , thus minimize risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome . Study Objectives : 1 . To prove use GnHR agonist final oocyte maturation result high percentage mature oocytes use hCG . 2 . To show advantage woman 's satisfaction propose protocol versus standard antagonist protocol Inclusion criterion - patient eligible vitro fertilization use antagonist protocol Exclusion criterion - patient diagnosed hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism , sensitivity drug use study A patient enrol study , result ovarian stimulation , respond way put risk develop ovarian hyperstimulation , ultimately exclude study . For purpose study , response include estradiol level higher 2500 pg/ml , fifteen follicle 12 mm diameter , case treat physician reason suspect eventual hyperstimulation reaction . Study Protocol : Informed consent obtain begin treatment day final oocyte maturation . Oocyte stimulation group achieve recombinant FSH . Dose determine accord department 's protocol response previous treatment . GnRH antagonists add lead follicle reach 13-14 mm diameter . Final oocyte maturation initiate least 2 follicle reach diameter 17 mm . In study group woman receive GnRH agonist ( decapeptyl 0.2 mg ) oocyte maturation , follow ovum pick-up perform 35 hour later . Embryo transfer perform 48-72 hour ovum pick-up . Luteal support include HCG 1500 IU . Blood sample BHCG , progesterone estradiol obtain 14 day embryo transfer . Prior get result test , woman ask fill questionnaire regard satisfaction protocol protocol amendment : add prospective control group We would like add thromboelastography test . Our aim check whether trigger ovulation GNRHa alters clot dynamic reduce risk thromboembolic event . Inclusion criterion : IVF patient : 1. treat GNRH antagonist protocol 2. low risk OHSS 3. sign inform consent Exclusion criterion : IVF patient : 1. treat GNRH agonist protocol 2. infertile due hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 3. high risk OHSS . Study protocol : Suitable patient would offer participate study sign inform consent . We ask participant take 3 blood test ( 5-8 ml blood ) : 1 . Before start hormonal treatment ovulation induction . 2 . During hormonal treatment , 48-72 hour ovum pickup . 3 . At day ovum pick , 36 hour induction final oocyte maturation use hCG Gnrh agonist . The study approve local Ethics Committee . The thromboelastography test available local hematologic laboratory . The cost single test 50 NIS . We plan recruit 50 patient . Outcome : Primary : 1 . The change coagulation profile ( thromboelastogram ) along ovulation induction treatment . 2 . The difference coagulation profile two different protocol , GNRHa Vs hCG . Secondary : The change coagulation profile relation : 1. estradiol level 2. number oocytes 3. number embryo . 4. achievement pregnancy 5. occurrence OHSS .</detailed_description>
