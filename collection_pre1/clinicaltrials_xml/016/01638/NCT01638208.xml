	<brief_summary>Aim To compare change gut microbiota IBS patient healthy control use next generation sequence method like Illumina sequence base 16S rDNA profiling . The major objective study : To characterize type bacterial specie compare diversity host 's gut microbiota 20 Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) patient 16 healthy control ( HCs ) use high put culture-independent method like Illumina sequence . To study modulation gut microbiota profile treatment probiotic ( VSL # 3 ) 8 week . To study improvement symptom modulation gut microbiota probiotic ( VSL # 3 ) 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction The role commensal flora many disease state , include irritable bowel syndrome , inflammatory bowel disease , even obesity , accept undoubtedly lead new therapeutic strategy . The recently NIH-initiated Human Microbiome Project allow well understanding role complex intestinal community human health disease . On clinical side , explore common pathogenic bacterial strain Irritable bowel syndrome patient use probiotic functional gastrointestinal disease . We take support Genotypic institute , Bangalore Illumina sequence facility . Asian Institute Gastroenterology , parent institution , 200 bed tertiary care referral hospital providing service patient GI disease , daily attendance 400 out-patients 200 in-patients . The long term goal investigator , involve basic researcher clinician , include development technological resource application biotechnology use clinical trial improve survival rate patient GI disease . The major volume outpatient case comprise patient irritable bowel syndrome . Altered GI microbiota may contribute IBS symptom study dysbiosis gut microbiota important develop therapy IBS .</detailed_description>
