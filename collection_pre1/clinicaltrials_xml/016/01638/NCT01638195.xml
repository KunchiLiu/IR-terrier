	<brief_title>A Safety Evaluation Renal Denervation Using Focused Therapeutic Ultrasound Patients With Refractory Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , single-institution trial wherein include subject receive experimental focus ultrasound renal denervation therapy . It conduct maximum twenty adult male female patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion sign informed consent form . Safety primary endpoint study . Safety assess incidence evaluation serious adverse effect associate investigational procedure 52-week evaluation bilateral treatment . Clinical utility secondary endpoint study . Clinical utility evaluate assess pre post therapy systolic diastolic blood pressure norepinephrine ( NE ) spillover . The study design subject treat careful stepwise fashion order minimize potential risk associate investigational therapy . After complete baseline testing , investigational focus ultrasound therapy unilaterally administer . Each subject first treat right side . Renal angiogram obtain treatment complete ensure result complication quickly identify . After three week treatment , subject evaluate blood test , EKG , angiogram norepinephrine spillover test . If complication preclude participation study reveal , additional treatment halt . Upon safe treatment right renal artery , leave renal artery treat . Safety functional evaluation occur three week , three six month completion last treatment . This sequential unilateral treatment scheme minimize potential risk give subject . The second key factor design study stepwise progression apply investigational therapy dose . Low dosing level establish safety profile first apply administer high dosing level . The low dose level administer first ten subject . The specified low dose level select threshold value renal denervation detectable swine model , patient participate cohort expect benefit modest level renal neurolysis measure norepinephrine spillover test . Only five first ten subject safely treat evaluated 3-week follow-up evaluation may remain ten subject ( i.e. , subject # 11 - 20 ) treat high dosing treatment . The specified high dose level select induce increase renal neurolysis thereby enable expect escalated-dose response measure .</detailed_description>
