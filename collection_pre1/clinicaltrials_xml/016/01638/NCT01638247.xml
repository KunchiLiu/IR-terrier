	<brief_title>Tamoxifen +/- GnRH Analogue v Aromatase Inhibitor + GnRH Analogue Male Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer men rare disease approximately 0.5- 1 % breast cancer case . Each year , 400 450 case diagnose Germany . Men tend present advanced disease woman , probably due lack awareness male breast cancer , patient physician . Therefore , presentation usually lump nipple inversion , 40 % patient stage III IV disease . The great majority patient invasive ductal ( 90 % ) , hormone receptor positive ( 90 % ) , HER2 negative ( 90 % ) tumor . The available information adjuvant therapies derive retrospective case retrospective study little number case . Therefore , treatment strategy base data prospective , randomised clinical study , optimal treatment unknown . As result , current clinical management generally extrapolate principle establish treatment female breast carcinoma . As majority male breast cancer patient hormone receptor positive tumor , receive tamoxifen 20 mg five year standard endocrine adjuvant therapy . A lot withdrawal treatment document male breast cancer due side-effects tamoxifen therapy . Furthermore , clinical outcome tamoxifen-treated male breast cancer patient may influence activity cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme catalyse formation anti-estrogenic metabolite endoxifen 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen . Therefore significant proportion poor moderate metaboliser propose benefit adjuvant tamoxifen therapy . Although woman benefit adjuvant treatment aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) regard disease-free-survival , overall survival treatment toxicity , case report men treat AI exist . Other data show , AI , suppression estradiol 40-50 % increase testosterone 50 % . Among men AIs , possible hypothalamic-pituitary feedback loop result increase substrate aromatisation , thus prevent complete estrogen suppression . However , optimal suppression ( 80 % ) peripheral estradiol level would necessary condition therapeutic benefit AI men breast cancer . By add gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue , negative feedback loop would interrupt complete estrogen suppression may achieve . In conclusion , great lack information treatment male patient breast cancer . Prospective multi-centre , randomise trial men breast cancer necessary order prove effect tamoxifen + GnRH analogue versus none versus AI + GnRH analogue adjuvant neoadjuvant endocrine treatment .</detailed_description>
