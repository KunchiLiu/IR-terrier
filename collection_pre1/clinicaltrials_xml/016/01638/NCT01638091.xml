	<detailed_description>A ) Study Purpose Rationale Most polyp remove colonoscopy small . The natural history polyp understood completely , risk subsequent cancer person small rectosigmoid adenoma may higher person without rectosigmoid adenoma [ 1 ] . With improvement colonoscopic image , experienced endoscopists detect polyp large fraction patient . Removal small polyp follow formal histopathological examination increase cost associated colorectal cancer screening , may increase risk complication , depend technique use polypectomy . New technology narrowband image ( NBI ) offer possibility vivo differentiation adenomatous hyperplastic polyp . Policies leave place small polyp appear hyperplastic , remove discard small polyp vivo histologic categorization without formal histopathology review could significantly decrease cost potentially risk screen surveillance colonoscopy . Multiple study demonstrate ability experienced endoscopists achieve high accuracy differentiate adenomatous hyperplastic polyp use NBI [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . The level confidence associate vivo histologic categorization particular polyp valuable adjunct measure determine subsequent clinical management . Dissemination community set policy promote vivo histologic categorization likely require practice-based learning . B ) Hypotheses The investigator hypothesize community-based endoscopists learn identify polyp histology colonoscopy aid NBI use introductory didactic program , follow practice based-learning , representative learn curve generate serve guideline wider dissemination . C ) Purpose The purpose study test educational program combining didactic program follow practice-based learning design allow community-based endoscopists become proficient vivo histologic characterization small polyp aid NBI . This study require change endoscopists ' decision regard indication method polypectomy . This study address directly whether polyp predict hyperplastic even diminutive adenoma leave place , discard submit formal histopathological review . D ) Specific Aims This study two primary two secondary aim 1 . One primary aim ass proficiency community-based endoscopists ex vivo histologic characterization polyp use NBI base photographs didactic program design familiarize vivo histologic characterization . 2 . The central primary aim ass whether currently design program effective training endoscopists classify adenomatous vs. hyperplastic polyp practice least 90 % accuracy . 3 . A secondary aim characterize endoscopists ' individual group average learn curve vivo histologic characterization use NBI practice-based learning , attention level confidence , accuracy , sensitivity , specificity positive negative predictive value . 4 . Another secondary aim determine whether surveillance recommendation would make base vivo histologic characterization use NBI comparable base formal histopathological assessment . E ) Timeline assessment : Endoscopists ' accuracy determine three pre-specified point : assessment 50 , 70 90 independent diminutive polyp ( define &lt; =5mm polyp , one per study colonoscopy , random selection case &gt; 1 diminutive polyp per study colonoscopy ) . We estimate order ass 90 independent diminutive polyp , endoscopists need participate 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
