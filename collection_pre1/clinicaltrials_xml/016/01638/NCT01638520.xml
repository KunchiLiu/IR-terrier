	<brief_summary>New approach need achieve rapid elimination dormant mycobacteria thereby shorten treatment drug-sensitive drug-resistant tuberculosis ( TB ) . Dormant mycobacteria relatively resistant antibacterial drug approach enhance immune clearance potential effective . Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) key cytokine immune response TB may impair clearance mycobacteria . We hypothesize pascolizumab , anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody , might value adjunct standard treatment . The aims trial determine whether administration pascolizumab adjunct standard combination treatment drug-sensitive TB produce change one parameter bacterial host response ( include bacterial clearance , host clinical status , immune response , bacterial host transcriptomics , lung image ) may indicate potential enhanced sterilization confirm safety block IL-4 ( previously demonstrate healthy volunteer patient asthma ) patient TB .</brief_summary>
