	<brief_summary>HIP2B stabilize form Human proIslet Peptide ( HIP ) . Human proIslet Peptide human homolog Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein ( INGAP ) peptide , show signal efficacy type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . In mouse model diabetes , repeat dose treatment HIP result new islet formation improvement blood glucose measurement . HIP2B develop treatment type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . The present clinical trial protocol propose first administration HIP2B human goal explore tolerability , safety PK HIP2B follow subcutaneous single ascending dos .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Subcutaneous Doses HIP2B Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Outcome : To assess tolerability safety subcutaneous single ascending dos HIP2B healthy male subject . Adverse event include local injection site reactions/pain assess study . Ongoing adverse event follow resolution 30 day ( whichever sooner ) . Clinical laboratory evaluation include amylase lipase review . Vital sign ECGs use evaluate subject safety . Secondary Outcome : To assess pharmacokinetics ( include Cmax , AUClast , AUC0-∞ , tmax , t1/2 , tlag ) healthy male subject subcutaneous single ascending dos HIP2B .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject healthy , male , 19 45 year inclusive . Subject 's body weight 50.0 100.0 kg inclusive body mass index ( BMI ) 18.0 31.6 kg/m2 inclusive . Subject certify healthy comprehensive clinical assessment ( detailed medical history complete physical examination ) study doctor . Subject normal vital sign 10 minute rest supine position : 95 mmHg ≤ systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mmHg 45 mmHg ≤ diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg 40 beat per minute ≤ heart rate ≤100 beat per minute Subject normal standard 12lead ECG 10 minute rest supine position ; 120 m &lt; PR &lt; 220 m , QRS &lt; 120 m , QTc ≤ 450 ms. Subject must fast . Laboratory parameter subject within normal range ( define screen threshold Investigative site ) , unless Investigator considers abnormality clinically significant healthy subject ; however serum creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , hepatic enzyme ( AST/ ALT , amylase , lipase , fractional bilirubin ( direct indirect ) exceed upper laboratory norm ) . Male subject must continue use approve contraceptive method refrain donate semen 30 day participate study . The subject give write informed consent prior study related procedure perform . The subject administrative legal supervision . The subject history presence clinically relevant cardiovascular , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , metabolic , hematological , neurological , osteomuscular , articular , psychiatric , systemic , ocular , infectious disease , sign acute illness . The subject frequent headache and/or migraine , recurrent nausea and/or vomit ( twice month ) . The subject significant blood loss blood donation , within 56 day prior IP administration . The subject exhibit symptomatic hypotension , whatever decrease blood pressure , asymptomatic postural hypotension define decrease systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg within 3 minute change supine stand position . The subject presence history drug hypersensitivity , allergic disease diagnose treated physician . The subject history presence drug alcohol abuse ( alcohol consumption &gt; 2 drink per day ) . The subject smoke 5 cigarette equivalent per day , unable stop smoking day subject confine return study relate test .

Any medication , herbal supplement natural product ( include St John 's Wort ) within 14 day Day 1 visit within 5 time elimination halflife pharmacodynamic halflife drug , whichever long ; vaccination within last 28 day . This include take analgesic 2 day Day 1 visit interfere pain assessment . Any subject , judgment Investigator , likely noncompliant study , unable cooperate language problem poor mental development . Any subject participating another clinical trial investigational therapy ( include placebo ) within 30 day screen 5 halflives study medication , whichever longer . Any subject contact case emergency . Any subject Investigator SubInvestigator , Research Assistant , Pharmacist , Study Coordinator , staff thereof , directly involve conduct protocol . Any subject history presence skin condition would interfere injection site assessment ( include tattoo ) umbilical piercings .
