	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) use bare metal stent associate restenosis approximately 10 % 50 % case . Stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction inflammatory reaction , turn delay heal endothelialization may lead restenosis atherosclerosis within stented segment . Indeed , experimental study indicate mark activation inflammatory cell site stent strut , likely play key role process neointimal proliferation restenosis . Indeed , tumor necrosis factor interleukins 1 6 powerful stimulus smooth muscle cell proliferation . The sedative antinausea drug thalidomide show anti-inflammatory antioncogenic property could benefit case PCI stenting . The primary objective study carry double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study ass effect oral thalidomide restenosis rate successful stent implantation .</detailed_description>
