	<detailed_description>Twenty-one million Americans live osteoarthritis ( OA ) , progressive joint disease cause stiffness , pain , reduce range motion , distress , decrement physical , social , role functioning . Medical treatment OA pain limit present risk , especially old population . However , cognitive behavioral pain cop skill intervention proven effective decrease OA pain , disability , distress . Unfortunately , exist program reach limited number patient require patient travel receive in-person training . There need intervention address need large proportion rapidly grow population people whose function quality life severely diminish OA . Delivering proven pain management intervention via Internet promise way address need , especially light increase use Internet old Americans . To effective , Internet-based intervention would need mimic key feature in-person intervention . The propose intervention translate proven in-person pain cop skill protocol interactive Internet-based application use multimedia expert system technology mimic in-person intervention . It provide individualize feedback , interactive problem solving , animated demonstration , incorporate learn technique Bandura 's Social Cognitive Theory , include modeling , mastery experience , social reinforcement . The project include two phase , correspond two specific aim . In Phase I investigators translate in-person intervention delivery Internet . This phase include gather feedback patient expert therapist focus group , help refine program . In Phase II investigator conduct small-scale randomized control trial enable u examine refine feature design increase motivation adherence course 8-week Internet-based intervention . The trial also enable investigator demonstrate feasibility , tolerability , safety , promise . The investigator hypothesize trial demonstrate effectiveness Internet delivery OA pain cop skill intervention . Taken together , activity prepare program test full-scale randomize control trial next stage research . The promise project enhance multi-disciplinary research team , expertise conduct cognitive behavioral intervention teach OA patient use cop skill manage pain , develop implement individualize computerized feedback report use expert system technology , development engaging , user-friendly , interactive computer-based program learn assessment . Relevance : This Internet-based OA pain cop skill intervention target significant individual public health problem expand access empirically-supported pain self-management program reach great proportion large grow population people suffer OA pain related disability .</detailed_description>
