	<brief_summary>This study test computerized cognitive training program design young individual compulsive hair pulling ( also know trichotillomania ; TTM ) . Research suggest individual TTM characterize poor cognitive ability suppress irrelevant response . This ability call response inhibition . The current study test cognitive train program design improve individual ' cognitive ability response inhibition 8-session computerized training program . The investigator hypothesize complete response inhibition train program show great reduction hair pull symptom , compare assigned waitlist group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response Inhibition Training Individuals With Trichotillomania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite ongoing research cause treatment trichotillomania , remain poorly understood , underdiagnosed inadequately treat . Further , treatment TTM child receive little attention , recently investigator begin see research pediatric trich . One possible way progress treatment development pediatric trich clarify nature inhibitory control process implicate TTM develop treatment specifically target implicate cognitive process . Examples strategy find increase availability translational research demonstrate therapeutic benefit computerize cognitive training program ( CTPs ) modify problematic cognitive process numerous psychiatric condition . The objective study examine feasibility CTP enhance response inhibition capability among individual trich , thereby reduce TTM symptom . To end , young individual age 12 18 TTM randomly assign CTP condition vs. wait-list condition . Participants CTP condition receive eight 30-min training session 4-week period assess three time point . Participants wait-list evaluated baseline post-training assessment , allow receive CTP complete post-training assessment . Wait-list control choose cross CTP condition also provide small replication sample test effect response inhibition training . There three primary implication work . First , demonstrate successful enhancement response inhibition propose CTP expect create ample opportunity clinical research TTM , also numerous psychiatric problem poor response inhibition implicate ( e.g. , Chronic Skin Picking , Tourette Syndrome , OCD , ADHD ) . This research potential produce highly cost-efficient self-administered intervention TTM . Upon establish efficacy , CTPs may easily integrate various context , example include CTPs adjunctive intervention exist behavioral and/or pharmacological treatment , instrument identify help at-risk individual preventative training , stand-alone short-term intervention , remote web-based self-help intervention individual easy access treatment resource reluctant seek treatment .</detailed_description>
