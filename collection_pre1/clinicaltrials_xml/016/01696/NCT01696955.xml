	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cetuximab without tivantinib work treat patient head neck cancer come back ( recurrent ) , spread place body ( metastatic ) , remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Tivantinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether cetuximab effective without tivantinib treat patient head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab With Without Tivantinib Treating Patients With Head Neck Cancer That Is Recurrent , Metastatic , Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( compare cetuximab/ARQ 197 [ tivantinib ] combination cetuximab single agent activity ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Continuous tumor shrinkage . II . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . Overall survival ( OS ) . IV . Objectives I , II , III , well response rate , assess compare treatment arm subgroup patient high mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( c-MET ) expression , and/or high c-MET copy number . V. Single agent activity ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) patient fail cetuximab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1 15 tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 1 15 . Patients fail cetuximab single agent may receive single agent tivantinib PO BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
