	<detailed_description>Though medical treatment effective treatment cardiometabolic disease ( include coronary atherosclerosis diabetes mellitus ) , incidence disorder continue high . Many reason responsible , lifestyle change , include increase prevalence obesity metabolic syndrome , significant cause . Recent report guideline JNC-VII National Cholesterol Education Panel/ATP-III suggest blood pressure reduction effective improve overall quality life may helpful prevention cardiovascular disease . Diagnosis treatment obese patient hypertension require health care provider address issue hypertension , glucose intolerance , body weight dyslipidemia . Strategies promote therapeutic lifestyle change ( TLC ) , specifically increased physical activity reduce dietary intake result weight loss , well define . A sedentary lifestyle poor cardiorespiratory fitness associate ( cardio ) metabolic syndrome could actually consider feature metabolic syndrome . These issue significant health certain individual , experience great difficulty treat BP control , experience increase hypertensive diabetic complication , high level obesity . In study , investigator evaluate efficacy nutritional supplement berberine , alpha-lipoic acid , picrorhiza ( CAR-191 ) consume 30 minute meal , appetite suppression , body composition weight control . Additionally , investigator evaluate effect combination nutraceuticals mechanistic effect oxidation , inflammation , vascular function high-risk population metabolic syndrome . The investigator evaluate initiation CAR-191 patient meet least 3 5 criterion ( ATP-III guideline ) cardiometabolic syndrome . The investigator determine whether CAR-191 combination compare placebo provide benefit appetite suppression , body composition certain clinical endpoint , include effect endothelial function , lipid level , glucose control . This study analyze effect 12 week administration CAR-191 versus placebo parameter population patient ( n=40 ) cardiometabolic syndrome . The study parallel design consist 2 week washout 12 week treatment either CAR-191 placebo . The total study period 14 week . Patients assign CAR-191 placebo group 3:1 ratio 30 patient receive CAR-191 10 patient receive placebo . See attached study design . Primary Objective To assess comparative effect combination ( know CAR-191 ) berberine ( 200 mg ) , alpha-lipoic acid ( 150 mg ) , picrorhiza ( 100 mg ) three time day , compare placebo three time day , parameter relate appetite suppression , weight control body composition high risk population metabolic syndrome . Secondary Co-objectives To evaluate effect CAR-191 versus placebo change : - Endothelial function use noninvasive brachial artery reactivity ( BAR ) ultrasound - Biomarkers include IL-6 , HOMA-IR , HbA1C , hsCRP , adiponectin , plasma/urine isoprostanes , PAI-1 , TNFα-II , aldosterone , glutathione redox ratio - Urinary protein excretion - Clinical chemistry include plasma glucose , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , total bilirubin , uric acid , transaminase ( SGOT/AST , SGPT/ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , C-reactive protein , lipoprotein</detailed_description>
