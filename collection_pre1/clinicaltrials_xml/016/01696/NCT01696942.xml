	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Cimzia provide superior reduction endoscopic clinical recurrence rate compare mesalamine treatment Crohn 's disease one-year follow ileocolectomy Crohn 's disease . 1 . To evaluate difference clinical recurrence rate certolizumab mesalamine 4 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month use follow ileocolectomy Crohn 's disease use Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) . 2 . To compare endoscopic recurrence rate one year follow surgery patient treat certolizumab mesalamine . 3 . To compare medication side-effects tolerance therapy , include need interrupt therapy due side-effects , incidence opportunistic infection , general assessment patient 's health well-being use short-form 36 ( SF-36 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cimzia Versus Mesalamine Crohn 's Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease autoimmune , pan-intestinal disease affect portion alimentary tract , preference small intestine , colon , anus . It well establish Crohn 's disease commonly present ileocolic distribution , follow involvement small intestine , colon , anus . Treatment Crohn 's disease principally medical , reserve surgery address complication disease adequately resolve medication alone . The single great challenge treat incurable disease deal recurrence rate . The cumulative probability disease recurrence quite high , 75 % Crohn 's patient require abdominal surgery point life . Following surgery , recurrence rate significant , vary depend manner recurrence define . With regard clinical recurrence , recrudescence disease associate symptom cause new intestinal lesion , recurrence rate 10-20 % per year.In instance , clinical recurrence appear within 3 month surgery . Taking account need additional surgery define `` surgical recurrence '' , reoperation rate Crohn 's disease range 16 % 65 % 10 year previous surgery . When recurrence view vantage point evidence new Crohn 's disease activity base radiographic study , radiographic recurrence range 41-60 % first 10 year follow surgery . One common measure recurrence become demonstrate evidence new Crohn 's disease activity base colonoscopy . This endoscopic recurrence consistently show high 50-75 % 3 month surgery , 50-90 % 12 month . It widely accept physician treat Crohn 's patient appearance endoscopic lesion prognostic significance , endoscopic evidence Crohn 's disease temporally precede radiographic , clinical surgical recurrence . The role Cimzia play prevent recurrence Crohn 's disease follow ileocolectomy Crohn 's disease remain determined , relative advantage disadvantage compare use mesalamine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients â‰¥18 year age old Crohn 's disease phenotype ( luminal disease , perforate disease , stricturing disease ) ileocolic distribution . Ileocolic Crohn 's disease severe enough require ileocolectomy ( either open laparoscopic ) . Patients young 18 year age , little data pediatric patient since Colorectal Surgery service treat patient 18 year age old . Patients undergo ileocolectomy reason besides Crohn 's disease . Patients require stoma . Patients shortbowel syndrome . Patients incarcerated , due difficulty frequent clinic visit give incarceration transportation issue . Patients receive previous antiTNF therapy infliximab adalimumab within three month surgery , patient history severe hypersensitivity reaction infliximab adalimumab Patients positive PPD suspicious find chest xray suggestive tuberculosis , patient history tuberculosis . Patients require postoperative therapy besides either mesalamine certolizumab ( steroid , antibiotic , immunomodulator therapy would permit start 4 week ileocolectomy ) . Patients significant psychiatric disorder ( i.e . schizophrenia ) significant cognitive disorder , due difficulty patient group remain compliant frequent clinic visit , due difficulty evaluate quality life measure patient . Patients history malignancy . Patients history demyelinate neurologic disease history seizure . Patients history severe congestive heart failure . Patients history hepatitis B C virus . Patients pregnant become pregnant . Involvement clinical study use study medication . The subject condition , , opinion investigator , would compromise study wellbeing subject prevent subject meeting performing study requirement .</criteria>
