	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blinded , prospective study design compare two approach ( plane ultrasound beam plane ultrasound beam ) place interscalene nerve block catheter pain control open shoulder surgery . Both approach use successfully neither proven superior . Our endpoint pain score , time block placement , catheter dislodgement . We hypothesize patient out-of-plane approach would decrease pain few catheter dislodgement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Two Methods Placing Interscalene Nerve Catheter Postoperative Pain Control Patients Who Undergo Open Shoulder Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interscalene nerve block effective method analgesia surgery upper extremity . Perineural interscalene catheter offer advantage extend pain relief 48 hour shoulder surgery . This prospective , randomized trial design compare two approach ( posterior anterolateral ) interscalene continuous nerve catheter placement analgesia open shoulder surgery ( open rotator cuff repair , total shoulder arthroplasty revision , hemi-arthroplasty , proximal humerus open reduction internal fixation ) . Specifically , objective study compare measure pain score , opioid consumption , catheter dislodgement . We hypothesize anterolateral approach produce low pain score , less opioid consumption , few catheter dislodgement . All patient undergo open shoulder surgery recruit enrollment study deviate current standard care Thomas Jefferson University Hospital . All nerve block place regional anesthesiologist fellow regional anesthesia . Patient medical history obtain block place per usual protocol . Block efficacy assess physical exam immediately placement anesthesiologist another member research team . Operative detail , include medication give , record . Patient pain score medication give PACU record . Supplementary analgesic available . Pain score , medication give , sensory examination record 48 hour postoperatively . Data analyze conclusion study several interim .</detailed_description>
