	<brief_summary>This study Phase 1 clinical trail determine safety , tolerability , efficacy Tocilizumab ( Actemra ) adjunct antipsychotic medication stable outpatient schizophrenia . Tocilizumab ( structural formula C6428H9976N1720O2018S42 ) recombinant humanize anti-human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) receptor monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gamma-1 subclass . Tocilizumab formulate concentrate solution infusion , administer intravenous infusion . The investigator propose 8-week trial determine safety , tolerability , effectiveness tocilizumab , give addition antipsychotic medication , 10 stable outpatient schizophrenia . The investigator hypothesize tocilizumab associate clinically significant improvement cognition total psychotic symptom course trial . Tocilizumab administer intravenous infusion every 4 week . Following screen evaluation , participant receive two infusion tocilizumab , one baseline another week 4 study . The investigator measure change cognitive function symptom 8-week period . Complementing previous positive clinical trial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , would `` proof-of-concept '' study target specific cytokine viable treatment schizophrenia . Interleukin 6 receptor discover clone Osaka University , Japan , Tadamitsu Kishimoto 1980s . In 1997 , Chugai Pharmaceuticals begin clinical development tocilizumab treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Clinical study Castleman 's disease systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis start 2001 2002 , respectively . Hoffmann-La Roche co-developed drug due license agreement 2003 . Data present 2008 show effectiveness tocilizumab combination therapy methotrexate rheumatoid arthritis treatment . In study , effective generally well tolerate administer either monotherapy combination conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug adult patient moderate severe rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial Tocilizumab Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic , debilitate disorder life-long consequence affect individual family . Schizophrenia also associate impaired cognition thinking , persist despite currently available treatment , important determinant quality life overall function . Associations immune system abnormality schizophrenia , particular increase inflammation , one endure finding field . Four six trial find treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) associate significant improvement psychopathology ( Muller et al. , 2010a ; Muller et al. , 2010b ) . Serum cytokine level predict response two study ( Laan et al. , 2010 ; Muller et al. , 2004 ) , another study find trend improve cognition ( Muller et al. , 2005 ) adjunctive NSAID treatment . These finding provide important empirical support pathophysiological role inflammation subset patient schizophrenia . Cytokines key regulator inflammation exert effect periphery brain . IL-6 cytokine produce peripheral blood leukocyte , central nervous system microglia astrocyte . Serum IL-6 level increase patient schizophrenia , two study report significant positive correlation IL-6 total psychopathology baseline follow antipsychotic treatment ( Miller et al. , 2011 ) . Schizophrenia associate impaired cognition , persist despite current treatment , important determinant quality life overall function . In population outside schizophrenia , high serum IL-6 level associate poor cognition , cognitive decline , small hippocampal gray matter volume ( Marsland et al. , 2006 ; Marsland et al. , 2008 ) . In first-episode psychosis sample , IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid expression significant predictor small leave hippocampal volume ( Mondelli et al. , 2011 ) . Several line evidence provide theoretical background target IL-6 schizophrenia . Polymorphisms gene IL-6 ( Paul-Samojedny et al. , 2010 ) receptor ( Sun et al. , 2008 ) associate schizophrenia . In mouse , single maternal injection IL-6 pregnancy cause prepulse latent inhibition deficit adult offspring ( Smith et al. , 2007 ) . Prenatal maternal infection replicate risk factor schizophrenia ( Brown Derkits , 2010 ) . In rat prenatal immune activation model , adult offspring increase serum IL-6 level , age homology usual age onset schizophrenia , significantly decrease follow treatment haloperidol ( Romero et al. , 2007 ; Romero et al. , 2010 ) . Another animal study find ketamine-induced neuronal production IL-6 responsible activation brain NADPH-oxidase subsequent dysfunction fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons ( Behrens et al. , 2008 ) . These finding provide support potential role IL-6 pathophysiology schizophrenia . In Preliminary Study , patient schizophrenia , age 18-70 take non-clozapine antipsychotic , fast blood draw serum cytokine , assessment psychopathology , include cognition . Subjects take NSAIDs , history immune disorder , illicit drug use past month , antibiotic use past 2 week . In 39 patient , control potential confounding effect age , sex , race , smoking , BMI , socioeconomic status , serum cortisol , psychotropic medication , intelligence quotient , severity psychopathology , high serum IL-6 level predict great cognitive impairment , measure Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ( BACS ) composite score , linear regression model ( p=0.002 , Figure 1 ) . Higher IL-6 level also associate significantly low score Verbal Memory ( r=-0.40 , p &lt; 0.01 ) Motor Speed ( r=-0.42 , p &lt; 0.01 ) subtests BACS . In first year , one clinical trial plan . We conduct 8-week open-label trial determine safety , tolerability , efficacy tocilizumab adjunct antipsychotic medication 10 stable outpatient schizophrenia . Tocilizumab use treatment schizophrenia , use way experimental . The risk find people rheumatoid arthritis know , may unknown risk use schizophrenia . Clinically significant adverse drug reaction include anaphylaxis ( 0.4 % ) , infection ( 0.1-7.8 % ) , intestinal perforation , neutropenia ( 7.0 % ) , cardiac failure . Known side effect tocilizumab common include : increase hepatic enzyme ( AST , ALT ) , hypertension , headache , neutropenia , infusion-related reaction , upper respiratory tract infection , nasopharyngitis . Less common side effect include : peripheral edema , dizziness , rash , increase total cholesterol LDL , hypothyroidism , diarrhea , abdominal pain , mouth ulceration , gastric ulcer , stomatitis , weight gain , gastritis , thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , increase bilirubin , conjunctivitis , nephrolithiasis , bronchitis , cough , dyspnea , herpes simplex . Rare side effect include : cellulitis , fungal infection , diverticulitis , gastroenteritis , herpes zoster , hypertriglyceridemia , malignancy ( include breast colon ) , multiple sclerosis , otitis medium , pneumonia , sepsis , tuberculosis , urinary tract infection , varicella . Subjects schizophrenia access outpatient psychiatry clinic Georgia Health Sciences University satellite collaborative site . The study 5 visit : screening , baseline , 2 , 4 , 8 week . At Screening , subject administer evaluation sign consent , informed consent , structure clinical interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual psychosis affective disorder module . We perform medical history physical exam , fast lab ( CBC , Complete Metabolic Panel , lipid panel , urinalysis , urine drug screen ( UDS ) ) , tuberculin skin test , 12-lead electrocardiogram . At Baseline , perform Positive Negative Syndrome Scale , BACS , Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) , draw blood IL-6 high-sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) . All subject receive 4 mg/kg infusion tocilizumab , recommend start dose adult rheumatoid arthritis . We contact subject phone day 1 7 infusion ass infusion-related event . At Week 2 4 , perform interval history , physical exam , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale , BACS , CGI . Different version BACS use avoid practice effect . At Week 4 , obtain fast lab ( CBC , Complete Metabolic Panel , lipid panel , IL-6 , hsCRP , UDS ) , subject receive 4 mg/kg infusion tocilizumab , We contact subject phone day 1 7 second infusion ass infusion-related event . At Week 8 , perform interval history , physical exam , administer Positive Negative Syndrome Scale , BACS , CGI , obtain fast lab ( CBC , Complete Metabolic Panel , lipid panel , IL-6 , hsCRP , UDS ) . Patients withdrawn meet exclusion criterion time point .</detailed_description>
