	<brief_summary>In previous study , Proton Beam Radiation Therapy ( PBRT ) find show good result treat patient cancer , good control body radiation direct associate less severe long term side effect . However , limited publish data demonstrate result . The goal Pediatric Proton Consortium Registry ( PPCR ) enroll child treat proton radiation United States order describe population currently receive proton well evaluate benefit therapy . The data collect study help facilitate research proton beam radiation therapy allow collaborative research . The PPCR collect demographic clinical data many center deliver proton radiation therapy already collect routine operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once enrol study , receive treatment , evaluation follow care type cancer determine treat physician accord clinical judgment standard care clinic . All treatment receive record , include surgery chemotherapy give PBRT . Treatment outcomes , like respond treatment , side effect , progression cancer collect information become available . A study coordinator research nurse clinic perform chart review annually update status database . The study doctor request new data within past year doctor . We collect follow data Registry : At Screening : The follow data collect time diagnosis initial staging : - Patient demographic , date birth , gender , race , zip code insurance status - Date diagnosis - Histologic clinical diagnosis stag relevant diagnosis - Imaging study obtain tumor measurement - Lab evaluation include routine blood test , hormone level , relevant lab result need assess baseline follow-up visit - Referring physician contact information Treatment Data Collection : The follow data regard treatment collect : - Treatments receive radiation therapy , include surgery , chemotherapy , date number cycle , result chemotherapy available - Dates dos radiation treatment - Side effect observe - Any treatment receive time proton radiation therapy Follow-up Data Collection : The follow data collect either come annually following completion radiation therapy treatment : - Disease survival status - Hospitalization , surgery procedures - New diagnose medical condition - Any lab result , include x-rays - Medications take - Late side effect hear loss , hormonal issue , cardiac issue - Development new type cancer - Dates treatment radiation therapy - If discontinue radiation therapy - Laboratory/physician/dental psychological evaluation - Use special service school ( IEP , FM hearing system , one one tutor , special education ) We would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like contact doctor year see . Keeping touch check condition help determine long-term outcome individual treat proton beam radiation therapy . In addition research personnel MGH , others may access data collect . This include : - Other research doctor medical center participate research , applicable - Outside individual entity need access information perform function relate conduct research . For instance copy image study treatment plan store The Quality Assurance Review Center ( QARC ) . QARC program affiliate teh UMass Medical School provide diagnostic image data management service .</detailed_description>
