	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether screen flexible sigmoidoscopy ( 60-cm sigmoidoscope ) reduce mortality colorectal cancer woman men age 55-74 study entry . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess screen variable , mortality , intervention include sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value . II . To assess incidence , stage , survival cancer case . III . To investigate mortality predictive value biologic and/or prognostic characterization tumor tissue intermediate endpoint . IV . To conduct biomolecular genetic research factor associate cancer carcinogenesis promotion , well early detection factor . OUTLINE : Participants overall PLCO study stratify screen center , gender , age ( 55-59 v 60-64 vs 65-69 v 70-74 ) . Participants randomize 1 2 arm ( control v screen ) .
