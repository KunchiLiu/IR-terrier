	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multiple dose study evaluate efficacy AMG 181 compare placebo measure proportion subject remission ( CDAI score &lt; 150 ) week 8 ( primary endpoint ) . After complete screen assessment meet eligibility criterion , subject randomize receive placebo AMG 181 various dos per protocol . A maximum approximately 80 % subject prior anti-TNF agent use allow study . At end double blind period , subject enter open-label period subject receive open-label AMG 181 single dose level accord protocol . Subjects fail achieve minimal improvement , experience disease worsen initial response eligible enter open-label period early beginning week 12 . Subjects complete open-label period early terminate study enter 2 year safety follow period .</brief_summary>
