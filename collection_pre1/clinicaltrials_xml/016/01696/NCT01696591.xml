	<detailed_description>This long-term follow study earlier part phase I , safe effective dose ( safety ) NEUROSTEM®-AD determined implantation brain subject Dementia Alzheimer 's type . Subjects Dementia Alzheimer 's type , sign informed consent form meet eligibility criterion , implant single dose NEUROSTEM®-AD , hUBC-MSCs , brain . The subject hospitalize 5 10 day follow surgical implantation observe acute adverse event : Gradient echo MRI within 24 hour post-op , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , chest x-ray within Day 2 . On Day 14 , DLT assess , subject follow safety disease progression dementia ( Alzheimer 's type ) 12 week post-implantation . In part study , subject describe followed-up upto Month 24 , 3 additional subject comparable demographic disease characteristic treatment group ( refer Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria ) enrol control group , follow 3 month compare treatment group various indicator disease progression .</detailed_description>
