	<brief_summary>This research study compare efficacy aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) pneumatic compression device versus enoxaparin ( also know Lovenox ) pneumatic compression device prevent deep vein thrombosis patient pelvic low extremity malignant tumor undergo surgery . Pneumatic compression device also know sequential compression device inflatable compression sleeve place around patient 's legs reduce risk clot formation deep vein thrombosis . Pneumatic compression device make soft material wrap around low leg periodically squeeze calf . A deep vein thrombosis blood clot . Most hospitalized patient wear preventive measure . Pneumatic compression device alone sufficient prevent deep vein thrombosis formation . Therefore , medicine , aspirin enoxaparin utilize . Both drug use prevention , study patient musculoskeletal tumor determine whether one drug well another . The knowledge gain study determine whether aspirin pneumatic compression device well enoxaparin pneumatic compression device prevent deep vein thrombosis patient population may result few wound bleeding complication</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform randomize prospective study determine efficacy acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) +pneumatic compression device ( PCD ) prophylaxis compare low-molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) +PCD patient undergo orthopaedic procedure musculoskeletal neoplasm ( MSN ) pelvis low extremity . II . To prove ASA+PCD clinically equivalent good LMWH+PCD provide deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis patient population result few major bleeding complication . III . To measure rate postoperative DVT pulmonary embolism ( PE ) primary outcome . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure secondary outcome include rate readmission , reoperation , bleed complication ( include hematoma formation prolong wound drainage ) , death . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) wear PCD day 1-28 surgery . ARM II : Patients receive enoxaparin subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) wear PCD day 1-28 surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week , 6 week , 3 month .</detailed_description>
