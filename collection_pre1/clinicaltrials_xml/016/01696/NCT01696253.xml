	<brief_summary>Over past 30 year much learn molecular genetics natural history familial form hematuria . However , enhance understanding condition yet generate effective therapy Alport syndrome ( AS ) , form familial hematuria associate end-stage renal disease . Males AS inevitably develop end-stage kidney failure , 50 % likelihood dialysis kidney transplantation age 25 year . There proven treatment AS , although study animal suggest several promising potential therapy . Pharmacological biological treatment might delay prevent development kidney failure exist , need evaluate clinical trial . Researchers interested implement clinical trial AS face several challenge , foremost relative rarity disease , necessitate aggressive effort identify recruit potential subject multi-center collaborative clinical trial . The Alport Syndrome Research Collaborative ( ARC ) establish 2009 partnership Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcomes Registry ( ASTOR ) , European Alport Registry center AS research Canada , China France objective test potential treatment delay prevent terminal renal failure people AS . In feasibility study five ARC center interrogate exist AS registry databases , monitor accrual new AS case 18-month period , order quantify subject disease category interest . As part project examine utility urinary uromodulin excretion marker kidney injury potential trial endpoint AS clinical trial . Our goal ( 1 ) demonstrate participate center access sufficient number male female AS populate adequately-powered clinical trial focus two clinical target , microalbuminuria overt proteinuria , ( 2 ) test hypothesis male AS urinary uromodulin excretion decrease albuminuria proteinuria increase uromodulin offer independent insightful measure renal fibrosis response therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center Controlled Clinical Trials Alport Syndrome-A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim multi-site study two-fold . The first aim demonstrate Alport syndrome ( AS ) population available u registries clinical network include sufficient number affect subject early stage AS nephropathy reach specific recruitment target . The clinical population thus identify form basis future RO1 proposal fund clinical trial . The second aim examine urinary uromodulin excretion relationship urinary albumin excretion early AS , assess utility urinary uromodulin marker renal tubular injury AS Specific Aim # 1 : Five regional recruitment center United States , Canada , China , France Germany interrogate exist AS registry database , monitor accrual new AS case 18-month period , order quantify subject four disease category : - Normal albumin excretion ( albumin/creatinine ratio [ ACR ] &lt; 30 mg/g ) , treatment - Microalbuminuria ( ACR &gt; 30 mg/g , protein/creatinine ratio [ Prot/Cr ] &lt; 0.2 mg/mg ) , treatment - Overt proteinuria ( Prot/Cr &gt; 0 . 2 mg/mg ) , treatment - Overt proteinuria ( Prot/Cr &gt; 0.2 mg/mg ) , despite treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor Regional Centers * - United States : Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcomes Registry ( ASTOR ) , collaborative effort University Minnesota University Utah - Canada : University Toronto The Hospital Sick Children - China : Peking University First Hospital - France : Centre de Référence de Maladies Rénales Héréditaires de l'Enfant et l'Adulte ( MARHEA ) , locate Clinique Maurice Lamy Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades , Paris - Germany : European Alport Registry , locate University Göttingen Specific Aim # 2 United States ( ) : We repository 410 frozen urine sample AS male normal albumin excretion , microalbuminuria ( MA ) proteinuria , include 46 male 2 serial sample . We use stored urine sample measure uromodulin concentration . To determine whether urine uromodulin excretion decrease AS progress , compare urine uromodulin creatinine ratio ( UCR ) group . We also measure urine albumin : uromodulin ratio ( AUR ) , analyze whether increase AUR precede increase ACR . There 20 patient group . Results compare chi square analysis . Significance Although Alport syndrome ( AS ) major genetic cause end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) child young adult , clinical trial test therapy aim delay halt progression AS nephropathy performed . AS account 2 % child chronic kidney disease , child dialysis , pediatric renal transplant recipient U.S. AS arises mutation gene encode α3α4α5 type IV collagen network glomerular , cochlear ocular basement membrane . About 80 % AS family X-linked disease ( XLAS ) due mutation COL4A5 gene , encode type IV collagen α5 chain . XLAS male progress inexorably ESRD , ESRD risk 50 % age 25 , 90 % age 40 nearly 100 % age 60 . Age ESRD strongly correlate genotype . ESRD risk age 30 90 % deletion nonsense mutation , 70 % splice mutation 50 % missense mutation . XLAS female exhibit low significant risk ESRD : 12 % age 45 , 30 % age 60 40 % age 80 . While renal transplantation AS excellent outcome , therapy capable delay ESRD would enhance life affected patient family likely reduce cost care . Several therapy improve outcome animal model AS , include angiotensin convert enzyme inhibition ( ACEi , AT1-receptor blockage ( ARB ) , inhibition TGF-β1 , matrix metalloproteinases , vasopeptidase A ( 11 ) , HMG-CoA reductase ; chemokine receptor 1 blockade , BMP-7 , stem cell irradiation . In ARAS mouse , initiation ACEi therapy onset proteinuria suppress proteinuria azotemia double length survival ; small still significant improvement outcome occur ACEi start onset proteinuria . ACEi therapy begin onset proteinuria lengthen survival canine XLAS . Despite complete lack control trial demonstrate ACEi/ARB alter course human AS nephropathy , many AS patient receive empiric treatment ACEi/ARB . In response survey conduct via Pediatric Nephrology listserv 2007 , 97 % 107 pediatric nephrologists report empirically treat child AS order preserve renal function . 70 % initiate treatment , almost always ACEi ARB , patient develop overt proteinuria . Thus , pediatric nephrologists treat child AS agent show alter natural history disease human . However , initiation treatment typically delay proteinuria develop , past point maximum benefit observe animal model . The survey result suggest placebo-controlled trial intervention ACEi AS child normal albumin excretion microalbuminuria would conflict standard pediatric nephrology practice . Transient reduction proteinuria ACEi therapy show one small , uncontrolled study AS patient , French Chinese AS population describe Preliminary Studies . Another small , uncontrolled study suggest ACEi combine aldosterone antagonism great suppressive effect proteinuria AS patient ACEi alone . The European Alport Registry conduct ongoing analysis AS male treat ACEi compare untreated historic control ; preliminary data study suggest beneficial effect time ESRD . The challenge AS today test treatment show promise animal study , compare term efficacy , adverse effect cost . Because ACEi therapy effective animal study , relatively safe inexpensive , already use empirically , control trial need test efficacy ACEi optimal timing therapy . Trials AS therapy face several obstacle . AS relatively rare disease , enrollment sufficient number subject valid clinical trial require aggressive effort identify recruit potential participant , include multi-site , international collaboration . Because AS nephropathy progress ESRD decade , trial base endpoint rate decline GFR age onset ESRD difficult fund sustain . Parents child AS appear relatively little enthusiasm clinical trial involve serial kidney biopsy . Studies biomarkers disease progression could serve clinical trial endpoint need . Clinical trial AS design confound effect genotype outcomes minimize . Description University Minnesota Central Office Role Responsibilities The University Minnesota PI Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcomes Registry ( ASTOR ) central office staff design implement monitor protocol include data safety monitoring , data share information dissemination activity . The central office house manage data generate multi-site study . ASTOR establish Oracle base data management system ownership software need expand translate exist system allow accurate transfer clinical data participate site storage , retrieval , statistical analysis . ASTOR exist public website enhance provide language specific ( Chinese , French , German Spanish ) study information relate multi-site study objective , organizational structure trial protocol procedure . ASTOR create manage relevant electronic data collection form database storage system . ASTOR staff 's responsibility include database development , management , quality control secure transmittal de-identified subject data . ASTOR create generic telephone script data obtain telephone conversation record transcript form , enter database managing system . The script translate appropriately .</detailed_description>
