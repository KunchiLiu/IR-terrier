	<brief_summary>This study examine innovative strategy monitor asthma symptom use exist technology develop non-invasive device monitoring asthma symptoms adolescent . Using iPod platform , current sound data analysis technique , prototype device develop directly monitor chosen parameter asthma symptom , include wheezing , cough activity level . This small non-invasive device continuously carry place close proximity adolescent daily basis . It hypothesize device would acceptable adolescent would lend accuracy objectivity symptom assessment ; something exist monitoring strategy yet achieve . It also stimulate adolescent ' partnership asthma self-monitoring ultimately lead effective asthma management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior research generate compelling evidence program promote self-management reduce morbidity improve asthma outcomes child . Successful asthma management strategy require patient ' active commitment engage care process establish self-monitoring routine . Adequate self-monitoring asthma symptom consider cornerstone appropriate asthma management lead few case asthma exacerbation acute care visit well well functional outcome higher quality life child adolescent . Symptom monitoring informs patient decision initiate necessary self-management behavior ( e.g. , adjust medication , alter activity level , alter surround environment seek medical assistance ) well provider ' decision related appropriate treatment course step , change step therapy . Thus , current guideline National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) Expert Panel Review 3 ( EPR3 ) highlight importance ongoing symptom monitoring . Studies child raise concern adequacy effectiveness current method asthma self-monitoring include symptom-based peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) monitoring . Symptom-based monitoring relies individual 's symptom perception subjective influence variety factor patient 's emotional status , social influence ( e.g , family , peer ) previous experience symptom . Thus , accuracy objectivity monitoring method uncertain . As objective approach , PEF monitoring encourage , yet efficacy method also subject ongoing debate literature . Poor adherence inadequate technique diminish clinical usefulness PEF monitoring . Thus , uncertainty current monitoring strategy underscore imperative alternative symptom monitoring strategy address issue accuracy objectivity symptom assessment . Adolescence important period consolidate establish self-management adjustment chronic health condition . Yet array developmental challenge include desire normalcy peer approval , feeling invulnerability emerge independence undermine adolescent ' motivation behavior engage self-management present particular difficulty achieve optimal asthma control adolescents asthma . Parents become less able manage asthma child reach adolescence many researcher clinician report similar difficulty manage asthma adolescent primarily due inadequate adherence counterproductive behavior . Thus , clinician face serious challenge provide optimal management adolescent asthma primarily due difficulty solicit patient ' active partnership asthma management sustainable reliable symptom monitoring routine . Accurate symptom monitoring patient fundamental antecedent effective asthma management , yet exist monitoring strategy conducive adolescent ' cooperation yield accurate clinically useful information . Having recognize limitation , study examine innovative strategy monitor asthma symptom stimulate adolescent ' partnership ultimately lead effective asthma management . The device directly monitor chosen parameter asthma symptom , include wheezing , cough activity level . A mobile phone employ platform processing , analyze store data transmit microphone wireless accelerometer . This new approach developmentally appropriate , give adolescent ' affinity technology capacity address adolescent ' need maintain normalcy allow continuous asthma monitor real-life situation . The device involve biomedical engineering technique enable automatic sound activity recording , analysis , feedback , storage function . A mobile phone employ platform processing , analyze store data transmit microphone wireless accelerometer . This technology automate daily symptom monitoring minimal intrusiveness maximum accuracy , thereby reduce risk inappropriate treatment ameliorate asthma-related disability . Due foreseen safety , noninvasiveness , objectivity , convenience , user-friendliness , cost containment , approach greatly enhance asthma management adolescent health care provider . This device potential bring patient behavior change avoid trigger adjust medication device provide opportunity in-time review symptom .</detailed_description>
