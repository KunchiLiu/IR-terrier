	<brief_summary>This phase II step-wise , randomize , multicenter , double-blind control clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity attenuate tetravalent lyophilized dengue vaccine manufacture Butantan Institute . Three Clinical Sites University Sao Paulo - Brazil participate study . A total 300 volunteer recruit divide two step : Step A ( previous exposure dengue ) Step B ( without previous exposure dengue ) . In step A participant assign receive either lyophilized vaccine , liquid vaccine ( developed NIH produce formulate Butantan accord NIH-Protocol ) , placebo . In Step B participant assign receive either lyophilized vaccine , placebo . Both vaccine formulation ( lyophilize liquid ) compose attenuated virus : rDEN1∆30 , rDEN2/4∆30 ( ME ) , rDEN3∆30/31 , rDEN4∆30 . At end study , 20 volunteer receive liquid formulation ( NIH ) , 210 lyophilize formulation ( Butantan ) , 70 receive placebo . All participant include step follow period five year inclusion study . The study hypothesis investigational lyophilized dengue vaccine manufacture Butantan Institute safe confers balance immune response , one dose 1000PFU , vaccine virus .</brief_summary>
