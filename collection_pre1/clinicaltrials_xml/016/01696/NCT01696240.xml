	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Udenafil Therapy Patients With Mild Pulmonary Hypertension ULTIMATE-Mild PHT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension devastate progressive disease increasingly debilitate symptom . In past year , treatment pulmonary hypertension undergone extraordinary evolution . A selective PDE-5 inhibitor , Sildenafil , show effective pulmonary vasodilator inhale NO patient primary pulmonary hypertension recently show improve exercise capacity , rest hemodynamics , WHO functional class patient pulmonary hypertension . However , date , effect Sildenafil mainly study patient advanced disease . Udenafil ( Zydena ) , newly develop PDE-5 inhibitor , prove similar efficacy safety profile , compare PDE-5 inhibitor . However , date , effect Udenafil mild pulmonary HT never evaluate . Therefore , hypothesize Udenafil , newly develop phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor , would improve symptom , exercise capacity hemodynamic status patient mild pulmonary hypertension . In 12-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , patient mild pulmonary hypertension enrol accord eligibility criterion . After randomization , study participant assign receive either 50mg Udenafil placebo two time day 4 week , dosage double 100mg two time day next 8 week . Participants attend study visit baseline week 4 12 . Physical examination , medical history review , blood sample collection electrocardiogram conduct study visit . At baseline week 12 , participant undergo cardiopulmonary exercise test exercise echocardiography . At every study visit , researcher collect health information .</detailed_description>
