	<brief_title>A Neoadjuvant Study Androgen Ablation Combined With Cyclophosphamide GVAX Vaccine Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer immunotherapy refers broadly approach attempt treat cancer activate immune response direct malignant tissue . Prostate GVAX allogeneic cell-based prostate cancer vaccine compose two irradiate cell line ( PC3 LNCaP ) genetically modify secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . The release GM-CSF modify tumor cell serve recruit dendritic cell present tumor antigens T-cells , thus initiate antitumor immune response . However , abundant preclinical data show , use alone , cell-based immunotherapy unable break specific T-cell tolerance tumor-bearing host . Studies autochthonous prostate cancer mouse model show give low-dose cyclophosphamide prior cell-based GM-CSF-secreting vaccine abrogate immune tolerance augmentation CD8+ T cell infiltration prostate , transient depletion regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , increased expression dendritic cell maturation marker . Enhancement antitumor immunity also observe preclinical model cyclophosphamide give sequence GM-CSF-secreting immunotherapy treatment breast pancreatic cancer . These preclinical data support early-phase clinical trial combine GVAX low-dose cyclophosphamide pancreatic breast cancer . Furthermore , emerge evidence suggest androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) profound effect host immune system , result thymic regeneration enhancement antitumor immunity . In addition , preclinical clinical study demonstrate ADT augments prostate cancer-specific immune response induce immunotherapy , suggest ADT may act synergistically immunotherapy . Based data mouse model well human clinical trial , suggest prostate cancer immunotherapy may effective administer set androgen-suppressed environment . Building finding , investigator design study ass use ADT give alone administer follow immunization low-dose cyclophosphamide prostate GVAX , patient undergo radical prostatectomy . Investigators aim ( 1 ) determine whether ADT immunogenic men localize prostate cancer evaluate T-cell infiltration harvest prostate gland ; ( 2 ) determine whether administer ADT low-dose cyclophosphamide prostate GVAX augments immune infiltration prostate gland ; ( 3 ) investigate whether combinatorial immuno-hormonal approach safe feasible . Investigators hypothesize combination ADT cyclophosphamide/GVAX produce significantly great antitumor immune response would ADT use alone .</detailed_description>
