	<brief_summary>Despite many year research , incomprehensible amount scientific effort worldwide billion dollar invest , effective therapy result major neurological functional recovery available date traumatic spinal cord injury ( tSCI ) . Although increase experimental evidence animal model surgical decompression spinal cord improve recovery tSCI , clinical study show conclusive data yet . The main explanation lack convince evidence relatively small sample size previous study , predominantly retrospective nature , suboptimal measurement method assessment neurological deficit , inappropriate record documentation potential confounding factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although injury spinal column represent relatively small proportion traumatic injury , spinal injury one high impact functional outcome employment status . Even injury spinal column , traumatic spinal cord injury ( tSCI ) devastate disorder severely affect patient ' physical psychosocial well-being . The incidence tSCI estimate 11 53 new case per million population per year . This multi-center , prospective , observational cohort study evaluate early ( ≤ 12 hour tSCI ) surgical decom¬pression superior late ( &gt; 12 hour &lt; 14 day tSCI ) improve neurologic motor outcomes patient acute traumatic spinal cord injury . The study enroll 300 patient anticipated 1:2 ratio early vs. late surgery . This CIP limit cervical spinal cord injury , consider diagnostic MRI mandatory conduct European setting patient generally transport swiftly treat institution compare geographic region world . Patients evaluate accord schedule set forth CIP . The schedule include evaluation pre-surgery , post-surgery , 72 hour post injury , 12 week ± 2 week ; 6 month ± 30 day ; 1 year ± 30 day . The enrollment period expect approximately 36 month subject followed-up 12 month evaluation primary endpoint . The study duration approximately 48 month .</detailed_description>
