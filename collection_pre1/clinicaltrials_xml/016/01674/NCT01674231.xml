	<brief_summary>The investigator hope learn effect whole grape , form freeze-dried grape powder , marker health . Phytochemical rich food consumption associate protection chronic diseases cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) demonstrate ability modify endothelial function lipemia , exact causal mechanism still well understood . The investigator examine metabolic mechanistic effect consumption whole grape powder chronic well acute setting response meal challenge test blood sample determine marker health improve . The central hypothesis project consumption grape form polyphenol-rich freeze-dried whole grape powder ( WGP ) attenuate chronic meal induce oxidative stress inflammatory responses obese individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim : 1 . Assess effect WGP compare placebo biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation obese subject 4 week intervention period randomize , cross-over , double-blind study . 2 . Determine effect WGP compare placebo lipid apolipoprotein parameter , biomarkers endothelial dysfunction , obese subject . 3 . Investigate characterize effect WGP compare placebo mononuclear cell ( MNC ) obese subject response oxidative challenge high fat , high carbohydrate ( HFHC ) meal examine monocyte index oxidant stress-related transcription factor downstream gene target . Health promotion prevention chronic diseases face continue obesity epidemic press public health issue today . Epidemiologic evidence support protective effect plant food-rich dietary pattern , inverse relationship fruit vegetable consumption chronic condition like cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . However , underlie causal mechanism well understood . Prospective human study examine consumption polyphenol-rich whole grape component find benefit marker oxidative stress blood lipid food example blackcurrant juice strawberry . Putative mechanism underlie positive action polyphenol-rich grape well describe recent review . A number in-vitro cell culture in-vivo animal study WGP extract support mechanism . However , relatively few human study conduct examine biomarkers potential mechanism attenuation chronic inflammatory response meal-induced postprandial oxidative stress inflammation obese human . Obesity metabolic state recognize pro-inflammatory , lead dysregulation endothelial function , glucose lipoprotein metabolism cardiovascular risk . Consumption high fat diet impair vascular reactivity postprandial period . Circulating MNC provide representation overall inflammatory status body , accessible use examine mechanistic process response chronic meal-induced oxidative stress . Recent literature report describe effect polyphenol-rich food consumption Mediterranean diet pattern reduce NF-ÎºB activation well change downstream inflammatory gene expression peripheral blood MNC 's . Therefore , propose study exploit approach examine short-term response meal challenge well longer-term response daily consumption whole grape assess plasma mononuclear cell index . This research shed light oxidant stress-related transcription factor downstream gene target involve anti-inflammatory effect grape consumption obese individual increase risk chronic disease . Additional scientific data need understand link diet health develop effective dietary strategy improve health outcome , particularly obesity . The use polyphenol-rich whole grape powder attenuate inflammatory mediator biomarkers blood mononuclear cell obese human represent target intervention approach at-risk population . The goal study examine link beneficial effect grape food health significant public health chronic disease . The outcome study design provide preliminary data bridge well-controlled human translational research fundamental research examine cellular response grape consumption human clinical trial . The approach generate new unique data extend scientific knowledge allow development mechanistic component human feed intervention .</detailed_description>
