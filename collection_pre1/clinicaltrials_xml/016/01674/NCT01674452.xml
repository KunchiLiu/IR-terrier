	<detailed_description>1 . Program Development : 27 exercise select , base frequent motor alteration present hemiparesis . Three mode create exercise : assist active , active resist active execution . Besides explanatory text , illustrative photo exercise mode . 2 . Program Execution : All group submit motor evaluation utilize Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) functional evaluation utilize Functional independence measure ( FIM ) . After assessment , patient home-based exercise group ( HBG ) group home exercise select patient ; exercise explain perform one one . The home-exercises re-executed fortnightly visit , necessary correction make . The next step stipulate manual take , provide patient complex exercise accord progress . The patient supervise exercise train group ( SEG ) participate supervised individual exercise session two time per week . A physical therapist supervise session . Exercise session include : 30 minute global exercise involve stretching , range motion , muscle strengthen another 30 minute functional training ( gait , balance use arm daily activity ) .The control group ( CG ) assess reluctant unable regularly attend supervised exercise program . The group reassess six month . 3 . Program assessment : The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score Functional independence measure score , measure baseline six month , compare group .</detailed_description>
