	<brief_summary>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) spontaneous intestinal perforation ( SIP ) common devastate gastrointestinal disease premature infant . These infant often need surgical intervention remove dead bowel create temporary enterostomy , result short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) , malabsorption state due insufficient bowel length dysfunction digest absorb nutrient adequately . These infant often nourish primarily parental nutrition ( PN ) lead many complication include PN-associated liver disease . However , enteral feeding , remain bowel adapt somewhat shorten state , reduce need PN . Enteral fat appear trophic macronutrients long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) beneficial promote bowel adaptation . Fish oil ( FO ) , main source n-3 LCPUFA , show promote bowel adaptation . Microlipid ( ML ) primarily contain n-6 PUFA find decrease ostomy output increase weight gain SBS infant . WThe investigator soon complete randomized clinical trial ( EMLFO trial ) ( WFUHS IRB00011501 , NCT01306838 ) entitle `` Early Supplementation Enteral Lipid Combination Microlipid Fish Oil Infants Enterostomies '' . The preliminary data suggest ( ) supplement enteral ML/FO , able decrease use IL ; ( b ) premature infant treatment group receive ML/FO achieve high enteral calorie ( % total calorie ) intake reanastomosis well weight gain ( g/day ) reanastomosis receive routine care control group ; ( c ) direct bilirubin level reanastomosis tend low treatment group control group although difference statistically significant . Because intervention consist increase enteral fat intake well specific type fat intake ( i.e . FO ) , unclear whether improve outcome ML/FO group attributable FO 's anti-inflammatory effect increase fat intake . Therefore , investigator design next randomized clinical trial compare ML alone versus ML plus FO . We hypothesize compare ML alone , ML plus FO result decrease systemic inflammation , indicate blood level inflammation-related protein indicator oxidative stress .</brief_summary>
