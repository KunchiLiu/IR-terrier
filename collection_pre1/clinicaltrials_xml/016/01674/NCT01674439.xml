	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Fat Grafts Supplemented With Adipose-derived Regenerative Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To overcome problem associate fat grafting , unpredictable clinical result low rate graft survival , many innovative effort refinement surgical technique report . For example , condensation live tissue removal unnecessary component perform centrifugation , filtration gravity sedimentation ; external mechanical force use expand recipient tissue well overlie skin envelope ; recent experimental study suggest repeated local injection erythropoietin might enhance retention graft fat . Based find aspirated fat tissue contains much small number adipose-derived regenerative cell ( ADRC ) compare intact tissue cell play pivotal role adipose tissue remodel lipoinjection , supplementation fat graft stromal vascular fraction isolate adipose portion liposuction aspirate propose method compensate relative deficiency ADRC . In literature , least three experimental study demonstrate supplementation adipose progenitor cell enhance volume weight survive adipose tissue , first report clinical use ADRC suggest approach may feasible effective soft tissue augmentation . However , since study represent level evidence IV , correspond publication case series , lack randomize , control clinical trial compare method current standard technique . Hence , study aim fill gap investigate whether novel protocol isolation ADRC use combination fat tissue improve long-term retention graft patient craniofacial microsomia .</detailed_description>
