	<brief_summary>Hardening artery ( atherosclerosis ) common disorder cause heart attack stroke . PET CT contrast-enhanced MRI scan two new way assess atherosclerosis . The investigator propose perform PET CT MRI scan patient harden neck artery due undergo surgery remove harden area . The investigator able compare hot spot find scan investigator see remove specimen microscope laboratory . This give investigator insight value PET CT MRI tool assess atherosclerosis . It also provide investigator new information relate underlying process give rise atherosclerosis pave way future development new treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hardening artery ( atherosclerosis ) common health problem lead fatal disable heart attack stroke . On many level , remain incompletely understood illness . Until relatively recently , way assess severity , risk pose , atherosclerosis measure degree narrow particular blood vessel . This method tell part story ; investigator know frequently 'culprit area ' atherosclerosis cause heart attack stroke necessarily result narrow blood vessel - i.e . investigator measure narrowness investigator miss lot 'bad ' atherosclerosis . As , press need identify sophisticate technique assess disease order people high risk heart attack stroke identify early offer appropriate preventative treatment . Techniques provide extra information could also significantly shorten time take get new treatment drug market provide faster cost-effective way assess treatment early development . Furthermore , explore new technique reflect accurately go within atherosclerosis body , deep insight condition gain . This turn lead development new treatment . PET/CT scan USPIO ( kind tracer ) enhance MRI scan two technique demonstrate particular promise . These scan method provide information composition architecture atherosclerosis provide data process ( chemical cellular level ) underlie disease . Inflammation calcification ( deposit calcium ) two biological process know important genesis atherosclerosis . PET/CT USPIO enhance MRI detect process . Most strokes mini-strokes cause narrow neck artery . If patient mini-stroke stroke narrowing ( atherosclerosis ) carotid artery normally offer operation remove atherosclerosis ( endarterectomy ) , piece atherosclerosis normally discard . This scenario afford perfect opportunity explore new scan technique . The investigator propose explore feasibility value use PET/CT ( use 18F-FDG 18F-NaF - two tracer know highlight inflammation calcification ) USPIO enhance MRI assess atherosclerosis . The investigator scan patient mini-stroke minor stroke due undergo endarterectomy . The investigator able define go level gene cell cause 'hot spot ' CT/PET MRI .</detailed_description>
