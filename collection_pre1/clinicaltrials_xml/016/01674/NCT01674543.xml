	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia severe mental illness , psychosis prevalent society , affect 1 % population . The treatment schizophrenia basically do antipsychotic drug , although non-pharmacological intervention , exercise , form treatment seem consider . Among recommended exercise general population , investigator highlight aerobic resistance exercise . However , study report positive effect aerobic exercise pathogenesis schizophrenia . In relation resistance exercise concurrent training , unknown effect patient disease , especially one considers junction two type exercise train session ( call concurrent training ) . However , know , clinical study animal model , exercise modifies brain improve neuroplasticity , mental condition individual frame reverse neurodegeneration . Associated improvement schizophrenia , clinical trial aerobic exercise show improvement disease symptom , reduce anxiety depression , clinical global improvement . The hypothesis type propose training , resistance training concurrent training improve clinical symptom disease , improve side effect cause drug . It believe clinical change accompany increased serum IGF-1 resistance training aerobic training BDNF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia serious mental disease characterize combination positive negative symptom , associate social occupational dysfunction . The positive symptom reflect excess distortion normal function ( delusion , hallucination disorganize behavior ) , whereas negative symptom relate flattened affect , alogia , avolition decrease cognitive function . One recent study report schizophrenia associate distortion reality , change perception thought , difficulty social situation problem daily function . Schizophrenia generally appear end adolescence begin adulthood affect approximately 1 % population . The disease deteriorate course involve large neurological change . Its etiology may explain interaction factor associate genetic susceptibility adverse environmental factor . Recently , hypothesize alteration neuroplasticity may important factor development schizophrenia . IGF-1 important growth factor induces neuroplasticity ( neuronal survival , cell differentiation , cell proliferation , synaptic plasticity neurogenesis ) . Schizophrenic patient low serum IGF-1 level healthy individual . Because IGF-1 level low schizophrenic patient associate etiology disease , important investigate treatment may increase serum IGF-1 . Antipsychotic drug olanzapine stimulate phosphorylation AKT , part main downstream pathway IGF-1 . It possible activate AKT several intracellular signal receptor , include activation insulin receptor ( IR ) . However , activation IGF-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) appear main activator AKT phosphorylation . In addition antipsychotic medication , resistance exercise may another way increase IGF-1 concentration . This type physical exercise grow popularity society . In recent year , evidence show benefit exercise different age group healthy sick individual , indicate augment bone mineral mass , strength muscular mass ; prevent treat sarcopenia ; decrease frailty functional impairment ; improve cognitive function hypertension , among benefit . Studies conduct young elderly underwent resistance train show increased serum IGF-1 level . However , study show effect resistance training concurrent training schizophrenia serum IGF-1 level perform . Studying physical exercise important several reason . Importantly , low-cost treatment may possible therapeutic tool , increase IGF-1 concentration also decrease disease symptom , especially negative symptom , side effect antipsychotic drug ( extrapyramidal effect , weight gain tiredness ) , may improve quality life . Therefore , aim study evaluate effect 20 week resistance training concurrent training psychotic depressive symptom , quality life serum IGF-1 concentration .</detailed_description>
