	<brief_summary>Patients Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) traditionally receive bed rest part care . They develop muscle weakness even day mechanical ventilation may prolong time ICU hospital , nature weakness poorly understood . The weakness develop ICU substantial would result bed rest alone refer ICU acquire weakness ( ICUAW ) . This weakness might due combination inflammation immobility . The exact mechanism lead nerve muscle damage occur critical illness yet fully understood require investigation . However , know ICUAW effect patient 's ability breathe without ventilator , walk perform simple activity ( like wash toileting ) often result longer mechanical ventilation time hence , long hospital stay might otherwise expect . It may also affect patient 's ability return home hospital stay . The recovery period Australian New Zealand ICU patient unknown trial Canada report ongoing weakness five year leave ICU . Weakness survivor intensive care know substantial problem . It currently know whether ICUAW may avoid severity reduce simple strategy early exercise ICU . There data level activity mobility critically ill patient Australian New Zealand ICUs . These data urgently required plan program research test whether increase level mobility activity critically ill patient safe , feasible efficacious term reduce severity ICUAW improve patient-centred outcome . The program research first include study observe mobility level 25 ICUs across Australia New Zealand determine safety , barrier mobility type activity undertaken patient . From observational data plan develop pilot randomise control trial early mobility activity intensive care unit across Australia New Zealand . This simple , cost-effective strategy may improve functional ability , decrease time mechanical ventilation improve long term outcomes patient group . By initiate program , ANZ investigator might able change future patient outcome worldwide .</brief_summary>
