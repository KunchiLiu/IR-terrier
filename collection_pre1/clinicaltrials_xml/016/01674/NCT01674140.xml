	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen citrate , goserelin acetate , leuprolide acetate , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane , may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether hormone therapy effective give without everolimus treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well give hormone therapy together without everolimus work treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1207 Hormone Therapy With Without Everolimus Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare whether addition one year everolimus ( 10 mg daily ) standard adjuvant endocrine therapy improve invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) patient high-risk , hormone-receptor ( HR ) -positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2-negative breast cancer . Secondary - To compare whether addition one year everolimus standard adjuvant endocrine therapy improve overall survival ( OS ) distant recurrence-free survival ( DRFS ) patient population . - To evaluate safety , toxicity , tolerability one year everolimus combination standard adjuvant endocrine therapy compare standard adjuvant endocrine therapy plus placebo patient population . - To determine whether benefit one year everolimus use addition standard adjuvant endocrine therapy varies recurrence score ( RS ) , nodal status , commonly use prognostic factor . - To evaluate adherence 1-year treatment everolimus comparison placebo addition standard adjuvant endocrine therapy patient population . - To collect specimen order evaluate biomarkers therapeutic efficacy . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord risk level ( node-negative recurrence score [ RS ] &gt; 25 primary tumor , tumor measure ≥ 2 cm great diameter treat adjuvant therapy v 1-3 positive lymph node RS &gt; 25 treated adjuvant therapy v ≥ 4 positive lymph node [ RS value ] treat adjuvant therapy v ≥ 4 positive lymph node [ RS value ] prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive approve endocrine therapy comprise tamoxifen citrate* , goserelin acetate** leuprolide acetate** , aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ) 2-5 year . Patients also receive placebo orally ( PO ) daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive approve endocrine therapy regimen arm I . Patients also receive everolimus PO daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Men receive tamoxifen citrate PO 5 year . NOTE : **Goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate give patient becomes postmenopausal . Blood tissue sample collect biomarker study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year yearly thereafter 10 year .</detailed_description>
