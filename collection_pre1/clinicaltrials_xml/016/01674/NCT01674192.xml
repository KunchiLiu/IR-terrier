	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics single 2 mg oral dose prucalopride subject various degree renal impairment compare normal renal function monitor safety profile prucalopride subject renal impairment . Hypothesis : Prucalopride might accumulate exhibit different pharmacokinetic profile renally impaired subject compare normal population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prucalopride Subjects With Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open label , single-dose , pharmacokinetic trial prucalopride subject vary degree renal impairment . Subjects classify one four renal function group , define 24-hour creatinine clearance determination ( CRCL ) obtain within 2 week trial entry . Each subject administer single 2mg oral dose prucalopride . Plasma sample complete urine collection obtain 0 120 h ( 6 day ) dose characterize pharmacokinetics prucalopride .</detailed_description>
