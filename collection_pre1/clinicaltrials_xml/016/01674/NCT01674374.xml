	<brief_title>Botanical Therapy Treating Mucositis Patients With Head Neck Cancer Who Have Undergone Chemoradiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess tolerability SAMITAL granules suspension . II . To assess efficacy SAMITAL granules suspension reduce incidence severe mucositis ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] mucositis scale score 3 4 ) induce concurrent chemoradiation head neck cancer ( HNC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect SAMITAL granules suspension severity duration mucositis ( WHO mucositis scale patient self-assessment Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire [ OMDQ ] ) . II . To assess effect SAMITAL granules suspension validate patient report quality life measure ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer [ EORTC ] Quality Life Questionnaire [ QLQ ] -C30 EORTC QLQ Head Neck Cancer Specific Module ) . III . To assess rate grade 3 - grade 4 infection . IV . To assess cumulative dose opioids need . V. To assess weight loss need tube feed . VI . To assess treatment break and/or chemotherapy dose reduction . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Beginning soon symptom arise chemoradiotherapy , patient receive Vaccinium myrtillus extract/Macleaya cordata alkaloids/Echinacea angustifolia extract granule orally ( PO ) four time daily ( QID ) . Patients may continue receive Vaccinium myrtillus extract/Macleaya cordata alkaloids/Echinacea angustifolia extract granule 4 week completion radiation therapy maximum 11 week . ARM II : Beginning soon symptom arise chemoradiotherapy , patient receive placebo PO QID . Patients may continue receive placebo 4 week completion radiation therapy maximum 11 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
