	<brief_summary>Activity pacing ( AP ) commonly use treatment people chronic pain . Many people pain try continue daily activity level able manage pain . This way cop cause increase pain ; become discourage give activity . AP treatment involve help regulate activity level achieve important life goal . Although AP widely use , effectiveness still unproven . There two key approach : The operant learning ( OL ) approach use quota related time goal person set . The energy conservation ( EC ) approach focus balance patient energy expenditure . Both treatment often used people Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) , common pain condition . We examine effect treatment pain , fatigue , quality life , physical functioning mental well-being . We also investigate whether factor influence treatment effectiveness ( e.g. , person 's readiness change , pain intensity level ) . 120 FMS patient randomly assign receive OL , EC , Delayed-OL Delayed-EC . Data collect baseline , end treatment 3 , 6 12 month follow-up . FMS patient recruit consecutively Rheumatologists St. Joseph 's Health Care London . OL EC treatment manual develop expert field intervention give two occupational therapist 3 month period `` stand-alone '' intervention ( 10 session 120 min ) . All session record order ass intervention fidelity . This study first base AP intervention clearly delineate theoretical framework . It clarify whether AP strategy benefit individual FMS whether either two approach effective . Our result help direct clinical resource fund toward beneficial intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Operant Learning Versus Energy Conservation Activity Pacing Treatments Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational : Activity pacing ( AP ) define `` regulation activity level and/or rate service goal goal '' ( Nielson , Jensen et Vlaeyen , 2012 ) . This general coping strategy widely use chronic pain ( CP ) management stand-alone treatment component multimodal treatment program . However potential benefit remain unproven ; fact , evidence context , pace may maladaptive cop response ( Gill et Brown , 2009 ) . Thus , knowledge regard effect cop strategy need order determine ( ) effective pain management treatment . Two model AP currently widespread use . The Operant Learning ( OL ) approach use positively reinforced activity quota time and/or goal contingent , rather pain-contingent , gradually increase use `` activity-rest '' cycling ( Fordyce , 1976 ) . In contrast , Energy Conservation ( EC ) approach focus patient energy expenditure , seek achieve balance accomplish important day-to-day activity rest order reduce avoid pain fatigue ( Hammond , 2004 ) . Despite ubiquitous use two form AP clinical setting , little know either individual relative efficacy . Similarly , approach involve multiple element , unclear element might responsible putative treatment effect . Two recent study ( Murphy et al. , 2011 ; van Koulil et al. , 2010 ) provide data regard AP , describe somewhat contradictory result provide clear theoretical base intervention . Future research concern effectiveness AP : ( ) define content intervention base theory ; ( b ) avoid confound AP non-AP treatment element ; ( c ) examine relative efficacy two theoretically different AP methodology ; ( ) identify clinical population likely benefit AP treatment . Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) condition general population prevalence approximately 3-5 % estimate one high psychosocial financial impact rheumatic disease chronic pain condition . The predominant symptom FMS chronic widespread pain fatigue . Although disease-modifying treatment available condition , Cognitive Behavioural Multidisciplinary Treatment Programs , usually include form AP , evidence-based widely recommend . Because FMS common , cause considerable suffering ( personal , social economic ) frequent target AP method , particularly important understand efficacy AP - alone part multimodal treatment package . However , step take , important ass efficacy AP stand-alone treatment . Research objectives : - To examine effectiveness relative benefit OL EC intervention pain fatigue assess impact physical functioning , mental well-being quality life patient FMS . - To investigate factor hypothesize influence AP treatment effectiveness , include use general coping strategy beliefs/attitudes toward pain . - To Examine AP treatment regard participant global impression change group session follow-up . Methodology : The present study design accord CONSORT ( Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ) statement . A total 120 participant FMS randomly assign one four intervention group ( OL , EC , delayed-OL delayed-EC ) . The delayed group receive AP intervention 3 month later serve Usual Care control group . All group continue receive concomitant intervention receive ( pharmacological non-pharmacological ) time enrollment . Data collect pretreatment assessment ( T0 , ) end intervention group ( 3 month , T1 ) , 3 month ( T2 ) 6 month ( T3 ) booster session 12 month ( T4 ) follow-up . In order obtain heterogeneous sample representative regional FMS population , participant recruit different source include health professional primary tertiary care setting , FMS association support group direct solicitation community ( e.g. , newspaper , poster ) . Patients invite call AP research phone line interested participating study . If accept provide write informed consent , randomly assign one two study condition ( delay delay ) . Men ( around 5 % FMS population ) randomize separately order insure similar proportion sex include four study group . All participant blind nature research question involve study . Sample size calculation : This sample size determine base standard effect size calculation ( Machin et Fayers , 2010 ) use effect size estimate obtain previous , related , study intervention FMS ( Murphy et al. , 2011 ; van Koulil et al. , 2010 ) take account attrition rate 20 % . This calculation result estimate 60 participant per group ( OL , EC ) . Specifically , base estimate data obtain FMS patient refer Rheumatology Day Program St. Joseph Health Care representative population sample recruit study . FMS patient ' refer program report average pain 7.11 10 numerical rating scale within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 1.41 . We plan use two primary outcome measure ( 0-10 numerical rating scale pain fatigue ) . Because between-group difference non-pharmacological trial small , chose between-group difference 1 NRS measure estimate . If true difference OL EC mean 1 , need total 51 participant ' per group able show one treatment effective power ( 1-β ) 0.9 . The Type I error probability associate test α/2 ( correct 2 primary outcome : pain fatigue ) 0.025 . We estimate require 20.4 additional participant ( 20 % ) adjust study attrition , result total 120 participant . Interventions : OL EC treatment manual develop two experienced clinical psychologist two occupational therapist . They base theoretical underpinnings two principal AP intervention . An expert panel 6 select researcher extensive experience particular field revise rate manual content accordingly Nielson et al . ( Nielson , Jensen et Vlaeyen , 2012 ) review paper activity pace concept chronic pain . This ensure content treatment manual consistent conceptual model underlie OL EC intervention . These treatment apply 3 month `` stand-alone '' intervention include 10 session , 120 min duration ( 1-weekly 2 month , 2 every two week 1 month ) . Booster session also conduct 3 , 6 12 month follow-up . Both intervention administer two well-trained occupational therapist ( OTs ) , extensive clinical experience treat individual FMS . All treatment session audio-recorded . Thirty percent record session randomly select review two blinded assessor ( use criterion inter-rater reliability , Cohen 's κ , &gt; .80 ) order evaluate : 1 ) therapeutic alliance ( 7-points Likert scale ) , 2 ) treatment fidelity ( therapist adherence treatment manual ) ( 7-point Likert scale ) . Questionnaires assessment tool : Questionnaires measurement tool choose accord IMMPACT ( Initiative Methods , Measurement , Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ) OMERACT ( Outcome Measures Rheumatology Clinical Trials ) recommendation . Socio-demographic data information concurrent treatment collect baseline participant 's global impression change measure follow-up . All others questionnaire complete baseline ( T0 ) , intervention ( T1 ) booster session ( T2 , T3 , T4 ) . Delayed intervention group complete T0 3 month baseline start intervention . Statistical analysis : A split-plot factorial design serve basis study . A first set analysis ( t-tests , chi-squares ) perform evaluate possible baseline difference OL , EC Delayed group outcome and/or demographic measure . Depending result analysis , repeat measure ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ) ANOVA ( ANCOVA significant between-group difference baseline measure , e.g . baseline pain ) conduct compare three study group primary outcome measure . Similarly , repeat measure ANOVAs ( and/or ANCOVAs ) use evaluate secondary tertiary outcome measure . Post-hoc multiple comparison conduct evaluate simple simple-simple effect , correct number comparison . Secondary objective evaluate use multiple regression analysis examine relationship treatment change propose predictor variable . Contributions : The propose study important first step evaluate efficacy two commonly use AP strategy understand relationship variable influence treatment outcome . This study also first base AP intervention clearly delineate theoretical framework . Assuming one form AP show beneficial effect treatment outcome , subsequent research able refine content AP intervention . The result also clarify appropriateness use AP strategy individual FMS provide information ( ) two approach provide clinical benefit . Finally , research also important implication health care resource allocation expenditure . From perspective evidence-based practice , clinical resource fund direct toward identify beneficial intervention .</detailed_description>
