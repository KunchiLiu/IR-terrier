	<detailed_description>Calcineurin Inhibitors ( CNIs ) Renal Fibrosis . CNIs include CsA tacrolimus cornerstone maintenance immunosuppression solid organ transplantation . These drug effective new generation CNIs Voclosporin ( Isotechnika Pharma , Inc , Edmonton , Alberta ) development . They play immunosuppressive role inhibit activity calcineurin , serine phosphatase normally dephosphorylates nuclear factor activate T cell ( NFAT ) . Dephosphorylated NFAT translocates nucleus induces transcription interleukin-2 , important cytokine activation proliferation T-lymphocytes . Despite beneficial action transplantation many autoimmune disorder , clinical use CNIs limit chronic nephrotoxicity . This represent significant public health problem since 10-year incidence chronic CNI nephrotoxicity 100 % renal transplant recipient . Similarly , chronic CNI nephrotoxicity dominant causative factor kidney failure nonkidney organ transplant recipient . In group , 5-year risk ESRD range 7 21 % associate 4-time great risk death . The pathological feature chronic CNI nephrotoxicity include progressive irreversible interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy arteriolar hyaline change . De novo progressive arteriolar hyaline thickening ( AH ) pathognomonic lesion chronic CNI nephrotoxicity . This lesion consist vacuolization endothelial smooth muscle cell focal circular lumpy protein deposit arteriolar wall , usually replace necrotic smooth muscle cell eventually narrow vascular lumen . This arteriolopathy important development fibrosis . Typically , fibrosis follow `` strip pattern '' medulla cortex associate vacuolization cytoplasm tubular epithelial cell . Although tacrolimus superior CsA improve graft survival prevent acute rejection kidney transplantation , individual nephrotoxicity profile drug similar . At cellular molecular level , CNIs result matrix accumulation EMT via TGF-beta1 dependent independent pathway . EMT important profibrotic process surrogate marker native transplant kidney fibrosis . TGF-beta1 primary cytokine initiate maintains EMT activate signal pathway transcriptional regulator Smad 2/3 molecule . During EMT , tubular epithelial cell transform myofibroblasts stepwise process involve loss cell-cell adhesion molecule ( e.g . E-cadherin ) de novo expression mesenchymal marker ( e.g . alpha-SMA ) . These event follow tubular basement membrane disruption , cell migration fibroblast invasion interstitium production profibrotic molecule include collagen fibronectin . A good understanding molecular mechanism regulate CNIinduced EMT fibrosis pave way development antifibrotic strategy . Objective evaluation renal fibrosis vivo key step direction . This recently achieve quantitative assessment renal allograft fibrosis use computerized digital analysis Sirius Red . These study show fibrosis prognostic indicator long-term kidney allograft function loss . However , role technology predict outcome patient chronic CNI toxicity unknown . CNIs Renal Hypoxia . Accumulating evidence suggest chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia final common pathway end-stage renal disease . CNIs result decrease nitric oxide ( NO ) production bioavailability , thereby lead decrease vasodilation unopposed vasoconstriction hypoxia . In chronic setting , CNI-mediated arteriolopathy narrow arteriolar lumen contribute development strip interstitial fibrosis , loss peritubular capillary , tubular atrophy glomerular sclerosis . In turn , hypoxia tubulointerstitial compartment may lead formation free radical reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) cause cellular injury death , promote EMT renal fibrosis , set train vicious cycle end end-stage renal disease . A good understanding cellular molecular mechanism result CNI-induced renal hypoxia would lead development diagnostic treatment strategy delay prevent CNI-induced renal fibrosis . A major limitation study address intrarenal oxygenation lack noninvasive technology quantitate monitor bioavailability oxygen kidney . Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI BOLD MRI innovative imaging method use deoxyhemoglobin endogenous contrast agent determine tissue oxygen bioavailability . The relationship paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin T2 relaxation first demonstrate 1982 . This technique recently use , include group , assess intra-renal oxygen bioavailability patient native transplant kidney disease . We propose use technology monitor intrarenal oxygenation patient chronic CNI toxicity . We suggest combine BOLD MRI molecular assessment renal hypoxia . Hypoxia Inducible Factor one alpha oxygen response system recently use molecular marker renal hypoxia . HIF molecule regulate protein level oxygen-dependent enzyme therefore allow tissue hypoxia detection . In kidney allograft example , strong correlation HIF-1alpha stain clinical/subclinical rejection suggest hypoxia involved pathogenesis immune-mediated renal injury HIF-1 alpha immunohistochemistry could enhance specific diagnosis acute rejection . Pimonidazole also molecular biomarker hypoxia deliver vivo , bind thiol group oxygen tension 10 mmHg visualize commercially available antipimonidazole antibody . It small , effective nontoxic radiosensitizer use hypoxia marker human squamous cell carcinoma cervix , head , neck . In kidney , pimonidazole staining use examine tissue hypoxia experimental model chronic renal disease acute CNI nephrotoxicity . The role BOLD MRI , HIF-1 alpha pimonidazole evaluate mechanism chronic CNI-induced hypoxia evaluate . CNIs Nox2 . CsA pro-oxidant molecule support experimental study suggest vitamin E inhibit CsA-induced lipid peroxidation renal damage . Similarly , catalase , enzyme specifically breaks reactive hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) H2O O2 act scavenger ROS , reduce CsA-associated renal tubular epithelial cell senescence . In addition , rat proximal tubular epithelial cell expose CsA accumulate intracellular ROS lipid peroxidation product , along alter glutathione redox state . However , molecular mechanism regulate CNI-induced generation ROS remain unclear . Originally name gp91phox , Nox2 classical phagocytic NADPH oxidase , enzyme naturally involve immune response include `` oxidative burst '' . Nox2 also original identify example system generate ROS primary function enzyme byproduct like mitochondrion peroxisomes . It one seven currently know Nox isoforms , constitutively associate transmembrane stabilize protein p22phox require recruitment cytosolic component p47phox , p67phox , p40phox function . In summary , CNIs , backbone anti-rejection therapy also profibrotic molecule , make difficult effectively manage immunosuppression long-term outcome . We outline research study rigorously assess role Nox2 CNI-induced renal fibrosis . In addition , propose contemporary complementary clinical translational strategy examine molecular mechanism regulate Nox2 activity CNI-mediated fibrogenesis . If successful , result study provide significant step forward design new diagnostic , monitor treatment option aim offset deleterious effect immunosuppressant therapy improve long-term kidney outcome organ transplantation .</detailed_description>
