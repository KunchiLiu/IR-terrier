	<brief_title>TS Stratified Chemotherapy VEGF Inhibition Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Stage IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During screening procedure tumour specimen obtain primary biopsy , analyse EGFRmut immunohistochemically thymidylate synthetase ( TS ) expression . Employing H-Score cut-off 150 , EGFR-wt patient stratify TS low ( Stratum A ) TS high ( Stratum B ) group . This procedure aim provide two equally size stratum . After stratification accord TS expression level patient treat combination Pemetrexed , Cisplatin Bevacizumab . Pemetrexed/Cisplatin/Bevacizumab administer maximum 4 cycle . Patients complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) continue maintenance therapy Pemetrexed Bevacizumab disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Duration treatment/patient : 1,5 year - Follow Up : least 6 month - Planned number patient : 146 treat patient</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirm NonSmallCell lung cancer Tumor stage IV ( UICC 7th Version ) The following histological tumor type eligible : Adenocarcinoma ( include adenocarcinoma bronchioloalveolar differentiation ) Large Cell carcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation Mixed Cell Carcinoma without small cell fraction without predominant squamous cell fraction undifferentiated nonsmallcellcarcinoma No previous chemotherapy stage IV NSCLC Adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy NSCLC must complete least one year prior study enrolment ( end chemotherapy ) No previous treatment Pemetrexed Bevacizumab Patients prior radiation therapy may eligible study meet follow guideline : Previous radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow ( Cristy Eckerman 1987 ) , limited must include whole pelvis radiation . Patients must recover toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment ( except alopecia ) . Prior thoracic radiotherapy must complete 30 day study enrollment . Lesions radiate included site measurable disease unless clear tumor progression document lesion since end radiation therapy . Palliative extrathoracic radiotherapy preexist lesion may continue study ; however , lesion may include site measurable disease .

Examples : oral contraceptive ( sole application oral contraceptive sufficient ) , diaphragm pessary , intrauterine device ( spiral ) , condom plus diaphragm pessary plus spermicide . Histological confirm predominant squamous cell carcinoma Presence activate EGFR mutation exon 1821 Pregnancy lactation period Have know central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , stable , treated brain metastasis . Stable , treated brain metastasis define metastasis evidence progression hemorrhage treatment ongoing requirement dexamethasone , ascertain clinical examination posttreatment brain imaging ( CT scan magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) . Patients corticosteroid 1 week ( 7 day ) time posttreatment brain CT/MRI . Anticonvulsants ( stable dose ) allow . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy , ( stereotactic ) radiosurgery ( Gamma Knife , linear particle accelerator , equivalent ) , combination deem appropriate treating physician , must complete &gt; 8 day prior Day 1 Cycle 1 .
