	<detailed_description>EXCOR® Pediatric intend provide mechanical circulatory support bridge cardiac transplantation pediatric patient . Pediatric candidate severe isolate leave ventricular biventricular dysfunction candidate cardiac transplant require circulatory support may treat use EXCOR® Pediatric . Study Purpose The purpose post-approval study EXCOR® Pediatric VAD evaluate whether safety outcome device use commercial setting comparable safety outcome device use IDE study . Because device extensive use ( available North American site request device compassionate use regulation ) , expect pre-approval post-approval use similar . The primary safety objective EXCOR® Pediatric VAD Post-Approval Study demonstrate serious adverse event ( SAE ) rate subject implant EXCOR® Pediatric study great rate experience IDE study . The primary effectiveness objective EXCOR® Pediatric VAD Post Approval Study assess outcome follow implantation EXCOR® Pediatric transplant eligible child need mechanical circulatory support . Outcome define transplant , recovery leave ventricular function death . The following secondary objective summarize : - Device Malfunction - Site evaluation explanted pump suspect thrombus - Assessment learn curve The study `` all-comers '' prospective study maintain sponsor consist pediatric patient age 0-21 year implant accord IFU EXCOR® Pediatric transplant eligible child need mechanical circulatory support consent enrol study . The study enroll least 39 subject implanted device per device label consent enrol post approval study study commencement implant site IRB approval participation . Study enrollment expect take 10-12 month subject follow reach outcome . The primary endpoint analyze report FDA regular reporting cycle . Explanted subject follow 24 month post explant . A final report submit FDA subject complete 24 month post explant visit . Average time device expect similar average time device IDE study ( 58 day ) therefore last implant expect follow outcome ( IDE range 0 - 435 day ) . The overall study duration expect approximately 36-38 month .</detailed_description>
