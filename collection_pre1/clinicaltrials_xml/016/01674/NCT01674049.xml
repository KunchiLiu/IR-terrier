	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study examine time post-exercise feed 15 hour post-exercise glycemic control metabolic flexibility overweight obese young men family history type 2 diabetes . Aim 1 - To determine temporal effect post-exercise feeding ( i.e. , immediate post-exercise vs. 3 hour post-exercise ) glycemic control , peripheral insulin sensitivity , metabolic flexibility ( evaluated sleep RQ ) group participant . We hypothesize 3 hour delay nutrient ingestion promote significantly great improvement glucose tolerance , metabolic flexibility , peripheral insulin sensitivity immediately several hour post-ingestion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study cross-sectional utilizes within-subject design study young men two different nutrient timing protocol , randomly-ordered space least 2 week apart . 1 . Participants screen eligibility via phone email schedule initial visit , order consent study undergo basic baseline evaluation . We rely participant self-report verify absence chronic disease drug use . 2 . After consent study , fast blood glucose , height , weight , air displacement plethysmography ( BodPod® ) conduct Clinical Exercise Physiology Laboratory The George Washington University , Washington , DC . These measure may occur day consent another scheduled time . 3 . After screen , consent , baseline assessment , participant undergo 2 experimental condition , randomly-ordered approximately 2 week apart . If possible , experimental visit schedule shortly consent form sign . 4 . A registered dietitian instruct participant eat standardize ( 35 kcal∙kg body weight-1∙day-1 ) diet comprise 60 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein , 20 % fat 3 day prior experimental session . This instruction administer BodPod® assessment complete . 5 . Participants report USDA Laboratory chamber 7:30 AM experimental session . Height , weight blood pressure heart rate measure , fast blood sample ( 5 cc ) obtain determination basal glucose &amp; insulin concentration . A Hidalgo Ambulatory Monitoring Sensor Array Vest ( Equivital I : Hidalgo Ltd. , Cambridge UK ) wear participant measure calorimeter entire 48 period . This device measure heart rate ( HR ) , heat flux , core body temperature , posture physical activity ( PA ) built-in accelerometer . 6 . Then , sensor portion CGMS place subcutaneously CGMS calibrate whole blood use Accu-Check Advantage ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IL ) glucometer . Participants enter whole room calorimeter ( metabolic chamber ) complete hunger scale . Hunger evaluate 10-20 minute start meal 2 hour resistance exercise bout . On first day , participant eat standard breakfast provide USDA kitchen approximately 7:45-8:00AM . 7 . Gutierrez research assistant take obtain glucometer reading 60 minute meal calibrate CGMS . These evaluation occur 4-6 time course day . 8 . Standardized meal ( lunch 11:00AM dinner 7:00PM ) provide subject USDA . Blood sample ( 5 cc ) collect prior 120 minute breakfast lunch ; prior 30- , 60- , 90- , 120-min follow start even meal determination post-meal response glucose &amp; insulin . A trained phlebotomist least 50 successful IV catheter placement place IV catheter participant 's median antecubital vein even meal facilitate multiple draw meal . 9 . On second day , subject awake calorimeter approximately 7:00 AM fast blood sample ( 5 cc ) obtain determination basal concentration glucose &amp; insulin . 10 . At 7:30 AM , subject eat standardize breakfast consume 8:00 AM . Two hour standardize lunch meal , serve 11:00AM , participant perform one follow resistance exercise nutrient-timing protocol : immediate post-exercise nutrition approximately 2:00 PM 3 hour post exercise nutrition approximately 5:00 PM ) . All participant undergo experimental condition different test session .</detailed_description>
