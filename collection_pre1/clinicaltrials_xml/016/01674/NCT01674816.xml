	<brief_summary>Problem : Currently , system allow precise kinematic assessment knee accurate guide orthopedic surgical action minimally invasive fashion . However , system would prove useful clinical setting improve quality surgical intervention knee . Hypothesis : A novel knee kinematic assessment surgical guidance tool use 3D personalized image minimally invasive bony fixation allow precise kinematic assessment surgical guidance routine clinical setting . Objectives : - Demonstrating capacity system precisely measure 3D knee kinematics - Quantifying reproducibility kinematic measurement - Measuring impact knee surgical procedure knee kinematics - Assessing correlation measure articular kinematics clinical result knee surgery - Integrating novel measure system surgical flow three knee surgical procedure - Quantifying precision reproducibility surgical action guide system - Comparing clinical result surgery guide system perform traditional technique</brief_summary>
