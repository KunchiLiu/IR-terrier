	<brief_summary>This double-blind , randomize study design compare efficacy safety two fixed combination fenofibrate / simvastatin 145/20 mg fenofibrate / simvastatin 145/40 mg tablet vs. match monotherapies subject abnormal fat ( lipid ) blood high risk cardiovascular disease . Fenofibrate treatment lower fat blood . It prescribe patient high level triglyceride ( TG ) . The drug market 80 country since 1975 . Simvastatin also use treatment patient high level cholesterol . These also market worldwide 20 year . It important treat high level fat blood show even mildly elevate level lipid blood lead diseases blood vessel . It show several study clinical practice combination fenofibrate plus simvastatin lead improve effect blood fat , compare treatment simvastatin fenofibrate alone . The main objective study compare efficacy two fixed-combinations ( FC ) -fenofibrate/simvastatin 145/20 mg tablet fenofibrate/simvastatin 145/40 mg tablet reduce TG increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) versus simvastatin 20 mg 40 mg , reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) versus fenofibrate 145 mg .</brief_summary>
