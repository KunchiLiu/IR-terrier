	<brief_summary>The objective 'Exploring potential synergistic effect aerobic exercise cognitive training cognition stroke ' pilot trial investigate combine effect aerobic cognitive training cognition stroke . This lay groundwork large RCT topic . Twenty patient great 6 month post-stroke randomly assign one four follow treatment group : ( ) aerobic training ( AEROBIC group ) , ( ii ) cognitive training ( COGNITIVE group ) , ( iii ) aerobic exercise plus cognitive training ( AEROBIC+COGNITIVE group ) ; ( iv ) non-aerobic range motion ( ROM ) unstructured mental activity ( CONTROL group ) ( group description , please see detailed description ) . We hypothesize combination aerobic exercise cognitive training effective improve cognition stroke either treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise : Body weight support ( BWS ) treadmill exercise moderately high intensity ( 60-70 % heart rate reserve ) use 15-30 % BWS . An additional 6-10 min need warm-up cool-down . Heart rate continuously monitor , blood pressure rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) measure periodically . Cognitive training : Computerized dual n-back training program involve work memory task , difficulty adapts individual participant 's performance . ROM exercise : Non-aerobic passive active movement upper low extremity joint perform subject lie plinth . RPE record every 5 minute ensure intensity remain low . Mental activity : Unstructured mental activity : listening light novel tape , select subject pre-determined list .</detailed_description>
