	<detailed_description>This longitudinal , observational study mid-life woman span one year.There frequent monitoring food consumption , individual activity individual- level factor think influence food consumption activity dietary restraint , subjective stress , sleep quality duration , physiological stress measure allostatic load . Specific aim : 1 . To identify seasonal change % BF mid-life woman . Participant 's percentage body fat fluctuate , high end winter season low end summer season . 2 . To describe predictor seasonal change % BF . There intervention frequent monitoring food consumption , individual activity individual- level factor think influence food consumption activity dietary restraint , subjective stress , sleep quality duration , physiological stress measure allostatic load . The volunteer ask complete 7-day activity energy expenditure monitoring period ( along body composition assessment , questionnaires regard individual factor think affect food consumption activity , blood draw urine collection measure allostatic load ) four season 12-month period ; monitor period come GFHNRC measurement weight , skin carotenoid assessment fruit vegetable intake , provide morning urine sample monthly ( 8 time ) , receive email remind log secure server complete 24-hr recall 3 time month ( 36 time year ) . The ASA-24 administered assess nutritional intake ; Actigraph GT3X+ , Actitrainer , QStarz GPS logger use assess physical activity . Physiological stress assess use allostatic load index .</detailed_description>
