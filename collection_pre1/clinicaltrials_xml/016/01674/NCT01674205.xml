	<detailed_description>Influenza A viruses widely distribute nature exist many different subtypes . Pandemics influenza occur , vaccine development focus subtypes predict represent great pandemic threat human population . This study seek understand host factor affect replication immune response seasonal candidate pandemic LAIVs human develop biomarkers predict viral shed immune response LAIVs . Three vaccine evaluate : license seasonal LAIV , focus H3N2 component ; H9N2 G9/AA ca vaccine , among immunogenic candidate pandemic LAIVs evaluate date ; H2N3 MO 2066/AA ca vaccine , among least immunogenic candidate pandemic LAIVs evaluate date . The seasonal LAIV evaluate outpatient setting , two vaccine evaluate inpatient setting . In set , participant receive placebo vaccine . Study participant assign one four group . Participants seronegative H9N2 G9/AA ca H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca virus randomly assign receive one vaccine ( Group 1 : H9N2 G9/AA ca ; Group 2 : H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca ) placebo ( Group 4 ) remain inpatient isolation facility . Participants seronegative H3 component seasonal LAIV randomly assign receive either seasonal vaccine ( Group 3 ) placebo ( Group 4 ) follow outpatient . All participant remain study 56 day . Participants inpatient arm admit Day -2 , receive study vaccine Day 0 , undergo basic history , physical examination , nasal wash day discharge . On study day , inpatient participant undergo blood collection and/or nasal swab ; screen visit Day -1 Day -2 , participant give urine sample . Participants outpatient arm receive study vaccine Day 0 study visit Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 56 . On Days 1 7 , participant undergo basic history , physical examination , nasal wash. On visit , participant may undergo blood collection and/or nasal swab ; screen visit Day -1 , participant give urine sample . Unused blood nasal wash sample store may use future research study .</detailed_description>

Behavioral cognitive impairment psychiatric disease opinion investigator affect ability subject understand cooperate study protocol Previous enrollment H2 H9 influenza vaccine trial study avian influenza vaccine For inpatient arm , seropositive H2N3 influenza A virus H9N2 influenza A virus ( serum HAI titer &gt; 1:8 ) . For outpatient arm , seropositive H3N2 component seasonal LAIV ( serum hemagglutination inhibition [ HAI ] titer great 1:8 ) .
