	<detailed_description>Synchrotron radiation ( SR ) use produce monochromatic X-ray photon high intensity tunable energy range medium energy ( 0-150 keV ) . Thus free low energy , penetration still important type possible interaction , addition Compton Effect water , photoelectric effect atom much heavy live mater represent carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen phosphorus . Photoelectric interaction cause energy deposit much large Compton Effect , require presence foreign atom live tissue occur . It may , example iodine , platinum gadolinium , atom commonly introduce human body medical practice contrast medium radiology , anti-neoplastic chemotherapy . The use SR radiotherapy , want take advantage original property , need use combine treatment : radiation plus medication bring heavy atom suitable photo electric effect . Such concept combine therapy widely use radiotherapy decade source many advance treatment , presently routine practice ( chemo-radiotherapy , photodynamic therapy ) still study translational research ( boron neutron capture therapy ) . The SR photon `` photoelectric '' energy band cause highly cytotoxic damage tumor especially treat platinum ( cisplatin carboplatin ) . Indeed , provide photoelectric activation platinum atom lead massive energy deposition DNA tumor . This therapeutic principle call platinum photoactivation therapy ( PAT-plat ) . It particularly suitable tumor small medium volume , localize small medium-depth suitable multi-beam ballistics . Also possibility load tumor tissue high dos heavy compound achieve combine treatment favorable condition , one would expect great therapeutic effect conventional treatment . Brain tumor represent model feature , thanks recent technique convection enhance delivery ( CED ) , allow direct infusion medication tumor . This work conceptually particularly complex although technically sensitive original since ESRF Grenoble University Hospital institution make effort date develop close cooperation SR line entirely devote biomedical research . There site world situation , center either low energy , immediate vicinity academic medical center set collaboration need new already reach experimental level . On hand , technical material investment rather important information flow free , consider appropriate time start research simultaneously several site . The ESRF RSRM team ( `` Rayonnement Synchrotron et Recherche Médicale '' ) therefore pioneer field work well know worldwide . The 2010 Equipex call tender agree fund first table top synchrotron prototype design assembled Orsay : ThomX project LAL , laboratoire de l'accélérateur linéaire , team associate development . Our technique might spread outside domain great instrument [ http : //sera.lal.in2p3.fr/thomx/ ] .. To carry treatment satisfactory distribution dose SR , necessary increase stop power target tumor use injection iodinate contrast medium time irradiation . This treatment applied tumor good contrast uptake CTscan incidentally may treat platinum . For reason , anatomical location intracranial human tumor choose study application treatment SR monochromatic 80 keV . The experimental treatment part standard treatment brain metastasis conformal radiotherapy stereotactic . This irradiation complement pan-encephalic standard irradiation make later , thus provide additional security term dosimetry . Main objective : To prove safety acceptability treatment SR medium-term medical follow-up patient . Primary outcome : limiting adverse event judge accord international scale appropriate post-irradiation `` acute '' toxicity : radiation therapy / chemo-radiotherapy NCI-CTC scale ; post- irradiation `` late '' toxicity radiation therapy / chemo-radiotherapy SOMA-LENT scale . The acceptable limit two criterion grade &lt; 3 ; performance status ( WHO scale ) . Secondary objective : Evaluate limit adverse event free survival ( EIL ) `` severe '' `` late '' , related treatment . ; evaluate disease-free survival treat site ; evaluate intracranial disease-free survival ( absence new metastasis ) ; evaluate antitumor efficacy assess morphological objective response ( complete response partial response ) treatment RECIST . The objective study demonstrate ability deliver reliable , secure efficient radiation synchrotron radiation dosimetry condition similar technique advance radiation therapy high-energy photon . It thus `` platform '' future experimental test new concept combine treatment situ administration vector molecules heavy atom CED . This study without control group evaluate patient 's response accord RECIST criterion record limit adverse event ( EIL ) , acute late , independent external evaluation . Patients initial phase radiation ESRF follow additional irradiation University Hospital . The study carry several successive step , include number patient need achieve propose objective . The number patient three increment , unless extend particular level toxicity . Assuming uneventful progression entire protocol describe , total 50 patient include study two three year . These step : - Verification reproducibility kinetics iodinate contrast tumor . - Introduction iodinate contrast agent IV single-dose irradiation SR. - Dose escalation ( Iodine SR ) fractionation . - Introduction platinum-injection system ultimate optimize RS protocol . - Optimizing dose platinum advance method administration ( CED double platinum protocol ) . The transition one step next dependent feasibility previous step , frequency severity side effect occur step protocol . An External Review Committee monitor progress study propose appropriate change discontinuation trial appropriate . The ESRF CHU Grenoble settle cooperation agreement since building ESRF 80ties develop medical application SR : `` RSRM '' . In 2003 scientific team CHU University Joseph Fourier Grenoble become INSERM unit devote RSRM experimental medical imaging radiotherapy SR main goal : different research axis Unit organize contribute two domain specific department CHU associate . For experimental medical imaging : neuro-radiology cardiology department ; experimental radiotherapy : radiation oncology department CHU . That one tidily associate : patient select , recruit , hospitalize , image treated responsibility MD medical physicist CHU department patient transport irradiation experimental irradiation room ESRF part irradiation plan . This way , first attempt SR application cancer treatment completely embed scientific technical development SR ESRF invest large amount money since year modify , upgrade equip biomedical facility . This pioneer activity follow industrial development know make possible future use SR issue significant valuable progress . This effort , far , give way ThomX project .</detailed_description>
