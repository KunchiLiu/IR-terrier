	<brief_summary>This study single dose evaluation use open label dose escalate design . Cohort1 consist 3 healthy male volunteer . Each volunteer receive slow IV infusion 6 hour consist saline 30 minute ( run period ) , 8 mcg/h GW328267X 1.5 hour ( total dose 12mcg ) 10 mcg/h GW328267X 4 hour ( total dose 40 mcg ) . Subjects continuous cardiac monitoring throughout dose period 2 hour cessation intravenous infusion . PK measurement measurement erythropoietin platelet activation also do . Samples PK take 30 minute interval infusion GW328267X include 1 hour cessation intravenous infusion . Samples erythropoietin platelet aggregation do . Cohort 2 optional may carry event dose GW328267X give Cohort 1 well tolerated subject meet stop criterion . The decision proceed Cohort 2 dose level make GSK Study Team Investigator base safety , tolerability preliminary PK/PD data obtain Cohort 1 . It plan maximum total dose give subject exceed 150mcg . Cohort 2 consist 3 healthy male volunteer study procedure additional Cohort describe Cohort 1 .</brief_summary>
