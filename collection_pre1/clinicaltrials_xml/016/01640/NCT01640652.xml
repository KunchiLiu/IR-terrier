	<brief_summary>In study investigator test new vaccine Neisseria meningitidis , lead infective cause childhood death UK . This bug ( also know meningococcus ) infect line brain ( meningitis ) blood stream ( septicaemia ) affect age , especially child , adolescent young adult . The bug classify different group base outer capsule ( shell ) , study test new vaccine protect group B meningococcus ( MenB ) disease , common type UK . Vaccines give prepare immune system fight infection . Vaccines work stimulate immune system produce specialise protein ( call antibody ) white blood cell design kill bug later life need . Vaccines type meningococcus develop save many life . However MenB different outer capsule stimulate immune system effectively . There therefore broadly effective vaccine MenB disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MenPF-1 - A New Vaccine Against Meningococcal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine investigator test study know MenPF-1 , use two bacterial protein call PorA FetA . PorA work move particle across bacterial cell wall , FetA need bind iron bacteria need order grow . These protein find almost meningococcal bug excellent target immune system , thought could key develop new vaccine MenB disease . MenPF-1 type vaccine know Outer Membrane Vesicle ( OMV ) vaccine . This mean produce 'blebs ' meningococcal bug 's outer membrane , release meningococcus natural infection laboratory . These out membrane vesicle contain PorA FetA protein , use make vaccine . The technique use produce OMVs make MenPF-1 use similar safe effective vaccine . The MenB strain investigator use naturally produce PorA protein , genetically modify produce increase amount FetA OMV vaccine . MenPF-1 contains : - Many protein , especially PorA FetA - Aluminium , safe commonly use many vaccine well activate immune system - Sugar water injection It worth note vaccine product MenPF-1 design work MenB , even successful , would protect form meningitis . Also , live vaccine therefore cause meningitis infection .</detailed_description>
