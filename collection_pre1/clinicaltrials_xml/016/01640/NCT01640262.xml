	<brief_title>Evaluation Modern MRI Diagnosis Prostate Cancer Danish Setup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer ( PCa ) frequently diagnose male malignant disease Denmark 4000 new case year . PCa second lead cause cancer relate mortality western world . During lifetime , one six men clinically diagnosed Prostate cancer approximately one thirty die disease . We know autopsy half male-population age 60 find histological cancer-changes . Therefore , majority men histological proven cancer-changes never develop clinical disease would affect morbidity mortality . An elevated PSA ( blood sample ) and/or abnormal rectal examination indication PCa . The diagnosis make trans-rectal-ultrasound guided biopsy ( TRUS-biopsies ) follow histological examination . Each biopsy-session include 10 12 biopsy-cores take standard location throughout prostate . Since 40 % cancer isoechoic ultrasound see , high risk tumour either miss aggressive part tumour biopsied . If find prostate cancer , important know cancer localize within prostate grows outside capsule . This call stag essential determine best treatment-strategy patient 's prognosis . In Denmark , stag determine digital rectal examination sometimes TRUS , even though know examination inaccurate limitation . It important improve diagnostic localization stag tumour optimal clinical management therapy selection . The development modern multiparametric-high-field-magnetic-imaging ( mMRI ) offer new possibility approach detection , localization stag prostate cancer due high resolution soft-tissue contrast . mMRI provide information morphological , metabolic cellular change characterize tissue- tumour- vascularity correlate tumour aggressiveness . This help locate stage possible tumour guide targeted-biopsies towards disease-suspicious area . Internationally publish data support rapidly grow use multiparametric MRI , sensitive specific image tool prostate cancer patient . The primary objective project investigate whether use modern MRI Denmark : - Improve diagnosis Danish men suspect prostate cancer - Improve diagnosis treatment plan Danish men biopsy-proven prostate cancer . The secondary goal gain experience use modern MRI Denmark evaluate prostatic tumor . This study form basis investigate whether modern MRI use adjunct diagnostic tool select patient diagnosis prostate cancer . The project contain three separate study evaluate adjunct diagnostic value mMRI conventional standard diagnostic evaluation treatment . The three study : - Study 1 offer patient newly diagnose localize non-metastatic prostate cancer compare mMRI TRUS DRE clinical classification cancer . - Study 2 offer patient newly diagnose localize non-metastatic prostate cancer underwent Brachytherapy compare mMRI CT-scan perform 4 week surgery evaluation postoperative dosimetry ( treatment effect ) . - Study 3 offer patient schedule re-biopsy due continue suspicion prostate cancer standard TRUS-guided biopsy negative finding see multiparametric MRI detect prostate cancer invisible transrectal ultrasound ; order improve detection rate .</detailed_description>
