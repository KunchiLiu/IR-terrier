	<brief_title>Enhancing Ugandan HIV-Affected Child Development With Caregiver Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Children age 5 year affect HIV vulnerable subgroup HIV population globally , especially low-resource area . This strategic , volatile , vulnerable nature highly sensitive period child development . Mediational intervention sensitize caregiver ( MISC ) structure train program enable caregiver improve child 's cognitive social development everyday casual interaction home . In preliminary NIMH R34 finding , Ugandan HIV child caregiver receive MISC training biweekly year show significantly great gain Mullen Early Learning Scales Composite g fluid intelligence , compare child whose caregiver receive standard health/nutrition education intervention ( treatment usual TAU ) . The MISC caregiver also significantly less depressed , child mortality year significantly low . Intervention Method . One hundred Ugandan HIV-positive preschool 200 HIV orphan caregiver/child dyad enlist Kayunga Pallisa Districts . These dyad randomly assign village cluster either biweekly MISC health/nutrition education TAU intervention one year . Child Outcomes child development gain Mullen , Early Childhood Vigilance Test ( ECVT ) attention , Color-Object Association Test ( COAT ) memory , Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Functioning - Preschool ( BRIEF-P ) , caregiver administer version Achenbach CBCL . Caregiver Outcomes include array emotional wellbeing ( EWB ) daily function measure validate initial qualitative study phase . Study Aim 1 evaluate MISC significantly enhance child outcome compare control HIV-positive orphan child assess baseline 6 , 12 , 18 month . Study Aim 2 evaluate MISC significantly enhance caregiver EWB daily function outcome . To good understand mechanisms MISC-enhanced child development , Secondary Aim evaluate mediate effect improve caregiver EWB outcomes correspond child development gain , modify effect caregiver HIV illness function child outcome . The Overall Impact come establish feasibility , acceptability , effectiveness MISC HIV orphan vulnerable child ( OVC ) caregiver low resource setting ; sustainability MISC low resource setting since dependent publish material outside resource ; complementary dual impact significant psychotherapeutic benefit caregiver , especially mother struggle HIV disease . MISC also reduce HIV child mortality initial R34 finding , MISC heighten maternal bonding , sensitivity serious illness , prompter seek medical care . It also improve treatment adherence . Finally , evidence-based MISC caregiver training intervention readily</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Child age 1 5 year age . If one child household qualifies , include . HIVinfected HIVaffected child orphan ( loss one biological parent HIV ) . In either case , child must bear confirm HIVpositive mother . Principal caregiver eligible study child able willing participate regular treatment program . The minimum agreed participation requirement biweekly entire year alternate home office , include regular visit 6month interval study clinic complete lab developmental assessment study child . Child illness injurybased CNS insult likely overshadow neurocognitive benefit sensitiveperiod caregiver intervention . Medical history serious birth complication , severe malnutrition , bacterial meningitis , encephalitis , cerebral malaria , know brain injury disorder require hospitalization continue evidence seizure neurological disability . Current enrollment plan enrollment P1 ( 1st grade ) level school first 8 month yearlong intervention period . Having study child school day precludes necessary caregiver access child adequate opportunity implement MISC training child . We expect criterion problematic give age 6 generally age P1 . Primary caregiver respond MISC TAU intervention mental illness disability .</criteria>
