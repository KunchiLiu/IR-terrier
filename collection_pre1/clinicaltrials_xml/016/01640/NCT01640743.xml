	<detailed_description>Immune response mediate interaction antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) , CD4+ helper T cell ( Th ) regulatory T cell ( Treg ) , subpopulation CD4+ T cell intensively express IL-2 receptor ( CD25 ) FoxP3 transcription factor . Treg cell contribute maintain tolerance suppress immune response normal tumour self-antigens . Treg cell originate thymus ontogenesis represent approximately 10 % peripheral CD4+ cell . All effector T lymphocytes generate thymus early stage life evolve production new T lymphocytes well antigen-induced expansion virgin ( naive ) peripheral T lymphocytes convert `` memory '' T lymphocytes lie peripheral lymphoid organ ( 17 ) . Mature T lymphocytes constitute 70-80 % normal peripheral blood lymphocyte , 30-40 % lymph node cell 20-30 % splenic lymphoid cell . T lymphocytes primary effector cell-mediated immunity differentiate subpopulation CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes able lyse foreign cell virus infect host-cells subpopulation CD4+ T lymphocytes regulate activity T B lymphocytes monocyte , production cytokine cell-to-cell contact . Treg lymphocytes play central role among CD4+ cell balance tolerance immunity , responsible maintain peripheral tolerance control self-reactive T cell escape thymic deletion ( 19 ) . Studies fact demonstrate whether one side defect development activity lead serious autoimmune disease , excessive immunosuppression mediate cell stimulates , side , immunodeficient condition also towards antigen produce neoplastic cell favour , consequence , tumour growth . Treg lymphocytes represent approximately 10 % CD4+ T cell present thymus , peripheral blood lymphoid tissue ; consist various population differ term particular cell-surface molecule expression production diverse cytokine , share common scarce response antigenic stimulation immunosuppressive activity . The best characterized Treg lymphocytes call `` natural occur Tregs '' ( nTregs ) , sub-group CD4+ T cell originate develops thymus T-cellular maturation process afterwards normally present peripheral blood function control self-antigens prevent autoimmune disease . These lymphocyte characterize constitutive expression CD-25 ( interleukin-2 receptor α chain ) , Foxp3 transcription factor ( specific cell implied development control within thymus ) , CTLA-4 , GITR LAG-3 surface molecule well TGF-β cytokine , present great quantity cellular surface fundamental functioning . So call `` induce Tregs '' ( iTregs ) build Treg lymphocytes category : CD4+ T lymphocytes lack intrinsic regulatory potential acquire suppressive activity thanks specific cytokine-mediated activation ( 26 ) . They produce periphery allow development peripheral tolerance self-antigens , scarcely express thymus . iTregs consist two different lymphocytic subpopulation : Tr1 , present intestinal mucosa characterize high production IL-10 TGF-β Foxp3 negative ; T helper 3 ( Th3 ) , derive induction native CD4+ T cell due ingestion alimentary antigen , responsible oral tolerance . Th3 Foxp3 positive release high level TGF-β ( 27 ) . While iTregs seem function production immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 TGF-β , nTregs exert activity also various mechanism , cytokine-dependent , cell contact-dependent , accord nature intensity inflammatory response target tissue latter direct . This context-dependent regulatory mechanism lead elaboration model adaptability diversification within function cell : word , Tregs would constitute functionally homogeneous cellular subgroup every single cell exert different mechanism accord characteristic inflammatory response . Some author believe instead Tregs consist several subpopulation , present inhibitory mechanism ( 27-28 ) . Phenotypic characterization Tregs among circulate human lymphocyte complicate fact CD25 exclusively express Tregs also non-regulatory lymphocyte activation , present CD4+ cell express high CD25 level ( CD4+CD25+bright ) consider authentic Tregs . In 2003 Forkhead Transcription Factor ( Foxp3 ) identify major regulator Tregs development ; expression predominantly restrict CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes Foxp3 expression naive T cell support conversion regulatory T phenotype functionally similar nTregs . Foxp3 therefore consider extremely specific marker Treg cell fundamental control development und function . Particularly , study demonstrate lack Foxp3 birth human rat lead massive T-cellular hyperproliferation , result multi-organ autoimmunity premature death ( 24 ) , whereas deletion adult rat cause hyperproliferation expansion dendritic cell well death within two week . Based result Foxp3 seem ideal marker tolerance study . Tregs production strictly control signal emanate various type cell , epithelial cell , T lymphocytes APCs . Although presence latter fundamental TCR-mediated activation Tregs , real suppressive phase vitro induce nTregs actually APC-independent . It imply fact mechanism contact CD4+CD25- effector T lymphocytes CD4+CD25+ nTregs . At present dispose little knowledge regard functional consequence suppression carry Tregs CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes sensitive , beside inhibit IL-2 transcription , consequently , induce cell cycle interruption . Further immune suppression mechanism report study , yet confirm , follow : anergy induction responsive T cell , refractory reaction mitogenic effect IL-2 , release new iTregs likely suppress Th1s Th2s produce TGFβ1 and/or IL-10 . NTregs require particular cytokine development homeostasis . Moreover , Tregs result hypoproliferative anergic TCR activation , probably due incapability transcribe actively secrete IL-2 . This cytokine principally release activate T lymphocytes nTregs exerts biologic activity bind receptor , membrane protein complex form three subunit : α ( CD25 ) , β γ chain . When IL-2 bind receptor T cell activate Janus kinase ( JAKs ) consequently phosphorylate release STAT5 proteins ( signal transducer transcription activator ) . IL-2 exerts fact effect T cell regulate several target gene primarily transcriptional level ; increase expression IL-2R α β chain also modulate expression gene involve cell cycle regulation , induce instance up-regulation proto-oncogenes c-myc , c-fos c-jun , well anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 pro-apoptotic gene like Fas ligand . IL-2 essential nTreg development maintenance , study demonstrate : induced IL-2 depletion rat cause autoimmune disease associate reduced number Foxp3+ nTreg lymphocytes peripheral compartment . Another important cytokine function Tregs TGF-β . Despite inhibitory effect T cell , growth factor likely support extra-thymic production Treg cell increase Foxp3 expression : action , however , necessary exclusively initial induction . TGF-β play therefore different complementary role IL-2 . Finally , critical cytokine function Tr1 lymphocytes IL-10 . Chronic activation vitro CD4+ lymphocytes presence IL-10 lead differentiation Tr1 , high level IL-10 TGF-β , low level IL-2 IL-4 scarce proliferation restimulation . IL-10 moreover induce immunosuppression support formation anergic T cell capable inhibit activity activate T lymphocytes contact-dependent mechanism , compete latter specific APC ( Antigen Presenting Cells ) receptor locally produce IL-2 . These anergic T cell able suppress immune response vivo , transfer rat underwent allogeneic skin graft show longer transplant survival . Beside mention cytokine , others seem involve different way Treg generation induction , IL-4 IL-13 , whereas cytokine antagonist effect , IL-6 instance , contrast immunosuppressive activity without interfere proliferation . Other study Treg function also show transfusion allogeneic Treg lymphocytes subsequent skin graft IL2Rβ-/- rat ( rapidly prone lethal autoimmune disease treat ) control suppressed disease although Tregs self-reactive T cell MHC-incompatible , also consequently allow establish state tolerance transplant present common MHC molecule donor Tregs . This experiment prove Tregs suppress also self-reactive T cell derive non MHC-correlated donor , theoretically , donor pool Treg-based immune therapy would potentially wide . Thanks essential role immune tolerance immunosuppressive function , Treg lymphocytes therefore gaining importance transplantology , experimental model organ transplant underlined capability modulate CD4+ CD8+ cell activity , responsible rejection , inhibiting , suppress GVHD ( Graft-versus-host disease ) , mediate way allotransplant tolerance . There , however , controversial result regard Treg phenotype action mechanism , depend experimental model protocol use induce tolerance .</detailed_description>
