	<detailed_description>In camp displaced person locate along Thai-Myanmar border , mefloquine artesunate combination therapy use since 1992 . It study first trial , 1994 become first line treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria episodes non-pregnant population . In vivo efficacy 3 day regimen mefloquine+ artesunate ( MAS3 ) monitor regularly since introduction 1992 . In 2009 Carrara et al summarise vivo PCR-adjusted cure rate Day 42 Day 63 patient treat MAS3 1995 2005 , well in-vitro parasite susceptibility MAS3 period , change pfmdr1 copy numbers.The proportion patient parasitaemia persist day-2 increase significantly 4.5 % 2001 21.9 % 2002 ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .

Evidence reduce susceptibility artemisinins Western Cambodia first report January 2007 . Artemisinin resistance manifest mark slow parasite clearance . In Pailin , Cambodia , median parasite clearance time 84 hour compare 48 hour Thai side international border Myanmar follow either 2 mg/kg artesunate ( AS ) alone 7 day 4 mg/kg AS 3 day plus 25 mg/kg mefloquine location . A recent analysis parasite clearance data collect prospectively patient uncomplicated hyperparasitaemic malaria show progressive decline parasite clearance rate last decade suggest decline follow trajectory Western Cambodia time lag year . Clinic experience data collect 2011 show steady decline efficacy MAS3 , albeit small number patient . We observe trend past 10 year . It appear relate increased copy gene Pfmdr1 adult male . The PCR correct efficacy 43 patient 47.0 % ( 95 % CI 27.0-64.7 ) , well 90 % threshold WHO recommend change alternative treatment . This decline efficacy mefloquine + artesunate likely attributable reduce parasite susceptibility mefloquine . The fixed dose combination available dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) best option replace mefloquine-artesunate since thought remain effective presence high pfmdr1 copy number . In addition DP administer daily need special dietary modification ensure adequate absorption . However group area document good efficacy MAS3 . In word think decline efficacy feel confident say magnitude drop . Changing policy difficult task need strong evidence current efficacy MAS3 . The best design avoid selection bias adequately power randomize control trial would like compare MAS3 next generation ACT : DP . We already conduct study DP know safe effective . In laboratory study find treatment ( DP ) effective P.falciparum exhibit resistance mefloquine via increase expression Pfmdr1 gene . We think timely compare MAS3 DP carefully monitor treatment response patient sign mefloquine resistant parasite . Therefore , propose study evaluate adequately powered RCT MAS3 ( current national policy Thailand routinely use along border ) potential replacement , DP .</detailed_description>
