	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect laboratory-treated T cell see well work treat patient high-risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) return period improvement ( relapse ) , previously treat donor stem cell transplant . Biological therapy , cellular adoptive immunotherapy , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Placing gene create laboratory person 's T cell may make body build immune response kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety potential toxicity associate treat patient high risk relapse AML , MDS , CML allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) adoptive transfer virus-specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8 T cell genetically-modified express high affinity Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) -specific T cell receptor ( TCR ) . II . Determine anti-leukemic activity associate treat patient relapse AML , MDS CML allogeneic HCT adoptive transfer virus-specific CD8 T cell genetically-modified express high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor ( TCR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine vivo persistence transfer T cell ability migrate accumulate bone marrow . II . Determine maintenance TCR expression function transduce T cell . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients evidence leukemia MDS post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cell intravenously ( IV ) 45 minute ( long patient 15-30 kg ) day 0 14 aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 14-28 . ARM II : Patients evidence leukemia ( AML CML ) MDS ( minimal residual disease overt relapse ) post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cell IV 45 minute ( long patient 15-30 kg ) day 0 14 aldesleukin SC BID day 14-28 . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 4 week , week 6 8 , 3 , 6 , 12 month , annually 15 year .</detailed_description>
