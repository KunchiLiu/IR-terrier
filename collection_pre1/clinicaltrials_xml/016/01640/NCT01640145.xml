	<brief_summary>Maintenance skeletal muscle mass crucial lifespan retain health functional autonomy . Sarcopenia , loss muscle mass age , well-known phenomenon elderly major challenge view individual , socioeconomic point view . Nevertheless , several study prove muscle tissue markedly affect physical activity nutritional intervention even old age . Recently , study young individual show acute bout easily tolerate low intensity exercise prolong muscle building effect milk protein intake compare non-exercised situation . Therefore , major aim present project evaluate , whether low intensity exercise regime conjunction milk protein supplementation induce positive adaptation parameter related muscle size function elderly . The study focus acute muscle protein synthesis response low intensity exercise protein supplementation measure stable isotope tracer technique . It hypothesize light muscle activity augment prolong effect protein feed . If light resistance exercise protocol investigate present project prove beneficial , elderly , frail elderly , individual undergo rehabilitation challenge sarcopenia new tolerable way .</brief_summary>
