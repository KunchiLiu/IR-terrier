	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop evaluate usefulness MRI use inert perfluorinated gas mixed oxygen regional assessment pulmonary function . The propose study seek determine regional qualitative quantitative lung function information context clinical trajectory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) define cross sectional cohort component . In case perfluorinated ( PFx ) /oxygen mixture , availability multi-liter quantity allow wash-in/wash-out image acquisition analysis allow direct measure gas trap manner easily achieve exist modality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently , The Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) announce chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) escalate 3rd lead cause death country . John Walsh ( President , COPD Foundation ) remark `` It 's unacceptable COPD go fourth lead cause third twelve year sooner originally project . This wakeup call intensifies declaration war COPD point importance improve awareness , prevention , detection treatment decrease burden COPD '' . Although significant advance care , COPD epidemic persists , lead approximately 137,082 deaths/yr . US alone . COPD represent disease top ten cause death consistently increase frequency past 4 decade show slight decrease ( ~4 % ) preliminary data death 2009 recently release . The economic burden COPD US 2010 estimate 29.5 billion dollar direct cost ( increase 63 % 2002 ) another 20.5 billion productivity loss . Consequently COPD represent one large uncontrolled disease epidemic U.S. ; currently include 15-20 million diagnosed case perhaps similar number undiagnosed . In U.S. , approximately 90 million current former smoker thus ; huge population risk develop COPD . COPD define Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . There clear recognition COPD include emphysema small airway disease ; however , little appreciation identify COPD early - significant airflow obstruction clinical impairment . It long appreciate good characterization pulmonary disease require assess lung regionally . To end compute tomography ( CT ) gain prominence distinguish airways-predominant vs. emphysema-predominant COPD . CT also add functional information regard perfusion ventilation , concern increase regard radiation dose increase cancer risk . The introduction 3-Helium ( 3He ) MRI enable longitudinal sensitive imaging ventilation , add contrast like apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) reveal emphysema . Unfortunately world supply 3He miniscule , 3He ADC fail measure disease progression . Thus , attention turn 129-Xenon ( 129Xe ) MRI Duke group show clinical 129Xe MRI similar quality 3He , include ADC contrast . Ultimately , however , dissemination hyperpolarization technology require acquire scan remain problematic act hindrance use clinical trial . Consequently another image biomarker require , hence perfluoropropane/oxygen mixture consider . To treat patient , develop new therapy disease , require ability phenotype condition , monitor progression/response , non-invasively longitudinally . Improved measurement critical drive progress treat chronic disease COPD affect 15 million US patient , progress slowly respond therapy slowly . Clinical trial treatment lung airway disease often require large number subject due limited sensitivity global ventilation assessment clinical measure ( e.g . number exacerbation per year ) . The question regional ventilation disorder COPD become increasingly important . An editorial New England Journal Medicine ( NEJM ) address concern use change Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) endpoint treatment trial . The comment relate Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts Function Tiotropium trial ( tiotropium vs. placebo ( UPLIFT ) . In study , report issue , patient use standard respiratory medication ( except inhale anticholinergic drug ) randomize exist treatment either tiotropium placebo follow 4-year period . While treatment group use tiotropium improvement lung function , quality life ( QOL ) few exacerbation 4-year study , significant change rate decline FEV1 either bronchodilator administration . In separate study call Towards Revolution COPD Health ( TORCH ) , trial patient randomized combination treatment ( fluticasone salmeterol ) , agents alone placebo . TORCH patient follow 3-year period primary outcome death cause . The reduction mortality reach statistical validity although benefit secondary outcome ( e.g . frequency exacerbation , spirometric value ) . The difference FEV1 dual agent arm versus placebo 0.092 liter ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.075 - 0.108 , p &lt; 0.001 ) although mean baseline FEV1 treat placebo group 1.24 1.26 liter respectively yield 7 % difference FEV1 , difference generally consider clinically relevant . The dominant question editorial one facing study COPD heterogeneity disorder current lack good diagnostic tool stratification/screening potential subject treatment study . Potentially radiographic non-radiographic imaging may become tool assist screening even serve endpoint . Avoiding failure require develop measurement great sensitivity specificity . Clearly , COPD major health issue country current treatment strategy limit . The limit global pulmonary function test recognize stumble block development evaluation new therapeutic tool disease . These new imaging biomarkers ( PFx 's ) evaluation regional ventilation important step decrease impact diseases US perhaps worldwide . The central hypothesis current observation PFx gas , use contrast agent , provide functional image lung airway include important regional ventilation information ventilation defect severity gas trapping . We test central hypothesis accomplish overall objective addressing follow specific aim : Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1 : Determine quantitative measure lung ventilation performance term direct measure gas trapping measure washout perfluorinated gas mixture . Sub-aim 1.1 : Compare gas trap AIM 1 air trap high-resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) use conventional analysis procedure . Sub-aim 1.2 : We accomplish aim ( well Aim 2 ) well-characterized cohort subject COPD subject normal global pulmonary function test ( non- , ex- current smoker ) . This cohort provide basis cross sectional evaluation image marker aim respect disease severity ( e.g . GOLD status ) risk factor ( e.g . smoking ) Aim 2 : Determine ventilation defect severity compare regional gas signal wash-in perfluorinated gas mixture steady state cohort . The outcomes work propose aim expect demonstrate novel quantitative approach ventilation defect gas trap evaluation regional lung function human would easily deploy multi-center study . It also provide set biomarkers could better inform evaluation new treatment . In 250 subject , obtain informed consent , array clinical , physiologic , image , disease impact data collect dedicated computerized case report form . The goal categorize disease structural , functional , clinical perspective . The specific data collect show multiple study useful describe clinical phenotype help characterize subject . They predict functional status also demonstrate predict responder various therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
