	<brief_summary>It difficulty treatment secondary hyperparathyroidism chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient succeed medical therapy could get parathyroidectomy . The investigator suppose ultrasonic ablation may valuable alternative treatment help control secondary hyperparathyroidism CKD patient present enlarged parathyroid gland ( ) visible ultrasonography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ultrasonic Ablation Treat Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( sHPT ) common patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , include undergoing long-term dialysis treatment . sHPT damage bone system , blood system , cardiovascular system , . The treatment sHPT CKD 's patient include dietary phosphate restriction , use medicine , parathyroidectomy . In mainland China , certain useful medicine treat sHPT , include derivative vitamin D , calcimimetic agent , non calcium aluminum phosphate binder . Furthermore , medical therapy always successful achieve adequate control sHPT . Oral medication efficacy limitation well side-effects . Otherwise , surgery treatment use patient enlarge parathyroid gland ( ) . The patient may suffer injury operation , hypoparathyroidism , recurrence hyperparathyroidism parathyroidectomy . Then ultrasonic ablation may become valuable alternative treatment help control sHPT select patient present enlarged parathyroid gland ( ) visible ultrasonography , .</detailed_description>
