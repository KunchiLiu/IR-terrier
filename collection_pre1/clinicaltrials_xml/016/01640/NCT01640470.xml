	<brief_summary>Many individual mobility limitation , especially old severe impairment , use combination assistive device personal assistance meet need . Assistive technology ( AT ) , include device wheelchair , walker , bathroom grab bar , dress aid , help facilitate day-to-day activity social participation ( basic instrumental activity daily live ) among individual may decrease dependence human assistance . Although research report beneficial outcome AT use , study use control experimental design . Furthermore , result often difficult interpret AT intervention vaguely describe . Another concern many individual receive help others , scant attention pay impact AT caregiver . This neglect produce incomplete portrayal effect AT intervention . The propose study address deficiency evaluate effect formalize dyadic AT intervention individual mobility limitation caregiver . The Assistive Technology Provision , Updating Training ( ATPUT ) intervention involve detailed in-home assessment participant ' current AT ; negotiation implementation personal AT plan participants caregiver ; provision AT device , non-structural home modification , device training . Objectives : 1 . To determine efficacy Assistive Technology Provision , Updating Training intervention assistance user caregiver . 2 . To explore intervention experience individual help explain study finding . General Hypotheses : The investigator anticipate intervention increase daily activity social participation individual mobility limitation ; decrease psychological physical demand caregiver ; reduce amount caregiving require . Methodologies : This research use combination quantitative qualitative method . The quantitative portion experimental , single-blinded study investigator randomly assign participant either ATPUT customary care group .</brief_summary>
