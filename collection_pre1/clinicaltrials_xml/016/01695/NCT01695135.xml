	<brief_title>A Study Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Failed Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment group assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know treatment patient receives ) placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study randomization allocation ratio 2:1 abiraterone acetate group ( abiraterone acetate plus prednisone ) placebo group ( placebo plus prednisone ) . Approximately 200 ( 133 abiraterone acetate group 67 placebo group ) medically surgically castrate male patient mCRPC fail docetaxel-based chemotherapy enrol study 27 month . The study protocol include follow phase : screening ( within 28 day prior randomization Cycle 1 Day 1 ) , double-blind treatment ( 28-day cycle protocol-defined disease progression unacceptable toxicity ) , survival follow-up ( Month 60 ) . During follow-up phase , patient disease progression provide open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) extension treatment abiraterone acetate . In event positive study result time final analysis , participant placebo group show progressive disease double-blind treatment Phase study enrol open-label extension treatment abiraterone acetate treatment base participant 's choice treat physician 's endorsement meet criterion subsequent abiraterone acetate . Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg tablet placebo take orally ( mouth ) daily plus prednisone 5 mg tablet orally twice daily . Efficacy safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
