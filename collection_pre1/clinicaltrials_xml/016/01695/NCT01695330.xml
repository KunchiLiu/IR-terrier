	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , multicenter , open label , nonrandomized study patient MM receive treatment SC bortezomib-containing combination regimen contain thalidomide vincristine . The patient require receive prior IV bortezomib contain combination regimen contain thalidomide vincristine differs SC bortezomib-containing one . In time patient receive IV bortezomib-based combination regimen enrollment onto study , patient may receive non-bortezomib-based regimen long treatment contain thalidomide vincristine . This study enroll patient relapse become refractory prior IV-administered bortezomib-containing combination regimen demonstrate progressive disease follow regimen . Patients must receive 4 dos minimum 1.0 mg/m2 bortezomib administer IV 4 week per cycle . Patients must receive least one cycle meeting definition show progressive disease consider eligible . Patients relapse become refractory recent IV bortezomib-containing combination regimen eligible regardless receive regimen , long meet criterion . The study consist screening period , follow eight open label treatment cycle , final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle , follow-up period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : • To establish safety tolerability treatment SC bortezomib contain combination regimen MM patient demonstrate progressive disease prior different IV bortezomib contain combination regimen : - To compare incidence PN IV bortezomib treatment SC bortezomib subsequent anti-MM combination regimen - To compare severity PN IV bortezomib treatment SC bortezomib subsequent combination anti-MM regimen Secondary Objectives : - To compare overall response rate [ combine CR + good partial response ( VGPR ) + PR + MR ] follow treatment SC bortezomib-containing combination regimen MM patient demonstrate progressive disease prior different IV bortezomib contain combination regimen - To compare disease parameter follow treatment SC bortezomib contain combination regimen MM patient demonstrate progressive disease prior different IV bortezomib contain combination regimen follow : - time progression - progression free survival - time first response - duration response - overall survival - To determine incidence severity injection-site reaction SC administration bortezomib</detailed_description>
