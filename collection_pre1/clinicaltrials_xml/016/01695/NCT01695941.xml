	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alisertib bortezomib give together rituximab treat patient mantle cell lymphoma B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma return period improvement ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Alisertib bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving alisertib bortezomib together rituximab may better treatment relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose MLN8237 ( alisertib ) bortezomib combine rituximab patient relapsed/refractory mantle cell B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe rate overall response ( complete response partial response ) patient relapsed/refractory mantle cell B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat combination MLN8237 plus bortezomib rituximab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical significance Aurora A over-expression proliferative index initial tumor biopsy specimens patient relapsed/refractory mantle cell B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat combination MLN8237 plus bortezomib rituximab . II . To evaluate compare pair biopsy specimen pre-treatment day 8 : apoptosis G2/mitotic ( G2M ) arrest expression level cell cycle related protein include : cyclin D1 , tumor protein p53 ( p53 ) , BCL2-like 11 ( apoptosis facilitator ) ( BIM-1 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B ( p27 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( p21 ) , phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 ( noxa ) , B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ) bind component 3 ( puma ) baculoviral inhibitor apoptosis ( IAP ) repeat contain 5 ( survivin ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib bortezomib . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 ; bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ; rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 days* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Note : *After 8 course , treatment rituximab repeat every 3 course ( 12 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
