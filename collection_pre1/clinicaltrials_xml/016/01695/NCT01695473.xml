	<detailed_description>This phase II , prospective , pharmacodynamic study BKM120 high-risk , localized prostate cancer . After informed consent central pathology review core prostate biopsy , eligible patient enrol schedule ultrasound-guided biopsy prostate confirm high-risk disease collect tissue molecular analysis . Two week biopsy , patient begin take 100 mg/day BKM120 . BKM120 give dose level orally daily 14 day prior radical prostatectomy University California , San Francisco . Radical prostatectomy perform day last dose BKM120 day 14 . No drug administer radical prostatectomy . Up 24 patient , 21 evaluable patient , enrol Department Urology Genitourinary Medical Oncology University California , San Francisco pharmacodynamic study . Toxicity assess BKM120 administration , involve clinic visit Day 14 ± 2 ( i.e . surgery ) . Follow-up safety evaluation 90 ± 7 day post-operatively involve toxicity questionnaire , blood test , clinic visit . Toxicity monitor report use NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 guideline . A patient symptom diary distribute patient baseline symptom self-recording BKM120 dose self-administration . In addition , patient identifier card ( wallet-sized ) distribute patient inform consent registration .
