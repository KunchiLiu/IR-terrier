	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study vorinostat surgery treating patient triple-negative breast cancer . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving enzyme inhibitor therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Before Surgery Treating Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibition use suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) ( vorinostat ) induce expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) gene solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat 400 mg daily orally ( PO ) day 1-21 follow surgery within 14 day .</detailed_description>
