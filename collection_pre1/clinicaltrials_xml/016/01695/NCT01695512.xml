	<detailed_description>The major problem manage life threaten invasive fungal infection patient ( pt ) acute leukemia pt allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation lack sensitive specific diagnostic tool identify fungal pathogen reliably early course disease . Because deep neutropenia low platelet count , invasive diagnostic procedure rarely feasible time , therefore bronchoscopy BAL method choice diagnose pulmonary infection , sensitivity culture-based method blood low , especially mould infection . Indirect method , so-called surrogate marker , become increasingly important clinical setting . These serologic marker , mainly galactomannan ( GM ) recently 1 ( 1,3 ) -Î²-D-glucan ( BDG ) , validate clinical trial blood sample , however clinical significance test BAL sample base retrospective data GM report yet BDG . The aim prospective multicentre diagnostic study therefore elucidate sensitivity specificity rate serologic marker combination molecular tool ( Aspergillus specific multifungal PCR base assay ) , serologic marker pathogen-specific , furthermore define species-specific cut-off value BDG BAL sample . Additionally , genomic material Aspergillus fumigatus detect PCR clinical sample , investigate fungal DNA point mutation cyp51A gene mediate resistance common mould-active triazoles novel rapid , sensitive specific , non-culture-based PCR-assays sequence optimize antifungal treatment early possible . This study aim improve early , sensitive specific diagnosis invasive pulmonary fungal infection detect azole resistance pattern , might impact prognosis hematologic patient ; therefore antifungal treatment data clinical outcome record . Clinical sample ( BAL blood ) approximately 100 pt suffer acute leukemia pt allogeneic stem cell transplantation febrile neutropenia lung infiltrates diagnose chest CT scan suggestive fungal infection investigate pt ` informed consent multicentre , prospective trial . Pts undergo standardize diagnostic image microbiological procedure identification underlie infectious pathogen . BAL blood sample test additionally GM , BDG diagnostic nest Aspergillus PCR assay , multifungal DNA-Microarray azole resistance PCR assay . The molecular assay establish group encompass detection Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Aspergillus terreus , Candida albicans , Candida dubliniensis , Candida glabrata , Candida lusitaniae , Candida tropicalis , Fusarium oxysporum , Fusarium solani , Mucor racemosus , Rhizopus microsporus , Scedosporium prolificans , Trichosporon asahii identify three common point mutation confer resistance triazoles like voriconazole posaconazole . Results diagnostic mean include culture finding well patient ` clinical data ( e.g . duration neutropenia , underlie disease outcome include follow-up data concern antifungal treatment mortality attributable fungal infection ) document , pseudonomyzed include data bank . BAL blood aliquot 20 control pt without immunosuppression ( suffer lung disease ) collect test identically . Case definition make accord 2008 EORTC/MSG criterion . The duration study approximately 24 month</detailed_description>
