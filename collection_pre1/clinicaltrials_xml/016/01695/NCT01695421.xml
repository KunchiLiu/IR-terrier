	<detailed_description>Introduction : Chronic Heart Failure ( HF ) patient significant health care burden many country . Patients afflict HF typically maintain stable cardiac function remainder life consequently require continuous medical management intermittent hospital admission . Several investigation demonstrate electrical muscle stimulation ( EMS ) produce positive physiologic psychological adaptation patient HF . However EMS modality evaluate population even test base present recognize gold standard clinical parameter short period treatment . The impact use low frequency ( FES ) medium-frequency current ( MAC BMAC ) EMS VE/VCO2 BNP likewise investigate patient HF . Purposes : The primary aim propose study : Determine effect five week home base EMS modality ( ) Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) , ( b ) medium-frequency alternate current ( MAC ) ( c ) burst-modulated medium-frequency alternate current ( BMAC ) train program VE/VCO2 slope , Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) level , peak VO2 , VO2 Ventilatory Threshold ( VT ) , perceive quality life , muscle force electrical activity subject diagnose HF ( NYHA III IV ) . Examine change previously outline outcome measurement five week cessation EMS ( ( ) FES , ( b ) MAC ( c ) BMAC ) train program . Procedures : We recruit 40 person ( 10 EMS modality 10 control subject ) diagnose HF . A group control subject participate use sham current . The protocol conceptually divide four section follow chronological sequence : ( 1 ) baseline assessment ( body composition bone densitometer X-ray Dual energy X-Ray absortometry - DXA , Resting blood pressure heart rate , complete blood count BNP analysis ) ; Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLWHFQ ) ; A physician-supervised maximal aerobic exercise test use metabolic cart ( Vmax , Viasys , USA ) ( VO2 , VE/VCO2 , VT ) ; isokinetic peak torque ( Biodex System III , Isokinetic Dynamometer , Biodex Medical , Inc. , Shirley , NY ) electrical activity ( Miotec , Brazil ) , ( 2 ) five week EMS training program ( bilateral quadriceps gastrocnemius 5 day week 1 hour muscle group FES , MAC BMAC train program ) , ( 3 ) immediate post-training assessment within 5 day completion EMS train program ( 4 ) final analysis five week cessation EMS train program .</detailed_description>
