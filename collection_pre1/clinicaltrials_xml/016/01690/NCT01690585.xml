	<brief_summary>The upper low gastrointestinal bleeding , related portal hypertension , common disorder elderly . Indeed , 1996 , French study , median age patient hospitalize upper gastrointestinal bleeding 68 . During period study report English median age 71 . If epidemiological data concern low gastrointestinal bleeding rare , average age hospitalize patient varies 63 77 depend study . Due improvement endoscopic haemostatic procedure current resuscitation method , gastrointestinal bleeding prognosis greatly improve , whereas anaemia relate bleeding episode remain frequent complication gastrointestinal bleeding elderly patient . Among elderly patient 65 , prevalence anaemia vary 8 44 % depend criterion use population study . The occurrence bleeding episode either induce anaemia exacerbate pre-existing anaemia . Physicians charge gastrointestinal bleeding often unaware anaemic consequence elderly patient often serious . Various study show anaemia increase morbidity mortality rate elderly . Life expectancy independently significantly low anaemic patient 65 , non-anaemic subject . Anaemia also risk factor occurrence cardiovascular neurological complication , impairment cognitive function increase risk fall . Iron deficiency anaemia induce bleed episode patient 65 hospitalize upper low gastrointestinal bleeding correct rapidly effectively . Currently , cost risk infection cardiovascular-related complication transfusion lead limit red blood cell transfusion goal average 9 g/dL haemoglobin . It also necessary develop alternative massive transfusion . The correction iron deficiency promote erythropoiesis quickly correct anaemia . In clinical practice , effectiveness iron intake oral route limit frequent occurrence significant gastrointestinal side effect limit patient compliance limited absorption necessitate prolonged treatment correct iron deficiency . The black colour stool cause take oral iron supplement also make difficult detect possible recurrence bleed hospitalization . The prescription intravenous iron seem suitable rapid complete correction iron deficiency gastrointestinal bleeding . The main objective study evaluate efficacy intravenous iron correction anaemia , measure haemoglobin week 6 ( W6 ) patient age 65 , gastrointestinal bleeding . Secondary objective assess speed anaemia correction , tolerance intravenous iron supplementation , rate re-hospitalization within 6 month discharge patient quality life . This prospective multicenter randomize study versus placebo . After obtain informed consent , patient age 65 admit upper low gastrointestinal bleeding , successful outcome , related portal hypertension , responsible persistent anaemia ( definition : Hb &lt; 11 g / dL ) hospitalization include study . Patients treat bleed event usual manner centre target transfusion 9 g / dL haemoglobin . The absence external bleeding haematocrit and/or constant haemoglobin level consider end bleeding . Day 1 arbitrarily define day patient leave hospital . The protocol Day - 1 include : obtaining informed consent patient , determination iron ferritin blood level complete blood count . randomization intravenous iron injection , ( Ferinject ) versus Placebo . Intravenous iron injection perform Day 0 . A complete blood count perform week 6 month 6 . Patients review consultation week 6 month 6 obtain related intercurrent event assess quality life . The result study could lead change care old patient hospitalize gastrointestinal bleeding .</brief_summary>
