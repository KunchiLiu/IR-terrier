	<detailed_description>Background Critical care cost estimate 90 billion dollar per year United States , comprise approximately 1 % gross national product.1 Though expenditure enormous , together advance critical care medicine mechanical ventilation technology , produce priceless trend decrease intensive care unit ( ICU ) mortality.1 Of ICU admission , 40 % require mechanical ventilation , often accompany necessary period sedation inactivity.1 Although patient survive ICU stay , become apparent current ICU culture heavy sedation inactivity take toll complete recovery critically ill patient . 1,2 Several study show significant disability one year discharge , well major decline functional status health-related quality life ; half ICU patient unable return work due persistent fatigue , weakness , poor functional status . 4 The primary contributor muscle waste weakness,5 due prolong immobilization brought illness , lengthy bed rest , deep sedation , use paralytic agents.6 It estimate single day inactivity cause muscle strength decrease 1-1.5 % .7 Although 94 % survivor critical illness myoneuropathy demonstrate meaningful clinical recovery muscle strength 9 month hospital stay , still patient whose weakness may persist , result severe prolong functional deficits.14,18 To combat deleterious effect inactivity improve complete recovery , hospital institute program rubric early mobility , wherein sedation reduce patient engage progressive level activity soon physically possible . Early mobilization start passive range motion exercise , progress active range motion , sit , stand , , finally , walk . Early mobility ICU propose crucial instrument muscle preservation protection neuropathy critical illness , thereby decrease long-term morbidity physical debilitation.18 There grow body evidence indicate early mobilization ventilate patient significant positive impact length stay , muscle condition , patient 's overall sense well-being . The use early mobility patient respiratory failure prove safe implementation proper monitor physiologically stable awake patient.2 Hopkins et al . implement early activity program demonstrate decline length ICU stay 3 days.1 Morris et al . implement similar early mobilization program show statistically significant decrease length stay ICU ( 6.9 vs. 5.5 day , P=0.025 ) well hospital ( 14.5 vs. 11.2 day , P=0.006 ) ; addition notable trend towards decrease inpatient cost per patient ( $ 44,302 vs. $ 41,142 , P=0.262 ) .19 Schweikert et al . able demonstrate patient undergo early mobilization great rate return independent functional status hospital discharge ( 59 % vs. 35 % , P=0.02 ) .20 These study demonstrate ability increase mobilization , improve physical function , decrease ICU resource utilization within relatively short period time appropriate change routine clinical practice.12 Unfortunately , exist significant barrier implementation early mobility program . The significant pervasive barrier culturalâ€”the perception critically ill patient tolerate physical activity . This barrier , however , rapidly dissolve mount evidence note . The demonstrated benefit early mobility prompt increase number institution develop early mobility protocol attempt implementation . Once cultural barrier overcome , however , additional barrier appear . Thus , implementation slow spotty . In multisite study , 27 % patient acute lung injury receive form physical therapy ICU , treatment occur 6 % days.22 These barrier involve : 1 ) provide safety guarantee , 2 ) accommodate staff model , 3 ) find right hardware . With regard safety guarantee , exist legitimate fear regard possible harm patient process mobilization , either secondary patient fall , unintentional removal line , feed drainage tube , endotracheal tube . Safe mechanical support need patient , point full body-weight support . The staff model also critical : mobilization one ventilate patient require , addition physical therapist , least three staff member move medical equipment patient walks.11 , 21 Although give day , within 20-bed ICU , two patient might qualify assisted walking , would require four 15-minute period 5-member mobility team per day , logistics assemble team ICU staff often prohibitive . Finally regard find appropriate hardware , management transport medical equipment alongside walk patient easily address roll pole cart . The current standard care walk mechanically ventilate patient consist wheel walker hold onto patient , patient support gait belt hold behind physical therapist , 4-5 staff person attendance guide patient , roll equipment , ready `` pick '' patient fall . As alternative front-wheeled walker , Rifton Gait Trainer introduce clinical practice . This device provide great inherent safety feature via pelvic harness keep patient fall , even legs give walking . In addition , chest piece keep patient tip forward backward , high handhold help patient mobilize easily . The Rifton Gait Trainer address two three list barrier provide inherent safety feature well hardware , may also help decrease number staff require mobilize patient . Purpose The following section describe 10-week pilot study randomize non-blinded controlled clinical trial ass whether use Rifton Gait Trainer improve incidence mobilization critically ill ventilator dependent patient intensive care unit ( ICUs ) improve important patient outcome . The pilot study design assess feasibility logistics study nature ICU ; also provide mean obtain estimate outcome effect size , number repeat measure , time repeat measure , intra-subject intra-unit correlation , use sample size calculation multi-center study . Subjects Approximately forty subject randomize use either RGT FWW , enrollment span period approximately 10 week . Patients deem eligible ambulate base daily mobility score , calculate accord Early Mobility Protocol . Mobility score first determine base level consciousness . The unconscious patient low mobility level , Level 1 . Patients conscious low RASS score ( -2 ) consider Level 2 . Conscious patient consider Level 3 4 . Level 4 patient patient proven master activity outline Level 3 mobility ; , dangle bedside stand pivot chair . Level 4 activity separate Level 3 activity ability walk hallway . Informed consent occur prior randomization . Randomization occur patient ventilator &gt; 2 day mobility score eligible walking . Randomization assign 1:1 ratio either RGT FWW . Patients randomize use web-based system call CREDIT . Data Analysis A future study consider feasible able enroll 60 % eligible patient , record 90 % eligible ambulation day , least 85 % require data field complete design . Analysis base intention-to-treat ; , regardless walker actually use , patient analyze group randomize . The primary outcome measure , many time patient mobilized day , compare device use hierarchical generalize linear model number time patient mobilized day dependent variable , device , unit day interaction device day independent variable , subject random effect model . Most likely , ordinal regression use 0 , 1 , 2 time definition outcome . If occurrence 2 , convert logistic model . If one device well , would expect odds mobilize high level RGT significantly different odds mobilize FWW . We also test interaction device time . Sources</detailed_description>
