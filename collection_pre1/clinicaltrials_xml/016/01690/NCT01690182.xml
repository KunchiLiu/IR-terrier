	<brief_summary>The GI MRI Research group University Nottingham develop new , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques image gastrointestinal tract . In collaboration food manufacturer Unilever , investigator want image abdomen healthy volunteer consumption test meal vary volume energy density determine level gastric distension investigate possible correlation subject ' sense satiety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The tone proximal stomach decrease meal intake process gastric accommodation , aim increase capacity stomach . An increased gastric volume progressively distend stomach , distension show inverse relationship appetite . The link assume base activation mechanoreceptors lie wall stomach . On activation , vagal discharge trigger , lead activation hypothalamic neuron regulation feeling satiety . Gasrtric empty also regulate duodenal feedback mechanism trigger arrival amount nutrient . Based current knowledge , high volume test meal would expect produce gastric distension satiety low volume test meal , low energy density food would expect empty stomach faster high energy density food . Going premise , study test meal 2 would expect empty faster study test meal 1 . These phenomenon investigate use non invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) method . MRI measure gastric volume serially non-invasively high spatial resolution . Ultimately , finding study provide novel insight mechanism gastric distension satiety .</detailed_description>
