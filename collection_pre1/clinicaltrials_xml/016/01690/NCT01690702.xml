	<brief_title>Study Nab-Paclitaxel High Risk Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Norton-Simon-Hypothesis log cell kill suggest chemotherapy give maximum dosage minimum interval . Combination chemotherapy , always make compromise regard dos drug treatment interval due acute well cumulative toxicity , therefore comply theory . Sequential application monotherapies , however , allow high single agent dose dose-dense treatment interval . Regimens design accord Norton-Simon-Hypothesis show highly active adjuvant treatment early breast cancer . As number cycle agent restrict 3 , previously do AGO ETC trial Möbus et al. , cumulative toxicity really occur . Two large scale trial dose-dense chemotherapy proven high protective activity tumor recurrence ( AGO ETC ( Ref.1 ) CALGB 9741 ( Ref.2 ) ) . Especially ETC trial ( epirubicin , solvent-based paclitaxel , cyclophosphamide ) show impressive superior DFS OS 1284 high-risk breast cancer patient &gt; 4positive lymph node . The dos use exceptional maximum dosage minimum interval epirubicin 150 mg/m² , Paclitaxel 225 mg/m² cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m² give every 2 week base described Norton-Simon-Hypothesis . However , drug give 3 time intervals 2 week , regimen feasible safe primary support G-CSF ESF . The ETC schedule today consider standard care high-risk breast cancer patient Germany . However , trial , ETC CALGB 9741 , compare dose-dense concept EC-P q3w nowadays consider inferior regimen compare EC-P weekly EC-Doc . The GAIN trial 2x2 factorial design explore ETC versus EC-TX ibandronate vs. observation . The trial close recruitment 3023 pt July 2008 . In Panther trial , joint effort SBG , ABCSG , AGO-B GBG , tailor , dose-dense EC-Doc ( dtEC-dtD ) regimen test conventional dosed FEC-Doc . Efficacy result await , safety result publish 2012 . Nab-paclitaxel ( nP ) provide good toxicity profile high efficacy compare solvent base taxanes ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) . It might therefore preferred component intense dose-dense regimen . Assuming correspond dose nab-paclitaxel 175 mg/m² paclitaxel 260 mg/m² , appropriate dose would 330 mg/m² nab-paclitaxel substitute paclitaxel 225 mg/m² . So far , experience dose nab-paclitaxel available . However , initial experience 300mg/m² q3w 150mg/m² weekly ( 3 4 week ) show good safety profile even give median 8 cycle ( Ref.3 ) . Another pilot study show good tolerability 260 mg/m² nab-paclitaxel give q2w 4 cycle ( Ref.4+5 ) . The GAIN-2 trial allow compare toxicity effectiveness predefined intense dose-dense regimen ( EnPC ) vs. dose-dense regimen modification single dos depend individual haematological non-haematological toxicity . The primary aim GAIN-2 trial compare invasive disease-free survival adjuvant chemotherapy EnPC dtEC-dtD patient primary node-positive high risk node negative breast cancer . To explore maximum dose nab-paclitaxel setting , run-in phase vary dos nab-paclitaxel include study design .</detailed_description>
