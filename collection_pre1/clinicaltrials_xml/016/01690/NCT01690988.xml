	<brief_summary>Delirium medical term condition include temporary inability focus attention think clearly . Delirium occur commonly ( 10 % 70 % ) patient older 60 undergoing large surgery . The purpose study test rigorously whether drug call ketamine decrease chance patient experience delirium surgery . The investigator also test whether ketamine decrease postoperative pain , postoperative opioid consumption , postoperative nausea vomiting , ICU hospital length stay , adverse outcome ( e.g . hallucination nightmare ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium one common complication major surgery , affect 10 % 70 % elderly surgical patient . Delirium manifest poor attention inability think logically , associate longer intensive care unit hospital stay , long last cognitive deterioration , increase mortality rate . Studies show low sub-anesthetic dose ketamine , anesthetic drug , potential decrease several postoperative complication , include delirium , pain , opioid consumption , nausea vomit . Low dose ketamine would particularly appeal drug prevent delirium postoperative complication , inexpensive extremely safe . However , propose benefit ketamine perioperative setting yet test large clinical trial . The investigator therefore propose pragmatic , exploratory clinical trial support refute contention low dose ketamine decrease incidence postoperative delirium , possibility conduct large randomized clinical trial pending result study . At time enrollment , patient undergo delirium pain evaluation use postoperatively . Additionally patient screen functional dependence use Barthel Index Activities Daily Living , depression use Geriatric Depression Scale - Short Form , obstructive sleep apnea use STOP-Bang criterion . They also ask fall experience six month prior surgery . Comorbid condition , include component Charlson Comorbidity Index , obtain review patient ' medical record . Any available preoperative lab result , include electrolyte blood count , also record . Patients randomize receive low dose ketamine placebo follow induction anesthesia prior surgical incision . Blinded observer assess delirium afternoon/evening postoperative day 0 ( feasible ) twice daily ( morning afternoon/evening least six hour assessment ) postoperative day 1-3 use Confusion Assessment Method Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit . Acute pain assess via observer-based Behavioral Pain Scale Behavioral Pain Scale ( Non-Intubated ) subsequent administration patient-reported Visual Analog Scale postoperative day 0-3 . Postoperative opioid consumption assess patient ' medical chart postoperative day 0-3 . Postoperative nausea vomit assessed via patient-reported section Behavioral Pain Scale Behavioral Pain Scale ( Non-Intubated ) postoperative day 0-3 . ICU and/or hospital length stay assess patient ' medical chart . Adverse outcome ( e.g . hallucination nightmare ) assess via Confusion Assessment Method Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit postoperative day 0-3 .</detailed_description>
