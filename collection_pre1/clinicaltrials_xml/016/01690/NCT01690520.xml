	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well donor umbilical cord blood transplant without ex-vivo expand cord blood progenitor cell work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , chronic myelogenous leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome . Giving chemotherapy total-body irradiation donor umbilical cord blood transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's cell . When healthy stem cell ex-vivo expand cord blood progenitor cell infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . It yet know whether give donor umbilical cord blood transplant plus ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cell effective give donor umbilical cord blood transplant alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant With Without Ex-vivo Expanded Cord Blood Progenitor Cells Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia , Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia , Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia , Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time neutrophil engraftment ( absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] &gt; = 500 ) patient receive standard care myeloablative cord blood transplant ( CBT ) augment off-the-shelf pre-expanded cryopreserved cord blood product receive product . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Provide initial data clinical economic benefit , time platelet engraftment , duration initial hospitalization , transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) , death without engraftment , incidence severe infection first 100 day post-transplant . II . The kinetics immune system recovery also evaluate arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Standard Care Arm : CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day -8 -6 cyclophosphamide IV day -7 -6 . Patients also undergo total-body irradiation ( TBI ) twice daily ( BID ) day -4 -1 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo single-unit double-unit unmanipulated umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) transplant day 0 . GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE ( GVHD ) PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive cyclosporine IV 1 hour BID ( adult ) thrice daily ( TID ) ( child ) orally ( PO ) day -3 100 taper begin day 101 . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) IV TID day 0-7 may receive MMF PO TID . Patients remain MMF TID minimum 30 day , may begin taper evidence GVHD well-engrafted one donor unit . Experimental Arm : CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV cyclophosphamide IV , undergo TBI Standard Care Arm . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo single-unit double-unit unmanipulated UCB transplant day 0 . Patients also receive infusion ex vivo-expanded cord blood progenitor least 4 hour completion UCB transplant . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive cyclosporine IV PO mycophenolate mofetil IV PO Standard Care Arm . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
