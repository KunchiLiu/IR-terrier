	<brief_summary>Study objective : The primary objective determine efficacy BEZ235 Objective Response Rate ( best response study ) accord RECIST 1.1 criterion The secondary objective : - To determine progression free survival rate 32 week include population - To assess duration response among responder - To evaluate time response - To evaluate time progression - To assess overall survival - To evaluate safety tolerability BEZ235 The exploratory objective : - To identify molecular genomic profile PEComas potential relationship clinical outcome analyze PIK3CA , Ras , Raf , TSC , AKT PTEN alteration tumor sample ( archival fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy ) PIK3CA circulate DNA . - To determine biomarkers relevant BEZ235 activity analyze expression phosphoprotein p-AKT , p-S6 , p-4EBP1 screening treatment well biomarkers proliferation ( Ki-67 ) apoptosis ( PARP ) ( fresh tissue ( optional ) available ) . Study population : The patient population consist patient 18 year old old progressive unresectable/advanced metastatic malignant PEComas previously treat unresectable/advanced/metastatic disease 1 2 prior line chemotherapy . Patients must adequate hematologic , renal , cardiac hepatic function previously treat mTOR inhibitor . Number patient : 16 33 patient Overview study design : This prospective , multicenter , open-label , single arm , two-stage phase II study investigate efficacy tolerability BEZ235 patient progressive metastatic unresectable/advanced malignant PEComas . The patient receive 1 2 prior line chemotherapy . BEZ235 administer disease progression . Sixteen patient enrol Stage 1 observe least 32 week time interim analysis perform ( plus eventually 4-5 week confirmation response occur closely cut-off date ) . If number patient response ( CR PR ) 2 less , trial stop futility . If 3 patient experience response enrollment continue 33 patient ( Stage 2 ) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) constitute review interim analysis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion 1 . Histologically confirm diagnosis malignant PEComa ( include epithelioid AML ) primary disease metastatic lesion archival tissue obtain within 12 month prior enrollment study . This histological diagnosis include immunochemistry follow : Immunohistochemically positive expression melanocytic marker ( HMB45 , MelanA microphtalmia transcription factor ) AND smooth muscle marker ( smooth muscle actin , panmuscle actin , hcaldesmon calponin ) mandatory primary metastatic tumor biopsy . Note : According Folpe ( 2002 ) , criteria malignancy nonAML PEComas : tumor size 5 cm , infiltrative growth pattern , high nuclear grade , mitotic activity 1/50 high power field ( HPF ) , necrosis , vascular invasion Thus , include trial , patient tumor present 2 criterion malignancy associate aggressive clinical behavior . 2 . If primary diagnosis perform 12 month enrollment , histology primary/metastatic lesion reconfirm fresh biopsy . 3 . Availability representative tumor specimen , either archival fresh tumor tissue PI3K pathway analysis . 4 . Unresectable/advanced and/or metastatic document progressive measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion . Prior study entry , progression disease confirm least 2 sequential CT scan available documentation ( collect hold ) . 5 . Presence measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 . Note : Lesions previously irradiate area consider measurable clearly progress since radiotherapy . 6 . Treated 1 2 prior line treatment Exclusion criterion 1 . Disease exclusion : 1 . Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) exclusively 2 . Active uncontrolled symptomatic CNS metastasis Note : A patient control asymptomatic CNS metastasis may participate trial . As , patient must complete prior treatment CNS metastases &gt; 28 day ( include radiotherapy and/or surgery ) prior start treatment study receive chronic corticosteroid therapy CNS metastasis . 3 . Concurrent malignancy malignancy last 3 year prior start study treatment ( exception adequately treat cervical carcinoma situ nonmelanoma skin cancer ) .</criteria>
