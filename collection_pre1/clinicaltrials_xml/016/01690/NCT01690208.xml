	<detailed_description>Diabetic patient high risk co-morbidities closely related disease duration coexist cardiovascular risk factor complication . Data show follow 3 group diabetic patient extremely high risk future event : 1 . Obese type 2 diabetic patient : Weight control major therapeutic challenge often require cognitive-psychological-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) addition pharmacological surgical intervention . After long disease duration , often characterize presence complication , many obese diabetic patient need insulin control glycemia put risk weight gain set vicious cycle . 2 .

Furthermore , patient often default follow non-compliant due compete priority lack symptom . These young patient also mark phenotypic heterogeneity characterise insulin insufficiency and/or obesity strong family history . 3 . Diabetic patient establish cardiovascular-renal complication . In series analysis , Chinese type 2 diabetic patient establish cardiovascular kidney disease 38 % event rate include all-cause death cardiovascular-renal complication include peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) 5 year . These 3 group patient difficult treat many unmet need require complex treatment regimen , intensive counsel emotional support . In series study , investigator confirm marked benefit use team approach deliver structure care particular emphasis continuation care periodic reminder clinical outcome . Preliminary analysis peer support program also demonstrate benefit utilize organize visual information communicate personalize risk target , augment peer support , improve risk factor control type 2 diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
