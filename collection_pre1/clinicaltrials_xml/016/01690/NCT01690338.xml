	<brief_title>A Study Residual Curarization Incidence China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last twenty year , residual curarization PACU ( Post Anesthesia Care Unit ) become common problem clinical practice pose high risk patient . The residual curarization incidence Neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) vary much different study . These difference indicate necessity study . In China , common view harmfulness residual curarization complication . The consensus necessity neuromuscular transmission monitoring neuromuscular blockade antagonist reach yet . There also similar large-scale survey China . In case , investigator conduct large scale multicentre study , design learn incidence residual curarization complication . Further analysis risk factor also make . All effort hop fill data gap provide reliable evidence rational use NMBA .</detailed_description>
