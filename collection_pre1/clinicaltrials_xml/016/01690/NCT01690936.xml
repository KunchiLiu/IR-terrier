	<detailed_description>Experiment protocol measurement ) Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) session At baseline , participant attend session standard OGTT drink contain 75 gram dextrose perform follow overnight fast . Serum glucose insulin concentration measure 0 120 minute session . During session , height , weight ( Tanita ) , body fat ( air displacement plethysmography , BOD POD ) , waist circumference , blood pressure measure . Participants also complete 24-hour dietary recall use multi-pass interview method standard questionnaire assess personality , eat behavior habitual physical activity level OGTT session . After completion session , participant ask record hourly appetite sensation , measure `` hunger '' , `` fullness '' `` desire eat '' visual analog scale , wake hour day attend next ( clinical ) visit . Participants repeat session four week almond consumption . ii ) Acute feed session Within week follow OGTT session , participant return acute-feeding session , overnight fast least 10 hour . This session begin 7:00 8:00 , last approximately 515 minute . Upon arrival , indwell arm catheter place upper arm blood sample collection . Participants rest 15 minute catheter placement , baseline blood sample drawn . Immediately first blood sample collection , standard breakfast serve , participant instruct consume entire portion within 10 minute . Subsequent blood sampling perform 15 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute breakfast , standard lunch provide participant . Again , participant give 10 minute consume lunch , blood sample take similar interval ( 265 , 295 , 310 , 340 , 370 , 430 , 490 minute session ) . Participants randomize BF LN group receive 43 gram almonds together meal , MS AS group consume 43 gram almonds 120 minute breakfast lunch respectively . Participants also record `` hunger '' , `` fullness '' , `` desire eat '' sensation blood sample take . During acute-feeding session , activity may alter appetite sensation ( e.g . sleep watch movie contain food cue ) prohibit . Postprandial glucose , insulin triacylglycerol concentration measure 15 sample collect participant . Participants almond group group also ask rate liking almonds ingested use general label magnitude scale , action response almonds use `` food action rating scale '' , visual analog scale range `` I would eat almond I force '' `` I would eat food every opportunity I '' anchor 2 extreme . This session repeat four week almond supplementation . iii ) Weekly follow-up Following baseline acute-feeding session , participant ask consume 43 gram almond every day time base group randomization . The CL group instruct avoid nuts seed diet study period . All almonds dry-roasted lightly salt , pre-weighed per-packaged convenience . Except permission adjust dietary intake due almond supplement , participant ask maintain dietary intake physical activity level . A ruse ( breath analysis ) introduce order enhance compliance participant consume almond designate time day . Compliance almond consumption assess fast plasma Î±-tocopherol . Participants attend weekly visit ( week-1 , 2 3 ) overnight fast , body weight record compliance study protocol reinforce . During week-2 visit , participant also ask complete 24-hour dietary intake assessment use multi-pass interview method appetite sensation rating VAS every wake hour day . On week-4 , participant return OGTT acute-feeding session describe . The study protocol approve Purdue University Institutional Review Board .</detailed_description>
