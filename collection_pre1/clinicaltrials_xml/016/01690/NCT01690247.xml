	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation lifesaving intervention patient end-stage liver disease . The current immunosuppressive agent reduce incidence acute cellular rejection ; however , rate acute rejection reach 20-50 % liver transplantation . Furthermore , long-term side effect regimens become major challenge liver transplant recipient increasingly perceive unmet clinical need , example , increase incidence bacterial , viral infection , nephrotoxicity chronic renal impairment , de novo diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , arterial hypertension , cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , neurotoxicity , hematological toxicity . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) appear effective regulating invoke immune response set tissue injury , transplantation , autoimmunity , use successfully treat graft versus host disease show immune modulation function vitro vivo may help repair damage tissue ( ) . Current clinical trail demonstrate use autologous bone marrow MSC ( BM-MSC ) renal transplant patient result low incidence acute rejection , decrease risk opportunistic infection , well estimate renal function . Compared BM-MSC , umbilical cord derive MSC ( UC-MSC ) may better choice clinical application . One main reason collection BM-MSC liver transplant patient would harmful patient . Moreover , proliferative ability BM-MSC patient liver disease deficient , whereas , UC-MSC obtain discarded umbilical cord produce large scale . Our study report infusion human UC-MSC feasible improve liver function liver fibrosis liver failure . The purpose study learn whether UC-MSC improve condition liver transplant patient . This study also look well UC-MSC tolerate safety liver transplant patient . Participants study randomly assign one two treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive 12 week standard regular immunosuppressive agent plus UC-MSC treatment . Arm B : Participants receive 12 week standard regular immunosuppressive agent plus placebo . UC-MSC prepared accord standard procedure collect plastic bag contain anti coagulant . MSCs give via i.v . sonography monitoring . After UC-MSC transfusion , patient follow week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 , evaluation liver function recovery perform .</detailed_description>
