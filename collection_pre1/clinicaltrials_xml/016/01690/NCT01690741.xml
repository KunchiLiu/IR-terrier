	<brief_summary>This study first test anti-cancer peptide Nerofe human . It evaluate safety , pharmacokinetic behavior , pharmacodynamic clinical effect Nerofe give intravenously every day patient advance malignant disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial Intravenously Administered Nerofe™ Subjects With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 single-center , open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation study , conduct 2 phase . The Dose Escalation Phase determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Nerofe evaluate safety tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , immunogenicity , preliminary clinical effect . The subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase cohort expansion MTD Nerofe . Subjects treat IV dos Nerofe thrice weekly ( alternate day ) consecutive , 28-day cycle . Subjects evaluate regularly safety . Subjects tolerate drug experience progressive disease , intolerable toxicity , meet withdrawal criterion may continue receive Nerofe 6 cycle , discretion Principal Investigator . Throughout trial , oversight provide Clinical Safety Committee .</detailed_description>
