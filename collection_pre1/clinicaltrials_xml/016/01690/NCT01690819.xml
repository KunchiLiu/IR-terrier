Protective ventilatory strategy positively evaluate first patient ARDS , undergo cardiopulmonary bypass lung resection surgery , brain death organ donor , data effect protective mechanical ventilation patient acute brain injury still lack even population recognize risk factor ARDS . Therefore , primary aim multi-center , prospective , randomize , control trial investigate whether protective ventilatory strategy , early phase severe acute brain injury , associate low incidence ARDS , avoid damage brain . Secondary aim evaluate protective ventilatory strategy associate reduced duration mechanical ventilation , incidence organ failure , intensive care unit length stay , low concentration plasma inflammatory cytokine , without adversely affect neurological outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) describe common non-neurologic organ dysfunction occur early phase severe acute brain injury , report incidence 10-15 % increased morbidity mortality . A significant role recently propose neuro-inflammation genesis ARDS follow acute brain injury . The neuro-inflammatory response represent initially coordinate effort protect brain injury , may become altered responsible activation secondary injury cascade lead single multiple organ dysfunction . This preclinical event may increase susceptibility lung stress injurious mechanical ventilation . The main target ventilatory management acute brain injury patient maintenance optimal oxygenation , tight arterial carbon dioxide control . Actual Guidelines management severe traumatic brain injury , particular , state hypoxia ( PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg SaO2 &lt; 90 % ) avoid PaCO2 level tightly control target 35-38 mmHg . However , publish recommendation exists ventilator set , term tidal volume , respiratory rate , positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) level , use obtain respiratory target . In previous study patient ARDS , mechanical ventilation low tidal volume moderate PEEP level result decreased mortality increase number ventilatory free day , represent standard care patient . Patients acute brain injury represent category risk develop ARDS adrenergic cascade inflammatory reaction , ventilatory strategy implement optimize gas exchange . Nevertheless , clinical trial perform evaluate effect protective ventilatory strategy upon severe acute brain injury patient . AIMS The aim study investigate whether application protective ventilatory strategy , define low tidal volume moderate level PEEP , improve combined end point `` event free survival '' define survival without ventilator dependency ARDS diagnosis , without adversely affect neurological outcome . Secondary aim study evaluate protective ventilatory strategy may increase number ventilator organ failure free day , reduce intensive care unit ( ICU ) length stay , reduce incidence ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) , reduce concentration plasma inflammatory cytokine ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha , TNF-RI/II , IL-8 , IL-1ra , IL-1beta ) , without adversely affect neurological outcome measure Modified Oxford Handicap scale intensive care unit discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale-extended ( GOSe ) 6 month .</detailed_description>
