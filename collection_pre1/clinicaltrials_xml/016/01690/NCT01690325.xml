	<brief_summary>The GALADON trial diagnostic interventional study different molecular imaging method Positon Emission Tomography ( PET ) , different kind Magnetic Resonance Imaging - method ( MRI , DWI DCE-MRI ) compare common image method ( mammography , ultrasound ) see detect early response combine neoadjuvant therapy bevacizumab docetaxel patient locally advance breast cancer . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( mean patient treated tumor remove surgery ) drug like trastuzumab ( monoclonal antibody ) target Her2-protein much powerful chemotherapy alone normalize blood supply improve tumor delivery conventional chemotherapy like docetaxel . The HER2 protein available 30 % breast cancer type . bevacizumab another humanize monoclonal antibody like trastuzumab effective patient positive HER2 status combination trastuzumab may emphasize effect reduction tumor growth . Bevacizumab approve advanced disease , major neoadjuvant data available far primary breast cancer . As therapy monoclonal antibody regime expensive may cause severe side effect predictive factor select patient benefit highly specific drug therapy start would medically economically highly valuable . In study efficacy combine neoadjuvant chemotherapy bevacizumab , trastuzumab docetaxel Arm A bevacizumab docetaxel Arm B evaluate predictive impact different image method tumor response show .</brief_summary>
