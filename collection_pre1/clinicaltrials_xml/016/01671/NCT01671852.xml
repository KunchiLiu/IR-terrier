	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) child disorder breathe sleep characterize prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction ( obstructive apnea ) disrupt normal breathe sleep1 . The condition occur 2-5 % child occur age , common child age 2 62,3 . Untreated OSA associate lung disease , heart disease , growth delay , poor learn behavioral problem inattention hyperactivity . The common underlying risk factor development OSA enlargement tonsil adenoid . Given potential risk complication associate surgery tonsil adenoid , medication shrink adenoid without require surgery consider , particular intranasal corticosteroid ( INCSs ) nose spray . A recent Cochrane systematic review suggest short-term benefit INCSs child mild moderate OSA4 . The author recommend randomise controlled study require evaluate efficacy INCSs child OSA . In particular recommended future study employ sleep study look improvement INCSs , include child severe OSA , patient great risk complication surgery would benefit non-surgical treatment . The purpose study therefore explore efficacy INCSs child full spectrum OSA severity , include sleep study analysis. , long term follow-up .</brief_summary>
