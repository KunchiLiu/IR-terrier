	<brief_summary>Depressive disorder occur high rate patient inflammatory disorder , point prevalence 15-29 % , two three time great observed general population . Substantial evidence show inflammation increase proinflammatory cytokine activity play critical role onset perpetuation depression depressive symptom ( e.g . insomnia , fatigue ) co-morbid inflammatory disorder . Consistent , experimental work show inflammatory challenge increase depress mood otherwise healthy sample . Based finding , grow interest whether inflammatory process contribute depression causal manner effect might occur . Given observation inflammatory process trigger social withdrawal , couple evidence feeling 'social disconnection ' play critical role onset perpetuation ( non-inflammatory form ) depression , surprising social psychological consequence inflammation contribution depression fully explore . Here , suggest inflammation may increase feeling social disconnection social psychological change may important contributor inflammation-associated depression . Indeed , preliminary data demonstrate experimentally-induced inflammatory challenge ( endotoxin ) lead increase self-reported feeling social disconnection ( e.g. , `` I feel disconnected others '' ) addition increase depress mood . Aside finding , however , study explore effect inflammatory process social experience human . The over-arching objective proposal explore experiential neural correlate inflammatory-induced change social experience ( e.g. , feeling social disconnection ) , may provide critical miss link understand relationship inflammation depression . Participants ( n=100 ) randomly assign receive either endotoxin placebo monitor next six hour . Blood draw assess cytokine level well self-reported feeling social disconnection depress mood collect hourly . In addition , time peak cytokine response , participant complete neuroimaging session examine effect inflammatory challenge neural sensitivity social rejection social acceptance . It hypothesize endotoxin increase feeling social disconnection time , underlie neural sensitivity give rise feeling ( e.g. , increased neural sensitivity social rejection ; decrease neural sensitivity social acceptance ) contribute inflammatory-induced depressed mood .</brief_summary>
