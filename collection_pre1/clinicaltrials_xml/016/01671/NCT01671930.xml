	<brief_summary>Introduction Cardiovascular disease lead cause death Western world . The main cause cardiovascular event development atherosclerosis coronary artery . In 70 % case , myocardial infarction cause atherosclerotic plaque rupture , result subsequent formation occlude thrombus . Plaques high risk rupture call vulnerable plaque . Cardiovascular image provide complementary diagnostic approach assessment cardiovascular risk patient . However , lack biological detection possibility current image technology limit predictive value . For instance , multi detector compute tomography ( MDCT ) excellent tool visualize coronary atherosclerosis . However , individual risk assessment still problematic . Which diagnose atherosclerotic plaque undergo plaque rupture lead acute vascular event currently hard predict . Potentially , serum biomarkers could help identify patient risk . A wide variety prognostic marker related atherosclerosis identify past predict cardiovascular event . Nevertheless , predictive value individual patient still limit . A difficulty serum biomarker research requirement large patient cohort study relation event rate serum biomarker level . The necessity perform lengthy costly study , hinders translation novel cardiovascular serum biomarkers clinic . An alternative approach could study correlation level serum biomarkers presence atherosclerosis coronary artery . Study objectives Primary objective present analysis investigate predictive value variety serum biomarkers predict atherosclerosis coronary tree patient undergoing cardiac MDCT . Design Methods Patients undergoing cardiac MDCT eligible study . Excluded patient acute coronary syndrome , hemodynamic instability , pregnancy , severe renal insufficiency , allergy contrast medium inability obtain informed consent . Permission store serum sample future analysis new prognostic marker cardiovascular event acquire patient . Written information send patient least 1 week prior CT . The sample store cod , Biobank Maastricht , maximum duration 15 year . Once measurement sample perform , serum sample send Biobank cod analyze researcher , access key file code link specific hospital identity number . This file store independent researcher Cardiology department Maastricht University Medical Center . The assessment atherosclerotic burden coronary tree perform cardiac MDCT specialist blind clinical data serum biomarker outcome . Biomarker level correlate severity amount coronary artery disease assess cardiac MDCT .</brief_summary>
