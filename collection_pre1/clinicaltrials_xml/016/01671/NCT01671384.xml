	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy autosomal recessive disease vary severity destroy motor neuron , result atrophy weakness voluntary muscle . Around 95 % case demonstrate homozygous deletion/mutation involve exon 7 SMN1 ( survival motor neuron 1 ) , result biochemical deficiency SMN protein . Although pathogenesis spinal muscular atrophy remain speculative , several hypothesis include defective inhibition apoptosis , glutamate excitotoxicity lack neurotrophic factor ( ) nerve muscle . Valproic acid ( VPA ) , histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , directly increase SMN expression SMA patient-derived cell line vitro . It also demonstrate neuroprotective property glutamate induced excitotoxicity via up-regulation alphasynuclein increase neurite outgrowth vitro . The molecular genetic basis spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) , autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder , loss function survival motor neuron gene ( SMN1 ) . The SMN2 gene , nearly identical copy SMN1 , detect promising target SMA therapy . Transcriptional SMN2 activation modulation splice pattern increase FL-SMN level believe clinically beneficial therefore crucial challenge SMA research . Drugs valproic acid , phenylbutyrate , sodium butyrate mainly act histone deacetylase inhibitor mediate : stimulate SMN2 gene transcription and/or restore splicing pattern , thereby elevate level FL-SMN2 protein . Till date 3 open label trial 1 placebo control RCT VPA human subject publish , indicate possible benefit strength and/or motor function . Children SMA may reduce capacity synthesis carnitine consequent significantly diminish skeletal muscle mass . VPA independently inhibit carnitine transport metabolites deplete carnitine level bind . So along valproate patient supplement carnitine . Childhood spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) common autosomal recessive disorder , characterize muscle weakness due degeneration motor neuron spinal cord brain stem nuclei . Progression disease due loss anterior horn cell , think cause apoptosis . Positional cloning strategy reveal several gene candidate include gene Survival Motor Neuron ( SMN ) neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein ( NAIP ) . Both gene duplicate chromosome 5 . The survival motor neuron transcript encode two gene , SMNT SMNC . The autosomal recessive proximal SMA map 5q12 caused mutation SMNT gene . SMNT exon 7 detect approximately 95 % SMA case either deletion sequence conversion event . Recently international collaborative effort European Neuromuscular SMA Consortium , note , establish diagnostic criterion . 1 . Weakness central feature . The weakness symmetrical , proximal distal , accompany hypotonia . The trunk commonly involve . Weakness legs characteristically great arm . 2 . Denervation demonstrate electromyography , muscle biopsy clinical criterion . Recently , presence survival motor gene defect become accepted reliable diagnostic test spinal muscular atrophy . Possible therapeutic strategy include use motor neurotrophic agent , glutamate inhibitor , histone deacetylase inhibitor embryonic graft . Valproate , short chain fatty acid histone deacetylase inhibitor show increase protein level SMN2 2 4 fold transcription activation restoration correct splice SMN 2 via increase level Htra2-beta1 fibroblast cell line SMA patient also show raise SMN protein level also neuronal tissue.11 Till date 3 open label trial 1 placebo control RCT VPA human subject publish , indicate possible benefit strength motor function . Recently result CARNI-VAL ( valproate carnival ) trial publish . It multicentric trial 2 part . The 1st one double blind placebo control randomised trial 61 SMA patient age 2 8 year . It indicate possible benefit motor function strength young patient favourable normal BMI profile . The 2nd one prospective single arm trial valproate carnitine 33 ambulatory child SMA age 3-17 year . No significant improvement note muscle strength functional status 12 month period . Valproate FDA approve drug use three decade epilepsy treatment . Common side effect dyspepsia / weight gain . Less common side effect dysphoria , fatigue , dizziness , drowsiness , hair loss , headache , nausea , sedation tremor . It also cause hyperammonemia . It also report cause blood dyscrasia , impair liver function , jaundice , thrombocytopenia prolong coagulation time . Because effective therapy SMA , management till date consist prevent treat complication . Complications severe weakness include restrictive lung disease , poor nutrition , orthopedic deformity , immobility psychosocial problem . Gene-specific therapy yet available . Noninvasive ventilation percutaneous gastrostomy reportedly improve quality life effect survival . The goal active nonfatiguing exercise maintain range motion , increase muscle flexibility , prevent contracture . Genetic counseling offer family patient 's SMA . Sample size This calculate MMT primary outcome use repeated measure design ( 1 pre 4 post measurement ) . Assuming mean ± SD MMT score control group enrollment 120± 55 ( base baseline status patient attend routine myopathy clinic ) expect improvement least 30 % intervention arm ( i.e. , 156± 55 ) , correlation coefficient 0.6 , 90 % power 5 % 2 side α ( i.e. , 95 % CI ) , investigator require minimum 25 case group . Considering 20 % loss follow investigator would enroll 30 child 2 study arm , i.e. , total 60 case . Randomization : Block randomization variable block size use generate random number allocation study child one two group . Interim analysis It do 20 patient enrol assess efficacy drug . If efficacy clear cut continuation study justify . Patient recruitment All patient diagnosis SMA age 2-15 year already register Myopathy Clinic AIIMS recall . Information send Government Hospitals Delhi study currently progress referral also recruit . These patient newly diagnose Myopathy Clinic , AIIMS randomize two group : Group I ( Physiotherapy + Placebos ) Group II ( Physiotherapy + Valproate Levocarnitine ) Patients weigh less 20 kg receive liquid formulation either sodium Valproateor placebo . Patients weigh 20 kg receive oral tablet either sodium Valproate/ placebo . Day 1-Day 10 Day 11- Day 20 Day 21 onwards &lt; 10 Kg 1 ml BD 2 ml BD 2 ml TDS 11-15 Kg 1.5 ml BD 2 ml TDS 3 ml TDS 16-20 Kg 2 ml BD 3 ml TDS 4 ml TDS 21-25 Kg 100 mg ( 1 tab BD ) 200 mg ( 1 tab BD ) 200 mg ( 1 tab TDS ) 26-30 Kg 100 mg ( 1 tab TDS ) 200 mg ( 1 tab TDS ) 200 mg ( 2 -1-1 ) 31-35 Kg 100 mg ( 1 tab TDS ) 200 mg ( 1 tab TDS ) 200 mg ( 2-1-2 ) All patient intervention arm supplement Carnitine 50mg per kg per day ( maximum 1000mg ) 2 divide dos entire period valproate therapy .The group receive placebo . The investigator blind code medicine . It broken end study significant side effect . Valproate already use patient epilepsy significant side effect . Till date , besides conservative management treatment SMA available . This trial thus justify . Periodic evaluation data do Data Safety Management Board ( DSMB ) comprise eminent expert . Informed consent It take duly made consent form start study . The patient parent 's right withdraw study point time disadvantage patient . No harmful effect expect case research related injury , best possible care AIIMS provide . A detailed history physical examination carry predesigned proforma . All child undergo DNA test exon7 deletion SMNT gene . All CPK level routine hemogram liver function test . If exon7 deletion absent , EMG , NCV muscle biopsy perform . Baseline assessment include detailed muscle chart 5 point scale per principle manual muscle test child physiotherapist . Other test include functional measure use modify Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale ( MHFMS ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) wherever possible . Patients clinically evaluate 12 , 24 , 36 52 week history , examination careful muscle charting . Other test include functional measure use modify Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale ( MHFMS ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) wherever possible . Compliance ensure every visit check medicine packet leftover medicine . At 24 week 52 week follow routine hemogram , liver function test additionally 52 week serum valproate level also do . MMT ( manual muscle test ) score express total score 340 . Similarly modify Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale ( MHFMS ) score express total score . FVC ( Forced vital capacity ) express Litres . Serum Valproate level express mg/ml . Side effect profile valproate express incidence patient symptom mention . Incidence patient low platelet count ( le 1.5lacs/mm3 ) elevate liver enzyme ( OT PT 40U/ L ) record . Mean± 2SD change MMT score , MHFMS score FVC visit analyse use Wilcockson ranksum test T test .</detailed_description>
