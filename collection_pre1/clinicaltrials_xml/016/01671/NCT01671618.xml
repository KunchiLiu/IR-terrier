	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective study compare point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasound ( FOCUS ) thoracic compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) measurement ascend aortic dimension . We hypothesize FOCUS demonstrate good agreement CTA measurement ascend aortic dimension accurately detect dilation aneurysmal disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nonspecific chest pain frequently encounter emergency department . Accounting 13,000 death annually , aortic aneurysmal disease potential cause chest pain.There multiple diagnostic imaging modality practice interrogate thoracic aorta , common compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) , trans-thoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) trans-esophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) , advantage limitation . In ED setting , point-of-care ( POC ) focus cardiac ultrasound ( FOCUS ) increasingly use adjunct emergency physician 's ( EP ) workup undifferentiated chest pain . Based prior retrospective data FOCUS CTA appear good agreement . This study aim confirm finding prospective evaluation Specific Aims Aim 1 : To prospectively compare Point Care ( POC ) Focused Cardiac Ultrasound ( FOCUS ) thoracic compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) measurement ascend aortic dimension . Maximal diameter measurement ascend thoracic aorta FOCUS compare CTA . Bland Altman plot 95 % limit agreement use determine clinical statistical significance . Hypothesis : 95 % limit agreement FOCUS CTA within +/- 5 mm . Aim 2 : To determine diagnostic accuracy Point-of-Care Focused Cardiac Ultrasound detection thoracic aortic dilation aneurysm compute tomographic angiography reference standard Sensitivity , Specificity Accuracy FOCUS compute CTA reference standard .</detailed_description>
