	<detailed_description>International data report population prediabetes approximately twice population Diabetes Mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) U.S. Latin America . Given prediabetes estimate prevalence Chile ( 8 15 % ) consider high risk develop DM2 prediabetic people present , well high cost associate treat disease consequence , essential look strategy prevent and/or delay process . People 45 year overweight alter glucose tolerance test constitute population high risk develop DM2 ( MINSAL , 2009 ) . It show weight loss increase moderate physical activity reduce 58 % risk develop DM2 ( The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group , 2002 ) , however , primary care , people inform prediabetes usually present access available service support process change behavior core condition . This study aim design , implement evaluate multi-component remote care model support people prediabetes overweight obese , self-management risk behavior unhealthy diet physical inactivity . This study seek determine whether remote care intervention aim overweight obese people prediabetes , carry professional train motivational interviewing , behavior change theory support health decision-making , knowledge prediabetes effective intervention cop effective : ) Increase participant knowledge risk condition prevent b ) Provide effective support result increase daily physical activity c ) Provide effective support ensure change eat habit ) Achieve reduction clinical parameter value glucose , cholesterol triglyceride e ) Attain decrease anthropometric parameter body weight waist circumference ( associate modification unwanted habit ) . The counsel intervention core multi-component remote care model , also include counsel text message , purveyance educational material , self-monitoring equipment ( pedometer measure tape patient check waist circumference ) . The call make professional work health center train apply theory behavioral change decision-making . Phone counsel conduct least month . Three different type counsel include : ( ) Welcome : aim explore factor promote behavioral change goal patient must reach deal prediabetes ; ( b ) Follow-up : aim accompany patient and/or monitoring attainment goal associate desired behavioral change , ( c ) Completion : closing intervention process , reinforce achievement , invite patient maintain behavioral change make . Short Message Service ( SMS ) counseling aim provide information encouraging patient change his/her behavior term nutrition physical activity . Messages send weekly relate topic refer counseling session . The educational material equipment -- respectively -- seek provide additional information foster habit self-monitoring progress and/or reversion change process . A randomized clinical study design , include sample 70 ( group ) people diagnose prediabetes alter BMI , register 5 primary care center La Florida commune , Santiago , Chile . The intervention last 6 month . The control group receive usual care health center consist indication physical activity healthy eating recommendation , well referral Dietitian appropriate , invitation participate educational activity health center periodic inspection appointment . Apart usual care provide health center , intervention group also receive four component remote care model . Pre post intervention measurement apply . At end intervention ( post-measurement ) control group participant invite participate educational workshop improve eating practice physical activity , receive educational material generate project , thus ensure principle equity project 's development . For intervention group , program expect lead increase knowledge prediabetes , increment physical activity , improvement clinical anthropometric parameter well eat habit , non expect result control group .</detailed_description>
