Postmenopausal ( 12 consecutive month spontaneous amenorrhea ) , 2 . Surgically sterile , 3 . Females childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test Qualification Enrollment Visit prior dose Day 1 . Females childbearing potential must agree abstain sexual activity could result pregnancy agree use acceptable method contraception . For subject transition directly feeder protocol initiate treatment chelator SSP004184AQ : Willing discontinue exist iron chelation therapy minimum period 1 5 day prior first dose SSP004184AQ . ( Note : This inclusion criterion also applicable subject receive chelators SSP004184AQ feeder protocol . ) Serum ferritin great 500 ng/mL Qualification Enrollment Visit . Liver iron concentration ( LIC ) great equal 2.0 mg iron per g ( equivalent dry weight , liver ) determine FerriScan® R2 MRI Qualification Enrollment Visit ( Day 28 Day 8 ) . ( Note : Younger subject MRI feasible consider iron overload basis serum ferritin . ) Mean previous 3 pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration great equal 7.5 g/dL . Exclusion : Unwilling remain exist chelation therapy SSP004184AQ dose 24 hour last dose . A history noncompliance prior FerroKin/Shiresponsored SSP004184AQ study ( exclude dose suspension medically warrant ) . Cardiac MRI T2* le 10.0 millisecond Qualification Enrollment Visit .
