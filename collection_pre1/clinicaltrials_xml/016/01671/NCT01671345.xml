	<brief_title>An Educational Intervention Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Diabetes estimate affect 1 5 VA patient overall 1 4 racial/ethnic minority patient . Patients low health literacy minority group difficulty communicate physician , report low adherence physician ' recommendation , high rate poor diabetes outcome . Activating patient use effective communication physician ' lead well adherence treatment well biomedical outcome . In project investigator build upon prior work two HSRD fund pilot project improve doctor patient communication patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . In previously fund short-term project , SHP-08-182 , investigator conduct focus group patient T2DM elicit understand patient perspective , barrier communicate physician . This qualitative work use subsequent pilot project , PPO-08-402 refine pilot test educational video encourage patient use active participatory communication visit physician . This work successfully complete product 10 minute video test find acceptable patient feasible patient view immediately precede medical encounter . Objectives : In project investigator propose test effectiveness video intervention improve patient ' communication . The primary aim conduct randomize control trial intervention test whether intervention increase patient ' active participatory communication behavior , patient ' post-visit rating self efficacy communicate , medication adherence , diabetic control ( HgbA1c ) . There four secondary aim include assessment ( 1 ) mediator , ( 2 ) moderator relationship intervention condition outcome , ( 3 ) cost intervention , ( 4 ) evaluation feasibility use video pre-visit preparation . Methods : The investigator conduct two group , pre-post , randomize control , single-site trial intervention patient T2DM . The investigator recruit 156 patient physicians pre post-intervention visit . Physicians trained agenda set module Four Habits model . Patients randomized view 10 minute intervention control video prior second visit . Visits audio record analyzed patient ' physician ' communication behavior . Self-efficacy communicate collect self report . Adherence collect self-report medication possession ratio . Diabetic control collect chart review . Analyses evaluate relationship intervention condition outcome , mediator moderator relationship , estimate cost intervention feasibility use video busy clinic . Impacts : VA transformation effort include interprofessional Patient Aligned Care Teams ( PACT ) focus attention patient-centered care . Improved communication central feature patient center care . Communication medical interaction critical play important , often overlooked role health-care decision making quality care . Patients difficulty communicate less involved consultation physician , receive less information support , less satisfied care . In turn , patient may understand treatment option , may less knowledge , less positive belief treatment less trust physician , may experience poor health outcome . Teaching patient communicate effectively patient-centered inherently support patient-driven approach deliver healthcare . The investigator ' intervention design encourage patient ' active communication . Improving patient ' communication unique focus may supplement add VA effort area Patient Aligned Care Team . In addition , methodology disease specific may paradigm improvement condition .</detailed_description>
