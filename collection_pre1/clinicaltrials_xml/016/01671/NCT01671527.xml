	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine physical brain change people cervical dystonia deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery compare healthy control . We measure body 's response transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) and/or DBS surgery . TMS non-invasive procedure sit chair look like one would find dentist 's office . A nerve stimulator place wrist right hand stimulate median nerve ; intensity nerve stimulator gradually increase right thumb begin twitch . A magnetic coil place scalp one side head , overlie brain 's motor cortex , stimulate brain 's output muscle opposite hand . If control subject , therefore not/have DBS surgery , measure body 's response TMS comparison purpose . We expect electrical difference brain may relate physical benefit patient primary cervical dystonia receive DBS surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects participate 1-3 visit , base eligibility , describe : Study Visit 1 : Baseline - This visit apply subject cervical dystonia planning DBS surgery next 1-4 week - This visit apply subject cervical dystonia planning DBS surgery - This visit ( except # 3 ) applies healthy control subject ; visit healthy control subject 1 . A neurological examination special attention sensory system perform . The sensory system system brain receive perceives feeling different part body . 2 . Women child-bearing potential give urine pregnancy test evaluate pregnancy status . 3 . DYSTONIA SUBJECTS ONLY : Clinical assessment dystonia perform administer several scale measure , include : Toronto Western Cervical Dystonia Rating Scale ( TWSTRS ) , Short Form ( SF-36 ) scale quality life assessment , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) assessment dystonia pain severity , Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) cognitive test , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI II ) , evaluation mood . 4 . We determine individual motor evoke potential ( MEP ) threshold begin study treatment . Your MEP record muscle locate right thumb index finger right hand , leave hand . MEP threshold refers amount stimulation brain required activate muscle cell enough appear electromyography ( EMG ) , record electrical potential muscle electrode place skin . 5 . We test sensory system interaction motor cortex use transcranial magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) . For test , sit chair look like one would find dentist 's office . A nerve stimulator place wrist right hand stimulate median ulnar nerve . The intensity nerve stimulator gradually increase right thumb begin twitch . A magnetic coil place scalp left side head , overlie brain 's motor cortex , stimulate brain 's output muscle opposite hand . This procedure repeat use left wrist right side head . 6 . We spend additional 30 minute perform protocol allow test plasticity change brain . This protocol call pair associative stimulation ( PAS ) . The median nerve wrist TMS coil head undergo repeat paired stimulation . Such repeated pairing build plasticity effect motor cortex . MEP , explain earlier , record protocol . 7 . Subjects provide consent videotape visit . Study Visit 2 : - This visit identical Visit 1 subject cervical dystonia planning DBS - This visit , describe , applies subject cervical dystonia DBS le 3 month prior 1 . This study visit involve 2 condition perform approximately 3 month DBS surgery span 3 day . For condition DBS stimulator keep either ON OFF . 2 . A physical examination , include clinical dystonia rating scale TMS test use Visit 1 , administer recorded condition . 3 . PAS , describe Visit 1 , perform ON OFF stimulation test plasticity effect DBS surgery . 4 . Additionally , woman childbearing potential give urine pregnancy test evaluate pregnancy status . 5 . Subjects provide consent videotaped . Visit 3 : - This visit apply subject DBS surgery 6 month prior 1 . The method plan identical use Visit 2 .</detailed_description>
