	<brief_summary>Cellulitis medical term infection skin , symptom include redness , swell , warmth , pain . This group symptoms call inflammation , cause body 's immune system respond infection . Standard care cellulitis use antibiotic destroy infection , inflammation persist cause great deal pain . The hypothesis study add single dose oral steroid ( prednisone ) , temper immune response , reduce inflammation , reduce pain , speed recovery . This hypothesis examine recruit group patient cellulitis , randomize two sub-groups : one group receive dose prednisone , group receive placebo . Neither group know receive unless problem . These subject follow 48 hour mark 7 day mark , result compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Single Dose Oral Prednisone Treatment Cellulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study conduct prospective , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized fashion use convenience sample 100 subject come ED sign symptom cellulitis . Initial medical assessment make attending/senior resident accord establish clinical procedure , include history , physical examination , vital sign . If clinical assessment patient meet eligibility criterion , approach research associate screening , informed consent process , enrollment study , data collection . After subject understand sign inform consent form , randomize either placebo group treatment group . The EMCP pharmacy charge randomization process . Once randomize , standard source document ( see data management section appendix C detail ) fill information give subject chart . While study medication give ( time zero ) , subject receive Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) rate pain upon initial presentation along determination size cellulitic area . This do determine long axis cellulitic area measuring ( mm ) proximal/lateral end towards distal/medial end , exclude lymphangitic spread . The proximal distal area erythema outline . While standard treatment care cellulitis circumscribe accord already establish protocol , class antibiotic pain control patient receive depend disposition : If discharge : 1 . Antibiotic prescription TMP/SMX 160/800 mg ( Bactrim DS ) , 2 pill PO BID Cephalexin 500 mg PO qid ; allergic , Clindamycin 300 mg PO QID . 2 . Pain control : stay ED subject receive , accord allergic history long treat physician determines necessary address pain , two tablet either Percocet 5/325 mg , Vicodin 5/500 mg ( allergic Percocet ) , Acetaminophen 500 mg dose . Once discharged receive , accord allergic history physician 's clinical judgement , prescription 12 tablet either Percocet 5/325 mg , Vicodin 5/500 mg ( allergic Percocet ) , Tylenol # 3 300/30 mg , Acetaminophen 500 mg , one tablet PO q6 PRN pain . Pain medication must include NSAIDs . If admit observation unit : antibiotic IV Clindamycin 300 mg q6 hour ; allergic , IV Vancomycin 1 g q12 hour give . For pain control : Morphine 4 mg IV q4 hour PRN pain ; allergic , Dilaudid 1 mg IV q4 hour PRN pain . Pain medication must include NSAIDs . Once discharge , receive prescription discharge group subject . In addition standard care describe additional medication deem appropriate attend physician represent confound factor study ( NSAIDs , antibiotic ) , subject also receive additional pill either prednisone 60 mg placebo . If treat physician feel best interest subject break protocol , subject 's participation study procedure end . Data already collect kept , may analyze separately . Once subject receive study medication , follow disposition ( either discharge admit observation 's unit ) . To assure treatment compliance , Research Associate provide subject antibiotics pain medication treatment correspond first 48 hour . After landmark , subject cover rest treatment . Subjects instructed take medication outside prescription length study . If subject take NSAIDs first 48 hour , could consider confound factor . As , subject take NSAIDs within first 48 hour participation study procedure end . Their already collect data keep may analyze separately ; however , take NSAIDs 48-hour visit study participation continue . Subjects require return ED 48 hour bring remain prescribed pain medication . They meet Research Associate re-evaluation , do use VAS , measure cellulitic area , assess degree usage prescribe pain medication . This second visit part standard care patient wo n't require receive formal evaluation ED doctor register triage . Financial compensation provide completion 48 hour follow-up visit patient . A seventh ( Â± one ) day follow-up call do ass pain severity , degree symptomatic recovery disappearance erythema , need additional medical assistance .</detailed_description>
