	<brief_title>Dose Dense TC + Pegfilgrastim Support Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A standard chemotherapy treatment option breast cancer surgery ( adjuvant therapy ) docetaxel + cyclophosphamide ( TC ) . This study look different schedule give adjuvant chemotherapy treatment complete faster ( 8 week rather 12 week ) . This study use growth factor drug , pegfilgrastim , help build blood cell lower chemotherapy , make possible receive TC treatment every 2 week ( refer `` dose dense TC '' `` ddTC '' ) instead standard 3 week schedule . The main study procedure blood draw , chemotherapy treatment , physical exam , pegfilgrastim injection .</detailed_description>
