	<brief_title>Point-of-Care Ultrasound Emergency Department Evaluation Syncope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Syncope one common presentation Emergency Department , represent 1.2-1.5 % evaluate patient 6 % admission . Due often broad overlap differential diagnosis , syncope represent disease entity often require extensive workup . This typically involve laboratory test , EKGs , x-rays , computed tomography , study costly , time-consuming , , case diagnostic imaging , frequently involve ionize radiation . Yet , despite extensive testing , exact diagnosis make 50 % case . Cardiac cause syncope include myocardial infarction , pericardial effusion , volume depletion , arrhythmia , among entity , many life threaten . Echocardiography ( cardiac ultrasound ) use inpatient syncope evaluation several decade . In Emergency Department , echocardiography currently use point-of-care ( POC ) limit focused approach variety condition . However , POC ultrasound never systematically evaluate diagnostic prognostic tool specifically syncope Emergency Department . We aim determine ultrasound-based protocol effective adjunct evaluation syncope . Our research study examine utility POC ultrasound diagnosis , image laboratory utilization , prognosis syncope Emergency Department .</detailed_description>
