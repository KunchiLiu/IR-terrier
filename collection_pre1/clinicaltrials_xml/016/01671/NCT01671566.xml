	<brief_title>Interval Training Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number adult congenital heart disease increase . Thanks advance medical surgical field number adult complex congenital heart disease high child correspond heart disease . Though long term prognosis still unknown continuously change new therapeutic option introduce . Persons congenital heart disease different degree impair exercise capacity compare healthy control . Some study indicate population sufficiently active achieve recommendation physical activity prevent acquire heart disease . Physical inactivity important risk factor develop acquire heart disease life style diseases obesity diabetes . In population one previous cardiac surgery common , prevention life style diseases especially important . Exercise train heart failure coronary artery disease well studied clinical guideline . Regarding exercise training adult congenital heart disease , however , information sparse study need . Based defined inclusion exclusion criterion adult complex congenital heart disease recruit Northern Health Care Region Sweden Gothenburg . Before twelve week intervention period investigator collect information cardiopulmonary exercise capacity , health relate quality life , exercise self-efficacy , anxiety depression . The patient randomize twelve week home base interval train control group . The randomization ratio 2:1 ( intervention : control ) . The control group instruct continue habitual physical activity . The home base interval train program individualize base result exercise test . The aim study examine effect home base interval training maximal submaximal exercise capacity , quality life , exercise self-efficacy , anxiety depression .</detailed_description>
