	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test brentuximab vedotin effect cancer patient certain type large B-Cell Lymphoma . The side effect ( unwanted effect ) SGN-35 patient certain type large B-Cell Lymphoma also study . It known brentuximab vedotin well bad treatment might give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin CD30 Positive Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) Positive DLBCL Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brentuximab vedotin type drug call antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) . ADCs usually 2 part ; part target cancer cell ( antibody ) cell kill part ( chemotherapy ) . Antibodies proteins part immune system . They stick attack specific target cell . The antibody part brentuximab vedotin stick target call CD30 . CD30 important molecule cancer cell ( include non-Hodgkin lymphoma ) normal cell immune system . The cell kill part brentuximab vedotin chemotherapy call monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) . After brentuximab vedotin attache CD30 part cell , MMAE enters cell kill . More 350 people cancer already give brentuximab vedotin research study . These research study do test safety different dos brentuximab vedotin find brentuximab vedotin active cancer .</detailed_description>
