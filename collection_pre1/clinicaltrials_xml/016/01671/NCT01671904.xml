	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open-label , dose-finding study evaluate safety pharmacokinetics venetoclax ( GDC-0199 , ABT-199 ) administer combination bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) ( MabThera/Rituxan ) bendamustine obinutuzumab ( BG ) participant relapsed/refractory previously untreated CLL . The study explore two schedule drug administration , Schedule A ( venetoclax introduce agent ) Schedule B ( introduced agent ) . In addition , study explore two venetoclax combination regimen : venetoclax+BR venetoclax + BG ( latter optional ) . The study comprise two stage participant population : dose-finding stage safety-expansion stage . The dose-finding stage explore multiple dos venetoclax use combination fix dose BR BG .</brief_summary>
