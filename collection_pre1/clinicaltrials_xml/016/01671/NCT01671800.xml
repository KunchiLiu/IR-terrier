	<brief_summary>The objective study determine Myobloc significantly decrease prosthesis-associated symptomatic sweating amputee compare saline solution placebo . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial total enrollment 32 amputee subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Botulinum Toxin B ( Myobloc ) Treatment Prosthesis-associated Sweating</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients amputation experience severe sweating due socket liner use fitted prosthesis . This excessive sweating cause inadequate fit function prosthesis well discomfort . The treatment modality technique use base upon successful prior open-labeled pilot study do research group investigate effect Botulinum Toxin A ( BOTOX ) residual limb hyperhidrosis , demonstrate significant decrease sweat amputee residual limb hyperhidrosis treat BOTOX . Each subject undergo baseline test consist 15 minute walk treadmill ( use handcycle ) light exertion ( 11 Berg scale ) . They report effect sweat prosthesis fit function past month , amount sweat produce 15 minute measure via gravimetric assessment . At end baseline session , subject receive either drug placebo injection residual limb area identify troublesome sweating . Subjects return 1-month follow-up session questionnaire , walk test , sweat collection re-administered . At one-month follow-up session , subject receive placebo felt successful decrease sweat give opportunity cross-over drug arm trial .</detailed_description>
