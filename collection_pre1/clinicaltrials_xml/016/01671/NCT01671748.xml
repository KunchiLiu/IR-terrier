	<detailed_description>Venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) wound often chronic difficult heal . VLUs affect 1 3.2 people per 1000 ; cause pain , reduce mobility impact negatively patient ' quality life ( QoL ) . Standard treatment patient VLUs application strong , sustained compression bandage stocking . This pragmatically-designed study aim determine whether use device call MIST use combination standard treatment improve heal VLUs compare UK standard practice . It also show whether MIST regimen improve participant ' QoL reduces incidence infection . The MIST ultrasound system non-contact device delivers low-frequency ultrasound gentle saline mist direct patient 's wound . Patients ( 18 year old ) invite take part study VLU 6 week , measure 5 100 cm^2 , infect . Participants diabetes must show good blood glucose control , underlie chronic disorder may affect wound heal exclude . All study participant receive four week standard treatment week single clinic Wound Healing Research Unit ( WHRU ) , University Hospital Wales . Patients whose wound reduce 40 % time withdrawn study . Remaining patient randomly allocate either active group control group receive eight week treatment . Participants active group receive treatment MIST device three time week , well standard care ( change compression bandage dressing ) three time week . The control group receive UK standard care ( dress compression bandage change least week ) . The participant ' ulcer measure photographed week , wound characteristic assess . Changes participant ' health relate QoL assess use questionnaire begin end trial . Wound recurrence rate 90 day end treatment assessed telephoning patient .</detailed_description>
