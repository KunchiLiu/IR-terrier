	<brief_summary>The propose study aim test impact microEEG clinical management ( diagnosis treatment ) emergency department patient Altered Mental Status ( AMS ) . The study utilize portable , wireless , FDA-approved device ( microEEG ) intervention . Patients randomize routine care plus microEEG ( experimental arm ) routine care alone ( control arm ) . The investigator hypothesize incorporate microEEG work patient AMS impact clinical management patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately , 4 % 10 % emergency department ( ED ) patient United States present alter mental status ( AMS ) . According previous study , close 30 % AMS case occur due neurological etiology . Among pathology non-convulsive seizure ( NCS ) non-convulsive status epilepticus ( NCSE ) . In previous study , investigator establish approximately 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 2-8 % ) ED patient AMS suffer NCS NCSE . Our study also reveal 78 % ED patient AMS form EEG abnormality . NCS NCSE difficult diagnose especially AMS patient perform thorough physical examination obtain medical history often impossible altered patient . Definitive diagnosis NCS/NCSE require electroencephalography ( EEG ) , test record brain electrical activity provide information brain function . Unfortunately , obtain EEG ED challenge . This require transport EEG machine patient 's bedside , space limitation presence variety monitor device , especially over-crowded EDs render practice difficult . In many institution EEG service offer work hour due unavailability 24/7 EEG technologist coverage real-time electroencephalographer interpretation . As result aforementioned limitation , ED physicians may refrain order EEG . The wireless portable EEG device ( microEEG ) design Bio-Signal Group design address limitation . With minimal training , ED personnel could use small , microEEG device obtain EEG . The record wirelessly transmit host computer via secure network connection neurology expert could interpret EEG . Incorporating microEEG initial workup patient AMS could help ED attend rule NCS/NCSE focus diagnosis . Alternatively , presence NCS confirm EEG , treatment could initiate early potentially reduce morbidity mortality . The investigator hypothesize incorporate EEG work ED patient AMS could impact management ( diagnosis treatment ) patient influence clinical outcome . Sample size : Our sample size analysis use data one publish relate study revel study would need 65 patient group ( total n:130 ) . However , investigator plan perform interim analysis enrol half target sample adjust sample size calculation base collect data necessary .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ED patient â‰¥ 18 year old AMS . 1 . Patients apparent immediately correctable cause AMS ( determine ED attend initial evaluation ) include : Fingerstick serum glucose less 60mg/dl Hypothermia ( Hypothermia define body temperature 35.0 C [ 95.0 F ] ) . Hyperthermia , heat exhaustion heat stroke Opioid overdose respond Narcan . 2 . Patients undergo EEG recording reason ( e.g . severe scalp injury ) . 3 . Hemodynamically unstable patient ( SBP &lt; 90mm Hg ) 4 . Patients uncooperative combative . 5 . Patients transfer ED enrollment . 6 . Patients obvious tonicclonic focal seizure ED . Note : Patients hypoglycemia return baseline level mental status within 30 minute correct blood glucose level , enrol . Similarly , patient obvious seizure ED return baseline mental status within 15 minute also enrol .</criteria>
