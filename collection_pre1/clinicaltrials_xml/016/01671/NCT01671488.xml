	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Evaluation ADXS11-001 , Mitomycin , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) IMRT Anal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel treatment need anal cancer . An important percentage patient locally advanced anal cancer persistent loco-regional disease develop systemic metastasis . Virtually case anal cancer relate infection HPV . Anal cancer cell infect HPV tumor associate antigen HPV E7 . ADXS11-001 cause antigen present cell stimulate facilitate immune cell attack cancer cell express HPV E7 . ADXS11-001 , phase II dose 1x109 CFU , show safe patient advanced cervical cancer also cause HPV infection . Anti-tumor activity safety demonstrate cervical cancer single agent ADXS11-001 combination ADXS11-001 cisplatin chemotherapy . Data present ASCO 2012 ADXS11-001 currently evaluate woman United States cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . Radiation may augment activity ADXS11-001 increasing exposure tumor relate antigen thereby increase chance loco-regional disease eradication prevent systemic recurrence . Therefore , ADXS11-001 may increase complete response , prevent recurrence disease increase disease-free overall survival anal cancer . This protocol develop sufficient preliminary safety efficacy data facilitate investigation ADXS11-001 anal cancer within `` NRG '' , newly form cooperative group base merger RTOG , NSABP GOG . As described , Phase I study preliminary data phase II study demonstrate ADXS11-001 , 1x109 CFU , safely administer single agent combination chemotherapy . For example 200 patient treat dose 1x109CFU case severe listeria bacteremia grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicity . However , since ADXS11-001 previously administer radiation , primary objective study establish safety addition ADXS11-001 chemoradiation anal cancer . The following schedule assess . - Treatment Schedule # 1 : The first dose give 10-14 day prior initiation chemoradiation . The 2nd-4th dosage ADXS11-001will completion chemoradiation . The second dosage ADXS11-001 administer minimum 10 day completion chemoradiation , ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3 , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl toxicity chemoradiation resolve grade 2 less . The subsequent third fourth treatment ADXS11 administer 28 day interval . This provide need safety data evaluate Treatment Schedule # 2 . - Treatment Schedule # 2 : If dose limit toxicity ( define ) exceed Treatment Schedule # 1 , Treatment Schedule # 2 investigate administration second dose ADXS11-001 day 21 chemoradiation . Administration ADXS11-001 day 21 chemoradiation would administer ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3 , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl toxicity ongoing chemoradiation grade 2 less . The third treatment ADXS11-001 would administer less 10 day completion chemoradiation , ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3 , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl toxicity ongoing chemoradiation grade 2 less . The fourth treatment would 28 day later . Standard treatment mitomycin , 5-FU radiation anal cancer substantial toxicity . In RTOG 9811 , 74 % patient grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity 61 % patient grade 3 grade 4 hematologic toxicity regimen . Therefore , toxicity standard chemoradiation mitomycin , 5-FU radiation well conventionally accept parameter phase I study even prior add ADXS11-001 . However , critical addition ADXS-11-001 compromise delivery potentially curative standard chemoradiation anal cancer .</detailed_description>
