Drinking level compromise antiretroviral ( ART ) treatment , increase rate depression , unsafe sex , mortality . The propose randomized trial examines comparative effectiveness two highly implementable behavioral intervention reduce hazardous drinking , adaptive , stepped-care component : 1 ) Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , consist one in-person session study clinician two phone session , three additional phone session report hazardous drink 6 month ; 2 ) Interactive Email Feedback ( EF ) hazardous drinking risk use secure message system integrate Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) , additional email feedback report hazardous drink 6 month . A third arm usual care . We also evaluate cost-effectiveness two intervention potential wide adoption similar healthcare setting . The two propose intervention , MI EF , promise approach reduce hazardous drink set behavioral health and/or primary care . EF also use secure messaging , emerge technology test health , behavior change mental health treatment setting , problem include alcohol use among HIV-infected individual . In trial , 600 patient ( 200 arm ) recruit Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) San Francisco . The study population clinic ideal examine intervention since NIAAA-based screening question record EMR , comprehensive data available health care utilization , ART adherence , HIV clinical outcome , include Veterans Aging Cohort Study ( VACS ) index , recently validate prognostic index base routine clinical laboratory measure . The research team well-qualified complementary expertise clinical psychology , drug alcohol abuse treatment , HIV epidemiology , biostatistics . Thus , team study set provide ideal environment test MI EF , two innovative approach reduce hazardous alcohol use population , may provide powerful , generalizable tool assist individual HIV infection .</detailed_description>
