	<brief_summary>The present study several aim : 1 . Establish whether Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Strain GG able prevent onset IBS high risk group child enrol acute gastroenteritis ( study power aim ) . 2 . Establish whether Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Strain GG able stabilize intestinal microbiota acute gastroenteritis . 3 . Define intestinal microbiota child follow acute gastroenteritis identify , possible , modification microbiota predict emergence Irritable Bowel Syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trial plan follow recommendation establish Consensus report clinical trial IBS . Children during/after acute episode gastroenteritis enter 12 month treatment ( m1-m12 ) period follow 6 month follow-up phase ( m13-m18 ) . Children assign consecutive number , start low number available , randomly assign , use computer generate randomisation list use permuted block design , receive orally either LGG ( 6 × 109 colony form unit ) placebo ( capsule identical taste appearance active study product except absence LGG ) day . Enrolled child enter sequentially receive assign treatment . Boxes contain placebo shape , dimension , indication appearance contain viable LGG provide probiotic producer ( Dicofarm SpA , Rome , Italy ) ensure study blind investigator patient . Group assignment concealed participant investigator . Power calculation With assumption , 12 month period , IBS would expect 16 % child episode acute gastroenteritis oppose 5 % general paediatric population without gastroenteritis , calculate sample 210 child per group would require study 80 % power show advantage LGG placebo reduce rate IBS , base two-sided type 1 error rate 5 % .. Eligibility Patients Patients recruit primary care paediatrician paediatric ward during/after ( less seven day ) episode gastroenteritis ( bacteria/viruses/parasites ) . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Children 2 - 16 year age ; 2 . Either sex . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Chronic disease , 2 . Clinical history abdominal pain history suggestive functional dyspepsia/aerophagia/abdominal migraine 3 . Growth failure , 4 . Alarm sign organic condition . Assessments , Compliance Adherence . During duration trial ( m1-m18 ) patient record gastrointestinal symptom monthly base follow data collect : ) questionnaire frequency/severity pain , b ) school absence c ) GI symptom score compilation gastrointestinal symptom rating score . To assess severity pain combination self-report Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Faces Pain Scale ( FPS ) use . The 0-10 mm VAS scale ( 0 pain , 10 bad possible pain ) include horizontal colour gradient ( green-red ) , plus rating . When asked evaluate pain , child would point level trace line . This particular VAS validate standard evaluate pain child older five . Assessment ease couple VAS FPS consist six face range relaxed face face show intense pain . Gastrointestinal symptom rating score ( GSRS ) consist 15-point questionnaire ass severity frequency symptom validate Svedlund et al.. During six month follow-up questionnaire compile every month GSRS month 18 . The impact parent 's overall assessment treatment obtain monthly interview question `` feel medication affect health child ? `` ; possible answer significant , mild , relief . To ensure compliance one investigator contact family every four week monitor process study . Adherence measure count number capsule return study visit ; child miss 20 % medication consider noncompliant . Outcome Measures Primary outcome incidence IBS child receive LGG compare receive placebo . We choose pain primary outcome measure , line propose points-to-consider IBS trial . IBS chronic abdominal pain diagnose categorise accord ROME III criterion . Secondary outcome : 1 ) evaluation frequency/severity symptom accord treatment arm ; 2 ) evaluation perception child 's health accord parent 3 ) modification intestinal microbiota . Intestinal microbiota The intestinal microbiota ass accord method publish elsewhere . To define modification intestinal microbiota follow acute gastroenteritis determine whether onset IBS anticipate modification intestinal microbiota proceed collection faecal sample entry , one month every two month enrolment . During six month follow-up fecal sample collect month 18 . Bacteria DNA stool extract stored -80°C future analysis . At end trial subset informative fecal bacterial DNA assess : ) patient NOT develop IBS ( LGG placebo ) , b ) patient develop IBS ( LGG placebo ) . The analysis intestinal microbiota informative case help assess whether intestinal microbiota suggestive future inset IBS ability LGG stabilize intestinal microbiota . Adverse Events Disallowed Medication Adverse event monitor throughout study . Children allow consume probiotic provide ( except transient period longer 2 week ) invite continue eat physical exercise habit . Concomitant use medication affect gastrointestinal motility and/or pain perception allow , provide parent register intake .</detailed_description>
