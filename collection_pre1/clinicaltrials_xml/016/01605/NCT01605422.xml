	<brief_summary>Dietary pulse ( bean , pea , chickpea , lentil ) , commonly know `` legume '' , generally recognize healthy component diet . Canada 's Food Guide encourage consumption meat alternative , bean `` often '' ; dietary guideline Americans recommend consumption 3 cup legumes per week . However , remain insufficient information usefulness food protect heart health . To improve evidence-based guidance dietary pulse recommendation , investigator propose conduct systematic review effect dietary pulse consumption after-meal blood sugar level , appetite , food intake regulation help explain mechanism improve longterm blood sugar body weight control . The systematic review process allow combine result many small study order arrive pool estimate , similar weighted average , true effect . The investigator able explore whether eat pulse different effect men woman , different age group background disease state , whether effect pulse depend dose background diet . The finding propose knowledge synthesis help improve health Canadians inform recommendation general public , well risk heart disease diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meta-analyses Effect Dietary Pulses Acute Postprandial Metabolic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Pulses , include dry pea , bean , lentil chickpea , rich source number healthy dietary component include dietary fiber , low glycemic index carbohydrate , vegetable protein polyphenolics . To support health claim evidence-based dietary guideline , important establish whether glycemic control weight loss benefit observe dietary pulse attributable propose mechanism-of-action , whereby reduce acute postprandial excursion glycemia contribute satiety decrease intake subsequent meal . Objectives : The objective project conduct two systematic review meta-analyses effect dietary pulse consumption acute postprandial metabolic endpoint : ( 1 ) postprandial glycemia ( 2 ) food intake regulation . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Acute , single bolus control feeding trial investigate effect isocaloric exchange dietary pulse carbohydrate food cardiometabolic risk outcome human include . Studies chronic feeding design , lack control , report comparison match available carbohydrate exclude . Data extraction : Independent investigator ( ≥2 ) extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , pulse form , dose , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean±SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Risk bias study quality assess use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool Heyland Methodological Quality Score ( MQS ) , respectively . Outcomes : Each analysis assess different set endpoint related acute postprandial metabolic control : ( 1 ) postprandial glycemia ( area curve [ AUC ] , GI ) ( 2 ) food intake regulation ( subjective appetite score , 2nd meal intake ) . Data synthesis : Separate pool analysis conduct area metabolic control use Generic Inverse Variance method random effect model . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochrane 's Q quantify I2 . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analyse include disease status , duration test , pulse type , pulse dose , study design , study quality , baseline value , change fat , protein , dietary fibre intake . Standard GI methodology compliance another priori sungroup analysis postprandial glycemia analysis . Significant unexplained heterogeneity investigate additional post hoc subgroup analysis ( e.g . age , sex , level feed control [ metabolic , supplement , dietary advice ] , washout crossover trial , energy balance background diet , composition background diet [ total % energy fat , carbohydrate , protein ] , change cholesterol intake , change glycemic index , etc. ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance subgroup analysis . Publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot application Egger 's Begg 's test . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Four Knowledge Users also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Preliminary finding : We conduct systematic review meta-analysis effect dietary pulse glycemic control 41 control feeding trial . We find pulse alone low-glycemic index high-fibre diet improve marker glycemic control . Although improvement clinically significant , come expense substantial inter-study heterogeneity . Knowledge translation preliminary project already begin . It provide rationale large trial effect pulse type 2 diabetes address identify source heterogeneity use development 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) Nutrition Therapy . Significance : The propose project demonstrate improvement longterm glycemic control see previous systematic review meta-analysis longterm randomize control feeding trial pulse attribute acute reduction postprandial glycemia , reduction appetite , decrease intake subsequent meal . This demonstration aid knowledge translation relate effect dietary pulse cardiometabolic risk , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim improve health outcome inform healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research .</detailed_description>
