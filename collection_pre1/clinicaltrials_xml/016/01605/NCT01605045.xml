	<brief_title>Screening Coronary Artery Disease Using Fluoroscopy During Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , randomized study patient undergo clinically-indicated coronary angiograpy New York University ( NYU ) Langone Medical Center cardiac catheterization laboratory . Patients randomize one two coronary angiography protocol : ( 1 ) Coronary anatomy visualize fluoroscopy , document use fluoroscopy-save function , visualize use cinematography high quality necessary ( fluoroscopy-save technique ) versus ( 2 ) Coronary anatomy visualize document use cinematography alone ( standard technique ) . The primary outcome measure radiation exposure patient , surface peak skin dose , measure Gafchromic XR RV3 film strip , place patient 's back procedure . Other outcome measure include radiation output record fluoroscopy machine , amount contrast use , quality angiogram perform . To determine quality angiogram perform use fluoroscopy-save technique non-inferior standard technique , one extra picture take random use mode study randomize . For example , fluoroscopy-save group , picture visualize cinematography study repeat documented cinematograpy . In standard group , picture repeat documented use fluoroscopy-save function . These 2 picture study collate put together particular order identifier remove . These single picture read 2 interventional cardiologist involve study blind fashion . The degree coronary artery disease determine 2 reader compare fluoroscopy-save picture cinematography picture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients recruit cardiac catheterization laboratory NYU Langone Medical Center . Patients eligible 18 year age refer coronary angiography . Patients exclude reduced renal function since must receive minimal contrast amount possible , abdominal circumference &gt; 45 inch since quality image fluoroscopy alone poor patient increase abdominal girth .</criteria>
