	<detailed_description>Objective : To compare inpatient versus outpatient preinduction cervical ripen order evaluate difference set respect patient safety , satisfaction cesarean rate . Background : Many woman require induction labor present unripe cervix . This associated long duration labor well high rate fail induction result cesarean delivery . These patient also high risk postpartum hemorrhage , blood transfusion , cesarean hysterectomy . Preinduction cervical ripening think improve likelihood successful induction woman unripe cervix . Prolonged induction labor lead patient dissatisfaction also use valuable resource available labor delivery bed nursing staff . This turn overburden labor delivery resource already tax . These issue contribute increase cost well decrease patient satisfaction . Prior study show move preinduction cervical ripening inpatient set outpatient set decrease cost significantly . It also think 50 % patient require induction labor may eligible outpatient cervical ripening . Many study look PGE two preparation longer commonly use . However , study Scisione et al . November 2001 look use Trent cervical Foley catheter purpose . They previously show mechanical method , Foley catheter , significant advantage preparation prepidil . Scisione et al . also previously show randomized trial compare misoprostol Foley catheter preinduction cervical ripening find equally effective . However , group receive misoprostol , increase risk meconium passage uterine contractile abnormality . The Foley catheter appear safe efficacious . It also appear good option outpatient preinduction cervical ripening . One downsides use Foley catheter preinduction cervical ripening require check readjust . The economic benefit outpatient cervical ripen social advantage patient seem promise . However , many woman may need return hospital result anxiety question surround use Foley catheter preinduction cervical ripening . In study Scisione et al . involve 111 woman , primary outcome variable change Bishop score . There statistically significant difference note respect group . There also statistically significant difference respect maximum dose oxytocin use subsequently labor difference amount time Pitocin use . No statistically significant difference note total induction time , cesarean delivery rate , NICU admission , Apgar score birth weight group . There difference note preinduction cervical ripen time different group . Notably , outpatient group long preinduction cervical ripening time . In aforementioned study , patient ask describe discomfort preinduction cervical ripening phase use visual analog test . This base scale 1 10 1 noted discomfort minimal discomfort 10 bad pain imaginable . The outpatient group report median discomfort level 4.8 inpatient group report discomfort level 3.9 . These result statistically significant . Most discomfort note Foley catheter placement . With respect cesarean delivery rate group note decrease note author study patient underwent outpatient cervical ripen versus underwent inpatient cervical ripening . The author study unclear reason difference . However , study underpowered detect difference give 284 patient would need group reach adequate power state whether difference note group significant . Demographically , statistically significant difference group respect maternal age , gravidity , distasteful age , amniotic fluid index , source insurance . Based result study , method equally efficacious outpatient method lead high patient satisfaction , decrease inpatient resource use lead decreased cesarean rate , may prefer method preinduction cervical ripening . Based hypothesis , investigator would like compare use foley catheter preinduction cervical ripening inpatient versus outpatient set respect patient safety , satisfaction cesarean rate . At Cedars-Sinai , approximately 7000 delivery per year . The induction rate approximate 22 % result 1540 induction per year . At present time , inpatient . Outpatient cervical ripen standard care Cedars-Sinai evaluate institution safety validate . Advantages outpatient pre-induction cervical ripening include short hospital stay , decrease cesarean section rate , improve patient comfort satisfaction . With reduced cesarean section rate , also potential decrease NICU admission . With respect potential risk outpatient induction , similar inpatient induction . Risks procedure include rupture amniotic membrane active labor . Both would result admission delivery . Methods : A randomized control trial plan woman term gestation vertex presentation , reactive nonstress test , amniotic fluid index five , Bishop score five . The primary outcome variable change Bishop score well patient satisfaction . The secondary outcome change cesarean section rate . There two group study : undergo inpatient cervical ripen undergo outpatient cervical ripening . A Foley catheter 30 mL balloon place cervix gentle traction group usual fashion currently use . The outpatient group discharge home write instruction . These patient also instruct return 12 hour placement induction . The inpatient group keep hospital time period cervical ripening . Exclusion criterion include follow : placenta previa and/or accreta , low lie placenta , undiagnosed vaginal bleeding , preeclampsia , fetal anomaly , intrauterine growth restriction , RH isoimmunization , fetal demise , rupture membrane , maternal heart disease , know latex allergy , active genital herpes infection , previous uterine surgery , limited access telephone , excessive distance hospital , and/ unreliable transportation . Upon presentation labor delivery initial assessment conduct history physical examination complete house staff . An amniotic fluid index would also obtain amniotic fluid index less five patient would consider candidate study . If patient remain candidate , procedure Foley catheter placement explain patient . Prior placement Foley , digital exam perform Bishop score assign attend senior-level resident . A number 16 Foley catheter 30 mL balloon insert endocervical canal direct visualization via speculum exam blind placement . The Foley catheter advance pass internal o subsequently fill 30 mL sterile water . The catheter place gentle traction tap catheter medial portion thigh . The nonstress test perform Foley catheter placement . If fetal heart rate reactive sign uterine tachysystole , uterine hypertonus non-reassuring fetal testing , patient randomize either group .</detailed_description>
