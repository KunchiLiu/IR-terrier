	<brief_title>Biomarker Feedback Motivate Tobacco Cessation Pregnant Alaska Native Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Developing effective tobacco cessation intervention pregnancy American Indian Alaska Native people national priority contribute U.S. public health objective reduce tobacco-related cancer health disparity . The propose project build successful partnership Alaska Native community previous work Alaska Native pregnant woman . We propose develop test novel biomarker feedback intervention relate cotinine level urine pregnant woman woman infant 's likely exposure tobacco specific nitrosamine carcinogen 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanone ) ( NNK ) . This 5-year project conduct three phase . In Phase 1 utilize non-randomized , clinical observational trial examine biomarkers nicotine carcinogen exposure ( urine cotinine total NNAL [ metabolite NNK ] , respectively ) among 150 maternal-infant pair assessment conduct pregnancy delivery . In Phase 2 , obtain qualitative feedback finding Phase 1 individual interview conduct 32 woman use tobacco develop biomarker feedback intervention message . Phase 3 consist formative evaluation biomarker feedback intervention 80 pregnant woman use two-group randomized design ass intervention 's feasibility acceptability , biochemically confirm abstinence rate end pregnancy . All phase project guide Community Advisory Committee . Each phase important step advance understand potential biomarker feedback strategy help Alaska Native pregnant woman quit tobacco use . The potential reach intervention significant public health perspective 600 tobacco user deliver year Alaska Native Medical Center Anchorage propose project take place . Developing effective intervention tobacco cessation pregnancy important reduce adverse health consequence mother neonate future risk tobacco-caused cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>To eligible woman must : 1. Alaska Native , 2. age 18 year old , 3. provide write informed consent , 4. currently pregnant ( 1st , 2nd 3rd trimester ) , 5. plan deliver ANMC . An additional inclusion criterion current tobacco user use past 7 day . Our preliminary study indicate woman may use one form tobacco . To enhance feasibility recruitment generalizability , woman exclude use one form tobacco . Instead , group composition base primary type tobacco use . An additional inclusion criterion nontobacco user use form tobacco last 6 month . 1 . Women exclude used nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) participate behavioral pharmacological tobacco cessation program within past 30 day . 2 . Alcohol drug use exclusionary criterion biomarkers specific tobacco exposure .</criteria>
