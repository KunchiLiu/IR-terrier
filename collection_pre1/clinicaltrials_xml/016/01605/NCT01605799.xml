The investigator conduct randomize , control effectiveness trial well understand six-week treatment module address impact kill added benefit , compare PTSD treatment usual ( N = 50 ) . The investigator employ concurrent design mixed method study test perception Veteran stakeholder receive treatment module , obtain rating acceptability feasibility self-report measure interview . The investigator also interview clinician provide EBT PTSD , interview guide Roger 's five intrinsic characteristic , outline Diffusion Innovations Theory . Impact : Through involve Veteran clinician stakeholder , main impact project obtain information assist revise CBT treatment module help prepare implement module already exist setting , EBT PTSD provide .</detailed_description>
