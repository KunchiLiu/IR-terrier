	<brief_summary>The investigator study two FDA-approved modality use treat overactive bladder determine improve overactive bladder without urge incontinence use together rather separately , percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) versus PTNS fesoterodine fumarate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation ( PTNS ) Versus PTNS Fesoterodine Fumarate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) describe urinary urgency without urge incontinence , usually associate urinary frequency nocturia . The primary complaint strong desire void without ability postpone micturition . Two treatment use treatment OAB pharmacotherapy percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) . Pharmacotherapy OAB base medication block muscarinic receptor detrusor muscle . These particular receptor unique bladder , however , patient complain bothersome side effect result systemic muscarinic receptor blockade . Medications successful many patient compliance poor many patient discontinue medication result side effect , cost , insufficient symptom improvement . Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) newer treatment modality provide neuromodulation pelvic floor stimulate posterior tibial nerve . This nerve access fine needle electrode insert medial portion ankle . This area long recognize nerve projection sacral nerve plexus modulate bladder activity . Several study clearly demonstrate effectiveness neuromodulation treat urge incontinence . There study compare efficacy pharmacotherapy versus PTNS . In one study , 49 % subject take fesoterodine fumarate urge incontinence report improvement symptom overactive bladder . In study , 79.5 % patient undergoing PTNS report improvement cure . Although study report similar improvement cure two treatment modality , evidence efficacy use PTNS pharmacotherapy concurrently . This study aim prove synergy two treatment modality use together effort administer small dos anticholinergic agent , obtain comparable improve urge incontinence .</detailed_description>
