	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The brain sensitive excessive insufficient flow blood . Cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) normally auto-regulated blood vessel brain , protective mechanism often disturb traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Impairment loss CBF autoregulation make brain vulnerable oscillation either arterial blood pressure ( ABP ) intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . The ideal management TBI patient , therefore , involve continuous measurement management cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP = ABP - ICP ) measurement CPP currently possible specialized equipment expertise available institution . The investigator convert no-longer used system continuously monitor CBF autoregulation use rheoencephalography ( REG ) technology modern , small , battery-powered , low-cost monitor ( aka BM-1 ) acquire REG signal use noninvasive electrode place skin/scalp . REG data use calculate optimal CPP maintain individual patient . BM-1 also capable monitoring electroencephalography ( EEG ) impedance plethysmography ( IPG ) , , respectively , use measure brain electrical activity change peripheral blood flow cause blood pressure change . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective ( Obj . 1 ) demonstrate REG acquire noninvasively equal well-established invasive method use intracranial pressure ( ICP ) monitoring , ( Obj . 2 ) retrospectively test idea TBI patient less favorable outcome CPP find less optimal use REG data , ( Obj . 3 ) determine noninvasive IPG PPG finger sensor monitoring ( used measure heart rate doctor 's office ) replace invasive monitoring arterial blood pressure ( ABP ) . METHODOLOGY : This observational study retrospective data analysis . 20 adult patient ( 18-65 yr ) acute TBI , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , enrol first-come-first-enroll basis . The enrolled patient REG , EEG IPG signal monitor duration ICU stay 15 day , whichever short . Standard neurological assessment make patient 's discharge ICU 3 month injury . The study expect end June 2013 .</brief_summary>
