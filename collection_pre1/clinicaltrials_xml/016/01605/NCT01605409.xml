	<brief_title>Emergency Cardiopulmonary Bypass Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Out hospital cardiac arrest associate poor prognosis . Overall survival varies 3 % 16 % respectively . Measures improve chance survival urgently need . If return spontaneous circulation competent cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) measure achieve within first 25 minute chance survival decrease even . Emergency Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( ECPB ) would treatment option heavily compromise patient , show considerably good result use resuscitation device cardiac arrest animal study . Material Methods : This study perform single center ( university hospital ) randomize , control prospective pilot study comprise highly experienced emergency department treat 200 300 cardiac arrest patient year . Two group analyze , ` Standard ACLS´ group ` ECPB´ group . Each group comprise 20 patient . Eligible adult patient witness hospital cardiac arrest , presume cardiac cause without return spontaneous circulation minimum 15 minute advance cardiac life support . Patients ` Standard ACLS´ group resuscitate return spontaneous circulation termination effort . The ` ECPB´ group receive ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation transport emergency department ECPB instal . Necessary diagnostic examination therapeutic intervention group perform accord guideline post resuscitation care good clinical practice . Primary outcome measure rate sustain restoration spontaneous circulation accord Utstein criterion . Secondary outcome measure 24 hour survival , survival ICU discharge , survival hospital discharge , rate best neurological recovery ( cerebral performance category score 1 2 ) within 6 month cardiac arrest modify Rankin score 6 month cardiac arrest . Patients ` Standard ACLS´ group receive standard treatment without potential additional risk . The ` ECPB´ group receive standard advanced cardiac life support well predict advantage extracorporeal oxygenation emergency department coronary intervention even return spontaneous circulation . Aim study : To compare current standard therapy patient hospital cardiac arrest ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation return spontaneous circulation termination effort ) new concept transportation ongoing cardiopulmonary reanimation installation ECPB Emergency Department improve survival .</detailed_description>
