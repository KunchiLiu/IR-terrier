	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) characterize airway inflammation infection lead progressive destruction lung . One important abnormality CF abnormal processing mutate CFTR protein endoplasmic reticulum cause abnormal location even absence protein apical plasma membrane airway epithelial cell . This abnormality result mark dehydration airway surface fluid , decrease mucus transport airway obstruction . Nevertheless , event occur early progression disease airway level infant know . At cellular level , also report CFTR expression localization could relate differentiation state airway epithelium . Furthermore , report gap junction could involve dysregulate inflammation process . In CF infant , many answer still lack . Is inflammation present infection ? Is native epithelium CF infant sensitive control ? Could investigators analyse localisation functionality CFTR , tight gap junction respiratory epithelial cell CF infant ? Could activation epithelial cell bacteria alter functional property ? For good understand early stage cystic fibrosis , major interest study respiratory epithelial cell obtain early possible . Although bronchoalveolar lavage propose purpose , nasal brushing , much less invasive technique , seldom use CF infant . investigator show , mean simple nasal brush technique easily perform well tolerate , feasible , infant , harvest native respiratory cell sheet order analyse airway epithelium functionality . In 15 CF infant 15 control infant , nasal brush perform mean soft sterile cytology brush . Samples use cytological functional study : ciliary beating frequency , cAMP-dependent chloride efflux , potassium efflux , tight gap junction functionality . These study do basal condition repeat activation nasal epithelial cell bacteria , Staphylococcus aureus , find early course CF disease . investigator believe present study could help understand pathophysiology early stage CF disease .</detailed_description>
