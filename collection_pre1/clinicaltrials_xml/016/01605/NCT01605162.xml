American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) Stage IV melanoma unresectable Stage III melanoma 7 . Measurable disease meeting follow criterion : At least one lesion great equal 1.0 cm long diameter nonlymph node great equal 1.5 cm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord RECIST 1.1 use computerize tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( CT/MRI ) . If one target lesion nonlymph node , long diameter great equal 1.5 cm . Lesions external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) locoregional therapy radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation must show evidence progressive disease base RECIST 1.1 deem target lesion . 8 . Subjects brain metastasis eligible following condition : undergone complete surgical excision 1 month postsurgery radiographic evidence disease recurrence brain undergone stereotactic radio surgery ( gamma knife procedure radiotherapy ) 1 month post procedure radiographic evidence disease progression brain asymptomatic discontinue corticosteroid treatment and/or anticonvulsive therapy least 1 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 9 .

Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) great 50 % echocardiography multiplegated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan 13 . Females must lactate pregnant screen baseline ( document negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ BhCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit BhCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . Females childbearing potential must unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day prior study entry must agree use highly effective method contraception ( e.g. , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . If currently abstinent , subject must agree use doublebarrier method describe becomes sexually active study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . Females use hormonal contraceptive must stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week prior dose must continue use contraceptive study 30 day study drug discontinuation . 14 . Male subject must successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner must meet criterion ( i.e. , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception throughout study period 30 day study drug discontinuation ) . Subjects one following exclude study : 1 . Subjects melanoma intraocular origin 2 . Leptomeningeal metastasis brain metastasis except inclusion criterion number 8 3 . Subjects take medication either strong CYP inhibitor inducer 4 . Subjects active malignancy except wt BRAF Stage IV unresectable Stage III melanoma , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , adequately treated Stage I II cancer subject currently complete remission , cancer subject diseasefree 5 year 5 . Prior treatment PARP inhibitor 6 . Prior treatment dacarbazine ( DTIC ) TMZ contain regimen 7 . Subjects know allergy , hypersensitivity , contraindication E7016 , TMZ , DTIC component formulation 8 . Subjects know human immunodeficiency virus infection ( HIV ) , active hepatitis B C 9 . Subjects active infection require specific antiinfective therapy 10 . Subjects major surgical procedure ( include tumor resection ) within 4 week prior initiate E7016 treatment 11 . Subjects schedule surgery project course study 12 . Chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy within 4 week prior initiate E7016 treatment ( 6 week mitomycin C nitrosoureas ) investigational agent within 30 day prior first dose study drug recover ( Grade 0 1 ) acute toxicity relate previous anticancer treatment 13 .
