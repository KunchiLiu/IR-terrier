	<brief_summary>The discovery inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) circulate people develop sepsis pathology provide opportunity develop first-in-class diagnostic test onset sepsis . This study design determine normal human plasma level circulate iNOS initial reference level hospitalize patient risk development sepsis compare ascertain patient risk become septic base upon elevated level plasma iNOS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infections intensive care unit ( ICUs ) hospital setting cause different type organism , bacteria fungi . Yearly , infection cause least 2 million patient USA enter early stage sepsis pathology ( pre-sepsis ) lead 750,000 case sepsis deteriorate life-threatening severe sepsis organ dysfunction septic shock multiple organ failure result 250,000 death per year . At present , accurate clinical lab test predict onset sepsis pathology exist . Thus , large unmet clinical lab need test aid physicians assess risk hospitalize patient develop sepsis pathology . A reliable test predict early onset sepsis would major medical breakthrough . However , reference level normal healthy individual need plasma level compare increase ( decrease ) level iNOS .</detailed_description>
