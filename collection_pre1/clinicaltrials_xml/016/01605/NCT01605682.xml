There however debate regard mechanism drive health promoting property . Despite wide health promote property fruit extract report literature , considerable interest past decade primarily focus role reduce risk factor associate cancer heart disease . Consequently , remain paucity actual scientific information role modulate brain function , mood , learn memory , decrement negative impact quality life . A prior study carry first study PhD , attempt bridge gap knowledge find promising result acutely supplement participant fruit base drink . The finding show increase vigilance attention relate psychometric task increase feel calmness . The investigator hypothesise cognitive enhancing effect due monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibit effect fruit drink , ex vivo finding support 96 % reduction MAO-B activity . The aims current study threefold : extend finding previous investigation extend task explore ; ascertain positive result first study dose dependent ; investigate whether low dose facilitate great change behaviour .</brief_summary>
