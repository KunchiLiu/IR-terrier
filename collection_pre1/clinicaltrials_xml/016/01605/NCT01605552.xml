	<brief_summary>The objective clinical trial evaluate whether computerized depression treatment , deliver onset heart disease , reduce risk heart disease future . Participants trial primary care patient depress history heart disease . Half patient receive standard treatment ( usual care ) , half receive eight week evidence-based psychological treatment call Beating Blues® , computerize , cognitive behavioral treatment program depression . To evaluate change heart disease risk , investigator measure function artery use ultrasound treatment . It hypothesize patient receive Beating Blues® show great improvement depression artery function patient receive standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression independent risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ; unfortunately , past trial detect cardiovascular benefit . A promising unexplored explanation result intervention deliver late natural history CAD . Because study evaluate possibility , critical need determine whether evidence-based depression treatment , deliver onset clinical CAD , reduce cardiovascular risk . Accordingly , objective propose clinical translational research perform preliminary evaluation efficacy highly disseminable depression intervention decrease CAD risk . To achieve goal , clinical trial depress primary care patient free cardiovascular disease conduct . Patients randomize usual care computer-based , cognitive behavioral intervention call Beating Blues® , widely use empirically supported computerized treatment program depression . The primary outcome brachial artery flow-mediated dilation , noninvasive measure endothelial function . The specific aim propose trial evaluate whether Beating Blues® , deliver prior onset clinical CAD , improve endothelial dysfunction . Demonstrating earlier treatment depression Beating Blues lower CAD risk , long-term expect outcome , would place computed-based depression treatment armamentarium CAD prevention strategy primary care provider . This change clinical practice result improve cardiovascular risk management , turn would translate reduce CAD morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
