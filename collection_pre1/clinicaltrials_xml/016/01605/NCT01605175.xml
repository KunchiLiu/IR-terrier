	<brief_title>Predictors Mucosal Healing Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) Patients Treated With Anti-TNF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic idiopathic inflammatory condition gastrointestinal tract result considerably decrease quality life . Long term experience standard therapy inflammatory bowel disease patient late 1990s demonstrated diverse limitation . Corticosteroids good short term efficacy , suitable maintain remission , treatment immunomodulators associate important risk side effect . The introduction monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor ( TNFa ) therapy offer new treatment option originally patient Crohn 's disease recently ulcerative colitis well . Several clinician base result clinical trial , advocate early use intensive therapy ( immunosuppressant and/or biologics ) maintain good quality life first flare prevent irreversible consequence disease . Meanwhile , assessment tissue heal become paramount importance patient treat inflammatory bowel disease . Simple clinical assessment reflect real activity inflammation tissue level . Moreover , cumulative tissue damage generate persist tissue inflammation lead non reversible anatomic functional consequence . Therefore , order evaluate natural history impact treatment inflammatory bowel disease standardize assessment tissue heal must available . Endoscopic histological heal show associate reduce risk recurrence disease , addition reduce hospitalization surgery . Furthermore , patient treat costly highly immunosuppressive TNF-a antagonist , achievement objective treatment response essential . Consequently , endoscopic heal regard primary approach treatment inflammatory bowel disease . Although several clinical trial identify , diagnosis , factor predictive subsequent disable course disease , therefore identifying patient would mostly benefit early aggressive therapy anti-TNF , factor predictive mucosal heal yet identify . Endoscopy ( ileocolonoscopy ) perform baseline ( i.e . anti-TNF administration ) patient include study . The outcome anti-TNF therapy evaluate two follow endoscopy , 3 month 12 month start therapy . At time period disease activity document well . For Crohn 's disease patient , simplify endoscopic severity index record ( SES-CD ) , table 1 . According current guideline , mucosal heal define SES-CD low 5 point . For CD patient , CD activity index ( CDAI ) also determine . For ulcerative colitis , Mayo endoscopic subscore record ( 0 : normal mucosa , 1 : fade vascular pattern , mild friability , 2 : loss vascular pattern , erosion , friability , 3 : ulcer spontaneous bleed ) . According recent recommendation Food Drug Administration , mucosal heal define Mayo score 0 . Disease activity grade accord Clinical Activity Index ( Lichtiger 's CAI ) , high possible score 21 . For ulcerative colitis patient Montreal classification extent disease also assess . Laboratory data blood hemoglobin , hematocrit , white blood cell , plasma serum albumin C-reactive protein ( CRP ) collect patient baseline . Use concurrent medication record , especially dosage data corticosteroid immunosuppressant medication . Infliximab administer 5 mg/Kg body weight 0 , 2 6 week thereafter , every 2 month follow period 1 year . Adalimumab administer dose 160mg week 0 , 80 mg week 2 , 40 mg week 4 40 mg every week thereafter . The primary goal study identify predictor , baseline , mucosal heal patient ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease receive infliximab adalimumab control disease . For reason end follow period ( 12 month ) , follow variable test univariate analysis : Patient characteristic baseline - age - gender - age onset disease - duration disease - concomitant corticosteroid use start anti_TNF therapy - concomitant immunosuppressant use start anti-TNF therapy - Blood hemoglobin - Hematocrit - White blood cell - Serum albumin - C-reactive protein - Fecal calprotectin level - CDAI baseline CD patient - Lichtiger score baseline UC patient - Previous major abdominal surgery - Tobacco use - Indication anti-TNF therapy CD patient ( luminal CD , luminal fistulizing CD , luminal CD extra-intestinal manifestation ) - Location disease CD patient ( ileitis , colitis , ileocolitis ) - Location disease UC patient ( Montreal classification ) - Prior appendectomy In addition , immunological marker predictive value mucosal heal 1 year seek intestinal well systemic level . Investigators test marker baseline also week 12 . In way , investigator try identify pre-treatment predictor mucosal heal also early predictor response anti-TNF agent . For determination mucosal marker , endoscopy investigator collect 2 biopsy sample RNA-later . These sample store -80 C , use quantitative messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression various immunological marker , mainly cytokines receptor , adhesion molecule inflammatory protein real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . A third biopsy specimen immerse formalin maintain protein expression study immunohistochemistry . Biopsies collect overtly inflame normal-looking mucosa various location feasible . For determination systemic marker , blood collect patient serum separate stored -26 C. These sample use measurement soluble inflammatory marker may demonstrate predictive value achievement mucosal heal . Inflammatory marker may measure Multiplex assay individual ELISAs .</detailed_description>
