	<brief_summary>This study intend test hypothesis malaria antigen PfPEBS , manufacture synthetic protein adjuvanted aluminium hydroxide well-tolerated immunogenic ( Phase 1 ) , functionally active erythrocytic stage ( Phase 1 ) efficacious ( Phase 2 ) pre-erythrocytic stage protect artificial malaria challenge use Pf sporozoites healthy adult population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Malaria Vaccine Candidate , PfPEBS ( P. Falciparum Pre-Erythrocytic Blood Stage )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll 36 healthy adult subject ( 18-45 year ) randomize double-blind manner 3 arm 12 subject ; 2 arm receive either 5μg 30μg , adjuvanted aluminium hydroxide , give 2-dose schedule 28 day interval . The third arm 12 subject act control , receive aluminium hydroxide injection . If safety immunogenicity result permit , subject challenge live mosquito challenge deliver P falciparum sporozoites assess pre-erythrocytic vaccine efficacy . The PfPEBS molecule find vivo vitro functional activity two stage clinically significant malaria namely pre-erythrocytic stage ( sporozoite liver stage ) erythrocytic stage . The formulation simple combination synthetic protein 131 amino acid adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide , adjuvant wide safety record . The combined Phase 1/2a study design order achieve 3 co-primary objective 1 . Phase 1 : To demonstrate safety tolerability 2 . Phase 1 : To measure activity asexual blood stage parasite indirectly estimate functional activity elicit antibody ADCI in-vitro condition 3 . Phase 2 : To demonstrate efficacy liver stage measure proportion subject protect follow live sporozoite challenge . The mechanism defenses differ `` liver stage '' `` erythrocytic stage '' . Defenses `` liver stage '' strongly relate secretion interferon γ CD4+Th1 cell , whereas blood stage defence depend antibody . Preliminary study demonstrate low antigen dose 5 2μg produce strong CD4+Th1- interferon γ secrete cell low antibody titer , whereas high antigen dose 30 50μg induce low CD4 Th1 cell response markedly higher antibody response . Therefore choice two dose range Pf-PEBS clinical trial protocol aim test two main efficacy objective , one `` liver stage '' low dose , `` blood stage '' high dose . The Sponsor two Phases Vac4all . The funder Phase Ia EMVDA programme European Commission . The funder Phase IIa Vac4all</detailed_description>
