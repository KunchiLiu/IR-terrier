	<brief_summary>The primary objective prospective , descriptive study evaluate success rate retroclavicular brachial plexus block catheter placement 60 adult patient undergoing hand , wrist , forearm surgery . The investigator also evaluate difficulty perform procedure , onset time distribution block , incidence adverse event , patient 's acceptance block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Ultrasound-Guided Retroclavicular Brachial Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nerve block use anesthesiologist method pain control allow painless surgery limb , render general anesthetic surgery unnecessary . Local anesthetic medication inject needle next nerve , often use ultrasound machine visualize needle nerve simultaneously . A catheter , small plastic tube , insert next nerve order provide pain relief hour day surgery . The nerve provide sensation forearm , wrist hand radial , median , ulnar , musculocutaneous medial nerve forearm . These nerve originate network nerve fiber exit spinal cord level neck . They tightly bundle together , form brachial plexus , neck axilla , provide anesthesiologist many location perform nerve block . One block , know infraclavicular block , approach nerve beneath clavicle perform decade . This study aim examine new technique block brachial plexus , perform similar level infraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block . The ultrasound-guided retroclavicular brachial plexus block potential advantage easier perform , successful , less painful patient , good pathway catheter placement . It differ infraclavicular nerve block needle insert clavicle rather . In addition , allow anesthesiologist another approach brachial plexus , utilized patient infraclavicular block brachial plexus block due anatomical change , infection sight . The retroclavicular brachial plexus block first use two patient Brigham Women 's Hospital infraclavicular approach contraindicate due anatomical change surgery trauma . This procedure find reliable way perform brachial plexus nerve block become routine procedure Brigham Women 's Hospital hand forearm surgery past three year . In review literature , similar procedure introduce Hebbard Royse 2007 , patient data report . By assess procedure prospective study , investigator able describe technique , success rate complication literature allow anesthesiologist potentially incorporate block repertoire .</detailed_description>
