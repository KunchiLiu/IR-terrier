	<brief_title>Predictors Non-response Loss Response IBD Patients Treated With Anti-TNF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis chronic idiopathic inflammatory condition gastrointestinal tract result considerably decrease quality life . Long term experience standard therapy inflammatory bowel disease patient late 1990s demonstrated diverse limitation . Corticosteroids good short term efficacy , suitable maintain remission , treatment immunomodulators associate important risk side effect . The introduction monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor ( TNFa ) therapy offer new treatment option originally patient Crohn 's disease recently ulcerative colitis well . Several clinician base result clinical trial , advocate early use intensive therapy ( immunosuppressant and/or biologics ) maintain good quality life first flare prevent irreversible consequence disease . In 1998 infliximab first anti-TNF therapy approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment adult patient moderately severely active luminal fistulizing CD inadequate response conventional therapy . In 2007 adalimumab also approve treatment adult patient moderate severe CD . More recently , infliximab approve treatment ulcerative colitis patient . The current recommendation infliximab dose comprises induction 5 mg/kg 0 , 2 , 6 week , follow maintenance 5 mg/kg every 8 week . Adalimumab administer dose 160 mg initially follow 80 mg 2 week later dose 40 mg every week . Since aim administer anti-TNF therapy achieve disease remission , note clinical setting , remission define absence gut-related symptom , normal C-reactive protein ( CRP ) erythrocyte sedimentation ratio ( ESR ) , hemoglobin , albumin , platelet count . Clinical response define improvement symptom ( reduce bowel frequency , reduce urgency , improved stool consistency , reduce abdominal pain , reduce rectal bleeding , improve general well-being , increase energy , reduce lethargy ) improvement blood test parameter ( reduce CRP , ESR , platelet count , improve albumin hemoglobin ) . Despite high response rate , patient improve initiation anti-TNF therapy worsen initial response . In ACCENT I trial , 42 % patient primary lack response infliximab induction therapy , CHARM trial , 42 % patient primary non-response open label adalimumab induction therapy . According literature data , diminish complete loss initial response anti-TNF therapy occur time treatment begin occur 30-50 % patient treat . Regaining response achieve either reduce frequency infusion increase dose , whether sometimes increase dose plus reduction dose interval require . Primary non-response define lack response minimal , clinically insignificant response initiation biological agent . To define demonstrate primary non-response patient objective evidence active inflammation symptom relate IBD . There currently consensus long biological drug continue lack response declare , although 58 % patient demonstrate response infliximab within 2 week . A substantial proportion patient , however , demonstrate response 12 week commence treatment . Most responder demonstrate clinical response week 14 ( case infliximab usually include three induction plus one dose ) . With adalimumab induction therapy may require 12 week determine whether response achieve . Loss response define initial response biological drug follow diminish less durable response time . For CD patient , primary non-response define variously failure achieve define fall CDAI baseline , CDAI remain great 220 . Loss response define CDAI great 220 , correlate least mild disease activity . In patient primary non-response , loss response , anti-TNF drug , consideration give reassess disease activity exclude complication development stenosing disease , abscess , infection , include cytomegalovirus Clostridium difficile . Given morbidity associate inappropriate dosing high cost associate therapy biologic agent , determine predictor non-response loss response ( need dose escalation ) important clinical economic implication . However , exist paucity research examine factor . Endoscopy ( ileocolonoscopy ) perform baseline ( i.e . anti-TNF administration ) patient include study . For Crohn 's disease patient , simplify endoscopic severity index record ( SES-CD ) , table 1 , CD activity index ( CDAI ) also determine . For ulcerative colitis , Mayo endoscopic subscore record ( 0 : normal mucosa , 1 : fade vascular pattern , mild friability , 2 : loss vascular pattern , erosion , friability , 3 : ulcer spontaneous bleed ) . Disease activity grade accord Clinical Activity Index ( Lichtiger 's CAI ) , high possible score 21 . For ulcerative colitis patient Montreal classification extent disease also assess . Laboratory data blood hemoglobin , hematocrit , white blood cell , plasma serum albumin C-reactive protein collect patient baseline . Use concurrent medication record , especially dosage data corticosteroid immunosuppressant medication . Infliximab administer 5 mg/Kg body weight 0 , 2 6 week thereafter , every 2 month follow period 1 year . Adalimumab administer dose 160mg week 0 , 80mg week 2 , 40mg week 4 40mg every week thereafter . The outcome anti-TNF therapy evaluate every 2 month finally 12 month start therapy . At time period disease activity document well . For patient need dose escalation , type dose escalation , i.e . increase dose frequency ( every one month infliximab - every week adalimumab ) increase dosage ( 10mg/Kg body weight infliximab - 80mg adalimumab ) record . The time anti-TNF initiation till need dose escalation also record . The primary goal study identify predictor , baseline , anti-TNF non-response anti-TNF loss response , lead dose escalation patient ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease receive infliximab ( CD/UC ) adalimumab ( CD ) control disease . For reason end follow period ( 12 month ) , follow variable test univariate analysis : Patient characteristic baseline - age - gender - weight - height - age onset disease - duration disease initiation anti-TNF therapy - concomitant corticosteroid use start anti_TNF therapy - concomitant immunosuppresant use start anti-TNF therapy - Blood hemoglobin - Hematocrit - White blood cell - Serum albumin - C-reactive protein - ANA - Anti-ds DNA - Fecal calprotectin level - CDAI baseline CD patient - Lichtiger score baseline UC patient - Previous major abdominal surgery - Tobacco use - Indication anti-TNF therapy CD patient ( luminal CD , luminal fistulizing CD , luminal CD extraintestinal manifestation ) - Location disease CD patient ( ileitis , colitis , ileocolitis ) - Location disease UC patient ( Montreal classification ) - Prior appendectomy - Family history IBD In addition , immunological marker predictive value anti-TNF non-response loss response seek intestinal systemic level . For determination mucosal marker , 2 biopsy sample RNAlater collect endoscopy prior initiation anti-TNF therapy . Samples store -80oC use quantitative mRNA expression various immunological marker , mainly cytokines receptor , adhesion molecule inflammatory protein real time PCR . A third biopsy specimen immerse formalin maintain protein expression study immunohistochemistry . For determination systemic marker , blood collect patient serum separate stored -80oC . These sample use measurement soluble inflammatory marker may demonstrate predictive value anti-TNF non-response loss response . Inflammatory marker measure Multiplex assay individual ELISAs</detailed_description>
