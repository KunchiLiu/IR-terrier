	<brief_title>Postoperative Ibuprofen Risk Bleeding After Tonsillectomy With Without Adenoidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy one commonly perform surgical procedure pediatric population . The incidence adenotonsillectomy increase past four decade ( 1 ) . This mainly due increase awareness potential adverse consequence pediatric sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) may development long-term pulmonary cardiovascular health . SDB surpass recurrent tonsillitis common indication adenotonsillectomy child ( 2-5 ) . Over past decade , accord CDC 's National Health Statistic Report ambulatory surgery perform US , annual rate tonsillectomy perform without adenoidectomy child age 15 young increase 287,000 530,000 ( 6 , 7 ) . Adenotonsillectomy second common procedure perform child age 15 . Although generally consider safe procedure , adenotonsillectomy significant morbidity potential complication , particularly pediatric population . Complications include postoperative hemorrhage , dehydration , pain , anesthetic complication airway risk , aspiration , post-obstructive pulmonary edema ( 8 ) . In young child , risk adenotonsillectomy critical due small airway respiratory reserve , well small blood volume ( 5 ) . Postoperative bleed categorized primary event , occur &lt; 24 hour surgery , secondary event , occur &gt; 24 hour tonsillectomy . Additionally , event describe intervention take , emergency room visit , admission observation , return operate room achieve hemostasis . Postoperative bleeding rate , include primary secondary event , range 3.3-20 % , mean 4.5 % ( 9 ) . Thus , annually , ten thousand child experience exposure potentially life-threatening postoperative hemorrhage , often require readmission , anesthetic exposure , operative control hemorrhage . Postoperative pain contributes significantly post-tonsillectomy morbidity . While narcotic effective control postoperative pain , often contraindicate , particularly child sleep disordered breathing , potentially adverse side effect respiration central nervous system ( 10 ) . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDS ) , block prostaglandin-induced inflammation edema , attractive therapeutic option result respiratory central nervous system depression , therefore may reduce risk postoperative respiratory depression , nausea vomiting , excessive sedation urinary retention . NSAIDS show effective analgesic tonsillectomy ( 11,12 ) . However , mechanism action may also interfere platelet aggregation increase bleeding time , use balance concern increase risk postoperative hemorrhage . Aspirin , irreversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase , affect coagulation bleed 10 day , associate increase bleed rate tonsillectomy ( 13 ) . However , non-aspirin NSAIDs demonstrate reversible inhibition COX-1 COX-2 , therefore severe , prolonged effect bleed ( 14 ) . Ibuprofen , derivative propionic acid , widely use musculoskeletal pain , study use post-tonsillectomy analgesia limit . In 2011 , The American Academy Otolaryngology publish Clinical Practice Guidelines outline evidence-based selection perioperative management strategy tonsillectomy child . As part recommendation clinician educate caregiver importance postoperative pain management , Baugh et al advocate use ibuprofen postoperatively , state , `` ibuprofen use safely pain control surgery '' ( 15 ) , cite 2005 Cochrane Review NSAIDs post-tonsillectomy bleed support guideline ( 16 ) . The Cochrane Review recently add additional study analysis result remain similar . The recent Cochrane Review , publish 2010 , evaluate 15 randomized trial compare NSAIDs analgesic placebo , determine NSAID use significantly alter number perioperative bleeding episode , require require surgical intervention ; review distinguish primary secondary bleeding event ( 17 ) . Because post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage uncommon event , large number participant require provide adequate number event give significant result , therefore large sample size &gt; 1000 child Cochrane Review admirable . However , sample size adequate compare risk bleed individual NSAID . Additionally , NSAIDs give oral parenteral form , well preoperatively , intraoperatively postoperatively , duration postoperative analgesic use differ study . The surgical technique use uniform study well . It feel limitation , data sufficient broadly implement Academy 's recommendation ibuprofen safely use post-tonsillectomy analgesia without carefully control , prospective study . Although many study literature evaluate NSAID use tonsillectomy , randomized-prospective trial evaluate use ibuprofen , trial power adequately assess risk postoperative hemorrhage . Designing execute study specifically evaluate ibuprofen pediatric tonsillectomy rate post-operative hemorrhage require return operate room control important pediatric otolaryngology community , particularly give American Academy Otolaryngology 's recent clinical guideline . The result definitive study would possibly affect ten thousand child risk post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage every year . It would affect standard care well national international norm . Preliminary Studies : At Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary precedent administer ibuprofen child tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy . Despite American Academy Otolaryngology support use ibuprofen postoperative setting , pediatric otolaryngologist institution still hesitant administer ibuprofen postoperatively without additional study use . Within Department Pediatric Otolaryngology Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary precedent successful completion randomize , control trial involve adenotonsillectomy ( 19 , 20 ) . With principal investigator dedicate clinical research , well research nurse coordinator disposal , prospective , control clinical trial ibuprofen use tonsillectomy implement . Additionally , Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary calculate annual post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage rate , include percentage patient return emergency room evaluation possible post-operative bleeding , well percentage patient return operate room control bleed . Thus , precedent collect data postoperative bleeding event , well control bleed rate prospective study hemorrhage rate compare . The goal study determine postoperative ibuprofen affect rate post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage use non-inferiority trial design , intend show effect ibuprofen bad acetaminophen , serve control . This differ equivalence trial , aim demonstrate experimental control group differ specify amount . The equivalence margin set non-inferiority trial often small treatment difference placebo-controlled trial power , require large sample size . This address two issue current literature evaluate NSAID use tonsillectomy : inadequate sample size , unrealistic treatment difference , include 20 % difference bleed rate , require detect significant difference NSAID control group . Because trial design test non-inferiority , null hypothesis assume inferiority : rate hemorrhage require operative intervention patient treat postoperative ibuprofen tonsillectomy increase compare rate patient give acetaminophen .</detailed_description>
