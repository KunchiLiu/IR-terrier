	<brief_title>Trebananib Treating Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) , define complete response ( CR ) +partial response ( PR ) , patient advance , unresectable angiosarcoma treat trebananib ( AMG 386 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient advance , unresectable angiosarcoma treat AMG 386 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate ORR , PFS , OS : Baseline post-treatment change expression angiopoietin 2 ( Ang2 ) TEK tyrosine kinase , endothelial ( Tie2 ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; Serum level angiopoietin 1 ( Ang1 ) Ang2 ; Baseline post-treatment change phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase status TIE2 , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase Inhibitor ( MEK ) tumor tissue ; Mutational status VEGFR-2 amplification v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( avian ) ( MYC ) /fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 ( FLT4 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month 18 month .</detailed_description>
