	<brief_title>Evaluation Patient Retention Fingolimod v . Currently Approved Disease Modifying Therapy Patients With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>852 Patients relapse remit MS randomize 1:1 fingolimod approve first line DMTs . Patients must either treatment naive receive treatment one class treatment ( interferon beta preparation glatiramer acetate ) . Patients previously treat DMT randomize DMT arm may remain treatment study switch different class ( i.e. , previously treat glatiramer acetate switch interferon beta preparaption , previously treat interferon beta preparation swtich glatiramer acetate ) . Entry criterion screen include limited , age 18-65 , diagnosis RRMS , EDSS &lt; equal 6 , pregnant planning pregnancy woman childbearing potential willing use contraception throughout study . Exclusion criterion include limited - prior exposure fingolimod , history malignancy within 5 year , RRMS type MS , diseases immune system , active macular edema , systemic bacterial , viral fungal infection , patient without vaccine varicella zoster , receipt live attentuated vaccine within month screening , history various cardiac condition , presence certain ECG abnormality , rest heart rate &lt; 45 bpm , symptomatic bradycardia , recurrent syncope , severe untreated sleep apnea , severe pulmonary condition , various hepatic condition , certain neurologic disorder , pregnancy . Patients may switch treatment 3 month safety reason , 3 month safety , efficacy , tolerability convenience . Treatment switch study may study approve treatment irrespective prior treatment . Patients randomize fingolimod need 6 hour observation sign symptom bradycardia follow administration first dose . Extended observation overnight observation may necessary certain circumstance . Primary objective evaluate efficacy fingolimod assess patient retention treatment . Secondary objective compare reason discontinuation , adverse event , cognitive impairment , medication satisfaction change brain volume measure MRI . Exploratory objectives include annualized relapse rate , OCT , MRI evaluation , biomarkers patient report outcome measure .</detailed_description>
