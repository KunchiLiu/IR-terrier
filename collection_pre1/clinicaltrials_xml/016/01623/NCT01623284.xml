	<brief_summary>The study design determine whether clinical feature use biomarkers predict whether underlie Alzheimer 's pathology cause speech language base dementia . The primary hypothesis proportion patient test positive beta-amyloid deposition vary across different speech language base dementia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Speech language base dementia ( SLDs ) ( often refer primary progressive aphasia PPA ) neurodegenerative disease speech language impairment salient feature disease explain deficits activity daily live . Patients SLDs may poor grammar , prominent anomia , comprehension deficit , speech production articulation problem , difficulty repetition word sentence , word finding pause , combination feature . The SLDs divide different subtypes . Up 50 % patient SLDs go autopsy show Alzheimer type pathology beta-amyloid deposition observe ; rest pathology consistent frontotemporal lobar degeneration beta-amyloid deposition absent . Future disease modify treatment target beta-amyloid likely differ treatment target beta-amyloid . As consequence , biomarkers need differentiate patient SLDs without beta-amyloid deposition . Little research do identify biomarkers could differentiate patient SLDs without beta-amyloid , mainly gold standard identify presence beta-amyloid pathological examination , always occur , may occur 10 year onset . The recent development [ N-methyl-11C ] 2- ( 4'-methylaminophenyl ) -6-hydroxybenzothiazole also know 11C Pittsburgh Compound B PiB solution problem since PiB allow vivo detection beta-amyloid . Unfortunately , PiB expensive . The long term goal research develop cost effective algorithmic approach evaluation diagnosis patient present SLDs . The objective study outline proposal identify clinical , neuropsychological , image biomarkers readily available , relatively inexpensive , non-invasive allow differentiation patient SLDs without beta-amyloid deposition . We use PiB indicator beta-amyloid pathology . Our proposal predicate upon strong preliminary data show clinical , neuropsychological radiological feature differ patient SLDs without beta-amyloid deposition . Our central hypothesis temporo-parietal lobe finding memory loss , visuospatial/perceptual impairment , parietal lobe atrophy magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , parietal lobe hypometabolism [ 18-F ] -fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) , associate beta-amyloid deposition ( PiB positive status ) . On-the-other hand , frontal lobe feature , apraxia speech behavioral executive dysfunction , well extrapyramidal feature Parkinsonism , associate absence beta-amyloid deposition ( PiB negative status ) . The rationale examine clinical-imaging relationship successful prediction provide solid scientific foundation ultimate development cost effective algorithm guide diagnosis SLDs . Patients find eligible willing enroll study ask undergo Neurologic Examination , Speech Pathology Consultation , Neuropsychometric testing , MRI scan , FDG PET scan PiB PET scan brain .
