	<brief_title>MAS-1 Adjuvanted Compared Unadjuvanted Influenza Vaccines Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many VA patient at-risk complication influenza advanced age underlie chronic disease . A effective influenza virus vaccine need older patient population high antibody level correlate protection . Vaccine dose-sparing maximize number dose available public health goal . The combination influenza vaccine antigen adjuvant could help improve vaccine . This study phase 1 , 2 randomize , observer-blind , multi-center , clinical trial , patient age 65 year old , evaluate immunogenicity safety water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant ( MAS-1 ) combine three reduce influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) antigen dose level trivalent influenza virus vaccine compare unadjuvanted , standard dose trivalent influenza virus vaccine ( TIV ) . Immunogenicity three viral strain ( A/H1N1 , A/H3N2 , B virus ) concurrent seasonal influenza vaccine assess . The hypothesis adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine ( use reduce dos influenza HA antigen contain 1 g , 3 g 5 g HA ) superior immunogenicity compare unadjuvanted , standard dose trivalent influenza virus vaccine ( contain 15 g HA antigen ) three viral strain , adjuvanted vaccine acceptable safety profile . The primary objective demonstrate 1 ) acceptable safety influenza virus vaccine , adjuvanted MAS-1 compare unadjuvanted , standard dose TIV , 2 ) improve immunogenicity adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine compare unadjuvanted , standard dose TIV three viral strain . Immunogenicity measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer . The primary measure immunogenicity seroconversion rate 1 month post-vaccination viral strain . Secondary exploratory immunogenicity objective include seroprotection rate ( define proportion subject post-vaccination HAI antibody titer &gt; 1:40 viral strain ) 1 , 3 6 month post-vaccination viral strain ; geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) HAI antibody ratio GMTs pre-vaccination 1 , 3 6 month post-vaccination four vaccine group viral strain ; geometric mean fold increase ( GMFI ) 1 , 3 6 month post-vaccination compare pre-vaccination ( i.e. , GMT post-vaccination value divide GMT pre-vaccination value ) virus strain within four vaccine group . The study population 160 subject ( 40 per vaccine group ) provide inform consent meet eligibility criterion enrol four clinical site . Subjects meet entry criterion study randomly assign receive one three adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine dose level unadjuvanted , standard dose TIV . Randomization stratify clinical site ( 4 site ) age ( 65-74 year old 75 year old ) . Vaccine preparation perform point-of-use site pharmacist accord standardized procedure . Administration vaccine perform unblinded vaccine administrator . Study assessment perform blind study personnel . Subjects also blind treatment assignment . Study subject participate total 12 month post-vaccination . The whole study duration 32 - 32.5 month expect include 6 month startup , 8 - 10 week enrollment , 12 month follow-up post-vaccination 12 month study closure data analysis . If objective study achieve hypothesis correct , adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine one reduce HA antigen dos induce improve HAI antibody response compare unadjuvanted , standard dose TIV acceptable safety profile . Results trial inform design future clinical trial study adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine utilize novel water-in-oil adjuvant emulsion could include dose-finding study optimal amount adjuvant combine one HA antigen dose , large phase 2 3 clinical trial .</detailed_description>
