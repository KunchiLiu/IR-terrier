	<brief_title>Bone Loss Treatment From Adjuvant Zoledronate Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonly diagnose malignant disease lead cause cancer-related mortality among woman . Zoledronate bone-targeted bisphosphonate , use treat osteoporosis reduce risk skeletal morbidity patient bone metastasis . Zoledronate also reduce persistence disseminate tumour cell bone marrow woman early-stage breast cancer . Nowadays , consensus emerge certain subset patient early-stage breast cancer may benefit bisphosphonate therapy .</detailed_description>
