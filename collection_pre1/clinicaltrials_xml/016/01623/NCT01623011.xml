	<brief_summary>Shoulder problem cause pain decreased function common . Many problem related rotator cuff tendon . Shoulder arthroscopy surgery ( keyhole surgery ) common treatment pain . This involve Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression ( ASAD ) operation use remove bony spur may cause pain . This procedure widely use despite limited evidence effectiveness . This randomise controlled trial compare ASAD investigational shoulder arthroscopy ( without spur removal/decompression ) indicate whether spur removal really necessary turn , assess effectiveness ASAD procedure . Both surgical intervention routine mirror except spur removal element . Both treatment compare control ( non operative management specialist reassessment ) group indicate whether surgery general effective patient subacromial pain . Patients randomise either surgical option blind type surgery . This multicentre trial take place 10 centre England Wales . Two satellite study also take place . One involve subset patient undergo MRI scan examine effect shoulder pain brain transmission . The involve collect tissue sample patient undergo surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence shoulder complaint UK estimate 14 % , 1-2 % adult consult general practitioner annually regard new-onset shoulder pain . Rotator cuff pathology , include rotator cuff tear sub-acromial pain , reportedly account 70 % shoulder pain problem . Other common cause shoulder pain include frozen shoulder , calcific tendonitis osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Painful shoulder pose substantial socioeconomic burden . Disability shoulder impair ability work perform household task result time work . Shoulder problem account 2.4 % general practitioner consultation UK 4.5 million visit physician annually USA . With exception fracture traumatic rotator cuff tear , shoulder pain problem treat initially conservative care . In patient persistent symptom , surgery might require . More 300,000 surgical repair rotator cuff pathology perform annually USA , annual financial burden shoulder pain management USA estimate US $ 3 billion . Sub-acromial pain frequent cause shoulder problem general population . An anatomical etiology propose , whereby mechanical contact occur rotator cuff tendon overlie acromion coracohumeral ligament . Sub-acromial pain rotator cuff tear associate progressive change shape acromion , 'spurs ' form antero-inferior margin . Evidence suggest spur develop narrow sub-acromial space , thereby make physical contact likely , particularly certain position arm ( example , painful arc ) , result inflammation . This sometimes refer `` impingement '' . However term suggest definitive mechanism pain conflict theory indicate mechanism definitive . For purpose study continue refer `` sub-acromial pain '' . A high proportion patient sub-acromial pain respond conservative treatment . The frequent indication surgery persistent severe pain combine functional restriction resistant conservative measure . Despite surgery consider point , report show surgery effective physiotherapy relief pain use patient stage . Surgical intervention , however , achieve good result judicious use seem valid . The common surgical intervention sub-acromial pain sub-acromial decompression ( SAD ) , perform arthroscopic ( ASAD ) approach . An assessment cost treatment impingement also suggest addition surgery , comparison exercise treatment alone , cost-effective . Further research might identify whether source pain tendon , acromion bursa , hence help rationalize surgical treatment . One possible sequela sub-acromial pain rotator cuff tear . The term 'rotator cuff tear ' refers structural failure tissue disruption least one four muscle tendon form rotator cuff . Any tear involves rotator cuff disruption extend way tendon term partial-thickness tear ( PTT ) . PTTs prevalent full-thickness tear . Information lack regard risk progression PTTs full-thickness tear although thought lesion involve less 50 % thickness cuff risk progression long term show Cordasco et al . The management PTTs controversial patient PTTs commonly treat conservatively . If symptoms fail resolve conservative treatment ASAD might beneficial . Favourable result report following debridement PTT association ASAD . It largely assume arthroscopic sub-acromial decompression ( ASAD ) therapeutic benefit . This assumption much pain symptom sub-acromial pain due mechanical contact upper surface rotator cuff tendon under-surface acromion . This pain also believe associated inflammation intervene sub-acromial bursa . ASAD perform treatment sub-acromial pain rotator cuff disease last 35 year . The number ASADs perform orthopaedic surgeon increase significantly time . A fact make remarkable absence compel concrete evidence support procedure . Recent figure USA report 254 % increase ( 29.9 102.2 per 100 000 people per year ) use procedure New York State 1996 2006 74 % increase orthopaedic surgery overall 475 % increase ( 3.3 19.0 per 100 000 people per year ) use procedure Olmsted County , Minnesota 25 year leading 2005 . Although study show significant increase use procedure , New York State surgeon perform five time many decompression colleague Rochester Minnesota . The introduction less invasive arthroscopic technique account overall increased rate surgery explain geographical variation . Patient disease characteristic change time grow concern procedure overuse . Observational study ASAD show positive result term pain reduction functional outcome high patient satisfaction rate . However , equally good outcome note two study follow patient arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement open rotator cuff repair absence sub-acromial decompression . Furthermore , comparative study ASAD versus non-operative treatment option , physiotherapy , show significant difference outcome two treatment modality . There grow number study try assess effectiveness sub-acromial decompression control . Two study randomise patient undergo rotator cuff repair group include exclude sub-acromial decompression operative treatment , neither demonstrate difference outcome group . In important recently report randomised controlled trial , ASAD plus sub-acromial bursectomy compare bursectomy alone report significant difference clinical outcome two group . This finding suggest remove acromial spur might necessary . These study support theory undergoing surgical intervention sub-acromial pain carry significant placebo effect removal sub-acromial spur bone may necessary . Unfortunately randomised trial perform patient sub-acromial pain show ASAD effective simply insert arthroscope , per investigative arthroscopy , nothing ( treatment ) . The NHS Database Uncertainties Effects Treatment ( DUETs ) confirm lack evidence . They highlight low level evidence available high susceptibility bias exist publication topic . Therefore , remain ignorant mode action potential therapeutic effect . All three option yet test satisfactorily . To unequivocally state surgery treatment effective , surgical procedure must compare sham placebo treatment . A sham surgery must mock imitation procedure . It virtually impossible imitate operation without actually perform surgery . In term placebo , previous placebo control trial surgery , particularly low limb , interesting result . It known process undergo surgery ( without necessarily affect structure involve pathology ) generate beneficial outcome . This show knee placebo control trial arthroscopic surgery osteoarthritis knee . This found , despite early benefit , one year result arthroscopic lavage debridement well entirely placebo operative procedure . Psychological mechanism treatment meaningful therapeutic effect . These may include expectation , memory , motivation , somatic focus , reward , anxiety reduction meaning . Expectancy require patient expectation future response treatment . Arguably surgery , attendant verbal non-verbal clue , powerful modulator expectancy could therefore profound placebo effect . Responses may also condition mediate physiological change hormone immune response . Most research neurobiology placebo investigate analgesia . Shoulder arthroscopy sub-acromial decompression principally ( entirely ) focus relief pain patient undergo relatively low risk day case surgical procedure may well affect form placebo effect . Analgesic response placebo often involve endogenous opioid mechanism . Other neuro-transmitters neuromodulators may also involve . To consider effect placebo potential , surgical procedure question key mechanical element ( ) operation isolate omit . In way therapeutic mechanism surgery evaluate perceived non-specific effect surgery highlight .</detailed_description>
