	<brief_summary>An arteriovenous fistula graft access ( AVF/AVG ) dialysis often consider superior option delivery dialysis , require needle insert . Patients dialysis indicate fear needle reason switch long-term central venous catheter ( CVC ) access fistula graft access otherwise meet eligibility criterial ask participate . Patients receive either standard enhance intervention address fear needle . The enhanced intervention include standard intervention plus video training Synera try actual patch .

	<detailed_description>Patients long-term CVCs ( &gt; 180 day ) recruit study participation ask `` Why n't get graft fistula ? '' Those indicate fear discomfort needle top 3 reason consent study administer AVF/AVG Stages Change Questionnaire . The Stages Change questionnaire use extensively research show highly predictive people engage behavior interest . The five stage change include : 1 ) Precontemplation : Patient n't know , know n't want think , behavior change ; 2 ) Contemplation : Patients know begin consider behavior change ; 3 ) Planning : Patient actively investigate make plan behavior change ; 4 ) Action : Patient commit make change and/or take concrete step change behavior ; 5 ) Maintenance : Patient make behavior change try maintain change . Patients cluster-randomized receive standard needle phobia intervention ( n = 32 ) , enhance intervention consist standard intervention plus demonstration Synera patch ( n = 32 ) within 15 day baseline . The intervention administer study team member . In clinic 1 patient randomize group , intervention administer multiple patient simultaneously . The standard intervention last approximately 20 30 minute . During time , patient receive information advantage arteriovenous fistula graft central-venous catheter , taught basic relaxation breathing , see brief video patient overcome needle fear , opportunity safely interact cannulation needle . In enhanced intervention , patient receive standard intervention 2 enhancement : ( 1 ) video include segment patient experience analgesic effect Synera patch ( 2 ) Synera patch apply begin intervention , 30 minute later patient give chance explore analgesic effect Synera . Patients complete Stages Change questionnaire 1 week intervention . Patients follow 4 month determine whether schedule vein map appointment fistula graft access place .</detailed_description>
