	<brief_summary>This study aim assess safety effectiveness four new candidate malaria vaccine ; ChAd63 CS , ChAd63 ME-TRAP , MVA CS &amp; MVA ME-TRAP . These vaccine consist virus ( ChAd63 MVA ) genetically modify ( ) replicate human ( ii ) include part malaria parasite ; Plasmodium falciparum ( CS ME-TRAP ) . The hope vaccine induce immune response vaccinee able prevent malaria . This propose study compare effective ChAd63-MVA CS prevent malaria infection UK volunteer follow malaria challenge compare ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP . The study conduct University Oxford 's Centre Clinical Vaccinology Tropical Medicine ( CCVTM ) , Oxford , UK Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Southampton , UK . The malaria challenge take place insectary Imperial College ( Infection Immunity Section ) London , UK .</brief_summary>

For volunteer live Oxford : agreement stay hotel room close trial centre part study ( least day 6.5 post mosquito bite antimalarial treatment complete ) . Answer question inform consent quiz correctly . History clinical malaria ( specie ) . Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month significant risk malaria exposure . Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day CHMI ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( e.g . egg product , Kathon ) malaria infection . Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . History clinically significant contact dermatitis . History sickle cell anaemia , sickle cell trait , thalassemia thalassemia trait haematological condition could affect susceptibility malaria infection . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Contraindications use three propose antimalarial medication ; Malarone , Riamet Chloroquine .
