	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational combination use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve either drug combination test use patient , include people type cancer . BKM120 , BYL719 olaparib drug may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . These drug combine laboratory experiment animal , demonstrate anti-cancer activity . Information research study suggest follow agent BKM120 , BYL719 olaparib , may help shrink tumor cell type cancer study research study . In research study , investigator look high dose give safely also see combination BKM120 BYL719 olaparib effective treat type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During study , additional test perform sample original tumor store institution tissue bank . These test perform tumor tissue sample previous biopsy surgery cancer . The research do sample involve look DNA proteins cancer see researcher learn type cancer understand combination drug might work tumor . Testing sample require undergo additional research procedure . Approximately 2 tablespoon blood collect research test . This test involve look DNA protein blood compare see cancer . This drawn begin take study drug . You may also participate optional blood test BRCA gene . The BRCA gene test blood test use DNA analysis see change either one two breast cancer gene , know BRCA1 BRCA2 . After BRCA gene test perform , learn whether carry inherit BRCA gene mutation . If blood test BRCA gene , result report study doctor share result provide information relate personal risk breast cancer . Having BRCA gene mutation rare , occur 1 1000 people . Inherited BRCA gene mutation responsible less 5 10 percent breast cancer 10 15 percent ovarian cancer . Participants dose expansion portion study may ask tumor biopsy do . The dose expansion phase combination BKM120 Olaparib determine . The combination BYL719 Olaparib currently dose escalation phase dose expansion phase determine . Before begin take BKM120 ( BYL719 ) olaparib , doctor may also ask participate optional study would tumor biopsy do . Participation tumor biopsy blood test BRCA gene optional , whether consent refuse undergo additional test affect participation main research study . Since investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant high grade serious ovarian cancer triple negative breast cancer , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . All drug oral form . If take part research study , give study dose calendar drug treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 4 week . BKM120 BYL719 take daily morning , one hour light meal . Olaparib take twice day continuously , twelve hour apart . The olaparib morning dose take time BKM120 BYL719 one hour light meal . The evening dose also take one hour light meal empty stomach either 1 hour 2 hour meal . If vomit either medication , record diary take another dose day . The investigator assess tumor CT MRI scan every 8 week . During Cycle 1 , come clinic every week , cycle 2 , come clinic every 2 week . For cycle thereafter , come every 4 week . During study visit undergo follow : evaluation performance status , record healthy problem , physical exam include vital sign , list medication take since last visit , questionnaire evaluate anxiety depression , routine blood test , research blood test , Electrocardiogram optional biopsy . You remain research study long benefit study treatment . If remove research study reason may follow one year .</detailed_description>
