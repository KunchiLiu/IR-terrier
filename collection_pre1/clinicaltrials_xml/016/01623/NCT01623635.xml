	<detailed_description>Introduction : Laparoscopic surgery replace open surgical technique large number abdominal general surgical gynecologic intervention . However pain follow laparoscopic surgery continue clinically important problem 80 % patient require opioid analgesia post-operatively control pain . Post-operative pain lesser extent post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) main factor lead delayed discharge surgical recovery room hospital follow surgical case . Hence , post-operative pain PONV lead increase cost care . By reduce surgical complication patient discharge recovery room rapidly lead reduce resource utilization expense . This especially true routine surgical case ( laparoscopic cholecystectomy -gallbladder removal , gynecologic procedure , gastric surgery ) potential day surgery discharge home pain adequately treat . It also apply inpatient case superior pain control less PONV require less nursing care potentially earlier discharge . The origin pain laparoscopic surgery multifactorial pain arise incision site , direct trauma area surgical dissection , peritoneal micro-tears inflammation due stretch insufflation peritoneal diaphragm irritation residual CO2 remain pneumoperitoneum deflate . Because pain multifactorial - multifactorial approach need . Although somatic pain associate abdominal wall incision respond well nerve block opiate medication , visceral pain due pneumoperitoneum induce stretching , compression , oxygen deprivation inflammation surgery less responsive intervention . However , visceral pain treat topical anesthetic spray directly onto nerve ending visceral peritoneal line diaphragm surface . This knowledge result extensive research study effect apply topical anesthetic peritoneal surface laparoscopic surgery effort reduce post-operative pain attendant complication . Fairly clear conclusion draw review research investigate topical anesthetic application peritoneum , diaphragms surgical site : effectively reduce postoperative pain opioid use . They adverse effect systemically administer opioids sedation , respiratory depression , nausea , GI dysmotility . They safe relatively inexpensive . Their use result earlier progression ambulation , less shoulder tip pain , less post-operative nausea vomiting , early discharge recovery room study earlier discharge hospital . Despite research international recommendation use therapy topical anesthetic application laparoscopic surgery routinely use general obstetrical surgeon . There probably two inter-related reason lack adoption simple concept . First , simple method exists deliver topical anesthetic peritoneal surface . Most study dilute drug large volume saline ( make less potent less likely work ) , injected trocar gravity take solution straight gravity dependent gutter . This type delivery system would expect optimize result topically active medication since majority peritoneal surface never expose anesthetic . Secondly , pain reduction report topical anesthetic study positive impressive enough surgeon change practice . This marginal reduction post-operative pain probably due poor delivery system non-directed application drug great variation drug concentration , site delivery , time application . Studies use direct spray seem show well result . A 2010 metaanalysis conclude future study design determine topical intraperitoneal local anesthesia effective ( already proven ) , rather research focus optimization method delivery ( aerosolize ) , location application , time drug delivery , drug dose concentration . This study design address issue . The investigator use topical anesthetic ( namely 0.25 % ropivacaine ) deliver directly onto target site begin end surgery . The drug deliver use inexpensive delivery system direct fine mist drug directly area peritoneal cavity theoretically cause post-op pain ( diaphragm , peritoneal abdominal surface , surgical dissection site ) . Our primary goal ass efficacy intraperitoneal topical anesthesia reduce postoperative pain , opioid requirement patient undergo laparoscopic gynecologic laparoscopic procedure uterus adnexal benign pathology . Materials Methods : Design : Prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control trial stratify pathology ( uterus adnexal benign ) . Clinicaltrials.gov submission : This study design submit clinicaltrials.gov prospective trial registry require many journal . Patients : Women schedule elective gynecologic laparoscopic procedure uterus adnexal benign pathology Intervention : Patients randomize ropivicaine 0.25 % 40 ml ( 100 mg ) placebo ( NaCl 0.9 % ) accord randomization list stratify pathology deliver following fashion : - derma portal site inject 2 ml medication onset surgery ( total volume 6 ml ) . - follow insufflation abdomen , half remain ropivacaine atomize onto subdiaphragmatic area ( 3.5ml + 3.5ml ) , onto surgical dissection site ( 3 ml ) diffusely across peritoneal surface ( dome abdomen surface visible bowel ) ( 7ml ) . At end case remain medication atomize onto area , use volume . Primary Outcome Measured : 1 . Post-operative pain intensity ( NRS score . NRS ; 0 = pain 10 = bad pain possible ) 6h post-operatively . Secondary Outcomes measure 1 . Total post-operative opioid analgesic requirement first 48 hour post-operatively discharge 2 . Post-operative rescue opioid analgesic requirement first 6h post-operatively 3 . Post-operative pain intensity score first 48 hour post-operatively discharge - measure time 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 hour 4 . Post-operative shoulder pain ( NRS score . NRS ; 0 = pain 10 = bad pain possible ) intensity score first 48 hour post-operatively discharge - measure time 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 hour 5 . Post-operative nausea vomit verbal description score ( 0 = symptom , 1 = nausea , 2 = nausea vomit ) - measure time 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 hour 6 . Post-operative sedation score ( Sedation evaluate use 6 point Ramsay sedation score : 1= anxious agitate , 2 = cooperative , tranquil , orient , 3 = responds verbal command , 4 = asleep brisk response light stimulation , 5 = asleep without response light stimulation , 6 = non-responsive ) measure time 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 hour 7 . Time discharge recovery room 8 . Time discharge hospital 9 . Time first flatus bowel movement 10 . Time ambulation . Study Drug : Study drug : ropivacaine 0.25 % ( 2,5 mg/ml - 100 mg total ) local anesthetic manufacture Astra Zeneca ( Basiglio , MI , Italy ) .

Potentially eligible patient screen consented time pre-operative surgical evaluation ( night prior morning surgery ) . 2 . A standard anesthetic procedure conduct patient . - Pre-medication midazolam 0.03mg/kg I.V . - Induction propofol 2 mg/kg . Maintenance propofol 6mg/kg/h I.V . - Muscle relaxation cisatracurium , reversal neostigmine atropine - Intra-operative analgesia standardize administered anesthesiologist patient : - Fentanyl 2mcg/kg I.V . induction , 2mcg/kg 5 min surgical incision 2mcg/kg 30 minute prior end surgery - Remifentanil 0.1-0.3 mcg/kg/min I.V . - Acetaminophen 1g I.V . Ketoprofen 100 mg I.V . administer 30 minute prior end surgery 4 . A standard intra-operative antiemetic ( Ondansetron 4 mg I.V . ) administer anesthesia 15 minute prior end surgery . 5 . All laparoscopy perform standardized fashion 1 . Pneumoperitoneum open technique ( insufflation pressure 20 mmHg ) 2 . Insertion 3 trocars 3 . Intraabdominal pressure maintain 12 mmHg 4 . Uterine ovarian surgical procedure standardize fashion 6 . All study drug delivery perform standardized fashion . All port site inject 2 ml/each study drug prior trocar insertion b . Immediately follow insufflation Optispray surgical spray device insert abdomen direct towards diaphragm , dome inflate abdomen , bowel peritoneum surgical dissection site study drug deliver atomized spray follow volume : - subdiaphragmatic area 3.5 ml + 3.5ml - surgical dissection site 3 ml - diffusely across peritoneal surface ( dome abdomen surface visible bowel ) 7 ml . At end case remain medication atomize onto area , use volume . c. At end case - process repeat remain drug ( repeat port site injection ) . 7 . Postoperative analgesic : - patient receive Acetaminophen 1g I.V . 6h surgery , acetaminophen 1g per o every 8h - rescue analgesic Tramadol 100mg 50 ml 0.9 % saline I.V. , precede I.V . 0.01mg/kg droperidol . 8 . Rescue post-operative antiemetic : - ondansetron 4mg I.V . ( Maximal 3 times/day ) Data Collection procedure Data collect investigator store Dipartimento di Scienze Ginecologiche e della Riproduzione Umana . Electronic datasets prepare include anonymous data . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS v.18 computer program ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Risks patient : The risk patient study risk local anesthetic toxicity . The toxicity local anesthetic include seizure ventricular arrhythmia . At currently select dos low probability follow reason : dos select toxic dos describe package insert injected ropivacaine , yet dose injected rather spray onto peritoneal surface . While question drug absorb , occur time peak level achieve expect drug inject I.V.. Finally , prior literature study use similar dos describe toxicity patient toxic serum concentration apply peritoneal surface . Benefits patient This procedure already proven reduce postoperative pain numerous study routinely use . Therefore , patient 50 % probability deliver active anesthetic drug reasonably expect less pain arm study . Furthermore , reduce pain use few opiate may less nausea may discharge recovery room possible hospital rapidly . Statistical Analysis The investigator examine separately uterine surgical procedure adnexal surgical procedure . Sample size determination : Pain reduction : The study intention show CLINICALLY significant reduction pain ( statistically significant ) . This hard define relatively low baseline pain , patient anything minor laparoscopic surgery study past wake pain score 4-6 range - 6 typical . A pain score reduction 1.5 would 25 % pain reduction ( investigator know prior study 1.3 23 % reduction low limit clinically significant pain reduction ) . A sample size 45 group ( treatment v control ) 80 % power detect difference mean 1.500 ( difference Group 1 mean 6.000 Group 2 mean 4.500 ) assume common standard deviation 2.500 use two group t-test 0.050 two-sided significance level . Due potential drop-outs , investigator include 50 patient group , total 200 patient ( 100 undergo uterine procedure 100 undergo adnexal procedure ) . Statistical analysis perform appropriate .</detailed_description>
