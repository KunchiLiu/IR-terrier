	<brief_title>Effect Hypertonic Sodium Chloride Urinary Biomarkers Healthy Subjects Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fractional sodium excretion elevate high 10-20 % In patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) Changes sodium intake result slow expansion and/or reduction extracellular fluid CKD patient . Urinary biomarkers reflect kidney transport sodium water nephron . Changes sodium-and water channel activity induce intervention hypertonic Saline ( 3.0 % ) The change sodium-and water channel activity follow change extracellular intracellular fluid compartment plasma concentration vasoactive hormone . The purpose study investigate change urinary biomarkers ( u-NKCC2 , u-ENaC-gamma u-AQP2 ) , activity sodium-and water channel , extra- intracellular fluid compartment plasma concentration Vasoactive hormones patient CKD healthy subject . Subjects patient examine one examination day . Four day prior examination day subject consume standardize diet base amount sodium calorie . On examination day subject receive infusion hypertonic saline . Renal function measure renal clearance 51Cr-EDTA . Urinary biomarkers ( u-NKCC2 , u-ENaC-gamma u-AQP2 ) measure evaluate activity sodium channel nephron change fluid compartment measure body composition monitor .</detailed_description>
