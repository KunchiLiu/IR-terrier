	<brief_summary>Background : - Severe aplastic anemia rare serious blood disorder . It happen immune system start attack bone marrow cell . This cause bone marrow stop making red blood cell , platelet , white blood cell . Standard treatment disease horse-ATG cyclosporine , suppress immune system stop attack bone marrow . However , treatment work people . Some people still poor blood cell count even treatment . - Eltrombopag drug design mimic protein body call thrombopoietin . It help body make platelet . It may also cause body make red white blood cell . Studies show eltrombopag may useful added standard treatment severe aplastic anemia . It may help improve poor blood cell count . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness add eltrombopag standard immunosuppressive therapy severe aplastic anemia . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age severe aplastic anemia yet treat . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants start treatment horse-ATG cyclosporine . Treatment give accord standard care disease . - Cohort 1 : After 14 day , participant start take eltrombopag . They take eltrombopag 6 month . - Cohort 2 : After 14 day , participant start take eltrombopag . They take eltrombopag 3 month . - Cohort 3 Extension Cohort : Participants start take eltrombopag Day 1 . They take eltrombopag 6 month . - Participants may receive medication prevent infection treatment . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test . Participants also fill questionnaire symptom quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eltrombopag With Standard Immunosuppression Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterize pancytopenia hypocellular bone marrow . Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offer opportunity cure young patient , suitable candidate transplantation due advance age lack histocompatible donor . Comparable long-term survival SAA attainable immunosuppressive treatment horse anti-thymocyte globulin ( h-ATG ) cyclosporine ( CsA ) . However , patient treat h-ATG/CsA , one quarter one third respond , 30-40 % responder relapse . The majority hematologic response observe follow initial h-ATG/CsA partial , patient achieve normal blood count . Furthermore , analysis extensive clinical data suggest poor blood count response single course ATG ( non-robust responder ) , even transfusion-independence achieve , predict bad prognosis robust hematologic improvement achieve ( protocol 90-H-0146 ) . The explanation partial recovery relapse fully understood , incomplete elimination auto-reactive T cell insufficient stem cell reserve possible . Furthermore , 10-15 % SAA patient treat standard immunosuppression develop abnormal karyotype follow-up , monosomy 7 common , portends progression myelodysplasia leukemia . In contrast , malignant clonal evolution rare complete responder immunosuppression . Although horse ATG/CsA represent major advance treatment SAA , refractoriness , incomplete response , relapse , clonal evolution limit success modality . Thus , new regimen need address limitation , provide well alternative stem cell transplantation . One approach augment quality hematologic response improve underlie stem cell function . Previous attempt improve response SAA hematopoietic cytokine include erythropoietin , G-CSF , stem cell factor , fail . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) principal endogenous regulator platelet production . In addition , TPO also stimulatory effect primitive multilineage progenitor stem cell vitro animal model . Eltrombopag ( Promacta ) , oral 2nd generation small molecule TPO-agonist , currently approve treatment chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) , chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia , severe aplastic anemia insufficient response immunosuppressive therapy . Eltrombopag increase platelet healthy subject thrombocytopenic patient chronic ITP hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Our Branch recently complete pilot study eltrombopag refractory SAA . We saw encouraging clinical result cohort patient fail average two prior immunosuppressive regimen ( Olnes et al . ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts , San Diego , CA , 2011 , oral presentation N Engl J Med 2012 ; 367:11-9.1 ) . Of twenty-five SAA patient treat eltrombopag mouth three month , eleven ( 44 % ) patient meet protocol criterion clinically meaningful hematologic response , without significant toxicity . Nine patient demonstrate improvement thrombocytopenia ( &gt; 20k/ L increase transfusion independence ) , hemoglobin improve two patient ( &gt; 1.5g/dL achieve transfusion independence , four patient significant response neutrophil count . When responder continue drug beyond three month , hematologic response eltrombopag increase ; trilineage response observe four patient , bilineage response occur another four , median follow-up 13 month . These result suggest stem cell depletion , major component pathophysiology SAA , might directly address eltrombopag administration . The aim current study would improve hematologic response rate quality , well prevent late complication relapse clonal progression , addition eltrombopag standard immunosuppressive therapy . This trial evaluate safety efficacy combine eltrombopag standard hATG/CSA first line therapy patient SAA . The primary endpoint rate complete hematologic response six month . Secondary endpoint relapse , robust hematologic blood count recovery 3 , 6 , 12 month , survival , clonal evolution myelodysplasia leukemia , marrow stem cell content hematological response relapse patient re-start treatment .</detailed_description>
