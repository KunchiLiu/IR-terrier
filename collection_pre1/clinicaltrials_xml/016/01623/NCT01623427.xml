	<brief_title>The AVATAR Trial : Applying VAcuum To Accomplish Reduced Wound Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AVATAR Trial : Protocol Applying VAcuum To Accomplish Reduced wound infection laparoscopic pediatric surgery Surgical Site Infections ( SSIs ) common complication surgery worldwide one lead cause morbidity mortality surgical patient . Literature show patient develop SSI five time likely require readmission hospital within 30 day , 60 % likely require ICU admission , twice likely die . SSIs also carry significant financial burden healthcare system . Annually US , SSIs account 900 million dollar spend in-hospital $ 1.6 billion overall health care . The average risk develop SSI surgical procedure 1-4 % . A landmark study Horan , et al . 1992 define SSIs infection occur within 30 day operation 1 year implant device use . Infections classify : superficial incisional , deep incisional , organ/space , diagnostic criterion physical exam support category . This criterion SSI diagnosis since become standard definition American Center Disease Control ( CDC ) worldwide . Table 1 : CDC Definition SSI . Superficial Incisional SSI : - Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure AND - Involves skin subcutaneous tissue incision AND - Patient least 1 follow : - Purulent drainage superficial incision - Organisms isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid tissue superficial incision - At least one follow sign symptom : pain tenderness ; localize swelling , redness , heat ; superficial incision open surgeon culture-positive culture . A culture negative finding meet criterion . - Diagnosis superficial incisional SSI surgeon Deep Incisional SSI : - Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure implant OR within 1 year implant use AND infection appear related operative procedure AND - Involves deep soft tissue ( eg . fascial muscle layer ) incision AND - Patients least one following : - Purulent drainage deep incision organ/space component surgical site - A deep incision spontaneously dehisce deliberately open surgeon culture positive culture patient least one follow sign symptom : fever &gt; 38 degree Celsius localize pain tenderness . A culture negative meet criterion . - An abscess evidence infection involve deep incision find direct examination , reoperation , histopathologic radiologic examination . - Diagnosis deep incisional SSI surgeon Organ/Space SSI : - Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure implant use OR within 1 year implant use AND infection appear related operative procedure AND - Infection involve part body ( exclude skin incision , fascia , muscle layer ) open manipulate operative procedure AND - Patient least 1 follow : - Purulent drainage drain place stab wound organ/space - Organisms isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid tissue organ / space - An abscess evidence infection involve organ / space find direct examination , reoperation , histopathologic radiologic examination - Diagnosis organ/space infection surgeon Significant research undertaken determine risk factor , prevention , treatment SSIs . Risk factor generally divide procedure- patient-specific risk . Horan , et al . group procedure 4 wound classification : clean , clean-contaminated , contaminate , dirty . They find clean operation carry average risk 1 % dirty surgery carry risk &gt; 27 % . Other procedure-specific risk factor identify include : length procedure , degree hemostasis , tissue trauma , use drain . Patient-specific risk factor include : age , smoking , obesity , diabetes , poor nutrition , compromise immune system . While large body research address SSIs adult , paper address development SSIs pediatric population . Bucher , et al . find SSI prediction model use adult generalizable pediatrics . Extremes age , immune naivety , general physiology , indication type procedure undertaken child significantly different face adult . Research find procedure-specific risk much heavily weight pediatric population patient-specific risk . A number intervention aim reduce procedure-specific risk factor , include : clipping rather shave hair , chlorhexidine v iodine skin preparation , steri-strips v suture vs tissue glue closure , use prophylactic antibiotic . However , study look post-operative dressing role player reduce SSIs . A recent Cochrane Review subject reveal currently evidence suggest dress significantly reduces risk SSI wound heal primary intention . However , Cochrane review also reveal 16 randomize control study include review generally poor quality , small sample size , and/or high bias . Cochrane list follow aspect attribute ideal dressing : - ability absorb contain exudate without leakage - lack particulate contaminant leave wound dress - thermal insulation - impermeability water bacteria - ability use different type skin closure ( ie . stapes , suture ) - avoidance wound trauma removal - minimal frequency dress change - provision pain relief - cosmesis comfort - effect formation scar tissue In 2011 , investigator publish pilot study show simple , cost-effective vacuum dress could reduce wound infection rate pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy 6 % . This dressing fashion place sterile 2 2 inch gauze umbilical port site cover bioocclusive dressing , op-site . A 22-gauge needle insert subcutaneously remove air dress , thereby create vacuum atmosphere . This dress fulfills criterion Cochrane review prefer attribute , easy apply , inexpensive . The use negative-pressure wound treatment ( NPWT ) novel concept - however , specialize VAC dressing costly ( approx $ 107/day ) generally reserve complex , debilitate wound . NPWT think promote wound heal remove local edema , improve vascular lymphatic flow , decrease bacterial density , promote angiogenesis formation granulation tissue . Minimal literature available utility dressing child . Six study show NPWT effective healing complex wind dehiscence pediatric population ; however , investigator ' knowledge , study yet undertaken look role NPWT SSI prevention heal non-complex wound either pediatrics adult . The aim study address issue undertake randomize controlled trial sufficient statistical power prove ( disprove ) simple , vacuum dress effective reduce SSI rate child undergo laparoscopic procedure . The primary outcome measure study rate postoperative wound infection umbilical port site . A sample size calculation use pilot study data demonstrate investigator need 275 patient group Chi-squared test 80 % chance detect difference wound infection rate 6 % 5 % level significance . Approximately 600 patient need recruited Children 's Hospital ensure sufficient statistical power . Based annual number laparoscopic procedures Children 's Hospital ( approximately 400 ) investigator anticipate complete inclusion patient within two-year period . Candidates screen eligibility upon book operative time laparoscopic surgery . These surgery may either elective emergent nature . Patients recruit pediatric surgery service meet patient parents/guardians prior operation discus purpose trial role , choose participate . Written information supply consent obtain patient directly parent/guardian nurse clinic operating room . Once enrolled , patient randomize one two arm : one group receive simple vacuum dress umbilical port ( experimental ) group receive standard dress without vacuum ( control ) . Randomization take place operation complete do via computer-generated list number 1:1 ratio use online tool Research Randomizer . All patient prepped chlorhexidine drape use sterile paper drape . The umbilical incision make horizontal manner trochar introduce use Hasson technique . Both group undergo fascial closure umbilical wound figure-of-8 , 0 vicryl stitch subsequent umbilical port closure 5-0 biosyn simple interrupt subcutaneous suture . A 2x2 sterile gauze apply simple bio-occlusive dressing ( ie . op-site ) . In vacuum dress group , 22-gauge needle introduce subcutaneously dress air suction use 10 cc syringe . Post-operatively , dressing group remove 48 hr , either patient ( parent ) patient discharge home house staff ward inpatient . An independent nurse clinical research unit Manitoba Institute Child Health ( MICH ) blind treatment group examine patient 8-10 day post-operatively diagnose surgical site infection use criterion provide CDC . Funding MICH nurse already approve ( see budget ) . The timeframe follow chosen minimize likelihood patient lose follow maximizing opportunity detection infection , since majority SSIs apparent postoperative day 3-5 . Based pilot study , unlikely simple vacuum dress increase rate SSI however data accrue investigator assess result real time disparity SSIs great 10 % study experimental group . Should disparity exist , either direction , recruitment temporarily hold result analyze statistical significance point . If result significant , investigator consider terminate trial 600 patient recruit change practice accordingly . Data collect trial store computer keep secure location Health Sciences campus . The file keep period 25 year ( young child study turn 25 ) . Only member research group access password-protected server data keep . As patient recruit , assign unique identification number separate PHIN hospital ID . This number use organize data instead patient 's name health information . Only patient 's date birth , weight , sex , diagnosis , procedure type duration , estimate blood loss , length stay , presence absence SSI record . Since identify information patient record , investigator directly contact patient result trial . Instead , patient provide email address ( avatar.clinical.trial @ gmail.com contact , investigator periodically send updates trial .</detailed_description>
