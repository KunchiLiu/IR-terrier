	<brief_title>Identification Asthma Phenotypes Severe Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma heterogeneous disorder present many phenotype . Most asthmatic mild moderate disease . However , 5-20 % asthmatic belong `` Difficult-to-treat '' severe group account 50-80 % asthma health care cost . In tertiary hospital like Singapore General Hospital , asthmatic belong severe group . They frequent healthcare visit , hospitalization , medication use high risk death . There currently local data phenotypic profile patient . Asthma phenotypes identify include related trigger ( eg . drug aspirin NSAIDS , environmental allergen , occupational allergen irritant , exercise ) clinical physiological phenotype ( eg . severity-defined , exacerbation-prone , chronic airflow limitation , steroid-resistant , age -of -onset ) inflammatory phenotype ( eg . eosinophilic , neutrophilic , pauci granulocytic , mixed ) . With good understanding phenotype , treatment individually tailor improve asthma control reduce future risk . We aim improve understand group asthmatic well treatment approach develop future . This clinical trial . Its purpose gather information range demographic data , medical history response simple routine question , lung function , inflammation , allergy blood test result . The data analyze improve understand clinical inflammatory phenotype ( profile ) group patient .</detailed_description>
