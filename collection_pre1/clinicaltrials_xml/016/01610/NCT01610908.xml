	<brief_summary>The primary aim multicenter randomize control trial compare effect 6 month `` Schroth exercise program combine standard-of-care '' `` standard-of-care alone '' scoliosis curve severity measure use Cobb angle . Secondary aim include : 1 . To determine effect Schroth exercise 6 month secondary outcome include quality-of-life , spinal appearance , objective posture spinal muscle endurance measurement . 2 . To determine efficacy 6 month Schroth therapy offer control participant complete 6 month standard-of care group ( use subject control ) 3 . To determine effect 6 month supervise Schroth exercise program maintain supervised therapy terminate . At Hopital Ste-Justine , follow secondary aim pursue examine preliminary evidence effect Global Postural Re-education ( satisfy local ethic committee request Global Postural Re-education exercise offer routinely patient institution prior trial ) . A . To compare effect quantify treatment effect size 6 month `` Global Postural Re-education exercise North American standard Care consist observation bracing '' `` Schroth exercise combine North American standard care '' `` North American standard care alone '' scoliosis curve severity measure use Cobb angle . B . To estimate effect quantify treatment effect size 6 month `` Global Postural Re-education exercise North American standard Care '' `` Schroth exercise combine North American standard care '' `` North American standard care alone '' outcome include quality-of-life , perceive spinal appearance , objective posture spinal muscle endurance measurement . C. To determine effect `` Global Postural Re-education exercise North American standard Care '' maintain discontinue supervision . D. To estimate feasibility conduct randomize trial focus Global Postural Re-education exercise quantify enrollment rate , attendance schedule exercise session compliance home exercise prescribe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicenter Schroth Exercise Trial Scoliosis ( SETS study ) Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) progressive 3D deformity spine . It common orthopedic condition adolescent . Of curve large 10° , 90 % female . Scoliosis often result chronic pain , poor posture , function , self-image . Curves great 30° brace later surgically correct . In Europe Americas , small curve ( &lt; 30° ) treat exercise prevent need brace moderate curve brace exercise prevent surgery . Bracing uncomfortable patient fear surgery . In contrast , exercise generally well receive . Schroth exercise study scoliosis exercise achieve good outcome . Schroth first exercise approach offer formal certification training . No randomized control trial focus Schroth method . Only 1 randomize control trial 3 prospective control study important methodological flaw include recent review effect type scoliosis exercise find exercise slow worsen scoliosis . A randomized control trial Schroth exercise need . Schroth exercise asymmetric scoliosis-specific postural exercise aim improve curve , posture , pain , function , self-image . Schroth exercise target endurance strength train abdominal , back , leg muscle . Schroth exercise also aim improve motor control posture repeat corrective movement progressively less feedback . Objectives : ( 1 ) To compare effect 6 month `` Schroth exercise combine standard-of-care '' `` standard-of-care alone '' scoliosis curve severity measure use Cobb angle . Secondary aim include determine treatment effect quality-of-life , spinal appearance , posture spinal muscle endurance monitoring effect maintain long-term follow-up . See objective correspond secondary analysis plan Hopital Ste-Justine . Methodology : Participants : Two hundred fifty-eight female AIS recruit study scoliosis clinic . Females 10-16 year old curve 10° 45° , Risser le equal 3 include . Patients plan surgery , surgery , worn brace discharge exclude . Procedures : Participants randomize standard-of-care group ( observation brace Boston brace criterion meet ) Schroth exercise treatment group . ( At hospital Ste-Justine , ethic committee request include third trial arm , randomize equal number subject three trial arm ( Global Postural Re-education , Schroth Standard care ) use variable block randomization specific site . This imply recruit estimate additional 52 patient randomize Global Postural Re-education group . ) Outcomes measure evaluator blind randomization status baseline 3 6 month follow-up . The primary outcome spinal curvature angle radiograph 6 month . Secondary outcome analyze 3 , 6 month include radiograph ( Cobb angle , rotation ) , Scoliosis Research Society-22r quality-of-life domain score ( self-image , function , pain ) , spinal appearance questionnaire domain score , postural measure ( surface topography ) , Sørensen back muscle endurance . Radiographs Scoliosis Research Society-22 measure routine scoliosis clinic visit also obtain clinic database discharge routine care . Measurement property measure adequate . Standard-of-care subject observation treat brace meet Scoliosis Research Society brace criterion 6 month offer Schroth exercise treatment recruitment incentive necessary base pilot . Treated patient receive supervise standardized Schroth exercise combine home program addition standard care 6 month . Parents involve enhance ( monitor ) compliance . ( At hôpital Ste-Justine , one group receive 6-month supervise Global Postural Re-education intervention consist individual training session therapist combine home exercise program consist 1 2 exercise perform twice weekly addition standard care ) . Analyses : Linear mixed model use assess difference group change baseline , 3 month 6-month , adjust relevant covariates ( include age , risk progression ) . Expected finding : Schroth exercise improve curve characteristic , quality life , posture , pain , muscular endurance patient adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . The study team integrate within Edmonton scoliosis clinic , Montréal 's Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine clinic Calgary 's Alberta Children Hospital Clinic . Research result directly influence practice .</detailed_description>
