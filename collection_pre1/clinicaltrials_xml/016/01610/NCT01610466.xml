	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To design validate proficiency-based ex-vivo training curriculum laparoscopic bariatric surgery . BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic bariatric surgery advance laparoscopic procedure potential significant morbidity mortality along early part surgeon 's learning curve . Simulation-based training show improve surgeon 's technical performance shorten learn curve operate room . Despite benefit , specific simulation-based training curriculum widely adopt residency train program . This likely result lack valid simulation-based training curriculum minimally invasive operation . Presently , evidence-based ex-vivo training curriculum laparoscopic bariatric surgery . The purpose project develop validate curriculum . HYPOTHESIS : Completion propose training curriculum expect result superior cognitive knowledge , superior technical skill operate room , superior performance simulate crisis scenario compare standard residency training . METHODS : The evidence-based training curriculum make cognitive , technical , non-technical component . The cognitive component deliver procedure-specific knowledge , technical component provide train basic procedure-specific laparoscopic skill . Non-technical component address additional component surgical competency include situation awareness , decision making , task management , leadership , communication teamwork . Technical skill learn bench-top cadaveric porcine model . Training follow distribute practice schedule preset proficiency benchmarks achieve . The proposed training curriculum validate single-blinded randomized control trial compare procedure-specific knowledge , technical performance operating room , non-technical skill simulate crisis scenario 12 surgical resident curricular train group 12 resident standard residency train group . Cognitive knowledge assess multiple choice examination . Technical performance assess previously validate procedure-specific global rating scale . Non-technical skill assess use previously validate NOTECHS scale . CONCLUSIONS : The design implementation propose training curriculum potential affect surgical training program national international level standardize proficiency surgical trainee prior start operate room training . This standardization expect shorten learn curve improve patient safety operate room .</detailed_description>
