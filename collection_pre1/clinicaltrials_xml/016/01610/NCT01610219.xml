	<brief_summary>The number youth Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) rise population , concern public health trend . There little research test way prevent development disease child increase risk develop T2D . This study test family treatment program treat 4-8 year old child risk T2D overweight family history disease . Sixty risk child parent assign one 2 treatment condition . Half family ( randomly determine ) receive intensive family treatment program train parent increase healthy food choice physical activity child use `` behavior modification '' strategy . Children receive treatment allow taste new fruit vegetable use pedometer record far walked every day , give `` tool box '' toy interactive game promote physical activity . The half family receive instruction healthier choice , receive behavioral modification strategy physical activity promotion tool . Improvements child 's body weight , blood measure , behavior pattern measure treatment end ( 6 month ) 12 month . The result may lead good understand family member positively influence young child 's behavior help prevent T2D . The objective propose study test family-based intervention design reduce excess body weight , improve metabolic cardiovascular profile , improve diet physical activity level 4 - 8 year old youth `` risk '' T2D . This intervention test 2-arm randomized control clinical trial . Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Compared child receive NPA , child receive LMDP show great reduction excess body weight , great improvement metabolic cardiovascular measure , improve diet , increased physical activity , reduce television viewing . 2 . Greater reduction child excess body weight associate great improvement metabolic cardiovascular measure . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Compared parent receive NPA intervention , parent receive LMDP intervention show great reduction BMI . 2 . Greater improvement parent BMI associate great improvement child body composition , metabolic cardiovascular measure , behavioral outcome . 3 . Compared family receive NPA intervention , family receive LMDP intervention show increase number fruit vegetable low energy density food store home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Modification Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Overweight Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There mount concern development Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) youth , especially light rise childhood obesity rate young age . The health cost T2D notable individual society , intervention help prevent development T2D early life need . Fortunately , promise evidence Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) randomize trial adult onset T2D prevent sustainable lifestyle change . However , intervention program test young child `` risk '' develop disease , even though may critical period obesity onset formation early eating physical activity habit . The primary aim propose study test family-based intervention target improvements excess weight gain , metabolic cardiovascular profile , diet physical activity 4 - 8 year old child `` risk '' T2D . Specifically , 60 family randomize either one two treatment : Lifestyle Modification Diabetes Prevention ( LMDP , N= 30 ) Nutrition Physical Activity Information ( NPA , N= 30 ) . The LMDP intervention train family behavioral strategy increase parent child intake fruit , vegetable , high fiber food , limit intake energy-dense food , increase daily physical activity . A physical activity `` tool kit '' home environment provide family . Supporting information T2D obesity , well nutrition physical activity , also provide . Besides participate parent-child pair , adult family member T2D ( eg , grandparent , aunt , uncle ) encourage participate . The LMDP activity intend reduce child 's excess body weight improve metabolic cardiovascular measure , help prevent onset insulin resistance . The NPA intervention receive basic information T2D obesity , nutrition physical activity recommendation . Changes child body composition , metabolic cardiovascular measure , behavioral outcomes evaluate 6 month ( ie , end-of-treatment ) 12 month ( ie , follow ) . Changes parent weight status home food environment secondary outcome assess potential mediator child outcome .</detailed_description>
