	<brief_title>Eltrombopag Treatment Immune ThrombocytoPenia ( ITP ) Secondary Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders ( LPDs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The denomination Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders ( LPD ) encompass variety indolent lymphoma group single clinical category , , terminology include current WHO classification . With indolent lymphoma clinician refer lymphomas associate aggressive clinical course often treatment delay . Specifically follow lymphoma WHO classification consider among indolent lymphoma : small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia , follicular lymphoma , marginal zone lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , hairy-cell leukemia , Hodgkin 's lymphoma . In 1 5 % different LPDs ( low follicular lymphoma , high chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) clinically relevant thrombocytopenia , often complicate bleeding symptom , may complicate clinical course , frequently still tumor burden low demand treatment . This thrombocytopenia , accompany massive bone marrow tumor infiltration secondary chemotherapeutic treatment , think share immune pathogenic mechanism similar primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) . With conventional treatment ( i.e . iv Ig , steroid ) overall response rate ITP secondary LPD generally low primary ITP , usually high 50 % ( 95 % CI 27-72 ) . Therefore , new treatment response rate 50 % inferior 20 % could consider promising treatment ITP secondary LPD . Furthermore , significant platelet increase expect without treatment ITP secondary LPD . Eltrombopag prove effective primary ITP could effective also ITP secondary LPDs . This novel ITP specific treatment might spare patient bleed risk also toxic inappropriate cytotoxic therapy , otherwise demand burden underlying disease . Phase 2 , single arm , open-label , prospective , multicenter , safety/efficacy study .</detailed_description>
