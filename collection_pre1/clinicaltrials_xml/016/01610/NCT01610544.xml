	<brief_summary>Background : - Imaging study like positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan use detect tumor response cancer treatment . However , may difficult detect early response lung cancer thymoma treatment standard PET/CT scan . These scan easily show difference remain cancer cell inflammation . Researchers want try new PET/CT scan tracer may able show difference cell . 18F-Fluorothymidine ( 18F-FLT ) well show cell still actively divide . PET/CT scan 18F-FLT may help show tumor cell respond early stage treatment . Objectives : - To see 18F-FLT safe effective imaging study tracer show early cancer response treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age treat lung cancer thymoma . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood , urine , tumor tissue sample collect . - Participants two PET/CT scan separate day start chemotherapy . One scan standard radiotracer . The 18F-FLT tracer . - About 2 week start chemotherapy , participant repeat two PET/CT scan separate day . Additional blood sample collect time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - ( 18 ) F FLT , thymidine analog , uptake tumor correlate proliferative rate may early predictor tumor response . - Due uptake inflammatory tissue , routinely use ( 18 ) F FDG PET/CT often unable distinguish therapeutic response reactive change early therapy . - Molecularly target therapy relate MEK kinase pathway non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) IGF pathway ( anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody ) thymoma , affect tumor proliferation . - We intend explore potential utility ( 18 ) F FLT PET/CT image early marker therapeutic response molecularly targeted therapy relate MEK kinase pathway NSCLC IGF pathway thymic tumor . Objectives : -To explore relationship change ( 18 ) F FLT tumor uptake ( pre-treatment soon initiation treatment ( 2 week ) ) progression free survival NSCLC patient treat AZD6244 thymoma patient IMC-A12 , Cixutumumab Eligibility : - Subjects pathology proven lung cancer thymoma enrol NCI therapy protocol . - Participant must 18 year old ECOG Performance less equal 2 . - Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion . - Patients must ability provide informed consent . All subject must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform . Design : -This pilot study incorporate ( 18 ) F FLT ( 18 ) F FDG PET/CT imaging session prior therapy AZD6244 , Selumetinib , NSCLC IMC-A12 , Cixutumumab , thymoma , 2 week ( +/- 4 day ) follow therapy initiation . The image parameter evaluate respect clinical response ( determined refer protocol ) . We expect enroll 24 evaluable patient single center study .</detailed_description>
