	<brief_summary>Background : - Diabetic macular edema common eye complication diabetes . It cause blood vessel retina back eye leak , cause swell . The macula center part retina important see fine detail task read , drive , sew . Swelling macula lead vision loss possible blindness . Inflammation may play role diabetic macular edema . It also possible problem blood vessel blood supply cell retina . - A chemical body call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) important formation blood vessel body . Lowering VEGF level may help treat diabetic macular edema reduce abnormal leak blood vessel eye . Drugs low block VEGF include ranibizumab bevacizumab . Both drug show help treat diabetic macular edema . Researchers want see one drug work well . Objective : To compare effectiveness ranibizumab bevacizumab injection diabetic macular edema . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age diabetic macular edema least one eye . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . A full eye exam perform . Blood urine sample collect . - One eye select study eye receive treatment . If eye affect , eye may enrol study receive different drug treatment . - The main part study last 9 month . At study visit , participant physical exam eye exam . They answer question health side effect drug . - Participants assign one four group . Two group two series ranibizumab one series bevacizumab shot . The two group two series bevacizumab one series ranibizumab shot . A series three eye injection drug every 4 week . The injection give study visit . The series order vary different group . - After 9 month , participant continue additional study visit . If treatment seem successful , study doctor may increase time visit . Study injection may give need every 4 week 3 year . - Participants may laser treatment study eye need . After study 1 year , may also steroid injection treatment direct macular edema .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) remain leading cause visual impairment . A frequent manifestation DR diabetic macular edema ( DME ) laser photocoagulation proven treatment last several decade . Studies show anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) injection bevacizumab ranibizumab efficacious treat patient DME . However , direct comparison agent determine whether one treatment effective . The objective study compare treatment efficacy ranibizumab versus bevacizumab eye DME . Study Population : Sixty ( 60 ) participant macular edema secondary diabetes stage DR ( require scatter laser photocoagulation proliferative DR ) one eye enrol randomized study . Design : In Phase II , multi-center , comparative , double-masked study , eye randomly assign receive ranibizumab bevacizumab . During initial phase study participant participate three-period , 36-week , crossover study study eye assign one four treatment group ( i.e. , treatment sequence ) . The two drug three period form RRB/RBB/BBR/BRR pattern follow : - Group 1 ( RRB pattern ) eye receive series intravitreal injection ranibizumab baseline Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 20 , crossover receive series intravitreal injection bevacizumab Weeks 24 , 28 32 . - Group 2 ( RBB pattern ) eye receive series intravitreal injection ranibizumab baseline Weeks 4 8 , crossover receive series intravitreal injection bevacizumab Weeks 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 32 . - Group 3 ( BBR pattern ) eye receive series intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 20 , crossover receive series intravitreal injection ranibizumab Weeks 24 , 28 32 . - Group 4 ( BRR pattern ) eye receive series intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline Weeks 4 8 , crossover receive series intravitreal injection ranibizumab Weeks 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 32 . Participants one eye enrol study eye randomly assign one four group . Participants eye enrol study right eye randomly assign one four group ; leave eye assign group schedule inverse right eye . For example , right eye randomly assign Group 1 ( RRB pattern ) , leave eye automatically assign Group 3 ( BBR pattern ) . Thus , treatment , right eye participant enrol eye study always receive different investigational product leave eye . Following crossover phase , eye return treatment ( ranibizumab bevacizumab ) originally assign treat as-needed basis common termination date one year enrollment last-enrolled participant National Eye Institute ( NEI ) Year 1 Bristol Eye Hospital ( BEH ) . Both treat investigator participant mask group assignment . The primary outcome assess Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 Year 1 . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure mean change Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) . Changes BCVA baseline four week follow end three period ( i.e. , Weeks 12 , 24 36 ) Year 1 use primary analysis . Secondary outcome ( assess baseline Week 12 visit , Weeks 12 24 visit Weeks 24 36 visit Year 1 ) include mean change central macular thickness central retinal volume treatment group measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ; slope change BCVA , central macular thickness retinal volume ; proportion eye visual improvement ≥ 10 letter ; proportion eye visual improvement ≥ 15 letter ; proportion eye ≥ 0.1 log unit loss gain logOCT ; proportion eye ≥ 0.05 log unit loss gain logOCT ; change fluid leakage macula demonstrate fluorescein angiography ; change macular structural improvement ( i.e. , resolution cystic change ) measure OCT . The digital OCT image collect Baseline Week 36 visit grade mask , external Reading Center . Other secondary outcome include proportion eye meet criterion significant worsening , treatment success , treatment failure , frequency re-injection among eye treatment-as-needed phase study , proportion eye receive focal/grid laser photocoagulation adjuvant treatment course study . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse event . The number eye withdraw investigational product due vision loss adverse event number eye deem worsen disease also contribute assessment safety .</detailed_description>
