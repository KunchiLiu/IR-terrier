	<brief_summary>Airborne particle present indoor environment include operating room . Most particle come surgical staff move around room , position patient surgery , movement surgical equipment supply . While amount particulate operating room much , much less found typical home public space , particulate usually present matter room air clean filter . Typically particulate cause problem , goal always cleanest air possible surgery . The Air Barrier System ( ABS ) consist reusable blower sterile nozzle . The blower feed filter air sterile disposable nozzle , disperse constant stream gentle , high purity air surgical incision . This stream air form shield surgical area prevent airborne particulate settle open wound . This particularly critical long-duration surgery , procedure involve implantation prosthesis . The main objective research study determine whether ABS reduce potential surgical site infection total hip replacement , spinal fusion , low extremity bypass grafting procedure . These procedure choose long-duration procedure involve implantation prosthesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) follow prosthesis implantation invasive procedure serious complication lead increased mortality , morbidity , financial cost patient U.S. healthcare infrastructure . Multiple study show primary source surgical site bacterial colonization staphylococci shed skin people present surgical theatre . These bacteria-carrying skin cell aerosolize environment deposit surgical incision . The innovation currently pursue research industry combat nosocomial infection fall primarily three category : ( 1 ) develop new antimicrobial drug agent , ( 2 ) develop antimicrobial coating device , ( 3 ) implementing procedure reduce risk cross-contamination . Significant resource allocate prevent infection develop post-operatively mitigate effect infection microorganism enter body . However , little development new technology employ operate room prevent initial intrusion surgery site . All modern surgical theatre utilize form air filtration . In conventional flow system , air stream mix freely room . In OR design laminar flow ( LFOR ) , air emits filter proceeds room relatively coherent stream . The benefit think achieve LFOR , principle , filter air mix contaminate air reach surgery area . The difficulty achieve desire result LFOR lie fact flow pattern enters room , subject complex set dynamic significant distance . Air clean upon leave filter bank , enters space laden airborne bacteria particulate matter shed people OR . Nimbic Systems develop device , Air Barrier System ( ABS ) , shields surgical site airborne contaminant operate room create localized clean air field directly adjacent surround incision site . The ABS consist two component : Filter air Nozzle attach Hose . The Filter nonsterile reusable component filter ambient operate room air force exit port top unit . The Nozzle attach top incision drape adjacent surgical incision VelcroÂ® fastening pad . The end Hose plug Filter 's air exit port . Contaminant-free air flow Hose Nozzle incision site . The ABS maintain protective envelope bacteria-free air wide range patient incision site geometry , yet insertion hand instrument disrupt protective envelope . The ABS technology extremely successful reduce presence bacteria colony form unit incision sit Phase I study . In randomized , prospective clinical study 36 hip arthroplasty procedure , ABS reduce presence colony form unit incision sit 84 % versus ambient operate room level . This prospective randomize double-blind pilot trial ABS three surgical specialty application ( total hip arthroplasty , lumbar laminectomy instrumentation , femoral-popliteal bypass graft ) . A cohort 300 recruit patient randomly assign , 1:1 ratio , either control group ( ABS ) experimental group ( ABS ) . The primary outcome trial occurrence SSI one year surgery use establish CDC definition classification surgical site infection . Secondary outcome include ( 1 ) measuring level colony form unit ( CFU ) present operate room air surgical procedure examine correlation occurrence SSI ; ( 2 ) examine type organism cause SSI two study group ; ( 3 ) surgeon satisfaction ABS device . Patient characteristic measure operate room environment collect surgery , patient ' surgical site clinically evaluate follow surgery identify potential superficial deep SSI one year surgery . The estimated occurrence SSI control group 6 % , base baseline data pertain three studied type surgery Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center . The anticipated rate SSI experimental group 3 % . The propose pilot study design detect clinically relevant reduction ( i.e. , 50 % reduction , 6 % 3 % ) observe rate SSI patient expose ABS vs. ABS . The result propose pilot trial use construct subsequent pivotal prospective , randomize , multi-center clinical trial .</detailed_description>
