	<brief_summary>Background : - Mithramycin drug first test cancer therapy 1960s . It act form cancer , never accept treatment . Research suggest may useful solid tumor , particularly Ewing sarcoma . Researchers want see mithramycin use treat solid tumor child adult . It test different group people , include type Ewing sarcoma contain chemical call Ewings sarcoma - friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor ( EWS-FLI1 ) . Objectives : - To see mithramycin safe effective solid tumor Ewing sarcoma child adult . Eligibility : - Children young adult 1 17 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment . - Adults least 18 year age EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma respond standard treatment . - Children young adult 1 17 year age EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study tumor tissue sample use monitor cancer treatment . Individuals solid brain tumor eligible . - Participants receive mithramycin every day 7 day , follow 14 day without treatment . Each 28-day round treatment call cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants continue take drug long side effect severe tumor respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Mithramycin , anti-tumor antibiotic , underwent broad clinical evaluation solid tumor leukemias 1960s demonstrated activity leukemia , lymphoma , solid tumor . In particular , mithramycin find activity testicular cancer briefly use clinic tumor prior development currently use treatment regimen . - The Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors ( ESFT ) second common malignant bone tumor childhood . There little improvement overall patient survival past year , particularly patient high risk metastatic relapse disease . Therefore , need effective novel agent treatment disease . - Multiple study show suppress expression EWS-FLI1 effectively limit tumorigenicity ESFT cell . Laboratory study show mithramycin effectively suppress activity EWS-FLI1 vitro vivo . OBJECTIVES ( PRIMARY ) : - Phase I portion study : determine tolerability , toxicity , recommend phase II dose mithramycin child adolescents refractory extracranial solid tumor . - Phase II portion trial : determine objective response rate ( complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) ) Ewing sarcoma mithramycin child adult use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion administer 17.5 microgram/kg 6 hour daily 7 day repeat every 28 day unacceptable toxicity disease progression . - Phase II portion trial : evaluate mithramycin inhibits NR0B1 tumor tissue determine change gene expression signature pre-treatment steady state day +4 treatment patient great equal 18 year old Ewing sarcoma EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript disease amenable percutaneous biopsy . ELIGIBILITY : - Phase I Portion : child ( great equal 12 month ) adolescent ( less equal 17 year ) recurrent refractory extracranial solid tumor . - Phase II Portion adult : adult ( great equal 18 year age enrollment ) recurrent refractory measurable extracranial Ewing sarcoma EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript . - Phase II Portion child adolescent : Once adult dose deem safe , child ( great equal 12 month ) adolescent ( less equal 17 year ) recurrent refractory measurable extracranial Ewing sarcoma EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript begin enrollment Phase II portion . - Participants must meet safety laboratory criterion prior therapy limitation . DESIGN : Phase I Portion : Mithramycin administer escalate dos child adolescent intravenously 6 hour daily 7 day repeat every 28 day unacceptable toxicity disease progression . The cohort recommend dose maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) expand 12 patient , attempt make enroll 6 patient great equal 12 year age 6 patient &lt; 12 year age gain experience broad age range patient . A maximum 18 evaluable patient enrol phase I portion . - Phase II Portion : Using Simon two stage design , mithramycin administer intravenously 17.5 microgram/kg 6 hour daily 7 day repeat every 28 day unacceptable toxicity disease progression child adult Ewing sarcoma EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript . Up 24 evaluable patient enrol phase II portion . - The Phase I Phase II portion protocol enroll patient simultaneously .</detailed_description>
