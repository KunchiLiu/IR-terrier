	<brief_summary>The urea cycle consist series chemical reaction body convert toxic waste- nitrogen substance call urea dispose easily . While disposal nitrogen major function urea cycle , recent research show enzymes urea cycle also important production nitric oxide . Nitric oxide important chemical many function human body include regulation blood pressure . Through study , investigator study production nitric oxide subject citrullinemia type 1 administer stable isotope subject . Stable isotope harmless compound use track measure production specific compound human body . The overall goal study understand citrullinemia patient deficiency nitric oxide production . This knowledge may impact treatment patient citrullinemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide Flux Ureagenesis Argininosuccinate Synthetase Deficiency ( ASSD ) ( Citrullinemia I )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This interventional , case control study investigate production nitric oxide patient citrullinemia type I . Through infusion isotope [ 15N2-ureido ] arginine , [ 5-13C,4 , 4 , 5 , 5-D4 ] citrulline , [ 15N ] citrulline , 15N sodium nitrate [ 15N ] [ 18O3 ] potassium nitrate , flux citrulline nitrate urea cycle pathway measure conjunction independent measure total plasma arginine flux . This informative dissecting contribution de novo production arginine vs. exogenous contribution arginine total body NO flux . Total body urea production measure isotopic dilution constantly infuse [ 18O ] [ 13C ] urea . These flux measurement correlate level residual enzyme activity clinical phenotype citrullinemia patient . The investigator plan enroll three patient citrullinemia . Three unaffected control subject also study .</detailed_description>
