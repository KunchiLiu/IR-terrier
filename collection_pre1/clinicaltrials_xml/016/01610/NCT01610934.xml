	<brief_title>The Effects GLP-1 Maturity-Onset Diabetes The Young ( MODY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maturity-onset diabetes young ( MODY ) monogenic form diabetes responsible approximately 1-2 % case diabetes . The disease clinically define : 1 ) autosomal dominant inheritance ( diabetes least two consecutive generation ) , 2 ) non-insulin dependent diabetes onset ( measurable serum C-peptide three year onset ) , 3 ) diagnosis young age ( least one family member onset age 25 year ) . Clinically , MODY-patients resemble patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . MODY genetically heterogeneous , know mutation eight different gene mutation either gene lead specific form MODY . Based national epidemiological survey , know Denmark , approximately 50 % patient diagnose MODY mutation hepatocyte nuclear factor ( HNF ) 4 alpha ( HNF4A ) ( MODY1 ) , glucokinase ( GCK ) ( MODY2 ) , HNF1A ( MODY3 ) gene . MODY3 common form MODY Denmark ( approximately 60 % patient MODY ) . Patients MODY3 often diagnose around puberty , 50 % mutation carrier develop diabetes age 25 , lifetime risk develop diabetes higher 95 % . The typical course disease characterise rapid progression impair glucose tolerance diabetes . After diagnosis diabetes , glucose tolerance impair due continuous loss beta cell function . MODY3 often develop abruptly classic hyperglycaemic symptom polyuria polydipsia , form diabetes often misclassified T1DM . Patients MODY3 risk develop microvascular macrovascular late diabetic complication patient T2DM , , strict glycaemic control combine proper screen diabetic late complication crucial good prognosis . About half MODY3 patient treat diet oral antidiabetic agent , latter mostly form sulphonylureas ( SU ) , , possible preferred insulin injection . Due high sensitivity SU combine normal even increase insulin sensitivity ( MODY3 patient insulin sensitive age- body mass index ( BMI ) -matched patient T2DM ) , treatment often associate hypoglycaemia even rather low dos SU use . Although SU treatment offhand seem constitute logical choice treatment MODY , due beta cell dysfunction , risk hypoglycaemia clinical drawback due potential suboptimal glycaemic control decrease patient compliance . In recent study , patient MODY3 expose physical activity ( light cycle 30 minute approximately 2 hour meal ingestion ) , hypoglycaemia observe 40 % subject treat short-acting SU ( glibenclamide ) one patient experience hypoglycaemia 12 hour . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) incretin hormone , secrete endocrine L cell small intestine response nutrient gut lumen . GLP-1 conveys insulinotropic effect GLP-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) pancreatic beta cell thereby decrease plasma glucose ( PG ) . Moreover , GLP-1 inhibit secretion glucagon pancreatic alpha cell , contributes lower PG level . Both effect strictly glucose-dependent ( pronounced high PG level ) effect cease PG level reach value 4-5 mM . Therefore , hormone keep PG normal level without increase risk hypoglycaemia . In addition , GLP-1 inhibit gastrointestinal motility include gastric empty lead centrally-mediated inhibition appetite result reduce food intake . Thus , GLP-1 essential glycaemic control . The GLP-1R agonist , liraglutide ( Victoza® ) , 97 % homology naturally occur GLP-1 hormone , long half-life ( 11-15 hour ) . Since effect incretin hormone strictly glucose-dependent , treatment GLP-1R agonist rarely associate hypoglycaemia . Thus , current study aim elucidate whether liraglutide ( Victoza® ) could safe efficacious new treatment modality patient MODY .</detailed_description>
