	<brief_summary>The purpose study use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) 4 Tesla measure brain glycine level noninvasively baseline 2 hour single oral dose concentrate glycine-containing beverage , compare MRS glycine measurement glycine blood level sample obtain MRS spectrum . The investigator hypothesize observe high correlation magnitude increase brain plasma glycine level time frame . The investigator also hypothesize observe large intersubject variability glycine uptake rate brain blood . The investigator also hypothesize subject glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC ) mutation ( triplication ) low baseline plasma brain glycine level experience small brain plasma glycine increase glycine consumption control family member without GLDC mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High dos glycine ( 0.4-0.8 g/kg/day ) administer orally along certain antipsychotic medication improve negative symptom schizophrenia ( e.g. , Heresco-Levy et al. , 1999 ) . The therapeutic effect appear due glycine 's co-agonist activity glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor , may correct glutamatergic hypofunction associate schizophrenia ( e.g. , Bergeron et al. , 1998 ) . Unfortunately , therapeutic benefit orally administer glycine variable , part gut glycine absorption resultant plasma ( presumably brain ) glycine increase variable ( Silk et al. , 1974 ) . Even intravenous glycine administration , bypass variability contribute gut absorption metabolism , between-subject variability cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) glycine increment large ( D'Souza et al. , 2000 ) , suggest brain glycine uptake , metabolism , turnover differ substantially among individual . If brain glycine increment oral glycine dose highly variable , manifest small transient brain glycine increment may experience clinically significant effect . As result , glycine 's therapeutic efficacy could underappreciated . Indeed , multi-site glycine trial schizophrenia subject conclude glycine `` …generally effective therapeutic option treat negative symptom cognitive impairment '' , include caveat `` …it know efficacy would achieve substantially high serum glycine level '' ( Buchanan et al. , 2007 ) . Accordingly , believe important fully characterize glycine 's brain plasma pharmacodynamic variability , healthy subject several member family member possess mutation glycine decarboxylase gene ( GLDC ) , may associate abnormal baseline brain plasma glycine level increment glycine administration . We use MRS method develop detect brain glycine increase high-dose oral glycine administration ( Prescot et al. , 2006 ; Kaufman et al. , 2009 ) along standard analytical method determine plasma glycine level .</detailed_description>
