	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause disparity year life lose race low socioeconomic status . Statins show decrease risk cardiovascular event among individual high CVD risk . Yet , despite increase statin use overall decline CVD rate , disparity statin use disparity control high cholesterol race , ethnicity , socioeconomic status persist . Objective : To improve appropriate use statin primary cardiovascular disease prevention among high risk individual community health center system population health management use electronic health record ( EHR ) data identify patient target education outreach . Aim 1 : Conduct randomize control trial among individual 10-year risk myocardial infarction coronary death 10 % high determine population health management intervention , compare usual care , result higher rate document statin treatment discussion within 6 month ( primary process outcome ) , high rate statin prescribe within 6 month ( secondary process outcome ) , high rate significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) lowering define follow LDL-C â‰¥30 mg/dL low baseline ( primary clinical outcome ) . Aim 2 : Interview patient receive intervention identify barrier success Aim 3 : Assess overall cost intervention cost per patient achieves significant LDL-C lowering compare patient receive usual care .</brief_summary>
