	<brief_title>Evaluation Treatment Related Toxicity After Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Radiotherapy one main curative treatment option advance head neck cancer . With introduction alter fractionation schedule concurrent chemotherapy locoregional control number overall survival improve significantly . This come cost excess acute late toxicity . The steep dose gradient associate conformal radiotherapy technique intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) allow u maintain adequate coverage target volume reduce dose surround normal tissue , thus potentially spar excess acute late toxicity . However accurately evaluate value new technique documentation treatment related toxicity quality life essential . Standardized quality life score system develop purpose . Especially xerostomia hard evaluate , although remains important issue follow-up patient . Purpose In study investigator want analyze treatment related toxicity , special emphasis xerostomia dysphagia patient treat radiotherapy head neck cancer present standardize quality life questionnaire well define point treatment ( 2 month , six month , one year , two year RT ) . The result questionnaires correlate treatment data . Study Design The investigator include patient follow-up primary ( chemo- ) radiotherapy head neck cancer period 4 year . At well defined time point primary ( chemo- ) radiotherapy head neck cancer investigator ask patient fill standardize questionnaire compromise EORTC QLQ H &amp; N35 questionnaire , university Michigan Xerostomia questionnaire ( XQ ) MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory . The treat physician score toxicity use RTOG/EORTC late toxicity score system functional oral intake scale ( FOIS ) . This toxicity data analyzed correlate treatment data . Special interest go relationship presence xerostomia dos deliver subvolumes parotid gland , submandibular gland oral cavity .</detailed_description>
