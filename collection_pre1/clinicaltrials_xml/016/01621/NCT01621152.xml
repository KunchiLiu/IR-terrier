	<brief_summary>Introduction : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) increase mortality , hospital cost , rate progression toward end stage kidney disease 1-4 . Early diagnosis management AKI know improve mention outcomes . Hypothesis : investigator design validate electronic surveillance tool screen ICU admission earlier , efficient diagnosis AKI result improve outcome AKI ICU patient . Methods : investigator plan use patient database , AKIN ( AKI network ) definition design electronic alert system allow clinician discover patient develop AKI . Then randomize clinical trial conduct compare earlier intervention ( base Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes [ KDIGO ] guideline ) initiate AKI sniffer alert conventional management provide primary physician ICU .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PRevention Acute Kidney Injury Initiated With Electronic Surveillance Enhancement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective control , unblinded clinical trial conduct among AKI patient detect use AKI sniffer . The investigator randomize consecutive patient detect AKI AKI sniffer two group . In one group ( control group ) , patient receive standard clinical care primary ICU physician . The primary physician take care control subject keep blinded result AKI sniffer . All ICU physician receive copy KDIGO ( March 2012 ) guideline management AKI prior initiation patient accrual . In intervention group , research team inform primary care team occurrence AKI provide copy KDIGO guideline management AKI clinician . Each subject follow hospital discharge maximum 3 month , clinical laboratory data include peak serum creatinine , creatinine end follow , peak AKIN stage , along secondary outcome . The investigator exclude prevalent case ( AKI patient AKI document medical record clinician prior ICU admission ) .</detailed_description>
