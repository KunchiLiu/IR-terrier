Contraceptive measure Plan B™ , sell emergency use unprotected sex , acceptable method routine use . Patient understand study procedure agree participate study give write informed consent ( Consent must give study procedure perform ) Patient willing comply study restriction adhere visit/protocol schedule . Patient judge good health ( except asthma ) base medical history , physical examination , vital sign measurement , laboratory safety test perform prestudy ( screen ) visit and/or prior administration initial dose study drug evidence cardiac , endocrine , metabolic disease . Patient Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ≤ 39 kg/m2 prestudy screening ( Visit 1 ) . BMI calculate take patient 's weight kg divide patient 's height meter , square . Patient 's body must fit within scanner sufficiently well allow satisfactory imaging opinion investigator . Patient current nonsmoker patient history smoking , smoke least 6 month smoke history 5 packyears ( i.e. , 1 pack per day 5 year ) . Patients discontinue smoke use nicotine / nicotine contain product least approximately 3 month may enrol study discretion investigator . Patient define study site team allergic asthma . Patient able perform reproducible pulmonary function test ( i.e. , 2 best acceptable spirogram FEV1 value vary 5 % large value 100 mL , whichever great ) . Patient clinically significant abnormality electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform prestudy ( screen ) visit and/or prior administration initial dose study drug . Patient contraindication MRI exam . Additional Inclusion Criteria Mild Asthma Known diagnosis asthma least one year define NHLBI NAEPP guideline . ( http : //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/execsumm.pdf ) . FEV1 &gt; 80 % predict Either reversibility airflow obstruction 4 puff inhale albuterol 12 % either FEV1 FVC , hyperresponsiveness methacholine PC20 FEV1 &lt; 16 mg/ml . Asthma Control Questionnaire score &lt; 1.25 consistent good control Additional Inclusion Criteria Moderate Severe Asthma Known diagnosis asthma least one year define NHLBI NAEPP guideline . ( http : //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/execsumm.pdf ) . MODERATE : Symptoms consistent moderate asthma define 2007 NAEPP guideline . Treatment low medium dose ICS +/ second controller ( long act beta agonist leukotriene antagonist ) . Spirometry consistent moderate asthma define NHLBI NAEPP guideline evidence either reversibility airflow obstruction 4 puff inhale albuterol 12 % either FEV1 FVC , hyperresponsiveness methacholine PC20 FEV1 &lt; 16 mg/ml . SEVERE : Treatment high dose inhale corticosteroid equivalent fluticasone &gt; 880 μg/day beclomethasone &gt; 1260 μg/day . Two Following : 1 . Requirement daily controller therapy addition inhale corticosteroid include long acting beta agonist leukotriene antagonist 2 . Symptoms require short act beta agonist use daily 3 . Persistent airway obstruction ( FEV1 &lt; 80 % , peak expiratory flow variability &gt; 20 % ) 4 . One urgent care visit asthma per year 5 . Three `` burst '' oral corticosteroid per year 6 . Prompt deterioration great 25 % reduction inhale oral corticosteroid dose Note : near fatal asthma event past part definition , subject eligible study fulfill criterion within past 5 year . Exclusion Criteria Patient mentally legally incapacitate , significant emotional problem time Screening ( Visit 1 ) expect conduct study history clinically significant psychiatric disorder last 5 year . Subjects situational depression may enrol study discretion investigator . Patient take investigational product within 4 week prior prestudy ( screen ) visit . The 4 week window derive date last dose study drug previous study prestudy/screening visit current study . Patient history illness , opinion study investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk subject participation study include , limited , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , osteoporosis , well poorly control concomitant condition include obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , chronic sinusitis/rhinitis . Students employee direct supervision investigator protocol eligible participate . Patient significant unexplained abnormality physical examination and/or laboratory safety test Visit 1 . Patient blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg systolic &gt; 95 mm Hg diastolic &gt; 2 measurement do &gt; 5 minute apart Visit 1 Visit 2 . Patient ECG abnormality consistent previous myocardial infarction , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , ischemic heart disease conduction system disease . Patient evidence illness would require treatment excluded medication , could immediately life threatening ( e.g. , arrhythmias , congenital heart disease ) , would pose restriction participation successful completion study , would pose additional risk administer montelukast patient . History intubation due asthma within last five ( 5 ) year . FEV1 &lt; 45 % predicted Hospitalization within previous 6 month Patient major surgery , donate lose 1 unit blood ( approximately 500 mL ) within 8 week prior prestudy ( screen ) visit . m. Patient history significant multiple and/or severe allergy medication use ( potentially use ) study ( include albuterol , montelukast , prednisone , acetaminophen , lidocaine , fentanyl , atropine , midazolam well latex ) , anaphylactic reaction significant intolerability market investigational prescription nonprescription drug food . Patient history stroke , chronic seizure , major neurological disorder . Patient history neoplastic disease . Patient female ≤8 week postpartum breast feed infant . Patient pregnant determine initial serum βHCG obtain Visit 1 , become pregnant study determine urine pregnancy test subsequent Visits ( # 25 ) , intend become pregnant time course study . Patient implant mechanically , electrically magnetically activated device metal body remove , include limited : pacemaker , neurostimulators , biostimulators , implanted insulin pump , aneurysm clip , bioprosthesis , artificial limb , metallic fragment foreign body , shunt , surgical staple ( include clip metallic suture ) and/or ear implant . Patient unable perform breath hold spirometry maneuver tolerate immobilization within MRI scanner . Patient consumes excessive amount alcohol , define great 3 glass alcoholic beverage ( 1 glass approximately equivalent : beer [ 284 mL/10 ounce ] , wine [ 125 mL/4 ounce ] , distilled spirit [ 25 mL/1 ounce ] ) per day .
