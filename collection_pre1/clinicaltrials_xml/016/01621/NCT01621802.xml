	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Safety Study GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' Combined Measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) Vaccine Subjects Four Six Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GSK Biologicals ' MMR vaccine ( Priorix® ) Merck 's MMR vaccine ( M-M-R®II ) refer Inv_MMR vaccine Com_MMR vaccine respectively . 2 lot comparator vaccine ( Com_MMR_L1 Com_MMR_L2 ) use , 2 lot analyse pool . The Inv_MMR vaccine administer second dose child already receive first dose Com_MMR vaccine . Since second dose MMR vaccine US routinely co-administered DTaP-IPV vaccine ( Kinrix® ) varicella vaccine ( VV ) ( ProQuad® Varivax® ) , child receive one dose vaccine along either MMR vaccine .</detailed_description>
