	<brief_summary>S-1 also show effective drug palliative chemotherapy Eastern Western GC patient . Recently , case small-sized study report lacrimal drainage obstruction ( LDO ) cause S-1.Suggested mechanism LDO involve direct secretion S-1 tear ; thus concentration S-1 metabolite tear expect high patient develop LDO patient without LDO . We investigate concentration S-1 metabolite tear plasma find correlation side effect LDO . These result also help u identify patient high risk develop S-1-associated side effect .</brief_summary>
