	<brief_summary>This project involve look time provide pain relief patient lung surgery via use small camera insert chest scope ( Video assist thorascopy ) . This procedure source intense pain immediately procedure long term lead chronic pain problem . Local anaesthetic place paravertebral space locate adjacent spinal column , pain nerve fibre locate , well recognize method provide pain relief procedure . It currently unclear best timing provide type pain relief centre place local anaesthetic start procedure end . Placing high volume local anaesthetic area start case may provide good short long term pain relief place end procedure . The investigator hope show difference two timing allow well pain relief procedure . This would feasibility study would lead onto multicentre trial eventually create best practice protocol pain relief lung resection via surgical method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Use Paravertebral Blocks Pain Relief Video Assisted Lung Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive general anaesthetic VATS procedure full AAGBI monitoring WHO surgical safety checklist perform appropriately prior skin incision . Induction anaesthesia standardise use propofol patient paralyse use muscle relaxant atracurium . The amount give anaesthetist 's discretion dependent patient . Fentanyl 2.5 mcg/kg use induction anaesthesia . A double lumen endotracheal tube place lung isolation perform necessary surgery . Anaesthesia maintain use volatile agent target control infusion propofol depend preference anaesthetist . The patient position laterally operative side . All patient receive simple intra-operative analgesia form 1 gram intravenous paracetamol diclofenac unless patient 70 abnormal renal function . Extra opioid analgesia give intravenous morphine titrate anaesthetist . The amount give documented part trial data . Patients warm maintain temperature 36 37 degree Celsius use warm blanket warm intravenous fluid . Anti-emetics form ondansetron 4 mg dexamethasone 4 mg also give unless contraindication . Prior surgical incision patient group receive 1mg/kg 0.25 % bupivicaine divide 3 PV injection fifth tenth thoracic vertebra . Only trained anaesthetist experience 30 PV insertion perform injection . The landmark technique injection follow : The spinous process thoracic vertebra palpate anaesthetist , 20 gauge needle insert 2.5 cm lateral advance perpendicularly vertical sagittal plane transverse process contact . The needle walk superior border transverse process , advance 1 cm one third weight determine local anaesthetic deliver careful aspiration . Both group PV catheter place start procedure bolus give straight away . As double-blinded trial anaesthetist know whether bolus local anaesthetic saline solution . Pharmacy research site provide 2 premade syrinx contain either local anaesthetic saline . The content syringe unknown anaesthetist label simply number 1 2 give order early ( 1 ) late ( 2 ) bolus . If clinically require obtain information give record immediately available pharmacy . The syrinx make neat 0.25 % bupivicaine 0.9 % Normal Saline solution . The equivalent volume 1mg/kg 0.25 % bupivicaine inject bolus . Both group also receive 0.25mg/kg 0.25 % bupivicaine intercostal block closing infusion 0.1 % bupivicaine commence 20mls/hr continue post operative period . Intra-operatively amount local anaesthetic give maximum dose 2 mg/kg . The maximum dose reach even infusion commences due fact time pass . The primary outcome measure use review pain score use VAS coughing . This start arrival recovery room , described time zero . It review time 1,2,4,6,12 24 hour . The pain score routinely measure nurse type surgery , difference study score measure often , timer place patient indicate score take . Secondary outcome measure include morphine consumption , note peri-operatively time interval describe . These recorded recovery staff initially continue ward nurse support research team . Other secondary outcome measure include cortisol level follow day , allow review neuroendocrine response . The patient routine blood test morning surgery ; cortisol level added test subject extra blood take . Patient satisfaction score record form questionnaire record first 2 post-operative day . The length hospital stay , readmission 30 day , survival 30 day infection rate also note .</detailed_description>
