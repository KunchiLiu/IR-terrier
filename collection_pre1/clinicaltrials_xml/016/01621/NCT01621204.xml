	<brief_summary>This study investigate eltrombopag use instead Intravenous Immune Globulin ( IVIG ) patient ITP , adequately raise platelet count undergo minor major surgery . Eltrombopag daily , oral pill approve treatment ITP . IVIG blood product frequently use treat ITP . Patients ITP need surgery get treatment increase platelet count . IVIG commonly use purpose eltrombopag may effective convenient patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Eltrombopag Intravenous Immune Globulin Before Surgery Immune Thrombocytopenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterize presence platelet autoantibody , low platelet count increase risk bleeding . TPO receptor agonist stimulate platelet production show remarkably effective ITP . Their use short-term mean elevate platelet count preparation surgical procedure yet adequately evaluate . Many patient moderate severe ITP ( platelet count le 50 x 10exp9/L ) stable platelet count bleed ; however , surgery invasive procedure become necessary , additional treatment often required increase platelet count achieve adequate hemostasis . Although specific guideline surgical platelet count threshold ITP lacking , platelet transfusion guideline recommend platelet count 50 - 100 x10exp9/L vast majority surgical procedure ; 50x10exp9/L typical threshold minor surgery like tooth extraction endoscopy ; 100x10exp9/L use major surgery like cardiac surgery neurosurgery . Commonly , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) use rapidly increase platelet count ITP patient invasive procedure . IVIG associate transient platelet count response approximately 80 % patient , occurs within 2 - 4 day . In patient , platelet count remain elevated approximately 4 week , allow enough time complete procedure adequate post-operative hemostasis . However , IVIG resource-intensive expensive blood product associate frequent side effect . Eltrombopag small molecule , non-peptide thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonist indicate treatment thrombocytopenia patient chronic ITP insufficient response corticosteroid , immunoglobulin , splenectomy . TPO receptor agonist effective new class medication non-immunogenic agonist TPO receptor ( c-Mpl ) work increase platelet production ITP patient . In randomized controlled trial , eltrombopag maintenance therapy show raise platelet count 60 - 80 % ITP patient platelet count generally remain elevated long drug continue . Time response 1 - 2 week minimal need dose titration . Side effect eltrombopag observed clinical study include elevation liver enzyme ( approximately 10 % patient ) . The risk thrombosis bone marrow reticulin formation remain uncertain . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) involve 74 patient ( across approximately 8 center ) Canada . This study evaluate efficacy safety eltrombopag bridge therapy compare IVIG bridge therapy adult patient ITP require surgery . This study also evaluate bleeding , adverse event patient-reported treatment satisfaction use Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) . Patients stratify accord centre surgery type ( major vs. minor ) .</detailed_description>
