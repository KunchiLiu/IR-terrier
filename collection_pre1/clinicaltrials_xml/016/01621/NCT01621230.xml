	<brief_summary>The aim study measure effect bupivacaine administer via epidural catheter index motor blockade ascertain second stage labor . This randomized , double-blind , controlled trial design address primary research question : Does bupivacaine lengthen second stage labor ? The secondary research question : Is evidence motor blockade attributable bupivacaine second stage labor ? The investigator know prior study length second stage nulliparous woman deliver Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia 28 minute . The investigator hypothesize propose study epidural analgesia bupivacaine significantly increase baseline 28 minute 37 minute ( 33 % increase ) thus implicate motor blockade . Baseline data Bromage Breen score second stage well uterine contractility data available index motor blockade here-to-fore studied context . Currently Parkland Hospital , 82 % nulliparous woman undergo induction labor term receive continuous epidural infusion bupivacaine first second stage labor . Such woman identify admit scheduled induction Parkland . After informed consent obtain standard management labor induction provide . Those consented woman reach 8 cm cervical dilation randomize . Group I receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter second stage ( i.e . 10 cm dilation ) Group II receive fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter ( see study procedure ) . Both patient caregiver blind whether patient bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm fentanyl arm . To detect 33 % increase ( 28 minute 37 minute ) primary outcome investigator need total 310 woman enrol study ( 155 per arm ) . Assuming 30 % consent rate give approximately 1000 woman meet inclusion criterion year Parkland , investigator project study could complete 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nulliparous woman schedule labor induction Monday Friday consent study randomize one two arm : bupivacaine plus fentanyl epidural analgesia throughout labor delivery ( include second stage ) epidural bupivacaine plus fentanyl 8 cm cervical dilation fentanyl thereafter . From activation epidural analgesia 8 cm cervical dilation prevail standard epidural technique use Parkland Hospital use . Briefly , 19-ga multi-orifice epidural catheter place use 17-ga 3 ½cm Tuohy needle L3-L4 lumbar interspace . Lactated Ringers solution , 500-1000mL infused placement epidural catheter mitigate hypotension . A test dose use 1.5 % lidocaine 1:200,000 epinephrine , 3mL , give via epidural catheter . If test dose negative , initial bolus 0.25 % bupivacaine , 4-8mL , fentanyl 100mcg give via catheter . After secure epidural catheter patient place supine position anesthetic sensory level measure desired level T6-T8 . Once T6-T8 sensory block secure epidural infusion use 0.125 % bupivacaine 2mcg/mL fentanyl 10mL/hr start . At time epidural infusion epidural catheter may replace discretion anesthesia provider inadequate analgesia . Ephedrine phenylephrine give intravenously maternal hypotension define systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg decrease 20 % systolic blood pressure patient 's baseline . Randomization occur woman reach 8 cm cervical dilation . Envelopes contain cassette sequentially randomize Dr. McIntire give attend obstetrical anesthesiologist contain one two medication . Group I receive 100mL epidural cassette 0.125 % bupivacaine fentanyl 2mcg/mL infuse 10mL/hr . Group II receive 100mL cassette fentanyl 10mcg/mL ( infused 10mL/hr . Both group rate epidural infusion patient , nurse , obstetrician , anesthesia provider blind randomized treatment group . The Parkland Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) provide study drug . The patient may request 5mL bolus epidural infusion every 30 minute pain relief inadequate . The obstetrician also give patient either study group 25mg intravenous meperidine every hour two dos pain relief unsatisfactory . The study regimen continue spontaneous delivery infant time operative vaginal delivery cesarean delivery plan . At point study routine anesthesia care resume . The standard care management labor induction Parkland require continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring ( EFM ) well uterine contraction monitoring . The standard apply EFM internal transducer membrane rupture . Standard fetal monitor equip laptop computer use electronically store fetal heart rate uterine contraction data study . This permit qualification uterine contractility second stage labor . The Bromage Breen score motor blockade assess complete cervical dilation 30 , 60 , 90 minute thereafter . The score system follow : Score Criteria 1 . Unable move foot knee ( complete block ) 2 . Able move foot 3 . Just able move knees 4 . Detectable weakness hip flexion supine 5 . No weakness hip flexion 6 . Able perform partial knee bend Visual analog pain ( VAS ) score adequacy epidural analgesia 1-10 also assess time point use Bromage Breen score . Data collection include maternal demographic characteristic well antepartum intrapartum obstetrical feature . Condition infant birth base Apgar score umbilical artery blood pH , well neonatal outcome ascertain .</detailed_description>
