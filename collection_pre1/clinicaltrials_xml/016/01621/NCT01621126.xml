	<brief_title>Neuromonitoring During Latarjet Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study intra-operative event put nerve risk Latarjet procedure . By use neuromonitoring determine exactly potential nerve injury procedure , investigator able modify investigator step procedure , order decrease possibly even eliminate risk neurologic injury . Modifications surgical technique response event observe neuromonitoring would include reposition operative shoulder upper extremity , reposition remove retractor . The investigator believe would lead significant decrease incidence neurologic complication post-operatively . Since operation usually perform young , active patient , benefit reduce eliminate complication would far-reaching impact individual society . Above , investigator feel important patient safety initiative .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient two senior surgeon undergo Latarjet procedure shoulder instability consider inclusion study . Our patient receive prior approval insurance carrier cover neuromonitoring surgical procedure enrol . Relative contraindication transcranial electrical stimulation include : history seizure , significant brain trauma , cerebral edema mass effect , recent CVA , intracerebral device ( e.g. , shunt , aneurysmal clip ) , skull defect cardiac pacemaker . Patients condition include study .</criteria>
