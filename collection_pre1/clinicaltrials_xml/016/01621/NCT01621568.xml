	<brief_summary>Background : - Sunitinib drug approve treat various type cancer , include kidney cancer . However , approve treat cancer thymus . Sunitinib work block protein responsible cell division growth . Some protein find thymus cancer cell . Researchers want see sunitinib use treat advanced thymus cancer . It give people least one early chemotherapy treatment contain platinum . Objectives : - To see sunitinib safe effective treatment advance thymus cancer respond early treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance thymus cancer respond early treatment . - At least one previous cancer treatment must chemotherapy treatment contain platinum . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study tumor biopsy use check severity cancer . - Participants take sunitinib tablet day , morning . They take tablet daily 4 week , follow 2 week rest sunitinib . This 6-week period call cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Treatment cycle may repeat long tumor continue grow severe side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Platinum-based chemotherapy standard care advance unresectable thymoma thymic carcinoma . However 50 % patient may fail initial therapy therefore require second-line therapy . New therapeutic option need patient disease progression platinum-containing therapy . Results obtain protocol 12-C-0118 far show impressive clinical activity sunitinib patient recurrent thymic carcinoma objective response rate 23 % disease control rate 91 % unprecedented histology . Treatment dose 50 mg daily four week follow 2 week poorly tolerate . Twenty five 41 patient need dose reduction due development intolerable adverse event . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : - To evaluate objective response rate ( PR+CR ) sunitinib patient relapse refractory thymoma thymic carcinoma MAIN ELIGIBILITY : - Patients histologically confirm thymoma ( Group 1 ) thymic carcinoma previously treat least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen progressive disease prior study entry - Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion - Adequate renal , hepatic hematopoietic function - No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy biologic therapy within 28 day sunitinib DESIGN : - In first group ( Group 1 ) , sunitinib administer orally use continuous schedule 50 mg per day 4 week 2 week constitute 6-week cycle ( Schedule 4/2 ) disease progression development intolerable side-effects . - In second group ( Group 2 ) , sunitinib administer orally use continuous schedule 50 mg per day 2 week 1 week constitute 3-week cycle ( Schedule 2/1 ) disease progression development intolerable side-effects . - Toxicity assess every cycle CTCAE Version 4.0 - Tumor response assessment RECIST 1.1 criterion perform every cycle Group 1 every cycle Group 2 ( every 6 week ) patient receive treatment le one year , every two cycle Group 1 every four cycle Group 2 ( every 12 week ) patient receive treatment one year longer . -Exploratory study include evaluation serum VEGFR2 , PLGF , IL-4 , IL-12 , HGF , b-FGF ( Group 1 ) ; circulate tumor cell , endothelial progenitor , mature apoptotic endothelial cell ( group ) . In Group 2 , regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , exhaust CD8 T cell , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) , Th1/Th2 T cell population also evaluate . Where tumor sample available , intra-tumoral immune infiltrate assess ( group ) .</detailed_description>
