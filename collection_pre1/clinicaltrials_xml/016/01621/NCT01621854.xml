	<brief_summary>This two-part Phase I , open label , dose-escalation , study NUC-1031 single agent patient advance solid tumour fail respond relapse treatment standard therapy . NUC-1031 ProTide gemcitabine , drug use widely effectively cancers many year . Both NUC-1031 gemcitabine work prevent cancer cell divide attack DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . Non clinical study show NUC-1031 effective gemcitabine able reach cancer cell passive diffusion , less easily degrade cancer cell , delivers monophosphate form active agent . The first part study determine recommend phase 2 dose dose escalation second part explore preliminary anti-tumour activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-part , Phase I , open label study NUC-1031 single agent , administer IV weekly day 1 , 8 , &amp; 15 ( Schedule A ) twice weekly day 1 &amp; 5 , 8 &amp; 12 , 15 &amp; 19 ( Schedule B ) 28 day- cycle regimen . An initial dose-escalation phase ( Part I ) follow expansion cohort phase ( Part II ) use prefer regimen Part I . In Part I , sequential patient assign increase dos NUC-1031 standard ' 3 + 3 ' design determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) . There review available data ( particular safety profile preliminary PK data least last scheduled day Cycle 1 ) follow enrolment second cohort schedule A B select preferred administration schedule take forward ongoing evaluation . In Part II ( dose expansion ) additional patient enrol receive NUC-1031 RP2D dose frequency determine Part I study . During Part II , information obtain regard safety , PK , PD preliminary anti-tumour efficacy NUC-1031 RP2D . In part study , patient may continue receive NUC-1031 6 cycle , disease progression , long participant receive clinical benefit opinion CI , occurrence unmanageable drug relate toxicity despite dose modification study participant decline treatment .</detailed_description>
