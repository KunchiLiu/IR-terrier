	<brief_summary>Background : - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) chemical may help protect strengthen brain cell produce dopamine . Dopamine chemical affect brain function . People Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) problem produce dopamine brain . Researchers want see gene transfer help deliver GDNF area brain damage PD . The gene transfer study , call AAV2-GDNF , may help produce GDNF protect damage brain cell . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness AAV2-GDNF gene transfer advance PD . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance PD well control medication . Design : - Participants study 5 year . There 18 outpatient study visit 3-day stay hospital . There may also overnight stay followup visit . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . Tests PD symptom mood memory give . Imaging study use find right part brain infuse gene . The screening visit take place 60 day surgery . - Participants baseline visit month surgery . For 1 week baseline visit , participant keep diary motor problem . The visit involve movement test give take regular dose levodopa . - Participants surgery infuse AAV2-GDNF brain . The surgery also include lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) collect cerebrospinal fluid . After surgery , participant recover hospital least 2 day . - Participants another lumbar puncture 6 18 month surgery . This outpatient visit . - Participants regular followup visit surgery . These visit include neurological test movement study . Visits neurosurgeon take place 1 , 2 , 4 week surgery . Additional visit take place every 3 month first 3 year , long interval 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : While medication temporarily alleviate symptom Parkinson disease ( PD ) , influence degenerative process . Progressive loss nigral dopaminergic ( DA ) neuron ( pathological hallmark PD ) result progressive neurologic dysfunction death . Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) first identify base ability promote survival embryonic DA neuron vitro , research demonstrate beneficial effect GDNF animal model PD . Preliminary clinical trial GDNF infusion yield inconclusive result . Observed problem tolerability efficacy study may relate method delivery . Recent evidence indicate gene transfer via direct delivery viral vector may represent superior approach treatment PD GDNF . Study population : Twenty-four adult male female subject advance Parkinson disease , candidate surgical treatment Parkinson disease meet Inclusion Exclusion Criteria . Design : We propose Phase 1 single-center , open-label , dose escalation , safety tolerability study adeno-associated virus , serotype 2 vector ( AAV2 ) contain human GDNF complementary DNA . Bilateral catheter place surgically skull brain vector deliver convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) putamen ( 450 microliters per hemisphere ) 24 patient advanced PD . An additional 76 subject allow screening failure . Four escalate dose level evaluate follow dose cohort ( 6 patient per cohort ) : Cohort 1 = 9 x 10 ( 10 ) vg , Cohort 2 = 3 x 10 ( 11 ) vg , Cohort 3 = 9 x 10 ( 11 ) vg Cohort 4 = 3 x 10 ( 12 ) vg . Outcome measure : To assess safety , tolerability , potential clinical effect CED AAV2-GDNF advance PD patient , use define clinical evaluation PD ( Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale , Modified Schwab England Activities Daily Living scale , Hoehn Yahr Staging , Lang Fahn Dyskinesia Rating Scale , On-Off Patient Diary , Quality Life , Modified Rankin Scale , Adverse Event Log neurologic examination ) , laboratory study ( hematologic , immunologic chemistry ) , neuropsychological testing ( Mattis Dementia Rating Scale , Beck Depression Inventory II Parkinson Psychosis Questionnaire ) neuroimaging ( magnetic resonance image positron emission tomography ) .</detailed_description>
