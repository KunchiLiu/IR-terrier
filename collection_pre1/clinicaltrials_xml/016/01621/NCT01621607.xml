	<brief_summary>Background : - The risk become addict drug varies among individual , even use similar drug similar way . It known people become addicted others . Studies suggest gene may increase risk addiction . Negative life experience may also affect risk addiction . Researchers want test smoker nonsmoker study genetic brain function trait may lead drug addiction . Objectives : - To understand brain function people may high risk drug addiction . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 55 year age . - Smokers ( 10 30 cigarette per day 2 year ) nonsmoker eligible . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They test drug alcohol use . A blood sample collect . - The study involve one visit . Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - At visit , participant answer question health drug use habit . They train task MRI scan . After training , scan perform task . The scan task look brain function related reward impulsiveness . - Other computer test give scan . These test measure learning , memory , impulsiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Even similar drug use pattern , risk drug addiction varies individual individual . However , neurobiological mechanism underlie variability poorly understood characterize . Studies suggest certain trait observe substance dependent individual may actually precede drug use , could augur future substance dependence . Understanding presence trait increase vulnerability substance addiction could aid development early intervention , preventative measure , well well treatment strategy . Objective : The primary goal protocol improve understanding increased susceptibility develop substance addiction . We focus particular gene x environment interaction increase risk factor substance dependence . The emphasis monoaminergic neurotransmitter-related gene think influence adaptability environment , , therefore , cognitive domain related dopamine serotonin : reward punishment learning , impulse control . To achieve objective , study implement use cognitive , genetic neuroimaging test adult addict individual along match control . Subject Population : We focus adult ( 18-55 year old ) smoker match non-smoking control . Experimental Design : This study involve cognitive , pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) test between-subject design involve neuroimaging cognitive testing . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure BOLD fMRI activation behavioral performance various cognitive task deal impulse control reward learning , function gene x environment interaction .</detailed_description>
