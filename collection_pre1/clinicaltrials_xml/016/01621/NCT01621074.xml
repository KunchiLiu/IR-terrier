	<brief_summary>During endurance exercise heavy severe intensity domain , rate metabolite associate fatigue process ( e.g . Pi , ADP , H , extracellular K ) accumulate increase . possibly lead exercise cessation . Sodium bicarbonate , nutritional supplement , gain attention past decade , might delay offset fatigue . To date , controversial discussion delivery mode ( amount frequency ) might best optimize endurance performance . Since high ion load consequent multiple ingestion might increase plasma volume , consequently decrease bicarbonate concentration , single acute ingestion could beneficial . However , multi-day competition tournament might necessary use supplement daily basis . Here , investigator aim investigate effect single dose multiple dose ( five consecutive day ) administration bicarbonate vs. placebo increase endurance performance acid-base homeostasis train male endurance athlete .</brief_summary>
