	<brief_summary>Slip-related fall often cause injury ; often catastrophic consequence , even among healthy old person . Establishing retainable preventive train regimen slip-related fall would , without doubt , major public health implication .

	<brief_title>Motor Training Fall Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Slip-related fall often cause catastrophic injury frail healthy old person . Investigators show , motor training repeat exposure slip walk , young adult able traverse potential slip hazard without lose balance , regardless whether slip actually occur . It highly unlikely effect could attribute education heighten awareness slip threat alone . Furthermore , investigator demonstrate improved motor skill acquire single session retain 4-6 month longer upon re-testing , make intervention highly attractive . Of great interest , however , extent old adult acquire retain similar protective skill upon training . This tested date . Also unknown potential confounding factor older adult 's functional status might interact train . These issue importance establish retainable preventive train regimen slip-related fall would , without doubt , major public health implication . In study , investigator demonstrate old adult significantly reduce near-term risk backward balance loss fall motor training repeat exposure simulate slip intersperse no-slip trial . Investigators verify awareness observational learn alone substitute motor train awareness-control group . Investigators determine extent adaptive improvement retain course year . Finally , investigator verify although single slip exposure may yield retainable effect , intensity control group exhibit significantly less favorable long-term effect control center mass stability , body weight support , balance loss fall upon slip motor train group repeat slip . In addition , investigator expect intensity-control group also high self-reported incidence fall 12-month period motor train group multiple slip exposure .</detailed_description>
