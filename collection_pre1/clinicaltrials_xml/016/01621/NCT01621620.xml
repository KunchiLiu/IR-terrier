To determine whether hypertension baroreflex activation due blood pressure rise responsible analgesic effect acute hypertension . study question The study question derive study objective : 1 . Does sympatho-vagal balance influence pain perception ? 2 . Does sympatho-vagal balance influence diffuse noxious inhibitory control system ? 3 .

	<brief_title>The Role Sympatho-vagal Balance Different Limbs Pain Perception Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis We hypothesize activation sympathetic system , lead increased hypertension , rather cholinergic response increase BP , responsible antinociceptive effect hypertension . 2.b objective 1 . To study sympatho-vagal balance effect different limb pain perception . 2 . To determine whether hypertension baroreflex activation due blood pressure rise responsible analgesic effect acute hypertension . 2.c study question The study question derive study objective : 1 . Does sympatho-vagal balance influence pain perception ? 2 . Does sympatho-vagal balance influence diffuse noxious inhibitory control system ? 3 . Does sympatho-vagal balance influence temporal summation ? 4 . Does hypoalgesic effect acute increase blood pressure result baroreflex activation ? 3 . Subjects methods 3.a subject Every subject invite 2 separate session . At least 24 hour apart two session . The test session describe detail Hebrew protocol attach current protocol English . An informed consent sign subject prior thorough interview . The interview , compose several question regard prior health problem , current past use medication well demographic detail ( detailed Hebrew protocol ) take place test room prior begin first session . Screening test include detailed interview , blood pressure , heart rate ECG strip begin first ( second ) session . The first measurement take follow 15 minute complete rest . The second third 5 10 minute , respectively . Blood examination require study . Healthy subject : 20 age match subject ( 20-50 ) .</detailed_description>
