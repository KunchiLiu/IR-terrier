	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , common , genetically inherited disease , cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . This gene encode CFTR protein , express apical surface epithelial cell , many function , important think ion transport . Abnormal ion transport lead thick secretion airway , infection , inflammation eventually irreversible lung damage . There currently treatment halt natural progression disease ; available successful therapy merely slow rate decline clinical condition . To date , viral gene transfer agent retain efficacy upon repeat administration . Our study ass safety efficacy lipid-mediated vector harbour normal CFTR gene repeat nebulised administration . We complete single dose safety study evaluate safety gene expression single dose pGM169/GL67A administer nose lung individual cystic fibrosis . This trial randomise 130-patients receive either gene product ( pGM169/GL67A ) encode CFTR placebo double-blinded fashion . All subject receive 12 dos nebulised gene therapy interval 4 week 48 week period . After dose 12 2 formal follow visit , 14 28 day post-dose . In addition , patient follow long-term . Subgroups patient enrol gene expression measurement nose ( least n=20 ) low airway via bronchoscopy ( least n=20 ) . The primary outcome trial evaluate relative change predict Forced Expiratory Volume 1-second ( FEV1 ) 12-doses . Secondary outcome measure assess efficacy gene product ( assessment patient ' physiological function , serological index , radiological appearance lung self-reported assessment quality life ) , degree gene expression product safely .</detailed_description>
