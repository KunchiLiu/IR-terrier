	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment also major risk factor development dementia later life . Findings study suggest carotenoid , lutein zeaxanthin may important cognitive function elderly . The investigator previously report eggs highly bioavailable source lutein zeaxanthin . Our study evaluate long-term egg intervention treatment strategy age-related cognitive impairment could possibly prevent onset dementia . The investigator also show lutein supplementation significantly improve verbal fluency score healthy old woman . Our study show egg intervention significantly increase serum lutein concentration old adult . Based sum finding , next logical step investigate ability lutein zeaxanthin contain eggs influence cognitive function old adult . The investigator hypothesize significant increase cognitive function measure old adult provide meal contain 2 egg/day end 6 month , significant improvement observe old adult give daily meal contain egg substitute . The propose study design randomize , placebo control trial test effect 6 month supplementation 2 eggs/day cognitive function old adult . Secondary analysis determine whether baseline MP density predict relative effectiveness intervention cognitive function . Secondary outcome include plasma biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design placebo control trial test effect 6 month supplementation 2 egg 4 ounce egg substitute day cognitive function old adult . Subjects randomly assign one two group . Secondary analysis determine whether baseline macular pigment density ( non invasive measure lutein zeaxanthin neural tissue ) choline status predict relative effectiveness intervention cognitive function . Secondary outcome include plasma biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation , choline bioavailability , genetic variant relate endogenous choline production . Participants recruit community-dwelling men woman age &gt; 50 yr , potential participant screen meet cognitive functional criterion . Participants pre-screened telephone ; appear meet criterion undergo screen . The study include baseline ( 0 month ) , 3 6 month visit study procedure , monthly telephone call . Given visible difference two intervention ( egg , egg substitute ) , blind study possible .</detailed_description>
