	<brief_title>T-Cell Replete Haploidentical Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Plus Natural Killer ( NK ) Cell Transplantation Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Relapsed Refractory Despite Previous Allogeneic Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refractory hematologic malignancy , include develop recurrent disease allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation , dismal prognosis . Historically , regimen-related mortality disease recurrence significant cause treatment failure heavily pre-treated patient population . Our institution utilize mismatch family member ( haploidentical ) donor patient number year follow reason : ( 1 ) Only 30 % patient match related donor available ; ( 2 ) transplantation perform rapidly since time unrelated donor transplantation average 3 4 month ; ( 3 ) curative treatment option available . These therapeutic intervention largely successful give dismal prognosis patient group ; however disease recurrence remain significant cause treatment failure . To provide maximum benefit challenge population , goal therapeutic transplant protocol include : ( 1 ) conditioning regimen well tolerate , even heavily pre-treated population ; also provide substantial antileukemia effect , ( 2 ) establish rapid immune recovery patient may benefit graft versus leukemia effect early protection life threaten infection also limit dangerous counter-productive graft versus host disease . The primary aim protocol evaluate one-year survival significantly improve group patient receive T-cell replete haploidentical donor HCT novel clofarabine , cytarabine , busulfan , plerixafor , cyclophosphamide , ATG base reduce intensity condition regimen whose hematologic malignancy relapse refractory prior allogeneic transplant . Toxicity evaluate rate transplant relate mortality rate moderate severe graft versus host disease day 100 . The investigator also describe event-free , disease-free survival one year , well rate hematopoietic recovery donor engraftment . Additionally , investigator study comprehensively immune reconstitution follow T-cell replete haploidentical transplantation . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - Evaluate one-year survival significantly improve group child receive therapeutic regimen high-risk hematologic malignancy relapse refractory despite previous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) use novel reduce intensity condition T-cell replete haploidentical donor hematopoietic stem cell plus NK cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Estimate incidence malignant relapse , event-free survival , disease free survival ( DFS ) one-year post-transplantation . - Estimate incidence severity acute chronic ( GVHD ) . - Estimate rate transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) first 100 day transplantation .</detailed_description>
