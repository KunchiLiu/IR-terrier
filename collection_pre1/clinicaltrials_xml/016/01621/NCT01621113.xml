	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Dalfampridine Locomotor Training Chronic , Motor Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research suggest combine therapy could result important gain restore function improve quality life person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Locomotor train activity-dependent rehabilitation therapy provide repetitive step facilitate manual assistance body weight support treadmill . Recent study report improvement walk stand individual motor incomplete SCI undergone intensive standardize locomotor training therapy . Extended release dalfampridine ( also know fampridine 4-aminopyridine [ 4-AP ] ) broad spectrum potassium channel blocker show animal study increase conduction action potential demyelinate axon . Dalfampridine recently approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment improve walk person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Demyelination also prominent feature incomplete SCI contribute clinical presentation person injury . The purpose study determine efficacy , safety , tolerability treatment dalfampridine combination locomotor training person chronic , motor incomplete SCI . We hypothesize person undergo combination therapy dalfampridine locomotor training show significantly great improvement walk speed measure SCI function receive locomotor train alone .</detailed_description>
