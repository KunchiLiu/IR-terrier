	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate comparative bioavailability two fix dose combination tablet formulation amlodipine losartan healthy volunteer . Subjects receive follow three treatment administer randomized three-way crossover design : reference treatment consist 5mg amlodipine tablet 100mg losartan tablet ; fix dose combination tablet consist 5mg amlodipine 100mg losartan ; another fix dose combination tablet consist 5mg amlodipine 100mg losartan ; three treatment administer orally fast state . Serial blood sample obtain pre-defined timepoints pharmacokinetic analysis amlodipine , losartan carboxylic acid ( primary active losartan metabolite ) . Safety assessment include measurement orthostatic vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , collection adverse event ( AE ) clinical laboratory test .</brief_summary>
