	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Anti-Endoglin Monoclonal Antibody TRC105 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TRC105 ( anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 ) combine bevacizumab patient population . ( Phase I ) II . To assess safety adverse event TRC105 combination bevacizumab patient population . ( Phase II ) III . To determine efficacy TRC105 combination bevacizumab recurrent glioblastoma measure progression-free survival compare efficacy bevacizumab alone patient population . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess proportion patient , progression free 6 month , treat TRC105 combination bevacizumab compare bevacizumab alone . ( Phase II ) II . To assess overall survival patient treat TRC105 combination bevacizumab compare bevacizumab alone . ( Phase II ) III . To compare impact treatment patient quality life ( QOL ) use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C15-Palliative Care ( PAL ) QLQ-brain neoplasm ( BN ) 20 Patient Questionnaires . ( Phase II ) IV . To estimate patient recommendation study participation others use Was It Worth It ( WIWI ) Questionnaire . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics TRC105 . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate immunogenicity TRC105 . ( Phase I ) III . To determine relationship tumor biomarkers , circulate biomarkers vascular response vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) /VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) predict efficacy and/or toxicity treatment . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess utility magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image include apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) predictor response survival . ( Phase II ) V. To assess utility dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI predictor response bevacizumab without TRC105 . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 , follow randomized phase II study . Phase I ( close accrual 1/14/14 ) : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV 1-4 hour day 8 11 course 1 day 1 8 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Phase II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV 1-4 hour day 8 11 course 1 day 1 8 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
