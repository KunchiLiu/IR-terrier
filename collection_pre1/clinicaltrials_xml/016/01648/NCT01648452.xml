	<brief_summary>Background : - Achromatopsia inherited condition cause vision loss cell retina work properly . It cause loss acuity , sensitivity light , loss color vision . There effective treatment achromatopsia . - Four gene currently know cause achromatopsia . One , cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 3 ( CNGB3 ) gene , cause 50 percent people . - CNTF natural chemical find body promotes survival function nerve cell . CNTF show effective treat retinal disease animal slow vision loss . - CNTF also study 250 people retinal disease achromatopsia . In study , CNTF implant place eye simple surgery . The implant release CNTF inside eye , near retina . These study suggest CNTF implant might help vision eye disease . Objectives : - To learn whether CNTF implant safe people CNGB3 achromatopsia . - To learn whether CNTF improve visual acuity color vision , whether may reduce sensitivity light people CNGB3 achromatopsia . Eligibility : You may able take part study : - Are least 18 year old . - Test positive mutation CNGB3 gene mutation another achromatopsia gene . - Have 20/100 vision bad least one eye . - Are pregnant nursing . Design : - To determine take part , ask medical history physical examination eye examination . Blood urine sample take . - This study require 11 visit National Eye Institute 3 year . - One visit implant surgery . The implant place one eye . - Study visit take place 1 day implant surgery , 1 week later 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 1.5 year 3 year later . These visit help u evaluate safety benefit implant eye . - At 3 year visit , choose keep CNTF implant eye , u remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study evaluate safety ocular NT-501 device encapsulate NT-201 cell release Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor ( CNTF ) retina participant affect CNGB3 achromatopsia . Study Population : Five participant affect CNGB3 achromatopsia enrol , one eye treat per participant . Design : This Phase I/II , prospective , single-center study . One eye participant receive vitreous NT-501 device implant release CNTF . The study complete final participant receive three year follow-up . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number severity adverse event systemic ocular toxicity six month post-implantation . Additional safety ocular CNTF implant participant CNGB3 achromatopsia determine assessment retinal function , ocular structure occurrence adverse event time point . Secondary outcome include change visual function include visual acuity color vision , electroretinogram ( ERG ) responses , retinal image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible , follow inclusion criterion must meet , applicable . Participant must 18 year age old . Participant must carry two allele CNGB3 gene mutation cyclic nucleotidegated channel alpha 3 ( CNGA3 ) sequence variation confirm Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify laboratory . Participant must understand sign protocol inform consent . Both female participant childbearing potential male participant able father child must ( partner ) hysterectomy vasectomy , completely abstinent intercourse , must agree use contraception first six month follow implantation . Acceptable form contraception include : hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method ( diaphragm , condom ) spermicide , surgical sterilization ( tubal ligation ) . A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present . Participant history ocular disease likely contribute significantly visual loss ( e.g. , optic neuropathy , glaucoma , uveitis , retinal disease ) . Participant judge investigator sufficiently healthy safely undergo ophthalmic surgery . Participant anticoagulant therapy safely stop perioperatively implant procedure . Patients warfarin always exclude . Patients aspirin ask stop medication least seven day prior surgery ( contraindicate underlie medical condition ) . The stoppage period anticoagulant medication base best clinical judgment investigator surgeon variable depend patient 's medical condition type medication . Participant diagnosis treatment malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within previous five year . Participant receive investigational treatment another clinical study relate ocular condition last six month . Participant pregnant , lactate plan become pregnant first six month follow implantation . Study Eye Eligibility Criteria : The participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . Study Eye The study eye must bestcorrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity letterscore ≤ 53 ( i.e. , ≤ 20/100 ) . The visual acuity first baseline visit ( Baseline 1 ) use eligibility determination case change visual acuity second baseline visit ( Baseline 2 ) . Study Eye The study eye choroidal nevus ocular neoplasm potential risk malignant transformation . The study eye judge investigator , base history examination finding , highrisk retinal detachment , vitreous hemorrhage , infection , uveitis . The study eye lens , cornea , medium opacity preclude adequate visualization test retina . The study eye undergone intraocular surgery within 12 month prior enrollment . Study Eye Selection Criteria Cases Bilateral Disease : As genetic condition usually affect eye similar degree , eye participant meet study eye eligibility criterion comparable visual acuity , study eye select investigator 's medical judgment consultation participant . In case eye lower visual acuity , eye select study eye .</criteria>
