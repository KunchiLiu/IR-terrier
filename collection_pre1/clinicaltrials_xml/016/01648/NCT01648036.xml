	<brief_summary>Life-threatening infection account 10 % intensive care unit admission constitute second frequent cause death ICU heart diseases . The common cause death patient admit life-threatening infection multi-organ failure mediate severe inflammation . Given relationship inflammation blood clotting , blood-thinners ( also call anticoagulant ) use decrease inflammation formation small clot . Several line evidence suggest heparin , proven inexpensive blood-thinner , may reduce improve survival patient diagnose life-threatening infection . The primary objective study demonstrate feasibility enrol patient large randomize controlled trial investigate heparin patient severe infection . In study , patient life-threatening infection equal chance receive intravenous infusion heparin , low dose similar drug prevent blood clot patient immobile . The primary purpose study demonstrate average 2 patient per site , per month , enrol . Other measure feasibility include consent rate , number protocol violation occur trial , number dose reduction need due excessive anticoagulation . To study biologic effect heparin patient severe infection , specific laboratory marker measure analyze . If feasibility trial confirm , large randomize trial design tell heparin safely improve survival conduct . Given low cost availability , heparin show improve survival patient severe infection , adoption therapy global scale anticipate .</brief_summary>
