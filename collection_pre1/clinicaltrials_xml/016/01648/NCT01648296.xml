	<brief_summary>A single center , open-label baseline control imaging study design ass whether Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) measurements myocardial Fatty Acid ( FA ) metabolism perform [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx correlate measurement use [ 11C ] palmitate . This study involve investigational use PET radioactive tracer , fluorine-18 radiolabeled fatty acid analog , [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx design measure beta oxidation fatty acid myocardium . The investigator propose evaluate feasibility method heart failure patient dilate non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) without type-2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) obese subject ( Body Mass Index ≥ 30kg/m2 ) without T2DM normal healthy subject provide wide range perturbation myocardial FA metabolism . Specific objective include : 1 . To assess diagnostic quality [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx PET image kinetics propose 10 millicurie ( mCi ) dose . 2 . To quantitatively determine relationship PET measurement myocardial FA metabolism obtain [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx use [ 11C ] Palmitate . 3 . To calculate human dosimetry base human biodistribution [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx . 4 . Correlate measurement myocardial FA metabolism change leave ventricular ( LV ) structure function perform clinically indicate echocardiography 6-9 month image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PET image broken 2 group subject ( dosimetry kinetic dynamic imaging/ [ 11C ] palmitate comparison ) entry group occur simultaneously . All PET image perform Siemens Biograph 40 PET-CT scanner . All patient undergo routine clinical evaluation dictate treat heart failure cardiologist . The result PET study provide patient treat cardiologist unless , judgment Principal Investigator , image demonstrate unsuspected abnormality may warrant evaluation . Subjects instruct eat midnight night study . However , patient instruct continue heart failure diabetic medical regimen . The morning PET study , subject two intravenous catheter place . One place arm purpose administer radioactive tracer ( [ 15O ] Water , [ 11C ] Palmitate , [ 18F ] FluorbetaOx ) , draw blood sample safety laboratory analysis . Urine sample obtain along Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign . A follow-up telephone contact do 2-3 day post imaging study capture unanticipated serious adverse event ( SAEs ) .</detailed_description>
