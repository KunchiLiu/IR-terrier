	<detailed_description>D0 : Visit inclusion randomization After end chemoradiotherapy , patient see consultation / surgeon propose participate study . At end visit patient agree participate , investigator center conduct collection write consent inclusion patient . Inclusion record e-CRF investigator center . Randomization ( 7 11 week delay ) perform surgeon via software module Cleanweb randomization . M1- 1.5 M2.5 depend group randomisation A consultation surgeon hold within 15 day ( +/- 5 day ) intervention check clinical response ( tumor regression rectal tumor distance dentate line ) planify surgery . During visit , surgeon note e-CRF , clinical finding lesion result investigation . Not specific exam request study . M2 M3 Surgical procedure : The anesthesia consultation plan surgery accord habit service . Participation study alter anesthetic procedures.The patient admit day surgery surgical ward . During surgery , operate data provide e-CRF ( digital rectal examination general anesthesia , type surgery ( anterior resection abdominal-perineal resection ) , operative time , intraoperative bleeding , macroscopic appearance mesorectum , distance distal limit resection ) . The postoperative complication note surgeon e-CRF hospitalization ( 10-15 day ) , data report pathological ( Annex 2 ) . Pathological examination specimen proctectomy perform accord recommendation clinical practice use standard form ( Annex 2 ) . The tumor response evaluate inclusion residual tumor response chemoradiotherapy grade scale Rodel ( Annex 5 ) . A double reading slide make patient two independent pathologist blind randomization group patient . M2 - M5 M3 - M6 : Postoperative follow-up : Following intervention , specific consultation necessary . At follow-up consultation ( 1 month , 3 month ) surgeon evaluate postoperative course , planify stoma closure , note potential adverse event result morphological examination ( compute tomography , ultrasound , endoscopy ) biological ( marker ) eventually prescribe . M6 - M60 : Cancer surveillance : Regular follow-up every 3-4 month fo first two year every 6 month last remaining 3 year ( clinical examination , CT-scan biological marker ( CEA ) )</detailed_description>
