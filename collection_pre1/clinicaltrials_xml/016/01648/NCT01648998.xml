	<brief_summary>Stimulating mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) may restore disturbed balance see depression . In double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial investigator test effect single dose ( 500mg ) fludrocortisone , MR-agonist , information processing healthy female volunteer ( N = 2x20 ) . The investigator want investigate whether acute administration fludrocortisone ( FC ) healthy female enhances appraisal emotional information relate depression , hypothesizing : - FC relative placebo selectively improve recognition happy fearful face : result correct response faster RTs . - FC induces bias towards positive self-description improved memory positive information . Female participant select haplotype MRI180V related depression vulnerability woman , men . If effect fludrocortisone comparable effect antidepressant test population , might first indication fludrocortisone may function antidepressant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We find depressed individual , compare non-depressed control , MRs decrease ( approximately -30 % ) expression hippocampus , inferior frontal gyrus cingulate gyrus . It propose decreased expression MRs part underlie pathological process depression . Recent study reveal considerable interpersonal difference regard function MRs. Firstly , common MR gene polymorphism influence cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) . Secondly , clinical population differ observed depressive symptom function MRI180V genotype . This MR I180V gene variant show less activity vitro , suggest functionality vivo decrease . Finally , MR haplotype 2 , prevalent 35 % Caucasian population , enhance transcription , translation transactivation MR . This haplotype associate high dispositional optimism , few thought hopelessness low risk major depression . These effect restrict pre-menopausal woman . This suggest female sex steroid may interact MR gene , thereby modulate resilience . Indeed , show progesterone oestrogen modulate MR-expression rat . Taken together , mineralocorticoid receptor brain consider new target treatment stress related disorder like depression . Fludrocortisone ( 9Î± fluoro-hydrocortisone ) ( FC ) specific MR-agonist currently use treat disease adrenal cortex , septic shock ( Russel , 2008 ) occasionally orthostatic hypotension . It show FC significantly inhibit nocturnal HPA axis activity without first deplete MR receptor MR-antagonist . This suggest FC interesting implication disorder HPA axis excess , depression . Consistent idea stimulation MR might useful treatment depression , fludrocortisone accelerate antidepressant effect SSRI escitalopram , least patient respond escitalopram . This line previous observation spironolactone , MR antagonist , decrease efficacy antidepressant amitriptyline depress patient . These study show stimulation MR might useful addition treatment depression . Though , explanatory mechanism behind observation remains unclear . This project first step investigate potential antidepressant effect MR stimulation fludrocortisone . We test effect FC indices emotional information processing healthy volunteer , recently validate model antidepressant drug action . It demonstrate repeatedly single dose antidepressant change process emotionally relevant information healthy volunteer , within hour administration . For instance , one dose citalopram improve recognition facial expression fear happiness relative placebo healthy female volunteer . This finding replicate different antidepressant different population .</detailed_description>
