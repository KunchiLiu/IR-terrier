	<brief_title>Vaginal Estrogen Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy Women With Symptomatic Mild Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathogenesis pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) unknown . Few study correlate patient symptom amount prolapse biomarkers . POP traditionally manage pessary surgery . Recent study suggest reduction POP symptom follow Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy ( PFPT ) . Vaginally deliver hormone also commonly use treat prolapse symptom , little evidence support clinical benefit . The investigator hypothesize optimal approach improve prolapse symptom patient mild prolapse require re-alignment strengthen levator muscle via PFPT , optimization tissue integrity via local estrogen therapy . The investigator propose test hypothesis randomize control trial woman symptomatic mild prolapse opt PFPT , receive treatment PFPT combination vaginal estrogen versus placebo . The investigator predict combine approach lead decrease symptom improve anatomical support corroborate biomarker data .</detailed_description>
