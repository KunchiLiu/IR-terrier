	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion commonly perform critically ill patient , particularly oncologic patient . However , many study report adverse effect intervention final data benefit available . There prospective study oncologic patient regard red blood cell transfusion requirement . There observational experimental study suggest bad outcome include high rate infection clinical complication , maybe high cancer recurrence , patient submit red blood transfusion . Hemoglobin level around 9 g/dL usually recommend although base evidence . The investigator purpose prospectively evaluate two strategy transfusion 400 patient cancer admit intensive care unit severe clinical condition : liberal strategy - patient receive blood transfusion hemoglobin low 9 g/dL since admission ICU ICU discharge ; restrictive strategy - patient receive blood transfusion hemoglobin low 7 g/dL . Clinical outcome , cost quality life compare .</detailed_description>
