	<brief_title>A Study Explore Utility Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) Compared With Methacholine Challenge ( MCC ) Testing Assessment Patients With Suspected But Undiagnosed Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Overview : The measurement exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) clinical test measure airway inflammation perform consistently accurately clinical practice point-of-care . Airway inflammation recognize central mechanism pathogenesis asthma . The measurement FeNO NIOX MINO® device provide rapid , noninvasive , inexpensive tool ass airway inflammation inflammatory airway diseases asthma . The test easy perform require minimal training operator conduct test . Role Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) : FeNO evolve predictive prognostic biomarker airway inflammation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas produce epithelial cell bronchial wall intrinsic part inflammatory process . Measuring amount FeNO useful initial assessment patient chronic cough non-specific respiratory symptom suggestive asthma , management patient establish asthma receive corticosteroid treatment . Intended Use : NIOX MINO® measure Nitric Oxide ( NO ) human breath . Nitric Oxide frequently increase inflammatory process asthma . The fractional NO concentration expire breath ( FeNO ) measure NIOX MINO® assurance measurement repeatable accord guideline NO measurement establish American Thoracic Society . Rationale Study : The burden asthma U.S. significant grow . In addition , establish asthma over- under- diagnose . Equally concern fact nearly 75 % misdiagnosed patient receive anti-asthma treatment . Data point need simple , inexpensive reliable way establish diagnosis asthma . Presently , assessment patient suspect undiagnosed asthma perform Methacholine Challenge ( MCC ) test evaluate airway hyperresponsiveness . However , MCC , test difficult , time-consuming , costly also involve level risk patient . Nonetheless , evidence FeNO testing may able identify patient actually asthma among suspect undiagnosed asthma normal pulmonary function test , thus potentially eliminate need MCC test many patient . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES To explore utility FeNO compare MCC assess patient suspect undiagnosed asthma . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN This exploratory , multi-center , single-visit , outpatient study . Approximately 50 subject participate study ( approximately 8-16 week study enrollment period : - Demographics - Physical Characteristics - Smoking history ( cigarette ) - FeNO - Spirometry - Asthma Allergy Specialists MCC Test Procedure Subject discharge study : Once information collect procedure perform , subject discharge clinic study participation complete Medical device : The NIOX MINO® initially clear FDA March 4 , 2008 new hand-held device measurement exhale Nitric Oxide , marker eosinophilic airway inflammation . The recent clearance FDA September 2 , 2010 Instrument ( 09-1100 ) , use study . NIOX MINO® use child 7-17 year age adults 18 year age older initial assessment management asthma . The NIOX MINO® 10 second test base exhale breath measure 50 ml/second flow rate . Results provide point care within 2 minute successful completion breath test . The test influence patient effort variation clinician 's test technique . Definitions : Adverse event : Any incident use medical device ( include vitro diagnostics ) suspect resulted adverse outcome patient . Serious Injury mean injury illness : - Is life-threatening - Results permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure , - Necessitates medical surgical intervention preclude permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure . Malfunction : failure device meet performance specification otherwise perform intend . Caused contribute : death serous injury may attribute medical device , medical device may factor death serious injury , include event occur result : - Failure - Malfunction - Improper inadequate design - Manufacture - Labeling - User error</detailed_description>
