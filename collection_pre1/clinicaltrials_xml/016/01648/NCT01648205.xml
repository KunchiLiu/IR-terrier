	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether late sodium channel blockade might effective shorten QTc interval various LQT3 mutation consider safe therapeutic option LQT3 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Sodium Channel Blocker LQT3 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LQT3 mutation LQTS Registry study use vitro expression study determine whether ranolazine cause decrease late sodium current , slow recovery inactivation and/or change time course inactivation , ameliorate causative functional effect individual mutation . Individuals select LQT3 mutation already study vitro invite participate short term ( 2 day ) study Clinical Research Center study effect oral dose ranolazine QTc duration ECG , echocardiogram Holter-derived parameter . The individual , well individual mutation , invited participate 6-month study involve ranolazine match placebo , help evaluate long-term effectiveness ranolazine population . Periodic ECGs 24-hour Holter recording obtain evaluation QTc duration ECG Holter-derived parameter .</detailed_description>
