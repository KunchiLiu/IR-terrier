	<brief_summary>Although vast majority patient Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma ( PTMC ) excellent long-term outcome , patient experience tumor recurrence , either locally , less frequently , distant metastasis , patient die due disease . The natural course PTMC always universally accept , thus create controversy concern diagnosis treatment PTMC . Further , yet possible confidently identify PTMCs would take aggressive course leave untreated . Treatment recommendation range observation alone vigorous intervention feature total thyroidectomy , prophylactic cervical lymph node dissection , adjuvant RI ablation . Therefore , consensus yet reach biological aggressiveness PTMC therapy appropriate . Moreover , impact several clinicopathologic risk factor , include tumor size , unclear , although patient tumor ≤ 0.5cm diameter may better prognosis patient tumor 0.5-1 cm size . Most study evaluate proper extent surgery PTMC retrospective design . A prospective , long-term , randomize study large number patient , however , may feasible owe need extensive follow-up duration , cost associate study , , particularly , ethical constraint . Consequently , currently possible determine prognosis patient PTMC proper therapeutic approach patient . The investigator therefore compare long-term outcome total thyroidectomy ( TT : total near-total thyroidectomy ) less total thyroidectomy ( LT : lobectomy subtotal thyroidectomy ) large cohort patient PTMC , use propensity-score matching adjust uncontrolled assignment surgical extent patient . In addition , investigator evaluate whether tumor size , ≤ 0.5 cm &gt; 0.5 cm , significant impact determine extent surgery patient PTMC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population From March 1986 December 2006 , total 5042 patient PTC ( tumor size ) underwent initial surgical therapy institution . Of , 2441 patient ( 48.4 % ) PTMCs ≤ 1 cm diameter , 1270 undergo TT 1171 undergo LT . Complete follow-up data major clinical event available 2014 patient ( 82.5 % ) , include 1015 ( 79.9 % ) TT group 999 ( 85.3 % ) LT group ( p=0.083 ) . Patients followed-up median 11.8 year ( range , 5 26 year ) . All histopathologic diagnosis review verified endocrine pathologist use WHO criterion . The study protocol approve Institutional Review Board . Details patient ' presentation , surgical pathologic finding , adjunctive treatment obtain Yonsei University Thyroid Cancer Database . Management strategy In patient diagnosed PTMC complete radiologic histologic examination , extent thyroidectomy radioactive iodine ( RI ) therapy base prognostic factor . However , protocol institution PTMC appropriately manage change accord update clinical report validate treatment guideline . Therefore , lack standardize approach study period allow u assess impact various therapeutic modality , especially extent thyroidectomy , patient PTMC .</detailed_description>
