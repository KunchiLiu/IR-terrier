	<brief_summary>The immediate release ( IR ) formulation retigabine show superior placebo adjunctive therapy 3 adequate well-controlled study subject drug-resistant partial-onset seizure ( POS ) previously fail respond two antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) still seizures despite current treatment 1 , 2 , 3 AEDs . However , 1244 subject randomly assign treatment 3 clinical study , 10 Asian subject 5 Asian subject randomly assign treatment retigabine . Therefore , Phase III study conduct evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability , health outcome retigabine , dose 900 mg/day 600 mg/day , compare placebo adult Asian subject drug-resistant POS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Efficacy Safety 2 Doses Retigabine Immediate Release ( 900 mg/Day 600 mg/Day ) Used Adjunctive Therapy Adult Asian Subjects With Drug-resistant Partial-onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability , health outcome 2 dos retigabine immediate release ( IR ) ( GW582892 ) compare placebo adult Asian subject drug-resistant partial-onset seizure ( POS ) already take 1 , 2 , 3 antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) . This randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study compare retigabine IR dose 900 mg/day 600 mg/day take equally divided dos three time day placebo . The study design include 8-week Screening/Baseline Phase , 16-week Treatment Phase ( 4-week Titration Phase 12-week Maintenance Phase ) , 4-week Transition Taper/Follow-up Phase . Approximately 500 subject screen enrol approximately 354 subject randomly assign 1 3 treatment group ratio 1:1:1 ( retigabine 900 mg/day , retigabine 600 mg/day , placebo ) . The total duration study subject approximately 28 week . At end Maintenance Phase , eligible subject give opportunity enrol open-label extension study . The primary efficacy endpoint proportion responder , define subject &gt; /=50 % reduction 28 day total POS frequency , Baseline Phase Maintenance Phase , subject randomly assign retigabine 900 mg/day compare placebo . The key secondary efficacy endpoint proportion responder , define subject &gt; /=50 % reduction 28 day total POS frequency , Baseline Phase Maintenance Phase , subject randomly assign retigabine 600 mg/day compare placebo . The safety tolerability endpoint incidence severity adverse event ( AEs ) ; proportion subject AEs lead discontinuation ; change Baseline vital sign measurement weight ; change Baseline electrocardiogram parameter ; change Baseline haematology , chemistry , urinalysis parameter ; change Baseline American Urological Association Symptom Index post-void residual bladder ultrasound volume ; summary Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale .</detailed_description>
