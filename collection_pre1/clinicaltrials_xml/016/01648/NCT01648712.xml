	<detailed_description>Platelet dysfunction commonly observe procedure perform cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . This associated major risk thrombosis bleed postoperative period . Coating surface show diminish effect . Since coagulation system platelet involve blood activation process , coat might valuable approach inhibit different reaction . Improving biocompatibility system reduction contact activation blood element significant importance , especially neonates infant susceptible deleterious effect extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) . Biocompatible surface extracorporeal circulation technology mimic critical characteristic vascular endothelium provide thromboresistance enhance blood compatibility . These biocompatible surface mitigate foreign body response occur blood come contact non- endothelial surface . Recently , new physiologic non heparin coat different functional aspect develop alternative heparin base biological coating . This bio-passive Hydrophilic Polymer Coating Without Heparin ( BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface ) pediatric oxygenation system ( Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System ) , design mimic natural interface blood .</detailed_description>
