	<brief_summary>In protocol aim use rTMS well characterize STS role normal abnormal social cognition . With purpose , measure effect inhibitory excitatory rTMS fixation time social scene ( use eye-tracking methodology ) ability recognize human voice/sounds .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism characterize severe impairment verbal non verbal communication social interaction . Results cerebral image study suggest abnormality locate superior temporal Sulcus ( STS ) level would implicate social impairment autism . This abnormalities anatomical functional : 1 ) rest hypoperfusion detect positron emission tomography ( PET ) ; 2 ) abnormal activation social task ( fMRI ) 3 ) structural abnormality show anatomical MRI . The STS implicate social cognition normal subject . Our hypothesis anatomo-functional abnormality would appear early brain development could one first step cascade neuronal dysfunction autism . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) technique use cognitive neuroscience research well therapeutic approach certain neurological psychiatry disease . It consist apply magnetic impulse brain trough scalp non-invasive painless place coil surface head . This magnetic field induce electrical field modifies activity neuron inside magnetic field induce electrophysiological change target area . This process allow non-invasive interaction human brain action focal stimulation . In cognitive neuroscience research , interested modification cause rTMS cognitive performance order well precise functional role target region . The intensity frequency impulse control ( frequency &lt; 1 Hz = inhibitory effect ; frequency &gt; 3 Hz = excitatory effect ) . The functional characteristic give region 's eventual dysfunction may identify thank abnormality reactivity cortical connectivity . The goal project study inhibitory excitatory effect rTMS applied STS healthy control patient autism . This effect measure two main parameter social cognition : 1 ) visual perception social scene , measure eye-tracking methodology ; 2 ) auditory perception human voice . We study 50 healthy voluntary control 50 patient non-syndromic autism ( 18 25 year old ; IQ &gt; 60 ) , diagnose DSM-IV ADI-R. All participant undergo structural MRI rTMS session STS . In case , STS localise base structural MRI . The total duration rTMS session two hour . All data analyse adapted statistical method . This study allow well understanding role STS social cognition healthy subject well 's implication social impairment characterize autism . Finally , rTMS may become , near future , innovative therapeutic strategy autism .</detailed_description>
