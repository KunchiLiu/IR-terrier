	<brief_title>A Population-based Case-control Study Lung Cancer Appalachian Kentucky : The Role Environmental Carcinogens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appalachian Kentucky one high incidence rate lung cancer United States . The disproportionately high incidence explain tobacco alone . Preliminary analysis trace element content toenail sample reveal high level arsenic , chromium nickel Appalachian Kentucky resident elsewhere Kentucky . Trace elements know promote carcinogenesis increase oxidative stress , inflammation , DNA damage , reduce DNA repair efficiency . These finding justify investigation role trace element play development lung cancer region . Hypothesis : The unexpectedly high rate lung cancer Appalachian Kentucky associate exposure environmental carcinogen increase oxidative stress DNA damage . Specific Aims Aim 1 : Conduct case-control study lung cancer match control 5th Congressional District Kentucky compare rate moderate high arsenic lung cancer case control . Aim 2 : Create specimen repository biologic environmental sample subject residence analysis DNA repair marker , future , marker oxidative stress inflammation . Aim 3 : Fund four pilot project utilize collect data Aim 1 develop investigator focus lung cancer research study population generate preliminary data lead independent funding . Study Design : This population-based , case-control study encompass 5th Congressional District Kentucky . Relevance : This translational research repository fundamentally improve understand cause disproportionately high incidence lung cancer Appalachian Kentucky , foster collaboration among scientist dedicate study lung cancer provide permanent resource use future research .</detailed_description>
