	<brief_summary>This research study intend Phase I/II clinical trial , trial terminate phase 1 portion complete . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug combination use Phase II portion study , enroll participant continue study effect drug safe dose . `` Investigational '' mean combination vemurafenib leflunomide still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve drug combination type cancer . Genes specific part cell material send code message determine investigator body look like , eye color , instruct cell control growth development body . Researchers find large number melanoma cell mutation BRAF gene . Normally , BRAF gene help control cell grow . Mutations BRAF gene may disrupt control allow cell skin change cancer cell , case , cell keep divide grow control . Specifically , show vemurafenib block effect mutation BRAF gene , , result , may help prevent cancer growth . The FDA approve vemurafenib use patient BRAF mutation positive melanoma unable remove surgery ( unresectable ) spread ( metastatic ) . Leflunomide class medication call disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) . It FDA approve treatment rheumatoid arthritis believe decrease inflammation setting . However approve treatment melanoma . The researcher study believe agent may help prevent cancer growth well enhance property drug target BRAF gene ( vemurafenib ) base recently publish laboratory research , would like learn effect combination may disease . The main purpose study determine high dose vemurafenib leflunomide give combination without cause severe side effect , see whether combination vemurafenib leflunomide safe participant BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma learn combination vemurafenib leflunomide show sign effectively treat disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant metastatic melanoma . For reason , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Both leflunomide vemurafenib give pill take mouth . We instruct take leflunomide pill day vemurafenib pill twice day . We give study drug dose calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) . At start study take leflunomide alone first 14 day cycle 1 . For first 3 day cycle 1 , receive dose leflunomide large receive rest research study ( load dose ) . These first large dos introduce certain amount leflunomide body . The dos receive Day 3 low use maintain level leflunomide body . Starting Day 15 , begin twice-a-day Vemurafenib treatment continue take leflunomide daily . During cycle routine blood test , physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . These procedure perform every cycle throughout study . If skin lesion surgically remove , study doctor may ask undergo additional skin punch biopsy part research study . These sample take three time throughout study : begin study treatment , initial 2-week study treatment leflunomide alone , 2 week start leflunomide vemurafenib combination . We assess tumor either CT scan MRI scan every eight week research study . After complete participation study would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like call telephone every 4 week see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
