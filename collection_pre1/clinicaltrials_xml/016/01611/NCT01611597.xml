	<brief_title>Continuous Measurement Activity Clinical Evaluation Home , Non-ambulant Neuromuscular Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective continuous measurement muscle activity standardize set non ambulatory patient 's natural environment . This measure use innovative technology base accelerometer magneto-inertial sensor . The system intend measure physical activity patient extraction data record sensor three space ax . The non ambulatory patient include evaluated baseline 14 day later . The patient wear accelerometer device standard evaluation also home continuously 14 day . With protocol investigator want try find best variable characterizes movement upper limbs non-ambulant neuromuscular patient . The aim Pre-Acti propose primary outcome measure may use clinical monitoring patient .</detailed_description>
