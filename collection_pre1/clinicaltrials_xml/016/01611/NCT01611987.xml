	<brief_summary>Despite benefit exercise physical activity people Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) relatively inactive . Physical activity important person disability maintain physical function . A lack physical activity contribute heart disease , osteoporosis , obesity , diabetes . At moment , best way people MS exercise physical activity unknown . People MS report know . This barrier exercise . The global aim study contribute evidence role target exercise alter MS outcomes time . The design randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The primary research question extent MS Tailored Exercise Program ( MSTEP ) result great improvement exercise capacity relate outcome comparison program base general guideline exercise among people MS sedentary wish engage exercise part MS self-management . The primary outcome question exercise capacity measure use cycle ergometry . However exercise efficiency , functional ambulation , strength , component quality life include frequency intensity fatigue symptom , mood , global physical function , health perception , illness intrusiveness , also measure component global response outcome . The first confirmatory hypothesis MSTEP result great proportion people make clinically relevant gain ( least 10 % change ) exercise capacity general guideline 12 month intervention ; secondary hypothesis , may decline exercise capacity among individual end intervention follow-up one year later , decline great general guideline group augment difference group proportion make 10 % change study entry 24 month . In word , gain maintain MSTEP group general guideline group . An exploratory hypothesis target outcomes improve MSTEP program general guideline approach . An explanatory hypothesis gain accompany report great exercise enjoyment exercise self-efficacy ( confidence ) MSTEP program general guideline program leading consistent exercise engagement improve long-term adherence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Exercise Modifying Outcomes People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposal assessor-blind , parallel-group , stratified , randomize control trial . Potential participant identify population person enrol 3 MS clinic Montreal area 3 clinic Toronto . All person know ambulatory co-morbidity prevent exercise engagement capacity consent inform study write invite assessment determine eligibility entry trial . Those consent randomly assign either MSTEP program general exercise guideline program . The intervention period one year follow-up second year . The investigator target sample size 120 per group ( total 240 ) , would sufficient detect RR &gt; 1.5 80 % power . Sample size estimate use pc-size software . The sample size take account drop-outs inflate variance outcomes multiple imputation use deal miss data . The main analysis logistic regression test main hypothesis relate superiority MSTEP program base great proportion people make clinically relevant gain exercise capacity 1 year . A secondary outcome difference proportion 2 year also use logistic regression . The analysis base intention-to-treat person analyse group randomize . A secondary analysis estimate impact exercise relevant outcome . For approach , outcome convert binary response variable base publish clinically meaningful change generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) use test rate response MSTEP program rate response general guideline approach . Multiple outcomes improves efficiency study total number data point equivalent total n multiply number test reduce extent outcomes correlate . Highly correlate outcome make effective sample size small less strongly correlate outcomes . If statistically significant effect intervention , , effect separate outcome interpret real . The result trial use develop guideline exercise MS . The investigator process copyright name program ( MSTEP ) . Upon publication finding , description content make available cost . If proven effective , train guide professional patient produce likely take advantage end-of-grant Knowledge Translation ( KT ) Supplement . Note : The investigator fund KT supplement produce general guide people MS , entitle : Getting Your Life MS . The knowledge generate used people MS health professional promote exercise engagement .</detailed_description>
