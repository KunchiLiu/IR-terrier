	<brief_summary>Trauma patient , transfuse multiple blood product treat shock due blood loss , frequently develop inappropriately low vasopressin level . Vasopressin hormone necessary maintain adequate blood pressure low level associate need increase transfusion , vasopressor additional morbidity . Vasopressin routinely use ICU treat septic shock disease process result decrease vasopressin level low blood pressure . This study investigate potential benefit early vasopressin supplementation resuscitation trauma patient applicability use copeptin vasopressin biomarker . Trauma patient receive 6 unit blood product within 12 hour arrival randomize receive vasopressin bolus plus infusion similar volume placebo ( normal saline ) 48 hour . Serial blood sample take 5 day post-injury . Clinical demographic data record prospectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AVERT Shock : Arginine Vasopressin During Early Resuscitation Traumatic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma remain leading cause death age 40 United States , large percentage patient die blood loss within initial post-injury hour . Although resuscitation intravenous fluid blood product remain gold standard last twenty year , vigorous volume resuscitation may curative associate development serious complication include coagulopathy , acute lung injury , abdominal compartment syndrome . Massive resuscitation also profoundly alters neuroendocrine milieu need maintain vasomotor tone severely injured patient may progress state recalcitrant hypotension , multi-organ failure , ultimately death . The inclusion vasoactive hormone resuscitation could potentially prevent profound hypotension see late stage shock , limit need aggressive volume blood product resuscitation , decrease incidence resuscitation-associated complication . As , exist urgent need evaluate novel resuscitation strategy target neuroendocrine deficiency hemorrhagic shock . The hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , particular , may prove useful adjunct resuscitation . Secreted posterior pituitary , vasopressin essential maintain vasomotor tone hemorrhagic shock low level associate development catecholamine-resistant hypotension profound venodilation . Trauma patient require 5 unit blood product initial resuscitation risk develop vasopressin insufficiency , need vasopressor support , often require long ICU stay . Vasopressin enjoy widespread off-label use vasopressor cardiac arrest , septic shock , post-cardiopulmonary vasodilatory shock . The central hypothesis trauma patient present hemorrhagic shock risk vasopressin deficiency would benefit early vasopressin supplementation . This study investigate early use vasopressin resuscitation traumatic shock result few blood transfusion , decrease need crystalloid resuscitation , low incidence resuscitation relate complication .</detailed_description>
