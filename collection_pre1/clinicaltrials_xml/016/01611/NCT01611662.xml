	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Cisplatin Before Surgery Treating Patients With Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess rate complete response ( pT0 ) cystectomy follow preoperative dose dense gemcitabine cisplatin ( DD GC ) patient muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity profile DD GC give neoadjuvant setting : To define number patient complete three cycle treatment without dose reduction , describe incidence toxicity . II . To assess 5 year overall relapse free survival patient receive neoadjuvant DD GC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tissue specimens patient assess molecular marker correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 cisplatin IV day 1 divide day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-8 week chemotherapy , patient undergo radical cystectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
