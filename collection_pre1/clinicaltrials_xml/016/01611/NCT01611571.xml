	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop new treatment option osteoporosis men . The Investigators study two medication three treatment regimen . First , risedronate ( FDA approve ) study monotherapy . Second , investigator study injectable parathyroid hormone ( PTH 134 , teriparatide余 FDA approve ) , therapy male osteoporosis . PTH , naturally occur hormone produce parathyroid gland , one important regulator bone metabolism . The drug study protocol , teriparatide , first aminoterminal 34 amino acid native 84amino acid peptide . Teriparatide contain classical biological activity native PTH . In study postmenopausal woman , small study 23 men osteoporosis large study 437 men treatment teriparatide lead significant increase bone density . Although teriparatide actonel approve osteoporosis men additional study medication need order establish best use drug . This study focus entirely new treatment approach , namely combination two medication treatment osteoporosis risedronate teriparatide evaluate whether combination therapy superior therapy either medication alone . This study also design assess extent risedronate maintain increase bone density course mono combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Risedronate - Parathyroid Hormone Trial Male Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study involve 24month commitment , constitute 12 visit outline . The study coordinator contact patient remotely phone email Month 9 visit , Month 15 , Month 21 visit require travel Columbia University Medical Center . This randomized , doubleblind study two phase . The first 18month phase 3 arm . Patients randomize receive either : Risedronate / arm 1余 33 % total number patient Teriparatide / arm 2余 33 % total population , The combination Teriparatide Risedronate / arm 3余 33 % total population . All patient receive daily subcutaneous injection small , 31 gauge needle ( Teriparatide 20 ug placebo vehicle ) , well weekly pill ( Risedronate 35 mg placebo ) . The second phase study last 6 month . During time , patient stop daily injection continue take weekly pill . These pill contain Risedronate patient . Thus , second phase study , last 6 month , one arm ; , participant open label Risedronate six month . TOTAL : 90 men Primary Endpoint : change spine bone density phase one study . The PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE study percentage change lumbar spine bone density 18 month therapy compare three group . Power analysis conduct base upon ascertain significance change first 18 month subsequent 6 month protocol . Based upon 2-tailed test alpha 0.05 , anticipate change three arm readily apparent lumbar spine `` n '' 30 group . Secondary Endpoint : change LS bone density 24 month , change hip radius bone density phase one phase two study , change bone marker , morphometric vertebral fracture 18 month . VISIT ONE : Screening visit : At visit study staff review Consent Form ( patient person obtain consent sign consent form ) inclusion/exclusion criterion . They collect demographic information , medical history , treatment history patient 's osteoporosis , prior medication history . Physical exam mouth , thyroid/neck , heart , lung , abdomen , extremity , skin , mental status , sensory/motor status , lymph node , musculoskeletal , general appearance , height , weight , blood pressure perform order identify condition may exclude potential participant study . This hereto forth refer `` Physical Exam '' Blood collect patient . A total 2 tablespoon blood volume drawn patient test serum calcium , creatinine , parathyroid hormone , hepatic function , ( Total Protein , Albumin , Globulin , A/G Ratio , Total Bilirubin , Direct Bilirubin , Alkaline Phosphatase , ALT , AST ) , testosterone level determine patient 's eligibility study . Approximately 1.5 tablespoon blood store research . The blood test later bone marker . Duration : approximately 3 hour VISIT TWO : Baseline/0 visit : On day patient begin medication . Patients learn administer injection ( Teriparatide ) take study pill ( Risedronate ) receive first 6months worth study supply . The study drug manage Columbia University Research Pharmacy . The number injection pen number pill give patient record case report form . This hereto forth refer `` Study Drug Supply/ ReSupply '' . In addition study drug , patient require take multivitamin least 400 IU vitamin D least 500 mg calcium day . This consider standard care people osteoporosis . The patient ask he/she experience leg cramp , fatigue , depression , constipation , increased urination , back pain/kidney stone , local irritation/inflammation injection site difficulty swallowing/esophageal ulcer , dental problem need tooth pull , implant place dental procedure , nonhealing mouth sore . The patient respond symptom absent , mild , moderate , severe . This information collect baseline comparison symptom may develop consequence study medication usage . This hereto forth refer `` Adverse Events '' . Patients ask change supplementary prescription medication since last visit . Patients ask change treatment condition old new since last visit . Patients ask medical condition event occur significantly change since last visit . All information record case report form . This hereto forth refer `` New Conditions/Con Meds '' . Blood collect patient . A total 2 tablespoon blood volume drawn patient . Approximately 0.5 tablespoon blood use test blood calcium creatinine monitor safety patient . This hereto forth refer `` Blood Calcium/Creatinine '' . Approximately 1.5 tablespoon blood store research . The blood test later bone marker . This hereto forth refer `` Blood Storage . '' Urine collect patient . Urine collect 24hour period store research test later Calcium Creatinine level . This hereto forth refer `` 24 Hour Urine '' Additionally , spot urine sample collect patient visit . This store research test later urine NTX . This hereto forth refer `` Urine Storage '' Xrays lumbar thoracic spine ( Lumbar Thoracic AP Lateral image ) do establish baseline fracture presence . This hereto forth refer `` XRay '' . Dual Xray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) perform establish baseline bone density . This hereto forth refer `` BMD '' Duration : approximately 3 hour VISIT THREE : Week 1 : Procedures repeat include Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Blood Storage , Urine Storage , 24 Hour Urine , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : approximately 30 minute VISIT FOUR : Month 1 : Procedures repeat include Blood Storage , Urine Storage , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : approximately 30 minute VISIT FIVE : Month 3 : Procedures repeat include Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Urine Storage , Adverse Events , New Conditions/ Con Meds Duration : approximately 30 minute VISIT SIX : Month 6 : Procedures repeat include Physical Exam , Study Drug Supply/ ReSupply , Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Blood Storage , Urine Storage , BMD , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : approximately 1.5 hour . VISIT SEVEN : Month 9 : phone visit : Procedures repeat include Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds . Duration : Approximately 15 minute . VISIT EIGHT : Month 12 : Procedures repeat include Study Drug Supply/ ReSupply , Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Blood Storage , Urine Storage , BMD , XRay , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : approximately 2.5 hour . VISIST NINE : Month 15 : phone visit : Procedures repeat include Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : Approximately 15 minute . VISIT TEN : Month 18 : Termination phase 1 entry phase 2 . Procedures repeat include Physical Exam , Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Blood Storage , Urine Storage , 24 Hour Urine , BMD , XRay , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds . Study Drug Supply/ ReSupply also occur . Of note , Risedronate , injectable medication ) . Patients therefore give supply 6months worth study pill . Duration : approximately 2.5 hour VISIT ELEVEN : Month 21 : phone visit : Procedures repeat include Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds Duration : Approximately 15 minute . VISIT TWELVE : Month 24 : FINAL STUDY VISIT . Study physicians discuss bone density result recommend course poststudy treatment ( need ) . Procedures repeat include Physical Exam , Blood Calcium/Creatinine , Blood Storage , Urine Storage , 24 Hour Urine , BMD , XRay , Adverse Events , New Conditions/Con Meds . Termination study occur . Duration : approximately 3.5 hour .</detailed_description>
