	<brief_title>Methylselenocysteine Effects Circadian Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All living cell circadian ( daily ) rhythm control variety bodily function change throughout day , include body temperature , sleep , hunger , activity , hormone level , etc . The circadian rhythm body control amount light enters eye , planet length rhythm 24 hour long . It therefore reasonable suspect upset timing rhythm would lead change body function ( commonly experience `` jet lag '' ) prolong change might even lead alteration bodily function contribute disease . This suggest people whose service community require often work night ( nurse , doctor , police , hospital staff , firefighter , airline crew , factory worker , etc ) , might elevate risk develop disease . Studies show woman shift work elevate risk breast cancer , probably result alter hormone level cycling . Other study show vitamin supplementation naturally occur dietary amino acid call organic selenium ( i.e. , methylselenocysteine ) restore disrupt rhythm possibly decrease disease risk . Thus , purpose study investigate whether take daily selenium ( i.e. , methylselenocysteine ) restore disrupted circadian rhythm shift worker .</detailed_description>
