	<brief_summary>Hospital-acquired infection common complication preterm infant . The diagnosis fast accurate . Indeed , early identification suspect infection important , since early administration antibiotic lower risk septic shock improves long term outcome infect newborns survive . Besides , high specificity diagnosis infection allow reduction inappropriate treatment thus prevent emergence antibiotic resistance . The aim study develop computer-assisted diagnosis tool , base real time analysis cardio-respiratory signal , aid neonatologist diagnosis infection preterm infant , bedside .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospital-acquired infection increase morbidity mortality preterm infant . Early diagnosis infection difficult mainly due poor performance clinical sign need invasive procedure get blood test . However , early administration antibiotic lower risk septic shock improves long term outcome infect newborns survive . Many clinical feature describe , associate ongoing infection inconsistent , variable nonspecific . Similarly , many invasive laboratory test propose diagnosis infection newborn need blood sample none good predictive value . The combined analysis heart rate respiratory characteristic appear promising tool diagnosis infection preterm infant . These signal non-invasively record computerized real time analysis would allow continuous assessment risk infection . The main objective test hypothesis analyse variability cardiac cycle duration , variability respiratory cycle amplitude duration , relationship , significantly improve performance diagnosis late onset infection preterm infant bedside neonatal unit .</detailed_description>
