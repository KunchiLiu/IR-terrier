	<detailed_description>Investigators institution ( Hwang &amp; Richardson ) * document racial disparity use CT scan diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage , ( SAH ) life-threatening form stroke . Subsequent analysis find similar finding NHAMCS , national ED Visit database* . The investigator compare effectiveness 1 ) audit-feedback intervention provide data race-specific CT rate 2 ) clinical decision support ( CDS ) message electronic `` headache '' chart template eliminate previously observe Black-White disparity CT rate rule SAH . Study Setting : The adult section Mount Sinai Emergency Department , urban academic department annual volume 70,000 adult visit patient population represent diverse cross-section race socioeconomic group . The adult patient cared staff include : attending physician , physician assistant , emergency medicine resident physician , rotate resident physician specialty .

Over 24-month period investigator compare intervention control group ' rate test SAH across race , control patient acuity , age co-morbidities . Because close working relationship among attend resident physician department may lead knowledge diffusion , intervention may change behavior control group well intervention group , thus lead underestimation intervention effect measure between- group difference . The investigator use time series design allow u evaluate effect . 10 month implementation first intervention , clinical decision support message implement . The impact intervention evaluate use repeated measure design use mixed linear model .</detailed_description>
