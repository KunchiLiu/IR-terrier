	<brief_summary>This research study subject receive bone marrow transplant . As part transplant subject receive stem cell donor agree donate stem cell . Unfortunately , take long time immune system recover bone marrow transplant . This make likely patient develop serious infection . This study do well understand immune system recover transplant . The immune system include cell help fight infection . This study help investigator understand patient risk develop infection transplant . All child adult receive standard vaccine ( shot ) lifetime provide protection many different infection . One infection tetanus , bacteria cause life-threatening problem . After transplant patient long protection infection tetanus . Therefore , patient need receive vaccine ( shot ) transplant . This usually do 1-2 year transplant , since may take long patient normal immune system . However , investigator believe time take patient develop normal protection tetanus shorten patient patient 's stem cell donor receive tetanus vaccine . The goal study determine give tetanus vaccine donor patient provide patient enough protection ( immunity ) prevent infection follow bone marrow transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To participate study , patient need give informed consent bone marrow transplant . Before receive tetanus vaccine , would like test patient 's immune system tetanus . We want test patient 's immune system tetanus day patient receive bone marrow transplant . Approximately 3 month transplant , patient still eligible , receive additional tetanus booster shot . We draw blood test immune system tetanus time point list . TREATMENT PLAN : If subject meet eligibility requirement consent part study , collect 8 mL ( 1.7 teaspoon ) blood subject test immunity 7 10 day bone marrow transplant . The subject receive tetanus vaccine ( give injection upper arm thigh muscle ) day . We collect approximately amount blood ( 2 teaspoon ) day patient would receive bone marrow transplant . We also collect amount blood 1 week , 2 week , 4 week 3 month , 6 month 12 month transplant . This help u see patient immune system respond vaccine . Three month transplant , patient receive additional tetanus vaccine ( know booster shot ) , patient still eligible receive . Patient 's eligible receive booster shot remain well problem severe infection , graft versus host disease relapse . We collect 8 ml ( 1.7 teaspoon ) blood 1 week , 2 week 4 week receive booster shot determine respond vaccine .</detailed_description>
