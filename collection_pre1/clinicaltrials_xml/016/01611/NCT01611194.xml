	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria On active duty ( TRICARE beneficiary ) time consent 6month visit Veteran , well Active Duty military become Veterans enrollment . Men woman 1865 year age time study enrollment . Able equalize middle ear pressure test chamber pressure tolerate chamber environment . Able speak read English , primary language . Agrees appear able participate outcome assessment . Agrees provide blood sample clinical lab test . Demonstrates ability offer informed consent sign study inform consent document . Participants station live outside Colorado Springs/Denver , Colorado area must willing able travel . A reliable companion may accompany participant travel supervision require . Active duty participant must obtain letter support supervisor command officer prior outcome assessment ( travel , necessary ) OAC . Participants must history least one ( minimum requirement ) mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) persistent symptom meet follow criterion : Brain injury occur 3 month prior baseline screen local site , recent injury occur 5 year prior randomization . Most recent traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) occur active duty . TBI cause nonpenetrating trauma blast exposure . TBI result least one follow time injury : period loss decrease level consciousness ( 30 minute ) ; loss memory event immediately injury ( 24 hour ) ; alteration mental state time injury ( become daze confused ) . Has current complaint TBI symptom headache , dizziness , cognitive affective problem score least 3 postconcussive symptom assess OSU TBIID . Has receive current standard care pharmacologic nonpharmacologic intervention TBI concomitant post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) significant change psychoactive therapy least 1 month . Creatinine level less equal EACH laboratory 's upper limit normal . If creatinine level exceeds EACH laboratory 's upper limit normal , participant CT scan due risk contrast dyeinduced renal failure . Such participant may randomize must approve Study Director . Prisoners . Pregnant Women . Minors . Individuals whose recent TBI sustain illegal activity . Potential active duty participant station &gt; 1 hour outside designate recruitment area participate local site exclude unless command authorize temporary relocation appropriate relocation resource . Potential Veteran participant live &gt; 1 hour outside designate recruitment area participate local site , must willing able travel local site participate require local site visit without additional financial assistance describe Veteran Payment Schedule ( consent attachment C ) . Active duty individual anticipate prolonged TAD/TDY deployment within 6 month study enrollment exclude . Veterans anticipate prolonged travel relocation within 6 month study enrollment exclude . An individual following characteristic exclude study base contraindication hyperbaric pressurization hyperbaric oxygenation study assessment measure : Women pregnant plan become pregnant study period . Women breastfeed . Women childbearing potential agree practice acceptable form birth control study period . Epilepsy seizure disorder stable anticonvulsant therapy ( stable define 6 month seizurefree ) . Inability protect airway require frequent suction . Known suspected perilymphatic fistula . Presence tracheostomy ( due limitation autoinflation middle ear space ) . Diabetes ( risk hypoglycemia ) . Creatinine level exceed 1.5 time EACH laboratory 's upper limit normal . A diagnosis ( patient report medical record evidence within one year ) untreated clinical hypo hyperthyroidism . Allergy iodinebased contrast dye ( exclusion criterion neuroimaging assessment measure ) . Presence implanted device ( e.g. , cardiac defibrillator , intrathecal drug delivery device , cochlear implant , pacemaker , stent aneurysm clip ) pose increase risk participant hyperbaric exposure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Any implanted device must clear manufacturer exposure hyperbaric pressure 3.0 Tesla MRI . Participants must travel altitude great 10,000 foot chamber session intervention . Paratroopers unable suspend activity chamber exposure . An individual refractive eye surgery within last 90 day . Any brain injury traumatic etiology , stroke druginduced coma . Heart failure ejection fraction &lt; 50 % ( due increase risk precipitate acute lung edema exposure HBO2 ) . Emphysema , chronic bronchitis , bullous lung disease ( due risk pulmonary barotrauma hyperbaric decompression ) . Asthma well control . An individual following characteristic exclude study base confound outcome measure : Those unable participate fully outcome assessment unless randomization review approve ( write ) study director . Vision uncorrectable 20/50 ( monocular vision acceptable ) . Dynavision within 30 day screen . Deafness ear define 90 dB HL great , speech frequency 500 Hz , 1 kHz , 2 kHz 4 kHz ear ; determine baseline measurement pure tone air conduction threshold . Participant selfreport document diagnosis psychiatric disorder medical record within last year follow : schizophrenia , dissociative disorder , bipolar disease . Anxiety claustrophobia preclude participation hyperbaric chamber session neuroimaging procedure . Verifiable neurodegenerative disease ( e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , senile dementia ) . Presence chronic debilitate disease ( e.g. , endstage renal disease , endstage liver disease , diabetes sequela ) . Documented unresolved anemia , anemia define hematocrit le 30 % . History , selfreport , receive therapeutic ionizing radiation head . Foreign material head would interfere brain imaging ( e.g. , MRI compute tomography [ CT ] ) , unless randomization clear study director . Foreign ( unknown composition ) metallic/ferromagnetic material within individual pose risk MRI , unless randomization clear study director . History , self report , illicit drug use , except remote ( prior military enlistment ) nonhabitual ( habitual consider great weekend ) use marijuana . History , self report medical record last year , alcohol abuse . Prospective participant sober last 90 day prior screen may eligible base site principal investigator determination . Current positive urine test illicit substance ( ) . Any condition use prescribed medication , opinion investigator , participation study would impact safety individual . Brain injury moderate severe degree : duration loss consciousness time injury great 30 minute , duration posttraumatic amnesia great 24 hour , brain injury penetrate etiology . Any lifetime history penetrate brain injury . Active malignancy , prior malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma ) within last 5 year , prior treatment bleomycin ( trade name Blenoxane ) . Prior treatment doxorubicin ( trade name Adriamycin ) acceptable long echocardiography follow treatment normal . Unable abstain caffeine tobacco product least 2hour interval . Concurrent enrollment alternate interventional trial . Unable unwilling cease participation sport another head injury likely ( e.g. , mixed martial art , box ) study period . Diagnosis Meniere 's disease selfreport medical record evidence within one year . PreTBI history significant dizziness ( lasting 1 day ) . A prospective participant follow characteristic exclude study protect blinding : Prior treatment HBO2 TBI PCS . Prior HBO2 treatment indication TBI PCS within last 3 month . Experienced hyperbaric chamber inside attendant ( anyone deem experience hyperbaric pressurization could compromise blind allocation ) . Technical , military , occupational diver .</criteria>
