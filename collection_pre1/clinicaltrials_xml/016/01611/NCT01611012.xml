	<brief_title>The Development Clinical Test Assess Inflammatory Phenotype Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma heterogeneous disease classify level control , disease severity inflammatory phenotype . However , different domain overlap classification patient accord characteristic caused confusion literature . Concerning inflammatory phenotype international consensus present regard diagnostic power induce sputum . This methodology , however , difficult implement general practice . Local inflammation associate complex combination systemic pro- anti-inflammatory signal induce change responsive leukocyte . These change use read-out type degree inflammatory disease . Hypothesis : This facilitate diagnosis inflammatory phenotype asthma , general application induce sputum feasible . Goals 1 . To investigate whether analysis antibody direct active Beta-1 Beta-2-integrins ( CD29/CD18 ) FcγRII ( CD32 ) prim eosinophils allows diagnosis eosinophilic asthma compare analysis sputum eosinophilia . 2 . To evaluate applicability antibody active β1/β2-integrins FcγRII symptomatic asthma patient test diagnose eosinophilic neutrophilic asthma . 3 . To determine specific protein profile serum asthma patient proteomics development diagnostic test . 4 . To evaluate effectiveness new test comparison FeNO .</detailed_description>
