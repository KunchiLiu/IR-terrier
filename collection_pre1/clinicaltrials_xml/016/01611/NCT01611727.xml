	<brief_summary>Among woman BRCA1 mutation breast cancer , choice chemotherapy critical issue . There emerge data suggest mutation carrier may respond differently non-carriers particular agent . BRCA1-associated cancer differ non-hereditary cancer range pathologic molecular factor , include tumor grade histologic appearance . Several study show response treatment woman BRCA1-associated breast cancer reflect underlying tumor biology , particular , impairment DNA damage response repair pathway , possible exploit sensitivity BRCA1-associated cancer DNA damage . It equally important investigator evaluate benefit cisplatin woman disseminate breast cancer , include previously treat one chemotherapy regimens . This study undertaken evaluate efficacy cisplatin chemotherapy BRCA1 carrier metastatic breast cancer . The primary objective determine objective response rate cisplatin BRCA1 carrier metastatic breast cancer . The secondary objective determine 3-year survival evaluate toxicity cisplatin BRCA1 carrier metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
