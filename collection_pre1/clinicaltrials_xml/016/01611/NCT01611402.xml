	<brief_summary>Background : - Tuberculosis ( TB ) infection particularly deadly happen people also infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . However , much know two infection affect . Some people HIV TB infection develop health problem start take either HIV TB medication . These drug improve body ability fight infection , sometimes sudden improvement make infect person initially become sicker . Researchers want study infection affect immune system gene expression people TB may may HIV , see pattern gene expression may predict whether people start treatment may get sicker initially . Objectives : - To study gene expression immune system people TB may may also HIV . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year age tuberculosis . - Participants draw study site United States China . Design : - Participants divide three study group . The first group TB HIV . The second group TB HIV treat . The third group TB HIV currently treat . - All participant single study visit . Blood sample collect visit . A medical history also collect . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain one deadliest infection throughout world , particularly set HIV infection . In China , TB frequently diagnose complication HIV infection . The immunopathogenesis TB remain unclear , although know HIV infection increase risk develop active TB , either infection reactivation latent disease , yet determine . It also know patient co-infected HIV TB na ( SqrRoot ) antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) particularly high risk develop Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome ( IRIS ) ART therapy initiate , immunopathogenesis reaction also unclear . The use genomics significantly improve understanding disease pathogenesis increasingly use predict response therapy well . Recently , blood transcriptional signature capable distinguish active latent TB infection identify use highly parallelize analytical platform capable simultaneous survey transcription know gene . These signature hint complex role type I interferons development active TB infection , yet study people HIV TB co-infection . Further depth study need characterize spectrum response TB/HIV co-infection , response correlate clinical data . We propose cross-sectional cohort study , conduct US China , identify blood mRNA expression profile distinguish TB mono-infected TB/HIV co-infected ART-na ( SqrRoot ) patient treat patient without TB-IRIS . Secondary objective include correlate gene expression level clinical outcome soluble biomarkers . The study comprise test set ( China ) 140 patient divide among different cohort validation set ( US ) 125 patient divide among three group Participation involve single study visit consist small volume phlebotomy ( approximately 25 mL safety lab , transcriptome analysis , lymphocyte count , serum plasma storage ) urine sample information glean clinical record enter coded Case Report Form ( CRF ) . The U.S. cohort additional 40 mLs blood collect mononuclear cell ( total approximately 65mLs ) .The study exclude woman pregnant breast-feeding ( associate immune compromise change marker associated inflammation ) , person anemia ( may unable tolerate phlebotomy solely research purpose ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For patient : Adults , age 18 old TB diagnosis , ascertain follow : 1. specimen biopsy smear , culture , PCR positivity 2. compatible clinical presentation image strong suspicion TB necessitate initiation empiric TB therapy ( case confirmation culture laboratory mean may follow enrollment , alternatively clinical improvement response TB therapy may confirm diagnosis ) . If TB diagnosis confirm ( i.e . culture positive NTM ) , patient exclude final analysis . Ability willingness subject legal guardian/representative understand study requirement give informed consent . In event adult subject unable , due illness mental incapacity , give informed consent , person authorize durable power attorney ( DPA ) legal guardian may give consent subject blood obtain , ship , test protocol . Agree storage study data biologic specimen use future study immune function , tuberculosis , genetics , and/or HIV pathogenesis . Patients TB monoinfected arm ( Group A ) would additionally eligible : HIV negative ( documented seronegative within 1 month study visit ) Not receive TB therapy 7 day prior study visit ( Group A1 ) Currently TB therapy &gt; 7 day &lt; 5 month ( Group A2 ) Patients TB/HIV coinfected arm ( Group B ) would additionally eligible : HIV positive ( outside HIV test accept ) Not receive TB therapy 7 day prior study visit Untreated ART na ( SqrRoot ) ( accepted ART past none within last 6 month ) . Patients TB/HIV coinfected , treat arm ( Group C ) would additionally eligible : HIV positive Currently receive TB therapy Currently receive ART ( The subset patient without TBIRIS antiretroviral therapy least 8 12 week . The subset patient TBIRIS enrol time TBIRIS event ) evidence adherence ( often measure clinical improvement , medication refill laboratory value ) The TBIRIS subset patient ( 15 patient NIAID 20 patient SHAPHC ) would also need meet criterion paradoxical TBIRIS EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy postpartum period ( 6 month postpartum breastfeeding , whichever long ) . Documented history hemoglobin recent blood draw less 7g/dL .</criteria>
