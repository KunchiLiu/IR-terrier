	<brief_summary>Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere ( DT-LM ) novel proprietary delivery system docetaxel develop Shenyang Pharmaceutical University . In Phase I study , DT-LM evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) patient advance solid tumor . It also evaluate pharmacokinetic anti-tumor effect DT-LM compare commerical docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere ( DT-LM ) Injection Chemotherapy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel ( currently market Taxotere® ) , give intravenous intraperitoneal injection , contribute significantly treatment variety malignancy , ovarian , breast , gastric , non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , well head neck cancer cancer . In preclinical , DT-LM show reduce toxicity ( especially myelosuppression）and comparable therapeutic efficacy . In clinic , believe DT-LM offer few side effect patient similar dos , possibly great effectiveness use high dos . DT-LM could avoid serious hypersensitivity reaction cause Tween 80 , also stable , safe convenient clinical administration . This study design determine follow : - The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) DT-LM . - The pharmacokinetics docetaxel follow intravenous administration DT-LM . - Any anti-tumor effect DT-LM . Controlled trial also carry reveal difference safety , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics DT-LM Taxotere .</detailed_description>
