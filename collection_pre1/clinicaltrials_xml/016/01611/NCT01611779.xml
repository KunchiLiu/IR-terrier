	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) become major health problem United States . With prevalence middle-aged adult 2-4 % population , untreated OSA implicate increase risk cardiovascular disease , include hypertension heart failure . The first common treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment , utilized estimate 3 million Americans . CPAP effective reduce apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) use properly . However , nasal mask require CPAP sleep lead poor acceptance compliance rate . Published study CPAP show 58-8- % patient accept CPAP therapy 65-90 % patient exhibit long-term compliance CPAP . It widely accept region behind tongue major site collapse obstructive sleep apnea . In fact many surgical procedure perform currently address tongue base collapse . These include RF ablation tongue base , genioglossus advancement , hyoid suspension , maxillomandibular advancement , tongue base suspension . The current study design evaluate feasibility tongue stabilization , assess safety treatment tongue stabilization .</detailed_description>
