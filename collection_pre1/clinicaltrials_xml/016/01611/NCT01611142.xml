	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine overall response rate KW-0761 treatment patient relapse refractory PTCL . KW-0761 target CCR4 . CCR4 receptor macrophage derive chemokines MDC/CCL22 TARC/CCL17 . Chemokines consider play role recruitment immune inflammatory cell anti-tumor response selective homing neoplastic B T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study KW-0761 ( Mogamulizumab ) Subjects With Previously Treated Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma ( PTCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PTCL rare heterogeneous disease remain difficult diagnose treat . In majority PTCL subtypes , patient older age ( &gt; 60 year ) present advanced stage disease.With exception ALCL-ALK-positive subtype respond well CHOP combine chemotherapy , PTCL subtypes become refractory even aggressive chemotherapy regimens relapse . Overall survival PTCL patient poor compare aggressive B-cell lymphomas.Thus , novel effective therapy needed.KW-0761 ( mogamulizumab ) defucosylated , humanize , IgG1 mAb enhance antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) bind CCR4 , molecule suggest significantly involved patient PTCL .</detailed_description>
