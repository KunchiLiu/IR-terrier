	<brief_title>A Study Ibrutinib Combination With Bendamustine Rituximab Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign chance study treatment ) , double-blind ( patient study personnel know identity study treatment ) , placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study determine benefit risk combine ibrutinib bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) patient relapse refractory CLL/SLL follow least 1 line prior systemic therapy . Approximately 580 patient randomize 1:1 ratio either treatment arm A ( placebo ) treatment arm B ( ibrutinib 420 mg ) . Study medication administer orally daily continuous schedule . All patient receive BR background therapy plus either ibrutinib placebo maximum 6 cycle , treatment ibrutinib placebo continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . A treatment cycle define 28 day . The study include screen phase , treatment phase , follow-up phase . Study end define either 80 % patient die 5 year last patient randomize study , whichever occur first . Patients treatment arm A ( placebo ) complete treatment phase , disease progression ( interim analysis ) meet International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( IWCLL ) criterion treatment , may crossover ibrutinib treatment ( treatment arm B ) , investigator discretion . This open-label , next-line treatment ibrutinib continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal study , study end , whichever occur early . One interim analysis plan study . Efficacy evaluation include compute tomography scan , laboratory testing , focus physical examination , bone marrow biopsy aspirate , assessment patient-reported outcome . In treatment arm , sample development population-based pharmacokinetic ( PK ; study body drug ) approach collect . Safety assess throughout study .</detailed_description>
