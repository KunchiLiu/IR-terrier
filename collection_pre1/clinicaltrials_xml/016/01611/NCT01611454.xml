	<brief_title>New Fabric Attenuation Device Endovascular Interventional Radiology II ( PREFER II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PREFER II trial three main objective . The primary objective trial show much radiation attenuation provide XPF thyroid collar absolute relative term . The secondary objective study measure compare amount radiation interventional radiologist expose per case interventional suite set use FDA approve XPF thyroid collar standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collar . The third objective ass operator comfort wear XPF protection device . In order achieve objective , measurement perform 150 consecutive interventional procedure require C-arm fluoroscopy perform BCVI . A prospective randomization perform , assign participant wear standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collar wear FDA approve XPF thyroid collar . Radiation exposure monitor 2 radiation detector ( TLDs , one inside one outside thyroid collar ) participant require wear . After procedure participant ask rate comfort wear device scale 1 100 .</detailed_description>
