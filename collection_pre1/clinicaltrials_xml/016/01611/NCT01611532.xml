	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis multi-system disease unpredictable clinical course significant morbidity mortality ( Wilmer , 2004 ) . Approximately 20 % patient develop multi-organ failure require management within critical care environment ( Dambrauskas et al. , 2009 ) . However much pathophysiology disease , particularly understanding patient develop life-threatening disease whilst others relatively benign course , remain unclear . Many predictive scale result attempt predict patient likely develop severe disease ( Imrie , Ranson , APACHE-II etc . ) ( Barreto &amp; Rodriguez , 2007 ) . However none score system actually correlate clinical finding pathophysiology disease process , make comprehension rationale prognostic value scale show difficult . This lead latterly interest measurement intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) potential novel method predict outcome acute pancreatitis ( Buter et al. , 2002 ) since intra-abdominal hypertension explain disease process acute pancreatitis . It well recognise intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) cause organ dysfunction critically ill patient associate high morbidity mortality rate ( Sugrue et al. , 1999 ) . Abdominal compartment syndrome ( defined increase IAP &gt; 20mmHg ) associate new organ failure ( Malbrain et al. , 2006 ) . The mechanism believe contribute IAH acute pancreatitis include increase capillary permeability , hypoalbuminaemia volume overload ( `` third space loss '' ) , produce retroperitoneal visceral oedema ( Dambrauskas et al. , 2009 ) .
