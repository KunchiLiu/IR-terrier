	<detailed_description>Rigid lock plating construct suppress fracture healing , particularly near cortex adjacent plate interfragmentary motion minimal . Dynamic fixation Far Cortical Locking ( FCL ) screw reduces construct stiffness induces axial interfragmentary motion stimulate symmetric callus formation heal . Two version FCL screw commercially available , clinical durability novel concept document date . This prospective observational study document early clinical experience MotionLoc® FCL screw stabilization distal femur fracture assess durability potential complication . Thirty-two consecutive patient 33 distal femur fracture ( AO/OTA type 33-A 33-C ) prospectively enrol three trauma center . Fractures stabilize plate osteosynthesis MotionLoc® FCL screw without supplemental bone graft bone morphogenic protein . Thirty patient 31 fracture available follow-up union revision . Follow-up visit 6 , 12 , 24 week comprise functional radiographic assessment implant fixation fracture healing , include compute tomography scan week 12 . The primary endpoint fracture heal absence complication revision . There incidence implant breakage diaphyseal fixation failure . Thirty 31 fracture heal within 15.6 ± 6.2 week , evident bridge callus pain-free load bearing . There two revision , one 5 day post surgery correct mal-rotation , one 6 month post surgery revise non-union . Periosteal callus distribution week 6 symmetrical , similar amount callus medial cortex ( 35 % ) anterior cortex ( 30 % ) posterior cortex ( 35 % ) . In 23 fracture ( 74 % ) , callus formation extend lateral cortex plate . Absence hardware fixation failure suggest dynamic plat distal femur fracture FCL screw provide safe effective fixation . Moreover , amount symmetric distribution periosteal callus suggest dynamic fixation FCL screw may promote increased fracture heal standard lock plating . However , hypothesis stimulatory effect dynamic fixation fracture heal require investigation future randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
