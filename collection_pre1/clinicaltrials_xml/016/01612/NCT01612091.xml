	<brief_title>The Monitoring Messenger : Mobile Patient Monitoring Pediatric Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There limited number nurse , respiratory therapist physicians ICU give time . To make decision plan therapy , clinician need observe , assimilate interpret vast array information originate various device locate bedside multiple patient . Several shortcoming exist technology limit ability : ) fix location monitoring device bedside ; b ) information overload multitude device , display ; c ) lack integration interaction device ; ) use visually cumbersome display , historically create monitoring anesthesia never optimize user ICU ; e ) lack context specific information ( historical trend ) support patient data interpretation clinical decision making . This project propose address challenge ICU monitor develop unified , portable , intelligent device : Monitoring Messenger . By integrate information multiple monitoring device , mechanical ventilator , infusion pump clinical information system mobile device ( tablet PC smart phone ) ; Monitoring Messenger allow nurse , respiratory therapist physicians off-site , continuously monitor critically ill patient , thereby increase patient safety . The propose experiment two part : Part I - Participatory design Part II - Simulation Experiment . In Part I - Participatory Design . Participatory design inter-professional team nurse , physician , designer , engineer , human factor expert follow user-centered design process obtain system requirement , obtain feedback rapid prototyping phase prototype development . While expect result prototype easy use , support decision making , improve awareness patient 's condition health care provider reduce mental workload , methodology hypothesis drive . Part II - Simulation Experiment . In simulated ICU scenario , critical care physician , nurse , respiratory therapist prioritize care critically ill patient . We expect accurately use Monitoring Messenger regular tool ( monitor , paper record etc ) . A potential outcome would decrease mental workload well increase situational awareness .</detailed_description>
