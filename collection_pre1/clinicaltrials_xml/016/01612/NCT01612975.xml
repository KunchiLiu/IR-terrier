	<brief_summary>Following lung resection procedure , patient pleural space drain fluid accumulates due sever proximal vessel like lymph node . The volume fluid pump depend severity inflammation . The investigator conduction study attempt use painkiller intrinsic anti-inflammatory action try reduce degree inflammation patient ' pleural cavity , thus ensure patient discharge faster , great comfort level , hopefully low rate admission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Naproxen Pleural Effusion Formation After Lung Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study investigator attempt reduce degree inflammation ( thus polymorphonuclear leukocyte count ) pleural space follow lung resection procedure administer Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drug ( NSAID ) Naproxen tandem Proton Pump Inhibitor ( PPI ) Pantoprazole , ideally leading towards significantly reduce volume transudate exudate generate . This achieve run placebo-controlled double blind randomize control trial investigator participant blind eliminate experimenter bias . After screen suitable participant use stringent inclusion exclusion criterion , patient administer allied health professional 500mg Naproxen twice daily 40mg Pantoprazole daily , identical placebo four week follow resection surgery . Patients undergo thorough examination schedule follow-up appointment monitor general vitals well possible gastrointestinal complication . The primary outcome significant reduction ( Δ100ml ) chest fluid extract intervention arm study comparison control arm . Secondary outcome include reduction length stay measure day control intervention arm well reduction total number day chest tube retain in-situ . Conditions mortality morbidity , onset complication , general re-admission rate also record .</detailed_description>
