	<brief_title>Diagnostic Tests Help Determine Osteomyelitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteomyelitis present approximately 20 % case foot infection person diabetes [ 1 , 2 ] greatly increase likelihood patient require lower-extremity amputation [ 3 , 4 ] . Early diagnosis treatment drastically improve prognosis . While multiple modality osteomyelitis diagnose , unfortunately definitive method . Bone biopsy histopathological microbiological analysis deem gold standard diagnose osteomyelitis [ 3 , 5 ] . Osteomyelitis consider proven one pathogen culture reliably obtain bone specimen show bone death , acute chronic inflammation reparative response histological examination . However , histological analysis also produce falsely positive result base sample error cause inflammation [ 6 ] . Furthermore , recent study do Meyr et al . highlight discrepancy amongst pathologists leave medical community question validity pathological diagnosis . Microbiological analysis differ base specimen process also dependent sample technique . Often result falsely negative sample error , prior antibiotic therapy , inability culture fastidious organism ; likewise , may falsely positive contamination wound-colonizing flora [ 6 ] . Also , culture superficial swab sample diabetic ulcer sinus tract may adequately identify true bacteriological characteristic diabetic foot osteomyelitis bacterial colonization wound surface microorganisms typically consider pathogenic ( enterococci coagulase-negative staphylococci ) [ 7 ] . Senneville et al . attempted define true correlation culture swab sample culture bone biopsy specimen obtain area osteomyelitis diabetic foot . It find swab culture inaccurate unreliable indicator pathogenic organism chronic diabetic foot osteomyelitis overall poor concordance superficial swab culture bone biopsy culture result microorganisms [ 8 ] . Other method diagnose osteomyelitis include radiographic analysis . On plain film , osteomyelitis suspect one follow radiographic sign observe : periosteal elevation , cortical disruption , medullary involvement , osteolysis , sequestra ( segment necrotic bone separate live bone granulation tissue ) [ 9 ] . Signs osteomyelitis show plain film 10-20 day infection , [ 10 , 11 ] . Dinh et al , meta-analysis radiographic modality , find 54 % sensitivity 68 % specificity detect osteomyelitis plain film versus 90 % sensitivity 79 % specificity MRI [ 12 ] . To investigator ' knowledge , study compare method determine superior test determine osteomyelitis .</detailed_description>
