	<brief_summary>Aromatase inhibitor effective adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) post-menopausal breast cancer patient , proven superiority tamoxifen term disease-free survival , time recurrence , contralateral breast cancer . However , approximately half woman take drug develop significant joint pain , term Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia ( AIA ) . Though medicine take 5 year , joint pain troublesome 13 % may prematurely discontinue arthralgia , thus sacrifice best chance recurrence-free survival . Nonetheless , neither etiology optimal management AIA clearly understand , leave doctor patient rather frustrate . The investigator therefore propose test hypothesis AIA effectively treat new clinical algorithm , effective treatment problem lead improve compliance Aromatase Inhibitor ( AI ) therapy . The algorithm clinical pathway treat AIA incorporates , rational step-wise manner , series intervention base available evidence . Interventions include acupuncture , pain medication , weight bearing exercise , commonly used therapy AIA . The investigator enroll 100 woman begin adjuvant AI therapy ass woman 's baseline joint pain via questionnaire well grip strength measurement . The investigator periodically repeat test AI therapy order systematically quantify characterize AIA . Those woman develop AIA course study place clinical algorithm , investigator observe whether joint pain significantly improve ( measure questionnaire grip strength measurement ) institution algorithm . The investigator also determine whether compliance improve compare historical control , least non-inferior woman study develop AIA . Finally , investigator measure serum estrogen level baseline periodically AI therapy investigate whether dramatic decline estrogen level initiation AI lead significant AIA early time onset . This study target common cause pain among breast cancer survivor aim offer effective treatment strategy alleviate pain improve quality life well medication compliance .</brief_summary>
