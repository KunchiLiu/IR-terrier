	<criteria>For subject enrol study consider index procedure , follow initial inclusion criterion must meet : Age ≥ 18 year Willingness comply study followup requirement Candidate PCI procedure Candidate coronary artery bypass graft surgery Documented evidence stable unstable angina pectoris positive functional ischemia study ( e.g . exercise treadmill test , thallium stress test , SPECT , stress echocardiogram cardiac CT ) Stable angina pectoris define documented Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification I , II , III IV Unstable angina pectoris define documented Braunwald Classification B &amp; C , I , II , III Written inform consent For subject receive investigational stent , follow procedurerelated criterion must meet : De novo restenotic lesion native coronary artery ; restenotic lesion must previously treat standard PTCA ( treatment must &gt; 12 month prior index procedure ) Target lesion must major coronary artery ( target vessel ) . The target vessel include entire territory leave anterior descend artery , leave circumflex artery right coronary artery major side branch artery . A maximum one target lesion one nontarget lesion may treat per subject . The lesion must locate separate coronary artery , treatment nontarget lesion occur first use commercially available therapy ( exception brachytherapy ) . Lesions may one solid lesion series multiple , small lesion treat one lesion Target lesion must treatable single investigational stent ; additional stent may use treat vessel dissection another similar intraprocedure complication ( use investigational stent prefer ) Angiographic evidence ≥ 50 % &lt; 100 % stenosis ( operator visual estimate ) TIMI flow &gt; 1 Target lesion length ≤ 31 mm operator visual estimate Target vessel reference diameter 2.25 mm 4.0 mm operator visual estimate For subject enrol study consider index procedure , follow initial exclusion criterion must present : Baseline LVEF &lt; 30 % ; LVEF may measure assessed standardofcare echocardiography procedure within 90 day index procedure leave ventriculogram prior index procedure ( operator visual assessment ) . PCI vessel 30 day prior index procedure plan within 30 day index procedure Stroke transient ischemic attack within last 6 month prior enrollment Intolerance contrast agent medically manage and/or intolerance antiplatelet , anticoagulant thrombolytic medication Refusal blood transfusion Any medical condition , opinion investigator , pose unacceptable risk implant stent accord study indication Pregnant , plan become pregnant nursing course study . Women childbearing potential must negative blood pregnancy ( beta hCG ) test . Female subject surgically sterile postmenopausal exempt pregnancy test . Known allergy L605 CoCr alloy ( cobalt , chromium , tungsten nickel ) amorphous silicon carbide Life expectancy less one year Participation clinical investigational device drug study . Subjects may concurrently enrol postmarket study , long postmarket study device , drug protocol interfere investigational treatment protocol study . For subject receive investigational stent follow procedurerelated criterion must present : Documented diagnosis acute MI within 72 hour index procedure elevation Troponin CKMB URL ( CKMB measurement require CK normal ) time index procedure ( 99th percentile individual investigative site 's normal reference population ) For subject stable angina elevated Troponin , CKMB &lt; 99 % URL require ECG change consistent acute MI within 72 hour index procedure . ECG change consistent acute MI include : &gt; 1 mm ST segment elevation depression consecutive lead New LBBB Development pathological Qwaves two contiguous lead ECG Acute coronary syndrome baseline Troponin &gt; 99 % URL INR ≥ 1.6 Concomitant renal failure serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Unresolved neutropenia ( white blood cell count &lt; 3,000 / µL ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 / µL ) thrombocytosis ( platelet count &gt; 700,000 / µL ) Unprotected left main CAD ( &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis operator visual estimate ) Target vessel treat PCI procedure ( e.g . PTCA , stent , cut balloon , atherectomy , etc . ) within 12 month prior index procedure Target lesion treat stent , cut balloon atherectomy time prior index procedure treat PTCA within 12 month prior index procedure Target vessel treat brachytherapy anytime prior index procedure Planned PCI target vessel within 9 month index procedure Target vessel nontarget lesion &gt; 50 % stenosis require treatment index procedure Lesions prevent distal perfusion ( TIMI flow 0 1 ) prior wire cross Target lesion leave main coronary artery within 2 mm origin leave anterior descend artery leave circumflex artery operator visual estimate Target lesion locate within saphenous vein graft arterial graft Target lesion involve bifurcation lesion locate major coronary artery involve side branch diameter &gt; 2 mm ( operator visual estimate ) Presence complication follow predilatation target lesion Presence complication follow treatment nontarget lesion ( applicable ) Presence target vessel/lesion excessive tortuousity/angulation severely calcify prevent complete inflation angioplasty balloon Angiographic evidence thrombus within target lesion Target lesion locate within aneurysm associate aneurysm vessel segment either proximal distal target lesion Use cutting balloon , atherectomy ablative device immediately prior investigational stent placement</criteria>
