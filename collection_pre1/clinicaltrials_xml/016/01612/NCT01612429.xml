	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate effect amino acid supplementation structure certain protein blood dialysis patient . Patients end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) usually high level urea may interact blood protein change structure process know carbamylation . The investigator interested determine whether carbamylation link adverse outcome dialysis patient hypothesize supplementation balance formulation amino acid reduce amount carbamylation occur . In study , dialysis patient ( n= 30 ) receive intravenous supplementation FDA-approved amino acid solution ( NephrAmine® , 5.4 % amino acid ) regular dialysis session ( 3 time weekly 6 week ) . During 6 week therapy 2 week follow-up , blood drawn patient ' exist hemodialysis access port ( ~60 ml total per month ) measure level carbamylated albumin , amino acid , standard laboratory value . Patients closely monitor safety tolerability amino acid therapy . For treated subject , follow additional individual receiving treatment serve control ( intervention ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As human kidney function decline ability excrete urea , chief end product nitrogen metabolism . Though elevated blood urea level denote loss kidney function , may also serve source pathophysiological consequence kidney failure . Urea spontaneously dissociate form cyanate , unprotonated form react protein amino group process know carbamylation . Carbamylation-induced protein alteration may involve progression various disease change structure , charge , function enzyme , hormone , receptor , amino acid . For example , proteins diverse collagen low density lipoprotein ( LDLs ) , show induce characteristic biochemical event atherosclerosis progression carbamylated . Our research seek examine protein carbamylation contribute pathological sequelae end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) determine novel therapeutic attenuate process . Percent carbamylated albumin level use measure overall carbamylation burden . Our preliminary work show negative correlation subject ' percent carbamylated albumin level circulate amino acid , suggest free amino acid may active scavenger reactive isocyanate . Furthermore , ex vivo study show amino acid supplementation attenuate carbamylation reaction occur . To good ass biologic pathway affect carbamylation dialysis patient bring discovery closer clinical therapeutic application , aim conduct pilot study evaluate effect amino acid supplementation carbamylation participant ESRD undergo maintenance hemodialysis . We believe elevate urea amino acid deficiency may play dominant role carbamylation proteins ESRD protein carbamylation may modifiable amino acid therapy . The propose pilot study directly assess concept . The specific aim study evaluate effect amino acid supplementation carbamylation ESRD patient undergo maintenance hemodialysis : ( 1 ) evaluate safe optimal amino acid supplement dosing ( 2 ) investigate effect amino acid supplementation plasma carbamylated albumin level .</detailed_description>
