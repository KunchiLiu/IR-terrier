	<brief_summary>Rationale : Acromegaly clinical syndrome result excess growth hormone ( GH ) . Craniofacial hand disproportion due soft tissue swell new bone formation highly prevalent patient active acromegaly . Besides cosmetic aspect , change impair quality life significant morbidity respect oral , maxillofacial hand pathology well respiratory problem sleep apnea change speech . At present unclear craniofacial hand disproportion , sleep apnea speech change ( partially ) reversible successful treatment . Therefore consensus information patient give ( partial ) recovery facial hand disproportion treatment follow-up respect oral , maxillofacial , respiratory hand pathology organize . Facial hand analysis use 3D stereophotograph 3D fusion model 3D stereophotograph 3D skull reconstruction via cone beam compute tomography ( CT ) -scan make possible investigate craniofacial change due acromegaly facial dimension together ( dentition , bone soft tissue ) relational proportion facial structure . 3D stereophotography soft tissue hand . Combined disease specific general quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires , correlation quality life craniofacial hand disproportion determine . Combined sleep- speech analysis , correlation sleep apnea , speech craniofacial disproportion determine . Primary objective : To investigate change facial- hand analysis patient acromegaly result medical treatment pituitary surgery , investigate change relational proportion facial- hand structure , incidence severity sleep apnea , incidence severity speech change QOL . Study design : prospective case-control study . Study population : Approximately thirty patient newly diagnose acromegaly . The result facial hand analysis , sleep apnea research speech analysis patient group different phase disease compare result healthy control group . Main study parameters/endpoints : Parameters facial analysis 3D stereophotography cone beam CT hand analysis 3D stereophotography , biochemical parameter disease activity , disease relate QOL assess 2 validated QOL questionnaire ( , AcroQol RAND-36 ) , speech analysis , result voice handicap index questionnaire severity sleep apnea assess complete overnight polysomnography Epworth sleepiness scale questionnaire . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : As result participate study , subject undergo cone beam CT . The cone beam CT associate exposure X-ray radiation 0.069-0.135mSv . This amount radiation amount background radiation person receive 7 day time daily life . No adverse effect expect amount exposure . The investigation take 10-70 minute adjacent every regular outpatient clinic visit . In addition , polysomnography , subject investigate overnight one three time 2,5 year , depend result first screen polysomnography . Assessment change body appearance , sleep disturbance , speech change QOL prospective longitudinal fashion increase knowledge impact disease patient perception well-being functioning help u refine treatment goal patient acromegaly</brief_summary>
