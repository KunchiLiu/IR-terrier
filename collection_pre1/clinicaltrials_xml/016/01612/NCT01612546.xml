	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study cyclodextrin-based nanopharmaceutical CRLX101 treat patient advanced metastatic stomach , gastroesophageal , esophageal cancer progress least one prior regimen chemotherapy remove surgery . CRLX101 delivers cytotoxic topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin tumor cell hypothesize interrupt growth tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial CRLX101 Treatment Patients With Advanced Metastatic Stomach , Gastroesophageal , Esophageal Cancer That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pre- post-treatment biopsy ass CRLX101 ( cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 ) nanoparticle 20 ( S ) -Camptothecin ( CPT ) uptake tumor normal tissue . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity CRLX101 patient population . II . To examine antitumor efficacy CRLX101 advance gastric/gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) /esophageal squamous adenocarcinoma include clinical benefit rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) 4 month overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease well , may receive treatment additional 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly .</detailed_description>
