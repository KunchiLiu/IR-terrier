	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : This study evaluate effective strategy achieve HIV virologic suppression among HIV-infected substance user recruit hospital setting randomly assign one three treatment condition : 1 ) Patient Navigator ( PN ) ; 2 ) Patient Navigator + Contingency Management ( PN+CM ) ; 3 ) Treatment Usual ( TAU ) . Primary Hypothesis : The rate viral suppression ( plasma HIV viral load &lt; = 200 copies/mL ) relative non-suppression all-cause mortality 3 study group differ 12 month follow-up . Sub-hypothesis 1 . The rate virologic suppression ( plasma HIV viral load &lt; = 200 copies/mL ) PN+CM group great TAU group . Sub-hypothesis 2 . The rate virologic suppression PN+CM group great PN group . Sub-hypothesis 3 . The rate virologic suppression PN group great TAU group . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effect experimental intervention : HIV virological suppression CD4 T-cell count change 6 month post-randomization ; engagement HIV primary care visit attendance ; rate hospitalization . 2 . To evaluate effect experimental intervention : drug use frequency severity ; drug use treatment engagement session attendance . 3 . To assess select mechanisms action intervention ( .i.e . mediator intervention effect ) . 4 . To assess potential characteristic associate differential treatment effectiveness ( i.e . moderator intervention effect ) . 5 . To evaluate incremental cost cost-effectiveness intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 3-arm randomize , prospective trial HIV-infected inpatient report substance use screen randomize 1:1:1 ratio Patient Navigator ( PN ) v . Patient Navigator + Contingency Management ( PN+CM ) v . Treatment Usual ( TAU ) . Randomization occur screen , informed consent , baseline assessment collection biological ( blood ) specimens . Participants assign PN PN+CM group meet ( ideally bedside participant still hospitalize time randomization ) Patient Navigator interventionist complete 11 intervention session 6-month-long intervention period . Participants assign TAU group receive care typically offer inpatient setting . Follow-up visit conduct approximately 6 12 month post-randomization . To minimize patient staff burden , site may implement pre-screening procedure permission respective IRBs determine inpatient would meet study 's AIDS-defining illness/CD4 count/viral load inclusion criterion . Pre-screening , screening , enrollment , assessment , randomization initial intervention visit ( ideally ) occur participant 's stay inpatient facility . Recognizing participant may recruit various stage illness inpatient visit , however , may possible . To allow maximum flexibility , activity occur screen inform consent may complete patient discharge hospital . The intervention duration 6 month session ideally occur weekly first month , bi-weekly month 2 3 monthly month 4- 6 . Follow-up visit occur approximately 6 12 month post-randomization . Therefore , total duration individual participation study approximately 12 month . Prior approach patient recruit study , member medical team within hospital ( i.e. , attend physician , fellow , resident nurse practitioner ) involve patient care know patient ' HIV-infected status ass medical stability patient . If patient express interest potentially participate research deem medically stable , study staff member meet patient bedside discus study . Strict ethical guideline regard professional conduct confidentiality enforce study staff . Prior screen individual determine eligibility participate , research staff briefly explain study purpose , procedure , potential risk benefit voluntary nature participation . Individuals willing screen determine eligibility provide write informed consent , include provide HIPAA authorization medical record abstraction . After sign consent HIPAA form , participant offer copy form keep record . After enrollment process ( provide write informed consent complete locator form ) complete brief rapport-building discussion interviewer participant take place , research interviewer administer baseline assessment handheld Computer Assisted Personal Interview ( CAPI ) device . The CAPI system display assessment question computer monitor , allow interviewer read question enter participant ' response directly computer . The baseline assessment include , limited question participant demographic , HIV care , medication adherence , substance use co morbid condition hepatitis , depression , etc . Collection Biologic Specimens : We collect blood specimen baseline , 6-month 12-month follow-up visit evaluate primary outcome , HIV virologic suppression , well measure CD4 count , complete blood count ( CBC ) . Blood specimen process do site ' local laboratory . In event blood specimen collect reason ( e.g. , vein `` dry '' , participant lose follow-up , etc . ) result collect specimen available ( e.g. , enough specimen draw , lab processing error , etc . ) , study team may abstract use non-study lab result purpose evaluate HIV virologic suppression outcome measure CD4 count CBC . Participants randomize intervention group may also provide urine drug screening . Randomization : Participants randomize 1:1:1 fashion one 3 treatment group . Randomization stratify site . The randomization procedure conduct centralized process Data Statistical Center ( DSC2 ) . After baseline assessment successfully complete , designate study staff member perform randomization . Randomization participant do Internet use Enrollment Module AdvantageEDC ( study electronic data capture system ) . Study Interventions : The 3 treatment conditions/study group : 1 ) Patient Navigator intervention ( PN ) , 2 ) Patient Navigator plus Contingency Management ( PN+CM ) intervention 3 ) Treatment Usual ( TAU ) . The patient navigator ( PN ) approach include five function : 1 ) establish effective working relationship ; 2 ) encourage identification use strength , ability asset ; 3 ) support client control goal set search need resource ; 4 ) view community resource identify informal source support ; 5 ) conduct case management active community base activity . Specifically , patient navigator provide follow study participant randomize PN group : 1 ) four initial meeting , ideally first one hospitalization three within first 3 week hospital discharge , 2 ) initial four meeting , patient navigator meet PN group participant ideally twice monthly month 2 3 month 4 - 6 . Study participant randomize patient navigator plus contingency management ( PN+CM ) group receive patient navigation ( PN ) intervention outline Section 11.2 sponsor protocol combine contingency management ( CM ) . For participant randomly assign PN+CM study group , patient navigator : 1 ) effectively communicate incentive plan participant , 2 ) track seven target behavior may earn participant incentive , 3 ) verify occurrence target behavior , 4 ) deliver incentive accord protocol , 5 ) maintain record incentives deliver . Participants assign treatment usual ( TAU ) group receive standard treatment provide participate site link patient HIV substance use care . Follow-up visit conduct approximately 6- 12-months post-randomization involve follow-up CAPIs blood collection .</detailed_description>
