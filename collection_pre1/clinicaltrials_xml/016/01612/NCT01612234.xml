	<brief_summary>High intake saturate fat associate diabetes . Our work show two common fatty acid North American diet , palmitic acid ( saturate fat ) oleic acid ( monounsaturated fat ) metabolize differently opposite effect fat burning . The propose study examine biochemical molecular mechanism high saturate fat diet versus low saturate fat/high monounsaturated fat diet alters action hormone , insulin , skeletal muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saturated Fat Versus Monounsaturated Fat Insulin Action</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palmitic acid ( PA ) , impairs insulin sensitivity skeletal muscle , replace PA diet oleic acid ( OA ) , monounsaturated fatty acid ( FA ) , may beneficial . The first objective project understand effect lipid metabolism skeletal muscle lipid composition , insulin signaling , inflammatory signal two common variation FA composition diet : ( 1 ) The typical intake North America PA OA present equal proportion ( HI PA diet ) . ( 2 ) The Mediterranean FA composition PA much low OA much high ( HI OA diet ) . PA may induce insulin resistance skeletal muscle cell via accumulation lipid within muscle cell via activation inflammatory signal . The second objective project ass hypothesis high intake PA down-regulate one-carbon ( initial ) oxidation , lead increased inflammatory signal decreased insulin signal . However , literature evidence FA may induce defect insulin signaling , FA completely oxidize ; therefore , third objective ass hypothesis high PA diet may decrease complete oxidation FA possibly accelerate initial FA oxidation . A double-masked , cross-over trial effect high PA diet versus high OA/low PA diet 16 overweight obese subject 16 lean subject ( age 18 - 40 yr ) conduct investigate follow Specific Aims : 1 . To test hypothesis increase intake PA cause decrease rate [ 1-13C ] -PA oxidation associate : ( ) increase inflammatory signaling , within muscle peripheral blood mononuclear cell ; ( b ) Decreased insulin signal characterize decrease , whole body , peripheral insulin sensitivity ( euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp ) , skeletal muscle , decrease phospho-AKT ( Ser473 ) , increase phospho-IRS-1 ( Ser636/Ser639 ) , decrease tyrosine phosphorylation IRS-1 , decrease membrane content GLUT4 . 2 . To test hypothesis increase intake PA cause less complete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation , perhaps associate dysfunction TCA cycle increase reactive oxygen specie formation . This hypothesis test measuring whole body muscle ( upper limb ) relative rate oxidation [ 13-13C ] -PA [ 1-13C ] -PA determine serum profile acylcarnitines , urine concentration organic acid , muscle concentration protein carbonyl . 3 . To test hypothesis high PA diet lead less complete oxidation FA , less insulin signal skeletal muscle response test meal , less whole body insulin sensitivity , increase dysfunction TCA cycle , great reactive oxygen specie formation compare result obtain obese versus lean human .</detailed_description>
