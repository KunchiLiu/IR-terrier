	<brief_summary>This study do find whether nutritional supplement , call BioResponse-DIM ( BR-DIM [ oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane ] ) , improve survival woman residual cancer cell follow surgery chemotherapy breast cancer . BR-DIM active ingredient cruciferous vegetable ( broccoli , brussels sprout cauliflower ) . Consumption vegetable associate decreased risk several cancer . Researchers also hope find whether different biomarkers ( also call `` marker '' ) blood predict chance breast cancer return . BR-DIM think effective treating stage II-III breast cancer triple negative , AR positive ( + ) , residual cancer cell breast chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
