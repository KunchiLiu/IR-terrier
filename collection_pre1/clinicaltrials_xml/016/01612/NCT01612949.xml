	<brief_summary>The aim project develop computer algorithm accurately predict easy difficult intubate patient base upon digital photograph three different perspective . Such application provide consistent , quantitative measure intubation difficulty analyze facial feature capture photographs - feature previously show correlate easy hard would perform intubation procedure . This contrast establish subjective protocol also serve predict intubation difficulty , albeit low accuracy . A digital application potential decrease potential complication relate intubation difficulty increase patient safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Both control experimental cohort recruit study . In order drive clinical acceptance technique , investigator need study demonstrate applicability patient regardless race gender . This require recruitment control population patient demonstrate surgery easy intubate . Such patient relative abundance . The experimental group consist patient find surgery difficult intubate . Patients define easy intubate anesthetic record describe single attempt Macintosh 3 blade result grade 1 laryngoscopic view ( full exposure vocal cord ) . Difficult intubation define least one : one attempt operator least one year anesthesia experience , grade 3 4 laryngoscopic view 4 point scale , 5 need second operator , non-elective use alternative airway device bougie , fiberoptic bronchoscope intubate laryngeal mask airway . The primary purpose study develop algorithm capable discriminating patient likely difficult intubate likely easy intubate base facial appearance . The primary analysis demonstration statistical significance ability derive algorithms determine successfully whether subject easy difficult intubate . A secondary analysis demonstration statistical difference performance derive algorithms versus conventional airway assessment test .</detailed_description>
