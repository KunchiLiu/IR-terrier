	<brief_summary>In investigator vascular practice , either fluoroscopic- ultrasound-guided technique routinely use obtain femoral arterial access . Ultrasound-guidance frequently use patient weak absent pulse , know abnormal vascular anatomy , need bypass graft puncture , ensure accurate arterial puncture patient expect receive large dos blood-thinning medication procedure . For practitioner experience ultrasound-guided access technique , consider highly accurate easy use ; thus , physician routinely use tool . A well-designed study need truly assess accuracy ultrasound technique determine whether may reduce complication arterial access vascular patient . By demonstrate safe , accurate efficient technique obtain arterial access catheter-based procedure , investigator could significantly reduce morbidity mortality associate complication arterial puncture . Length hospital stay , management cost patient discomfort could reduce minimize complication rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Versus Fluoroscopically-guided Arterial Access Non-cardiac Vascular Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arterial access account high frequency complication catheter-based procedure U.S . In vascular practice , ultrasound-guidance frequently use patient weak absent pulse , know aberrant vascular anatomy , need graft puncture , ensure accurate arterial puncture patient expect receive large dos anti-thrombotic medication . Some practitioner routinely use modality . The purpose study determine whether real-time ultrasound guidance superior fluoroscopic guidance obtain successful arterial cannulation diagnostic interventional catheter-based procedure primarily non-cardiac vascular patient population . Patients randomize receive either real-time ultrasound-guided arterial access fluoroscopic-guided access . Baseline patient demographic , co-morbidities , medication , pertinent laboratory data , indication procedure record . Procedural data record include procedure type , type access , operator , pulse quality , sheath size , closure device , angiographic data access artery , antithrombotic medication use , intra-procedural activate clot time . Primary endpoint successful arterial cannulation angiographic imaging . Secondary end point time access , number attempt , accidental venipuncture , first pas success , complication rate hospital length stay . Data regard complication ( patient history , examination , laboratory image study ) include period 90 day procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients great 18 year age undergoing noncardiac catheterbased diagnostic interventional procedure require femoral artery cannulation . This include patient comorbid condition coronary artery disease cardiac health problem . 1 . Patients le 18 year age . 2 . Patients enrol another IRB approve biomedical study . 3 . Pregnant female . 4 . Prisoners .</criteria>
