	<brief_summary>Aim Study : Adverse effect noise pollution operation theatres throughly demonstrate . We assess impact noise reduction program paediatric surgery . Methods : A prospective control study 156 operation perform 16 surgeon conduct . The sound level noise reduction program base education , rule technical device ( Sound Ear tm ) assess . Endpoints spatially resolve sound level match surgeon 's biometric ( saliva cortisol , electrodermal activity ) behavioural stress response ( questionnaire ) . These correlated mission protocol NoiSeQ individual noise sensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We record median noise level control vs. interventional group include count peak event different tresholds . Three phase conduct : 1 . Reference group/phase I 2 . Control group/phase II The full data set record research clerk present theatre however staff leave unaware study purpose 3 . Intervention group/phase III . The intervention consist panel work rule include mainly communication regulation ( conversation concern current case allow , surgery , mobile phone ban etc.. Measures back intervention conference , poster pictograms . . A wear off-effect sought . Biometrically , analyze surgeon 's pre- postoperative rise cortisol proportion surgeon 's electrodermal potential &gt; 15ÂµS indicate severe stress . Intra-team communication , decrease disturb conversation sudden noise peak investigate correlate individual noise sensitivity determine noise Q questionnaire .</detailed_description>
