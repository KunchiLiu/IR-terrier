	<brief_summary>Cat allergy major trigger asthma . Therapies develop control allergic response cat . We interested measure type white blood cell link cat allergy , help u understand use new therapy people suffer cat allergy asthma . We study cat-allergic individual stable , mild asthma expose cat allergen . We measure various white blood cell , include cell link cat allergy , determine whether number cell change follow cat exposure . These cell measure blood bone marrow remove sample use needle . These cell also measure lung insert bronchoscope airway draw fluid contain cell . This study improve understand harmful versus protective role cat-specific cell , allow development well drug treatment asthma trigger cat exposure .</brief_summary>
