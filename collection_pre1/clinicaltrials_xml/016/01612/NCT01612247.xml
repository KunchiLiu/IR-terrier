	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm , clinical stage IIIII invasive breast cancer prior neoadjuvant therapy ( CTEP Simplified Disease Classification 10021980 10006190 ) . Patients may male female , premenopausal postmenopausal . Tumor may ER/PR positive negative . Margins must negative , follow exception : microscopic positive anterior margin adjacent skin allow . Patients must receive chemotherapy prior definitive surgery . Any preoperative chemotherapy regimen acceptable , exception antiangiogenic agent . Patients must residual invasive breast cancer breast and/or axillary lymph node pathology time surgery ( pathologic CR ) . All following clinical response acceptable : partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) . Patients may receive hormonal therapy concurrently study therapy . Hormonal therapy , give , start 4 week prior initiation study treatment order avoid confound effect correlative study . Age &gt; 18 year . Because breast cancer extremely rare age group , child exclude study . Median life expectancy great 2 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 K/cmm platelet &gt; 100 K/cmm total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal No clinical evidence brain metastasis . Patients must QTc &lt; 500 msec electrocardiogram . Patients must LVEF within institutional normal limit baseline . Patients New York Heart Association Class I II functional capacity eligible . The following group patient eligible provided New York Heart Association Class II ( NYHA ; see Appendix B ) cardiac function time baseline ECHO/MUGA : The follow group patient eligible provided New York Heart Association Class A B Patients must register within 180 day definitive surgery . Treatment must start within one week registration , Because chemotherapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients may chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study must recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive antineoplastic investigational agent concurrently study treatment exception hormonal therapy . Patients HER2 positive breast cancer exclude . History allergic reaction attribute aspirin agent use study . Patients may begin study treatment radiotherapy , may begin immediately complete radiotherapy treatment . Patients may receive prior bevacizumab , antiangiogenic agent ( e.g. , sorafenib , pazopanib , AZD2171 , PTK787 , VEGF Trap , etc. ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients hypertension control medication ( &gt; 160/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) eligiblePatients poorly control hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg high diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg high ) ineligible . Patients chronic aspirin therapy , antiplatelet agent , anticoagulation agent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) dose exclude . Patients take drug intermittently must willing abstain duration study treatment . Patients condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease ) impair ability swallow retain oral medication exclude . Patients follow condition exclude : Prior history gastrointestinal central nervous system bleeding , document selfreported blood stool bright red blood per rectum Recent ( within 12 month ) history clinically significant bleed Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment . Any history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack within 12 month prior study entry . History myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , stable/unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft stenting within 12 month prior study entry . History pulmonary embolism within past 12 month . Abnormal LVEF objective measurement . Measurement require unless clinically indicate , patient exclude LVEF document abnormal . Class III IV heart failure define NYHA functional classification system ( see Appendix B ) . Pregnant woman exclude study cyclophosphamide methotrexate chemotherapeutic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother aspirin , cyclophosphamide methotrexate , breastfeed occur study treatment . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Patients prior history breast cancer , malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer within past five year , exclude recurrence cancer could affect exploratory secondary endpoint trial . Known HIVpositive patient exclude increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
