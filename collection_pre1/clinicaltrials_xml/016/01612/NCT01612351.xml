	<brief_title>Multimodality Risk Adapted Tx Including Induction Chemo SCCHN Amenable Transoral Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm non-randomized two-stage phase II trial previously untreated patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) arise oral cavity , oropharynx , supraglottic larynx amenable transoral surgical approach . Treatment consist 3 part : neoadjuvant induction weekly carboplatin paclitaxel combination daily lapatinib 6 week ( PART 1 ) prior transoral surgery ( PART 2 ) . Post-operative treatment ( PART 3 ) vary depend risk category assign patient follow surgery follow : treatment treatment limit involved field radiation ( low risk ) , ipsilateral radiation concurrent weekly chemotherapy ( medium risk ) ; cisplatin every 3 week daily lapatinib concurrent bilateral radiation ( high risk ) .</detailed_description>
