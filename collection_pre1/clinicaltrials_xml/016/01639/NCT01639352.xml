	<brief_summary>The hypothesis clinical trial hepatocellular carcinoma contain somatostatin receptor make sensitive inhibitory effect new somatostatin analog , SOM230 . This analog great broad bind affinity somatostatin receptor compare current drug use , sandostatin LAR . Thus , SOM230 potential effective treatment patient hepatocellular carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis unresectable HCC either : Histopathology Elevated serum AFP &gt; 400 ng/ml finding magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) CT scan characteristic primary liver tumor . Findings MRI CT scan characteristic primary liver tumor patient cirrhosis Tumors least 1 cm great 2 . Age ≥ 18 year . 3 . Minimum four week since major surgery , completion radiation , completion prior systemic anticancer therapy ( adequately recover acute toxicity prior therapy ) . 4 . Patients may progress sorafenib refused intolerant sorafenib . A maximum 2 prior line systemic therapy ( include chemotherapy target therapy ) allow . Prior locoregional therapy surgery , radiofrequency ablation transarterial chemoembolization also allow ( count systemic therapy ) , provide progression document therapy , least 4 week elapse since last therapy . 5 . Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) 80 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 6 . Life expectancy 12 week . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.2 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 50 x 10^9/L 8 . Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN serum transaminases activity ≤ 3 x ULN . Serum PT = &lt; 16 second . 9 . Adequate renal function show serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . 10 . Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation ( start one day initiation lipid lower drug ) appropriate lipid lower medication . 11 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day administration first study treatment . Women must lactate . Both men woman childbearing potential must advise importance use effective birth control measure course study . 12 . Signed informed consent participate study must obtain patient fully inform nature potential risk investigator ( his/her designee ) aid write information . 13 . Child 's A early Child 's B ( 7 point Child Pugh Classification ) . 14 . Measurable disease CT scan contrast . If evaluable disease measurable disease previously treat , must show sign tumor progression CT. Measurable disease evaluable disease define RECISTguidelines ( see section 9.0 ) . 15 . Patients cirrhosis either radiologically pathology finding either CT scan MRI characteristic primary liver cancer eligible . 1 . Prior octreotide therapy somatostatin analog . 2 . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent . 3 . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine study period within 1 week study entry ( ie . within 1 week signing informed consent ) . 4 . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . 5 . Patients prior concurrent malignancy except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated situ cancer , cancer patient disease free five year . 6 . Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( define HgA1c &gt; 7 % =8 % despite therapy ) fast plasma glucose &gt; 1.5 ULN . Note : At principle investigator 's discretion , noneligible patient rescreened adequate medical therapy institute . 7 . Patients symptomatic cholelithiasis 8 . Patients congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant bradycardia , advanced heart block history acute myocardial infarction within six month precede enrollment . 9 . Patients high risk cardiac arrhythmia define follow : Baseline QTcF &gt; 470 msec History syncope family history idiopathic sudden death long QT syndrome Sustained clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Risk factor Torsades de Pointes hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , cardiac failure , clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia , highgrade AV block Concomitant disease ( ) could prolong QT autonomic neuropathy ( cause uncontrolled diabetes , Parkinson 's disease ) , HIV , uncontrolled hypothyroidism cardiac failure Concomitant medication ( ) know increase QT interval ( see Appendix II ) 10 . Patients presence active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection history immunocompromise , include positive HIV test result ( ELISA Western blot ) . 11 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Severely impaired lung function Any active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled infection/ disorder . Nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize treatment study therapy 12 . Women pregnant breast feeding , women/men able conceive unwilling practice effective method birth control . ( Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior administration pasireotide ) . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . 13 . Known hypersensitivity somatostatin analogue component pasireotide octreotide LAR formulation 14 . History noncompliance medical regimen 15 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol unable give inform consent . 16 . Patients baseline ALT AST &gt; 3x ULN . 17 . Patients baseline serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN . 18 . PT &gt; 16 second and/or PTT &gt; 1.5 x ULN 19 . History current alcohol misuse/abuse within past 12 month . 20 . Known gallbladder bile duct disease , acute chronic pancreatitis .</criteria>
