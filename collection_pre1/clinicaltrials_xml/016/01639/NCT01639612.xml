	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose Study - This protocol aim demonstrate feasibility safety autologous ALD-451 cell administer intravenously World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade IV malignant glioma patient follow surgery , radiation therapy temozolomide ; well obtain initial description effect ALD-451 cell neuro-cognition allow design subsequent phase 2 trial intervention patient malignant glioma . The primary objective study demonstrate safety intravenously administer autologous bone marrow derive ALD-451 cell brain follow surgery , radiation therapy temozolomide patient WHO grade IV malignant glioma . The secondary objective study determine recovery ALD-451 bone marrow patient follow radiation therapy temozolomide . The exploratory objective study determine intravenous administration autologous ALD-451 cell follow surgery , radiation therapy temozolomide WHO grade IV malignant glioma patient may effect subsequent deterioration neurocognition patient-reported outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Bone Marrow/Stem Cells Grade IV Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot , open label study eligible subject undergo surgery , radiation therapy , Temozolomide , bone marrow harvest , MRIs , intravenous infusion ALD-451 . The subject follow via safety efficacy procedure complete visit 12 month . Two 8 week follow gross total resection ( GTR ) , patient WHO grade IV malignant glioma agree participate study signing inform consent undergo screening procedure determine eligibility . Once enrolled study , baseline neurocognitive testing perform . Two 8 week enrol subject complete 6 -6 ½ week radiation therapy daily temozolomide , subject bone marrow harvest undergo bone marrow aspiration 160 ( +/-20 ) mL bone marrow collect iliac crest ( one 2 day patient re-assessed continued eligibility ) . The sample transport Robertson CT2 GMP Facility ALD-451 manufacture ALD-451 product return Investigational Chemotherapy Services infusion . A small aliquot ALD-451 take start bone marrow , de-identified , labeled manufacturing lot number , store Duke University duration trial support ongoing study determine potency product . For ALD-451 product , retain aliquot equivalent 10 ml start bone marrow cryopreserved stored vapor phase liquid nitrogen . Harvest 160 mL subject bone marrow allow retains without excessive reduction anticipate ALDHbr dose . These frozen retains use product characterization development potency assay . These aliquot use purpose remain aliquot destroyed time Biologics License Application ( BLA ) approval . Two - four day bone marrow harvest ALDHbr cell , ALD-451 administer peripheral IV , 1 hour . This follow 4 hour IV fluid observation . Normal Saline use IV fluid initiate minute administration ALD-451 . The bag within ALD-451 receive flushed 10 ml Normal Saline fluid obtain flush bag administer patient , assure investigator reinfused patient vast majority ALD-451 present bag . Temozolomide reinitiated four week completion radiation therapy daily Temozolomide ( least two week ALD-451 infusion ) . Temozolomide dose 150 mg/m2 orally day 1-5 28-day cycle first cycle 200 mg/m2 orally follow 11 cycle . Patients receive total 12 cycle Temozolomide follow completion radiation therapy . Neurocognitive test patient-reported outcome obtain study enrollment , two week completion radiation therapy temozolomide six twelve cycle temozolomide .</detailed_description>
