	<brief_summary>Background : - Assessing pain level important improve treatment different illness . Most pain rating scale use determine pain level adult . Pain also common symptom among child cancer . Those genetic condition may lead cancer may also pain symptom . However , pain scale use adult fully test child young adult . As result , may accurate . Researchers want test pain rating scale child young adult cancer genetic condition lead cancer . Objectives : - To study effectiveness pain rating scale give child young adult cancer relate genetic condition . Eligibility : - Children , adolescent , young adult 6 25 year age cancer genetic condition lead cancer . - Parents participate child also eligible . Design : - Participants cancer relate genetic condition fill four questionnaire . These questionnaire ask pain level much pain interferes daily life . - Parents fill two questionnaire child pain level much pain interferes child life . - Pain treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Pain common symptom among child variety medical illness . Currently , number rating scale use assess pain interference pain severity adult . However , relatively measure assess variable validate use child adolescent , exist tool limitation . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective validate self-report parent version Pain Interference Index ( PII ) Pain Rating Scale ( PRS ) comparison previously validate measure pain interference ( Modified Brief Pain Inventory ) pain severity ( Faces Pain Scale - Revised ) child , adolescent , young adult age 8 25 year cancer , neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) , genetic tumor predisposition syndrome ( GTPS ) , parent , adult cancer , NF1 , GTPS , Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . Secondary objective include collect data reliability PII PRS , establish normative data , determine feasibility use PII PRS child age 6 7 year . ELIGIBILITY : Eligible pediatric participant must : 1 . Have diagnosis NF1 , GTPS , leukemia , malignant solid tumor ( include sarcoma , neuroblastoma melanoma ) 6 25 year age , enrol NCI clinical trial natural history study , parent guardian willing complete correspond parent measure OR 2 . Have diagnosis cancer , NF1 , GTPS , Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) , 18 year age old , see NIH . DESIGN : Fifty-four patient solid tumor , NF1 leukemia age 8 25 108 parent patient , 69 patient SCD ask respond one time PII PRS , well Modified Brief Pain Inventory Faces Pain Scale - Revised schedule clinic visit primary NCI protocol , inpatient . In addition , demographic ( patient gender age , parent gender ( applicable ) medical ( diagnosis , date diagnosis , pain medication ) data collect review patient medical record . Parents participate patient ask complete Parent version PII Parent PRS . Correlations patient parent questionnaire result patient solid tumor , NF1 , GTPS , leukemia correlate establish validity reliability PII PRS . Also , result mother father report correlate assess inter-rater reliability . Data 12 patient age 6 7 year collect determine feasibility form young age group . A subset evaluable patient SCD ( n=28 ) ask repeat PII approximately 1 month assess test-retest reliability tool .</detailed_description>
