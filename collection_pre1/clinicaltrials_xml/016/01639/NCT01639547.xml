	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect PEGASYS® ( peginterferon alfa-2a 40KD ) plus Robatrol® ( ribavirin ) combination therapy give 36 week versus 48 week clearance HCV viremia 24 week treatment end</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sustained Virological Response ( SVR ) Rate Pegasys Plus Ribavirin Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin brings good therapeutic response curability . However , adverse effect suffering lot . Response-guided , personalized treatment current principle . In patient CHC , GT1 PR treatment 24 week establish rapid virologic responder ( RVR ) low viral load treatment . As patient RVR high viral load ( HVL ) , treatment duration 48 week patient complete early virologic response ( cEVR ) . Is short duration treatment feasible good virokinetic response ? The ideal treatment duration patient chronic hepatitis C , GT-1 , high viral load RVR enough data yet . Is really necessary double treatment duration ( 48 week ) patient chronic hepatitis C , GT-1 , high viral load RVR ? Is 36-week adequate ? A multicenter trial INDIV-2 present EASL 2010 . They treat CHC patient naïve GT1 HVL RVR 30 week get similarly good SVR treat 48 week ( 85 % vs. 82 % ) . Therefore , investigator design randomize control study investigate SVR rate treatment 36 week 48 week patient CHC , GT1 , HVL RVR .</detailed_description>
