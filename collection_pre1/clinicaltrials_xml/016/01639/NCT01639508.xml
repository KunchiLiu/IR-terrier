	<brief_summary>The purpose phase II study find effect cabozantinib ( XL184 ) , good and/or bad , patient whose tumor one follow gene change RET , ROS1 , NTRK fusion , increase MET AXL activity . A phase II study look effective medication treat specific type cancer collect information side effect study treatment . RET , ROS1 , NTRK fusion increase MET AXL activity gene lead lung cancer cell growth . Cabozantinib oral medicine inhibits RET , ROS1 , NTRK , MET , AXL . In addition , drug interferes cell pathway also cause cancer cell grow , form new blood vessel , spread organ body . The goal use cabozantinib shrink cancer prevent grow Cabozantinib study show cause cancer shrinkage cancer medullary thyroid cancer prostate cancer . We thus good idea side-effects cause anticipate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject must fully meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . The subject pathologic diagnosis nonsmall cell lung carcinoma metastatic unresectable . 2 . Documented presence : Group A : KIF5B/RET relate variant RET fusion . Group B : follow aberration ii . NTRK fusion iii . MET overexpression , amplification , mutation iv . AXL overexpression , amplification , mutation Group C : ROS1 infustion 3 . The subject ≥ 18 year old day consent . 4 . The subject Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % . 5 . The subject organ marrow function laboratory value follow : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 without colony stimulate factor support 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 3 . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For subject know Gilbert 's . disease , bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL 4 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 30 mL/min . For creatinine clearance estimation , Cockcroft Gault equation use : Male : CrCl ( mL/min ) = ( 140 age ) × wt ( kg ) / ( serum creatinine × 72 ) Female : Multiply result 0.85 5 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN liver involvement , ≤ 5 × ULN liver involvement 6 . Urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) ≤ 1 mg/mg ( 113.2 mg/mmol ) creatinine 24hr urine protein &lt; 1 g 7 . Serum phosphorus , magnesium , potassium ≥ LLN adequate supplementation necessary 8 . The subject capable understanding comply protocol requirement sign informed consent document . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( eg , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . 9 . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . 10 . Postmenopause define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month . Note : woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression reversible reason . 1 . Any type systemic anticancer agent ( include investigational ) within 3 week first dose study treatment , within 5 halflives agent whichever short . Subjects LHRH GnRH agonist may maintain agent . 2 . Prior treatment cabozantinib 3 . Radiation therapy bone brain metastasis within 2 week , external radiation therapy within 4 week first dose study drug . Systemic treatment radionuclides within 4weeks . Subjects clinically relevant ongoing complication prior radiation therapy eligible . 4 . The subject recover baseline CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 toxicity due prior therapy except alopecia nonclinically significant AEs . 5 . Known uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastasis cranial epidural disease ; subject previously treat stable dose corticosteroid and/or anticonvulsant &gt; 10 day , require medication , eligible . Baseline brain scan require confirm eligibility . Radiation therapy bone brain metastasis within 2 week first dose study drug ; external radiation therapy systemic treatment radionuclides within 4 week first dose study drug . Subjects clinically relevant ongoing complication prior radiation therapy eligible 6 . The subject require concomitant treatment , therapeutic dos , anticoagulant warfarin warfarinrelated agent , heparin , thrombin Factor Xa inhibitor , antiplatelet agent ( eg , clopidogrel ) . Low dose aspirin ( ≤ 100 mg/day ) , lowdose warfarin ( ≤ 1 mg/day ) , prophylactic low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) permit . 7 . The subject experience follow within 3 month first dose study treatment : clinicallysignificant hematemesis gastrointestinal bleeding Clinicallysignificant hemoptysis ≥ 0.5 teaspoon ( 2.5ml ) red blood c. sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage 8 . The subject radiographic evidence cavitating pulmonary lesion ( ) 9 . The subject tumor contact invade major blood vessel 10 . The subject evidence endotracheal endobronchial tumor within 28 day first dose cabozantinib . 11 . The subject uncontrolled , significant intercurrent recent illness include , limited , following condition : Cardiovascular disorder include Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III ( moderate ) Class IV ( severe ) time screen Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension define sustain BP ≥ 150 mm Hg systolic , ≥ 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment ( Note : If BP measurement perform within screen period &lt; 150 mm Hg systolic &lt; 90 mm Hg diastolic , BP meet definition sustain . ) Any congenital history long QT syndrome . Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : unstable angina pectoris clinicallysignificant cardiac arrhythmia stroke ( include TIA , ischemic event ) myocardial infarction thromboembolic event require therapeutic anticoagulation ( Note : subject venous filter ( e.g . vena cava filter ) eligible study ) Gastrointestinal disorder particularly associate high risk perforation fistula formation include : Any follow within 28 day first dose study treatmentF intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade GI mucosa ( malignant abdominal ascites constitute mucosal invasion ) active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis malabsorption syndrome Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : history abdominal fistula gastrointestinal perforation bowel obstruction gastric outlet obstruction intraabdominal abscess . Note : Complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even abscess occur 6 month ago . GI surgery ( particularly associate delayed incomplete healing ) within 28 day . Note : Complete heal follow abdominal surgery must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even surgery occur 28 day ago . Other disorder associate high risk fistula formation include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy concurrent evidence intraluminal tumor involve trachea esophagus . Other clinically significant disorder : active infection require systemic treatment within 28 day first dose study treatment serious nonhealing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 day first dose study treatment history organ transplant concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism thyroid dysfunction within 7 day first dose study treatment Major surgery ( eg , thoracotomy , removal biopsy brain metastasis ) within 3 month Week 1 Day 1 . Complete wound heal major surgery must occur 1 month Week 1 Day 1 minor surgery ( eg , simple excision , tooth extraction ) least 10 day Week 1 Day 1 . Subjects clinically relevant ongoing complication prior surgery eligible . history major surgery follow : 12 . The subject unable swallow tablet 13 . The subject correct QT interval calculate Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 500 m 14 day Week 1 Day 1 14 . The subject pregnant breastfeeding . 15 . The subject previously identify allergy hypersensitivity component study treatment formulation . 16 . The subject unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator designee . 17 . Uncontrolled concurrent malignancy would limit assessment efficacy cabozantinib .</criteria>
