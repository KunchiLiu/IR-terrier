	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disease , affect one million Americans . The cardinal clinical manifestation PD motoric , limit functional mobility lead difficulty work , care family member , manage household , overall decrease independence quality life ( QOL ) . A wealth grow data indicate tremendous benefit exercise patient PD . Not exercise program show improve motor function reduce risk fall , also improve overall QOL possibly course disease pathology . However , program involve supervision home people PD expensive roll widely , program involve people PD travel central site result non-compliance time difficulty get site , also rule involvement large number people PD simply live far large center program typically establish . Objective : The investigator hypothesize one-year in-home exercise program , center around remote , real-time instruction supervision , reduce rate fall improve strength QOL patient PD . Methods : The propose study randomize control trial structured exercise program , evaluate effect fall rate , physical functioning , QOL . Community-dwelling people PD randomize either group receive structured remote exercise instruction supervision real-time group teach lifestyle exercise program . Subjects male female Veterans physician diagnosis idiopathic , typical PD , least 2 3 cardinal sign PD , response dopaminergic medication . The intervention last one year .</detailed_description>
