	<criteria>Inclusion : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic unresectable adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Patients must either intolerant refractory one standard line ( ) chemotherapy treatment prior enrollment . Toxicity prior regimen must resolve less equal grade 1 prior enrollment . Patients grade 2 neurotoxicity may enrol case case basis discretion principle investigator . Patients treatment least 4 week prior trial enrollment . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use gemcitabine combination docetaxel patient &lt; 18 year age colorectal adenocarcinoma , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function . Additional eligibility criterion : Microsatellite instability phenotype archival tissue biopsy determine treat institution PCR IHC assay Methylation CHFR gene promoter archival tissue biopsy As gemcitabine docetaxel know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion treatment . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition gemcitabine docetaxel . Patients receive medication substance inhibitor inducer CYP 3A4 ineligible . Lists include medication substance know potential interact cytochrome 450 3A4 isoenzyme provide appendix C. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect study medication . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gemcitabine docetaxel breastfeed discontinue mother treat . These potential risk may also apply agent use study include supportive medication . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction gemcitabine docetaxel . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
