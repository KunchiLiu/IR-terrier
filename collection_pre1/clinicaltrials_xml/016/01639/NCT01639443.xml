	<brief_title>Reducing VA No-Shows : Evaluation Predictive Overbooking Applied Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient `` no-shows '' especially common VA gastrointestinal ( GI ) endoscopy unit , open-access endoscopy schedule patient dislike procedure contribute high absenteeism . In proposal , investigator use endoscopy case example evaluate predictive overbooking model derive use patient-level predictor absenteeism . The no-show overbooking intervention employ logistic regression model use patient data predict odds no-showing 80 % accuracy . These project no-show appointment overbooked clerk patient agree join `` fast track '' short-call line . However , patient schedule upper endoscopy `` fast track '' assume small risk service denial day overbooking case inaccurate prediction . If occurs , patient guarantee service next available position assure short wait time . Patients scheduled colonoscopy never turn may experience delay wait room day `` fast track '' appointment . By rapidly process endoscopy patient move traditional slot , investigator predict schedule slot would become available patient await colonoscopy . Investigators propose conduct prospective , 24-month , interrupted time series ( ITS ) trial WLAVA ( West Los Angeles Veterans Administration ) GI clinic endoscopy unit . During intervention period , investigator activate no-show predictive overbooking strategy describe . Investigators compare outcomes schedule strategy , include difference percent utilization capacity ( primary outcome ) , number Veterans serve , mean patient lag time schedule procedure , number unexpected service denial ( `` bump '' ) no-show predictive overbooking , direct cost care . Investigators analyze difference use traditional univariate multivariate approach , use autoregressive integrate moving average ( ARIMA ) analyse adjust auto-correlations ITS data .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients schedule upper endoscopy agree term `` fast track '' offer . If patient express concern service denial , confusion bargain , refuse participate , investigator schedule patient routinely .</criteria>
