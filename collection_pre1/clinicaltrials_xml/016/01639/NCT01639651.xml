	<brief_summary>For many year researcher document shoulder throw athlete acquires increase external rotation dominant limb compare contralateral side.This fact follow loss internal rotation shoulder , relate high rate injury joint it´s know Glenohumeral Internal Rotation Deficit ( GIRD ) . Among approaches condition literature inconclusive due low methodological quality clinical trial make , however , manual therapy use success relief pain restore range motion . The purpose study analyse effectiveness mobilization movement technique improve internal rotation shoulder throw athlete GIRD . It randomize control trial CONSORT base 40 participant divide two group : - Control group submit evaluation shoulder range motion ( internal/external rotation ) limb , upper limb active movement warm-up ( five minute ) , posterior capsule stretch ( Cross-body stretch 3 set 30 second ) revaluation immediately post-intervention four week post-intervention . - Mobilization group submit evaluation shoulder range motion ( internal/external rotation ) limb , upper limb active movement warm-up ( five minute ) , posterior capsule stretch ( Cross-body stretch 3 set 30 second ) plus mobilization movement technique improve internal rotation dominant shoulder ( three set 10 repetition ) revaluation immediately post-intervention four week post-intervention . To evaluate range movement use standard goniometer attach customize bubble inclinometer ensure proper perpendicular alignment goniometer ground . The investigator hypothesis group improvement internal rotation dominant shoulder , however , mobilization group statistically significant difference compare control group immediately post-intervention . Four week post-intervention difference equalize , intervention apply . Results express hazard ratio ( HR ) respective confidence interval 95 % adopt α = 0.05 . All analyze perform SPSS version 17.0</brief_summary>
