	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) considerably improve survival HIV-infected patient . Opportunist diseases cancer link immunodepression largely regress . Challenge management cardio-vascular disease , nephrologic , neurologic , osteo-articular disease , chronic hepatitis cancer link immunodepression . All comorbidities report HIV-infected patient general non-HIV infected patient . Those directly link effect chronic HIV-infection ageing , metabolic effect HAART , way life characterise population . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) result tobacco consumption . Bronchial chronic infection , immunity , age also involve physiopathology COPD . This disease never evaluate large prospective cohort HIV-infected patient whereas known increase tobacco consumption pulmonary infection population regardless general population . Characterisation COPD disease HIV patient allow u make hypothetic epidemiological link HIV- HAART COPD independently tobacco consumption , study different physiopathologic hypothesis evocated COPD genesis , like accelerate pulmonary ageing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management HIV mainly represent commorbidities ( cardio-vascular disease , nephrologic , neurologic , osteo-articular disease , chronic hepatitis cancer link immunodepression ) . COPD prevalence never study HIV population . In consequence , guideline screening , treatment follow-up COPD HIV patient . However population seem particularly risk develop COPD high tobacco consumption accelerate ageing . Thus , need epidemiologic study understand prevalence COPD HIV population order organize specific screen follow-up . This support improvement COPD early manage . On top , COPD screen increase awareness HIV patient problematic tobacco consumption .</detailed_description>
