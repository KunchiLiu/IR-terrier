	<detailed_description>Cannabis use disorder ( CUD ) , ten time common patient schizophrenia ( SCZ ) general population , worsen course severe psychiatric disorder . Since SCZ occur 1 % population , co-occurrence CUD 13 % 42 % people disorder present society important public health problem . Unfortunately , antipsychotic available treatment patient SCZ appear limit cannabis use . Moreover , one antipsychotic preliminary data suggest may well limit cannabis use patient , clozapine ( CLOZ ) , use purpose ; reserve patient whose psychosis treatment resistant . The overarch idea behind proposal , however , CLOZ 's use unreasonably restrict make widely available patient SCZ co-occurring CUD whose psychosis necessarily treatment resistant . This notion support preliminary clinical animal data effect CLOZ , well neurobiological model basis cannabis use patient SCZ provide pharmacologic rationale effect CLOZ . Even give argument favor potential benefit CLOZ patient SCZ CUD , however , side effect profile likely limit use fully power study demonstrate ability decrease cannabis use patient SCZ . This proposal aim launch study . If , hypothesize , study confirms extend previous preliminary data effect CLOZ patient SCZ CUD , provide strong impetus expand use CLOZ population . In proposed study , 132 patient comorbid SCZ CUD randomize 12-week treatment course either CLOZ risperidone ( RISP ) test hypothesis patient treat CLOZ decrease cannabis use compare patient treat RISP . In addition , study determine whether patient treat CLOZ improvement psychiatric symptom , quality life neuropsychological function compare take RISP . We also explore whether patient take CLOZ show improve reward responsiveness compare take RISP . Finally , study explore whether patient val/val genotype COMT Val158Met locus likely decrease cannabis use CLOZ treatment without val/val COMT genotype . Should study indicate CLOZ lessen cannabis use patient SCZ RISP , provide evidence need begin shift clinical practice toward use patient .</detailed_description>
