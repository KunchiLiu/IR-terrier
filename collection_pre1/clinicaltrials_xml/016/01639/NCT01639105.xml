	<brief_summary>Rationale The cosmetic aspect scar frequent reason consultation . It play important role patient satisfaction self-image . Several treatment modality propose scar variable success . Ablative fractional laser treatment rather new concept . Many microscopic small laser beam target dermis grid pattern . The vertical column skin hit laser beam heat . This thermal effect stimulate wound heal potentially lead remodel skin structure . Ablative fractional laser treatment use successfully treatment pigment change , wrinkle , acne scar thermal burn wound . It report CO2 ablative fractional laser treatment positive clinical effect various type scar however proven yet prospective randomize trial . The low morbidity treatment lack convincing adapt treatment modality various type scar make treatment attractive . That 's investigator aim randomize study evaluate clinical effect safety 10 600 nm ablative fractional laser therapy patient recent scar due surgical intervention . Goal Evaluate efficacy three 10 600 nm ablative fractional laser treatment mention scar , three month last laser treatment , prospective randomize intra-patient control study . Study design Prospective single blind randomized intra-patient control study . The study comprise 4 study visit . Study population The population consist one group patient scar recent surgical operation . The patient must meet inclusion exclusion criterion describe protocol . Method The scar divide two equal half . The two half randomize . One part treat . The part undergo three time 10 600 nm ablative laser therapy 4 week interval treatment . The efficacy treatment evaluate three month last treatment objective subjective parameter . Most important study endpoint : - Evaluation efficacy treatment . A blinded clinical scar evaluation do treat untreated part POSAS scar scale , study collaborator patient , category scale 0 10 ( 0 = normal skin , 10 = bad scar imaginable ) , start twelve week last treatment . - Evaluation pain related treatment . The pain score patient VAS category scale 0 10 ( 0 = pain , 10 = worst pain ever ) . - Evaluation side effect treatment . A standardized form use . - Evaluation global patient satisfaction regard treatment . - Clinical photo , start twelve week last treatment .</brief_summary>
