	<brief_summary>Reducing length labor highly desirable goal intrapartum care , perspective maternal fetal well-being , provider birth service . Avoiding along , protract labor entail short exposure pain , anxiety stress would thus translate major improvement maternal satisfaction childbirth experience . Based premise shorten length labor beneficial , intervention aim accelerate progression labor introduce routinely part standard labor management care throughout 20th century . Certain labor accelerative procedure , amniotomy , become common practice put acid test randomize control trial evaluate efficacy . Use anticholinergics/antispasmodics method augment labor ﬁrst described 1937 Hirsch , report decrease labor length two four hour follow Intrapartum administration atropine-like drug ( Syntropan® ) mainly among old nullipara . Drotaverine , isoquinolone derivative superior smooth muscle relaxant act specifically spastic site corrects cAMP calcium balance relieve smooth muscle spasm . This inhibitory action detect low uterine segment labor since muscle fiber upper uterine segment strongly affect contractile effect oxytocin . Use drotaverine pregnancy free teratogenic embryotoxic effect .

	<detailed_description>Research question : Does use antispasmodic Drotaverine shorten duration active first stage labor nulliparous woman compare placebo ? Research hypothesis : population mean Drotaverine placebo group equal regard duration first stage labor . Objectives : The purpose study determine effectiveness Drotaverine reduce duration labor context contemporary practice , among nulliparous woman manage accord standard intrapartum protocol . Study setting : Patients recruit woman admit labor delivery unit Ain Shams Maternity Hospital . Study design : This study phase II III , intervention study- Randomized Controlled double blind study . Procedure : Every patient subject : 1 . Complete history exclude allergy Drotaverine Hydrochloride contraindication normal vaginal delivery . 2 . General examination patient include ( pulse , blood pressure , temperature ) . 3 . Obstetric Abdominal examination include lie , presentation , station ; fetal heart rate , uterine contraction , amount liquor exclude multiple pregnancy . 4 . Vaginal examination aseptic condition assess cervical dilation , effacement , state fetal membrane , present part , position fetal head , color liquor pelvic adequacy . 5 . Assessment frequency , duration uterine contraction monitor fetal wellbeing applied CTG application admission : - CTG apply half hour participant start intervention . 1 . If contraction adequate : - Patients intact membrane → AROM do , reassessment one hour . If still adequate contraction , Oxytocin infusion start ( five I.U . Oxytocin 500 cc ringer I.V . drip ) titration method complete regulation uterine contraction . - Those ruptured membrane , amniotic fluid color check abnormality Oxytocin infusion start ( five I.U . Oxytocin 500 cc ringer I.V . drip ) titration method complete regulation uterine contraction . 2 . If contraction adequate : No interference do . 6 . Each participant randomly take prefilled syringe two milliliter study medication solution ( either Drotaverine Hydrochloride saline ) . Each participant take select syringe slowly intravenously two minute . 7 . Partographic representation labor duration first stage determine primary end point study `` duration 1st stage '' . 8 . Cervical effacement dilatation addition station position fetal head record every two hour vaginal examination . 9 . Reassessment four hour first dose : A ) If poor progress : Initially , exclude C.P.D . &amp; uterine inertia . - If obvious cause : - C.P.D . : Urgent C-section do . - Uterine inertia : adjust dose Oxytocin I.V drip via titration method complete regulation uterine contraction . - If obvious cause : - Another dose colorless solution give reassessment four hour , If progress → evaluation final decision mode delivery . B ) If good progress : No interference do . Outcome : 1 . Primary outcome : 1 . The duration active first stage labor ( Partographic representation cervical effacement dilatation plot participant ) . 2 . Rate cervical dilation ( cm/h ) . 2 . Secondary outcome : 1 . Effect pain use visual analogue scale one hour injection solution . VAS do 30 , 60 120 minute drug administration . 2 . Mode delivery . 3 . APGAR score less 7 1 5 minute . 4 . Maternal drug side effect record . Randomization Blinding : Randomization achieve use computer-generated randomization sequence . Allocation 1:1 ratio . Records group allocation maintain resident physician `` researcher '' whose responsibility randomization draw injection dark seal syrinx black opaque sticker make yellowish color Drotaverine Hydrochloride ( Do-Spa® ) in-differentiable translucent saline solution . This house officer direct involvement intrapartum decision making . Drotaverine Hydrochloride saline injection identical appearance . The midwife , clinician staff labor delivery patient could distinguish placebo active drug . The randomization list hold secure box labor ward ensure concealment allocation intervention recruit participant . Data Collection : Maternal characteristic labor information prospectively collect computerized database maintain daily chart review researcher ensure accuracy minimize miss data The primary end-point study duration first stage labor.The first stage encompass onset active labor complete cervical dilatation . However , woman randomize different dilatation level , allow meaningful comparison dilatation rate ( administration study drug full dilatation ) calculate used primary outcome measure . Analysis : Data analysis reporting strictly follow recommendation CONSORT 2010 For primary secondary outcome , result group , estimate effect size precision ( 95 % confidence interval ) . For binary outcome , presentation absolute risk difference relative ( Risk Ratio ) effect size report . Ethical consideration IRB approval : The clinical research study conduct accordance current IRB-approved clinical protocol ; ICH GCP Guidelines ; relevant policy , requirement , regulation Ain Shams University . Consent procedure : The investigator make certain appropriate inform consent process place ensure potential research subject , authorize representative , fully inform nature objectives clinical study , potential risk benefit study participation , right research subject . The investigator obtain write , sign informed consent subject , subject 's authorized representative , prior perform study-specific procedure subject . The investigator retain original sign informed consent form . Subject confidentiality : All laboratory specimen , evaluation form , report , video recording record leave site include unique personal data maintain subject confidentiality . Funding : Internal funding use Hospital resource .</detailed_description>
