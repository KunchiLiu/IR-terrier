	<detailed_description>The usual ablation catheter provide direct information pressure apply contact area cardiac structure . However , pressure show play important role determine size potential efficacy ablation lesion . The physical contact tip catheter tissue force exert tissue indirectly estimate parameter signal voltage , transmit force end catheter felt operator , less extent , circuit impedance . A widespread technique ablation ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) patient cardiomyopathy ischemic disease consist creation electroanatomic map delineate scar area without electric activity look area survive myocardium inside , border scar , operate slow conduction channel reentry circuit play essential role genesis VTs . The distinction scar normal tissue predominantly base voltage unipolar bipolar electrograms ( EGM ) record tip ablation catheter . However , amplitude electrogram depends critically distance electrode source electric field , case myocardial tissue . The lack contact catheter endocardium reduce EGM voltage may induce interpret normal EGM point low-voltage point , lead erroneous delineation real scar area eventually miss electrically active myocardial path . Thus good physical contact catheter tissue prerequisite obtain reliable voltage map correctly identify scar area potentially involved VT maintenance . A direct information force apply tip catheter may avoid interpretation area no-contact induced low-voltage scar . Hypothesis . The hypothesis study information force exert catheter tip obtain SmartTouch technology may improve assessment scar area electroanatomical mapping patient VT due ischemic disease cardiomyopathy . Study objectives endpoint . Two main objective study : 1 . To compare area scar ( define low-voltage threshold ) obtain conventional voltage map obtain contact map information available operator . 2 . To determine availability contact information operator allow improvement electroanatomic map correct point take no-contact area . Study protocol . 1 . Inclusion criterion . Consecutive patient ventricular arrhythmia due ischemic heart disease dilate cardiomyopathy undergoing VT ablation include study . Exclusion criterion age &lt; 18 year , absence sign informed consent critical clinical status precludes detail mapping procedure . 2 . Study design duration . The study plan prospective , one-center , non-randomized study . As objective purely descriptive formal calculation sample size perform . Considering inclusion criterion frequency type study unit number 20 30 patient estimate include 12 month . We believe number patient reasonable estimate value contact map delineate scar clinical point view . 3 . Protocol procedure . Our standard approach ischemic VT ablation begin acquisition voltage map leave ventricle sinus rhythm fix pace right ventricular apex use CARTO-3 navigation system Navistar irrigate catheter . During acquisition , point fragment delayed potential tag area potential interest ablation . Once map complete adjust color code voltage map try decide area dense scar look potential narrow path inside area scar . After adjust map way proceed ablation , perform induced VT guide anatomical electrical information case non-inducible non-tolerated VTs . Pace-mapping eventually use 12-lead ECG clinical VT available . For patient include study voltage map acquire way use Thermo-Cool Smart Touch catheter . The force information record system available operator map acquisition . The complete voltage map area define dense scar operator , isthmuses find inside scar area fragment delayed potential save control map . Following step contact map available operator compare control map map point acquisition allow correct area previously acquire poor contact . The final map correction make save corrected map . The ablation procedure perform usual . 4 . Map analysis The comparison map do deferred way . First , control map contact map compare . The area without contact pressure map estimate . Each point inside area classify dense scar , low-voltage point normal voltage point accord property point control map . We determine way classified area without contact pressure information available , many non-contact point falsely assume dense scar . The area `` real '' dense scar `` assume , non-contact '' dense scar estimate well . This step analysis give information many low-voltage area standard electroanatomic map may reliable due lack appropriate contact . The control correct map compare . The area number point define dense scar operator map compare point change status scar , low normal voltage control correct map annotate well . Finally , difference potential isthmus depict map analyze . These comparison give information much standard electroanatomic map improve force information add . 5 . Patient consent . The study present ethic committee centre approval . A write , informed consent require sign patient entering study . 6 . Time schedule The recruitment patient start soon project approve Biosense Webster local ethic committee . The inclusion period would 12 month . Data analysis perform study period , make final result available shortly end study . An additional 6 month period expect report publish result international cardiology journal . 7 . Privacy policy All patient 's data remain hospital file transmit external subject . A code assign patient order allow analysis data anonymous way .</detailed_description>
