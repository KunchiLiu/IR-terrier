	<brief_summary>POEMS syndrome rare form B cell dyscrasia combine proliferation usually plasma cell , polyneuropathy , osteocondensing bone lesion multiple clinical sign . Lenalidomide appear particularly efficient pathology . The investigator propose phase II multicentre protocol , base use lenalidomide combine dexamethasone patient present POEMS syndrome , either de novo resistant relapse . Patients treat local radiation intensive treatment stem cell support undergo 2 cycle lenalidomide-dexamethasone ( Len-Dex ) combination radiation intensive treatment ( Group 1 ) , patient undergo 9 cycle Len-Dex combination ( Group 2 ) . A biological study couple clinical protocol order define best biological marker predict clinical response , good understand POEMS pathophysiological mechanism set bank sample use study rare pathology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose simultaneously set two Phase II therapeutic trial : Trial `` 2 cycle '' trial `` 9 cycle '' ( Fleming plan one stage ) . This mean prospective multicentre study , around treatment lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination patient suffer POEMS syndrome either de novo , resistant relapse . Both trial carry parallel complementary regard eligibility criterion : - Group 1 : `` 2-cycles '' trial available patient treat radiation intensive treatment ( 75 % case occur front line ) ; undergo 2 cycle lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination radiation intensive treatment ( Group 1 ) . - Group 2 : `` 9-cycles '' trial available front-line patient ( 25 % front-line patient ) patient relapse resistant , undergo 9 cycle lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination follow maintenance therapy lenalidomide alone one year ( Group 2 ) . Both trial carry within study enable u answer question potential efficacy lenalidomide POEMS syndrome could enable u draw new therapeutic standard . Main objective : Group 1 : evaluate efficacy Len-Dex combination biological response 2 cycle patient POEMS syndrome undergo radiation intensive treatment . Group 2 : evaluate efficacy Len-Dex combination biological response patient POEMS syndrome treat radiation intensive treatment .</detailed_description>
