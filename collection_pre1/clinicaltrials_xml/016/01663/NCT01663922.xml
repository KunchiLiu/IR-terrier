	<brief_summary>The purpose study look whether take new medication hepatitis C ( boceprevir ) together herbal remedy commonly use treatment depression ( SJW ) effect level boceprevir blood , compare boceprevir take . Treatment hepatitis C genotype-1 , recently significantly improve addition new class drug call protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . Boceprevir belong class antiviral drug administer combination drug treat hepatitis C. One common side effect treatment hepatitis C low mood ( depression ) treat patient may self-medicate preparation contain St. Johns Wort ( SJW ) . SJW known cause drug interaction , take SJW time boceprevir may result change drug usually work . It therefore important find level boceprevir blood significantly affect take SJW . The study aim help u understand whether safe take SJW whilst simultaneously treat hepatitis C boceprevir .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boceprevir Ucalm ( St John &amp; Apos ; Wort )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Boceprevir strong inhibitor CYP3A4/5 . Medicines metabolize primarily CYP3A4/5 may increase exposure administer boceprevir , could increase prolong therapeutic adverse reaction . Boceprevir inhibit induce enzymes CYP450 family . Boceprevir show P-glycoprotein breast cancer resistant protein ( BCRP ) substrate vitro . There potential inhibitor inducer transporter alter concentration boceprevir ; clinical implication interaction known.Boceprevir partly metabolize CYP3A4/5 . Co-administration boceprevir medicine induce inhibit CYP3A4/5 could increase decrease exposure boceprevir affect efficacy.Boceprevir , combination peginterferon ribavirin , contraindicate coadministered medicine highly dependent CYP3A4/5 clearance , elevate plasma concentration associate serious and/or life-threatening event . Examples may include ; orally administer midazolam triazolam , bepridil , pimozide , lumefantrine , halofantrine , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , ergot derivative ( dihydroergotamine , ergonovine , ergotamine , methylergonovine ) . Boceprevir primarily metabolize aldoketo reductase ( AKR ) . In medicine interaction trial conduct AKR inhibitor diflunisal ibuprofen , boceprevir exposure increase clinically significant extent . Boceprevir may co-administered AKR inhibitor . The concomitant use boceprevir stong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin anticonvulsant ( phenytoin , phenobarbital carbamazepine ) may significantly reduce plasma exposure boceprevir . As data available , combination boceprevir medicine recommend . The metabolism St John 's Wort currently know . Treatment St John 's wort 14 day result significant increase urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol/ cortisol ratio , suggest St John 's wort inducer CYP3A4 . For reason , recommend administer SJW CYP3A4 metabolize drug . Furthermore , interaction may occur P-glycoprotein substrate , St. John 's wort induce activity transmembrane transporter . This might decrease effectiveness medication . For reason illustrate , potential drug interaction SJW boceprevir high co-administration must study order gain information whether : ) SJW lead decrease boceprevir concentration therefore efficacy ; ii ) boceprevir lead increase SJW ( hypericin ) exposure risk toxicity . The safety PK combination know especially view common side effect cause interferon , co-administered boceprevir treatment hepatitis C : interferon cause depression , patient may choose take SJW rather prescribe anti-depressants manage mood change antihepatitis treatment .</detailed_description>
