	<brief_summary>Arterial catheterization frequently perform critically ill patient invasive blood pressure monitor and/or frequent blood draw , especially arterial blood gas analysis . The distal part radial artery ( wrist ) prefer access site . The potential complication procedure mostly minor comprise temporary occlusion radial artery ( RA ) , hematoma , local infection bleed puncture site . Major complication include vessel aneurysm occlusion threat hand viability rare . The standard approach catheterization `` blind '' puncture RA locate pulse palpation , follow thread 20 Gauge ( 20G ) angio-catheter vessel . Alternatively ultrasound use locate vessel guide needle insertion . To knowledge , four prospective randomize trial ( PRT ) 5-8 compare palpation ultrasound-guided RA catheterization conduct far one meta-analysis look pool data obtain . The result show ultrasound guidance increase first-attempt success rate RA catheterization 71 % compare palpation . The use ultrasound also significantly reduce time successful catheterization , number puncture well amount catheter require per procedure . None prior randomize trial conduct ICU set three four study arterial line place patient undergo elective surgery . The investigator hypothesize ultrasound could improve first attempt success rate place arterial catheter ICU set . Ultrasound may also reduce total time successful insertion reduce complication . The investigator plan randomize patient either palpation technique ultrasound guide catheter insertion record outcomes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct prospective randomize design patient population Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) Yale New Haven Hospital . All SICU patient indication arterial catheterization establish attend physician eligible consent randomization either `` Palpation '' `` Ultrasound '' group . Once consent patient his/her surrogate obtain , eligible patient randomize either `` Palpation '' `` Ultrasound '' group . Sequentially numbered seal envelope maintain SICU . Catheter insertion : The side insertion ( left/right arm ) chosen operator . The wrist position operator , skin disinfect area drape sterile fashion . `` Palpation '' group '' : The artery puncture location palpation . `` Ultrasound '' group '' : The artery puncture real-time ultrasound probe drape sterile sheath . The time first skin puncture confirm intra-arterial position catheter observe blood return catheter measure chronometer second person . An arterial pressure waveform must observe monitor validate intra-arterial catheter placement . Radial artery cannulation perform use `` Radial Artery Catheterization Set Integral Needle Protection '' ( Ref . RA-04020-SP , Arrows International Inc. , Reading PA 19605 , USA ) contain 20G catheter 22 gauge ( 22G ) puncture needle 0.46 mm spring-wire guide . For ultrasound-guided catheter insertion , operator use `` Site-Rite 6 Ultrasound System '' linear vascular access probe ( 5-10 MHz ) ( Bard Access Systems Inc. , 605 North 5600 West , Salt Lake City , UT 84116 , USA ) . Operators : RA catheterization typical teaching procedure frequently perform ICU . In unit , arterial line place either post graduate year 2 ( PGY-2 ) resident ( surgery &amp; anesthesia ) rotate SICU monthly basis , mid-level provider unit indeterminate period time . For study , important point , one goal demonstrate learn effect , less likely observable among PGY-2 resident present unit month . All operator get instruction ( lecture hands-on training vascular phantom begin SICU rotation ) use ultrasound vascular access time opportunity exercise skill vessel phantom . Each successful vessel puncture vessel phantom must record operator , include time date . For operator perform ultrasound-guided insertion patient , one investigator present supervision data collection , assistance insertion , unless require failure use method . Cross-over : After three fail attempt catheterization allocate first method , alternative method must use ; operator opt puncture RA opposite arm . Timing first method end operator decides abandon third attempt . Timing new method start new first skin puncture . Follow : All catheter monitor daily day 1 3 clinical ultrasound examination development complication . The catheter follow daily functional outcome define quality arterial waveform monitor ability draw blood catheter . The day catheter cease function purpose record well day catheter removal .</detailed_description>
