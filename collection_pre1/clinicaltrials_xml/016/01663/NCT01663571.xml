	<brief_summary>Protocol Summary Constitutive STAT3 activity implicate many malignancy include Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma . It also essential Th17 differentiation , subset CD4 effector T cell , implicate chronic inflammatory condition possibly CTCL . HDAC inhibitor show activity CTCL exact mechanism action know . It known HDAC inhibitor regulate STAT3 transcriptional activity hence potentially active CTCL modulation STAT3 pathway . The hypothesis Th17 cytokine contribute initiation cancer create pro-inflammatory microenvironment predisposes cell neoplastic transformation . To probe , investigator compare difference cytokine production gene expression skin resident T cell patient benign dermatosis CTCL well blood/circulating lymphocyte healthy donor Sezary syndrome ( SS ) . The investigator also investigate whether HDAC inhibitor direct impact number Th17 cell , cytokine production cell phosphorylated STAT3 protein CTCL subsequent treatment cycle . The objective study 1 . Observe epigenetic , transcriptional phenotypic change take place T cell malignant transformation 2 . Understand mechanism action HDAC inhibitor CTCL . Methods : Skin biopsy specimens cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) patient benign skin condition namely eczema , dermatitis psoriasis obtain standard punch biopsy procedure skin lesion . Additionally , 15 ml peripheral blood CTCL patient Sezary syndrome ( SS ) patient benign skin condition collect . CTCL patient , start treatment HDAC Inhibitors namely Vorinostat Romidepsin , total 3 skin biopsy and/or blood draw . The first procedure would start treatment either HDAC inhibitor . Two skin biopsy and/or blood draw perform first second cycle treatment . Levels Th17 cytokine , IL-17 , IL -22 pSTAT3 protein determine IHC stain skin cytokine level blood assay sandwich ELISA method.The investigator also assay mRNA level transcription factor different T effector cell qPCR .</brief_summary>
