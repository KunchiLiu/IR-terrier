	<brief_summary>Taking account excellent prognosis patient HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer &lt; 10 pack-year smoking , investigator hypothesize reduce intensity therapy patient reduce treatment sequela , notably long-term dysphagia , without affect cure rate . The main Aim ass whether reduce treatment intensity , replace concurrent chemotherapy cetuximab , indeed achieve improve long-term toxicity . The primary objective include follow : confirm reduce treatment intensity patient HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer &lt; 10 pack-year smoke history replace concurrent chemotherapy concurrent cetuximab , significantly increase proportion patient whose tumor recur , compare previous experience similar patient receive chemo-RT compare toxicity patient receive cetuximab-RT similar patient treat 7 week chemotherapy concurrent RT ( `` standard therapy '' ) UMCC 2-21 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced-intensity Therapy Oropharyngeal Cancer Non-smoking HPV-16 Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator show past experience high success get rid oropharyngeal cancer ( tonsil base tongue cancer ) use chemotherapy radiation therapy patient smoke , smoke minimal amount cigarette equivalent . In patient , cancer think cause virus ( Human Papilloma Virus , HPV ) . HPV virus infects epidermis ( outermost layer skin ) mucous membrane human . In general , patient HPV-related cancer well prognosis compare patient whose tumor smoking-related . Taking account good prognosis , possible reduce intensity therapy affect high rate tumor control , reduce side-effects therapy . In study , investigator plan reduce intensity treatment replace currently use chemotherapy drug FDA approve drug , cetuximab , monoclonal antibody growth factor help cancer cell grow . By oppose effect growth factor , cetuximab may help radiotherapy kill cancer cell without lot effect normal tissue . It differ chemotherapy selective activity tumor compare normal tissue Cetuximab chance preserve high rate success kill tumor may reduce side effect complication therapy comparison chemotherapy drug . The investigator would also like know take cetuximab effect certain cancer-related molecule cancer normal cell inside cheek . They would like test take small biopsy tumor , well swab inside cheek , shortly start therapy .</detailed_description>
