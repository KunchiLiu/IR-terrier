	<brief_summary>Background : - The brain protect barrier keep toxin blood reach brain . However , barrier also keep useful medication reach brain . P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) brain protein part blood-brain barrier . The level P-gp high people epilepsy people without epilepsy . These different level P-gp may explain people seizures respond well medication . Researchers want see P-gp affect response epilepsy medication . - Epilepsy may also associate brain inflammation . Researchers also want look part brain affect epilepsy see inflammation present . Objectives : - To see P-gp affect response epilepsy medication . - To see inflammation present part brain affect epilepsy . Eligibility : - &lt; TAB &gt; Individuals 18 60 year age temporal lobe epilepsy . We plan study patient whose seizure well control drug , whose seizure control . - &lt; TAB &gt; - Healthy volunteer 18 60 year age . Design : - This study require four five visit NIH Clinical Center course year . The visit outpatient visit last 2 5 hour . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - All participant two positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . The scan take place different visit . Different drug use scan . One drug use temporarily block effect P-gp brain . The drug show area inflammation brain . - Participants epilepsy third PET scan . This scan also look P-gp activity brain . However , use drug block effect P-gp . - All participant also one magnetic resonance imaging scan . This scan help show brain function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To study role inflammation focal epilepsy 2 . To characterize BBB state patient focal epilepsy use MRI , compare result PET image inflammation 3 . To study test-retest replicability [ 11C ] PBR28 PET scan . Study population : 50 participant drug-resistant focal epilepsy , 25 participant drug-responsive focal epilepsy 25 healthy volunteer . Design : Screening enrol participant include medical history , physical exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood urine laboratory test . Blood sample also use genetic polymorphism study . Healthy volunteer receive one two brain positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan [ 11C ] PBR28 . Epilepsy participant receive one two PET scan [ 11C ] PBR28 ) . Everyone receive brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Some participant also second MRI gadolinium infusion measure blood-brain barrier permeability . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure amount differential [ 11C ] PBR28 uptake epileptic focus homologous contralateral region . [ 11C ] PBR28 distribution volume ( VT ) measure use arterial input function . We want quantify tracer VT region brain distant epileptic focus , may affect disease . We hypothesize focal epilepsy associate brain inflammation , therefore , [ 11C ] PBR28 uptake affect side brain high contralateral side . We study polymorphism translocator protein ( TSPO ) , TSPO polymorphism influence [ 11C ] PBR28 binding . This polymorphism due non-conservative amino-acid substitution position 147 alanine threonine ( Ala147Thr ) fifth transmembrane domain TSPO protein .</detailed_description>

This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic protocol 01N0139 , necessary , inpatient videoEEG monitoring . Seizure focus localization determine standard clinical , neurophysiologic , image study . Drugresponsive participant define clinically document partial seizure consistent EEG evidence define 2010 Revised terminology concept organization seizures epilepsy , seizurefree standard antiepileptic treatment least three month prior enrol study . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section outpatient clinic protocol 01N0139 , necessary , inpatient videoEEG monitoring . Seizure focus localization determine standard clinical , neurophysiologic , image study . No prior diagnosis drug alcohol abuse dependence . For healthy volunteer Age 1860 . Able give write informed consent . No prior diagnosis drug alcohol abuse dependence . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For patient Previous research radiation exposure ( Xrays , PET scan etc . ) , together study procedure , would exceed NIH RSC 5 rad per year research limit .
