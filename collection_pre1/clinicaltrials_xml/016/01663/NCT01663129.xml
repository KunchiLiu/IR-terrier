	<brief_summary>To determine magnitude rate bone mass deficit follow initiation glucocorticoid therapy treatment pediatric leukemia , rheumatic condition nephrotic syndrome , propose 6 year , prospective study 12 academic , tertiary care centre across Canada . The investigator hypothesize glucocorticoid-treated child leukemia , rheumatic condition nephrotic syndrome fail accrue bone mass normal rate , deficits mineral accrual occur glucocorticoid dose- duration-dependent fashion . We also hypothesize fracture incidence increase concomitant reduction bone mass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steroid-Induced Osteoporosis Pediatric Population - Canadian Incidence Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leukemia Bone Morbidity Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) common pediatric malignancy , overall survival rate exceed 70 % . As , increase population survivor risk long-term sequela childhood leukemia , include osteoporosis . In Canada , approximately 250 new case childhood ALL diagnose per year . All child Canada undergo therapy treatment ALL tertiary care pediatric hospital receive high dose glucocorticoid per one three ALL protocol ( Children 's Cancer Group protocol , Pediatric Oncology Group protocol , Dana Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocol ) , depend upon standard care give institution . Musculoskeletal pain gait abnormality report one third child ALL diagnosis , sub-set also demonstrate fracture . Radiographs painful region show metaphyseal lucencies , sclerotic lesion site periosteal reaction many patient bone pain presentation . Lumbar spine areal bone mineral density ( BMD ) reduce diagnosis , total body volumetric BMD within normal range . Several group report significant loss bone mass therapy ALL , study bone mass restitution follow chemotherapy lead inconsistent result . The rapid reduction bone mass occur first 6-8 month therapy , similar observe glucocorticoid effect bone adult . Fractures present many 13 % child diagnosis , rise 39 % chemotherapy . In addition glucocorticoid , number mechanism propose skeletal morbidity ALL , include infiltration bone leukemic cell , paraneoplastic factor , medication , physical inactivity , cranial irradiation , inadequate nutrition disorder mineral metabolism . Rheumatic Conditions Bone Morbidity Rheumatic disease childhood , include juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosis juvenile dermatomyositis , well-known associate compromised skeletal health . Of , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis evaluate extensively . Significant reduction bone mass document number study pediatric patient chronic rheumatic disease , atraumatic fracture note early age . Active arthritis may affect bone metabolism area adjacent affect joint ( `` periarticular osteopenia '' ) , distant site include radius , spine , femoral neck . In recent study pediatric patient reduction bone mass secondary chronic rheumatic disease , 8/38 ( 21 % ) patient fragility fracture , primarily vertebra . Similar osteoporotic condition due chronic illness , pathogenesis bone morbidity case multi-factorial , disease activity , muscle disease , physical inactivity , nutritional status medical therapy playing significant role . However , leukemia , glucocorticoid use emerge one strong determinant skeletal morbidity treatment juvenile rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosis . The role glucocorticoid bone morbidity associate pediatric rheumatic disease juvenile dermatomyositis vasculitides determine . Nephrotic Syndrome Bone Morbidity Childhood nephrotic syndrome idiopathic disorder characterize proteinuria , hypoproteinemia , edema hyperlipidemia . The incidence syndrome vary 1:15,000 1:50,000 . Following introduction glucocorticoid therapy 1970 's , mortality nephrotic syndrome decrease dramatically ensue 15 year , 35 3 per cent . The vast majority patient nephrotic syndrome steroid-responsive disease . In Canada , standard care child first episode nephrotic syndrome high-dose glucocorticoid therapy 6 week , follow gradual taper next three seven month . Only one-third patient enter permanent remission regime , another third require pulse steroid therapy six week ' duration infrequent interval throughout grow year . The final third patient either require frequent course pulse glucocorticoid therapy chronic steroid administration order achieve remission . Children nephrotic syndrome typically well-nourished , fully ambulatory , otherwise well episode . Furthermore , treatment regime likely characterize glucocorticoid therapy alone , compare polytherapy require treatment leukemia rheumatic condition . As , great homogeneity nephrotic syndrome population allow `` pure '' assessment glucocorticoid effect pediatric bone . Small study demonstrate reduction bone mass dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) increase biochemical marker bone resorption among young , glucocorticoid-treated patient nephrotic syndrome . Tenbrock et al . recently show peripheral quantitative compute tomography 16 child nephrotic syndrome , previously treat glucocorticoid , reduction cortical area distal radius , correlate reduction grip strength . The fracture rate among child nephrotic syndrome presently unknown . Among adults nephrotic syndrome , high-dose glucocorticoid administration lead rapid bone loss first month therapy , raise question whether preventive therapy initiate adult three month glucocorticoid use , measure bone mass fall significantly baseline .</detailed_description>
