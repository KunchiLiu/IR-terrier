	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label , multicenter study efficacy safety sequential administration CVP x 6 follow tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab ( formerly refer tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab ) . All patient complete three cycle CVP , regardless response , eligible treatment tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab . Subjects rapidly progressive disease prior complete three cycle CVP may remove study . In order proceed tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab therapy , patient must complete six cycle CVP within 20 week describe . Patients may proceed Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody progressive disease document response evaluation follow 6 cycle CVP . In addition , patient must still meet eligibility inclusion exclusion criterion base upon week 20 assessment , applicable . Patients must also average ≤25 % bone marrow involve NHL receive treatment tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab . The dosimetric dose tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab must give within 28 day response evaluation follow CVP later 56 day first day sixth cycle CVP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase II , open-label , multicenter study efficacy safety sequential administration cycolophosphamide , vacristine , prednisone ( CVP ) x6 cycle follow tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab previously untreated subject low-grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . CVP repeat every 21 day total six cycle . tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab begin within 56 day follow first day sixth cycle CVP . Subjects undergo two dose phase tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab therapy . In first phase , `` dosimetric dose '' , patient receive infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450mg ) 60 minute follow 30 minute infusion ( include 10-minutes flush ) Anti-B1 ( 35mg ) contain 5mCi Iodine-131 . Whole body gamma camera scan obtain Day 0 ; Day 2 , 3 , 4 Day 6 7 follow dosimetric dose . Using dosimetric data three time point , patient-specific dose Iodine-131 calculate deliver desire total body dose radiotherapy . In second phase , term `` therapeutic dose '' , patient receive 60-minute infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody ( 450 mg ) follow 30-minute infusion ( include 10-minute flush ) 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody label subject -specific dose Iodine-131 calculate deliver 75cGy total body radiation dose . Subjects platelet count 100,000-149,999 cells/mm3 receive 65 cGy ; obese patient dose base upon 137 % lean body mass . Subjects treat saturated solution potassium iodide ( SSKI ) , Lugol 's solution , potassium iodide tablet start least 24 hour prior first infusion tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab ( i.e. , dosimetric dose ) continue 14 day follow least infusion tositumomab iodine I 131 tositumomab ( i.e. , therapeutic dose ) .</detailed_description>
