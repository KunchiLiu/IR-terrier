	<brief_summary>The main purpose study look cancer-free survival two year subject high risk upper tract urothelial cancer treat combination two chemotherapy drug call Gemcitabine Cisplatin follow surgery remove kidney , part ureter ( ureter tube make smooth muscle fiber propel urine kidney urinary bladder ) , cuff bladder ureter drain bladder . Other purpose study include look safety Gemcitabine Cisplatin surgery type cancer , time recurrence cancer , overall survival . Exploratory integrative tumor sequencing : The purpose part study test deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) various type sample ( tissue blood ) detect different type cancer genetic change upper tract urothelial cancer ( UTUC ) help develop future study UTUC . DNA RNA contain key instruction cell function help determine characteristic individual hair , eye , skin color , height , susceptibility disease , characteristic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy ( NAC ) In Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma ( UTUC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , combination gemcitabine cisplatin give every 21 day ( gemcitabine day 1 8 ) use trial routine clinical practice . Additionally , surgery , primarily radical nephroureterectomy ( RNU ) bladder cuff removal , current standard treatment invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma . Upper tract urothelial cancer ( UTUC ) urothelial cancer arise pelvicalyceal ureteral location lethal cancer account 5 % urothelial cancer . In urothelial cancer bladder , randomize clinical trial meta-analyses show survival advantage neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy . It conceivable similar approach may benefit patient UTUC . Both Gemcitabine Cisplatin approve FDA . Cisplatin approve use urothelial cancer . Gemcitabine FDA approve use alone drug treat breast , non-small lung , ovarian , pancreatic cancer . Gemcitabine approve FDA urothelial cancer , typically use together Cisplatin trial routine clinical practice treat urothelial cancer . Exploratory integrative tumor sequencing : The biology UTUC poorly understand due relative rarity disease lack comprehensive genomic translational study . This trial offer rare opportunity apply high-throughput sequence technique UTUC detect several class cancer mutation include structural rearrangement , copy number alteration , point mutation , gene expression alteration . This research could help develop future study UTUC help researcher understand UTUC treat . Additionally , may identify potentially important result DNA sample subject could possibly help manage cancer well purse different cancer therapy rather study therapy .</detailed_description>
