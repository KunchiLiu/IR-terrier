	<brief_summary>Approximately 30-60 % schizophrenia patient fail respond typical antipsychotic may respond Clozapine . Clozapine long consider `` gold standard '' within atypical neuroleptic spectrum , back year clinical experience research , uncertainty remain aspect drug . One question link dose , blood level patient clinical response . The Clozapine therapeutic plasma level range 250 - 450 ng/mL create difficulty use result routine clinical practice . Approximately 30 % - 51 % `` treatment-resistant schizophrenia '' patient fully respond Clozapine , poorly understood phenomenon . Factors relevant Clozapine-resistance include co-morbidity , drug misuse , poor adherence , inadequate duration treatment inadequate dose/plasma-levels . Pharmacogenetic factor different polymorphism involve gene may play role . Pharmacodynamic genetic data appear important determine clinical response Clozapine . Clozapine-treated patient possess different 3A4 polymorphism , may respond differently compare patient normal 3A4 allele . Recently , CYP2D6 also involve drug metabolic pathway . Population pharmacokinetics clozapine evaluate nonparametric maximum likelihood method . This pharmacogenetic explanation/hypothesis may explain Clozapine- resistance schizophrenic . The high variability plasma level require large study order able determine correlation clinical efficacy plasma level genotyping . A preliminary study enable power analysis adequate determination sample size .</brief_summary>
