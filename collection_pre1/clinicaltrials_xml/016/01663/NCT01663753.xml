	<brief_summary>Rationale : The benefit-risk ratio surgery follow concomitant radiochemotherapy brachytherapy remain defined cervical squamous-cell carcinoma ( SCC ) treatment . Scarce study evaluate interest 18F-FDG-PET MRI assessment response treatment surgery . A positive predictive value 75 % find small study make 18F-FDG-PET promising tool assess tumor response guide surgical approach . Diffusion-weighted MRI also describe early sensitive indicator disease . Objectives : The main objective study evaluate sensitivity 18F-FDG-PET assessment cervical cancer response radiochemotherapy brachytherapy . Secondary objective focus 18F-FDG-PET specificity likehood ratio well diffusion-weighted MRI diagnostic performance . Method : We conduct prospective cohort study 148 woman stage IB IIB2 cervical SCC recruit 2.5 year 24 center France . Each patient undergo 18F-FDG-PET diffusion-weighted MRI surgery 8 week completion brachytherapy . The total follow-up duration ( study participation ) patient 11 week : inclusion completion radiochemotherapy brachytherapy , 8 week 18F-FDG-PET diffusion-weighted MRI , 3 week surgery . Expected result : 18F-FDG-PET diffusion-weighted MRI could constitute reliable tool ass response radiochemotherapy brachytherapy cervical SCC treatment . If could improve clinical practice helpful decide whether patient need surgery radiochemotherapy brachytherapy .</brief_summary>
