	<brief_title>Sup-ER Splint Children With Birth Related Brachial Plexus Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The brachial plexus group 5 nerve spinal cord provide movement sensation upper extremity . In difficult delivery , traction shoulder may lead damage brachial plexus result arm paralyzed . This call 'birth relate brachial plexus injury ' ( BRBPI ) . This may occur 1/1000 births nerve may injure minimally severely . About 2/3 child injury recover quite functional level simply maintain looseness joint nerve slowly heal . Some child nerve injury severe enough require surgical reconstruction nerve graft nerve transfer achieve even adequate function . One almost universally common outcome , even child otherwise `` good '' recovery , motion external rotation shoulder supination forearm weaker , later recover , often incomplete . Even beyond direct functional weakness , arm position poorly , joint contracture imbalance motion interfere upper extremity movement like elbow flexion , even elbow flexion well recover . More importantly , lack full motion lead long term change structure , growth , posture shoulder require musculoskeletal surgery , child permanent deformity disability . Surgery completely correct deformity . Any gain active passive range motion first year life may improve long-term shoulder outcome . The investigator institute program early passive reposition mostly use custom Sup-ER ( Supination External Rotation ) splint early growth development improve arm position range motion ER Sup weak . In compliant patient pilot study , speed strength recovery ER Supination improve compare historical control . It novel splint protocol design investigator significantly change care receive patient BC . This study evaluate use Sup-ER splint multiple centre five year period assess arm function common time point recovery .</detailed_description>
