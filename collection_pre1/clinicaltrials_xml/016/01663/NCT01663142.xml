	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease disease complex etiology , multifactorial still poorly understood . This disease , due morbidity mortality , pose significant public health problem France . Apart involvement bacterial factor involve permeability epithelial barrier , well recognize several factor associate genetic predisposition patient . Among factor , Nod2 mutation first identify . Studies concern presence mutation severity disease result sometimes conflict . Very recently , new interesting mutation gene involve autophagy find great frequency patient Crohn 's disease . These mutation observe Atg16 IRGM gene . It particularly show large patient cohort , IRGM polymorphism associate progressive disease , histological severity score . One severity criterion Crohn 's disease early recurrence observe patient surgical resection injure segment . Predictive factor recurrence surgery know .</brief_summary>
