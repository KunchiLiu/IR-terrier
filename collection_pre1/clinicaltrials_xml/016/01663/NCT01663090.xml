	<brief_summary>This research study pilot study evaluate new contrast agent , ferumoxytol , purpose image lymph node metastasis patient soft tissue sarcoma . This contrast agent investigational drug . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve ferumoxytol use . This drug use image adult form cancer , however , use image small number pediatric patient . Ferumoxytol never use image sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start undergo screen procedure confirm eligible participate study . These include medical history , blood test electrocardiogram . After confirm taht eligible study undergo follow . We estimate study approximately two three week . Baseline MRI tumor site drain lymph node : Whether study baseline MRI involve use standard contrast agent call gadolinium . This image test consider standard care method doctor determine tumor location spread . This MRI NOT part study . Ferumoxytol Infusion : You receive study drug day baseline MRI ; already baseline MRI , medication give intravenously ( i.e . directly vein ) next clinical visit . It likewise give central line . You observe infusion 30 minute infusion ensure allergic adverse reaction medication . Repeat MRI tumor site drain lymph node : Three five day receive ferumoxytol , undergo repeat MRI . You require additional contrast prior image study . This MRI part study . Lymph Node Biopsy : You undergo lymph node biopsy whether study . This occur approximately week study MRI . This surgical procedure involve remove one lymph nod region tumor study microscope determine whether contain sign microscopic cancer spread . Your surgeon explain procedure detail . We anticipate clinic visit ferumoxytol take approximately hour . MRI test , average , likewise take approximately hour complete . After complete study MRI lymph node biopsy , require one additional blood test measure blood iron level . We measure iron level ferumoxytol comprise iron core . This iron similar oral iron supplement cause blood iron level temporarily increase . Because try determine whether contrast agent useful , receive teh result study MRI . If however , lymph node find positive disease , treatment plan may change address .</detailed_description>
