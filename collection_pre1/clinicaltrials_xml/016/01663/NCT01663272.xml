	<detailed_description>Preclinical work University Michigan demonstrate inhibition c-Met cabozantinib prevent development metastatic disease intra-cardiac injection model NOD/SCID mouse . Additionally , combination cabozantinib gemcitabine demonstrate improved tumor control compare either agent alone relevant orthotopic implantation mouse model . Combining gemcitabine c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib advance pancreatic cancer novel strategy take advantage establish cytotoxic agent one target pathway know important growth , dissemination , resistance disease .</detailed_description>
