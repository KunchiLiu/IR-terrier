	<brief_summary>High Grade Gliomas , include anaplastic astrocytomas , anaplastic oligodendrogliomas glioblastoma ( GBM ) , common aggressive primary brain tumor . Prognosis patient high-grade glioma remain poor . The estimated median survival patient GBM 12 18 month . Recurrence initial therapy temozolomide radiation nearly universal . Since May 2009 , majority patient US initial recurrence high-grade glioma receive bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , think prevent angiogenesis highly vascular tumor . BEV response rate 32-62 % improved overall median survival patient recurrent high-grade gliomas1 . However , response short live , nearly 100 % patient eventually progress despite bevacizumab . No chemotherapeutic agent administer follow progression bevacizumab make significant impact survival . Patients progress death within 1-5 month resistance develop . Therefore , patient high-grade glioma progress bevacizumab represent population dire need feasible tolerable treatment . NKTR-102 topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate engineer attach irinotecan molecule polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) polymer use biodegradable linker . Irinotecan release NKTR-102 follow administration metabolize active metabolite , 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin ( SN38 ) , cause DNA damage inhibition topoisomerase . The goal design NKTR-102 attenuate eliminate limit side effect irinotecan improve efficacy modify distribution agent within body . The size structure NKTR-102 result mark alteration pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile SN38 derive NKTR-102 compare following irinotecan : maximal plasma concentration ( Cmax ) reduce 5- 10-fold half-life ( t1/2 ) SN38 increase 2 day approximately 50 day . This alter profile lead constant exposure tumor active drug . In addition , large NKTR-102 molecule freely pass intact vasculature , may account relatively high concentration compound active metabolite tumor tissue vivo model , local vasculature may relatively permeable . A 145 mg/m2 dose NKTR-102 , dose intend use phase II clinical trial ( used phase III clinical program ) , result approximately plasma exposure SN38 350 mg/m2 dose irinotecan , exposure protract , result continuous exposure dose cycle low Cmax . NKTR-102 therefore develop new chemotherapeutic agent may improve clinical outcome patient .</brief_summary>

Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) : negative serum pregnancy test ( test require woman unless postmenopausal , define 12 consecutive month since last regular menses , surgically sterile ) . Patients must willing able comply protocol provide write informed consent prior studyspecific screening procedure . Patients meet following criterion must permit entry study . Patients chemotherapy within 28 day , radiotherapy within 28 day , biological therapy within 14 day , investigational therapy within 21 day prior first dose experimental drug . Patients receive prior treatment cancer camptothecin derivative ( eg , irinotecan , topotecan , investigational agent include limited exatecan , rubitecan , gimatecan , karenitecan , SN38 investigational agent , EZN2208 , SN2310 , AR67 ) . Patients follow comorbid disease incurrent illness : 1 . Patients chronic acute GI disorder result diarrhea severity grade ; patient use chronic antidiarrheal supportive care ( 3 days/week ) control diarrhea 28 day prior first dose investigational drug . 2 .
