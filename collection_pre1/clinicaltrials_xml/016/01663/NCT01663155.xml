	<detailed_description>The fight lung cancer wag three major front : prevention , detection treatment . Our goal determine chest x-ray , computer aid detection ( CAD ) CT scan detect disease earlier treatment effective . If improve detection disease , see screen reduces incidence symptomatic advanced lung cancer relative screen people high risk develop lung cancer .</detailed_description>
