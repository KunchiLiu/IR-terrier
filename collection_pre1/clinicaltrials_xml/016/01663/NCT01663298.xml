	<detailed_description>Periodontal wind heal complex multifactorial process involve interaction among various cell , growth factor , hormone extracellular matrix . Although still poorly understood , interaction trigger series event lead new tissue formation . One growth factor play important role wound heal fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) . FGF2 member heparin-binding growth factor family , secrete macrophage endothelial cell . During proliferative healing phase , stimulate fibroblast proliferation &amp; ECM synthesis , increase chemotaxis , proliferation differentiation endothelial cell . During bone remodel phase , FGF2 also stimulate mesenchymal progenitor cell migration . Many animal human study show FGF2 effective periodontal regeneration . In 1999 , Murakami show surgically treat 3-wall intrabony defect dog graft FGF2 able demonstrate significantly great cementum bone formation . Four year later , group find topical application rhbFGF surgically treat class 2 furcation defect dog also show increase formation PDL , cementum bone . In 2008 , Kitamura perform randomize control study human 2- 3-wall intrabony periodontal defect find rhbFGF able stimulate alveolar bone growth PDL regeneration . Recently , epigenetic modification , DNA methylation , associate change pattern gene expression involve change DNA sequence . DNA methylation characterize addition methyl group onto cytokine within CpG region . Methylated CpG region interfere access transcription factor promoter region , thereby silence gene . This DNA methylation phenomenon important regulatory function normal pathological cellular process . It recognize alteration methylation state promoter region tumor suppressor gene implicate cancer . A persistent inflammation also observe cause DNA methylation , inactivate suppressor cytokine signal result exaggerated cytokine production . This make individual susceptible periodontal disease . In laboratory , investigator discover periodontal disease associate increase DNA methylation COX-2 promotor , especially locus immediately adjacent NF-kB promoter region . Preliminary data ( show ) suggest FGF2 may differentially methylated periodontal tissue . Aberrant gene promoter methylation smoker diabetic also report many study . However , role DNA methylation wound heal yet investigate . We hypothesize methylation status FGF2 affect level FGF2 secrete wound heal phase dental implant surgery . We also hypothesize exists difference methylation level FGF2 healthy , smoke diabetic patient interfere wound heal . We seek determine whether DNA methylation play role wound heal whether methylation level FGF2 varies among healthy , smoke diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
