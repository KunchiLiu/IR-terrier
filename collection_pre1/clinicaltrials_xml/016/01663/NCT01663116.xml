	<detailed_description>Traditionally , RA treat non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , glucocorticoid non-biologics-DMARDs . Only non-biologics-DMARDs , less extent , glucocorticoid show able prevent interrupt inflammatory destructive disease process . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) nonhematopoietic stromal cell able differentiate mesenchymal tissue bone , cartilage , muscle , ligament , tendon , adipose . MSCs easily isolate bone marrow adipose tissue rapidly expand culture . MSCs also show immuno-suppressive healing capacity , improve angiogenesis prevent fibrosis . These property could use novel therapeutic application various disorder , include rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis ( OA ) , genetic bone cartilage disorder bone metastasis . MSCs potently modulate immune response , show antiproliferative anti-inflammatory capacity . This study multicenter phase Ib/IIa , escalate dose , single blind clinical trial ass safety intravenous administration expand allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( eASCs ) refractory rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient . The primary objective study determine safety , feasibility tolerance , identify , possible , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) dose future clinical trial efficacy intravenous infusion allogeneic eASCs patient suffer rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) treatment least one non-biologic-Disease modify antirheumatoid drug ( DMARD ) previously fail treatment least two biologics . The secondary objective obtain information clinical functional effect intravenous infusion allogeneic eASCs patient RA explore pharmacodynamics parameter . 53 patient ( i.e . patient receive least one dose study treatment ) three different cohort plan include clinical trial . Expansion start acute toxicity assessment first three patient cohort . Dose interval trial consist follow active group : ) first cohort : 1 million cells/kg administer day 1 , 8 15 ; b ) second cohort : 2 million cell / kg administer day 1 , 8 15 ; c ) third cohort : 4 million cell / kg administer day 1 , 8 15 .</detailed_description>
