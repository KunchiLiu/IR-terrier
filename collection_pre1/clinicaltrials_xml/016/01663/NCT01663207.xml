	<criteria>1 . Ability give inform consent comply study requirement 2 . Overweight obese , generally healthy men woman . Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history ( exception glucose tolerance , see ) , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test . 3 . Glucose Parameters : 1 . Fasting plasma glucose ≥100 mg/dL &lt; 126 mg/dL 2 . 2h postOGTT glucose ≥140 &lt; 200 mg/dL 3 . HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % 4 . Women childbearing potential allow ( must agree use nonhormonal contraception plan become pregnant duration study ) . Must agree maintain contraceptive measure throughout study . Acceptable contraceptive method female subject childbearing potential include one following : Abstinence . One ( 1 ) follow method : Tubal ligation Coppercontaining intrauterine device ( IUD ) Condom AND spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Male partner vasectomy least 6 month . 5 . It require male subject use acceptable method contraception ( outline ) , start first dose study medication continue least 28 day last dose study drug : 1 . Abstinence 2 . A condom AND one following : Vasectomy 6 month . Female partner meet one follow condition : Has tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy ; Is post menopausal ( menopause define age 60 year , 45 60 year amenorrheic least 2 year plasma ( FSH ) level &gt; 30 UI/L ) Or female partner male participant , addition hysterectomy , oophorectorectomy , postmenopausal status , use spermicidal gel foam constitute adequate protection conjunction use condom male . 6 .

Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , neoplastic , allergic clinical finding Screening ( seasonal allergy OK ) . 2 . Any condition possibly affect absorption ( eg , gastrectomy , malabsorption syndrome , abdominal surgery appendectomy , cholecystectomy hysterectomy ) . 3 . Use unacceptable medication 4 . A positive urine drug screen . 5 . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week female 14 drinks/week men ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . 6 . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives precede first dose study medication . 7 . 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec Screening male , 470 msec female . If QTc exceed 450/470 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc value use determine subject 's eligibility . An ECG evidence possible old myocardial infarction need prior ECGs document stability find . 8 . Supine blood pressure &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , single measurement .
