	<brief_summary>- Background study aim ? Some drug use treat HIV ( anti-retrovirals , ARVs ) affect blood level drug use treat TB - call `` drug-drug interaction '' . The main drug use second-line therapy , Aluvia ( lopinavir/ritonavir ) , one drug effect . This people second-line ARVs usually use one main TB drug , `` rifampicin '' , instead prescribe slightly different drug call `` rifabutin '' , less affected drug-drug interaction . Although blood level rifabutin badly affect Aluvia blood level rifampicin , rifabutin level blood still increase lot take Aluvia time . This could lead high level side-effects drug body . So past doctor suggest instead take rifabutin every day Aluvia , take three time week , Mondays , Wednesdays Fridays . However , last 2 year , new study suggest three time week regimen might enough may completely cure TB . So purpose study find whether take rifabutin every day Aluvia really lead side-effects , whether take rifabutin three time week Aluvia really lead much low level rifabutin blood . - Who participate ? This substudy specifically people already take anti-TB drug EARNEST , need start anti-TB drug whilst EARNEST trial . - What study involve ? Participants select ( chance , choose computer ) one follow two rifabutin group : Group 1 : Rifabutin ( 150 mg ) take three time week Monday/Wednesday/Friday Group 2 : Rifabutin ( 150 mg ) take every day On day , one capsule rifabutin ( 150 mg ) take morning mouth . Participants ask attend clinic 2 12 week enter sub-study every 6 week end TB treatment , return usual EARNEST follow-up schedule . This roughly visit schedule people TB usually see frequently without TB , whether patient join sub-study . The 2 week visit specifically investigator make sure participant OK rifabutin check carefully n't side-effects . At visit ( include day participant enroll substudy ) investigator take extra 10 ml ( two teaspoon ) blood laboratory test side-effects rifabutin , measure level rifabutin ARVs blood - call `` pharmacokinetic '' `` PK '' study . On day visit , participant take dose rifabutin blood draw , investigator measure low amount drug likely blood . Instead , participant bring rifabutin dose clinic , take straight blood draw . At visit 12 week start rifabutin , participant need stay clinic second blood draw ~3 ml ( half teaspoon ) around 4 hour take rifabutin dose immediately first blood draw . We use second sample see quickly rifabutin enters blood . At special visit investigator make sure participant first see early possible , n't stay longer necessary second blood draw take 4 hour later . After participant complete TB treatment stay EARNEST end trial ( 144 week second-line therapy ) . - What possible benefit risk participate ? If participant allocate Group 1 ( 150 mg rifabutin three time week ) , risk may lower level rifabutin blood may less effective treating TB . However , participant few side-effects . In contrast , participant allocate Group 2 ( 150 mg rifabutin daily ) , risk may get side-effects , level rifabutin blood high enough good chance cure TB . Having blood take may cause discomfort and/or bruise people . It currently impossible know rifabutin regimen would best participant may find year come may may receive best treatment . - Where study run ? 9 EARNEST site Uganda follow : JCRC Kampala , IDI , San Raphael St Francis Hospital ( Nsambya ) , JCRC Mbarara , JCRC Mbale , JCRC Kabale , JCRC Kakira , JCRC Gulu - When study start long expect run ? Start 05/03/2012 finish 31/01/2014 - Who fund study ? Abbott</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EARNEST Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Summary Background aim The standard anti-tuberculosis drug , rifampicin , major drug-drug interaction cornerstone second-line therapy resource-limited setting , lopinavir/ritonavir ( Aluvia tablet ) . Concomitant administration rifampicin lopinavir/ritonavir reduces lopinavir/ritonavir level large degree HIV control compromise , resistance may develop . Therefore international national guideline recommend rifampicin use lopinavir/ritonavir , rather recommend rifabutin use instead possible . The current recommendation use reduce dose 150 mg rifabutin thrice weekly administer boosted protease inhibitor ( bPI ) base pharmacokinetic study healthy volunteer demonstrate substantial drug-drug interaction lead increase rifabutin level standard dos . However , also concern reduce dose resulting level rifabutin might lead failure anti-tuberculosis therapy TB relapse . Further , general concern entire class rifamycins sub-optimally dose throughout history anti-tuberculosis treatment . One barrier use high dose rifabutin boost protease inhibitor potential substantial increase toxicity , particular risk uveitis well-recognised side effect high dose rifabutin . This pilot randomise open-label pharmacokinetic substudy therefore compare 150 mg rifabutin daily versus thrice weekly , combination lopinavir/ritonavir take part second-line ART EARNEST trial second-line antiretroviral therapy , term ( ) toxicity ( ii ) pharmacokinetics rifabutin , lopinavir/ritonavir , raltegravir participant enrol arm B main EARNEST trial ) ( iii ) PK/PD ( pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ) relationship . - Trial design A parallel two group , open-label , multi-centre , randomise control pilot trial , embed within large randomise control trial ( EARNEST ) . - Detailed Background Tuberculosis one common opportunistic infection HIV-infected people take antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Concomitant use rifampicin many antiretroviral drug complicate drug-drug interaction cause potent induction gene involve drug metabolism transport rifampicin , result subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug concentration . Drug-drug interaction rifampicin ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( bPI ) , cornerstone second-line therapy follow WHO public health approach ART , mark non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) commonly use first-line therapy , therapeutic lopinavir concentration achieve substantially increased dos lopinavir/ritonavir ritonavir ( `` super-boosting '' ) . However , lead high rate hepatotoxicity healthy volunteer HIV-infected adult . The importance lopinavir/ritonavir `` backbone '' risk loss HIV control development resistance concomitant administration rifampicin consider large , thus international national guideline recommend rifampicin use lopinavir/ritonavir , rather recommend rifabutin use instead possible . This alternative strategy replace rifampicin rifabutin follow resource-rich setting . Pharmacokinetic study healthy volunteer demonstrate substantial increase rifabutin level give standard dose 300 mg daily together bPI , current dosing recommendation 150 mg rifabutin thrice weekly administer bPI . However , also concern reduce dose , result level rifabutin might inadequate ( example , 9/10 patient low maximum concentration value rifabutin TB minimum inhibitory concentration study Boulanger et al ) , , together intermittent dose companion antituberculosis drug , could lead failure anti-tuberculosis therapy TB relapse . A recent PK study 16 African patient confirm rifabutin level low standard care dose coadministered boosted lopinavir . Further , general concern entire class rifamycins sub-optimally dose throughout history antituberculosis treatment . One barrier use high dose rifabutin boost protease inhibitor potential substantial increase toxicity , particular risk uveitis ( inflammation middle layer eye ) well-recognised side effect high dose rifabutin . A second potential concern high dose rifabutin may also increase lopinavir level , albeit less extent interaction opposite direction . Studies rifabutin-PI drug-drug interaction healthy volunteer hamper occurrence adverse event unacceptable healthy population , whereas clinical management patient TB need optimise therapeutic efficacy may lead high threshold discontinuing therapy reduce dose . EARNEST open , parallel group , randomise control trial 1277 HIV-infected adult adolescent switch first- second-line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The trial conduct fourteen centre five country ( Malawi , Uganda , Zimbabwe , Kenya Zambia ) . Enrolment start April 2010 , finish April 2011 . All EARNEST participant second-line regimen base boosted protease inhibitor ( bPI ) , Aluvia , follow WHO guideline . The randomisation whether bPI support standard care 2NRTIs ( Arm A ) , drug new integrase inhibitor class , raltegravir ( Arm B ) , raltegravir induction period 12 week , move bPI maintenance monotherapy ( Arm C ) . Each participant follow 144 week , total duration trial 4 year ( trial closure end 2013 ) . This substudy enrol patient initiated second-line bPI-containing ART within EARNEST . - Those patient develop TB EARNEST follow-up . All patient EARNEST receive lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen therefore initiate rifabutin-containing TB treatment per guideline ( rifampicin contra-indicated ) . These patient enrol sub-study soon possible start TB treatment . - Those patient already establish rifabutin-based TB treatment time sub-study screening least 10 week remain complete course TB treatment . It anticipate substantial minority EARNEST participant develop TB trial follow-up , already maintenance anti-TB therapy substudy entry . The fact patient follow long term part EARNEST provide unique opportunity collect short longer-term data incidence adverse event , well pharmacokinetic data , within context large EARNEST trial . - Substudy objective Given concern potential under-exposure rifabutin currently recommend dose 150 mg thrice weekly bPI , pilot randomise open-label pharmacokinetic substudy therefore compare 150 mg rifabutin daily versus thrice weekly combination lopinavir/ritonavir take part second-line ART EARNEST trial , term : ( ) toxicity ( ii ) pharmacokinetics rifabutin , lopinavir/ritonavir , raltegravir ( participant enrol arm B main EARNEST trial ) ( iii ) PK/PD ( pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ) relationship . - Substudy hypothesis The dose rifabutin currently recommend concomitant administration lopinavir/ritonavir ( 150 mg 3 x week ) increase 150 mg daily without significantly increase toxicity whilst provide improve rifabutin exposure .</detailed_description>
