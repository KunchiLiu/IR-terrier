	<brief_summary>Although pre-procedural neutrophil lymphocyte ratio ( N/L ) associate adverse outcome among patient coronary artery disease , role acute phase ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) fully investigate . This study seek investigate association pre-procedural N/L ratio within-hospital long-term outcome among STEMI patient undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammation play role initiation progression atherosclerotic process . Due grow recognition role , recent study focus inflammatory marker association outcomes patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Recently , single center study demonstrate preprocedural neutrophil/lymphocyte ( N/L ) ratio independent predictor impair coronary flow primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) in-hospital major advanced cardiac event ( MACE ) patient STEMI.Several previous study also evaluate role N/L ratio long-term outcome among patient STEMI ; however , evaluate association long-term mortality in-hospital N/L ratio , single-center study evaluate relatively small study population . In present multicenter experience , investigator aim investigate association preprocedural N/L ratio in-hospital long-term outcome patient STEMI undergo primary PCI .</detailed_description>
