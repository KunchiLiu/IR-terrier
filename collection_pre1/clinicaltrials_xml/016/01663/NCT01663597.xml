	<brief_summary>Aberrations play significant role visual process divide lower-order higher-order aberration . The former measure use commercially available IOL Master ( Carl Zeiss Meditec AG , Germany ) profound influence visual acuity . Higher-order aberration significantly influence visual acuity affect quality vision cause halo , double vision , night vision disturbance . Background Cataract surgery become routine procedure develop country . During surgery , foldable intraocular lens usually insert capsular bag . However , lenses account individual optical biometry data aberration . Therefore , important provide data ametropic emmetropic eye information might improve future intraocular lens design lead individually adapt lens yield optimal visual acuity quality result . The aim present study clarify correlation refractive errors/axial eye length spherical aberration cornea .</brief_summary>
