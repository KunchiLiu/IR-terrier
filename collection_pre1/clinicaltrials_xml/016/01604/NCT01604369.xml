	<brief_title>Cryoablation Standard Treatment Atrial Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial flutter ( AFL ) , common atrial tachyarrhythmia may cause significant symptom serious adverse effect include embolic stroke , myocardial ischemia congestive heart failure . Currently , radiofrequency ( RF ) catheter ablation cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI ) consider first-line therapy treatment CTI-dependent AFL . However , RF ablation CTI associate significant pain lesion delivery . Furthermore , RF ablation potentially injure cardiac structure adjacent CTI AV node , tricuspid valve right coronary artery . RF ablation also lead steam pop , cardiac tamponade fatal complication also report association CTI-ablation . Ablation use cryothermal energy ( Cryo ) several potential advantage RF ablation include great catheter stability due adherence myocardial tissue application , reduce risk thrombus formation , systemic embolization , low risk myocardial perforation due preservation tissue architecture . The investigator prospective randomize , single centre study ( CRAFT ) investigate efficacy safety RF versus Cryo atrial flutter , show cryoablation effective RF ablation short long term . The patient perceive significantly less pain require significantly low dos analgesia sedation cryoablation compare RF ablation . The study power non-inferiority 75 patient group . The objective present study expand finding CRAFT study large cohort patient , let operator experience cryothermic CTI ablation use Cryo standard therapy focus efficacy , feasibility , procedure time , patient content . To perform ablation within study , electrophysiologist must previous experience minimum 25 cryoablations atrial flutter .</detailed_description>
