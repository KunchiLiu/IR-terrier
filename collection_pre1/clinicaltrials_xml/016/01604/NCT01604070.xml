	<brief_summary>Hammertoe deformity common deformity lesser toe . It primarily comprise flexion deformity proximal interphalangeal ( PIP ) joint toe , hyperextension metatarsophalangeal ( MTP ) . Etiologies hammertoe deformity include foot second ray longer first , MTP synovitis instability , inflammatory arthropathy , neuromuscular condition , ill-fitting shoe wear . When foot 's second ray longer first shoe wear fit correctly , flexion PIP joint occur accommodate shoe . This length difference also cause MTP synovitis develop overuse second MTP joint . Attenuation collateral ligament plantar plate result , MTP joint hyperextends may even progress dorsal subluxation dislocation ( see image ) . Rheumatoid arthritis cause hammertoe deformity progressive MTP joint destruction , lead MTP joint subluxation dislocation . With 3 etiology , extensor digitorum longus ( EDL ) tendon gradually lose mechanical advantage PIP joint , flexor digitorum longus ( FDL ) tendon MTP joint . The intrinsic muscle fire sublux dorsally , MTP hyperextend . They extend MTP joint flex PIP joint , oppose usual function flex MTP joint extend PIP joint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Device Description : Nextra implant anatomical 2-piece design implant 10Â° angulation lock fusion mechanism . The self-centering , metaphysis screw design allow stable secure relationship proximal middle phalanx . The compression progressive tightening approximate bone surface control fusion . Pre-clinical Data : The Nextra Implant use create fusion proximal middle phalanx 2nd , 3rd . 4th . toe . Clinical Experience : The NextraTM Implant use human implant reduce hammertoe contracture deformity . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES : The primary objective evaluate post-market safety performance NextraTM reduction post-operative pain symptom hammertoe demonstrate efficacy implant securely stabilize bone surface fuse compare K-wire fixation . 3 . STUDY DESIGN : General Design : Preoperative post-operative factor assess evaluation efficacy safety .</detailed_description>
