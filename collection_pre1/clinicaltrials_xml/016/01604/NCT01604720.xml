	<brief_title>Sample Size Definition Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim answer question Questions - How large proportion recent hepato-biliary RCTs report adequate sample size estimation ? - Primary outcome clearly define ? clinical meaningful ? - Is sample size calculation base primary outcome ? - Does predict control event rate coincide actual one ? - What predict intervention effect ? - Are confidence interval primary outcome result report ? Is evidence difference two arm ? - Is effect size large ( &gt; 50 % ) suggest post hoc definition ? - What accept error alpha beta ? - How many study comply usual rule alpha = 5 % beta = 20 % ? - Do trial plan sample size well without ? Is overlap CI result less frequent ? Are result frequently `` statistical '' significant ? - Do trial plan sample frequently agree pool result meta-analysis ? - Has protocol publish public register inclusion participant ? - How often intention-to-treat analysis employ primary analysis ? - How often trial result rest upon subgroup analysis ? Methods : All randomize clinical trial include systematic review Cochrane Hepato-biliary group ( accord search 272 ) detect retrieve . Only two arm , parallel group superiority randomise control trial single primary outcome . The investigator exclude report study design factorial , cluster , crossover For select article , investigator systematically retrieve assessed full publish report trial , extra material appendix available online , study design article , cite , detail online registration trial , mention . A standardised data collection form generate basis review literature priori discussion test research team .</detailed_description>
