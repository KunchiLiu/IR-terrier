	<brief_title>A Study CNTO 136 ( Sirukumab ) , Administered Subcutaneously , Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug ( DMARD ) Therapy ( SIRROUND-D )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign treatment group , study personnel know identity treatment give . Some patient receive placebo , resemble medication , contain active substance . This help determine study agent effective . Patients receive placebo sirukumab injection skin . The expected duration study 120 week , include 104 week treatment . Participants complete participation study eligible inclusion long-term safety efficacy study , enrollment participate site available . If participate long-term study , continue safety follow-up approximately 16 week . The placebo-controlled portion study Week 52 , placebo patient cross one two sirukumab dose regimen . Patient safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
