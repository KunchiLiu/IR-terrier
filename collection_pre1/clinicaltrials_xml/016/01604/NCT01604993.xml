	<detailed_description>Hypertension become common medical condition worldwide , raise public concern regard accompany increase cardiovascular disease risk health risk . Targets optimal blood pressure often unmet conventional pharmaceutical therapy ; consequently , complementary alternative medicine increase popularity among patient wish good manage BP . In case hypertension , endothelial dysfunction cardiovascular disease , decline ability blood vessel dilate response shear stress major contributor vascular pathology . At core condition decrease ability synthesize nitric oxide , potent vasodilatory agent . The propose study examine whether increase intake dietary nitrate , convert nitric oxide endogenously , improve three index vascular function validate risk factor CVD : arterial stiffness , measure aortic augmentation index ( AIx ) , aortic BP brachial BP .</detailed_description>
