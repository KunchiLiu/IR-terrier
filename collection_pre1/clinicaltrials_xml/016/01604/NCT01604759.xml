	<brief_summary>In study investigator conduct research determine whether new optical device use polarization reflectance spectroscopy help doctor dentists identify abnormality mouth require follow-up . To establish , measurement need large number individual different abnormality mouth . The investigator believe propose approach potential improve enable mass screen precancerous early cancer oral cavity improve predictive value oral cavity exam , particularly less experienced practitioner . The information study compare result pathology report tissue take mouth . Hypothesis : 1 . Polarized reflectance spectroscopy distinguish high-risk oral lesion normal reactive oral lesion . 2 . Polarized reflectance spectroscopy capture low-grade oral lesion characteristic associate high risk progression cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinician place fiber-optic probe design measure polarize reflectance spectrum visible optical region site interest subject 's mouth , include lesional mucosa , normal adjacent contralateral mucosa . The site placement probe determine examiner , experienced Oral Pathologist . The probe examination take 15 minute addition subject 's appointment time routine visit . A 4um unstained tissue section surgery biopsy , part schedule care , request quantitative histological analysis . The morphometric parameter obtain polarized reflectance measurement compare histology quantitative pathology ( nuclear phenotype score ) tissue section lesion . The collected spectra data normal look area adjacent normal look mucosa contralateral mucosa use determine patient patient variation polarize reflectance oral mucosa .</detailed_description>
