	<brief_summary>PURPOSE - The purpose study identify determine miRNA expression target biological treatment psoriatic patient . HYPOTHESIS - Changes expression specific miRNAs play important role cytokine expression profile see lesional psoriatic skin . miRNAs may therefore serve potential target future anti-psoriatic treatment well possible predictor biological treatment response . PERSPECTIVES - The result novel research project increase investigator understand underlie mechanism lead psoriasis . Furthermore possible predictor treatment response identify . Identification biomarkers predict treatment outcome individualize patient care , reduce number treatment failure thereby tremendous socio-economic impact increase patient quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Psoriasis chronic inflammatory skin disease affect 2-3 % population worldwide tremendously impact patient ' quality life . Progress make understand cellular immunology biology psoriasis , ultimate cause psoriasis still unknown . miRNA ~22 nt noncoding RNAs modulate gene expression post-transcriptional level . miRNAs regulatory role development , differentiation , growth control apoptosis . AIM OF PROJECT : To identify psoriasis specific miRNA . To investigate difference miRNA expression target lesional non-lesional psoriatic skin . To investigate change miRNA expression biological treatment . METHODS : Patients include adult ( &gt; 18 year ) psoriasis vulgaris go treated biological drug independent project ( accord national guideline ) . A sign informed consent obtain patient include project . Patients allow received local treatment 2 week inclusion systemic treatment include UVB 6 week inclusion . 4 mm punch-biopsies lesional non-lesional psoriatic skin obtain use local anaesthetic contain 1 % Lidocaine day 0 four time treatment follow day 4 , 14 , 28 84 . Before treatment patient monitor clinical score include PASI , BSA PGA . Clinical evaluation conduct trained dermatologist day 0 day 84 . That allow u compare clinical change finding obtain study . miRNA mRNA expression analysis quantitativePCR , protein level ELISA cell proliferation measure standard cell proliferation assay . miRNA microarray commercially available use identify miRNA interest . NOVELTY : Changes expression miRNA psoriasis miRNA regulation treatment psoriasis sparsely study . The result research project therefore increase understand underlying mechanism lead psoriasis may generate important new tool individualise treatment psoriasis .</detailed_description>
