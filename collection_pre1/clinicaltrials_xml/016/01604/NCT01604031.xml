	<brief_summary>This research study determine safety effectiveness use special cell may make subject 's immune system fight chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) combination drug call Lenalidomide . To , investigator put special gene cancer cell take subject . This do laboratory . This gene make cell produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , natural substance may help subject 's immune system kill cancer cell . Additionally , investigator stimulate cancer cell normal embryonic fibroblast ( cell develop normal connective tissue body ) make another natural protein call CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) . Some cell put back subject 's body goal act like vaccine stimulate immune system attack CLL cell . The investigator already conduct study similar subject CLL . In subject investigator saw change subject 's immune system might indicate modify cell help immune system fight cancer . However , subject change immune system go away injection stop . The investigator think may due high level cell call T regulatory cell . T regulatory cell part immune system prevent excessive reaction cell body . Studies show reduce T regulatory cell allow body fight cancer longer period time . Recent study show use Lenalidomide help body reduce T regulatory cell . Using Lenalidomide along injection ( shot ) might help body fight cancer longer period time . Lenalidomide also call Revlimid . In study investigator want see make change immune system last longer give Lenalidomide time vaccine . The investigator hope might produce good response direct CLL cell . Subjects receive injection year</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment B-CLL With Autologous IL2 CD40 Ligand-Expressing Tumor Cells + Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously , cancer cell take subject 's body separate laboratory specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry IL-2 gene put cell . Adenovirus common virus find human respiratory system . In normal state , reproduce cause respiratory infection . Respiratory illness cause adenovirus infection range common cold pneumonia , croup bronchitis . This adenovirus change laboratory likely reproduce cause infection body . The gene transfer method use study try add copy IL2 gene increase immune response tumor . The rest cancer cell stimulate express surface substance call human CD40L . These substance ( IL-2 CD40L ) , already naturally present body , mean help immune system fight cancer . At point doctor feel subject begin treatment protocol , treatment follow : The subject begin take Allopurinol mouth 300 mg continue take Allopurinol daily 14 day . Allopurinol also call Zyloprim take prevent tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome serious condition occur sometimes cancer treatment start . Tumor lysis syndrome cause medical problem . Two day Allopurinol start , subject begin take Lenalidomide . The Lenalidomide dose 5 mg take mouth daily . The subject swallow capsule whole water time day break , chew open capsule . Females childbearing potential caring subject touch lenalidomide capsule bottle without glove . If dose lenalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . If prescribe dose take lenalidomide subject feel poorly , s/he seek emergency medical care tell study staff right away . The subject get 1 cycle drug per month . A max 28-day supply drug provide one time . If subject bad side effect doctor may tell him/her take lenalidomide short time period may remove study . Otherwise , subject continue daily dose Lenalidomide approximately 1 year , four week final vaccine . Four week subject start Lenalidomide s/he start receive his/her vaccine . The vaccine inject skin ( also call subcutaneously ) . Normally subject shot outpatient ( overnight stay hospital require ) . S/he receive first five ( 5 ) shot 2 week interval . S/he receive eleven ( 11 ) shot 4 weekly interval . In total , subject may receive sixteen ( 16 ) shot period one year . As Lenalidomide subject bad side effect s/he may receive his/her vaccine short period time may remove study . Otherwise , subject receive vaccine schedule specify earlier paragraph . These shot must give Houston Methodist Hospital . Following injection , doctor follow subject 1 year last shot see subject . TESTS DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT : A complete history physical examination necessary subject enrol study . A physical examination also perform time s/he receives shoot modify cell . The place subject 's body s/he receive shot examine physical exam . Research Blood Samples : Blood take tube place vein ( IV ) . We take blood sample follow time point : study entry , week 0 subject start Lenalidomide , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 16 every 4 week week 60 . The last blood sample one year last shot . We make sure Lenalidomide work correctly study modify cell work body . The amount blood obtain time approximately 2-3 tablespoonful , consider safe amount . If subject central line ( IV line place large blood vessel mean use long periods time ) , blood take , extra `` stick '' need . Additional office visit may necessary obtain blood . The maximum total amount blood collect subject 40-60 tablespoon . Other test : If subject woman get pregnant , pregnancy counsel urine test long take lenalidomide . In order participate study , subject must register follow requirement Revlimid REMS速 program Celgene Corporation ( company supply Lenalidomide ) . This program provide education counsel risk fetal exposure , blood clot reduce blood count occur take Lenalidomide . The subject require receive counseling every 28 day treatment lenalidomide , follow pregnancy test birth control requirement program appropriate him/her take telephone survey regard compliance program . Participating Revlimid REMS速 program study requirement .</detailed_description>
