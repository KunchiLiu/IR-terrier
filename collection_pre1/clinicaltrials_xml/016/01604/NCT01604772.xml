	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Progressive , Recurrent , Metastatic Adenoid Cyst Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine confirm response rate patient progressive , recurrent/metastatic adenoid cyst carcinoma ( ACC ) treat v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) inhibitor MK2206 ( MK-2206 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , safety/tolerability MK-2206 patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore potential genetic/cytogenetic/histopathologic predictor clinical outcome ( i.e. , response , PFS , OS ) MK-2206 . II . To explore hypothesis MK-2206-mediated Akt inhibition downregulation v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog ( c-myb ) protein level ACC tumor correlate clinical outcome ( i.e. , response , PFS , OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) weekly 4 week . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
