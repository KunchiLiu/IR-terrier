	<brief_summary>Apomivir® extract proprietary spirulina strain , FEM-101 , kind blue cyanobacterium patent freeze-thaw lysis extraction method . According preclinical study , Apomivir® proven excellent broad-spectrum anti-viral ability , especially seasonal influenza virus ( Influenza virus A B ) may cause illness , paralysis even death , especially child elderly people . This phase II study design evaluate efficacy safety Apomivir® ( 120 mg b.i.d . ) subject seasonal influenza .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigate Efficacy Safety Apomivir®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , parallel , placebo-controlled , multi-center study . Approximately 196 subject fever define body temperature &gt; = 38˚C , least one respiratory symptom one constitutional symptom invite study target 156 evaluable subject . A nasopharyngeal/throat swab rapid test influenza A B conducted subject positive result could recruit . All eligible subject randomize one follow treatment group 1:1 ratio . Study Group : Apomivir® 1 capsule ( 120 mg/cap ) twice daily 5 day Control Group : Placebo 1 capsule twice daily 5 day A pack acetaminophen ( 500 mg ) provide enrollment . All flu symptom relief agent could use rescue use persistent fever flu symptom ( &gt; = 24 hour ) . A digital thermometer diary card dispense baseline ( Day 1 ) . Subjects instruct complete body temperature record , daily record regard severity influenza symptom level interference daily activity . The monitoring frequency twice daily ( drug administration ) Day 1 Day 5 , cut daily Day 29 complete cure ( define remission flu symptom interference ) . Treatment failure define secondary illness , antibiotic use hospitalization due disease progression . For safety efficacy assessment , subject return Day 3 , 6 15 . For subject completely cure Day 15 ( Visit 4 ) , therapy conducted return Day 29 ; completely cure , telephone follow-up conduct Day 29 . The severity fever score use 4-point scale : 0 = &lt; 37.2°C 1 . = &gt; = 37.2 &lt; 38.0°C 2 . = &gt; = 38.0 &lt; 39.0°C 3 . = &gt; = 39.0 °C Other influenza symptom ( cough , nasal obstruction , sore throat , fatigue , headache myalgia ) also assess use 4-point scale : 0 = none , 1 . = mild , 2 . = moderate , 3 . = severe The level interference daily activity ( include running , lift heavy object , participate strenuous sport , moderate activity ) , move table , push vacuum clean , bowling , play golf , lift carry grocery , climb several flight stair , climb one flight stair , bending , kneeling , stoop , walk mile , walk several block , walk one block , bath dressing , assess accord 3-point scale 0 = , limit 1 . = yes , limited little 2 . = yes , limited lot Confirmatory test infective virus strain , real-time RT-PCR viral culture conduct baseline . In follow study visit , real-time RT-PCR perform measure influenza viral load/titer nasopharyngeal/throat swabs specimen . For completely cured prior Day 15 , real-time RT-PCR assessment could omit Day 29 . All subject enrol followed end study , subject influenza PCR viral culture positive could evaluable population .</detailed_description>
