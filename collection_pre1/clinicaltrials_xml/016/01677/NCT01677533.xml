	<detailed_description>Objective : The specific aim study : ( 1 ) identify health professional educational clinical microsystem determinant outcomes hypertension smoke cessation veteran . ( 2 ) test efficacy three increasingly intensive method implement panel management strategy among health care provider VA primary care clinic : provide panel data , provide panel management support , provide support plus clinical microsystem-enhancing education training . Research design : This project consist two phase . Phase I ( one year ) development necessary measurement data infrastructure ass health professional education , microsystem function , clinical outcome . In Phase 2 ( two year ) study team conduct clinical demonstration project , compare three intervention randomize controlled trial . Primary care team randomly allocate one three arm : 1 ) panel management data , 2 ) panel management data support , 3 ) panel management data , support education . The investigator assess impact implementation panel management primary patient outcome hypertension smoke cessation ( blood pressure quit rate ) . The investigative team also assess impact implementation panel management secondary , intermediary , patient ( patient activation , adherence , behavior change ) , provider ( knowledge attitude , self-efficacy , job satisfaction ) microsystem outcome ( collective efficacy , teamwork , use data , redesign patient process provider roles/responsibilities , use panel management strategy ) . Methodology : The study utilize multi-method , quasi-experimental design VA NYHHS . Primary care deliver two team Manhattan five team Brooklyn campus . Patients , staff , nurse , physician assign specific team , thereby limit contamination study .</detailed_description>
