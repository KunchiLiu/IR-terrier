	<brief_summary>Blood pressure typically measure non-invasive cuff place upper arm . This cuff take accurate measurement patient 's arm moving . Anesthesia cesarean delivery frequently cause patient shiver arm shake , sometimes extent blood pressure measure . A cuff place wrist may effective patient shiver low arm move less easily stabilize . We take simultaneous blood pressure measurement cesarean delivery order compare blood pressure upper arm versus wrist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upper arm non-invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) measurement commonly accept method blood pressure ( BP ) monitoring . During cesarean delivery may challenge obtain accurate measurement automate device 50 % attempt due arm movement.1 Patients may voluntarily move arm , often neuraxial ( spinal , epidural , combine spinal-epidural ) anesthesia know induce shiver cause patient 's arm shake.2 To eliminate effect movement upper arm , NIBP test leg immobilized neuraxial anesthesia . However , study monitor NIBP ankle calf unable accurately detect change ( increase decrease ) blood pressure patient undergoing cesarean delivery.3,4 It seem clinically reasonable case shiver patient , forearm , less muscle mass , would shake less could stabilize easily upper arm ( stabilize forearm easily do hold patient 's hand light pressure arm rest ) . Therefore , position NIBP cuff forearm ( near wrist ) may useful obtain accurate blood pressure measurement shiver patient . Previous study find forearm BP overestimate blood pressure measure upper arm variety clinical setting patient population static ( patient rest , submit intervention might alter BP ) circumstances.5-8 It unknown whether overestimation clinically relevant blood pressure change occur rapidly , cesarean delivery . During neuraxial anesthesia cesarean delivery , important anesthesiologist know absolute value clinically significant change blood pressure determine treatment . The detection dynamic change blood pressure ( patient submit intervention might alter BP per se , e.g . neuraxial anesthesia ) study obstetric patient . Nevertheless , either due location BP cuff placed4 ( low limb interference aorto-caval compression ) technology use measure blood pressure,9 ( penaz technology consistent oscillometric technology previous study ) forearm blood pressure comparable upper arm blood pressure measure use oscillometric monitor . This study compare upper arm ( current gold-standard ) forearm NIBP measurements patient undergo elective cesarean delivery subarachnoid anesthesia . We hypothesize forearm systolic BP measurement value within 10 % ( low high ) systolic BP value measure upper arm time-points</detailed_description>
