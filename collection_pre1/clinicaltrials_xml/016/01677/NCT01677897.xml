	<criteria>Metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate . Patient must give write informed consent registration . Age ≥18 year . WHO performance status 02 . Tumor progression ( define ) least 1 hormonal treatment ( orchiectomy , LHRH agonist ) document total testosterone level ≤ 1.7 nmol/L ( ≤ 50 ng/dL ) . Ongoing concurrent use LHRH agonist require patient surgically castrate . PSA progression treatment abiraterone ( least 12 week treatment ) define follow : In case PSA level decrease treatment : ≥ 25 % increase baseline ( registration ) AND increase absolute PSA value ≥ 5 ng/mL . In case PSA response &lt; 50 % treatment : ≥ 25 % increase nadir AND increase absolute PSA value ≥ 5 ng/mL . In case PSA response ≥ 50 % treatment : ≥ 50 % increase nadir AND increase absolute PSA value ≥ 5 ng/mL Note : PSA progression confirm least 1 week later . In case confirmation first date PSA rise relevant calculation . Serum potassium ≥ 3.5mmol/L . Adequate hematological value : neutrophil ≥1.5x109/L , platelet ≥100x109/L . Adequate hepatic function : bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN , ALT ≤2.5 x ULN . Adequate renal function ( calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min , accord formula CockcroftGault ) . Able swallow study drug whole tablet . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow proper stag followup . Previous malignancy within 2 year exception localize nonmelanoma skin cancer Ta Tis bladder cancer . Known CNS spinal cord metastasis . Active autoimmune disease require high dos corticosteroid equivalent prednisone 10mg/d . Radiotherapy within last 2 week start trial treatment .
