	<brief_summary>Pre-emptive local anaesthetic widely use laparoscopic surgery , really consistent evidence useful . Studies literature show contradicting result . At hospital currently use pre-emptive local anaesthetic trocar area , literature give clear clinically relevant answer , need find . This study aim see pre-emptive local anaesthetic useful set day-case , laparoscopic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-emptive Local Anaesthesia Gynecological Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design prospective , randomize , double-blinded parallel assignment . It compare pre-emptive incisional injection bupivacaine , 5 mg/ml , placebo injection ( saline ) . The clinically relevant comparison probably injection local anaesthetic injection . However study design like would make blind impossible probably acceptable research design study aim publish . The aim study test pre-emptive injection long-lasting , local anaesthetic reduce post-operative pain . As local anaesthetic already implement routine , hypothesis positive effect reduce postoperative pain . The null hypothesis difference local anaesthetic placebo . The recruitment patient daily surgery , consecutive patient eligible day-case , laparoscopic surgery ask participate . To clinically important reduction post-operative pain difference 2 unit 0-10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) choose sample size calculation . A small difference pain score consider clinically relevant opinion . With power least 80 % give 20 patient total , 10 arm . The power calculation do statistician S. Johnsen University Surrey . We include 24 patient altogether cover loss follow-up . The drop-out rate clinical trial usually estimate 20 % , would give 25 patient include ( 20/ ( 1-0.2 ) = 25 ) . This study , however , short follow-up period , drop-out rate expect small . Drop-outs record account . 24 participant randomize block 6 patient . Block randomization choose avoid pool chance . All procedures do one surgeon . This might subject criticism one say result study true one surgeon particular setting . But need standardization important study like , point Wilder-Smith ( Wilder-Smith , O. H. 2000 ) . The time randomization identify breakage study drug vial . If potential candidate find satisfy exclusion criterion withdraw consent vial open , patient randomise . The study ID number study drug vial make available next potential candidate . If potential candidate exclude reason breakage vial completion injection study drug , study ID number cod Protocol Violation exclude statistical analysis . The patient , nurse staff surgeon blind substance inject . Infiltration primary , umbilical site blind , close fascia possible . The secondary port infiltration do visual guidance laparoscope , fascia close peritoneum . Bupivacaine concentration 5 mg/ml use 5 ml solution inject port site . The patient get placebo get 5 ml physiologic saline inject port site . The primary outcome study movement-evoked pain ( MEP ) 5 hour surgery , half-life bupivacaine 4-6 hour . Movement-evoked pain important outcome measure , goal get patient back normal , daily activity soon possible . Trials measure movement evoke pain pain rest ( PAR ) suggest MEP much intense PAR postoperative ( Srikandarajah et al , 2011 ) . Pain measured 10 cm long Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) 0 cm pain 10 cm severe pain . NRS validate good tool pain measurement different age education level ( Gagliese et al , 2005 ) . Secondary outcome measure pain rest 2 5 hour postoperative , use rescue analgesic . Pain rest must , course , record movement evoke pain . The pain score do patient help nurse ward 2 5 hour postoperative , blind arm patient .</detailed_description>
