	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose MLN8237 ( alisertib ) give together paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( nab-paclitaxel ) treat patient solid malignancy metastatic remove surgery . Alisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , nab-paclitaxel work kill cell stop divide . Giving alisertib together nab-paclitaxel may provide effective anticancer treatment few side effect .</brief_summary>
