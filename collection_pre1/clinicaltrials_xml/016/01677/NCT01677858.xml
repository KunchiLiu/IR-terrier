	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 , multicenter , single-arm , nonrandomized , open-label dose-escalation study weekly carfilzomib dexamethasone ( Cd-qw ) patient progressive multiple myeloma . The Phase 1 dose escalation portion enroll patient sequential dose-escalating cohort consist 3 patient establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) carfilzomib administer weekly 30 minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion dexamethasone . The Phase 2 portion enroll patient use MTD establish carfilzomib Phase 1 portion study . Dexamethasone administer IV PO dose schedule use Phase 1 portion study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Weekly Carfilzomib Combination With Dexamethasone Progressive Multiple Myeloma ( CHAMPION 1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 study patient progressive multiple myeloma design achieve follow : determine MTD carfilzomib dexamethasone administered weekly ( Cd-qw ) 3 consecutive week 28-day cycle determine magnitude response achieve patient treated MTD . The Cd-qw dosing schedule propose protocol may beneficial patient convenience perspective compare twice-weekly dosing schedule , however , clinical benefit safety weekly carfilzomib administration assess multiple myeloma patient , patient progress weekly carfilzomib allow 1 attempt recapture response increase dose frequency twice-weekly carfilzomib dose schedule demonstrate efficacy tolerability . This information valuable assess dose intensity impact suppression multiple myeloma relapse setting . Finally , protocol eliminate requirement fluid administration carfilzomib Cycle 1 reduce time require treat patient clinic . This modification study effect carfilzomib safety profile .</detailed_description>
