	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate effectiveness naturally occur clay substance ( ACCS100 ) reduce harmful effect aflatoxin exposure ( carcinogen ) fumonisin ( cancer promoter ) . This clay substance contain variety mineral include calcium , sodium , potassium , magnesium . UPSN similar aluminosilicate mineral regularly use dietary supplement human animal , safety naturally occur clay substance test clinical trial . The FDA treat mineral nutritional supplement drug test potential lessening likelihood disease ( i.e. , potential mitigating disease ) . This study involve use investigational drug call Hydrated Sodium Calcium Aluminosilicate ( ACCS100 ) . `` Investigational '' mean `` drug '' yet approve U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) reduce harmful effect mycotoxin exposure human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Reduction Dietary Mycotoxin Exposure ACCS100 ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This plan clinical trial comparative study determine safety effectiveness ACCS100 capsule , investigational product , vs. placebo participant reduction dietary mycotoxin exposure . One measure effectiveness analysis Bexar County participant 's AFB1/FB1 metabolite level blood urine sample . Additionally , clinical trial determine adherence dose schedule participant ; determine prevalence mycotoxin exposure screen population residence Bexar County , Texas ; compare side-effects adverse event ACCS100 placebo participant population . These data reveal value mineral enterosorbent strategy improvement public health well-being human risk dietary mycotoxin exposure consequence . The propose indication ACCS100 `` reduction dietary mycotoxin exposure human . '' ACCS100 make Hydrated Sodium Calcium Aluminosilicate ( HSCAS ) , substance generally recognize safe ( GRAS ) FDA previously show significant adverse effect give much 4 gram per day healthy study participant immuno-compromised cancer patient . Rationale Our preliminary study suggest ACCS100 contains low level trace metal dioxin commonly find smectite clay , batch-to-batch QA/QC result material consistent . We anticipate ACCS100 use primary intervention bind AFB1 FB1 decrease external dose toxin diet turn reduce incidence hepatic cancer disease vulnerable community . Using multiple animal model , laboratory show NS clay highly effective prevent adverse effect dietary mycotoxin . Also , Phase I IIa clinical trial Texas Ghana confirm NS safe human consumption significantly reduce exposure AFB1 FB1 ( Wang et al. , 2005 ; Afriyie-Gyawu et al. , 2007 , 2008 ; Wang et al. , 2008 ; Phillips et al. , 2007 ; Jiang et al. , 2008 ; Jolly et al. , 2006 ; Robinson , et al. , 2009 ) . The incidence human HCC show significantly elevate several zip code region Bexar County , Texas . Studies conduct Agency Toxic Substances Disease Registry indicate several zip code region within Bexar County , Texas incidence liver cancer significantly elevate ( ATSDR , 2004 ) . Notably , age-adjusted cancer incidence rate cite Texas Department State Health Services 2002-2006 show Hispanics Bexar Co. increase HCC incidence rate , 16.5 ( 15.0-18.0 ) , compare Hispanics Texas , 10.9 ( 10.4-11.4 ) ; rate per 100,000 , confidence interval 95 % rate . Furthermore , HCC incidence rate Bexar Co. Hispanics considerably high race Bexar Co. , 10.0 ( 9.2-10.8 ) , race Texas , 5.8 ( 5.7-6.0 ) . Hispanic male Bexar County ( compare female ) show high HCC incidence rate time period , 27.1 ( 24.2-30.2 ) versus 8.4 ( 7.0-9.9 ) . Chronic exposure low level AFB1 FB1 contaminate corn peanut , major risk factor development HCC , risk significantly increase exposed individual infect hepatitis virus . An association HCC incidence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection evident many developed country include U.S. , Japan , Egypt , numerous country Europe ( Seeff , 2004 ) . Interestingly , record University Texas M.D . Anderson Cancer Center show 50 % HCC case observe Texas could attribute HCV infection ( Hassan , et al. , 2002 ) . The HCV prevalence Texas report vary 1.25-2.63 % , high concentration southern Texas along Texas-Mexico border ( Yalamanchili , et al. , 2005 ) . Armstrong et al . ( 2000 ) estimate future HCC incidence may rise U.S. due problem chronic hepatitis C. While prevention HCV infection would play major role reduce burden HCC , currently vaccine available HCV . Thus , eliminate AFB1/FB1 exposure individual level ( vulnerable individual ) , may contribute overall reduction HCC risk burden . In recent pilot study , 184 volunteer primarily Hispanic community within three zip code Bexar Co. ( significantly elevate liver cancer incidence rate ) provide blood urine sample hepatitis screen biomarker analyse San Antonio Metropolitan Health District ( SAMHD ) Environmental Health Wellness Center ( Figure 2 ) . Of participant , 7.1 % hepatitis C virus positive , base anti-HCV antibody measurement . To assess short-term AFB1 exposure , urinary aflatoxin M1 ( AFM1 ) level measure use high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection . AFM1 detectable 11.7 % urine sample , average level 223.85 Â± 250.56 ( range 1.89-935.49 ) pg/mg creatinine . Results food frequency questionnaire show 98 % participant report ate fresh corn , can frozen corn , corn tortilla , Mexican food , rice , peanut butter , corn bread , nuts various frequency . A large percentage population ( 44.8 % ) consume corn tortilla frequently ( 3-14 time per week ) , majority ( 57.6 % ) ate 2 tortillas time consumption . The detection urinary AFM1 significantly associate increased consumption tortilla ( p = 0.009 ) , peanut ( p = 0.033 ) rice ( p = 0.037 ) . Findings suggest participant consume high amount foods prone AFB1/FB1 contamination may potentially exposed toxin significant level . Importantly , strategy reduce AFB1/FB1 exposure , especially individual infect hepatitis , may play important role prevention HCC at-risk community Texas . These preliminary study provide groundwork proof concept propose project . Feasible intervention therapy diminish human exposure AFB1/FB1 imperative . In proposal , study provide innovative strategy reduce dietary mycotoxin exposure . Our approach utilize ACCS100 mitigate dietary exposure AFB1 ( cancer initiator ) FB1 ( cancer promoter ) .</detailed_description>
