	<brief_title>Nonintubated Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia Versus Double-lumen Intubated Anesthesia Video-assisted Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The thoracoscopic surgery always require appropriate depth anaesthesia , also quiet wide operative field . That 's anaesthesia play critical role thoracoscopic surgery . General double-lumen endotracheal intubate anesthesia one-lung ventilation , accepted mandatory Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery ( VATS ) although several adverse effect derive type anesthesia like intubation-related throat injury , ventilator-induced lung injury , arrhythmia . The investigator hypothesize VATS could perform no-intubated thoracic epidural anesthesia ( NTEA ) avoid general anesthesia related risk . Some case report prove safety feasibility NTEA uncomplicated VATS . However , comparison NTEA general anesthesia rarely investigated large magnitude number operation variety . The investigator hypothesize NTEA could result less inflammation , low incidence complication , less dosage antibiotic , fast recovery eventually leading short hospital stay . For reason , investigator undertake randomize trial compare result general VATS operation NTEA versus control group operate general anesthesia double-lumen endotracheal intubation . A total 500 patient include . The study perform first affiliated hospital Guangzhou Medical College .</detailed_description>
