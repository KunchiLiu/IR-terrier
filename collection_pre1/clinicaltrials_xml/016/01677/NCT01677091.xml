	<detailed_description>Imbalance particularly severe Cerebral Vascular Accident limit capacity transfer source fall also represent obstacle acquisition autonomy . When brain lesion locate right hemisphere , prognosis term equilibrium bad probably presence disorder spatial cognition . These disorder spatial cognition manifest distortion mental representation space body space probably cause deviation position center pression platform . This component balance disorder secondary disruption spatial cognition , benefit present specific rehabilitative treatment despite severity consequence . But application sensory manipulation proven effectiveness visuospatial neglect another disorder spatial cognition close pathophysiology balance disorder right brain lesion . Sensory manipulation decrease distortion internal representation body space restore symmetry sensory input . Some manipulation ( visual manipulation wear prism proprioceptive manipulation ) also effective immediate correction postural imbalance force platform disorder spatial perception . We therefore believe approach repeat sensory manipulation new promising way research rehabilitative treatment balance disorder secondary disorder spatial cognition . As mechanisms action structure involve proprioceptive vibration neck muscle visual prism adaptation different , believe combination two type sensory manipulation permit obtain great longer lasting effect lonely manipulation . The concomitant evaluation bias postural platform perception body axis allow u assess impact rehabilitation disorder spatial representation well understand mechanism action sensory manipulation . The main objective study test effectiveness rehabilitation program cervical vibration ( V ) / prism adaptation ( P ) patient leave hemiplegia balance end intervention ( day14 ) . Secondary objective test : - The immediate effect ( day 0 ) force platform evaluation balance , - Maintaining gain 3 month 6 month balance , - Effectiveness day 14 negligence - Maintaining gain 3 month 6 month neglect , - Effectiveness day 14 functional ability , - Maintaining gain 3 month 6 month functional ability , - Understanding mechanisms action sensory manipulation assess change perception space , rehabilitation program ( day 14 ) 3 month 6 month . - To evaluate evolution motility , sensitivity spasticity various assessment . During 15 day rehabilitation perform study , upper low limb motor rehabilitation last le one hour half , exclude instrumental technique balance rehabilitation , sensory manipulation , virtual reality , strain-induced therapy . Moreover , ancillary study perform study immediate neurofunctional effect vibratory stimulation , right brain-damaged patient imbalance healthy volunteer , assessment cerebral activation change MRI . The secondary objective ancillary study test neurofunctional effect repeat vibratory stimulation right brain-damaged patient , describe relationship cerebral activation change evolution balance , describe area brain activate vibratory stimulation .</detailed_description>
