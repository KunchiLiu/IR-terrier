	<brief_summary>This study subject adenocarcinoma pancreas . The purpose research study determine safety effectiveness modify Folfirinox radiation therapy treatment adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) pancreas surgery . Screening test do determine subject eligible participation study . If subject eligible participate agree participate begin chemotherapy . After 3 cycle chemotherapy , subject begin chemoradiation . Within 4 8 week complete radiation therapy , subject surgery . There also post-treatment follow-up evaluation . Subjects follow every 3 month 3 year initial registration .</brief_summary>
