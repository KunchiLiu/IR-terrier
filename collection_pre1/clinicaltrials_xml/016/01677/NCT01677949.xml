	<brief_summary>Study Design : This two-stage Phase II trial investigate efficacy Clofarabine , Cyclophosphamide Etoposide acute leukemia patient detectable minimal residual disease ( MRD ) prior allo-HCT . The primary objective determine impact study treatment eliminate presence minimal residual disease without cause significant delay allo-HCT due treatment related toxicity . The intent study allow patient proceed transplant ( independent study ) within 42 day Day 1 Clofarabine base therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients stratify time enrollment base diagnosis ( ALL versus AML ) . Based two-stage optimal design , maximum 49 patient ALL maximum 49 patient AML need . For disease cohort , 21 patient enrol stage 1 . If end stage 1 , criterion meet activate stage 2 ( base success clear MRD , proceed transplant within 42 day without excessive toxicity ) one group , stage 2 activate additional 28 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
