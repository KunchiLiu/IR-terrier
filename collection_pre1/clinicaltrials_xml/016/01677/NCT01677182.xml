This study plan conduct one unblinded interim analysis first 276 subject enrol treated 6-week double-blind treatment period . Based interim analysis , study plan adapt limited aspect design include : 1 ) make change study ; 2 ) reassess sample size base interim analysis result . This multi-centre trial conduct North America Europe . The overall time participate study 14 week . Participants make 8 visit clinic , contact telephone 30 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) recently perform planned interim analysis efficacy safety data study . Upon completion review , DMC advise unblinded interim data meet predefined efficacy criterion study termination . No safety concern identify .</detailed_description>
