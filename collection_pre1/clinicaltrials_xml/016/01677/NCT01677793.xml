	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) premier modality investigate structure function human brain . In study child adolescent , noninvasiveness MRI make especially applicable . Developmental trajectory gray matter volume cortical thickness well studied western country . However , significant variability brain structure report Chinese Caucasian , variation may also exist developmental trajectory brain . However , maturation process neural fiber tract white matter less understood . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , frequently use investigate integrity fibertracts literature , limited deal cross fiber . Diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) newly develop technique improve resolution cross fiber , suitable detailed tractography assessment . In addition establish template brain structure ( T1 T2 ) structural connectivity child , adolescent , young adult population , study follow three aim . 1 . To describe gender effect developmental change brain volume different cortical subcortical region , thickness cortex brain , structural connectivity ( e.g. , frono-striatal , fronto-pareital , fronto-temporal fronto-cerebeller tract superior longitudinal fasciculus II ) across childhood adolescent adulthood ; 2 . To examine gender effect developmental change attention , executive function visual memory childhood adulthood whether gender moderate developmental change ; 3 . To correlate structural connectivity brain size neuropsychological function within subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit 140 healthy volunteer ( 70 male 70 female ) , age 8-21 without current past history psychiatric disorder autistic symptom . All participant receive psychiatric interview ( K-SADS-E/SADS ) complete Chinese AQ SRS screen psychiatric disorder autistic symptom . They receive WAIS-III WISC-III ( depend age ) first ensure full-scale IQ great 80 , follow CPT CANTAB wide range assessment attention , executive function , memory . The MRI assessment ( T1 T2 imaging , DSI , resting-state fMRI ) subsequently arrange within 2 week psychiatric/neuropsychological assessment . The investigator anticipate study ( 1 ) establish first template brain anatomy structural connectivity child adolescent population , ( 2 ) first report developmental trajectory brain Chinese brain gross anatomy tractography ; ( 3 ) provide evidence development brain structure associate maturation cognitive function .</detailed_description>
