	<brief_summary>Children adolescent ADHD impulsive difficulty regulate behavior . It suggest core deficit inhibitory control may account dysfunctional behavior associate disorder . Previous research show medication self-regulation strategy make implementation intention ( i.e. , if-then plan ) effective enhance child 's inhibitory control , reflect behavioral well electrophysiological ( e.g. , Electroencephalogram ; EEG ) data Go/NoGo task child ADHD . As suggest earlier research , however , form implementation intention may different effect people embed different culture . The aim present study compare effect medication self-regulation forming implementation intention assess behavioral performance correspond brain activity Go/NoGo task child adolescent without ADHD two different cultural context . Further , study also aim investigate potential moderating effect culture make if-then plan . More important , know , first study compare effectiveness form implementation intention child adolescent ADHD cross-cultural way , meaningful researcher explore degree application expect provide clinical psychologist alternative perspective ADHD treatment near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Executive Functions Self-Regulation Among Children With Without ADHD Germany Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For deep understanding mechanism underlying effect MPH implementation intention , neurophysiological data ( special interest P300 component ) Go/NoGo task assess additionally behavioral performance ( i.e. , response time error rate ) . Meanwhile , information may contribute good understand potential influence culture effect implementation intention . The effect may equally effective culture , underlie process might still differ . On hand , difference two cultural group might explain different neurophysiological activity task . Two primary research question arise : ( 1 ) Are MPH implementation intention ( i.e. , if-then plan ) effective enhance performance executive function task measure Go/NoGo task child adolescents ADHD compare without ADHD within culture ? ( 2 ) Does culture play role moderate effect implementation intention executive function task child adolescent ADHD , respectively ? Based research question , two hypothesis formulate . First , treatment MPH self-regulation strategy form implementation intention , would result less inhibition error increase amplitude NoGo P300 NoGominusGo P300 child adolescent ADHD . Second , participant ADHD Taiwan may benefit self-regulation strategy , reflect increased amplitude NoGo P300 NoGominusGo P300 find counterpart Germany . However , since first study compare effect form implementation intention cross-cultural way , latter analysis exploratory .</detailed_description>
