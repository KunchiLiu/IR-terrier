	<detailed_description>Establish international registry AOCID 400 patient deep infection involve bone and/or joint ≥ 20 center represent region world vary hospital surgeon practice setting ensure registry analysis research reflect typical clinical practice thereby provide optimal guidance patient , clinician , healthcare researcher . Creation AOCID Registry musculoskeletal infection case permit good analysis cause , contribute factor include patient immune response , treatment clinical outcome musculoskeletal infection . - Establish practice network include ≥ 20 geographically distributed center . These busy practice treat patient vary geographic status assure balance representation diverse patient practice . - Establish Data Coordinating Core team AOCID use data collection platform minimize entry burden , collect information time surgery , use Internet technology minimize data entry . The registry include : - baseline patient attribute - surgical approach , implant technology - hospital course - surgeon institutional characteristic - longitudinal patient outcome - post-procedure complication revision - serum/tissue/drainage sample - Establish Statistical Support team AOCID implement cutting-edge statistical technique include use hierarchical generalize linear latent mixed effect model address complex structure longitudinal nature registry data . Multivariable predictive model outcome ( ) infection develop . - Establish Outcomes Measurement Team AOCID Investigators CPP team advance science infection-specific global patient-reported outcome support efficient data collection web-based , longitudinal data registry future comparative effectiveness research . - Develop new assessment tool conduct research useful clinical practice . Establish consensus definition treatment failure- characterized lack clinically meaningful improvement infection , pain physical function follow treatment , validate , refine prediction algorithm patient risk failure .</detailed_description>
