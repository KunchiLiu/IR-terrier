	<brief_title>The Assessment Treatment Balance Impairment Using Virtual Reality ( VR ) Panic Disorder Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Anxiety disorder group ailment , characterize excessive abnormal vague sens apprehension follow stress restlessness ( Berrios 1999 ) . As group , anxiety disorder find high lifetime prevalence , i.e . commonly occur class mental disorder ( Kessler et al . 2010 ) 17.7 % prevalence year ( Kessler et al . 2005 ) . This group disorder consist five main mental disorder : specific phobia , obsessive-compulsive , post-traumatic stress , generalize anxiety panic disorder - investigator focus . Panic disorder ( PD ) chronic ailment characterize spontaneous , unexpected occurrence panic attack , i.e . period intense fear , vary dramatically recurrence panic attack patient within patient , range per day per year ( American Psychiatric Association 2000 ) . PD often occur conjunction agoraphobia , i.e . fear avoidance situation setting perceive little control , public place 'suffocating ' surroundings ( Kessler et al . 2005 ) . PD reach lifetime prevalence 5 % ( Kessler et al . 2010 ) ( Serretti et al . 2011 ) woman two three time likely affect men ( Schumacher et al . 2011 ) . PD mostly develop young adulthood ( 25y mean age ) , however mandatory onset childhood early adolescence likely remain undiagnosed ( Schumacher et al . 2011 ) . Individuals suffer PD also say deregulated autonomic nervous system rest orthostatic challenge ( i.e . tilt test ) , display heighten heart rate diastolic blood pressure compare healthy control ( Martinez et al . 2010 ) . Many year research invest seek association anxiety PD impair physical balance ( Perna et al . 2001 ; Sklare et al . 2001 ; Staab Ruckenstein 2003 ; Staab 2006 ; Redfern et al . 2007 ) . Many time treatment anxiety disorder general , PD among , target limbic area , fail succeed ; thus recommend treat comorbid balance impairment , treatment alone ameliorate anxiety ( Shefer et al . 2010 ) . Literature subject indicated high prevalence comorbid balance disorder anxiety general ( Alvord 1991 ; Balaban Jacob 2001 ; Kalueff et al . 2008 ) well anxiety disorder specific range agoraphobia , panic attack generalize anxiety ( Alvord 1991 ; Balaban Jacob 2001 ; Balaban Thayer 2001 ; Jacob Furman 2001 ) . Anxiety general PDs common co-morbidity acute chronic vestibular disorder ( Eagger et al . 1992 ; Matheson et al . 1999 ; Jacob Furman 2001 ; Pollak et al . 2003 ) , evolve vestibular deficiency sensorimotor disintegration . In spite abundant literature support anxiety-imbalance relationship , still uncertain whether causality relate . Further investigation subject reveal individual suffer PD may also display alter cognitive pattern ( Casey et al . 2004 ; Starcevic Berle 2006 ) . In addition , last decade research cognitive field dedicate evaluate cerebellar involvement ( Andreasen Pierson 2008 ) . Studies animal model ( Brodal et al . 1991 ; Dum Strick 2003 ; Kelly Strick 2003 ) show cerebellar connection frontal cortex pons thalamus , suggest participation neural circuit mediate higher cognitive function . While cerebellar lesion animal indicate motor coordination motor learn impairment ( Thach 1996 ; Bastian et al . 1998 ) , study human assign cerebellum role time interval perception ( Akshoomoff Courchesne 1992 ) , rhythm sequence imitation ( Fiez et al . 1995 ) associative learn ( Attwell et al . 2002 ) . Hence , cerebellum seem act modulator cognitive process perform cerebral cortex , detect pattern pattern change well error motor cognitive function feedback cerebrum ( Andreasen Pierson 2008 ) . Further support association lie theory learn . Erez et al . ( Erez et al . 2004 ) present three-stage learning theory , include acquisition stage two distinct stage condition response ( CR ) : emotional CR , driven autonomic hormonal system , fast non-specific motor CR , provide effective CR slow specific . Despite apparent difference , two stage seem highly interrelate explain frighten stimulus : fear CRs acquire , emotional fear CRs take promote motor CRs . Contrariwise fear CRs may take , subclinical balance disorder exists , could postulate intervention balance may reduce PD . Balance maintenance occur automatically involved execution basic motion , enable daily life activity ( Keshner 1994 ; Kurtzer et al . 2005 ) well high performance skill ballet ( Koutedakis Jamurtas 2004 ) athletics ( Hrysomallis 2011 ) . Normally , balance task become automatic , voluntary cognitive action enable without trade-off ( Adi-Japha et al 2008 ) . The success perform motor task lie ability conduct task-related voluntary movement top constant involuntary postural adjustment ( Keshner 1994 ; Kurtzer et al . 2005 ) . Thus , task-related maneuver involve contraction muscle limbs trunk maintenance body stability . Balance maintenance also require constant integration sensory input come vestibular , visual , somatosensory ( mainly proprioceptive ) channel motor system ( Shefer et al . 2010 ) . Converging different sensory source , system address various balance maintenance aspect ( Massion Woollacott 1996 ) loss sensory input either one result alteration posture ( Le Kapoula 2008 ) . Impaired vestibular function cause imbalance , nausea , vertigo abnormal eye movement ( Gilman Newman 1996 ) hinders acquisition emission corrective movement . Such occasion associate limbic-related anxiety , perhaps parabrachial circuit ( Balaban Thayer 2001 ) . The parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) reciprocally connect spinal cord , hypothalamus , amygdala limbic cortex , thus receive vestibular nuclear visceral afferent information ; therefore link vestibulo-visceral integration especially adjustment gravito-inertial challenge . In recent study evaluate vestibular mutation mouse , find elevate plus-maze platform open-field test contribute greatly anxiety level ( Shefer et al . 2010 ) . While rotation , extra-cellular recording give support vestibulo-recipient area PBN integrate signal vestibular nuclei convey information whole-body 's orientation pathways produce homeostatic affective response ( Balaban et al . 2002 ) ; give support panic impair balance co-morbidity . Individuals suffer vestibular balance disorder many time demonstrate symptom anxiety , conversely , patient anxiety disorder often show abnormality clinical balance vestibular function test ( Bronstein et al . 2004 ; Furman et al . 2005 ) . Perna et al . ( Perna et al . 2001 ) show PD patient demonstrate large velocity length body sway comparison healthy control . An additional study measure postural sway anxiety patient response move visual environment find great sway among anxiety group compare healthy control ( Redfern et al . 2007 ) . A Parkinson 's disease study show case suffer specific vestibular disease , subclinical abnormality balance system . These patient control posture rely non-vestibular cue , proprioceptive mostly visual input ( Staab 2006 ; Caldirola et al . 2011 ) . Despite considerable evidence literature , still difficult isolate verify balance impairment PD . Thus investigator propose implementation virtual reality exposure therapy . The term virtual reality ( VR ) refers use interactive computerize environment ( software hardware ) simulate real world setting , enable immersion individual trial ( Weiss et al . 2005 ) . With high sensitivity , possible create environment individual gradually lead motivate challenge environment , require his/ alertness physical attendance rather imaginational capability . Within VR possible design set consist motivational challenging element , indicate individual regard his/ capability competence ( contrast his/ impotence passiveness ) amend experience ( triumph achieve ) . In addition , therapist unique opportunity part environment real-time straightforward . VR expose examinee well therapist salient component panic evoke situation visual , auditory motor element stress environment reconstruct reveals panic-provoking root ( Roy et al . 2010 ) . VR exposure enable identification intimidate moment well confident one , provide examinee compete instrument deal stress moment , allow environment change adjust exposure level challenge examinee ( Wiederhold Wiederhold 2010 ) . VR exposure do laboratory condition full supervision , thus address individual physically incapable outdoors train well . All , utilization VR method allow employment stepwise exposure approach , make computerized human fine-tuned modification scene ( Wiederhold Wiederhold 2010 ) . Furthermore , VR exposure therapy , practice twenty year , support learn train neuro-motor task flight , ski surgery simulator . During last year , VR exposure method make way clinical utilization rehabilitation center hospital , balance motor control main focus ( Roy et al . 2010 ) . The exposure VR may contribute several aspect , reach conventional therapy method . VR exposure therapy provide innovative exceptional opportunity reconstruct scene setting , lead panic behavior , expose examinee critical factor consist panic root . Altogether , VR system enable learning simple complex skill control environment , due endowment monitor , grade , adapt exposure various component construct therapy systematic manner ( Rizzo et al . 1997a ; Rizzo et al . 1997b ; Schultheis Rizzo 2001 ; Merians et al . 2002 ; Deutsch et al . 2004 ; Weiss et al . 2005 ) . Using VR , balance performance evaluate precisely efficiently measure body sway quiet stand set perturbation ( Nashner 1976 ; Allum Carpenter 2005 ) . The measured factor displacement center pressure ( CoP ) , i.e . point counter-reaction force vector vertical ground apply . This force vector represent weighted average pressure vector foot force plate ( Winter et al . 1990 ; Winter 1995 ) . The CoP dynamic factor displaces centimeter within plane constantly ( Winter 1995 ; Winter et al . 1996 ) . Body sway kinematic term often estimate CoP displacement ( anterior-posterior medio-lateral ax ) derive force plate data , assume synonymous CoP measure ( Winter et al . 1998 ) . Balance maintenance postural adjustment modify repeat experience improve practice ( Pollock et al . 2000 ) , less muscle recruit response refine become subtle ( Horak Nashner 1986 ; Horak et al . 1989 ; Chong et al . 1999 ) . Besides physical condition , balance maintenance depend also cognitive aspect attention , memory dual tasking . Plotnik et al . ( Plotnik et al . 2011 ) show relationship dual tasking ability fall risk patient suffer Parkinson 's disease , suggest Parkinsonian faller easily affect dual tasking , great likelihood loss balance execution daily attention-drawing activity . Thus , motor skill range form simple complex one perform monitored characterization learning process ; train virtual environment provide opportunity study learn skill build learn curve ( Holden 2005 ; Carelli et al . 2009 ) . During VR , complete movement sequence record pattern allow full investigation motor skill , important accordance notion motor skill learn task specific ( Karni et al . 1998 ; Korman et al . 2007 ) . Many research recognize potential use VR clinical treatment psychopathology , especially anxiety field . Some evidence application VR exposure therapy treatment specific phobia PD recently find literature ( Botella et al . 2004 ; Pull Damsa 2008 ; de Carvalho et al . 2010 ; Gerardi et al . 2010 ; Meyerbroker Emmelkamp 2010 ; Perez-Ara et al . 2010 ; Meyerbroker et al . 2011 ) . A Belgian research study motor vehicle accident trauma examinee show use VR efficient method treat phobias VR exposure provide safe control therapeutic environment unrelated treatment circumstance ( Wiederhold Wiederhold 2010 ) . Therefore , VR exposure apply interactively , since value exposure examinee active environment dynamic challenging ; exposure nature enhance alertness emotional excitement , valuable treatment 's success . The investigator examine prevalence severity PD patient take consideration high prevalence balance impairment . The implementation VR method involve research development cost well maintenance one , sometimes technical impediment may take place due rely advanced multisensory method . VR method call recruitment technician beyond professional therapist , thoroughly train operate large number software test-runs ( pilot ) introduce patient . The common belief multisensory exposure , trigger several system time distract examinee 's mind prevent him/ fully immerse ( Roy et al . 2010 ) refute . In Sheba Rehabilitation Center Advanced Technologies VR laboratory run year , enable rapid successful rehabilitation many patient . Salient relevant specification VR laboratory adjust treatment balance disorder panic . The investigator intend implement VR method treatment balance disorder patient , investigate role ameliorate panic behavior . The investigator hypothesize VR treatment aid patient challenge situation improve neuro-motor function thus well management everyday experience . Objectives Stage 1 ( evaluation ) - investigate whether balance impairment within PD patient comparison match healthy subject . Stage 2 ( treatment ) - investigate whether balance training use VR exposure therapy significantly effective reduce panic symptom , exposure still picture scene without balance challenge , CBT standard protocol treatment PD .
