	<brief_summary>The main purpose study examine safety study drug patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The study team would like know side effect patient may give study drug . Another goal study determine combine dendritic cell study drug possibly use vaccine disease . Dendritic cell cell present body 's immune system help body fight disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Each follow criterion must meet order patient consider eligible enrollment . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma locally advance unresectable . Patients endocrine neuroendocrine tumor , lymphoma pancreas , ampullary cancer eligible . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . One tumor measurable CT scan per RECIST 1.1 . ( Eisenhauer ) Patients may prior cancer therapy . Patients need demonstrate progression consider trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 . Age ≥ 18 year . Patient must expect life expectancy great 3 month . Signed , write IRBapproved informed consent . Bilirubin ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( CTCAE Grade 2 baseline ) AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 XULN ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Acceptable hematologic status , define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000 ( plt/mm3 ) , ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL . Urinalysis clinically significant abnormality . PT PTT ≤ 1.5 X ULN correction nutritional deficiency may contribute prolonged PT/PTT Each follow criterion present order patient consider eligible enrollment . Patients must metastatic disease . Patients evidence metastatic disease time screen prior administration DC vaccination consider screen failure exclude study . Prior surgery allow provide least 14 day elapse surgery registration . Prior radiation/chemo allow provide least 28 day elapse since last treatment . Patients must serious uncontrolled acute chronic medical condition would interfere treatment . Examples would include active acute chronic infection require antibiotic , uncontrolled cardiovascular , endocrine , infectious disease . Patient must clinically significant ascites . Patients must significant ongoing cardiac problem , myocardial infarction within last six month , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , uncontrolled arrhythmia congestive heart failure . Patients know brain metastasis eligible . However , brainimaging study require eligibility patient neurologic sign symptom . If brainimaging study perform , must negative disease . Patients must plan receive concurrent chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy type therapy treatment cancer protocol treatment . Due undetermined effect treatment regimen patient HIV1 infection potential serious interaction antiHIV medication , patient know infected HIV eligible study . Due possibility harm fetus nursing infant treatment regimen , patient must pregnant nursing . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test complete study screen . Women men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient disease free five year .</criteria>
