	<brief_title>Coupling Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With Neuronavigation System Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) new tool major depressive disorder . rTMS non invasive technique allow localized stimulation cerebral tissue cortex . rTMS use electromagnetic induction induce weak electric current use rapidly change magnetic field ; modify activity specific general part brain . Meta-analyses state rTMS appear effective treatment major depression despite limit concern sample size methodological concern . Studies show technique potentiate antidepressant treatment combination therapy . It receive FDA approval management major depressive disorder . Stimulation parameter numerous ( frequency , intensity , number pulse ) effect increasingly well understood order predict well balance efficacy tolerability . The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) target repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation standard ( manual ) ' 5-cm method ' position transcranial magnetic stimulation coil DLPFC reference . It criticize due poor target accuracy attribute inter-subject variability . Such inaccuracy could consequences decrease rTMS efficacy . Any preliminary finding suggest reproductible accurate method , base upon neuronavigation system could allow good efficacy . This finding replicate sound methodology . Objectives : To compare efficacy mood coil position base upon neuronavigation device versus coil positioning base upon standard method . Investigators hypothesize accurate localization stimulation DLPFC use neuronavigation would effective less accurate standard method . A secondary objective compare efficacy patient 's self perception , psychomotor symptom tolerability two method .</detailed_description>
