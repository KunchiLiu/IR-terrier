	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare regularly eat ( dry ) bean peas rice ( control ) lower blood lipid , particularly Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol total cholesterol , mildly hypercholesterolemic men woman . The investigator hypothesize regularly eating bean peas significantly improve blood lipid profile people . Participants study consume 1 study food item 5 7 day week contain bean peas rice total 6 week . This study benefit Canadian pulse grower enhance development food product human consumption support marketing strategy increase awareness diet rich pulse improve human health . Measuring change blood urinary polyphenol level help verify whether compound play role beneficial action bean peas subsequently assist identification beneficial bean/pea component . This turn , enable crop breeder select plant rich compound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The aim study conduct multi-centre randomized , control trial specifically compare biological effectiveness bean versus pea vs rice ( control ) LDL-cholesterol mildly hypercholesterolemic men woman . In addition , effect bean peas key factor associate cardiovascular disease , include triglyceride , High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol , body weight/fatness , glucose , insulin , glycated hemoglobin biomarkers vascular function . Inflammation metabolism investigate , well participant ' assessment study food acceptability , satiety gastrointestinal response . BACKGROUND : Pulses ( bean , pea , lentil chickpea ) healthy food contain twice amount protein cereal , high fibre , key vitamin mineral like folate iron low fat . Canada world 's large producer exporter lentils pea , Alberta produce 34 % pea crop 12 % bean 2010 . Current consumption pulse Canada low , due lack pulse-based convenient food product . An approved health claim drive interest development food product particular ingredient see oat beta-glucan . Experts agree exist evidence cholesterol-lowering effect pulse particularly strong bean , study need show effect peas , lentil chickpeas comparable bean . Results study used substantiate health claim bean pulse crop future , similar health claim exist beta-glucan plant sterol . METHODS AND PROCEDURES : This multi-center study compare effect bean ( pinto , black , Great Northern , small red ) versus pea ( yellow , green ) control ( rice-based ) food total Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol mildly hypercholesterolemic ( &gt; 3 mmol/L &lt; 5mmol/L ; medication ) adult . There 3 study arm : ) bean , ii ) pea , iii ) rice ( control ) . The study group ask consume food item contain 120 gram cook bean cook peas daily 6 week . The control group ask consume one 1/2 cup serve per day rice-based food matrix similar contain bean peas 6 week . The study control food incorporate participant normal dietary pattern . All food item provide participant free charge . Food item , generally form soup stew , develop collaborator Food Science University Manitoba initial phase project . The investigator plan recruit approximately 180 participant ( n= 75 participant University Manitoba n= 105 University Alberta ) . Interested individual ( potential participant ) first ask attend screen visit . The screen visit procedure discuss prior screen visit , include need fast ( i.e. , food beverage intake except water 12 hour ) blood sample determine Low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol triglyceride level within acceptable range . Once visit , individual provide description study investigate team 's study coordinator . The eligibility criterion review candidate investigate team 's study coordinator ass suitability study . Individuals meet inclusion/exclusion criterion contact study coordinator information . All individual screen contact study coordinator eligibility confirm . An appointment baseline assessment meeting schedule eligible confirm interest study ; eligible eligible long wish participate thank time . At baseline assessment visit individual remind study description ask provide write informed consent time . Once enrol , participant undergo complete medical history include age , sex , alcohol use , exercise habit , current medical problem , medication family history previous event stroke diabetes . A fasting blood sample obtain assess plasma lipid profile . Participants ask attend 4 in-person clinic visit duration study screening , baseline assessment , 3 6 week ( end study ) . Once identify give informed consent , participant randomize one 3 study arm . The randomization either computer generate , do manually study coordinator site . Each participant give randomized number , use study documentation . Participants fill questionnaire relate demographic , lifestyle , food intake , gastrointestinal response etc . The baseline visit include height weight measurement , waist circumference body composition use Bod Pod machine ( air displacement ) Blood pressure record . Participants assess change medication profile discuss current medical condition . The three day food record ( complete home ) collect . Urine sample fast blood sample drawn lipid assessment profile , insulin , glucose , glycated hemoglobin , polyphenols biomarkers vascular function , inflammation metabolism . Blood require exceed 60mL . Randomization do baseline visit . Prior leave , participant provide first 3-week supply assign food instruction prepare consume , remind fast next visit . This visit take approximately 2.5 hour . Week 3 visit include height weight measurement , waist circumference body composition use Bod Pod ( via air displacement ) . Blood pressure record . Participants assess change medication profile current medical condition . The 3 day food record ( complete home ) collect . Urine sample collect . Fasting blood sample drawn assessment lipid profile , insulin , glucose , glycated hemoglobin , polyphenols biomarkers vascular function , inflammation metabolism . The total blood require exceed 60mL . Participants complete questionnaire ass compliance , acceptability study food , satiety , GI responses adverse event . Questions address . Before leave , participant provide second 3-week supply assign food , instruction prepare consume . Participants remind fast prior next visit . Visit take approximately 2 hour . Week 6 visit : Measurements take height weight , waist circumference , body composition use Bod Pod ( air displacement ) blood pressure repeat . Participants assess change medication profile current medical condition . Urine sample collect polyphenols . A fasting blood sample drawn assessment lipid profile , insulin , glucose , glycated hemoglobin , polyphenols , biomarkers vascular function ( University Manitoba ) , inflammation metabolism . Total blood exceed 60 mL . Participants complete questionnaire ass compliance , acceptability food , satiety , Gastrointestinal responses adverse event . Total time require , approximately 2.5 hour . Completion visit mark end study . Participants pay , thanked time .</detailed_description>

Fasting triglyceride &lt; 4.00 mmol/L ; Low enough dangerous participant , high enough see lower effect . Stable body weight ( Â±5 % ) past 3 month BMI 2040 ; Participants high BMI likely high lipid level , important stable body weight energy requirement drastically change study period . Must stable regime past 3 month take medication take vitamin mineral/dietary/herbal supplement ; Stable regime reduces risk change study . Able read , write communicate orally English ; All questionnaires communication complete English . Willing comply protocol requirement , include stable level physical activity study pulsecontaining food consume study ; ensure valid result . Willing provide inform consent . Regular high pulse consumption ( &gt; 2 serving per week ) ; Any additional pulse consumption affect outcome study . Use medication lower blood lipid low blood glucose ; aim study prove cholesterol lower capability bean pea , method blood lipid lower skew data . Use nonprescription product design low blood lipid ( e.g . margarine yogurt add plant sterol ) within past 3 month ; see Medical history liver disease , renal insufficiency , inflammatory bowel disease gastrointestinal disorder influence gastrointestinal motility nutrient absorption ; decrease effectiveness bean/ consumption . Any active medical surgical condition ( ) within past 3 month preclude study participation ; participant must stable condition recovery pending surgery . Conditions medication likely increase risk participant study personnel , reduce ability participant comply protocol , affect result ; History gastrointestinal reaction allergy bean , pea ricebased food , one ingredient study food significantly limit number study food consume . Currently participate participate food intervention study within last 3 month .</criteria>
