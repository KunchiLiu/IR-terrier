	<brief_summary>Problem : Precise personalize 3D knee kinematic assessment physical daily life activity challenge ; therefore , never perform important number individual . However , good understand 3D knee kinematics activity would allow good understand often injure joint . Hypothesis : A new system use personalized 3D bone image percutaneous bone fixation device use local anesthesiaallows precise reproducible assessment 3D knee kinematics physical daily life activity . Objectives : - To study human knee 3D kinematics dynamic activity use novel minimally invasive measuring system - Investigate correlation standard clinical knee laxity test measure 3D knee kinematics dynamic activity</brief_summary>
