	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether take either two low dose drug would prevent new blood vessel grow stem cell transplant feasible , side effect take drug autologous transplant might . The reason investigator look drug one thing allow tumor grow quickly ability stimulate growth new blood vessel . By suppress growth new blood vessel stem cell transplant , investigator hope prevent tumor come back continue grow .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must original diagnosis , benefit autologous transplantation , confirm biopsy* highgrade glial tumor , lowgrade glial tumor , ependymoma , medulloblastoma , primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , Wilms ' tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma , retinoblastoma , miscellaneous poorprognosis solid tumor . Lymphomas lymphoid malignancy study protocol . * Brain stem glioma patient progress radiation therapy require histologic confirmation . Brain stem glioma define intrinsic tumor pons cause diffuse enlargement . These patient diagnose clinical radiographic appearance lesion biopsy requirement waive group . Patient must ≥ 6 month age ≤ 21 year age time study entry . Patient must Karnofsky performance status Lansky* play status ≥ 50 * For purpose determine performance score , wheelchairbound patient consider ambulatory . Patient must adequate supply stem cell transplant harvest prior study enrollment , adequate supply define 3 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) . Cell mobilization method leave treat physician 's discretion may include mobilization growth factor alone mobilization chemotherapy . If patient unable mobilize proper amount peripheral stem cell , bone marrow may harvest source hematopoietic stem cell . In instance , 3 x 108 mononuclear cells/kg consider adequate . If necessary , combination peripheral stem cell bone marrow use . Prior radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy , include cyclophosphamide , permit . Prior antiangiogenic therapy , include thalidomide oral cyclophosphamide , permit . If corticosteroids mass effect and/or edema related tumor , patient must stable decrease dose least 2 week prior study entry . Patient must life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patient must adequate bone marrow reserve define : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 750/mm3 Patient must adequate cardiac function test within 4 week study enrollment define : Shortening fraction ≥ 27 % echocardiogram Ejection fraction ≥ 50 % radionuclide angiogram Patient must adequate pulmonary function test within 4 week study enrollment define : Pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % room air O2 nasal cannula No evidence dyspnea rest . Patient must adequate hepatic function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( SGOT ≤ 4x ULN Zantac ) Patient must adequate renal function define : Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , calculate via I125 iothalamate clearance , 24hour creatinine clearance , Schwartz formula* , ≥ 70 mL/min ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 do within 4 week study entry The Schwartz formula estimate glomerular filtration rate child base upon serum creatinine height . Height ( Ht ) measure cm serum creatinine ( Cr ) mg/dL . Proportionality constant ( k ) 0.55 child adolescent girl 0.7 adolescent boy age 1321 . This constant base upon series evaluation perform Schwartz . Formula : GFR= ( k x Ht ) /Cr If female childbearing potential ( defined menstruate amenorrheic previous medical treatment ) , follow guideline must adhere : If enrol Arm III study , patient must register Celgene S.T.E.P.S . ® Program . If enrol Arm III study , patient must willing practice birth control outline S.T.E.P.S . Program begin study least 4 week follow discontinuation thalidomide therapy . Two reliable form contraception must use simultaneously unless continuous abstinence heterosexual sexual contact choose . Contraceptive method must include least one highly effective method ( e.g . oral contraceptive pill , injection , hormonal patch , IUD , implant ) , AND one additional effective barrier method ( e.g . latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) . If hormonal IUD contraception medically contraindicate , another highly effective method two barrier method must use time . Pregnancy surveillance : Patient must negative office pregnancy test sensitive within 50 mIU/mL ( serum urine ) within 24 hour begin thalidomide even continuous abstinence prefer method birth control . A pregnancy test must perform weekly first 4 week therapy repeat monthly patient regular menses every 2 week patient irregular menses Negative pregnancy test valid 7 day . If irregular bleeding skip menses , pregnancy test perform pregnancy counsel give . If pregnancy occur treatment , thalidomide must immediately discontinue . Any suspect lethal exposure must report immediately Celgene Customer Care Center 18884235346 , patient refer OB/GYN experience reproductive toxicity evaluation counseling .
