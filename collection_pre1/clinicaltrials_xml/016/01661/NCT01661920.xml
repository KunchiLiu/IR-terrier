	<brief_summary>The duration antibiotic treatment community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) last 9-10 day , determine empirically . The last North American guideline CAP recommend use clinical stability criterion reference establish duration antibiotic treatment , would result 5 day antibiotic use majority pneumonia case . In order validate proposal propose carry randomize multicenter double-blind ( 5th day ) clinical trial adult CAP patient admit 4 hospital Euskadi . A control group ( routine treatment ) compare intervention group ( antibiotic treatment least 5 day , interrupted temperature = &lt; 37,8ºC least 48 hour one sign clinical instability assess ) , regard : mortality 15 day , clinical recovery day 10 30 , clinical improvement day 5 10 evaluated PRO scale , duration antibiotic treatment . A non-inferiority dichotomous sequential analysis perform ( mortality 15 day , clinical recovery day 10 follow-up 30 day , clinical improvement day 5 10 , PRO scale ) well superiority analysis duration antibiotic treatment . A total 1100 patient recruit , follow sign consent , inclusion period ( 18 month ) . Stability criterion measure daily . The rest variable measure admission telephone day 10 30 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Work hypothesis : We aim carry comparative study 2 group patient ( control group , guideline group ) : control group standard duration antibiotic treatment apply ; guideline group ( intervention group ) duration antibiotic treatment base upon IDSA/ATS 2007 provision ( ref . 18 ) , related time need reach clinical stability . 1 . - Patients follow treatment protocol so-called control group , routine treatment , comparison clinical guideline group , show similar result ( sequential dichotomous non-inferiority analysis ) follow clinical parameter : A . Adverse result : 1st , mortality cause within first 15 day admission ; 2nd , development ( major minor ) complication first 15 day admission ; B . Beneficial result : 1st , clinical recovery 10th day treatment follow-up 30 day ; 2nd , clinical improvement 5th 10th day treatment , evaluate PRO scale . 2 . - Patients follow treatment protocol so-called guideline group ( intervention group ) , comparison control group , routine treatment , show good result ( superiority analysis ) follow parameter : c. Duration antibiotic treatment measure use 2 variable : 1.- `` duration antibiotic treatment '' admission , express day ; 2.- `` antibiotic-free day '' , define period least 24 hour antibiotic give 30 day period admission . Goals : To validate recommendation late IDSA/ATS clinical guideline duration antibiotic treatment pneumonia . Main goal . To compare two treatment routine ( control group routine treatment vs clinical guideline group ) base result follow clinical parameter : A . Adverse result : 1st , mortality cause within first 15 day admission ; 2nd , development ( major minor ) complication first 15 day admission ; B . Beneficial result : 1st , clinical recovery 10th day treatment follow-up 30 day ; 2nd , clinical improvement 5th 10th day treatment , evaluate PRO scale . 2.- Patients follow treatment schema so-called guideline group ( intervention group ) , comparison control group , routine treatment , show good result ( superiority analysis ) follow parameter : c. Duration antibiotic treatment measure use 2 variable : 1.- `` duration antibiotic treatment '' admission , express day ; 2.- `` antibiotic-free day '' , define period least 24 hour antibiotic give 30 day period admission . Secondary goal : To compare control group routine treatment vs clinical guideline group base follow parameter : 1 . In-hospital mortality cause . Mortality within 30 day admission , whether relate unrelated pneumonia . 2 . Readmission within 30 day admission reason relate unrelated pneumonia . 3 . Duration hospital stay . 4 . Days return normal activity . 5 . Recurrence initial infection superinfection need additional alternative antibiotic , within 30 day admission . Study design - Population study . Inclusion/exclusion criterion - Main secondary variable - Data analysis - Ethical legal aspect ( BCP compliance , insurance… ) - Aspects relate research medication ( manufacturing , labeling , distribution… ) - Funding source medication Randomized multicenter double-blind ( 5th day ) clinical trial involve adult PAC patient ( ≥18 year age ) admit 4 teach hospital Euskadi . All CAP patient hospitalize within period 18 month ( October-April ) evaluate eligibility . The study involve intervention undertaken 2 parallel group , duration antibiotic treatment follow routine clinical practice ( control group ) compare duration IDSA/ATS provision CAP ( ref . 18 ) ( `` clinical guideline '' group ) . Patients randomly assign control group `` clinical guideline '' group third day hospital stay . Researchers notify random assignment day 5 . In control group patient treat accord routine practice 9 day longer . In group interference duration antibiotic treatment . In `` clinical guideline '' group patent receive antibiotic minimum 5 day , antibiotic discontinue temperature ≤ 37,8ºC 48 hour one sign clinical instability ( see section definition ) attest . Once situation stability attain , participate hospital research team doctor instruct physician charge patient drop antibiotic treatment moment . In patient `` clinical guideline '' group degree compliance study algorythm note reason justify skip case present . The evolution clinical trial monitor independent monitoring team . Research team member involve decision relate discharge hospital . After hospital discharge patient care depend correspoding family physician . A control visit schedule 30th day admission . Study location . Multicenter study take place 4 public network Bizkaian hospital : Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital , Basurto Hospital , Txagorritxu Hospital San Eloy Hospital . Study subject . For period 18 month adult patient , 18 old , admitted CAP include sequentially . Pneumonia define pulmonary infiltrate show thoracic X-ray know old , plus symptom consistent pneumonia , cough , dysnea , fever and/or pleuritic chest pain . The following patient exclude : patient human immunodeficiency virus infection , immunosupressed patient ( solid organ transplant , spelenectomy , treat prednisone dose 10 mg/day equivalent long 30 day immunodepressors , neutropenia ) , hospitalize 14 day prior live assist care facility . Pneumonia case cause infrequent agent ( i.e . P. aerouginosa , S. Aureus ) also exclude , well infectious process require extend treatment antibiotocs ( i.e . bacterial endocarditis , abscess ) , pneumonia case pleural effusion require drainage tube , patient decease admitted ICU randomization give informed consent . A total 1100 case include period study . Losses : case register data correspond main goal ( loss estimate &lt; 5 % ) . A comparative analysis lose non-lost patient . For purpose socio-demographic clinical variable include , well related severity admission Charlson index ( Charlson ME et al . J Chronic Dis 1987 ; 40:373-83 ) . Ethical aspect . All patient inform study ask give informed consent ( see annex 2 ) . All data treat follow law protection personal data ( Organic Law 15/1999 , 13-12 ) . The study database protect security access measure patient ' identification data stay separate rest information include database . Sample size . We choose equivalence hypothesis mortality rate control group ( conventional guideline ) intervention group ( `` clinical guideline group '' , treatment template follow clinical guideline recommendation ) . For unilateral ( non-inferiority ) contrast ( a=0.05 , 1- b=0.80 ) 545 patient need group , able reject null hypothesis non-equivalence treatment follow new clinical guideline oppose conventional guideline . We assume equivalence margin 1 % ( http : //people.ucalgary.ca/~patten/blackwelder.html ) . Sample size calculate assume 5 % rate loss follow-up . Independent variable . 1- severity admission time . During 24 hour follow arrival hospital 's Emergency Service requisite variable gather calculate risk class establish Pneumonia Severity Index ( PSI ) ( Fine MJ , et al . N Engl J Med 1997 ; 36:243-50 ) CURB65 scale ( Confusion , Urea nitrogen , Respiratory rate , Blood pressure , Age ) ( Lim WS , et al . Thorax 2003 ; 58:377-82 ) ; 2- comorbidities ; 3-Charlson index ; 4- treatment give : antibiotic prior admission ; adherence antibiotic treatment SEPAR provision ; initiation antibiotic treatment first 8 hour ; transition intravenous oral medication ; use non-invasive mechanical ventilation ; 5- bacteriological diagnosis . During acute phase two hemocultures , sputum culture urinary antigen test include , blood test atypical bacteria perform acute remission phase . Dependent variable . 1- mortality cause 15 day period admission . The in-hospital mortality 30 day also analyze . 2- clinical recovery 10th ( recovery test - see definition section ) 30th day ; 3- clinical evolution 5th 10th treatment day , measured PRO scale ; specific validate 18-item questionnaire use ( Lamping DL , et al . Chest 2002 ; 122:920-9 ) ; 4- duration antibiotic treatment time hospitalization ( day ) day without antibiotic ( period 24 hour without antibiotic ) 30th day . 5- hospital readmission within 30 day . 6- duration hospital stay . 7- clinical recovery ( number day ) ; 8- recurrence initial infection superinfection need additional alternative antibiotic treatment ( within 30 day ) ; 9- number day work due disease ( within 30 day ) ; 10- number day adverse effect medication ( within 30 day ) ; 11- number day usual ( recreation work ) activity restrict pneumonia ( within 30 day ) ; 12- in-hospital complication 30 day ; 13- need additional medication . Information collection . Patients include study admit PAC . A protocol data collection study group design . Clinical stability criterion collect daily twice day admission period . The study variable collect hospital stay mean structure telephone interview 10th ( unless patient still hospitalize ) 30th day . All data collect trained blinded staff . Antibiotic treatment . All patient shall treat accord SEPAR recommendation ( Arch Bronconeumol 2010 ; 46:543-58 ) : group inpatient , ICU . Intravenous beta-lactam ( amoxicillin/clavulanate cefotaxime ceftriasone ) plus intravenous macrolide ( azitromicyn claritromicyn ) , intravenous levofloxacine ; group ICU-admitted patient . Intravenous beta-lactam ( cefotaxime ceftriasone ) plus intravenous macrolide ( azitromycin claritromycin ) , intravenous beta-lactam ( cefotaxime ceftriasone ) plus intravenous levofloxacine . The Research Team insist start antibiotic treatment soon possible patient treat fluoroquinolone beta-lactam macrolides . The ultimate decision correspond physician charge patient . Definitions . Clinical instability : systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ; breathe rate &gt; 24 breath/min ; heart rate &gt; 100 heartbeats/min ; O2 saturation &lt; 90 % O2 arterial pressure &lt; 60mmHg . Patients receive oxygen supplement consider stable O2 ≥95 % saturation . Clinical recovery ( cure test ) : resolution improvement symptom clinical sign relate pneumonia without need additional alternative antibiotic treatment . Clinical recovery follow-up 30 day : continuance resolution improvement symptom clinical sign relate pneumonia without need additional alternative antibiotic treatment . Recurrence : new ( worsen ) symptom sign relate pneumonia new infection respiratory tract patient consider cure 10th day visit . Statistical analysis : For descriptive analysis use average , standard deviation , median rank quantitave variable percentage qualitative one . The fundamental analysis include : 1 ) first , order make sure randomization do correctly , fundamental basal variable study compare intervention group control group verify statistically significant difference group variable . Intermediate analysis perform every three month follow-up see whether difference group may justify discontinue study . 2 ) To respond fundamental goal hypothesis study univariate analysis perform compare main secondary dependent variable two group patient ( main independent variable ) . A subanalysis severe patient also conduct ( PSI IV V ) . For comparison quantitative variable control group intervention group Student 's test Wilcoxon 's non-parametric test use , depend whether study variable follow normal distribution . For comparison qualitative variable Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use . In adition comparative analysis basal characteristic lose non-lost patient perform , use statistical test previously mention . Problems Limitations Study : 1- As every clinical trial , main problem may patient ' lack interest become part study , although attempt reduce impact factor explain study objective , possible benefit risk general interest , rest pneumonia patient ; 2- In `` clinical guideline '' group ultimate decision discontinue antibiotic treatment reach clinical stability criterion depend physician charge patient . It possible may find occasional resistance conform establish protocol . In order neutralize protocol transgression much possible , decision discontinue antibiotic treatment analyze previously hospital member research team , relay physician charge . This way one hand ensure compliance case establish clinical trial , , encourage individual physician 's cooperation . At rate , protocol skip , reason surround case record . 3- Multicenter study complicate operational point view . There possibility ratio eligible include patient might differ one location ( ) , number case include bear relationship size service population . In order neutralize effect introduce hospital factor statistical analysis , besides study hospital 's caseload separately compare .</detailed_description>
