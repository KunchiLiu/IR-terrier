	<brief_summary>BIOFLEX-I EU European arm BIOFLEX-I IDE study ( NCT01319812 ) . Data BIOFLEX-I EU pool data IDE . The objective study separately demonstrate clinical performance BIOTRONIK 's Astron Pulsar-18 stent European arm BIOFLEX-I IDE ( NCT01319812 ) . The Pulsar-18 stent use treatment femoro-popliteal lesion , locate native superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) proximal popliteal artery ( PPA ) , Astron stent use treatment common external iliac artery lesion .</brief_summary>

Thigh toe brachial index ( TBI ) may use / performed ABI inadequate . Written informed consent . One de novo , restenotic occlude lesion represent femoropopliteal iliac indication OR Two de novo , restenotic occlude lesion represent one femoropopliteal indication one iliac indication contralateral limb ( i.e . one target lesion per limb ) . Lesions may one solid lesion series multiple , small lesion treat one lesion . Subjects bilateral , SFA/PPA disease ( i.e . one SFA/PPA lesion per limb ) eligible enrolment study . The target lesion select investigator 's discretion base study eligibility criterion . The contralateral SFA/PPA intervention may perform time index procedure ( prior treatment study lesion ) ; however , use investigational treatment prohibit . If contralateral SFA/PPA intervention perform time index procedure , intervention must perform least 30 day index procedure . The use investigational treatment contralateral intervention prohibit .
