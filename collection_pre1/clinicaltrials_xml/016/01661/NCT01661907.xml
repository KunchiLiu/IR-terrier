This indicated stress response produce surgery might important role pathogenesis delirium . It report , compare general anesthesia postoperative intravenous analgesia , neuraxial anesthesia analgesia reduce occurrence postoperative complication mortality high risk patient . Combined epidural-general anesthesia frequently use clinical practice . This anesthesia method provide advantage epidural general anesthesia , i.e . block afferent pathway nociceptive stimulus neuraxial blockade surgery , allow patient endure lengthy complicate operation without awareness . The investigator hypothesize combine epidural-general anesthesia postoperative epidural analgesia decrease incidence postoperative delirium , thus , improve prognosis critically ill elderly patient undergo major surgery .

	<detailed_description>Delirium transient mental syndrome acute onset characterize global impairment cognitive function , reduce level consciousness , abnormality attention , increase decreased psychomotor activity , disorder sleep-wake cycle . Postoperative delirium common complication critically ill patient surgery . Dyer et al review 80 primary study find mean incidence postoperative delirium 36.8 % ( range 0 % -73.5 % ) surgery . It occur 80 % patient ICU . Our recent study find incidence postoperative delirium occur patient SICU 51.0 % cardiac surgery 44.5 % non-cardiac surgery . The occurrence postoperative delirium associate bad outcomes patient . Studies show delirious patient prolong ICU stay , increase incidence complication , prolonged hospitalization , high mortality rate , increase health care cost . Delirium also associate increase risk long-term cognitive decline poor quality life . A recent follow-up study ( mean follow-up time 27.9 ± 3.1 month ) research group find , adjust factor age , occurrence postoperative complication , stage malignant tumor , etc , occurrence postoperative delirium still remain independent predictor long-term mortality patient . The pathophysiology delirium remain poorly understood . A universal phenomenon delirium frequently identify elderly patient major complicate surgery , rarely note minor ambulatory surgery ( cataract surgery ) . Studies also find postoperative pain independent risk factor delirium , effective pain relief may help reduce incidence delirium . Our recent study patient undergoing cardiac non-cardiac surgery show high serum cortisol level independent predictor postoperative delirium . In addition , inflammatory response may also contribute pathogenesis delirium . Trauma , pain , cortisol secretion inflammation important component surgical stress response . The result indicate stress response produce surgery might important role pathogenesis delirium . Previous study demonstrate , compare general anesthesia , neuraxial anesthesia attenuate hypersecretion cortisol , decrease intensity inflammatory response effectively surgery . And epidural analgesia provide well postoperative pain relief intravenous analgesia . It also report , compare general anesthesia intravenous analgesia , neuraxial anesthesia analgesia reduce occurrence postoperative complication mortality high risk patient . Combined epidural-general anesthesia frequently use clinical practice , perform 1/4 patient undergoing surgery applicant 's hospital . Theoretically , anesthesia method provide advantage epidural general anesthesia , i.e . block afferent pathway nociceptive stimulus neuraxial blockade surgery , allow patient endure lengthy complicate operation without awareness . However , evidence whether combine epidural-general anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia decrease incidence postoperative delirium , thus , improve outcome elderly patient undergo major surgery . The objective study compare effect combine epidural-general anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia general anesthesia/postoperative intravenous analgesia incidence postoperative delirium elderly patient undergo major surgery .</detailed_description>
