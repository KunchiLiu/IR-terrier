	<brief_summary>Multi-agent chemotherapy value patient advance pancreatic-biliary cancer lead response substantial minority increase survival . The use FOLFIRINOX regimen limit ' intensity toxicity . Previous protocol clinical experience within University Michigan Pancreatic Program lead expectation tolerance efficacy propose regimen . Advantages propose regimen relative FOLFIRINOX include : 1 . Substitution gemcitabine irinotecan . Single agent activity gemcitabine least good irinotecan ( probably well , especially deliver FDR [ fixed-dose rate ] infusion ) gemcitabine much well tolerate less diarrhea , nausea/emesis , myelosuppression alopecia . 2 . Deletion leucovorin infusion 5FU bolus injection lessen myelosuppression , mucositis diarrhea . 3 . Substitution cisplatin oxaliplatin reduce cost therapy avoid cold aggravate dysesthesia . Presuming evidence efficacy confirmation tolerance propose regimen , investigator believe treatment may widely applicable pancreatic-biliary cancer patient , include advanced disease well consider use locally advance neo- adjuvant setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine combine 5FU may enhance activity 5-FU vivo . Gemcitabine inhibitor ribonucleotide reductase , enzyme need synthesis deoxynucleotides , 5-FU interferes dTTP synthesis inhibition thymidylate synthase ( TS ) . It likely concomitant administration gemcitabine 5FU result increase cytotoxicity reduce intracellular dTTP thru two different mechanism , thereby inhibit DNA replication repair . Platinum compound lead cell death form DNA adduct cause double strand break . By inhibit DNA synthesis repair , gemcitabine 5-FU potentiate activity cisplatin . These interaction underlie clinical synergism observe platinum/5FU platinum/gemcitabine combination .</detailed_description>
