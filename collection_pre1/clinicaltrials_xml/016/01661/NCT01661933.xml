	<brief_summary>We establish hookworm Necator americanus ( Na ) dramatically alter local systemic immune landscape infect human host . Consistent principle desensitisation , diet manage celiac disease subject previously infect u Na invite receive small incremental dos gluten pasta ( 3-25 mm straw spaghetti ) 16 week . Each participant carefully re-assessed determine appropriate undertake 12-week gluten challenge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Desensitising Celiac Disease Patients With Human Hookworm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis The adaptive Th2/regulatory profile impose Na promote gluten tolerance follow micro-dose desensitise programme . Primary Aim : To determine safety efficacy Na tolerising agent celiac subject Specific Aim 1 . Undertake therapeutic pilot study compare mucosal histopathology gluten challenge , precede programmed desensitise micro-challenge use Na tolerising agent . Specific Aim 2 . Assess systemic mucosal immune response gluten micro-challenge , Na infection , gluten re-challenge throughout pilot study , reference hookworm-naive people treat untreated celiac disease . Specific Aim 3 . Utilising blood tissue hookworm-naive celiac disease volunteer , undertake vitro study focus effect Na-derived excretory/secretory ( ES ) product gluten-stimulated gut mucosal cell apoptosis , cytokine gene profile .</detailed_description>
