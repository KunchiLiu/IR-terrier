	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate benefit treatment refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction standard treatment endolymphatic hydrops . Eustachian tube dysfunction common diagnosis make otolaryngology relate abnormal pressure equalization middle ear space relate swollen , inflame , occlude Eustachian tube . The symptom include perceived hearing loss , feel fullness affect ear/ears , ear pain , ear popping , occasionally imbalance . These symptom overlap rare difficult diagnose condition know endolymphatic hydrops , overproduction fluid inner ear . The treatment two condition distinct traditionally , patient treat Eustachian tube dysfunction first much common several treatment , namely nasal steroid , antihistamine , pressure equalization tube . For patient improve treatment , often treat diuretic low salt diet treat suppose endolymphatic hydrops . There never study investigate utility treatment patient refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction . There also reason believe chronic ETD effusion lead inner middle ear dysfunction . Thus , study aim determine benefit standard endolymphatic hydrops treatment patient refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction symptom prospective fashion . Hypothesis : Patients refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction ( patient minimal symptom improvement despite nasal steroid antihistamine treatment follow myringotomy tube placement ) element endolymphatic hydrops patient 's symptom improve low sodium diet diuretic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Refractory Eustachian Tube Dysfunction : Are Symptoms Related Endolymphatic Hydrops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eustachian tube dysfunction one common problem encounter general otolaryngology clinical practice . Symptoms ear pressure , decrease hearing , ear pain , ear popping , frequent ear infection often blame inability Eustachian tube equalize air pressure across ear drum . If Eustachian tube occlude , middle ear space becomes close chamber normal gas exchange occur . Treatment Eustachian dysfunction traditionally focus two tier system . First , patient often place nasal steroid antihistamine . This medication regimen lead decrease nasal inflammation , mucosal swelling , treat nasal allergy . In many patient , treatment improves symptoms completely reduces tolerable level . If patient 's symptom improve , next step management create surgical tract middle ear via myringotomy ( hole across ear drum ) placing pressure equalization tube across tympanic membrane . This bypass anatomical obstruction Eustachian tube allow middle ear pressure equalize atmospheric pressure across tympanic membrane . Unfortunately , despite , patient refractory symptom , often ear pressure subjectively decrease hearing . These symptom also frequently associate inner ear disease , specifically endolymphatic hydrops . Endolymphatic hydrops felt related production endolymphatic fluid , fluid within inner ear . Thus , propose patient 's refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction experience inner ear phenomenon , would benefit treatment similar endolymphatic hydrops ( production endolymphatic fluid ) manage . The mainstays management endolymphatic hydrops low sodium diet diuretic treatment ( hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene ) . Both treatment aim reduce endolymph production .</detailed_description>
