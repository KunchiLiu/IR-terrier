	<brief_title>Management Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myocardial injury common major vascular complication noncardiac surgery . Worldwide approximately 10 million adult annually suffer perioperative myocardial injury . This figure perioperative myocardial injury represent 15-20 % case myocardial infarction setting . Myocardial injury noncardiac surgery carry poor prognosis independent predictor 30-day 1-year mortality . Myocardial injury noncardiac surgery ( MINS ) differ non-operative myocardial infarction two way ; poor prognosis ( patient suffer MINS 2 time likely die within 30 day compare non-operative myocardial infarction emergency room ) paradoxically treatment less intensive . This difference intensity treatment likely influence several factor include : ( 1 ) majority patient suffer MINS experience ischemic symptom , potentially influence physician ' perception severity event ; ( 2 ) debate pathophysiology MINS ( although emerge evidence suggest coronary arterial thrombosis important mechanism MINS ) ; ( 3 ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate intervention manage MINS , hence physician uncertain risk-benefit ratio potential intervention ( e.g. , intervention effective management non-operative myocardial infarction ) . From human economic perspective , tragedy patient undergoing noncardiac surgery important reason ( e.g. , obtain cure cancer become mobile new prosthetic joint ) fail obtain benefit , suffer MINS ultimately take life . There urgent need clinical trial identify effective therapy improve outcome patient suffer MINS . There exist promise laboratory , autopsy , imaging , operative , non-operative data suggest patient suffer MINS benefit anticoagulant therapy . Dabigatran ( direct thrombin inhibitor ) warrant evaluation management MINS . The major limitation anticoagulation therapy bleeding , gastrointestinal bleeding represent substantial proportion complication . Gastrointestinal bleed important right , also lead cessation anticoagulant therapy may lead breakthrough myocardial infarction . Omeprazole ( proton pump inhibitor ) efficacious prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding patient coronary artery disease take dual antiplatelet therapy , may benefit patient receive anticoagulation therapy suffering MINS . We undertake large international RCT determine impact dabigatran patient suffer MINS . We use partial factorial design ( patient take proton pump inhibitor ) determine impact omeprazole setting . We call RCT Management myocardial injury After NoncArdiac surGEry ( MANAGE ) Trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible : 1. undergone noncardiac surgery ; 2. ≥45 year age ; 3. suffer MINS base upon fulfil one follow criterion : A. Elevated troponin CKMB measurement one follow define feature i. ischemic sign symptom ( i.e. , chest , arm , neck , jaw discomfort ; shortness breath , pulmonary edema ) ; ii . development pathologic Q wave present two contiguous lead ≥30 millisecond ; iii . electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change indicative ischemia ( i.e. , ST segment elevation [ ≥2 mm lead V1 , V2 , V3 OR ≥1 mm lead ] , ST segment depression [ ≥1 mm ] , OR symmetric inversion T wave ≥1 mm ) least two contiguous lead ; iv . new LBBB ; v. new presume new cardiac wall motion abnormality echocardiography new presumed new fix defect radionuclide image B. Elevated troponin measurement surgery alternative explanation ( e.g. , pulmonary embolism , sepsis ) myocardial injury ; AND 4. provide write informed consent participate within 35 day suffer MINS . Patients meet follow criterion exclude : 1. hypersensitivity know allergy dabigatran ; 2. history intracranial , intraocular , spinal bleeding ; 3. hemorrhagic disorder bleed diathesis ; 4. know hepatic impairment liver disease expect impact survival ; 5. condition require therapeutic dose anticoagulation ( e.g. , prosthetic heart valve , venous thromboembolism , atrial fibrillation ) ; 6. currently use plan initiate rifampicin , cyclosporine , itraconazole , tacrolimus , ketoconazole , dronedarone ; 7. woman pregnant , breastfeeding , childbearing potential refuse use medically acceptable form contraception throughout study ; 8. investigator considers patient unreliable regard requirement study followup study drug compliance ; OR 9. previously enrol MANAGE Trial . Also exclude patient follow criterion persist beyond 35 day suffer MINS : 1. attend surgeon believe safe initiate therapeutic dose anticoagulation therapy ; 2. attend physician believe ASA , intermittent pneumatic compression , elastic stocking sufficient venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prophylaxis patient require prophylacticdose anticoagulant ; 3. patient indwell epidural spinal catheter remove , first dose dabigatran occur within 4 hour epidural catheter removal ; OR 4. estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 35 ml/min estimate calculated creatinine clearance . 5. expected patient undergo cardiac catheterization MINS . Exclusion Criteria Specific Patients Omeprazole Factorial Component Trial : Patients meet follow criterion : 1. hypersensitivity know allergy omeprazole ; 2. requirement proton pump inhibitor , H2receptor antagonist , sucralfate , atazanavir , clopidogrel , misoprostol ; 3. esophageal gastric variceal disease ; OR 4. patient decline participation omeprazole arm MANAGE .</criteria>
