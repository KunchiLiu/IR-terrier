They similar mechanism action work equally well , however ranibizumab design use eye . It significantly expensive per injection bevacizumab ( factor roughly 40x ) . In published study trend noted towards increase rate systemic side effect heart attack stroke . This presumably due absorption drug ( ) eye bloodstream , however never show . The purpose investigator study compare bloodstream level bevacizumab ranibizumab various time point injection eye .
