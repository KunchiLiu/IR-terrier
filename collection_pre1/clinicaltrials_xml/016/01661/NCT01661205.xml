	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety technical feasibility treat subject Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation minimally invasive thoracoscopic ablation procedure utilizing AtriCure Bipolar System , map additional lesion creation/ gap closure ( need ) provide currently approve catheter technology , epicardial endocardial phase perform staged manner within 1-10 day apart , hospitalization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Epicardial Endocardial Persistent Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) Study ( Staged DEEP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical investigation evaluate safe less invasive cardiac surgery use AtriCure Bipolar System conjunction catheter ablation procedure perform approximately 1-10 day , treat atrial fibrillation , effective stag procedure . The AtriCure Bipolar System use perform less invasive cardiac surgery standard electrophysiology catheter , currently available , use perform catheter ablation procedure . This surgical procedure consider less invasive do tiny surgical puncture side chest near rib instead one large surgical incision breast bone completely open chest access heart , also avoids need heart-lung bypass machine .</detailed_description>
