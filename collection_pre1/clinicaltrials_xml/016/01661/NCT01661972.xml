	<brief_summary>The Primary Phase I objectives determine recommend phase II dose capecitabine aflibercept doublet combination ; describe dose limit non-dose limiting toxicity . The Phase II Primary objective determine progression free survival associate regimen . The Phase II secondary objective determine response rate associate regimen ; determine overall survival associate regimen ; explore correlation clinical outcome baseline treatment change blood-based angiogenesis biomarkers . This open-label , non-randomized phase I/II trial design assess safety , tolerability RPTD capecitabine plus aflibercept adult subject metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

For phase II portion , patient must histologically and/or cytologically confirm metastatic colorectal carcinoma progress , intolerant , inappropriate standard therapy . Subjects must treat fluoropyrimidine ( e.g. , 5fluorouracil capecitabine ) , oxaliplatin , irinotecan bevacizumab contraindication treatment . Prior epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) target agent ( contraindication drug ) require subject KRas wildtype tumor 2 . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion ( see Appendix 1 ) . Previously irradiate site include documented progression disease site . 3 . Age 18 year old . 4 . KPS &gt; 70 % ( see Appendix 2 ) 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 6 . Adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN liver metastasis ) Creatinine clearance â‰¥50 mls/min CockcroftGault Urine Protein/Creatinine ratio &lt; 1 ( protein &lt; 1+ urinalysis 24hour urine protein &lt; 1gram/24 hour ) 7 . Previous radiotherapy palliation recurrent disease allow &gt; 4 week elapse since completion therapy . 8 . Ability take oral medication . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 10 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day day 1 study drug ; men woman must willing use two method contraception , one barrier method study 6 month last study drug administration . 11 . Signed informed consent 1 . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week day 1 study drug ( include investigational agent , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) 2 . History severe hypersensitivity reactions/anaphylaxis attribute humanized and/or chimeric monoclonal antibody proteins . 3 . History significant intolerance capecitabine 5FU ( ie . Grade 4 toxicity relate one agent ; grade 34 toxicity relate concurrently administer agent exclusion ) . 4 . History abdominal fistula gastrointestinal perforation point within 6 month prior day 1 study drug , unless surgically repair . 5 . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) , diverticular disease gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation gastrointestinal bleeding . 6 . Active bleeding diathesis history major bleeding , CNS bleeding , significant hemoptysis within 6 month enrollment . 7 . Anticoagulation warfarin ( anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin exclusion ) . 8 . History arterial thromboembolic event symptomatic pulmonary embolism within 6 month study enrollment . 9 .
