	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ularitide Treatment Acute Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective TRUE-AHF study evaluate effect 48-h continuous IV infusion ularitide ( 15 ng/kg/min ) versus placebo clinical status patient acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) . The study drug administer addition standard treatment . The nature standard therapy carry accord clinical judgment Investigator may include vasodilator , inotropic , diuretic drug , clinically indicate . There two co-primary endpoint study . Co-primary endpoint 1 hierarchical clinical composite variable include patient-centered assessment clinical progress , assessment lack improvement worsen HF require pre-specified intervention , death . The endpoint intend mimic assessment would carry physician care patient . If , 48 h infusion , patient 's clinical course deteriorate he/she dy , fails improve develop worsen HF require pre-specified intervention patient considers his/her general clinical status moderately markedly bad , patient consider `` bad '' . If patient considers his/her general clinical status moderately markedly improve improvement sustain without fulfil criterion `` bad '' throughout 48-h infusion ( 0 h 48 h ) , patient consider `` improved '' . If patient neither improved worse , patient 's clinical status consider `` unchanged '' . Co-primary efficacy endpoint 2 evaluate freedom cardiovascular mortality follow randomization , entire duration trial .</detailed_description>
