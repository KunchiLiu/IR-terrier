	<brief_title>Time Eradication Mycoplasma Genitalium Chlamydia Trachomatis After Treatment Commenced</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycoplasma genitalium ( Mg ) , detected 1980 , cause urogenital infection sexual transmission . In contrast Chlamydia trachomatis antibiotic resistance common tetracycline emerge macrolides azithromycin . Both antibiotic recommend first line treatment chlamydia infection . Recent publish data , however , indicate 1g azithromycin stat may bacteriostatic treat chlamydia . The consensus date always test cure pregnant woman treat chlamydia individual treat Mg . There study publish , knowledge , time eradication antibiotic treatment commence Mg infection evaluate . The first line treatment confirm Mg infection azithromycin 1.5 g give period 5 day . If macrolide resistance plausible confirm moxifloxacin 400mg 7 10 day recommend . Individuals symptomatic urethritis cervicitis and/or sexual partner individual treat suspect confirm Mg CT infection eligible . The study subject patient attend either STD-clinics Norrköping Västervik , Sweden . All sample send Statens Serum Institut ( SSI ) , Mycoplasma department ( Jorgen Skov Jensen ) analysis . Patients accept enrolment confirm highly suspect Mg receive azithromycin 500 mg first day 250mg follow four day . Patients macrolide resistant Mg-strain infection highly suspect receive moxifloxacin 400 mg daily seven day . Those subject intend treatment lower degree suspicion Mg infection randomize either treatment doxycycline 200 mg first day 100 mg daily follow nine day ( custom recommendation Sweden treatment chlamydia non-specific urethritis cervicitis ) OR treatment azithromycin 1g single dose . All participant give test kit 12 sample , sample three time weekly ( every second day ) four week start day first day treatment . They instruct sexual intercourse first week condom afterwards study period . The sample send weekly ( three sample ) SSI.The date sampling note label tube attach paper SSI , also symptoms note . The result test send STD-clinic informed patient . The study start February 2010 inclusion patient end subject verified M genitalium infection ( February 2014 ) , whereas patient verify suspected chlamydia infection still enrol randomised azithromycin 1 g doxycycline . A manuscript soon submit concern subject treat M genitalium infection . To date 190 patient enrol also fulfil study protocol sample specimen .</detailed_description>
