	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot project determine whether use inertial sensor place waist routine clinical balance testing ( i.e . Balance Error Scoring System ) ( BESS ) , immediate , objective , reliable sensitive way measure quantify balance deficit individual mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) . The investigator also try observe sensor use detect balance recovery mTBI .

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot project determine whether use inertial sensor ( ipod like device ) place waist routine clinical balance testing ( i.e . Balance Error Scoring System ( BESS ) , immediate , objective , reliable sensitive way measure quantify balance deficit individual mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) . The investigator also try observe sensor use detect balance recovery mTBI . The participant recruit local university 's athletic department . The participant undergo balance test BESS test wear sensor around waist.The BESS consist different balance test ; balance one leg tandem standing . The participant also answer questionnaire daily life cognitive test . If participant mTBI complete questionnaire symptom injury may perform additional IMPACT test computerize cognitive test use coach , athletic trainer manage physician . Along clinical balance test questionnaire , project use small sensor place waist detect sway quiet stance . An automatic analysis occur provide u immediate feedback stable participant testing .</detailed_description>
