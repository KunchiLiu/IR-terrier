	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : Assess effectiveness Prevena Incision Management System decrease postoperative surgical site infection obese parturient undergo non-emergent cesarean delivery . Aim 2 : Assess patient satisfaction use Prevena Incision Management System follow non-emergent cesarean delivery . Our overall long term goal reduce morbidity incidence surgical site infection ( SSI ) obese parturient undergo non-emergent cesarean delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Prevena Incision Management System Reduce Post-operative Cesarean Delivery Wound Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , cesarean delivery rate continue rise . In 2007 , approximately 32 % birth occur Cesarean delivery , translate 1.4 million woman underwent operative procedure . Oklahoma par national average , 33.6 % birth occur Cesarean delivery ( 1 ) . Although 2006 Cesarean delivery commonly perform surgical procedure United States , remain vulnerable common , well rare , complication . Despite continued advance surgical aseptic technique , surgical site infection ( SSI ) continue area concern patient , physician , hospital , insurer . In addition negative impact patient quality life , surgical site infection ( SSI ) estimate require additional three thousand dollar per infection healthcare expenditure ( 2 ) . In surgical patient , estimate SSI account 25 38 % hospital acquire infection ( 3-4 ) 2-5 % patient undergoing surgery type develop SSI ( 5 ) . In cesarean delivery particular , rate SSI 3 15 % , depend population , definition SSI , modifiable risk factor ( 6 ) . In particular , one factor show increase risk SSI multiple study obesity odds ratio 1.1-4.79 depend degree BMI stratification ( 6-8 ) . Given prevalence cost , SSI represent postoperative complication far reach consequence make area increase focus research . Recently , negative pressure wound therapy come forefront demonstrate improve healing reduced complication open close surgical wound various type . A review literature illustrate prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy device effectiveness reduce SSI widely evaluate cesarean delivery . The goal study evaluate wound infection rate use Prevena Incision Management System obese patient undergo non-emergent cesarean delivery tertiary care center . We propose initiate randomize clinical trial Prevena Incision Management System novel population patient high risk surgical site infection . Given possibility unexpected challenge , propose begin project pilot study order help elucidate factor may need include large study future . Also , anticipate pilot study give u good insight rate wind complication potential difference group order good power large study . Rationale study : Obese patient undergo Cesarean delivery frequent SSIs secondary modifiable non-modifiable risk factor . A randomized control trial Prevena Incision Management System , single use negative pressure therapy unit design placement clean close surgical incision , help reduce rate surgical site infection increase overall quality life patient .</detailed_description>
