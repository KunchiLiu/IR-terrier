	<brief_summary>Infections cause protozoan parasite Leishmania include cutaneous ( CL ) , mucosal ( ML ) visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) . Over 12 million people currently suffer leishmaniasis , approximately 2 million new case occur annually , make major global health problem . CL CL cause Leishmania tropica endemic around city Bikaner Thar Desert region State Rajasthan . WHO recommend antimonials sodium stibogluconate ( SSG ) treat CL . However , drug toxic poor patient compliance require multiple intramuscular intralesional injection 3 week . In addition , emergence drug-resistant strain rapidly increase worldwide . We interest novel treatment CL safe , easy administer effective induce long-term cure . Recently , radio-frequency-induced heat ( RFH ) therapy use treat CL . This treatment involve control localized delivery radiofrequencies lesions 30-60 second local anesthesia . Several short-term follow-up ( 4-5 month ) study well one long-term follow-up ( 12 month ) study involve US soldier infect L. major Iraq find RFH therapy comparable , even well , systemic antimonials . However , study need establish long-term efficacy RFH therapy treatment CL cause Leishmania specie difficult treat conventional drug , determine risk disease recurrence patient live Leishmania endemic region . The goal trial compare long term efficacy RFH therapy treatment CL cause L. tropica patient reside Leishmania-endemic region India .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study location participant : Subjects study recruit among child age 1-17 adult age 18-85 visit dermatology outpatient clinic PBM Hospital , Bikaner , suspect CL . Informed consent obtain adult parents/legal guardian minor procedure inclusion study . Individuals uncontrolled chronic medical condition , breast feeding , immunosuppressive drug anticipate unavailability follow-up exclude study . Patients 4 lesion also exclude . Study procedure : The diagnosis CL establish clinical examination , history residence L. tropica-endemic area , microscopic examination Giemsa-stained lesion smear parasites ( Leishmania tropica body ) lesion biopsy . For patient smear skin biopsy negative , PCR use detect parasite lesion tissue . The lesion surround skin clean stabilized 0.1 % chlorine dioxide solution , local anesthesia administer subcutaneous injection 2 % Lidocaine around lesion . RFH therapy administer single , control localized delivery radio frequency lesion 30-60 second use current field radio-frequency generator ( ThermoMed 1.8 ; Thermosurgery Inc. USA ) . Patients prescribed oral NSAID topical antimicrobial cream 5 day . Cure infection recurrence monitor clinical follow-up day 10 month 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 18 month post-treatment .</detailed_description>
