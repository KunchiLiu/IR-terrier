	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis common lethal genetic disorder Caucasian population . Mutations Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) affect ability act chloride channel . The recent development transgenic pig model CF demonstrate newborn CF lung , free bacteria inflammation birth , become colonized mixed microbial flora likely initiate early inflammatory change precede clinically apparent deterioration lung function . Because chronic infection inflammation play central role CF disease progression exacerbation , many clinician researcher focus identify pathogen associate CF infection inflammation . Recent study outside area CF , however , clearly demonstrate `` non-pathogens '' , commensal flora carry human multiple mucosal site , engage host 's innate adaptive immune system constantly . This interaction `` microbiome '' host genome responsible appropriate development function protective inflammatory immune response . We hypothesize acquisition commensal flora newborn CF may play critical role initiate pathogenic inflammatory response subsequently lead lung damage . The acquire commensal flora may initially identical non-CF infant , may alter direct indirect effect CFTR mutation mucosal environment . Such altered flora likely encode different metabolic regulatory function , may directly influence host inflammatory response . If , novel therapeutic opportunity may exist modulate commensal flora , manipulate immunomodulatory function way interrupt insidious cycle inflammation damage characterize CF . We propose test hypothesis three specific aim : ( 1 ) Describe acquisition evolution gut respiratory tract microbiomes CF infant non-CF control ; ( 2 ) Determine relationship microbiota marker inflammation two cohort ; ( 3 ) Determine whether early decline lung function associate inflammatory biomarkers microbiome composition/function . This study novel focus rarely studied population , time intervention might significantly impact progression lethal disease preserve pulmonary function . Its innovation lie apply state art technology method sample collect simply non-invasively , thus increase likelihood finding study translate clinical practice .</detailed_description>
