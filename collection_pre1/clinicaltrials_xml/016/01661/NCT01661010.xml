	<brief_summary>Purpose/Lay Summary : Background : - Chromosomes structure inside cell carry genetic material ( gene ) . Certain difference sex chromosome know cause various disease , infertility , Turner syndrome , Klinefelter syndrome . However , fully understood difference see clinical finding may cause different sex chromosome variant . This study seek learn genetic clinical characteristic disorder related X Y chromosome . Objectives : - To study related medical condition people sex chromosome variant . Eligibility : - Patients know sex chromosome difference may eligible participate . - Healthy volunteer age 18 - 55 Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - This study last 5 day . Participants variety endocrine test . They provide blood , urine , semen sample test . - Imaging study heart abdomen perform . These test may include ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging . - Participants also vision hear check . - Healthy volunteer single day visit medical history , physical exam , blood skin sample . - Treatment provide part study . - Compensation offer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Study Sex Chromosome Variants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertility disease affect approximately 10 % couple world-wide . Causes infertility varied include age-related decline fecundity , cause ovulatory dysfunction , tubal pelvic pathology , male cause , idiopathic , multifactorial . The underlying genetic cause infertility incompletely understood . The purpose study increase understand genetic clinical manifestation infertility relate Ychromosome difference detail physical , radiologic , laboratory study . We concentrate group patient ( male female ) know Y-chromosome variation infertility previously identify collaborator , Dr. David Page lab . Patients recruit consent study evaluate NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients previously identify outside research diagnostic labs sexchromosome variant cause deletion/duplication sexlinked gene entire sex chromosome , male female . 2 . In event patient sexchromosome variant selfrefers protocol , medical record review committee include Dr. David Page , Dr. Maximilian Muenke , others decide whether patient appropriate enrollment protocol . 3 . Willing family member subject enrol may enrol control subject . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent assent . 2 . We reserve right exclude patient medical condition would place potential participant high risk complication manage NIH clinical center ( ex . dialysis dependency , unstable cardiac condition , unstable severe depression/suicidality ) . 3 . We reserve right exclude case clearly related Ychromosome variant , infertility direct research interest ( e.g . infertility clearly nongenetic etiology ) . This almost never happen , would attempt make referral appropriate investigator . It intention try remove many economic , cultural , geographic , racial , gender barrier reasonably promote diverse participation infertility case research purpose .</criteria>
