	<detailed_description>1.Rationale Specific Aims Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common cancer second frequent cause cancer related mortality United States . Animal human study suggest marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) , eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , cancer inhibitory property conversely , n-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid ( ARA ) may promote tumorigenesis . The mechanism behind oppose effect likely due difference biological activity eicosanoids end product effect chronic inflammation . Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) pro-inflammatory eicosanoid aberrantly produce colorectal adenoma cancer derive ARA via cyclo-oxygenase pathway . EPA convert pathway prostaglandin E3 , 4 7- fold less prostaglandin E receptor affinity , less inflammatory , may even pro-apoptotic compare PGE2 . As , may ratio ARA EPA DHA rather absolute level marine-derived n-3 PUFAs contribute towards antiproliferative pro-apoptotic effect . The ratio ARA EPA + DHA manipulate fish oil supplementation , however ; genetic factor may play key role determine ratio . Recent genome-wide association haplotype study demonstrate 28 % additive variance tissue level ARA explain variant single gene , fatty acid desaturase 1 ( FADS1 ) . FADS1 rate-limiting enzyme conversion linoleic acid ( LA ) , commonly consume PUFA , ARA , homozygotes T allele ( population frequency 13 % , HapMap -CEU ) rs174537 low fatty acid desaturase activity subsequently low tissue level ARA . While EPA produce vivo α-linolenic acid , human , process extremely inefficient tissue level EPA derive directly dietary consumption fatty fish . Thus , high activity FAD1 subsequently increase tissue level ARA may offset potential benefit dietary supplementation fish oil . To date , previously publish study investigate genetic variant influence fatty acid desaturase activity might modify beneficial effect fish oil supplementation . The investigator hypothesis individual genetically determine low activity FADS1 derive great benefit fish oil supplementation individual higher FADS1 activity lower tissue level ARA subsequently favorable ARA EPA + DHA ratio . To test hypothesis investigator recruit 150 participant recently identify adenomatous polyp conduct 6-month double blind 3 X 2 factorial randomize controlled trial . The first factor rs174537 genotype ( GG , GT , TT ) FADS1 gene second factor fish oil supplementation ( fish oil versus placebo ) . The primary study outcome change baseline rectal epithelial cell proliferation measure Ki-67 label rectal crypt apoptosis measure TUNEL . Secondary endpoint include rectal epithelial cell expression COX-2 15-PGDH , rectal cell production PGE2 PGE3 , rectal cell fatty acid concentration , well , change baseline biomarkers inflammation ( C-reactive protein ) , adipokines ( leptin , adiponectin ) , marker insulin sensitivity ( HOMA-IR ) . The Specific Aims research proposal : 1. determine efficacy fish oil supplement rectal epithelial cell proliferation index marker rectal crypt apoptosis ; , 2. determine effect genetically determine fatty acid desaturase activity fish oil supplementation marker colorectal cancer risk . The investigator long-term objective determine genetic factor might influence efficacy fish oil supplementation order conduct definitive adenoma recurrence trial use marine-derived n-3 PUFAs . The investigator anticipate fish oil anti-neoplastic effect individual low FADS1 activity great response compare individual high FADS1 activity . This study first investigate nutrigenomics fish oil supplementation colorectal cancer chemoprevention may implications beyond cancer prevention fish oil actively investigate anti-inflammatory effect cardiovascular psychiatric disease well diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome . 2 . Recruitment Retention The investigator identify eligible participant base inclusion criterion review study data medical record data collect Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study ( TCPS ) . Participants still eligible record review mail introductory letter invite participate . One week letter mail ; train interviewer Vanderbilt Survey Research Shared Resource ( SRSR ) call potential participant provide detailed information study , answer question study , see may interested participating . At time , appointment make participant baseline in-person visit . After initial visit inform consent obtain interviewer SRSR conduct baseline interview survey 24-hour dietary recall . At baseline visit , investigator re-genotype rs174535 confirm accuracy imputation process . This strategy allow investigator efficiently accurately identify appropriate candidate study . Eligible subject present Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) initial visit baseline study procedure . Participants eligible study provide write consent enrollment blood obtain ; adipose tissue biopsy perform , undergoes baseline rectal mucosal biopsy procedure . Treatment assignment obtain Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy coordinator . The first dose study medication give patient initial visit date time record . This date time consider time randomization . 3 . Randomization Randomization perform accord permute block randomization scheme stratify three genotype . Randomization proceed within three stratum block size balance interval , vary randomly accord outcome computer generate random number . This ensure cumulative proportion assignment treatment balance block assignment make . 4 . Study Procedures 1 . Data Collection Because outside dietary exposure n-6 n-3 PUFAs could possibly confound effect fish oil supplementation investigator perform total four 24-hour dietary recall study participant course study . At enrollment , investigator conduct two 24-hour dietary assessment , one weekday one weekend , participant ' diet may differ base day week . In addition investigator conduct one 24-hour dietary recall week 8 week 16 . The investigator use data collect 24-hour dietary assessment along standard food composition table calculate dietary exposure PUFAs . The investigator determine adherence study drug in-person visit study . Medication medication change record visit . Patients initiate new NSAID study withdrawn exit visit perform . Adherence fish oil also determine RBC phospholipid membrane fatty acid analysis perform month 3 month 6 . In addition , determine whether fish oil supplementation also influence fatty acid membrane concentration target tissue , investigator determine change rectal epithelial cell phospholipid membrane fatty acid concentration . 2 . Fish oil Capsules Participants allocate fish oil supplementation instruct take three Lovaza® capsule contain 465 mg EPA 375 mg DHA daily ; provide total daily dose 1395 mg EPA plus 1125 mg DHA total daily dose fish oil 2.5 gram . Patients take one tablet three time day meal . Lovaza® capsule FDA approve preparation fish oil , , quality drug monitor assure . Pharmacological grade fish oil capsule advantage provide high concentration PUFAs , low level contaminant , mercury , almost fish odor . 3 . Placebo Capsules The investigator use oleic acid placebo . The reason use oleic acid several-fold . First , oleic acid ( olive oil ) capsule similar texture , size , color , consistency fish oil capsule . More importantly , oleic acid undergo conversion eicosanoid metabolically active product . This opposed corn oil , also use placebo fish oil study primarily linoleic acid could subsequently increase tissue level ARA confound result study . Oleic acid use placebo several prior study fish oil supplementation well tolerate . 4 . Assessment Visits Patients attend GCRC clinic baseline ( initial visit ) , 3 month study treatment ( mid-point visit ) , 6 month study treatment ( end visit ) . The study coordinator contact participant every 4 week course study encourage adherence study protocol . At 3-month 6-month visit , compliance treatment monitor capsule count measurement RBC phospholipid fatty acid concentration . Adverse event record visit . 5 . Data management quality control The Vanderbilt GCRC Informatics Core use central location data processing analysis . Vanderbilt University develop software tool workflow methodology electronic collection management research study data . ( 132 ) REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) secure , web-based application provide intuitive interface user enter validate data remotely ( automate data type range check ) , data manipulation audit trail reporting , export mechanism end-of-study export data common statistical package .</detailed_description>
