	<brief_title>Continuous Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnoea common problem sleep-disordered breathing . It affect least four percent male two percent female adult population . It associate excessive daytime sleepiness , cause significant disturbance daytime routine affect work , social life memory ; untreated , also cause significant cardiovascular metabolic risk . The best available treatment obstructive sleep apnoea continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . However , everyone eligible tolerates treatment require sleep nasal full-face mask connect tube machine . Although CPAP recommend National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) moderate-severe sleep apnoea , approximately one third sleep apnoea patient CPAP stop therapy within five year . Mild sleep apnoea currently treat mandibular advancement splint generic sleep hygiene advice . Continuous transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( CTES ) submental region activate muscle dilate upper airway . This airway obstruction occur sleep apnoea . It show CTES night short period ( 10minutes ) effectively stimulate genioglossus muscle , strong pharyngeal dilator reduce upper airway obstruction , work breathe neural respiratory drive patient sleep apnoea . The London Respiratory Muscle Groups , base within King ` Health Partners Royal Brompton Hospital , develop CTES stimulator device . This device sense apnoeas snore delivers CTES normal ventilation restore . We propose undertake randomize , double-blinded , sham-controlled cross-over trial sleep apnoea patient evaluate efficacy method . Patients randomly assign night CTES sham-stimulation . The primary outcome measure number oxygen desaturations per hour ( ODI ) cause apnoeas secondary outcome measure sleepiness , measure Epworth sleepiness score , apnoea-hypopnoea-index ( AHI ) comfort , assess visual analogue score . The sample size Calculation use data publish pilot study reveal study would require 44 patient enrol . The mean study duration outcome assess patient four week . We plan commence study winter 2012/13 period two year , include analysis publication , conclude December 2014 .</detailed_description>
