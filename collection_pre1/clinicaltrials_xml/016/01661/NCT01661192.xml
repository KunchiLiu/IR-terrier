	<brief_summary>At previous study investigator assess safety efficacy treatment AAT ( Alpha 1 Antitrypsin ) newly diagnose type 1 diabetes subject aim beta cell preservation . Since treatment AAT expect chronic treatment ; stop treatment probably result eventual loss preserve beta-cell function . Indeed , investigational drug aim beta cell preservation show patient initially treat maintained initial beta-cell function , require continuation treatment lose beta-cell function . Therefore , extension study , patient previously treat AAT maintain clinically significant beta-cell function offer continuation treatment , since likely benefit use medication . The propose study aim assess long term effect AAT subject type 1 diabetes mellitus : safety tolerability treatment , effect beta-cell function . Subjects complete visit 008 study offer participate extension study . The study consist two main arm follow : Arm 1 : Subjects maintain peak stimulate C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L continue treatment AAT 18 treatment accord dosage group allocate 008 study . Arm 2 : Subjects maintain peak stimulate C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2nmol/L subject peak stimulate C -peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L reluctant receive additional study drug . Clinical follow subject arm 3 year</brief_summary>
