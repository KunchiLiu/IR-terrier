	<brief_summary>The purpose study analyze long-term outcome surgical treatment idiopathic scoliosis curve pattern treat either anterior posterior procedure . In addition , analyze long-term outcome non-operative idiopathic scoliosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Outcomes Database Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . The first aim Database Registry maintain prospective multicenter series patient treat surgically adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . Patients multiple scoliosis center around U.S. , well center Germany , enrol comprehensive analysis curve pattern treat , well type surgery perform . The outcome surgical treatment analyze . This allow frequency various curve type determine , well frequency various surgical approach utilized curve pattern . 2 . The second aim determine operative outcome vary base surgical approach utilized scoliosis correction . In analysis , anticipate specific approach identify appropriate give scoliotic curve pattern . In addition , variation within individual curve pattern analyze , specific variation surgical approach ( e.g. , distal level instrumentation , hook versus screw , hook pattern , etc ) . 3 . The third aim develop algorithm guide surgical decision making base scoliosis curve classification scheme allow surgeon provide best overall outcome ( radiographic , functional , cosmetic ) give patient idiopathic scoliosis . 4 . The fourth aim evaluate long-term outcome surgical intervention patient population . 5 . The fifth aim maintain prospective multi-center series patient idiopathic scoliosis undergone surgical correction deformity . The long-term outcome patient population compare surgical patient population . 6 . The sixth aim develop guide help clinician make decision optimal surgical treatment AIS curve base patient-specific 3D information . 7 . Factors may influence intra post-operative course also evaluate . Of particular interest patient specific factor ( curve size , pre op characteristic blood work PFT test ) influence intra-operative blood loss .</detailed_description>
