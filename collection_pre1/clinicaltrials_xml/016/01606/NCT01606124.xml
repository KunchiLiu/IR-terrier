	<brief_title>Polyphenon E Treating Patients With High-Risk Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether POLYE ( Polyphenon E ) treatment associate significant percent decrease number rectal Aberrant Crypt Foci ( ACF ) ( % change ACF ) identify pre-intervention post-intervention chromoendoscopy exam . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relative tolerability safety treatment 2 capsule POLYE take twice day mouth ( Note : capsule Polyphenon E contain approximately 200 mg epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) versus placebo administer 6 month . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect study drug vs. placebo EGCG level plasma correlate EGCG level drug compliance toxicity . II . To characterize ACF base four criterion correlate characterization intervention ( vs placebo ) , well explore natural history ACF 6 month person high risk colorectal cancer randomize placebo . III . To correlate 6-month measurement ACF size ( e.g. , number crypts/ACF ) , number , morphology , histopathology adenoma recurrence data next surveillance endoscopy . IV . To assess caffeine black tea consumption via Beverage Consumption Questionnaire correlate study endpoint . V. To assess effect POLYE versus placebo focus panel tissue biomarkers use re- post-intervention biopsy sample obtain ACF normal-appearing rectal mucosa . Residual tissue store analysis . VI . To study association clinical ( toxicity and/or ACF response activity ) pharmacokinetic parameter , and/or biologic ( pharmacodynamic ) result . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive Polyphenon E orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID . Courses arm repeat every 28 day 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
