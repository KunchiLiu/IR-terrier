	<brief_summary>The clinical benefit resection primary tumour patient synchronous unresectable metastasis know . In literature study usually describe retrospective select patient synchronous metastasis treat without resection primary tumour . All study bias patient selection prospective randomize study topic . In patient absent symptom primary tumour , argument favour initial resection present , therefore randomized trial warrant . Although recent publication suggest resection primary tumour synchronous metastasize colon cancer patient might necessary , appear base feasibility clinical outcome . Several study compare large group patient without resection primary tumour suggest improve survival primary tumour resect . A potential benefit resection primary tumour prevent complication primary tumour chemotherapy treatment later stag disease . A recent analysis CAIRO CAIRO2 data show metastatic colon cancer patient resection primary tumour prior study entry , improve survival compare patient without resection primary tumour . However , patient select primary tumour resect therefore result correct surgical morbidity mortality . The investigator propose randomize trial order demonstrate resection primary tumour improve overall survival .</brief_summary>
