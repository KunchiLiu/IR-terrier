	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1. develop test integrate self care intervention Heart Failure ( HF ) patient Diabetes ( DM ) effect patient outcomes include health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) , physical function health resource utilization . 2. ass cost cost effectiveness intervention . The intervention design go beyond usual care provide separate Heart Failure ( HF ) Diabetes ( DM ) patient education educate HF-DM patient integrate self care self management related HF-DM diet , HF-DM medication-taking behavior , physical activity , HF-DM symptom monitoring management . An integrate self care intervention compare HF-DM patient receive intervention receive usual care-attention control effect patient outcome , self care process measure , health care utilization . If effective , intervention lead improve self care , improve quality life , reduce health care resource use cost . This study facilitate great understand self care within context two chronic illness lead directly improve clinical practice future research comorbid self care Heart Failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize participant receive Heart Failure Diabetes ( HF-DM ) self-care intervention report great Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) Minnesota Living HF Questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) , Audit Diabetes-dependent Quality Life ( ADDQoL ) , EuroQol ( EQ5D ) Usual Care ( UC-AC ) group 6 month control age , gender , NYHA Class . Secondly , participant receive Heart Failure Diabetes ( HF-DM ) self-care intervention demonstrate improve physical function indicator ( BNP level , HgA1c , 6MWT ) 6 month UC-AC group control age , gender , BMI , NYHA Class comorbid condition . Thirdly , participant receive Heart Failure Diabetes ( HF-DM ) self-care intervention exhibit great improvement : HF knowledge DM knowledge UC-AC 6 month . Participants receive integrated HF-DM self-care intervention report great improvement HF self-efficacy DM self-efficacy UC-AC 6 month . HF-DM patient randomize integrated self-care intervention exhibit great improvement overall HF DM self-care behavior HF-DM diet physical activity UC-AC 6 month . Lastly , HF-DM patient receive integrate self-care intervention exhibit less health resource use associate cost ( direct health care cost provider visit , hospitalization , ED visit , length stay , direct non-health care cost associate HRU intervention ) 6 month receive UC-AC control comorbidity insurance status .</detailed_description>
