	<brief_title>Influence Chemotherapy Gamma-delta T Cells Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer associate high mortality rate . Treatment ovarian cancer currently base surgery chemotherapy . The first surgery radical surgical procedure aim achieve residual disease . Patients could benefit first surgery may offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy new surgical procedure 3 6 chemotherapy cycle . Chemotherapy currently base Taxol Carboplatin . Immunotherapy base Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell could provide promise therapeutic strategy , however , impact chemotherapy expansion functional ability Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell never evaluate . We want study effect chemotherapy ovarian cancer Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell rate peripheral blood patient ovarian cancer . Functional ability Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell study : expansion chemotherapy cytotoxic ability autologous context chemotherapy . The long term goal give rational combine conventional treatment ovarian cancer non-conventional treatment immunotherapy base Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell .</detailed_description>
