	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy sirukumab measure reduction sign symptom rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient active RA unresponsive intolerant treatment anti-TNF-alpha agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CNTO 136 ( Sirukumab ) , Human Anti-IL-6 Monoclonal Antibody , Administered Subcutaneously , Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Anti-TNF-Alpha Therapy ( SIRROUND-T )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign treatment group , study personnel know identity treatment give . Some patient receive placebo , resemble medication , contain active substance . This help determine study agent effective . Patients receive placebo sirukumab injection skin . The expected duration study 68 week , include 52 week treatment . Participants complete participation study eligible inclusion long term extension study enrollment participate site available . If participate long-term study , continue safety follow-up approximately 16 week . The placebo-controlled portion study Week 24 , placebo patient cross one two sirukumab dose regimen . Patient safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
