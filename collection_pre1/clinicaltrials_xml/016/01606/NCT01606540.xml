	<brief_summary>It believe painkiller ( NSAID drug ) slow bone heal knowledge base experimental study animal whose result automatically translated human . The purpose examine whether drug slow bone heal relationship different bone examination , scan osteoporosis , bone marker laboratory test , radiological control histology newly form bone microscope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-steroid Antiinflammatory Drugs Heal Colles Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One popular painkiller world know NSAID ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) . Many study animal make show clear tendency delay bone heal take NSAIDs . It know early intake NSAIDs prevents ectopic ossification patient , receive total hip prosthesis . However , case prosthetic loosening instability 10 year almost exclusively observed group patient receive NSAIDs postoperatively . However , clinical study still show tendency . In study include patient fresh fracture wrist ; Colles fracture . The fracture may seem unstable lack bone healing . These fracture common orthopaedic clinic . Although dislocation fragment , newly form bone weaker demonstrate DEXA scanning ( bone mineral density measurement ) . Histological examination heal bone give definitive answer whether bone affect . Thus , possibility study NSAIDs affect bone heal human clinical significance positive .</detailed_description>
