	<brief_summary>The primary aim prospective longitudinal observational outcome study compare 18 month functional outcome health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) patient undergoing salvage versus amputation follow severe distal tibia , ankle and/or foot fracture major soft tissue , bone and/or ankle articular surface loss . Functional outcome HRQoL measure use well establish self report measure , include Veterans Rand Health Survey ( VR-12 ) Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment ( SMFA ) . Hypothesis 1 : As group , salvage patient severe distal tibia , ankle and/or foot injury major soft tissue , bone and/or ankle articular surface loss similar functional outcome HRQoL undergo transtibial amputation ( within 6 week injury ) . Hypothesis 2 : The subgroup salvage patient either ( 1 ) soft tissue injury require tissue transfer ; ( 2 ) articular damage require arthrodesis ankle joint ; ( 3 ) bone loss distal tibia ankle well functional outcome HRQoL undergo transtibial amputation ( within 6 week injury ) .</brief_summary>
