	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy PC-A11 Patients With Recurrent Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 650 000 new case head neck cancer diagnose worldwide year ( 2 ) . Europe alone , estimate approximately 143 000 new case 68 000 death year ( 3 ) . The vast majority ( &gt; 90 % ) head neck malignancies squamous cell carcinoma . Most ( 60-70 % ) patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) present loco regionally advanced disease ( 2 ) . Standard treatment option SCCHN include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy . Single-modality treatment surgery radiotherapy generally recommend 40 % patient present stage I II disease . Each two modality result similar survival cure rate range 60 % 90 % ( 3 ) . For 60 % patient present locally advanced disease diagnosis , combine modality therapy generally recommend . For patient unresectable disease current standard treatment concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation . This also standard patient resectable disease organ preservation desire , adjuvant treatment , patient high-risk pathological finding surgical resection . Despite approach , substantial percentage patient ( 20-30 % ) develop local and/or regional recurrence distant metastasis ( 3 ) . Recurrent disease often resectable , even resectable case , patient decline surgical procedure due quality life consideration . Additionally , recurrent disease radiation tolerance normal tissue make re-irradiation technically challenge frequently toxic initial course ( 4 ) . The prognosis patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN generally poor , median survival 6-9 month ( 5 ) . The therapeutic ratio recurrent SCCHN narrow . Therefore , large unmet medical need novel treatment patient group , lengthen overall survival , improve patient ' quality life</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Study eligibility review approve interdisciplinary hospital team . 2 . Age minimum 18 year . 3 . Histologically cytological confirm diagnosis recurrent metastatic SCCHN consider unsuitable surgery radiotherapy ( patient distant regional metastatic disease may eligible local palliation need ) 4 . Performance status ( WHO scale/ECOG ) ≤ 1 . 5 . At least one measurable target lesion baseline . 6 . Local disease include margin ( 0.5 cm ) treatable superficial and/or interstitial laser light application ( superficial lesion : entire tumour assessable laser light application/interstitial treatment : insertion implant feasible ) 7 . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . 8 . Written informed consent . Exclusion criterion : Prior Treatment : 1 . Local treatment SCCHN surgery within previous 4 week radiation within previous 3 month . 2 . Previous treatment systemic chemotherapy SCCHN within last 4 week 3 . Previous treatment Photodynamic Therapy within last 6 month . 4 . Prior treatment bleomycin . 5 . Prior treatment PCA11 . 6 . Toxicities incur result previous anticancer therapy ( radiation therapy , chemotherapy , surgery ) resolve ≤ grade 2 . Current Treatment : 7 . Current recent ( within 30 day first study treatment ) treatment another investigational drug participation another investigational study . 8 . Other concurrent anticancer therapy . 9 . Treatment medicinal product know potential drugdrug interaction bleomycin Amphinex . Haematology , coagulation biochemistry : 10 . Inadequate bone marrow function : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) : &lt; 1.5 x 109/L , platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L haemoglobin &lt; 6 mmol/L . 11 . Inadequate liver function , define : Serum ( total ) bilirubin &gt; 2 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) institution . Aspartate Amino Transferase ( ASAT ) Alanine Amino Transferase ( ALAT ) &gt; 2.5 x ULN . Alkaline phosphatase level &gt; 2.5 x ULN . 12 . Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30ml/min . 13 . Clinical significant electrolyte abnormality ( Potassium , Magnesium , Phosphate great CTCAE grade 3 low high value ) Other : 14 . Tumours know suspected erode major blood vessel , e.g . carotid artery ( interna /or communis ) adjacent illumination site ( minimum distance tumour tissue critical structure 0.5 cm ) . 15 . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma . 16 . Conditions contraindicate bleomycin treatment ( current lung infection , severely impaired pulmonary function ) exclude lung function test ( either formal lung function test patient able undertake assessment , suitable opinion appropriately trained Respiratory / Anaesthetic Clinical Specialist ) . 17 . Conditions worsen expose light ( include porphyria ) . 18 . Inability undergo CT MRI . 19 . Pregnancy lactation ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior study PCA11 treatment start , within 14 day follow confirmatory urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior study treatment start . 20 . For female patient childbearing potential ( define &lt; 2 year last menstruation surgically sterile ) male patient surgically sterile female partner childbearing potential : absence highly effective method contraception result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) . These method contraception accord note guidance nonclinical safety study conduct human trial pharmaceutical ( CPMP/ICH/286/95 , modification ) include consistent correct use hormone contain implant injectables , combine oral contraceptive , hormone contain intrauterine device , surgical sterilization , sexual abstinence vasectomy . Note : Abstinence acceptable true abstinence : line prefer usual lifestyle subject , periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 21 . Planned surgery , endoscopic examination dental treatment first 30 day PCA11 treatment . 22 . Coexisting ophthalmic disease likely require slitlamp examination within first 90 day PCA11 treatment . 23 . Congestive heart failure NYHA Class III IV . Cardiac arrhythmia ( except atrioventricular block type I , Mobitz type II , Wenckebach type ) sign symptom relevant cardiovascular disease . 24 . Known allergy sensitivity photosensitisers . 25 . Ataxia telangiectasia 26 . Concomitant malignant disease , exception adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma nonmelanomatous skin cancer , insitu carcinoma uterine cervix . 27 . Evidence medical condition ( psychiatric illness , infectious disease , physical examination laboratory finding ) may interfere plan PCA11 treatment , affect patient compliance place patient high risk treatmentrelated complication .</criteria>
