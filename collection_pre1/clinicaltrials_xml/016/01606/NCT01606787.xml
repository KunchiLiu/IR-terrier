	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine medication call mannitol , help kidney maintain function kidney surgery . Mannitol use cause increase urine production ( diuretic ) . For many year , mannitol give patient hope would improve kidney 's circulation , reduce impact surgery kidney . Mannitol give surgery blood supply kidney stop . The blood supply kidney stop order minimize blood loss removal tumor , also assist surgeon view kidney anatomy . Once tumor remove blood supply kidney resume . Sometimes side effect temporary reduction blood supply kidney loss kidney function . This may happen either short term ( right away ) long term ( month year later ) . In study do animal , mannitol able lessen damage kidney function . However , human study ever confirm mannitol helpful effect human . There suggestion may effect . Because sufficient research yet do human , many surgeon give mannitol . A recent study , conduct Memorial Sloan Kettering look back patient undergone partial nephrectomy , operation portion kidney contain tumor remove enables normal , unaffected portion kidney preserve . The result study demonstrated significant difference kidney function investigator compare patient give mannitol . The investigator hope study help clarify effectiveness mannitol kidney function . During surgery remove kidney tumor , patient receive either mannitol placebo . A placebo , harmless medication effect . The impact mannitol compare placebo assess routine blood test image ( kidney scan ) 6 month surgery .</brief_summary>
