	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect vaccine therapy cyclophosphamide treat patient stage II-III breast cancer stage II-IV ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving vaccine therapy cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Stage II-III Breast Stage II-IV Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety administer one cycle cyclophosphamide six subsequent monthly vaccination peptide-based vaccine target folate receptor ( FR ) -alpha ( multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine ) . II . To assess ability vaccination protocol elicit immune response measure activated FR-alpha-specific T lymphocytes high-affinity antibody . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine FR-alpha expression status primary tumor available formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded material whether expression correlate ability generate immune response . II . To identify human lymphocyte antigen ( HLA ) class I bind peptide FR-alpha recognize lymphocytes patient prior vaccination . III . To determine whether cyclophosphamide treatment , prior vaccination , result regulatory T cell depletion assess regulatory T cell immediately cyclophosphamide treatment . IV . To compare FR-alpha ( FRa ) expression level tumor remove primary surgery FRa expression level tumor remove clinical purpose disease recurrence . ( For ovarian cancer patient whose disease recurs . ) OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 15-21 course 1 . Within 3-5 day , patient receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Vaccine treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
