	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic heart failure ( CHF ) often refer exercise intolerance , mark fatigue dyspnea low exercise intensity . This characteristic feature might generate respiratory skeletal muscle dysfunction , itÂ´s describe comorbid status , reflect systemic impact heart failure . Despite availability effective pharmacologic treatment , patient CHF continue experience progressively worsen symptom , frequent hospital admission premature death . Reduced physical functioning , role limitation , lack energy may interfere daily activity condition worsen thereby severely reduce quality life CHF patient . The ACCF/AHA Guidelines diagnosis management heart failure recommend exercise training adjunctive approach improve clinical status stable adult patient current prior symptom heart failure reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction . A wide variety study focus respiratory muscle abnormality CHF patient . Reduced strength endurance respiratory muscle currently recognize additional factor implicate limited exercise response quality life , well poor prognosis . Additionally , inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) show result improvement inspiratory strength , functional capacity , ventilatory response exercise , recovery oxygen uptake kinetics , quality life CHF patient respiratory muscle weakness . The optimal training scheme remain still define . Most clinical trial demonstrate effectiveness low-intensity IMT ( maximum 38 cmH2O ) , little information training effect use high training load . Our research group demonstrate short-time high-intensity respiratory training patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease afford reach good functional result short time , affords make efficient term time rehabilitation program reach patient .</detailed_description>
