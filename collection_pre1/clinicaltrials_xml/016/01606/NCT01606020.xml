	<detailed_description>The effect sleep deprivation ( SD ) performance , contradictory first glance , reality rather clear exercise duration consider , i.e . intense/supramaximal vs. prolonged exercise . This latter type exercise lead important performance decrement SD . However , cause accentuate fatigability endurance exercise sleep deficit know . Several hypothesis propose low pH exercise , low ventilation due depreciate response hypercapnia/hypoxia , haemodilution . Yet plausible explanation lower tolerance prolonged exercise SD increase rate perceive exertion . Another potential effect SD alteration central command exercise . The literature rather scarce topic base animal study . In human , effect SD maximal strength report maximal voluntary activation theory alter . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) , allow induce motor response cortical origin ( measure result contraction ) , promise tool explore neuromuscular function . TMS use three study SD , none involve exercise none measure mechanical response ( i.e . EMG response , motor evoke potential , measure ) . In addition , result three study contradictory . The effect SD central fatigue ( i.e . increase activation deficit exercise ) never investigate . The goal experiment thus test hypothesis increase central fatigue ( supraspinal level ) SD participate performance alteration prolong exercise . For purpose , measurement neuromuscular function particularly dedicate assess central fatigue perform SD also combine SD fatigue exercise conduct exhaustion .</detailed_description>
