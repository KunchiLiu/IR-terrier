	<brief_summary>Rationale : Ischaemic preconditioning ( IP ) refers reduction ischemia-reperfusion injury induce brief preceding period ischemia . Also arterial endothelium protect IP . Several study perform animal human demonstrate protective effect IP attenuate age . However , previous study directly examine underlying mechanisms observation . Possibly , reduce protective effect IP age relates direct effect endothelium , consequently lead attenuate ability IP prevent endothelial dysfunction ischaemia reperfusion injury . Several previous study fail demonstrate ability pharmacological stimulus mimic beneficial effect IP age vessel . Restoration age-related reduction effectiveness IP may possible exercise training . In aged animal , physical training restores efficacy ischemic preconditioning . Indirect evidence indicate physical activity , independent cardiovascular risk factor , protects occurrence well severity myocardial infarction human . Although suggests physical activity may beneficially influence age-related reduction IP , previous study provide direct evidence hypothesis . Objective : To examine impact age physical fitness ability ischaemic preconditioning protect endothelial damage response ischaemia reperfusion injury healthy human . A secondary objective explore role Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signal induction IP young old subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease become worldwide burden . In Netherlands 40.000 person die annually due coronary artery disease , either acute myocardial infarction heart failure.1 Through plaque formation negative vascular remodelling , significant stenotic lesion develop coronary artery subsequently limit coronary blood flow ultimately cause ischemic event . Reperfusion therapy ( either pharmacologic , endovascular surgical ) mandatory salvage ischemic tissue . However , reperfusion several deleterious event take place causing damage . Murry find ischemia reperfusion injury ( IR-injury ) could reduce phenomenon call ischemic preconditioning.2 Short last repetitive episode ischemia prior ischemic event induce tissue tolerance IR-injury . After discovery phenomenon , ample research devote elucidation underling protective mechanism , also factor improve impair ability phenomenon protect artery ischaemia reperfusion injury . Several study perform animal human demonstrate protective effect IP attenuate age . Much work perform animal model human vitro study . Interestingly , previous study directly examine underlying mechanism observation human use vivo technique . One potential explanation age-related reduction protective effect IP relate direct effect endothelium . Much scientific effort devote develop human vivo model study ischemia reperfusion injury . Recently , publication emerge use flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) brachial radial artery sustain ischaemic stimulus ( 20 minute ) establish presence blunt endothelial function ischaemia reperfusion injury.3 , 4 This effect reperfusion injury endothelial function abrogate ischemic preconditioning.3 Endothelial dysfunction acknowledge first ( subclinical ) manifestation atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease.5 , 6 It significantly correlate occurrence myocardial infarction stroke.6 Assessment flow mediate dilation brachial artery measure endothelial ( dy ) function , validate model research effect possible protective strategies3 , 4 perform mechanistic experiments4 , 7 , 8 IR-injury human vivo . Several previous study fail demonstrate ability pharmacological stimulus mimic beneficial effect IP age vessels.9 Restoration age-related reduction effectiveness IP may possible exercise training . Indirect evidence indicate physical activity , independent cardiovascular risk factor , protects occurrence well severity myocardial infarction humans.10 Although suggests physical activity may beneficially influence age-related reduction IP , previous study provide direct evidence hypothesis human . In cross-sectional observational experiment study impact age ( young versus old subject ) physical fitness ( sedentary versus train old subject ) protective effect ischaemic precondition brachial artery endothelial function ischaemia-reperfusion injury healthy human vivo . We hypothesize age associate attenuated ability ischaemic preconditioning prevent decrease brachial artery endothelial function observe ischaemia reperfusion injury . Moreover , expect age-related reduction effectiveness ischaemic preconditioning prevent endothelial dysfunction reperfusion injury ( least partly ) preserve trained old subject .</detailed_description>
