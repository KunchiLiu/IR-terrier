	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) crizotinib administer orally twice daily combination topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) cyclophosphamide child refractory/relapsed solid tumor anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . II . To define describe toxicity crizotinib combination topotecan cyclophosphamide administer schedule . III . To estimate recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) crizotinib administer orally twice daily combination vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane child refractory/relapsed solid tumor ALCL . IV . To define describe toxicity crizotinib combination vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane administer schedule . V. To characterize pharmacokinetics crizotinib child refractory cancer combine either topotecan cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity crizotinib combination either topotecan cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane within confines Phase 1 study . II . To preliminarily examine relationship anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) status patient neuroblastoma ALCL response crizotinib combination either topotecan cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane . III . To preliminarily examine relationship minimal residual disease ( MRD ) status clinical response crizotinib combination either topotecan cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin/dexrazoxane patient ALCL . IV . To use questionnaire gather preliminary information palatability oral solution formulation crizotinib . V.To examine ALK c-Met expression , copy number mutation status archival tumor tissue solid tumor ALCL patient . VI . To use questionnaire gather information acceptability crizotinib capsule formulation . VII . To use questionnaire gather information acceptability crizotinib microsphere formulation . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study crizotinib . Patients assign part A , part B , part C base treat physician 's choice availability reservation . Part A : Patients receive crizotinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , cyclophosphamide IV daily ( QD ) day 1-5 , topotecan hydrochloride IV QD day 1-5 , filgrastim pegfilgrastim begin day 6 continue blood count recovers . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part B : Patients receive crizotinib PO BID part A . Patients also receive vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV day 1 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 , filgrastim pegfilgrastim begin day 2 continue blood count recovers . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part C : Patients receive crizotinib capsule formulation orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , cyclophosphamide IV daily ( QD ) day 1-5 , topotecan hydrochloride IV QD day 1-5 , filgrastim pegfilgrastim begin day 6 continue blood count recovers . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Part D : Patients receive crizotinib microsphere formulation orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , cyclophosphamide IV daily ( QD ) day 1-5 , topotecan hydrochloride IV QD day 1-5 , filgrastim pegfilgrastim begin day 6 continue blood count recovers . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
