	<brief_summary>Surgical therapy gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) hiatal hernia ( HH ) achieve outcomes afford patient lifelong satisfaction . The published result obtain surgery may consider definitive relation length follow-up patient ' life expectancy . The real recurrence rate result surgery GERD difficult ass due lack serial time point follow-up . Further bias may introduce analysis lack appropriate control . The result surgical therapy type II-IV HH even controversial high rate anatomical relapse different method follow-up adopt report case series . Aim study clarify value surgical therapy type II-IV HH . The investigator report patient follow surgery various time point course 30 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up Patients Operated Upon Type II-IV Hiatal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We review chart patient underwent primary surgery type II-IV Hiatal Hernia period January 1980 - December 2010 . Pre-operatively , patient routinely underwent symptom assessment , barium swallow , upper GI endoscopy esophageal manometry . The principle surgery GERD hiatal hernia involve full isolation diaphragmatic pillar E-G junction , full isolation resection sac fat pad mediastinum ( except fat close less curvature , preserve integrity vagus nerve ) , evaluation degree esophageal shortening , Collis gastroplasty case short esophagus . Post-operatively , patient participate free-of-charge outpatient follow-up program 6 month , 12 month every year 5 year . The length follow-up calculated day surgery day patient underwent last complete follow-up . The type severity symptom grade reflux esophagitis score use questionnaire semi-quantitative scale ( 0 = absence symptom esophagitis 3 = severe symptom esophagitis ) . An evaluation scale surgical result , score range `` excellent '' `` poor '' , also use .</detailed_description>
