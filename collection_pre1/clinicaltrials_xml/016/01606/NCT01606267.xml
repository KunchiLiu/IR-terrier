	<detailed_description>STUDY BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL Most low-income country make slow progress address childhood mortality - slow achieve fourth Millennium Development Goal 2015 . Countries , donor development agency respond situation redouble effort stimulate support child survival activity country , particularly Africa . The Catalytic Initiative Save Million Lives ( CI ) partnership donor agency commit accelerate progress toward MDGs 4 5 support scale-up proven high impact intervention . UNICEF Canadian International Development Agency ( CIDA ) , part CI , undertake major initiative reduce mortality among child less five year age several country sub-Saharan Africa , include Ethiopia . Ethiopia high under-five mortality rate , estimate 123 per 1000 live birth 2005 Demographic Health Survey . The country make commitment achieve MDG 4 target two-thirds reduction mortality 2015 reflect launch national Health Extension Program ( HEP ) 2004 , continue support UNICEF CI funding . The key program strategy train support approximately 30,000 Health Extension Workers ( HEWs ) provide promotive , preventive , select curative health care service community level . Previously , HEWs treat diarrhea ORS malaria rapid diagnostic kit ACTs ; pneumonia case refer health center . Ethiopia recently adopt policy expand management pneumonia among child under-five antibiotic community HEWs . This provide unique opportunity accelerate increase coverage treatment pneumonia , one great killer child under-five Ethiopia . This expansion , combine exist community management malaria , diarrhea severe acute malnutrition , refer integrate community case management ( HEP+ICCM ) largely support Catalytic Initiative CIDA UNICEF focus first stage five region country : Amhara , Benishangul-Gumaz , Oromia , SNNP Tigray . The lead strategy HEP+ICCM initiative increase capacity HEWs effectively assess , classify , manage leading cause preventable child mortality include pneumonia , malaria , diarrhea , severe acute malnutrition . In focus region , plan developed introduce CCM childhood pneumonia cotrimoxazole diarrhea ORS zinc , malaria ACTs , malnutrition therapeutic feeding . The program plan conduct refresher training HEWs supervisor , strengthen supervision , logistical support ICCM system overall . The initial implementation start August 2010 phase Oromia region . The effectiveness ICCM varies across specific country context depend strength implementation . It therefore essential evaluate effectiveness scale-up strategy provide basis future program improvement global evidence effective strategy accelerate reduction under-five mortality . OBJECTIVES The Institute International Programs Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School Public Health ( IIP-JHU ) commission CIDA UNICEF conduct independent prospective evaluation HEP+ICCM . This study objective conduct full prospective evaluation impact Ethiopian HEP+ICCM common childhood illness implement HEWs mortality nutritional status child age five . The specific objective study : . To measure effect HEP+ICCM program relative routine HEP approach country 18 month period change coverage case management common childhood illness severe acute malnutrition , reduction mortality among child age five , improvement nutritional status use rigorous evaluation design ; ii . To track program implementation input , process , output contextual factor ; iii . To measure implementation strength ass quality child health care . METHODOLOGY In Oromia region , implementation HEP+ICCM program phase allow possibility identify comparison area evaluation . The prospective evaluation use cluster randomize design stratification zone , within woredas randomly assign intervention comparison arm use restricted randomization procedure . Coverage childhood intervention measure baseline end-line midterm `` quality care implementation snapshot '' assess strength implementation . Mortality estimate intervention comparison woredas generate retrospectively end-line household survey . Program implementation contextual factor document throughout evaluation period . The evaluation focus Jimma West Hararge zone . Woredas within two evaluation zone randomly assign intervention comparison area . Intervention area refer phase 1 area comparison area refer phase 2 area . The phase 1 2 woredas randomly assign adapt , restrict randomization process , balance presence malaria , food security zone . Urban area exclude since urban HEP recent addition implement differently . In Jimma zone , seventeen woredas divide nine phase 1 woredas eight phase 2 woredas . In West Haraghe zone , seven woredas phase 1 phase 2 area . The ORHB commit least 18-month phase-in identify intervention comparison area two area . Phase 1 woredas implement HEP+ICCM Phase 2 woredas continue offer service include routine HEP . Phase 1 implementation two evaluation zone begin February 2011 , follow baseline coverage survey . DATA SOURCES Household Surveys : The primary data evaluation come baseline end-line household survey . The baseline survey conduct January - February 2011 end-line survey conduct 18 month follow end HEW train part phase one . These survey measure coverage child health intervention interest nutritional status among child five . The end-line survey include , addition coverage measure , full birth history woman 15-49 year old measure retrospectively mortality among child five . Partners report phase one implementation complete July 2011 ; therefore end-line survey plan January 2013 . For baseline survey , estimate 3,700 household ( 1850 arm ) require detect change coverage indicator baseline end-line . For end-line survey , sample size household calculate detect difference difference 20 percentage point under-five mortality intervention comparison area 80 % power . We estimate conservative sample 15,157 household arm study require , make total sample size 30,314 household . Measurement implementation strength assessment quality child health care data : A community-level survey HEWs plan provide `` snapshot '' HEP +ICCM implementation strength two evaluation zone . The data collect comprise core indicator implementation strength , well indicator demand-generation activity , utilization quality service provide HEWs . The study sample functional 104 health post intervention area 46 comparison area . Study participant include : 1 ) HEWs perform case management childhood illness , 2 ) sick child 2-59 month age present health post consultations caretaker 3 ) sick child 2-59 month community surround health post . ANALYSIS The main analysis data involve comparison trend coverage impact indicator intervention comparison arm , use appropriate statistical model adjust cluster cluster level . Adequacy implementation arm evaluation determine use data baseline survey , process documentation data implementation snapshot survey . Using data end-line survey , under-five mortality compute 18-month period baseline survey ( represent baseline under-five mortality ) 18-month period full implementation ( end-line under-five mortality ) . Precaution take measure end-line mortality period start time full implementation ( train deployment HEWs drug ) complete . Full implementation intervention woredas achieve July 2011 , six month completion baseline survey . The first level analysis ass `` intention treat '' , consist analyze data intervention comparison arm per start-up design . This analysis compare change baseline end-line under-five mortality rate well nutritional status among child under-five intervention comparison area . Difference difference analysis conduct estimate impact ICCM mortality . Proportion hazard model also apply control possible difference baseline characteristic contextual factor . An important secondary objective HEP+ICCM increase equity access high impact , cost-effective preventative curative intervention . The evaluation team ass change inequality associate implementation HEP+ICCM program intervention examine project outcomes impact across socioeconomic demographic subgroup .</detailed_description>
