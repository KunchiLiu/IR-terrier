	<brief_title>Rivastigmine Patch Veterans With Cognitive Impairment Following TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) represent one significant health risk related military duty ; rapidly become `` signature injury '' Iraq Afghanistan conflict . TBI patient often experience multiple cognitive problem , disturbance memory , attention , executive function among common . Disturbances memory well attention particularly problematic , disruption relatively basic cognitive function may exacerbate cause additional disturbance executive function , communication complex cognitive domain . These cognitive deficit , especially memory affect , significantly impact day-to-day functioning source linger disability distress affect individual . However , despite advance make TBI care , treatment cognitive deficit TBI lag behind , force clinician provide treatment without guidance evidence-based scientific data . This proposal aim begin process provide clinician evidence-based guideline pharmacological management Veterans TBI suffer persistent cognitive deficit follow injury . This aim accomplish conduct clinical trial Veterans suffer moderate severe posttraumatic memory impairment follow TBI . Specifically , proposal evaluate efficacy safety rivastigmine transdermal patch , intermediate-acting cholinesterase inhibitor , population . The investigator hypothesize rivastigmine transdermal patch effective , equally safe , placebo treatment moderate severe posttraumatic memory impairment Veterans TBI test randomize , multi-site , parallel design , placebo-controlled trial , 12-week endpoint . The exploratory hypothesis state compare placebo , rivastigmine patch effective equally safe treatment patient continue randomize , placebo-controlled phase total 26 week . To test hypothesis evaluate effect safety rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 hour ( 10cm2 ) transdermal patch 138 Veterans meet exceed criterion close , non-penetrating , mild TBI present baseline moderate severe memory impairment . Memory impairment define Total Recall index ( Trials 1-3 ) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised ( HVLT-R ) least 25 % low intelligence-adjusted expect score , assess Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition ( WAIS-IV ) Information Vocabulary subtests . The study consist screen period , one-week single-blind , placebo run-in phase , 12-week double-blind acute treatment phase ( Phase I ) . Subjects randomized 1:1 rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5mg/24 hour ( 10cm2 ) match placebo . During Phase I , initial 4-week titration period follow 8-week continuation phase . Following 12-week acute treatment phase , randomize patient continue double-blind phase ( Phase II ) additional 14 week study treatment period end . Recruitment stage end 2.25.16 . Efficacy determine compare proportion patient treatment group classify responder week 12 . Secondary measure functional capacity assess impact memory improvement real-world functioning , measure cognitive domain affect TBI , namely attention , work episodic memory executive function , well measure mood quality life examine . Study finding contribute body evidence need establish standard care Veterans posttraumatic memory impairment cognitive deficit .</detailed_description>
