	<brief_title>HIV Reverse Cholesterol Transport Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection associate low HDL-cholesterol , independent risk-factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . NNRTI-based HAART increase HDL-c , nevirapine show increase production major apolipoprotein ApoA-I . In contrast , initiation PI-based HAART lead persistently low HDL-c despite reduction HIV RNA immunologic recovery . HDL-c form reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) , process cholesterol transfer intracellular pool circulate lipoprotein eliminate liver . Accumulation intracellular cholesterol cell macrophages precursor ( circulate monocyte ) implicate atherogenesis . In vitro data suggest HIV protein Nef directly interfere cellular protein involve RCT ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 ( ABCA1 ) monocyte-derived macrophage . ABCA1 expression control peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARG ) intracellular cholesterol sensor sterol regulatory element bind protein 2 ( SREBP2 ) . In adipose tissue know PI treatment downregulates SREBP PPARG expression . Preliminary work investigator lab reproduce finding monocyte untreated HIV infection vivo demonstrate relationship gene expression ABCA1 , SREBP2 , monocyte intracellular cholesterol circulate lipoprotein . These early data suggest defect RCT determine intracellular cholesterol level HIV-infected subject whereas increase LDL-c great determinant intracellular cholesterol HIV negative subject . This suggest potentially pivotal role RCT abnormalities low HDL-c , increase intracellular cholesterol atherogenesis HIV infection . The investigator 's aim examine impact initiation ART either PI NNRTI RCT circulate monocyte vivo impact correlate change amount size circulate HDL-c .</detailed_description>
