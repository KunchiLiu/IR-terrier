	<brief_title>QUILT-3.020 : A Study ALT-801 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) plasma cell malignancy make 1 % cancer 10 % hematologic neoplasma , second commonly diagnose hematologic malignancy . There estimate 20,520 new case MM 10,610 death due MM United States . Historically , standard first-line therapy MM consist combination therapy alkylating agent , melphalan prednisone . Response rate combination therapy approximately 50 % , five-year survival rate remain low 33 % . For young patient , debulking chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) melphalan treatment choice increase potential sustain durable remission . However , large percentage patient diagnose MM suitable candidate ASCT age comorbidities . The approach MM treatment undergone radical transformation past decade introduction proteasome inhibitor , bortezomib , immunomodulatory drug ( ImiDs ) , thalidomide lenalidomide . Despite advance treatment MM , disease remain incurable due persistence minimal residual disease . Thus , novel modality complement improve current treatment option need . There ample evidence immunomodulatory drug effective myeloma . Lenalidomide thalidomide show stimulate T cell presence antigen present cell via costimulatory pathway . Also , modulation NK cell function associate anti-tumor activity observe MM patient treat lenalidomide . It demonstrate NK cell exhibit potent anti-MM activity follow IL-2 administration , ex vivo IL-2-activated intravenously administer NK cell prolong survival MM-bearing mouse . Thus demonstrate role importance NK cell treatment MM . Taken together , data suggest use potent immunotherapeutic attractive approach provide durable immune response even potentially cure patient MM . Additionally , immunotherapy well-established approach treat cancer type . One strategy receive attention treatment cytokine IL-2 enhance anti-tumor immunity . Unfortunately , considerable toxicity associate treatment make difficult achieve effective dose site tumor limit population treat . Thus , critical need innovative strategy enhance effect IL-2 , reduce toxicity without compromise clinical benefit , provide convenient dose regimen , treat diagnosis include MM . Altor Bioscience Corp. develop tumor-targeted IL-2 fusion protein , ALT-801 , comprise human recombinant IL-2 genetically link TCR domain capable bind tumor associate human p53 peptide present context HLA-A2 . Animal study indicate ALT-801 could useful therapeutic approach activate immune effector cell , bring together effector cell tumor cell stimulate immune cell-mediated activity . In addition , various mouse xenograft model , molecule increase efficacy lessens side effect high-dose rhIL-2 . Moreover , human study indicate ALT-801 give daily two 4-day cycle MTD ( i.e . 0.04 mg/kg ) well tolerate , exhibit favorable PK drug profile , exhibit immunological potency human , provide evidence clinical benefit cancer patient higher dose level ( 0.08 mg/kg ) ALT-801 monotherapy treatment associate well clinical benefit patient metastatic cancer . Also , result pre-clinical study various tumor diverse origin relevant MM model indicate ALT-801 potent immunostimulatory molecule capable increase NK cell CD8+ T cell number percentages myeloma tumor-bearing mouse , ALT-801 single multidose treatment regimens exhibits potent anti-tumor activity induce long-lasting immunologic memory well-established myeloma cell immunocompetent mouse model , suggest potential curative treatment patient MM . Based finding , ALT-801 single-agent therapeutic may provide durable clinical benefit patient relapse relapsed refractory MM . In study , establish tolerable dose level ALT-801 MM patient , estimate anti-tumor activity characterize pharmacokinetic immunogenicity profile ALT-801 patient .</detailed_description>
