	<brief_title>Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy Refractory Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine common among patient seek medical care headache . The prevalence migraine around 10 % Iran . The many study migraine pathophysiology imply brain migraine patient impaired term cerebral circulation baseline activity brain stem , monoaminergic system cortex . Then headache sign change occur brain rid hazardous condition . Based theory many electrophysiological image abnormality appear brain aura headache diminish early phase attack . It mean change concurrent headache associate quasi normalization cortical information processing . The different pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment propose migraine management . But patient satisfactorily respond tolerate current evidence-based treatment . This group patient often say refractory migraine ( RM ) . Thus accord enigmatic pathophysiology migraine , comprehensive treatment affect contribute factor migraine minimal side effect provide yet . Extremely low frequency magnetic field ( ELF MFs ) non-pharmacological treatment migraine good effect weak evidence control migraine . Recently base extensive study bioeffects low frequency electromagnetic field hope method respond many human disorder unsolvable . The purpose study apply best effective treatment protocol ELF-MF brain circulatory system extract use late finding study low-frequency electromagnetic field intervention apply refractory migraine patient form randomize one-blind placebo- control trial study . The evaluation intervention do subjectively ( migraine dairy MIDAS ) . Also consider follow period confirm result .</detailed_description>
