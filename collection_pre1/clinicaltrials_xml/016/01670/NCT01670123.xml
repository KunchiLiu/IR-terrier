	<brief_summary>This three-year intervention development proposal submit NIMH DATR Mood Disorders/Sleep Disorders Program A2-AID lead New Investigator . The goal study develop evaluate clinical utility new personalize smart-phone intervention enhance illness self-management people bipolar disorder . Bipolar disorder heterogeneous fluctuate condition lead source disability . Consistent NIMH Strategic Aim 3.2 , self-monitoring tool vital clinical management evidence-based psychosocial intervention bipolar disorder . Practice guideline state patient receive education self-monitoring identify adaptive response early warn sign symptom . Advances technology enable electronic monitoring patient-reported outcome use mobile device - assessment strategy call Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) . Using freely available software , develop preliminary version novel smart-phone intervention integrate EMA brief psychosocial intervention design people bipolar disorder . Mobile real-time intervention successfully apply chronic illness theoretical advantage clinic-based intervention motivate cue health-protective behavior . Our new intervention call Personalized Real-Time Intervention Stabilizing Mood ( PRISM ) , delivers tailor intervention content naturalistically moment symptom occur . We recently conduct small proof-of-concept study PRISM outpatient adult bipolar disorder suggest intervention feasible , present technological operational barrier , yield data corresponds clinical rating , perceive useful participant . Building preliminary work , propose develop intervention base participant feedback theoretically-driven enhancement . We conduct randomize trial ass clinical utility new intervention 12 week . Specifically , randomize sample 90 adult age 18 old Bipolar Disorder I II one two experimental condition . Participants condition participate two in-person session adapt evidence-based psychosocial intervention bipolar disorder , aim identify early warning sign adaptive response symptom fluctuation . The Control condition participate in-person session , PRISM condition also utilize smart phone device 12 week . In pilot trial , compare outcomes two condition standard clinical rating depressive manic symptom , along psychosocial functioning . We assess predictor compliance change outcomes PRISM condition inform large effectiveness trial . We use exploratory analysis refine intervention , include capitalize rich repeat measure obtain device . This study provide strong basis large effectiveness trial , along potentially useful tool enhance self-management bipolar disorder . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : Bipolar disorder lead cause disability , many people access evidence-based psychosocial intervention . Mobile device may prove effective clinic-based intervention , deliver self-management strategy moment symptom occur . To lead large effectiveness study , propose develop novel intervention use mobile technology monitor intervene symptom real-time , conduct 12-week randomize trial 90 patient evaluate acceptability short-term efficacy smart-phone base intervention bipolar disorder .</brief_summary>
