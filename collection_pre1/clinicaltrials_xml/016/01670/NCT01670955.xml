	<brief_summary>PROTOCOL FOR THE STUDY OF THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF JOBELYN , IN THE PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ANAEMIA IN GYNAECOLOGICAL PATIENTS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Jobelyn Pre-operative Management Anaemia Gynaecological Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It long known anaemia increase risk death complication patient cardiovascular surgery , result recent study show risk increase patient anaemia undergo various type surgery , include gynaecological procedure . Compared patient without anaemia , risk death within 30 day surgery 42 % high among patient anaemia . In addition , patient anemia 35 % likely experience cardiac , respiratory , urinary , wound complication well sepsis blood clot . Because even mild anaemia increase risk postoperative morbidity patient undergo major non-cardiac surgery , doctor need consider preoperative treatment anaemia possible . More research need establish efficacy , safety cost-effectiveness pre-operative anaemia management . One major clinical issue many gynaecological patient Nigeria optimize pack cell volume surgery . Anaemia could trace multiple factor notable high prevalence infection , worm infestation malnutrition ( R ) . In reduce wait time reduce morbidity mortality associate surgery , important correct pack cell volume adequately surgery . The traditional method correct PCV involve use 'routine ' haematinic Ferrous sulphate , Folic acid Multivitamin . This addition dietary advice . While efficacy drug well acknowledge clinical practice , dearth literature specific influence haematological parameter . Majority Nigerians gradually change perception traditional medicine gradual shift towards use . It believe traditional drug act faster effective orthodox drug conventional use . One area correction anaemia . Sorghum bicolor , grain long use Africa high nutritional value also exhibit strong antioxidant property antiinflammatory effect . The traditional preparation Sorghum bicolor oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) OF 37,622 micro mole TE/g . This much high botanical preparation . Complementing antioxidant property , Sorghum bicolor also exhibit anti inflammatory effect demonstrate selective COX-2 inhibition , provide effective reduction inflammation without residual side effect . Sorghum bicolor extract show increase haematocrit haemoglobin level reduce white cell count trypanosome brucei brucei induce anaemia experimental rabbit . These effect conclusive within 49 day experimentation . Animals sacrifice administration lethal dose Jobelyn show congestion liver , kidneys lung . This might result direct effect organs sign cardiotoxicity . However wide therapeutic range . Sorghum bicolor proprietary name product intend treat sickle cell disease . It exactly jobelyn currently market nutritional supplement . Jobelyn market 250mg capsule sorghum bicolor leaf extract . The product widely market United States Nigeria . Many pregnant woman use regularly long time without report adverse effect . The sorghum bicolor extract expect increase haematocrit ' pregnant woman within short time .</detailed_description>
