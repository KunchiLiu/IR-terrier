	<brief_summary>The aim study determine whether pulsed radiofrequency steroid well occipital neuralgia . Seventy-six patient ON migraine tenderness occipital nerve respond occipital nerve block ( hereafter include broad category `` ON '' ) randomize 1:1 ratio receive either corticosteroid local anesthetic injection ( n=38 ) local anesthetic PRF occipital nerve ( ) ( n=38 ) occipital neuralgia . Both patient treat &amp; evaluate physician blind . The first follow-up visit 6 week . Patients obtain significant pain relief remain study . Those patient fail obtain benefit exit study allow crossover treatment receive alternative care . The second follow-up 3 month final follow-up 6-months post-procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up 76 patient refer one participate pain clinic occipital neuralgia , migraine occipital nerve tenderness ( dual diagnosis ) randomize 1:1 ratio computer generate randomization table receive one two treatment . Treatments randomized institution . Within group , patient plain occipital neuralgia , occipital neuralgia migraine , sub-randomized 1:1 ratio . Diagnosis ON make low-volume ( &lt; 3 mL bupivacaine per nerve ) . Our criterion positive response &gt; 50 % pain relief last least 3 hour . Those individual symptoms distribution great less occipital nerve receive treatment nerve . The great occipital nerve frequently affect less nerve . Half ( n=38 ) patient allocate receive local anesthetic &amp; corticosteroid injection nerve ( group I ) , equal number allocate receive local anesthetic &amp; PRF ( group II ) . In patient request sedation , intravenous insert light sedation administer low dos midazolam fentanyl , accordance standard clinic practice . Treatment patient accomplish use 20-gauge radiofrequency needle 10 mm active tip . Prior treating , electrical stimulation perform ensure ample proximity target nerve ( ) , target threshold concordant stimulation &lt; 0.3 volt site . Once proper needle position ensure , group I receive injection nerve contain 30 mg depomethylprednisolone mix 2 mL 50:50 mixture 2 % lidocaine 0.5 % bupivacaine ( 2.75 mL ) . Anywhere 1 4 nerve inject , 4 nerve target patient bilateral lesser great occipital nerve involvement . This follow 3 cycle sham PRF 120 per cycle , slight ( approximately 30o electrode adjustment cycle . For sham PRF , electrical field heat generate ( i.e . machine set radiofrequency cycle stimulation ) , cycle time ( 120 per cycle ) adhere ( i.e . wait total 6 '' , 2 '' per cycle ) . Those patient group II receive injection nerve contain 2.75 mL solution 2 mL 50:50 2 % lidocaine 0.5 % bupivacaine + 0.75 mL saline ( 2.75 mL ) , follow 3 cycle PRF use follow standard setting : voltage output 40-60 V ; 2 Hz frequency ; 20 m pulse 1-second cycle , 120 second duration per cycle ; impedance range 150 400 Ohms ; 42o C plateau temperature . No patient prescribe additional medication therapy procedure first follow-up . However , allow remain current , stable analgesic regimen . Rescue medication consist tramadol 50 mg 1 2 tablet every 6 hour PRN ( 8/d ) and/or acetaminophen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen , diclofenac ketorolac `` need '' basis . Follow-ups perform physician blind treatment allocation . A preliminary follow-up perform week . The first full follow-up visit schedule 6-weeks start treatment . A positive outcome define &gt; 50 % decrease headache couple positive satisfaction rating ( &gt; 3 0-5 scale ) . Subjects obtain positive outcome initial 6-week follow-up visit remain study return 3-month follow-up visit . Those negative outcome exit study `` per protocol '' receive standard care . Subjects obtain positive outcome 1-month experience recurrence 3-month follow-up visit also exit study per protocol , final outcome measure record receive standard care . Those obtain positive outcome 3-months remain study final 6-month follow-up , obtain negative outcome exit study . Unblinding patient treat physician patient exit study final follow-up visit continue benefit .</detailed_description>
