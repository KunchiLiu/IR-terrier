	<brief_summary>This Phase I study combination three drug : sirolimus , cyclophosphamide , topotecan . This first study evaluate safety clinical activity combination oral sirolimus , oral cyclophosphamide oral topotecan pediatric young adult patient relapse refractory solid tumor . In phase I study , mTOR inhibitor sirolimus administer combination oral cyclophosphamide oral topotecan child relapse refractory solid tumor . The primary aim study recommend phase II dose schedule describe toxicity combination . Myelosuppression target toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus With Cyclophosphamide Topotecan Pediatric/Adolescent Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination cyclophosphamide topotecan well-tolerated provide oral therapy option heavily pre-treated patient . The toxicity profile activity level suggest combination provide useful platform onto novel compound may add . Sirolimus show demonstrate single-agent activity preclinical model rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , medulloblastoma , glioblastoma , neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma . Sirolimus also show additive effect pre-clinical model solid tumor combine cyclophosphamide . This trial therefore evaluate combination sirolimus cyclophosphamide topotecan . Pharmacokinetic study sirolimus well pharmacodynamic study assess antiangiogensis inhibition mTOR pathway do . Patients accrue dose level cohorts 3 use 3 + 3 design . Patients initially enrol dose level 1 . Patients receive daily oral sirolimus cyclophosphamide day 1 - 21 28 day cycle . This combined oral topotecan give day 1 - 14 . Sirolimus dose base steady-state plasma trough concentration goal level dose level 1 3-7.9 ng/ML goal level subsequent dose level 8-12.0 ng/ML . Dosing cyclophosphamide topotecan 25 mg/m2/dose 0.8 mg/ m2 /dose respectively dose level 1 2 . Level 3 dose escalate cyclophosphamide 50 mg/ m2/dose . If level 1 dosing tolerate , patient enrol level -1 cohort cyclophosphamide sirolimus administer day 1 - 14 . If level -1 tolerate , patient enrol level -2 topotecan administration limit day 1 - 7 .</detailed_description>
