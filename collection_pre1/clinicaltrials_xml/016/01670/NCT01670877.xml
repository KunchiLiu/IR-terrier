	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Preregistration : Histologically cytologically confirm HER2negative ( 0 1+ IHC nonamplified FISH ) breast cancer stage IV . There limitation number prior line systemic therapy . Presence measurable nonmeasurable disease RECIST 1.1 acceptable , except eligible Part II fulvestrantnaive ER+ cohort , least one measurable disease RECIST 1.1 require . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Adequate organ function define within 8 week preregistration : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN ( case know Gilbert 's syndrome , &lt; 2 x ULN allow ) AST ALT ≤3× ULN &lt; 5 ULN patient liver metastasis Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Note : HER2 mutation testing may perform patient receive active systemic therapy metastatic breast cancer result use determine eligibility study drug therapy future . Exclusion Criteria Preregistration : Testing LVEF required preregistration , patient must recent LVEF &lt; LLN symptom congestive heart failure . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Acute currently active hepatic biliary disease require antiviral therapy ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis , stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . History significant cardiac disease , cardiac risk factor , uncontrolled arrhythmia . Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease extensive tumor involvement lung result dyspnea rest . Inclusion Criteria Registration Tumor tissue test positive HER2 mutation . HER2 mutation detect Guardant360 also eligible . ECOG performance status ≤2 Adequate organ function define within 2 week registration : ANC ≥1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( case know Gilbert 's syndrome , &lt; 2 x ULN allow ) AST ALT ≤3× ULN ≤ 5 x ULN patient liver metastasis . The patient must complete radiation therapy least 1 week last systemic chemotherapy administration , adequate recovery bone marrow organ function , start neratinib . Presence disease progression recent disease evaluation . Patients know brain metastasis eligible , must receive radiation steroid stable ( without evidence disease progression image exam ) 3 month . QTc interval ≤450 msec men &lt; ≤ 470 msec woman within 2 week registration . LVEF &gt; = institutional ILLN within 4 week registration . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Men must agree commit use barrier method contraception treatment 3 month last dose investigational product . Able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . There limitation number prior line systemic therapy . To eligible Part II fulvestrantnaive ER+ cohort , prior treatment fulvestrant allow . In addition , ER and/or PR positivity institutional standard require pathology recent tumor specimen biopsy do unless tissue source ( example , pleural effusion ascites bone biopsy ) may yield false negative ER and/or PR result , case pathology early time point could use discussion study chair require . To eligible Part II fulvestranttreated ER+ cohort , prior disease progression fulvestrant require . In addition , ER and/or PR positivity institutional standard require pathology recent tumor specimen unless tissue source ( example , pleural effusion ascites bone biopsy ) may yield false negative ER and/or PR result , case pathology form early time point could use discussion study chair require . Exclusion Criteria Registration : Currently receive investigational agent systemic cancer therapy . Currently take medication herbal dietary supplement strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 inducer inhibitor . The washout period must complete prior start neratinib patient take agent . If unavoidable , patient take CYP3A4 inhibitor monitor closely . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Acute currently active/requiring antiviral therapy hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis , stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . History significant cardiac disease , cardiac risk factor , uncontrolled arrhythmia .
