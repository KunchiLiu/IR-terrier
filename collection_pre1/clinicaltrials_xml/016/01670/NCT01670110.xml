	<brief_title>Pasireotide LAR Severe Polycystic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pasireotide ( SOM230 ) novel multi-receptor-targeted analog high affinity four five SST receptor subtypes ( SSTr1 , SSTr2 , SSTr3 SSTr5 ) ; 40-fold high affinity 158-fold high functional activity SST5 receptor octreotide . Because broad receptor bind profile , pasireotide may potent Polycystic Liver Disease ( PLD ) octreotide . In randomized double blind placebo control trial investigator compare SOM230 treatment placebo 12 month patient PLD . The primary endpoint assess 12 month patient receive placebo cross SOM230 , permit participant receive SOM230 subsequent two year . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use assess liver volume - primary endpoint , assessed baseline , end year 1 3 . This study ass efficacy safety SOM230 reduce total liver volume improve quality life 12 month . ( The investigator assess efficacy 24 month . ) The therapy way effective PLD also may prove effective many patient Polycystic Kidney Disease ( PKD ) evaluate use eGFR kidney volume use MRI . The investigator plan add sub-sites location .</detailed_description>
