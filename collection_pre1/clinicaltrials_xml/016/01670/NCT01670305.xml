	<brief_summary>Residual pocket furcation defect challenge site require additional periodontal therapy . The aim study evaluate 1 ) effect single photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) monotherapy residual pocket single root teeth 2 ) effect PDT association scale root planing ( SRP ) class II furcation lesion probe pocket depth ( PPD ) &gt; 5mm bleed probing ( BoP ) . A blind randomized control clinical trial conduct subject present least three residual pocket single root teeth subject least one molar present class II furcation defect . To evaluate effect single PDT monotherapy residual pocket , select site assign receive : PDT alone , photosensitizer alone SRP alone . To evaluate effect PDT association SRP class II furcation lesion , select site assign PDT+SRP SRP alone . Clinical , microbiological immunoenzymatic analysis assess baseline , 3 6 month post-therapies .</brief_summary>
