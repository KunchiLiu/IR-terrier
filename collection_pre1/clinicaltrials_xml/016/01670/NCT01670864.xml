	<detailed_description>According report Census &amp; Statistics Department ( 2011a ) , still 659,300 daily smoker ( 11.1 % ) Hong Kong smoke kill 7,000 people per year ( Lam et al. , 2001 ) . Smoking also lead annual medical cost , long-term care productivity loss US $ 688 million 1998 ( McGhee et al. , 2006 ) , equivalent 0.6 % GDP region ( Census &amp; Statistics Department , 2011b ) . Smoking addictive , difficult motivate smoker quit without assistance . On hand , many smoker may ready quit want quit , difficult reach . The Quit Win programme provide another opportunity reach large group smoker , aim widespread quit attempt among smoker via incentive order boost number quitter ( Cahill &amp; Perera , 2011 ) . Although competition appear reach large cohort smoker , still insufficient evidence effectiveness help smoker achieve complete cessation ( Cahill &amp; Perera , 2009 ) . In 2009 , conduct 3-armed randomized control trial compare effectiveness two additional intervention 3-minute brief telephone advice ( TEL group ) 8 SMS message ( SMS group ) usual care smoke cessation self-help material ( Control group ) Quit Win Contest 2009 [ cite final report ] . More one thousand participant successfully recruit period 2 month , overall self-reported quit rate 21.6 % among contestant . However , statistical significant evidence find additional brief telephone advice SMS message increase quit rate . In 2010 , conduct another RCT Quit Win Contest 2010 compare effectiveness on-site face-to-face brief smoke cessation advice vs. self-help material ( control ) achieve quit rate change smoke behavior . Once , recruit one thousand participant period 2.5 month . A high quit rate observe intervention group ( 18.4 % ) control group ( 13.8 % ) 6-month follow-up , although marginally statistical insignificant ( p = 0.08 ) ( Wong et al. , 2012 ) . To conclude , Quit Win Contests Hong Kong successfully reach capture interest large number smoker community otherwise may even think quit smoke . On hand , additional smoking cessation intervention seem boost quit rate among smoker join Quit Win contest , dose-response relationship may appear among additional intervention . The theory The Health Action Process Approach ( HAPA ) suggest one 's intention behaviour change foster know new behaviour positive outcome oppose negative outcome accompany current behaviour ; planning ( action plan cop planning ) serve operative mediator intention behaviour ( Schwarzer , 2008 ) . Previous evidence show applicability HAPA change people 's health behaviour , e.g. , physical exercise , breast self-examination , seat belt use , dietary behaviour , dental flossing ; generalizability confirm Schwarzer ( 2008 ) . A theory-based health education card ( pocket size ) , guide HAPA , develop distributed participant reminder like 'homework assignment ' complete home , purpose enhance intention practice suggest behaviour ( quit smoking ) . Short-Message Service ( SMS ) one new method communication recent decade expand number study conduct 2000s since self-help mode , inexpensive ( term manpower ) , readily disseminate , available immediately upon request . Research evidence suggest SMS-delivered health intervention ( include smoke cessation ) positive short-term outcome ( Fjeldsoe et al. , 2009 ) . Specifically , intervention may increase intention quit ( Yu , 2010 , Ybarra , 2011 ) , use program under-utilized ( Andrews et al. , 2012 ) . In 2009 , conduct RCT test additional effect 8 SMS smoke cessation advice toward smoker participate Quit Win contest towards self-help material [ cite final report ] . Although result support additional effect SMS smoking cessation advice , may due deficient number SMS message provide . Community-Based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) partnership approach scientific research involve collaboration among community partner academic researcher throughout research process ( Israel et al. , 1998 ) . It find effective enhance community input , build community capacity , address barrier health study participant historically underrepresented research ( Andrews et al. , 2012 , Horowitz et al. , 2009 ) . Community partner capability manage great deal resource manpower , utilize network within community , beneficial scientific research involve population-based intervention . To effectively raise awareness contest recruit many participant community , work NGOs 18 Hong Kong district CBPR model may one possible way program implementation . The challenge apply CBPR model smoke cessation program equip staff NGO relate skill knowledge , maintain quality research process intervention . Therefore , train programme briefing session provide participated NGOs relevant knowledge transfer . In addition , process evaluation conduct throughout recruitment research process quality integrity effort involve NGOs monitor evaluate . Hence , propose ( 1 ) test effectiveness on-site face-to-face counsel use theory-based health education model vs. SMS message vs. self-help material assist smoker participate Quit Win Contest 2012 ; ( 2 ) use Community-Based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) model build capacity engage community partner take important public health issue sustainability community .</detailed_description>
