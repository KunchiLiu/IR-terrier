	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug , cisplatin trial , learn well work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean cisplatin still study use set research doctor try find it-in case , effective cisplatin treat breast cancer BRCA mutation carrier . It also mean FDA yet approve cisplatin type cancer . Cisplatin approve FDA treatment cancer . The purpose study evaluate cisplatin , chemotherapy drug show active treatment woman breast cancer BRCA mutation . In study , compare cisplatin standard chemotherapy , doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( `` AC '' ) might receive participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin vs. Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide BrCa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If screening test show eligible participate research study begin study treatment . You undergo research biopsy study team obtain tissue sample . This used biomarker research help doctor well understand disease , drug work body , may help identify people may benefit platinum adriamycin/cytoxan future . Because one know study option best , `` randomize '' receive either cisplatin doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( `` AC '' ) chemotherapy prior removal breast cancer . Chemotherapy administer removal cancer know neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither research doctor choose group . You equal chance place either group . If randomize receive cisplatin receive cisplatin every three week total four dos . You give cisplatin vein ( IV ) first day treatment cycle . The cisplatin infusion take 1 2 hour . Before receive cisplatin , receive fluid hydration vein , also give medicine help prevent side effect nausea . The total time infusion cisplatin additional fluid medication take 6 hour . After receive cisplatin , ask drink 12 eight ounce glass fluid per day , especially 2 3 day therapy . The study treatment stop serious side effect tumor grow despite receive cisplatin chemotherapy . If randomize `` AC '' chemotherapy receive doxorubicin cyclophosphamide every 2 3 week total four dos vein first day treatment cycle . The interval chemotherapy decide research doctor . If receive chemotherapy every two week , also receive subcutaneous injection day chemotherapy . This injection contain medicine contains growth factor boost immune system order allow body ready chemotherapy two week . The study treatment stop serious side effect tumor grow despite doxorubicin cyclophosphamide chemotherapy . At begin treatment cycle physical exam ( include weight vital sign ) ask general question health medication may take , well specific question side effect may experience receive study treatment . Prior cycle chemotherapy , standard blood test check blood count . If receive cisplatin kidney function body salt also check prior chemotherapy cycle . In addition , 7-10 day chemotherapy blood drawn look blood cell count determine risk infection ; receive cisplatin , kidney function blood electrolyte also evaluate . The blood draw perform 7-10 day chemotherapy do hospital receive chemotherapy close home . About 1 tablespoon blood drawn test . Surgery remove tumor occur within six week last dose chemotherapy . Your surgery perform surgeon , part standard care disease . Your treat physician nurse practitioner examine ass tumor time receive chemotherapy . A measurement tumor perform first day treatment cycle part physical exam . After slides initial breast cancer biopsy review hospital , slide tumor block send study pathologist Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . Likewise , chemotherapy , breast cancer remove lumpectomy mastectomy . After slide review hospital , also send tumor block study pathologist response tumor study treatment assess . After slide review , return hospital biopsy surgery perform . Decisions whether receive chemotherapy surgery treat physician . If receive chemotherapy , choice chemotherapy also doctor . Decisions post-operative chemotherapy part study .</detailed_description>
