	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Oral Paliperidone Extended-Release Oral Risperidone Immediate-Release Cognitive Function Clinically Stable Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 28-week , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , active-controlled ( patient assign either recognize effective treatment study medication ) comparative study . All patient enter run-in period receive stable therapeutic dose oral risperidone immediate-release least 4 week . After 4-week run-in period , patient randomly assign either remain oral risperidone immediate-release ( IR ) receive therapeutic dose oral paliperidone extended-release ( ER ) patient prospectively follow 24-week treatment phase . The treatment phase compose 4-week flexible dose period follow 20-week stable dose period . During 4-week flexible dose period , dose paliperidone ER risperidone IR may increase decreased patient clinically indicate ( eg , significant side effect emerge evidence lack efficacy ) . At end 4-week flexible dose period , final dose maintain 20-week fixed-dose period . Efficacy safety assess baseline ( Week 0 ) Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 .</detailed_description>
