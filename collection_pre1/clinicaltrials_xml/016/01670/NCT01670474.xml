	<brief_summary>Surface thrombogenicity standard double lumen catheter ( stDLC ) surface modify film-coated domain structure double lumen catheter ( fcDLC ) consist novel reactive polyurethane copolymer coating show vitro measure surface thrombogenicity reduce modified catheter compare standard catheter . The clinical investigation reveal number day catheter removal accord clinical requirement number treatment per catheter significantly high modify catheter compare standard catheter . Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) use primarily treat catheter thrombosis . The relatively high cost rt-PA theoretical potential cause bleeding , well morbidity mortality associate catheter malfunction infection , justify need definitive evidence efficacy rt-PA locking solution . No study aim evaluate impact rt-PA lock long-term Hemodialysis ( HD ) uncuffed catheter survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The solution instill central venous catheter lumens HD session leave catheter next session ( catheter lock solution ) use prevent thrombosis period HD session may also prevent catheter-related infection . However , evidence support use various lock solution achieve objective limit . Heparin traditional locking solution . Several small study assess whether citrate heparin equally efficacious maintain catheter patency interpretation result limited study short follow-up period include uncuffed cuffed central venous catheter . Thrombosis major cause HD catheter dysfunction , problem rectify use thrombolytic agent , invasive procedure declotting , catheter replacement . A thrombus tip catheter fibrin sheath around may resist local thrombolysis reach sufficient concentration drug . Urokinase traditionally use thrombolytic agent HD vascular access declotting , success rate declotting vary 55 % 85 % . However , successful treatment occlude central venous catheter ( non HD ) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) alteplase recently achieve 1,000 patient success ( function restore 798 patient [ 75.0 % ; 95 % CI : 72.3 77.6 % ] ) . Serious adverse event monitor within 30 day rare efficacy independent age , sex , body weight , catheter type .</detailed_description>
