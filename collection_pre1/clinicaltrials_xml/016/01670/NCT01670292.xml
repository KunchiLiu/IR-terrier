	<brief_summary>This biomechanical study Project 1 Developmental Center Clinical Translational Research Chiropractic ( DCRC I ) ( NIH/NCCAM grant 1 U19 AT004663-01 ; principal investigator Christine Goertz , DC , PhD ) . This study design monitor physiological patient self-report outcome variable . In addition , little quantitative information Spinal Manipulation Technique procedure report clinical trial , study design collect preliminary kinetic measure spinal manipulation technique delivery ( i.e . force-time profile ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants narrowly define chronic low back pain include study . Each participant treat 12 time course 6 week . The following data collect : participant characteristic may predict outcome modifier force use provider ( gender , age , height , weight , Body Mass Index ) ; spinal segment load pre-load thrusting phase ( force moment pre-load phase , peak load , load rate , thrust duration ; physiological measure ( posterior-anterior global stiffness flexion-relaxation ) ; patient-centered outcome back pain function ; concomitant medication treatment . Study participant ( n= 80 ) recruit Quad Cities metro area . A team experience chiropractic clinician work Palmer Center Chiropractic Research treat study participant . Each study participant receive 2 High Velocity Low Amplitude Spinal Manipulation treatment visit per week 6 week period . The physiological assessment perform immediately Spinal Manipulation delivery treatment visit 1 , 5 &amp; 12 ( 6 set assessment total ) . During treatment visit , also capture kinetic measure Spinal Manipulation delivery spinal segment load analysis . We collect thrust force-time profile Spinal Manipulation deliver course treatment thrust contact force analysis . Participant patient-centered outcome measure baseline 1 , treatment visit 1 , 6 , 13 .</detailed_description>
