	<brief_title>Study Simultaneous Modulated Accelerated Radiation Therapy Concurrent With Chemotherapy Treat Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one common malignant disease China , especially Chaoshan region . Concurrent chemoradiotherapy standard non-surgical treatment method disease radiation schedule 50.4~60 Gray ( Gy ) total , 1.8~2Gy per fraction generally . However , although comprehensive method , noncontrol local disease recurrence still main reason failure . Most patient esophageal cancer suffer malnutrition . A number factor include hypoxic , inflammation , radioresistance accelerate repopulation may contribute local failure disease treatment ; therefore high radiation biological equivalent dose ( BED ) improve local control probability . Although intergroup 0123 ( INT123 ) trial show simply increase total radiation dose could gain good local control overall survival rate , however , ability trial test potential benefit high radiation dose could compromized deficiency within , , observation bias , large radiate target volume usage conventional radiation technique . In word , probability increase radiation may help improve control disease deny . Modern radiation technique , intensity modulation radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , specially , able improve coverage target volume spar critical structure , increase total radiation dose . By use simultaneous modulate accelerated radiation therapy ( SMART ) technique , dose relevant normal organ per fraction could reduce significantly , dos tumor could increase high 2Gy . Thus reach double goal protection normal tissue , increase total radiation Equivalent Uniform Dose ( EUD ) . Dosimetric study proven feasibility superiority SMART-base IMRT radiation treatment esophageal cancer , compare conventional technique . Overall , SMART-base IMRT concurrent chemotherapy may improve local control overall survival rate patient esophageal cancer ; Meanwhile , acute late toxicity would tolerable slight conventional technique .</detailed_description>
