	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) common disease develop degeneration aortic wall . The natural history AAA gradual expansion leave untreated may result rupture death . The mechanism development disease unknown however appear multifactorial possibly relate degradation process within arterial wall . There grow evidence Angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBS ) may inhibitory effect remodelling process within arterial wall , thus inhibit degeneration vessel wall . Study hypothesis : ARBS associate small diameter aortas among hypertensive patient , associate low rate aortic expansion compare antihypertensive drug .</brief_summary>
