	<detailed_description>Baseline Tests : If find eligible take part study , baseline test complete screen questionnaire . The following test procedure perform : - Information collect medical record age , sex , race , disease type , well able perform normal activity daily live , drug take , possible cause shortness breath . - Your breathe rate measure . - The amount oxygen body measure use machine clip finger . - You blow device call spirometer time measure lung function . - You ask answer 4 questionnaire . The first questionnaire ask rate level symptom , pain , tiredness , sleep , appetite , depression , anxiety , drowsiness . The second questionnaire ask sensation breathing . The third questionnaire ask rate intensity shortness breath . The last questionnaire ask quality life . These questionnaire take total 40 minute complete .

You equal chance assign either group . Neither study staff know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Study Drug/Placebo Administration : After baseline test , give supply either study drug placebo bring home . Starting next morning , take 2 dexamethasone placebo capsule twice day mouth 4 day . Then , take 1 tablet twice day 3 day . After first 7 day , matter group assign , take 1 dexamethasone capsule twice day 7 day You take capsule around 8 o'clock morning 4 o'clock afternoon . You take capsule food 8 ounce water . You also receive portable spirometer test lung function . You blow machine 1 time day . Study Visits/Calls : On Days 7 14 , return clinic call phone . You bring capsule box come clinic , call study staff count number capsule . The following test procedure perform : - You ask complete 4 questionnaire complete baseline test . - You also ask side effect may think study drug help shortness breath . - You blow spirometer measure lung function . During 14 day take either study drug placebo study , call phone 1 time day ask level shortness breath remind take capsule . These call last 5 minute . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 14 day , long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction .
