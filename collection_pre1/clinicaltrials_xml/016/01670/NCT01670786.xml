	<brief_title>Safety Profile Iodopovidone Agent Pleurodesis Malignant Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chemical pleurodesis treatment choice case malignant pleural effusion . The literature mention variety chemical may use purpose , advantage disadvantage . The iodopovidone recently study due existence side effect agent . Nevertheless , still question literature regard safety possible adverse effect . Because question , propose development study ensure safety efficacy iodopovidone pleurodesis sclerosing agent . Objective : The main purpose study evaluate safety pleurodesis malignant pleural effusion use iodopovidone sclerosing agent different dos . The secondary objective determine clinical efficacy quality life patient realization propose procedure . Methods : There randomize clinical trial , cover patient diagnose malignant pleural effusion Hospital Aristides Maltez - Bahia League Against Cancer . The research revise approved Ethics Research Heart Institute , Hospital das Cl√≠nicas - FMUSP Hospital Aristides Maltez - Bahia League Against Cancer .

Main exclusion criterion iodine allergia , renal failure , thyroid disease , refusal sign inform consent patient unable respond quality life questionnaire . After inclusion , patient randomize assign two group accord iodopovidone concentration solution : 1 % 2 % . All procedure perform infusion solution chest tube previously placed.The data analysis involve clinical measure complementary exam try evaluate organ system sort possible adverse effect , classify CTCAEV . Clinical measure involve MRC dyspnea schedule , analogic visual pain schedule , visual acuity test , measurement pulse oximetry , heart rate , blood pressure temperature . Complementary exams chest x-ray , electrocardiogram laboratory test . Such measure perform preoperative , immediate postoperative , second , fourth , eleventh thirty day postoperative .
