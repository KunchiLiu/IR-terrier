	<brief_title>The Impact Fish-oil Fatty Acids Postprandial Vascular Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A loss vascular reactivity increase vascular tone increasingly recognise significant cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor highly predictive future CVD event . A previous study group show inclusion fish oil mixture administer alongside high fat meal preserve postprandial vascular function healthy men [ 1 ] . In three arm , placebo control cross study , impact individual fatty acid contain within fish-oil postprandial vascular reactivity ( measure 4 hour post test meal ) assess first time . Clinical measurement vascular function correlate CVD risk factor predictive future CVD event undertaken order ass potentially beneficial effect . In addition plasma sample take 0 4 hour determine change concentration modulators vascular tone . Accordingly , nutrient interest administer intervention arm study , present lipoprotein rich fraction . By expose cell culture EPA- DHA-enriched lipoprotein , mechanism underlie vascular response human volunteer investigate . Finally measure plasma fatty acid profile confirm circulate concentration EPA DHA increase postprandially accord intake . As recognised genetic variation , addition important determinant risk know chronic disease , play large part determine individual 's response dietary change , DNA extract whole blood take clinical screening store subsequent genotyping variant likely important regulation EPA DHA metabolism vascular tone . Although current study fully power generate definite conclusion regard genotype*diet interaction , serve generate pilot data future study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>In order recruit population relative risk develop CVD &gt; 1.5 male age 3555 year , possess one follow risk factor CVD recruit local advertisement : Total cholesterol &gt; 6mmol/L High density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDLC ) &lt; 1.0mmol/L Systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg Waist circumference &gt; 102cm Current smoker , exsmokers cease &lt; 3 month ago Subjects exist significant past medical history vascular disease medical condition likely affect study measure e.g . vascular disease , circulatory ( i.e . Reynaud 's ) , diabetes , systemic lupus erythematosus , hepatic , renal , digestive , haematological , neurological , cancer thyroidal disease . Those known allergy intervention food / commercially available supplement . Those unprepared adhere dietary restriction trial i.e . 3 day precede assessment visit ( 3 day runin period ) unwilling comply assessment per protocol . Parallel participation another research project involve concurrent dietary intervention and/or sample biological fluids/material . Having vaccination ( exclude flu vaccination ) antibiotic within 3 month start trial , vaccination schedule trial . Taking EPA DHA contain food / dietary supplement likely affect study result e.g . supplement derive marine organism equate great 1 gram EPA DHA per daily serve . Prospective participant willing cease supplementation 2 month preceding , , trial consider case case basis . Habitual consumption one portion oily fish per week ( defined 140g oil fish , include salmon , trout , mackerel , sardine , pilchard , herring , kipper , eel , whitebait , etc ) . Prescribed lipid lowering , medicine affect lipoprotein metabolism blood blotting , hypertension , vasodilator ( e.g . Viagra ) antibiotic medication . Assessed clinical screening . Unsatisfactory biochemical haematological assessment assess study clinical advisor</criteria>
