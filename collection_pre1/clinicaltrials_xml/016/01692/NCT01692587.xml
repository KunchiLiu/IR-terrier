	<brief_title>Does Protein Restriction Inhibit Prostrate Cancer Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine whether low protein diet inhibitory effect prostate cancer cell growth . The primary outcome measure relative investigator primary objective : For Group 1 expression gene proteins PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . For Group 2 PSA value obtain every three month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>group 1 1 . Patient must diagnosis prostate cancer confirm pathology . 2 . Patient must schedule undergo radical prostatectomy sooner 6 week date enrollment ( allow minimum 4 week low protein diet ) . 3 . Patient must adequate baseline protein intake ( screen 4day food record show protein &gt; 1.0 g/kg FFM ) 4 . Patient must able understand Englishlanguage instruction . 5 . Patient must able comply low protein diet ( evaluated dietitian study team member ) . 6 . Patient must able understand willing sign IRBapproved write informed consent document . 5.2.2 Inclusion Criteria Group 2 1 . Patient must diagnosis prostate cancer . 2 . Patient must previously undergo radical prostatectomy treatment prostate cancer . 3 . Patient must detectable PSA ( define PSA â‰¥ 0.1 ) least two consecutive measurement , take least one month apart , therapy PSA measurement . If patient additional therapy radical prostatectomy , must evidence rise PSA ( i.e. , two consecutive measurement least one month apart ) patient complete intervening therapy ( mean patient must fail treatment ) . 4 . Patient must adequate baseline protein intake ( screen 4day food record show protein &gt; 1.0 g/kg FFM ) . 5 . Patient must adequate baseline caloric intake ( screen 4day food record show caloric intake &gt; 1500 kcal/day ) . 6 . Patient must able understand Englishlanguage instruction . 7 . Patient must able comply low protein diet ( evaluated dietitian study team member ) . 8 . Patient must able understand willing sign IRBapproved write informed consent document . 1 . Patient must currently receive therapy prostate cancer . 2 . Patient must serious chronic illness unstable angina , uncontrolled metabolic disorder , immunologic disorder . 3 . Patient must history previous malignancy ( exception squamous basal cell carcinoma skin ) 5 year prior enrollment ( Group 1 ) 12 month prior enrollment ( Group 2 ) . 4 .
