	<brief_summary>This study evaluate feasibility endoscopic myotomy achalasia . In achalasia , loss relaxation lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) , well high baseline pressure LES . The widespread treatment disease one best long term result involve cut muscle layer low esophagus neighbour stomach without injurying underlie mucosa inner layer esophageal wall . This do surgery abdomen either big incision recently keyhole technique . This surgery various potential complication , one making hole mucosa extend cut muscle long enough obtain adequate relaxation sphincter . The per oral endoscopic myotomy ( POEM ) new intervention do also general anesthesia operating room ; however , involve skin incision procedure do fiber optic camera . It involve make cut inner layer esophagus cautery cut muscle fiber responsible blockage finally close initial opening clip . In study investigate feasibility intervention technical aspect well logistical perspective give local operating room constraint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy ( POEM ) Patients Suffering From Achalasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient routine pre-operative EGD , manometry , barium swallow , ph-metry . Equally patient undergo Eckardt 's grade system symptom severity intervention . The patient gastro-graffin swallow first day surgery . Procedure : Under general anesthesia upper endoscopy perform use standard single channel gastroscope . Submucosal injection 10 ml saline 1 % methylen blue level mid esophagus initially perform . A small longitudinal submucosal incision create use standard needle knife . For sufficient entry point well submucosal tunnel , dilate balloon insert submucosally via create incision similar technique use standard endoscopic submucosal dissection . The balloon slightly inflate allow sufficient entrance endoscope . The gastroscope advance submucosal space tunnel create via needle knife blunt dissection appropriate . The tunnel create distally stop several centimeter beyond low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) , easily identify . Using flexible scissors , triangle tip- respectively isolated tip-knife clearly visible circular muscle divide start 4 cm LES extend 2 cm beyond previously identify esophageal border . The longitudinal serosal layer leave intact . Finally mucosal entry close standard endoscopic clip . Patients receive standard postoperative care surgical myotomy , include long-term follow-up . If reason endoscopic treatment unable complete infeasible , standard laparoscopic treatment perform .</detailed_description>
