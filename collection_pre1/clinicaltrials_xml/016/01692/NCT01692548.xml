	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Intervention Development ADHD Children Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder ( ADHD ) one common mental disorder among child . It associate important burden individual , family society . ADHD chronic condition majority affect individual present symptom associate functional deficit adult life . Although pharmacological treatment easily implement short-term effective , efficacy tend decrease time long-term effect uncertain . Psychosocial treatment tend effective treatment delivery treatment effect sustain . New treatment strategy require order provide good care ADHD patient . Early intervention might avoid development disorder , limit persistency prevent associate deficit . The aim study evaluate efficacy non-pharmacological intervention child risk ADHD . This randomize controlled clinical trial aim test efficacy neurofeedback child increase risk ADHD ( subclinical ADHD symptom ) . This study multisite school base trial . Forty child 1st 4th grade subclinical ADHD symptom randomize neurofeedback wait list . Subclinical ADHD define 3-5 9 inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom accord parent clinical evaluation ( K-SADS-PL ) less 6 symptom accord teacher report ( assessed use SNAP-IV ) OR 3-5 symptom accord teacher report less 6 accord parent clinical evaluation . Exclusion criterion include IQ low 80 , severe mental disorder neurological disease . Treatment comprise 25 session NF use Slow Cortical Potential training . Children invite attend 2 session per week , session comprise 4 bloc 20 trial activation deactivation challenge . Eldith Tharaprax equipment use site . The study , include treatment session , conduct school . Two public school select host study , one SÃ£o Paulo another Porto Alegre , Brazil . Main outcome parent rating score ADHD symptom ( SWAN questionnaire ) . To avoid bias due low literacy population , parent assist staff member fill SWANs questionnaire . Second outcome include : 1 ) Performance computerized test design measure time processing , basic processing , inhibitory control executive function delay aversion 2 ) Pre- post treatment difference electrophysiological measure ( evoke relate potential two task require sustained attention , self-monitoring response attentional prime ) ; 3 ) conversion ADHD ( incident case ) . Outcomes measure assess prior treatment start , 13 session , soon 25 session , 6 month follow-up . Random regression use model subject 's response time ( baseline session 12 12th session treatment end ) . For continuous variable compare average slope regression line across two group test whether intervention superior waiting-list . Proportion new case compare across group use chi square test .</detailed_description>
