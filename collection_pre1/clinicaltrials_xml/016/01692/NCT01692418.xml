	<brief_summary>Anaemia common problem patient undergo surgery . About half patient undergoing major operation anaemia , often consequence disease require surgery . Anaemia cause patient feel tire unwell . Anaemia time surgery increase requirement blood transfusion ( 50 % anaemic compare 15 % without anaemia ) . Both anaemia blood transfusion associate increased complication surgery , delay recovery prolonged hospital stay . The investigator propose give intravenous iron operation use correct anaemia patient . Consequently patient anaemic less likely need blood transfusion . Also patient feel good health improve operation likely tolerate surgery , recover fast , less likely complication surgery return home sooner . This benefit individual patient also NHS reduce cost . Oral Iron tablet effective take 3-6 month increase blood level , tablet often tolerate cause constipation stomach pain , overall 30-50 % people continue take oral iron . A full treatment dose intravenous iron give 15 minute minimal side effect . The effect rapidly increase blood count 2-4 week . The investigator propose treatment incorporate patient preparation pathway surgery outpatient without need additional visit hospital . Small study suggest benefit iron therapy orthopaedic gynaecological surgery . This study look 500 patient undergoing major surgery 20 hospital UK . The investigator anticipate half patient treat anaemia correct operation . Patients anaemia identify part routine blood test take preoperatively invited take part study . Following informed consent , randomly allocate receive either intravenous iron placebo infusion saline . Intravenous iron dark liquid give continuously vein 15 minute . To ensure neither doctor patient know treatment give infusion prepare administer unblinded authorised person via black bag black tubing . There change patient 's normal treatment . The main aim study assess intravenous iron reduce need blood transfusion time period around operation . Further outcome measure include ; patient-reported quality life , complication , length hospital stay , cost . Outcomes assessed hospital stay patient discharge . The trial run Clinical Trials Unit considerable experience conduct large trial . The team large range experience anaemia management assessment complication , quality life cost health care . The main aim study assess intravenous iron reduce need blood transfusion time period around operation . Further outcome measure include ; patient-reported quality life , complication , length hospital stay , cost . Outcomes assessed hospital stay patient discharge .
