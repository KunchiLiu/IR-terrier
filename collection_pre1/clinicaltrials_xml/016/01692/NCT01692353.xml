	<brief_summary>This cross-sectional study primarily cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) study design ) compare select CVD biomarker data subject long-term consumer cigarette moist snuff non-consumers tobacco b ) identify principal endpoint relate CVD risk differ among three tobacco-use cohort . The following assessment provide primary study endpoint comparative analysis cohort : 1 . CVD-related physiological assessment : Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) , ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) , spirometry expire carbon monoxide ( ECO ) . 2 . CVD-related biomarker assessment blood urine ( biomarkers tobacco effect ) . 3 . Biomarkers tobacco exposure urine blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single site , observational study provide increase understanding consumption different tobacco product ( i.e. , cigarette moist snuff compare tobacco use ) affect 1 ) CVD-related physiological assessment 2 ) CVD-related biomarkers tobacco effect ( i.e. , protein , lipid , cellular component ) . A recent policy statement American Heart Association provide review analysis impact smokeless ( ST ) use cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) ( Piano et al . 2010 ) . The author acknowledge evidence consistent suggestion cardiovascular risk ST product markedly low cigarette smoking . Despite potential risk reduction transition cigarette ST consumption , study directly compare biomarkers tobacco effect ( BioEff ) among smoker , moist snuff consumer ( MSC ) non-tobacco consumer ( NTC ) . Furthermore , study measure biomarkers tobacco exposure ass ability differentiate three tobacco consumer group ( smoker , moist snuff consumer , non-tobacco consumer ) base product use . Estimating exposure combustion-related compound find tobacco smoke best accomplish use biomarkers . A key advantage human exposure biomarkers consider reliable metric level exposure consumer actually experience use tobacco product ( Hecht et al. , 2010 ) . Because combustion occur ST use , ST product lack combustion-related compound find tobacco smoke . Biomarker differences find different tobacco use group harmful potentially harmful constituent may indicate difference subsequent health risk ( Rodu Godshall , 2006 ; Hatsukami et al. , 2006 ) . Epidemiological data demonstrate health risk associate cigarette significantly great associate use non-combustible tobacco nicotine product ( Surgeon General , 2010 ) . On relative risk continuum , cigarette smoking present significantly great risk tobacco user use non-combustible smokeless product . ST product , consume orally , generate chemical associate burn tobacco , thus , present reduce toxicant profile compare smoking . To address purpose objective study , study conduct follow : - Subjects consent study prior procedure perform screen study-specific inclusion/exclusion criterion determine subject eligibility ( within 28 day study check-in ) . - Eligible subject admit clinical research unit 12:00 noon 5:00 p.m. Day 1 confine one overnight stay ( approximately 18-23 hour ) . - After study procedure complete Day 1 Day 2 , appropriate basic safety assessment make subject discharge approximately 12:00 noon Day 2 . A brief description study procedure perform list . - After check-in Day 1 , eligible subject observe 45-minute tobacco abstention period , follow use single unit usual brand ( UB ) tobacco product , refer `` Challenge . '' For smoker , `` challenge '' smoke one UB cigarette usual manner ; moist snuff consumer , 30-minute use one typical pinch UB moist snuff . - Fifteen minute end UB use , follow procedure perform sequentially : ECO ; blood sample biomarkers exposure ( serum nicotine cotinine , percent carboxyhemoglobin whole blood ) ; ABI . - At 30 minute post-UB use , FMD measure followed administration health-related questionnaire . The non-tobacco consumer product `` Challenge '' . The completion study questionnaires serve reference point collection ECO , ABI FMD . - Blood biomarkers tobacco exposure collect Day 1 follow product `` Challenge '' Day 2 follow overnight tobacco abstention fast . - Urine biomarkers tobacco exposure effect collect Day 1 post- '' Challenge '' Day 2 fasting . - Blood biomarkers tobacco effect collect Day 2 fasting , follow re-assessment physiological measure ( ECO , ABI , FMD ) assessment CIMT .</detailed_description>
