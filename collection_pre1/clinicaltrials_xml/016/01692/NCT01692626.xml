	<detailed_description>Adult patient treat cetuximab malignancy offer chance take part study . Patients must provide write informed consent order participate study ( include consent clinical photograph ) . The area skin treat investigational cream face . Baseline photograph take select area bilateral face . Patients request apply thin layer investigational cream twice daily one half face time start cetuximab . Patients provide placebo cream apply side face . Patients provide sufficient investigational cream free charge duration study . The study coordinator instruct patient regard side face apply investigational cream . This randomly assign study coordinator base randomization list generate biostatistics core know study coordinator . The dermatologist study investigator remain blinded side investigational cream apply . In manner , patient serve control . Patients free use oral tetracycline recommend primary oncologist . Patients trial , however , use another rash treatment exception moisturize agent . Patients participate study instruct apply moisturize cream , lotion , ointment choice face three time day . Moisturizers apply skin , , investigational cream application . Patients wet treated area skin one hour apply investigational cream , otherwise could wash . The investigational cream apply near eye . Patients study instructed minimize sun exposure avoid exposure artificial sunlight . Patients apply sunscreen expose sunlight , investigational cream completely absorbed skin . Patients give copy Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) questionnaire ask complete study visit . Patients give help complete questionnaire need . The questionnaire interpretation list appendix . Patients assess least every two week person . These visit may coincide appointment primary oncologist treatment cancer . Patients able contact study coordinator duration study . Patients also request contact study coordinator investigator rash appear worsen . The rash assess treat oncologist study visit . Their treating oncologist remain blind side pimecrolimus cream apply . Clinical photograph rash take . When rash appear predominantly side pimecrolimus apply rash appear worsen first 24 hrs application pimecrolimus patient consider allergic pimecrolimus , treatment stop . The rash compare side face document use National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria ( NCI CTC ) acneiform rash . A papule pustule count also determine study dermatologist document clinical photograph . Toxicity topical pimecrolimus therapy also assess described appendix . Toxicity assessment describe use NCI CTC Version 4 . Toxicities observe define related ( definitely , probably , possibly ) unrelated topical pimecrolimus treatment . The total duration study four week . After two week topical pimecrolimus patient request come study visit . This coordinate usual oncologist visit possible . After rash assessment visit , treat oncologist patient unblinded . If intensity rash treat area worse correspond untreated area opposite side use NCI CTC version 4 scale acneiform rash , severe toxicity occur patient , patient find pimecrolimus therapy tolerable , patient continue study . At study visit , patient also give copy DLQI ask complete . Patients give help complete questionnaire study coordinator need . The questionnaire interpretation list appendix . Clinical photograph take . Patients experience worsen rash intensity NCI CTC Version 4.0 treat area , suffer severe toxicity ( grade 3 4 ) relate topical pimecrolimus , find topical pimecrolimus intolerable discontinue use pimecrolimus area immediately come study . Patients continue study two week visit may apply thin layer 1 % topical pimecrolimus twice daily side face . Patients continue pimecrolimus therapy , beyond initial rash assessment , re-assessed two week manner initial rash assessment . Patients remain study maximum 4 week since start pimecrolimus therapy . At 4 week study visit , patient also give copy DLQI ask complete . Patients give help complete questionnaire study coordinator need . The questionnaire interpretation list appendix Patients consider benefited pimecrolimus therapy 4 week visit may choose use commercially available pimecrolimus protocol advise safety topical pimecrolimus establish beyond one year use , insurance might cover treatment . RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN There highly-effective treatment epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -inhibitor induced rash . In study patient offer 1 % pimecrolimus cream , addition standard non-topical therapy oral tetracycline antibiotic moisturize agent . Patients apply 1 % pimecrolimus cream one side face time start cetuximab . The opposite untreated side serve control side . In controlled manner , decrease papule pustule count and/or rash severity per NCI CTC version 4.0 use topical pimecrolimus , without severe intolerable toxicity demonstrate pilot study , large scale study therapy may warrant .</detailed_description>
