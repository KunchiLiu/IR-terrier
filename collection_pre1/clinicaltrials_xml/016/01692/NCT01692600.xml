	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy head neck cancer patient cause late oral radiation complication xerostomia ( dry mouth ) mucosal atrophy . Currently , method hyperbaric oxygen use treat complication ; however , quantifiable mean assess outcome method . At present , subjective method superficial examination oral cavity use , yet complication know mostly start subsurface layer . In feasibility study , apply image technique call optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) mean provide objective quantifiable image subsurface micro-structural micro-vascular change oral tissue . Depth-resolved , micrometer-resolution OCT image provide information change associate late radiation complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient imaging At image session , patient ask sit chair put her/his chin chin-rest height chair adjust accordingly . Before turn light source , patient ask wear safety goggles open her/his mouth probe slowly move inside oral cavity . At point , look superficial oral tissue , find region oral cavity superficial change . When region find , OCT image region take . Imaging location expect take 3 4 minute ( include time require find region interest , acquisition structural , Doppler speckle variance image , time process ) . After , patient close her/his mouth rest couple minute . The procedure perform another site complication . The 3-4 minute image procedure repeat 3 5 time ( depend patient ' ability keep mouth open ) , patient dismiss sterile probe cover dispose . All acquire data store computer keep locked office . The data process within week image session structural , Doppler speckle variance image image site complication compare . During imaging , structural OCT real-time image show monitor facilitate task find region interest keep track patient 's movement move probe accordingly . During Doppler speckle variance imaging ( approximately 7 second within 3-4 minute interval mention ) , patient ask keep still possible , order avoid motion artifact OCT image . Note time frame study 1 day , since subject image follow-up assessment . Imaging healthy volunteer The imaging session volunteer take 30 60 minute . The imaging procedure healthy volunteer similar explain patient ; however , acquire OCT image group would healthy oral tissue . Note time frame study 1 day , since volunteer image follow-up assessment . **Important note : The aim study compare image patient healthy volunteer show specific change structural vascular feature patient ( due radiation toxicity ) compare volunteer . So , comparison do two cohort study . Data analysis For healthy volunteer , gather OCT data process form structural , Doppler speckle variance image healthy oral tissue serve reference . The procedure perform late oral radiation toxicity patient reconstruct structural , Doppler speckle variance image site oral complication . Then , image healthy volunteer patient compare term layer thickness , back-reflection property layer , size profile blood flow microvasculature . In order compare two set image quantitatively , certain metric define base image healthy volunteer . All quantitative comparison healthy oral tissue tissue radiation complication use form OCT atlas oral radiation toxicity . Moreover , white-light image region OCT study take order serve reference superficial complication cause radiation .</detailed_description>
