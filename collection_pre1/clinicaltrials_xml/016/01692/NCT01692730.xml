	<detailed_description>Purpose study . This group randomize control trial test effectiveness enhance web-based cessation intervention student smoker 2-year Community Colleges ( CC ) . Compared smoking rate general population ( 18 % ) , smoke rate among CC student varies remain substantially high ( 28-30 % ) . Evaluations Web-Assisted Tobacco Interventions ( WATI ) smoke cessation treatment young adult traditional 4-year college setting yield encouraging preliminary data regard intervention effectiveness . Young adult continue understudied , additional randomized design study cessation intervention need generate acceptable level strength evidence regard quit rate , particularly CC student little data cessation available . This critical population likely increase several reason , include President Obama 's American Graduation Initiative , provide resource increase Community College enrollment 5 million additional graduate 2020 . In proposed trial , subject campus randomize basic intervention arm direct minimally interactive website standardize comply 2008 DHHS Clinical Practice Guidelines adult smoker . Those campus enhance intervention arm direct enhanced site add novel interactive social network feature , include variety better-practice feature recommend WATI workshop , recent literature , technologically advanced proactive feature ( e-mail , SMS texting , social networking ) . Our study follow Specific Aims : Primary Aims Aim 1 : To test effectiveness Enhanced interactive WATI ( E-WATI ) vs. Basic WATI ( B-WATI ) among Community College student ( primarily young adult ) . The online methodology maximize population access , effective , recommend feasible cessation option . Aim 2 : To evaluate WATI option overall usability , well usability perceive helpfulness key feature ( i.e. , basic , novel , high-tech , proactive interactive component ) , relationship cessation . Secondary Aim Aim 3 : To develop evaluate strategy recruit retain understudied population Community College smoker use WATI intervention . Evaluation recruitment strategy useful current trial , well well future trial population . This study conduct three phase , use mixed method approach . Phase 1 qualitative research Year 01 help guide refine recruitment retention delivery strategy . In Phase 2 , group randomize trial Years 02-04 randomize 16 Community Colleges ( 8 match pair ; 1,440 smoker ) one two intervention : 1 ) B-WATI - basic website cessation comparable general adult population , include establish evidence-based cessation information feature ; 2 ) E-WATI - enhance highly interactive website cessation . Phase 3 dissemination Year 05 involve interpretation study result , guidance research , dissemination study finding , include recommendation include WATI cessation campus-based referral strategy . To address Specific Aims , study Primary Hypotheses : H1.0 : Smokers E-WATI high biochemically verify point-prevalence abstinence 6-months compare B-WATI group . Secondary hypothesis smoking-related outcome explore : ( H1.1 ) high rate self-reported intention quit ; ( H1.2 ) , high number quit attempt 6-months E-WATI group compare B-WATI high quit rate 12 month subsample available follow-up ; ( H1.3 ) high number prolong abstinence participant 6-months , ( H1.4 ) , great movement Stages Change . H2.0 : Smokers E-WATI group , compare B-WATI , demonstrate interactivity engagement web-based feature intervention measure website usability analysis high self-report number type select online strategy 6-month follow-up . H3.0 : Web-based feature perceive helpful smoke cessation E-WATI compare B-WATI measure 6-month follow-up questionnaire . Overall , study evaluate evidence novel enhance cessation intervention model add understand successful intervention understudied population primarily young adult Community College smoker . The intervention component replicable , effective , WATI methodology applicable across heterogeneous population geographic area , potential broad public health impact improve delivery effective cessation intervention via internet .</detailed_description>
