	<brief_summary>Background : Trauma major cause death child teenager . When young patient suffer major traumatic injury , require intravenous ( iv ) fluid keep blood vessel full ensure blood flow vital organ . Current fluid guideline International Trauma Committees recommend either Normal Saline ( NS ) Ringer 's Lactate ( RL ) fluid choice patient . Although solution share similarities composition , also significant difference sodium , chloride lactate concentration . Despite difference fluid composition , never study compare two fluid paediatric trauma patient determine optimal . In study , investigator aim determine optimal fluid choice trauma resuscitation young patient . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize severely injured paediatric trauma patient resuscitate NS optimal blood sodium level compare patient resuscitate RL . Methods : The investigator study 50 paediatric trauma patient randomize half randomly receive NS half receive RL iv fluid 24 hour . After 24 hour , investigator compare blood sodium level , amount acid , concentration inflammation molecule relation receive NS versus RL . Expected Results Significance : Maintaining optimal level biochemical marker imperative reduce morbidity mortality severely injured paediatric patient . If significant difference present , investigator able determine fluid prefer expect data complement current trauma resuscitation guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Of Normal Saline Versus Ringer 's Lactate In Paediatric Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Trauma major killer child adolescent . The care paediatric trauma patient guide Advanced Trauma Life Support ( ATLS ) guideline . Fluid resuscitation critical aspect trauma resuscitation avoid hypoperfusion metabolic acidosis , maintain adequate oxygen delivery tissue . ATLS recommend use either intravenous Normal Saline ( NS ) Ringer 's Lactate ( RL ) trauma fluid resuscitation . There currently recommendation study suggest two fluid appropriate pediatric trauma patient ionic composition differ . As , solution potential benefit potential complication . There three primary issue relate choice solution . 1 . Sodium concentration risk iatrogenic hyponatremia : NS high sodium content relative RL ( 154 vs. 130 mmol/L , respectively ; normal blood level 135-145 mmol/L ) . Maintenance normal slightly elevated sodium level paediatric trauma patient often imperative , give vast majority patient significant traumatic brain injury . Hyponatremia worsen cerebral edema increase intracranial pressure . In previous study conduct u Children 's Hospital , LHSC report paediatric trauma patient centre receive NS . Despite NS use resuscitation fluid , pediatric trauma patient show trend towards low-normal level sodium blood . Given low content sodium RL , question whether NS superior maintenance blood sodium . 2 . Chloride concentration risk iatrogenic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis : NS contain significantly chloride RL maintain electro-neutrality ( 154 vs. 109 mmol , respectively ; normal blood level 98-108 mmol/L ) . In contrast , RL solution replace 28 mmol/L chloride equimolar lactate . As elevated chloride content NS postulate instigate undesired consequence drive blood bicarbonate lower produce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis,6 , 7 question whether NS inferior RL maintenance blood pH . 3 . Exacerbation trauma-induced inflammation : Trauma result systemic inflammatory response ( Fraser Lab , unpublished result ) . Exacerbation inflammatory state non-optimal resuscitation practice might worsen overall outcome . Published data non-trauma patient suggest NS administration pro-inflammatory relative RL,9 possibility study paediatric patient , trauma patient . The inflammatory cascade assess blood measuring level global inflammatory marker [ erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ] specific pro-inflammatory mediator elevate multisystem trauma [ interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) ] . Given high inflammatory potential associate NS , question whether NS inferior RL minimize inflammatory cascade . Hypothesis : We hypothesize severely injured paediatric trauma patient resuscitate NS optimal blood sodium level compare patient resuscitate RL , expense hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis exaggerate inflammation . Methodology : This study prospective , single-blinded , RCT severely injure paediatric trauma patient admit Children 's Hospital , London Health Sciences Centre . While clinical staff treat patient aware treatment group , patient , well laboratory technician determine serum change blind fluid administer . Randomization : Patients immediately randomize either receive NS RL resuscitation maintenance fluid first 24 hour . Randomization , via selection seal envelope base computer-generated list , do trauma resuscitation room intravenous access nurse without delay arrival . Intravenous access solution administration occur priority within minute arrival trauma room . Clinical Data Blood Analyses : All patient include study enter LHSC Trauma Database , comprise 400 data element , single , trained Trauma Data Analyst . The database regularly undergoes quality monitoring ensure data complete high quality . Descriptive analysis epidemiologic profile demographic , clinical injury data undertaken , publish previously . A baseline trauma blood panel drawn upon presentation resuscitation room ( Time `` 0 '' ) , repeat 24 hour . Blood measurement analyse include serum sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , base excess , osmolality , blood gas , ESR CRP . An extra blood vial take stored batch analyse pro-inflammatory cytokine multiplex assay ( IL- 6 , IL-8 , G-CSF MCP-1 ) . Other intervention carry per standard care discretion Trauma responsible physician . Any medication additional fluid patient receive record . The total amount intravenous fluid receive first 24 hour measure patient . Data Analysis : Descriptive analysis epidemiologic profile demographic , clinical injury data undertaken , publish previously . Treatment group compare use Mann Whitney U test outcome measure 24 hour , continuous . This include primary outcome variable ( serum sodium ) secondary outcome variable ( serum chloride , bicarbonate , pH inflammatory marker : ESR , C-RP , IL-6 , Il-8 , G-CSF , MCP-1 ) .</detailed_description>
