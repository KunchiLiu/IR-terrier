	<brief_title>Telemedicine Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( TELE-IBD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic condition result debilitate symptom . Although effective treatment exist , inadequate monitoring symptom side effect , nonadherence , poor patient knowledge barrier success . Telemedicine use chronic disease improve outcomes ; pilot test telemedicine demonstrate feasible accepted IBD . Our preliminary result randomize trial participant ulcerative colitis show significant improvement quality life baseline one year telemanagement group . Study Design : Telemedicine Patients Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( Tele-IBD ) 12-month , multicenter , randomize , control trial ass impact Tele-IBD compare standard care participant IBD . The aim study : ( 1 ) ass disease activity participant IBD use Tele-IBD compare participant use standard care , ( 2 ) ass quality life participant IBD use Tele-IBD compare participant use standard care , ( 3 ) estimate difference person-level rate utilization health care resource participant IBD use Tele-IBD compare participant use standard care . Methods : Tele-IBD consist web-portal weight scale . Participants answer question IBD symptom , side effect adherence use home PC laptop wireless Internet access provide study . A series educational topic administer via video message every 2-3 week . Tele-IBD participant complete self-testing weekly every week ; result immediately available web-portal review . Based response , alert action plan create participant . A nurse care coordinator consult participant 's medical provider management change necessary . IBD patient evaluate University Maryland , Baltimore , University Pittsburgh , Vanderbilt University invite participate . Interested patient randomize 1:1:1 fashion receive Tele-IBD weekly , Tele-IBD every week , standard care . Disease activity , quality life , medical adherence , utilization health care resource assess every 6 month one year . In addition , provider interaction patient three arm monitor record . Expected Findings : Tele-IBD decrease disease activity improve quality life improve adherence monitoring symptom , earlier effective implementation therapy , frequent patient-provider interaction , improve patient self-management . Better control IBD result decrease utilization health care resource . Significance : If Tele-IBD improve outcome , likely use improve IBD care , contain health care cost , increase access care , improve adherence physician performance measure .</detailed_description>
