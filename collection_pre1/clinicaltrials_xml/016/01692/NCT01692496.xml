	<brief_summary>Soft tissue bone sarcoma rare malignant tumor , encompass large family 50 histologically distinct tumor subtypes , share putative mesenchymal origin . In case soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) surgical excision mainstay treatment , despite curative surgery , around half patient develop distant metastasis die disease . Few therapeutic approach currently available patient unresectable , locally advanced , metastatic STS anthracyclines , ifosfamide trabectedin show activity , response rate 20-40 % previously untreated patient . Recent ongoing trial investigate variety combination chemotherapeutic regimen ( variously employ ifosfamide , doxorubicin , gemcitabine , temozolomide , vincristine , cisplatin , dacarbazine , among others ) well targeted therapy , case yield improvement response rate little impact survival . No medical option currently available , median survival patient soft-tissue sarcoma non-resectable metastasis around 12-15 month , approximately 8 month second line chemotherapy . Liposarcomas STS account least 20 % STS adult . They classify 3 histologically biologically different subtypes : well-differentiated liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma ( ALT-WD ) , myxoid round cell liposarcoma pleomorphic liposarcoma . ALT-WD liposarcoma locally aggressive rarely metastasize tumor characterize ring giant marker chromosome cytogenetic analysis amplification 12q13-21 region FISH ( MDM2 , CDK4 HMGIC ) . They account 40 % iv liposarcoma 5 year OS around 80 % . In series WD/DD treat several regimen response rate 12.5 % OS 15 month median PFS 3.6 month ( 95 CI : 3.3-5.9 ) Mixoid /round cell liposarcoma account 45-50 % liposarcoma . They tend metastasize unusual soft tissue bone location . High histologic grade 5 % round cell component associate 5-year OS 50 % approximately . They characterize ( 23 ; 16 ) ( q13-14 ; p11 ) lead fusion CHOP TLS gene Pleomorphic liposarcoma account approximately 5-10 % liposarcoma , characterize high grade feature frequent early lung metastasis cytogenetically high chromosome count complex structural rearrangement . VEGF express many STS increase expression associate high grade bad prognosis . Pazopanib oral angiogenesis inhibitor target mainly VEGFR , PDGFR c-kit . Recently result phase II trial pazopanib STS publish . It four-cohort 2-stages study . The liposarcoma stratum close first stage PFS 12 week 17 % ( 3 17 patient progress 12 week ) . After central pathologic review , 2 patient initially classified STS find liposarcoma stable disease 12 week ( 5/19 : 26 % PFS12w ) , thus fulfil criterion cohort expansion . Phase II study complete phase III study patient liposarcomas exclude therefore data liposarcoma cohort inconclusive . Furthermore positive result phase III study PALETTE recently communicate , encourage treatment sarcoma : progression-free survival ( PFS ) per independent review significantly prolong pazopanib ( median : 4.6 v 1.5 month ; HR=0.31 , 95 % CI 0.24-0.40 ; P &lt; 0.0001 ) . The interim analysis overall survival show statistically non-significant improvement pazopanib v placebo ( median : 11.9 v 10.4 month , HR=0.83 , 95 % CI 0.62-1.09 ) . Soluble factor associate efficacy toxicity pazopanib patient also report . Decreases VEGFR2 increase PlGF associate toxicity ( HTA TSH elevation ) poor prognosis .</brief_summary>
