	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine lung ultrasound ( LUS ) replace chest x-ray ( CXR ) evaluate patient possible pneumonia . Specifically , look overall reduction CXR LUS use first . Our null hypothesis LUS replace CXR diagnose pneumonia . Our alternate hypothesis LUS replace CXR diagnose pneumonia . Our secondary objective include : ( 1 ) comparison unscheduled healthcare visit index Emergency Department ( ED ) visit subject undergo CXR first undergo LUS first , ( 2 ) evaluation rate antibiotic use two group , ( 3 ) comparison admission rate , ( 4 ) comparison length stay Emergency Department two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Lung Ultrasound Compared Chest X-ray Diagnosing Pneumonia Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Ultrasound widely accept diagnostic tool use emergency department , support American College Emergency Physicians position statement 2001 ( revised 2008 ) . Evidence-based guideline point-of-care lung ultrasound recently publish ( Volpicelli et al 2012 ) . Lichtenstein et al ( 2004 ) perform bedside LUS 117 critically ill patient evaluate alveolar consolidation compare finding CT , gold standard . Sensitivity ultrasound 90 % specificity 98 % , indicate US feasible image modality lung . Copetti et al ( 2008 ) compare diagnostic accuracy LUS CXR child suspect pneumonia . 79 child underwent LUS CXR . Lung ultrasound positive diagnosis pneumonia 60 patient , whereas CXR positive 53 . Copetti conclude LUS reliable CXR diagnose pneumonia plus added benefit radiation exposure patient . Shah et al ( 2009 ) find LUS superior CXR detect pneumonia . 200 patient suspect pneumonia enrol underwent LUS CXR . LUS detect 49 pneumonia whereas CXR detect 36 . The 13 case radiographically occult pneumonia identify LUS le 1 centimeter diameter , suggest LUS superior identify early and/or small pulmonary consolidation . This particular study find LUS able detect pneumonia Sensitivity 86 % Specificity 97 % . Additionally , Tsung et ( 2009 ) find feasible use ultrasound distinguish viral bacterial pneumonia , thus indicate another striking advantage LUS . From study , clear lung ultrasound play role diagnosis pulmonary pathology moreover possible LUS may replace CXR image modality choice . This study design comparative effectiveness randomize control trial ultrasound chest x-ray diagnosing pneumonia . The study cite perform Shah et al 2009 forms basis pilot data plan randomize controlled trial . In Dr. Shah 's study , miss pneumonias treatment pneumonia pneumonia diagnose lung ultrasound . Study Design - Currently CXR standard care detection pneumonia , however , publish evidence demonstrate LUS reliable CXR even surpass CXR detect small and/or early pneumonias well differentiate viral bacterial process cite ( Lichtenstein et al 2004 ; Copetti et al 2008 ; Shah et al 2009 ; Tsung et al 2012 ) . The motivation conduct study possibly identify image modality well current standard care . It primary aim compare two image modality clinical outcome see subject investigational arm well outcome control arm receive standard care . The attend physician fellow care patient determine patient eligible . If ED provider clearly identifies pneumonia ultrasound patient diagnose treat pneumonia without subject unnecessary radiation CXR . However , provider clearly identify pneumonia ultrasound LUS fail detect pneumonia clinical suspicion remain high , provider option proceed CXR assist diagnosis pneumonia . Alternatively , subject randomize control arm CXR first follow LUS , LUS often provide additional information CXR note ( e.g . ability differentiate viral pneumonia infection ) .</detailed_description>
