	<brief_summary>The investigator thus propose use innovative randomize effectiveness trial design test theory early automatic identification ¡ Low Systolic Blood Pressure¡± clinical condition decision-support alert prompt earlier hemodynamic support consequently reduce duration condition . Specifically , investigator test hypothesis provide DSS alert regard hypotension reduce duration hypotensive episode . The core investigator study exist electronic anesthesia record smart-alarm decision-support system . All patient undergo surgery Hillcrest randomly assign routine care DSS support . In patient assigned DSS support , systolic blood pressure le 80 mmHg generate warning within three minute detection . Clinicians free act alert , ignore alert , consider provide information without act . The randomization , complete anesthesia record , detailed record hypotensive event , alert provide , clinician response , SAP response , capture investigator electronic record-keeping system . The investigator primary outcome duration time patient systolic blood pressure le 80 mmHg . Secondary outcome duration hospitalization . The investigator assess effect alert primary outcome time SBP return 80 mmHg use survival analysis , time event censor ( consider non-event ) either end surgery end monitoring patient return 80 mmHg .</brief_summary>
