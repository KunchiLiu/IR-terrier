Subject must possess educational level degree understand English enables communicate suitably PI study coordinator . Female subject pregnant lactating . Current physical finding nasal polyp , septal perforation , nasal ulceration . ( Subjects show significant progression nasal pathology screen randomization would exclude discretion investigator . ] Planned insertion nasal septal jewelry study period . Surgery ( include biopsy ) atrophic rhinitis rhinitis medicamentosa permit within last 30 day prior Screening visit . Participation investigational drug trial within 30 day precede Screening visit plan participation another investigational drug trial time trial . A known hypersensitivity corticosteroid excipients formulation ciclesonide . History respiratory infection disorder [ include , limited bronchitis , pneumonia , influenza , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ] within 14 day precede Screening visit . History alcohol drug abuse within 2 year precede Screening visit . History positive test HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C. Active asthma require treatment inhale systemic corticosteroid . Use chronic treatment agent know promote development cataract ( potassiumsparing diuretic allopurinol ) . Non vaccinate exposure active infection , chickenpox measles within 21 day precede Screening Visit . Initiation pimecrolimus cream 1 % great tacrolimus ointment 0.03 % great study period plan dose escalation study period . However , initiation creams/ointments 30 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose study period may consider inclusion . Use nasal corticosteroid within 14 day , ocular , oral parenteral within 6 month prior randomization . Have follow condition judge investigator clinically significant and/or affect subject 's ability participate clinical trial : 1. impaired hepatic function include alcohol relate liver disease cirrhosis 2. diabetes mellitus 3. malignancy ( exclude basal cell carcinoma ) Any condition , judgment investigator , would preclude subject complete protocol capture assessment write Ocular Exclusion Criteria History bacterial viral infection eye within 14 day Screening visit current history ocular herpes simplex . Any use within 6 month prior randomization plan use trial topical ocular corticosteroid , intraocular periocular injection corticosteroid .
