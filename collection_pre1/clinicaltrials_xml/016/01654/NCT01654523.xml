	<brief_title>Awareness Enhancement Monitoring Device Treatment Trichotillomania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESCRIPTION ( provide applicant ) : The goal propose research refine evaluate inconspicuous , awareness- enhancement monitoring device ( AEMD ) assist treatment trichotillomania ( TTM ) . TTM associate significant impairment social function often profound negative impact self- esteem well . Conservative estimate suggest 0.6 % percent US population , 1.8 million people , meet full diagnostic criterion TTM approximately 7.5 million US resident significant hair pull problem . Of treated , 60 % 70 % wholly partially refractory standard behavioral pharmacological treatment could therefore potentially benefit device . Best practice treatment TTM involve form behavioral therapy know habit reversal therapy ( HRT ) . HRT require person TTM aware hair pull behavior , yet majority person TTM pull hair outside awareness . HRT also require TTM sufferer record frequency duration hair pull behavior yet impossible person monitor behavior unaware . Our Phase I effort produce prototype device ( AEMD ) solve two problem . The prototype AEMD signal TTM sufferer hand approach hair , thereby bring pulling-related behavior awareness . The prototype AEMD also log time , date , duration , user classification hair pull related event . Our publish pilot study subsequent investigation establish prototype AEMD successfully alert TTM sufferer pulling-related behavior monitor TTM-related behavior laboratory set . With respect technological innovation , project potential develop first available miniaturize , wearable , patient interactive , real-time data collect proximity-sensing device alert sufferer presence mental illness symptom occur keep track frequency intensity problem . The patented technology develop AEMD potential great value range health/mental health condition industrial application . Our overall Phase II aim refine AEMD evaluate acceptance utility use open trial course professionally-led habit reversal therapy . It hypothesize AEMD enthusiastically accept TTM sufferer clinician perform design clinical trial . The Phase II AEMD include bracelet ( ) /watch worn wrist , another element place rear base neck , pager-like alert device wear belt-line pocket . The AEMD , find useful effective , potential significantly reduce symptom TTM associate functional impairment . The AEMD also great potential improve assessment monitoring TTM behavior could invaluable clinician plan treatment researcher evaluate efficacy various treatment strategy . We discover electronic monitoring capability AEMD function properly . Therefore report time spend pull use electronic device . We rely self-report instrument assess impact psychotherapy combine device severity trichotillomania .</detailed_description>
