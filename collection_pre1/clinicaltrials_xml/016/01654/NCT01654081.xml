	<brief_summary>The goal trial demonstrate potential clinical benefit irinotecan chemotherapy patient specific NSCLC phenotype , ISG15-positive . The use irinotecan subject ISG15-positive NSCLC associate improved rate clinical benefit ( objective response , disease stability , time progression ) compare historical control previously select ISG-15 expression .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must 18 year age great histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer advance treat adequately radiotherapy surgery ; metastatic recurrent disease least one prior chemotherapy regimen Prior invasive malignancy allow , provide least five year elapse since completion therapy enrollment protocol . All participant must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic NSCLC ; prior adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy NSCLC also allow , NOT count toward number regimen metastatic disease unless patient develop evidence metastatic disease within six month initiation adjuvant chemotherapy , indicate resistance platinumbased therapy . There limit number prior regimen allow , provide patient meet eligibility criterion . Patients may best benefit application specific target therapy ( i.e. , erlotinib EGFR exon 19 21 activating mutation , crizotinib EML4ALK translocation ) eligible protocol document progression target therapy AND platinumbased doublet regimen All participant must appropriate phenotype pretreatment screen tumor tissue sputum , consist ISG15positive cell immunohistochemistry ( stain score 412 , define section 4.2 ) , perform UK Department Pathology , must agree tissue evaluate ISG15 expression ( separate inform consent request ) . Potential participant available tissue assessment offer sputum assessment tissue biopsy perform safely , potential disease sit safely approach , opinion attend physician participation protocol represent best treatment option time . Subjects assessable material require undergo separate biopsy solely participation protocol . Subjects must follow baseline laboratory value ( bone marrow , renal , hepatic ) : Adequate bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/μL Platelet count &gt; 100'000/μL Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x normal Serum calcium &lt; 12 mg/dl Signed Informed Consent ECOG Performance Status &lt; 2 Life expectancy &gt; 16 week Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Patients childbearing potential must use effective mean contraception . The effect Irinotecan develop human fetus unknown . For reason camptothecins know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion irinotecan administration . Prior therapy irinotecan , topotecan , camptothecin analog Patients whose tumor harbor EGFR exon 19 21 mutation yet receive prior therapy EGFRspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib gefitinib Patients whose tumor harbor EML4/ALK translocation yet receive crizotinib Pregnant lactating female Myocardial infarction ischemia , active cerebrovascular disease , within 6 month Cycle 1 ' Day 1 Uncontrolled clinically significant dysrhythmia Prior radiotherapy indicator lesion unless objective evidence tumor growth lesion Uncontrolled metastatic disease central nervous system ( previously treat , stable disease allowable protocol ) Radiotherapy within 2 week registration Surgery within 2 week registration Any co morbid condition ' view attend physician ' render patient high risk treatment complication Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Pregnant woman exclude study Irinotecan camptothecin potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Irinotecan , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Irinotecan . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Irinotecan . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
