	<brief_title>Oral Versus Intravenous Hydration Prevent Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Iodinated contrast medium regularly use diagnostic interventional procedure . The intravascular use contrast medium cause acute kidney injury ( Contrast Induced Nephropathy ) . Contrast Induced Nephropathy associate increased morbidity mortality . There treatment option , therefore preventive measure take . Volume expansion reduces risk Contrast Induced Nephropathy . Current guideline prevention Contrast-Induced Nephropathy advise high risk patient admit hydration intravenous normal saline period 8-24 hour . This proposal evaluate alternative method hydration ; home hydration salt tablet . Objective : To investigate home-hydration non inferior alternative in-hospital hydration prevention Contrast Induced Nephropathy high risk patient . Study design : multi-centre randomized control trial . Study population : Adult patient &gt; 18 year undergoing elective procedure involve intravascular administration iodinate contrast medium high risk development Contrast Induced Nephropathy ( define guideline criterion ) . Intervention : Arm A : sodium chloride 1g/10kg body weight/day per os day -2 -1 contrast exposure . With maximum dose 10 gram sodium chloride day . Arm B : Nacl 0.9 % total 1000ml 4 hr ( case heart failure severe renal failure ) 12 hr 4 12 hr contrast administration . Main study parameters/endpoints : The incidence Contrast Induced Nephropathy , effect need hospitalisation , patient satisfaction . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients randomize home hydration receive salt tablet start 48 hrs procedure . The risk take salt tablet low , report nausea . Because investigator exclude patient decompensated heart failure use amount salt consider safe investigator expect sign overhydration . The investigator monitor telephone consult , 24 hour intake first tablet . Body weight intake tablet monitor . Before contrast administration blood urine sample take . Patients randomize intravenous hydration admit receive standard treatment high risk patient addition one blood urine sample take contrast administration . In patient 48-72 hour contrast administration blood sample take check development CIN , standard treatment accord guideline . The investigator ask patient fill questionnaire patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
