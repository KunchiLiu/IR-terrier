	<brief_title>Tivantinib Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) intravenous ( IV ) topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) . II . To describe toxicity ARQ 197 IV topotecan dose study . III . To characterize pharmacokinetic behavior ARQ 197 give concurrent use IV topotecan . IV . To document clinical response ARQ 197 IV topotecan . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study tivantinib topotecan hydrochloride . Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-5 , pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 6 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
