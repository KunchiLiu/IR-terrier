	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) , include common cold influenza , lead cause morbidity mortality , major economic impact . Both mental physical health link ARI burden . For example , people report negative emotion high stress likely get ARI . Exercise affect immune system , improve physical mental health , may protect ARI illness . Mindfulness meditation reduces perceive stress , influence immune system , may protect ARI . The investigator ' recent NCCAM-funded trial randomize 154 people 3 group : 1 ) meditation , 2 ) moderate intensity exercise , 3 ) wait-list control . For 149 people follow study completion , 40 ARI episode 453 day illness control group , 27 episode 257 day ARI illness meditation group , 26 episode 241 day ARI illness exercise group . Corresponding reduction ARI-related work day lose ARI illness observe . The propose research build upon finding refine methodology large sample : A ) determine whether finding replicable , B ) investigate potential explanatory pathway . This research use state-of-the-art randomized control trial ( RCT ) methodology assess potential effect meditation exercise ARI outcomes . This 5-year project , 4 yearly cohort n=99 per cohort randomize 3 group n=33 . Assuming 9 % loss follow-up , final sample size n=360 study participant , n=120 comparison group . Participants randomize 1 3 group : 1 ) 8-week training program mindfulness meditation , 2 ) attention , duration location-matched program progressive exercise , 3 ) non-interventional wait-list control group . Each cohort observe 8 month comprise annual cold flu season . Enrollment , randomization study intervention begin September year . Participants monitor weekly self-report May . Summers use data cleaning , preliminary analysis , recruit next year 's cohort . The primary goal project determine whether behavioral training mindfulness meditation moderate intensity sustain exercise lead reduction acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) illness , common cold influenza like illness . The primary outcome severity-weighted total day ARI illness ( global severity ) , calculate trapezoidal approximation area time severity curve ARI illness , severity assess daily use self-reports validate Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey ( WURSS-24 ) . Computer-assisted weekly monitoring assure ARI illness episode detect , serve document secondary outcome , include health care utilization work school absenteeism . Visits health care facility time lose work school document , classify ARI-related ( ) personnel blind allocation . Questionnaire measure assess perceive stress , self-efficacy , sleep quality , depression , general mental physical health also analyze secondary outcome . Degree stress reduction , mindfulness , positive negative emotion , social support , self-efficacy sleep quality analyze potential mediator effect intervention outcomes . Laboratory assess objective measure primarily serve corroborate self-reports disease severity , also analyze potential mediator effect behavioral intervention ARI illness incidence , duration , severity . As potential mediator , pro-inflammatory cytokine ( CRP , IL-6 , IL-8 , IP-10 ) assess change baseline one month 8 week behavioral intervention finish . These serve indicator pro-inflammatory state . Repeating assay 3 month later ass whether pro-inflammatory change baseline sustain . Cytokines sample take ARI illness assess corroborate biomarkers disease severity . Identification viral agent use multiplex PCR also serve corroborate ARI self-reports . Self-report measure perceive stress , positive negative emotion , self-efficacy , social support , sleep quality , mindfulness , general mental physical health use assess potential pathway intervention may exert influence primary outcome . Potential mediating effect psychological physical health domain assess use appropriate mediation ( process ) analysis statistical model . Primary efficacy analysis contrast total day illness area-under-curve global severity intervention group correspond value control group . Unadjusted contrast do t-test , use variable transformation skewness require . Adjusted analysis base zero-inflated regression model take account episodic variable nature ARI illness . Zero-inflated regression model incorporate logistic sub-model account people without ARI illness , linear sub-model account variability continuous measure severity duration . These employ conservative estimate standard error inflate use Huber/White maximum likelihood estimation . Co-variates control model include : age , sex , body mass index , smoke status , comorbidity , high level education achieve , neuroticism , conscientiousness , general physical health general mental health . The null hypotheses `` effect primary outcome '' reject favor alternative hypothesis `` effect '' p-values â‰¤0.025 . Confidence interval construct outcome variable , allow estimation effect size . Zero-inflated regression model primary efficacy analyse do use M-Plus version 6.1or similar software . Influence intervention secondary outcome assess use ANOVA-based multivariate regression model use SAS software . Adjustment multiple comparison incorporate , interpretation cautious . In general , investigator ' want see relationship p &lt; 0.01 order justify tentative null hypothesis rejection . Pre-planned secondary efficacy analysis include effect intervention : 1 ) absenteeism , 2 ) health care utilization , 3 ) general physical health ( SF-12 ) , 4 ) general mental health ( SF-12 ) ; 5 ) perceive stress ( PSS-10 ) , 6 ) self-efficacy ( MSES , ESE ) , 7 ) sleep quality ( PSQI ) , 8 ) body weight ( BMI ) , 9 ) blood pressure 10 ) pro-inflammatory cytokine . One-sided test base underlying hypothesis behavioral training lead improved physical mental health , sleep quality self-efficacy , reduction absenteeism , health care utilization , stress , body weight , blood pressure proinflammatory cytokine . Apart flu shot , hand-washing , smoke avoidance , maintenance general health , know safe effective prevention strategy acute viral respiratory infection . Interventions test low risk , likely confer benefit harm . Influenza vaccination ( flu shot ) provide free charge participant , could consider benefit . Participants require forego proven accept prevention treatment , fact encourage seek appropriate medical attention condition , include respiratory infection , continue regular health care practice . Antibiotics , anti-influenza antiviral , ARI treatment disallow , instead track secondary outcome . In general , participant ask continue study intervention assign , forego study intervention assign . However , inform remain free make health care , behavioral life style decision . In particular , exercise discourage participant meditation wait-list control group , exercise know confer health benefit . However , investigator ' ask participant exercise control group refrain start meditation program , participant refrain start purportedly immune-modifying supplement ( eg , echinacea , ginseng , zinc , elderberry , etc . ) , unless advise physician . If participant choose actively begin intervention assign ( i.e . person randomize exercise chooses take mindfulness meditation course instead ) , investigator ' ask continue study , use `` cross-over '' information secondary analysis use principle outline Section 4.3 protocol . This propose study submit approve Human Subjects Committee Health Sciences Institutional Review Board University Wisconsin - Madison ( UW HS-IRB ) , compliance HIPAA federally mandate human subject regulation . All member research team complete protection human subject ' tutorial require UW HS-IRB 's Human Subjects Committee prior study 's initiation . All name UW Co-Investigators , Consultants , current Project Personnel fact already complete tutorial . All study personnel , include research assistant , trained confidentiality , inform consent procedure , aspect human subject protection . A Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) oversee human subject recruitment monitoring , function independently principal investigator co-investigators . The investigator ' expect committee function similarly establish first MEPARI trial , choose meet twice yearly monitor recruitment retention , provide oversight guidance relation safety , bioethics , human subject concern may arise . Acute infection influenza respiratory viruses lead much human suffer loss economic productivity . The investigator ' evidence suggest train either meditation exercise may lead substantial reduction ARI disease burden work absenteeism . In addition test whether investigator ' finding replicable large sample refine methodology , propose comparative effectiveness translational research investigate mechanism action provide initial estimate cost-effectiveness . If positive finding confirm , line research could direct immediate impact public private health-related policy clinical practice , well scientific understand respiratory infection .
