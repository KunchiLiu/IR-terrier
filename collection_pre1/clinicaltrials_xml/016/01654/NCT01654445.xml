	<brief_summary>This trial enroll patient diagnose transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) minor stroke occur within past 12 hour . Anyone diagnose minor stroke face possibility long-term disability even death , regardless treatment . Stroke symptom weakness , difficulty speak paralysis may improve worsen hour day immediately follow stroke . The purpose research trial study effect clot-dissolving drug , tenecteplase ( TNK-tPA ) , treatment patient arrive within twelve hour stroke onset . This study attempt see TNK-tPA give vein arm ( intravenous ) patient safe treatment stroke patient . Neither safety effectiveness treatment proven yet . This trial conduct several site Canada . Dr Michael Hill Dr. Shelagh Coutts Principal Investigators trial , coordinate University Calgary , Foothills Medical Centre .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TNK-tPA Evaluation Minor Ischemic Stroke With Proven Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective TEMPO-1 demonstrate safety feasibility use TNK-tPA ( tenecteplase ) , thrombolytic agent relatively novel treatment ischemic stroke well-established treatment myocardial infarction , treat minor ischemic stroke patient proven acute symptomatic occlusion . Up 80 % ischemic stroke minor initially non-disabling . These patient present transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) minor stroke.An overwhelming majority treat thrombolysis consider `` good treat '' physician . TEMPO-1 enroll patient within 12 hour time window NIHSS score &lt; 6 ASPECTS &gt; 5 . Patients must intracranial occlusion CTA . Study drug must administer within 90 minute first slice CTA . This open- label , multi-centre trial , dose- escalated trial . A total 50 patient enrol , 25 per tier . There two dose tier 0.1 mg/kg 0.25 mg/kg . Advancement second dose-tier dependent upon safe completion 1st dose tier approval DSMB . Patients undergo study CT angiogram intracranial circulation 4-8 hour treatment determine biological effect drug - whether occlude artery recanalized . Patients assess 24 48 hour , Days 5 , 30 , 90 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Acute ischemic stroke adult patient ( 18 year age old ) 2 . Onset ( lastseenwell ) time treatment time &lt; 12 hour . 3 . Minor stroke define baseline NIHSS &lt; 6 time randomization . Patients must demonstrable neurological deficit physical neurological examination . 4 . Any acute intracranial occlusion ( MCA , ACA , PCA , VB territory ) define noninvasive acute imaging ( CT angiography ) neurologically relevant presenting symptom sign . An acute occlusion define TICI 0 TICI 1 flow . 5 . Prestroke independent functional status activity daily live prestroke estimate modify Barthel Index 90 great AND premorbid mRS 0 1 . 6 . Informed consent patient surrogate . 7 . Patients treat within 90 minute CT/CTA complete . 1 . Hyperdensity NCCT consistent intracranial hemorrhage . Any clinical suspicion intracranial hemorrhage even absence visible blood baseline brain imaging . 2 . Large acute stroke &gt; 1/3 MCA territory ASPECTS &lt; 5 visible baseline CT scan . 3 . Core establish infarction . No area grey matter hypodensity similar less density white matter judgment enrol neurologist consistent subacute ischemic stroke &gt; 12 hour age . 4 . Clinical history , past image clinical judgment suggest intracranial occlusion chronic . 5 . Patient candidate receive standard care IV tPA . 6 . Stroke occur inpatient . An inpatient person officially admit hospital ward bed . A patient ED formally admit still consider outpatient . 7 . Patient severe fatal disabling illness prevent improvement followup treatment would likely benefit patient . 8 . Patient complete followup due comorbid nonfatal illness visit host site city return followup . 9 . Pregnancy . 10 . Patient actively take dual antiplatelet medication ( aspirin &amp; clopidogrel ) last 48 hour . 11. International normalized ratio &gt; 1.4 12 . Standard thrombolysis exclusion ( Taken Canadian guidelines1 )</criteria>
