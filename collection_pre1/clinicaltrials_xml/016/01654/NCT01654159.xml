	<brief_title>Assessment Visual Function Optics Intraocular Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cataract occur natural lens eye , play major role focus light production sharp visual image , becomes cloudy hardens , result loss visual function . Left untreated , cataract cause preventable blindness . During cataract surgery natural lens remove man-made intraocular lens ( IOL ) implant place . IOL technology advance significantly recent year result main goal cataract surgery longer simply successful removal cloudy lens restoration vision . Providing patient best possible refractive outcome best possible visual quality much important assess surgery outcomes . Aspheric , multifocal accommodating IOLs among new design develop improve visual outcome cataract surgery . In order ass effectiveness design , visual function need evaluate objectively subjectively follow implantation . Such evaluation allows continue evolution IOL design towards optimum . This propose research study , aim assess visual function optical performance new CE mark IOLs implantation , could significantly contribute enhancement development improve IOL design future . We successfully conduct similar patient trial past 5 year . As new IOL design constantly develop , approve CE mark , type research study always potential offer new information currently available previously assess publish could contribute towards improve IOL design future . All outcome measure capture 3-6 month surgery</detailed_description>

Potential best correct visual acuity 6/12 better ( visual function patient affect ocular pathology ) . Subjects clear intraocular medium cataract ( assess cataract ) . General physical mental condition allow participation current study . Subjects willing participate evidence sign write informed Prior surgery select eye Previous uveitis trauma select eye , anterior posterior synechiae Potential best correct visual acuity bad 6/12 ( since may indicate cause ocular pathology ) Partial total paralysis , Parkinsons syndrome , cerebrovascular accident condition could impact result study Subject 85 year age ( ocular pathology common age group ) Subjects without adequate physical mental capacity enable participation study Subject unwilling participate Systemic topical medication know influence visual function measure</criteria>
