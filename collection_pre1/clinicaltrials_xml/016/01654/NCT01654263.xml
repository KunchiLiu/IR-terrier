	<brief_summary>The propose phase IIb randomize , open label , dose ranging , safety immunogenicity study evaluate two different dos 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) two group participant ( 55 74 year age ) . First group vaccine na誰ve participant open-label receive single injection 0.5 mL PCV13 . Second group participant previously vaccinate 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV23 ) randomize 1:1 receive two injection 0.5 mL PCV13 , one dose arm ( Group IIA Group IIB ) . Blood sample obtain baseline , one month six month post-vaccination . The primary objective : determine two 0.5 mL dos PCV13 statistically significantly immunogenic single 0.5 mL dose PCV13 least vaccine serotypes among participant 55 74 year age previously vaccinate PPSV23 , measure serotype-specific OPA titer 28 day study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IIb , Open-Label , Dose Ranging Study 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Adults 55 Through 74 Years Age Previously Vaccinated With 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase IIb open-label immunogenicity safety study evaluate dosage 0.5 mL 1.0 mL ( give two 0.5 mL injection separate arm ) PCV13 adult 55 74 year age previously vaccinate PPSV23 . The study enroll two group participant . Group I participants receive open-label dose 0.5 mL PCV13 include 294 adult 55-74 year age previously receive 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV23 ) . Group II randomize 1:1 receive 0.5 mL PCV13 ( Group IIA ) 0.5 mL PCV13 right arm 0.5 mL PCV 13 leave arm ( Group IIB ) . Group II include 588 adult 55 74 year age previously receive single dose PPSV23 &gt; /=3 year &lt; /=7 year prior enrollment . Enrollment group stratify age group ( 55 64 year 65 74 year ) .The study duration approximately 18 month . The primary objective : determine two 0.5 mL dos PCV13 statistically significantly immunogenic single 0.5 mL dose PCV13 least vaccine serotypes among participant 55 74 year age previously vaccinate PPSV23 , measure serotype-specific OPA titer 28 day study vaccination , non-inferior 12 vaccine serotypes ; determine two 0.5 mL dos PCV13 administer participant previously vaccinate PPSV23 non-inferior single dose 0.5 mL PCV13 administer vaccine-na誰ve adult 55 74 year age 12 vaccine serotypes , measure serotype-specific OPA titer 28 day study vaccination . The secondary objective study : determine two x 0.5mL dos PCV13 statistically significantly immunogenic single 0.5 mL dose PCV13 least vaccine serotypes among participant 55 74 year age previously vaccinate PPSV23 , measure serotype-specific OPA titer 180 day study vaccination , non-inferior 12 vaccine serotypes ; determine two x 0.5mL dos PCV13 administer participant previously vaccinate PPSV23 non-inferior single dose 0.5 mL PCV13 administer vaccine-na誰ve adult 55 74 year age 12 vaccine serotypes , measure serotype-specific OPA titer 180 day study vaccination .
