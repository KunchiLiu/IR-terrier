	<brief_summary>The purpose study dermine whether local-water filter infrared-A ( wIRA ) irradiation reduce postoperative wound infection . wIRA irradiation apply 20min directly preoperatively , patient underwent abdominal surgery . The wIRA harmless light source , describe . We test impact clinical outcome patient undergo one-time preoperative wIRA irradiation postoperative wound healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wound heal complex pathophysiological process relate pain , discomfort immobility patient well control may lead devastate morbidity relate wound infection . Furthermore , prolong hospital stay , increase pain consecutive increase drug consumption often associate postoperative wound infection . Although average cost wind infection difficult ass , doubt prophylactic tool control postoperative wound heal would tremendous potential . Recent study indicate application different form thermal energy skin surface decrease postoperative wound infection significantly . It known high-normal arterial oxygen tension level decrease surgical wound infection 11 % 5 % . The application water-filtered infrared A ( wIRA ) irradiation successfully applied patient ulcus cruris superficial skin-tumors alleviate pain regulation body temperature neonatology . The simple preoperative whole body warm 30 min surgery result statistically reduce occurrence postoperative wound infection . A recent study show beneficial effect postoperative wIRA application wound heal . The effect wIRA lead success therapy explain thermal non-thermal effect . A major advantage wIRA vs. application simple warm blanket lie upon effective penetration wIRA apply energy within deep subcutaneous tissue depth 2-3 cm . Further effect apply energy lead vasodilation capillary consecutive effective conduction energetic blood flow deeper tissue layer . Non-thermal effect wIRA application consist direct stimulation active immunomodulation specialize immune cell . Furthermore , wIRA induce protective protein , e.g . ferritin skin potentially influence common cross-talks within cell extracellular matrix . These effect display regulatory role wound repair process may also responsible positive cosmetic result . More important clinical assessment wound heal early phase hospitalization effect wIRA significantly reduce postoperative pain . Surgery postoperative pain evoke stress related effect induce profound neuroendocrine change cytokine activity relate process . Increased blood flow , due vasodilation , help strongly eliminate accumulated pain mediator , lactic acid potential bacterial toxin . The metabolism induce mediates also non-thermal effect attraction immune cell potential effect nociceptors . These direct effect wIRA easily follow postoperative irradiation perform . The problem develop wound infection may rely within first hour already operation , wound get `` precondition '' potential mediator bacteria may lead postoperative encounter wound infection . A recent study indicate immediate postoperative warm 2 hour hernia surgery may provide comparable benefit seven day warm . According idea prevent deleterious precondition process wound healing , test , one time preoperative application wIRA impact postoperative wound healing related clinical question . Comparable preoperative antibiotic single shot treatment rely expansive impact preoperative wIRA application . The prospective randomized control clinical trial design study effect single time preoperative wIRA irradiation postoperative outcome wound infection visceral surgery .</detailed_description>
