	<brief_summary>Cocoa flavanols form part family chemical ( also find red wine tea ) arouse interest due population study suggest diet high substance might reduce risk heart disease . In laboratory , flavanols show cause blood vessel widen blood flow increase . As dysfunction ability blood vessel widen think play central role complication diabetes , novel way mitigate constantly seek . The present study aim use non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure foot brain blood flow 7 day consumption cocoa drink high flavanols , subject diabetes , without peripheral neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Flavanol-rich Cocoa Peripheral Cerebral Blood Flow Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocoa flavanols form part family polyphenols ( also find red wine tea ) arouse interest due epidemiological study suggest diet high substance might reduce risk heart disease . However , difficult account source polyphenols epidemiological study , level cocoa product consumption generally well document . Furthermore , readily available cocoa product , processing may remove flavanols , lead product vary considerably flavanol content . Recently , laboratory study effect cocoa flavanols suggest effect relaxation smooth muscle blood vessel wall , specifically element mediate endothelium ( blood vessel wall ) . Studies use ultrasound method healthy volunteer show increase blood flow arm follow temporary arterial occlusion . As endothelial dysfunction think play central role complication diabetes , novel way mitigate constantly seek . It well recognise diabetic peripheral nerve damage lead abnormal foot blood flow , include impaired superficial skin blood flow , one factor delay wound heal diabetic foot ulcer ( single large cost secondary care diabetes ) . Several technique currently use monitor blood flow limb , include venous occlusion plethysmography ( VOP ) , laser Doppler method nuclear medicine technique . These technique low spatial resolution , low specificity , labour intensive , require use injected radioactive contrast agent ( pose particular risk diabetic patient ) . Radiation dose also limit repeat study . The arterial spin label magnetic resonance ( ASL MR ) technique non-invasive , yield quantifiable measure blood flow high resolution , allow measurement repeat several time , technique use external contrast agent . The present study aim use non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure peripheral ( foot ) brain blood flow baseline response cocoa drink high flavanols , subject type 2 diabetes , without peripheral neuropathy . Subjects attend initial screen visit . Measures HbA1c , kidney function blood pressure check , along ankle-brachial pressure index ( check poor circulation ) , foot pulse , examination peripheral nerve damage cardiac neuropathy .</detailed_description>
