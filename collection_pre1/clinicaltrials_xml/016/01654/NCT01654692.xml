	<brief_title>A Combination Ipilimumab Fotemustine Treat Unresectable Locally Advanced Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy , chemotherapy chemotherapy combination currently effective accept systemic treatment metastatic melanoma . However , significant prolonged response rare . The trial determine additional benefit achieve add fotemustine anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab . It assume mechanism ipilimumab augments effect chemotherapy animal model relies ability cytotoxic agent induce apoptosis tumor cell . These apoptotic cell function potent inducer immune response non-tolerized antigen contain . Thus , chemotherapy may create vivo autologous tumor vaccine . Ipilimumab prevent regulation immune response , allow tumor rejection . Animal model evaluate combination anti-CTLA4 antibody chemotherapy give brief acute treatment chemotherapy - presumably adequate induce tumor apoptosis , inadequate induce significant prolonged tumor rejection . Since patient metastatic melanoma generally require therapy within relatively short period time , protocol allow use fotemustine . Standard dose fotemustine use optimize chance tumor control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis malignant melanoma Stage III ( unresectable ) Stage IV melanoma Maximum 1 line chemotherapy advance disease allow No prior chemotherapy within 4 week treatment start ( 6 week case nitrosourea ) No previous systemic corticosteroid therapy within 10 day Prior adjuvant treatment IFN immunotherapy allow Asymptomatic brain metastasis allow Measurable disease Prior treatment brain metastasis . In case stereotactic radiotherapy ( surgery ) applicable , whole brain radiotherapy perform Life expectancy &gt; = 16 week ECOG performance status 0 1 Normal laboratory test require Negative screening test HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. Men woman , 18 year old . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 8 week study manner risk pregnancy minimize . Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 5 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ cervix ; Primary ocular mucosal melanoma . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Symptomatic brain metastasis require immediate local intervention ( radiotherapy ( RT ) and/or surgery ) Autoimmune disease Any underlying medical condition , opinion investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation adverse event , condition associate frequent diarrhea . Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies Concomitant therapy anticancer agent Immunosuppressive agent Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 1 month prior dose study drug ) ; surgery radiotherapy ; investigational anticancer therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ; Previous treatment investigational product , include cancer immunotherapy , within 30 day ; Previous enrollment another clinical trial prior treatment CD137 agonist antiCTLA4 and/or fotemustine .
