	<brief_summary>Of 5.7 million stroke survivor United States , 80 % exhibit significant weakness one arm ( call `` hemiparesis '' ) . This devastating impairment undermines performance value activity quality life . Although rehabilitation commonly provide , conventional affected arm rehabilitative strategy negative evidence , evidence , support use . Thus , remain need evidence-based rehabilitative strategy arm hemiparesis . Newer rehabilitative approach emphasize repetitive , task-specific practice ( RTP ) incorporate affected arm . However , many promising regimen require participation intensive therapy , efficacious least impaired patient . Thus , remain need efficacious , practical RTP technique address moderate affect arm hemiparesis . To address shortfall , one investigator team member pilot innovative brace integrate electromyography ( EMG ) robotics . In case series , 8 stroke patient exhibit moderate arm impairment successfully participate RTP , brace ( call `` Myomo '' ) detect augment movement attempt . Aided Myomo , participation RTP regimen reduce subject ' affected arm impairment spasticity . The next logical step test Myomo + RTP efficacy use randomize control method appropriate sample size .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic Brace Incorporating Electromyography Moderate Affected Arm Impairment After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective small efficacy study collect randomize , control pilot data estimate clinical effectiveness combine , EMG/robotics approach conjunction RTP . A unique adjunct acquisition biomechanical data outcome measure . Based pilot data , central hypothesis Myomo therapy RTP exhibit significant impairment reduction . We test central hypothesis accomplish objective pursuing follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : Compare efficacy Myomo + RTP RTP Myomo affect arm impairment . Thirty stroke patient exhibit moderate affected arm deficit randomly assign receive : ( ) Myomo combine RTP ( Myomo + RTP ) ; ( b ) RTP ( RTP ) , constitute frequently use regimen clinical environment ; 2,3 ( c ) Myomo therapy ( Myomo ) . The current study design determine additive effect Myomo training RTP , also discern relative efficacy RTP Myomo use . The intended duration contact equivalent across group . Affected arm impairment , primary study outcome , measure upper extremity section Fugl-Meyer Impairment Scale ( FM ) , primary outcome measure . The FM administer blind rater twice intervention , immediately post-intervention ( POST ) , two month post-intervention ( POST-2 ) POST serve primary study endpoint . The primary study hypothesis subject Myomo + RTP group exhibit significantly large FM score change Myomo RTP subject POST . It also hypothesize change sustain POST-2 . Specific Aim 2 : Determine impact Myomo + RTP affect arm outcome . The investigator administer Arm Motor Ability Test ( AMAT ) , Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) subject intervention , POST , POST-2 . When compare score intervention , hypothesize Myomo + RTP subject exhibit significantly large AMAT score change , significantly large score change Amount Use Scale MAL , large score change Quality Movement scale MAL , large SIS score change , subject group POST . These difference sustain POST-2 . Specific Aim 3 : Estimate effect Myomo + RTP movement kinematics . Using kinematic protocol validate team,4 conduct movement performance experiment subset patient three group . Specifically , 5 patient group ( n=15 ) administer reach kinematics intervention POST . Kinematic data expect identify specific movement parameter affect stroke , intervention impact movement parameter ( e.g . reach path ; rate force production ) . Traditional , rater base , outcome measure may less able discern subtle motor change exhibit impaired stroke subject . Inclusion kinematic data study design overcome potential challenge within sample .</detailed_description>
