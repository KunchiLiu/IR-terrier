	<detailed_description>Overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding ( OGIB ) distinct clinical entity significantly bad outcome compare colonic bleed upper GI bleeding . The mortality rate patient acute small bowel bleed 10 % .1 Recently , meta-analysis 10 study show VCE DBE equivalent diagnosis yield patient obscure GIB ( 62 % VCE 56 % DBE ) .2 The limitation meta-analysis study include study examine patient occult OGIB overt OGIB . Comparing occult OGIB , patient overt OGIB likely present significant lesion cause recurrent bleed subsequently increase risk morbidity mortality.3 According emergency endoscopy concept upper low GIB , patient overt OGIB demonstrate usefulness urgent VCE urgent DBE diagnosis tool impact clinical management.4-7 Although previous study show promising data use urgent enteroscopy , debate use VCE DBE first patient massive overt OGIB still uncertain . Thus study , conduct prospective study compare urgent VCE urgent DBE patient massive overt OGIB . Objective The objective study compare diagnostic yield urgent VCE urgent DBE patient massive overt OGIB . Patients Methods Patients Between October 2010 March 2012 , patient refer tertiary , King Memorial Chulalongkorn University Hospital evaluate GIB . The consecutive patient massive overt OGIB define visible gastrointestinal bleeding ( GIB ) ( eg , melena hemotochezia ) unknown origin persist initial negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) colonoscopy recruit . Massive define need least 3 unit blood transfusion . All patient underwent EGD colonoscopy within first 48 hr hospitalization . In case cause gastrointestinal bleeding identify , informed consent obtain enrolled patient . Exclusion criterion pregnancy , patient suspect intestinal obstruction stricture , cardiac pacemaker implantation electromedical device implantation , diabetic gastroparesis , history gastrectomy small bowel surgery . This study prospective study compare urgent VCE urgent DBE . VCE DBE perform within first 72 hr hospitalization . VCE carry 12 hr DBE . The independent operator perform VCE DBE . The VCE result blind DBE endoscopists . A positive finding consider finding could explain cause bleed and/or result correct therapeutic management include take biopsy sampling . A negative finding consider cause bleed detect recurrence bleed follow period . The result CE DBE evaluate whether total small bowel visualization . The diagnosis yield impact clinical outcome assess . CE procedure CE perform bedside accord manufacturer 's instruction ( MiroCam , Intromedic Co. , Seoul , Republic Korea ) . The technical description CE documented.8 The capsule complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor image acquisition rate 3 frame per second . As result power saving measure , recorder incorporates two external electrode single skin electrode electric data conduction across body avoids need radiofrequency transmission.8 Patients ingest 2L polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) small bowel preparation . Patients allow drink clear liquid 2 hr swallow capsule . No medication ( prokinetic drug , simethicone ) give examination . The small bowel transit time define time passage capsule pylorus arrival capsule cecum . The boundary jejunum ileum define half-time small bowel transit . 9 The positive finding VCE define either visualization lesion include angioectasia , mass ulcer presence blood and/or blood clot small bowel lumen . The term negative finding define abnormality non-specific finding red spot , erosion visible submucosal vein . DBE procedure The standard DBE system ( Fujinon Inc , Saitama , Japan ) use examination . The system consist high resolution endoscope ( Fujinon EN-450T5/20 ) 200-cm work length , 8.5 mm outer diameter 145-cm flexible overtube 12 mm outer diameter . The endoscope 's work channel 2.2 mm diameter . Two latex balloon attach tip enteroscope overtube inflate deflate air pressure control system . The technique describe detail previously Yamamoto et al.10 The initial oral approach usually select . Whilst , anal approach perform initially patient suspect ileum lesion present hematochezia . The anal approach perform session initial route negative . In case approach consider , small bowel mucosa mark submucosal India ink injection use injection catheter distal part oral approach proximal part anal approach . DBE perform conscious sedation midazolam and/or meperidine administration cardiorespiratory monitor experience endoscopists . If bleeding cause detect , endoscopic treatment use achieve hemostasis include argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) , injection clipping . Biopsy take whenever possible . In case tumor find , India ink mark submucosa around .</detailed_description>
