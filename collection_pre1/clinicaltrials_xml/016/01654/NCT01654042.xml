	<brief_summary>More 2 million patient North America treat warfarin - `` blood thinner '' - prevent blood clot artery vein . The treatment monitor blood test dose change accordingly every 1-4 week . One third patient stable result hardly ever change dose . The investigator wish show level control treatment warfarin stable patient bad 12-weekly testing . A pilot study investigator perform indicated 12-weekly testing would safe confirm large study . One third patient take warfarin change dose past 6 month longer . These patient ask participation study . They randomize test dose every 4 12 week . Each patient study end , minimum 1 year 4 year . The study design show 12-weekly test significantly increase risk major bleed blood clot . The result would important large number patient . An increase interval blood test 4 12 week would reduce burden patient life-long treatment considerably .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolongation Interval Between Prothrombin Time Tests Stable Patients II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomize , control , open-label , multi-center non-inferiority trial demonstrate interval internation normalize ration ( INR ) test extend recommend 4 week 12 week patient stable INRs . PROBE design . Patients receive warfarin therapy exhibit INR stability , define change maintenance dose least 6 month , potentially eligible enrolment study . The primary outcome composite major bleeding ( ISTH criterion ) plus objectively verified arterial venous thromboembolism ( exclude superficial thrombophlebitis ) plus death related thromboembolism . Justification : study reflect `` trade-off '' scenario one regimen expect effective cost increase harm compare regimen . Conversely , potential disadvantage experimental regimen trial increase variability INR , may result increased rate low well high INRs therefore potentially increase type clinical event .</detailed_description>
