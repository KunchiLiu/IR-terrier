	<brief_summary>For HIV-infected patient access treatment , liver disease major cause morbidity mortality . Hepatitis C frequently encounter liver condition population . Both disease allow high level poisonous substance ( toxin ) normally produce bacteria present gut enter bloodstream . This lead chronic inflammatory state , result faster development liver scar ( fibrosis ) ultimately , end stage disease ( cirrhosis ) . To prevent happening , use antibiotic attempt reduce quantity gut flora hop lower amount toxin produce . These trial show promising result , antibiotic study major side effect design continuous use . Rifaximin non absorbable antibiotic side effect . It already use long period time cirrhotic patient treat effect cirrhosis brain ( encephalopathy ) . This project try determine rifaximin , reduce level toxin produce bacteria gut , improve evolution liver fibrosis HIV-infected patient hepatitis C. In pilot study , ten patient HIV HCV infection follow one year . In addition , 10 patient HCV mono infection also follow . Both population include start rifaximin , currently approve FDA indication ( hepatic encephalopathy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Antibiotic ( Rifaximin ) Liver Scarring HIV-Infected Patients With Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many study already prove deleterious effect LPS HIV hepatic disease evolution . There never concert effort prevent progression liver disease patient . To date , treatment initiation antiretroviral therapy . Rifaximin could easy well tolerated way improve outcome liver disease HIV-infected patient . We hypothesize could help slow progression liver disease stage patient . This pilot study . A total twenty patient place rifaximin physician mild hepatic encephalopathy monitor period one year . The evaluation fibrosis do transient elastography every 3 month . Bacterial translocation evaluate dose soluble CD14 . The safety prolong use rifaximin patient also assess .</detailed_description>
