	<detailed_description>The purpose project evaluate role gadoxetate ( Eovist ) enhance dual-energy CT well evaluate perihilar cholangiocarcinoma , exploit combination physiologic behavior gadoxetate liver tissue combine advantageous mass attenuation coefficient Gadolinium achievable dual energy technique . This combination unique CT imaging sensitivity , high resolution differential enhancement potentially allow improved visualization detection tumor relative enhance surround hepatic parenchyma ductal anatomy hepatobiliary phase , due biliary excretion agent . Cholangiocarcinoma hepatic adenocarcinoma arises bile duct epithelium second prevalent liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma . The hilar intrahepatic variety cholangiocarcinoma present infiltrative , exophytic , polypoid lesion . Most extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas infiltrative , cause focal stricture bile duct result proximal biliary ductal dilatation . While magnetic resonance ( MR ) cholangiography diagnostic majority patient malignant hilar stricture , evaluation limit spatial resolution patient , inability MRI scan . Standard Multi Detector CT ( MDCT ) use iodinate contrast agent , hand , limited evaluation cholangiocarcinomas , due lack consistent enhancement tumor iodinate contrast . Single-source , Dual-Energy ( SSDE ) Spectral MDCT utilize single fast switch x-ray beam source acquire near simultaneous data set two different photon energy single acquisition . Data acquire 80 kilovolt peak ( kVp ) 140 kVp image reconstruction achievable selectable monochromatic presentation range 40 - 140 kiloelectron volt ( keV ) , typically 70-78 keV diagnostic image presentation . At low tube voltage , frequency photoelectric interaction increase exponentially strongly dependent atomic number . Therefore , substances high atomic number , iodine gadolinium increase frequency photoelectric k-edge interaction low tube voltage substantially increase CT attenuation , thus improve contrast . Gadolinium unique k-edge attenuation approximately 53 keV , within available monochromatic reconstruction range , thus allow significant great detectability . Additional material decomposition technique allow unique material presentation analysis gadolinium/ water pair analysis high spatial resolution . Dual-Energy technology limit type contrast agent currently available , base Iodine . Gadoxetate ( Eovist ) relatively new Gadolinium base MRI contrast agent capable produce standard appear MRI image hepatic arterial portal venous phase , also provide opportunity well visualize bile duct liver parenchyma excrete liver biliary system hepatobiliary phase . This pilot project aim address long-term pitfall imaging cholangiocarcinomas , provide high resolution delineation often infiltrative tumor single-source , Dual-Energy Spectral MDCT , capitalize improve spatial resolution achievable MDCT compare MRI time produce non-invasive CT cholangiogram aid accurate diagnosis treatment planning cholangiocarcinoma , particularly , hilar variety .</detailed_description>
