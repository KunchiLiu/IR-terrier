	<brief_title>FV-EUS Endoscope Versus CLA-EUS EUS-FNA Solid Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , forward view linear echoendoscope ( FV-EUS ) develop aim potentially expand therapeutic application EUS . This prototype modification CLA scope characterize primarily shift orientation endoscopic US view oblique forward . The US transducer locate adjacent work channel , endoscope tip , display forward-viewing image along scan plane parallel insertion direction 90Â° scanning range . It 3.7 mm work channel without elevator , allow exit FNA needle accessory use parallel longitudinal axis scope . Preliminary experience scope report potential advantage conventional linear scope ( CLA-EUS ) pseudocysts drainage hilar biliary stricture . Moreover , large experience still unpublished Catholic University , Rome , Italy use FV-EUS FNA solid cystic lesion throughout GI tract show FV-EUS highly effective performance seem least comparable CLA-EUS . To date , however , data compare performance scope FNA target lesion available good clarify advantage disadvantage one scope . We design randomize comparative trial patient randomize undergo examination CLA-EUS FV-EUS . In case failure : ( ) visualization presume lesion ; ( ii ) failure perform FNA scope use base randomization , second attempt make use scope .</detailed_description>
