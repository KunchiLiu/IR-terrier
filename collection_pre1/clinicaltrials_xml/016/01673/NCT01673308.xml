	<brief_title>Lenalidomide After Failure Hypomethylating Agents Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There standard therapy failure hypomethylating agent provide supportive care include transfusion cytokine therapy . Lenalidomide treatment choice case MDS 5q deletion . A study lenalidomide non-5q deletion MDS patient show transfusion independency rate 26 % relatively acceptable suggest lenalidomide could use non-5q deletion MDS patient . There datum second-line lenalidomide therapy hypomethylating agent . MDS highly complex pathogenesis background distinctive subtype therapy treatment drug distinctive subgroup response . In fact investigator n't know patient responsive hypomethylating agent lenalidomide except 5q deletion . This suggest second line therapy first line failure MDS different type relapsed/refractory disease tend resistant subsequent therapy . In regard , possibility relatively high response rate second line lenalidomide select subset fail hypomethylation therapy patient responsive regardless treatment line . Recent data suggest MDS JAK2 mutation responsive lenalidomide . The investigator analyze JAK2 mutation status response evaluation .</detailed_description>
