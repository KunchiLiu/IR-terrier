	<brief_summary>Description : This multi-institutional study investigate sensitivity negative predictive value sentinel lymph node map robotic assist near infrared image cervical injection indocyanine green ( ICG ) dye woman stage I endometrial cervical cancer time robotic surgical staging . Patients receive cervical injection 1mg ICG induction anesthesia follow sentinel lymph node map use robotic assist fluorescence imaging . The sentinel lymph node identify remove sent ultraprocessing pathology . The non-sentinel pelvic para-aortic ( indicate ) non-sentinel node remove sent routine pathologic process accord standard care surgical procedure . The pathologic result sentinel non-sentinel node evaluated sensitivity negative predictive value ability detect metastatic disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Brief Summary : Patients early stage endometrial cervical cancer undergo robotic surgery remove uterus , cervix lymph node dye inject cervix asleep anesthesia prior perform surgery . During surgery , surgeon activate robotic camera use visualize internal organ change special mode image call near infrared imaging . The near infrared imaging allow surgeon see dye inject cervix spread . The dye travel vessel call lymphatic channel nodule call `` sentinel lymph node '' . These tissue surgeon interested removing order see spread cancer nodule . The dye travel lymph node make easily visible surgeon . Without dye , node indistinguishable surround fatty tissue . The node dye remove patient sent pathologist , closely examine , call ultrasectioning , cancer spread . The surgeon remove remain lymphatic tissue ( fatty lymphatic tissue surround sentinel lymph node stain dye ) , `` non-sentinel lymph node '' , tissue traditionally remove endometrial cervical cancer surgery part standard care . These non-sentinel lymph node also examine evidence cancer spread . The researcher compare pathology result sentinel nodes non-sentinel node . The researcher hypothesize sentinel node contain cancer cell least 90 % time cancer find non-sentinel node .</detailed_description>
