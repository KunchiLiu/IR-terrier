	<brief_summary>The diagnostic work-up patient suspect neuroendocrine tumour ( NETs ) traditionally challenge issue . The last two decade mark application use diagnosis NETs 3 newly available diagnostic technique : endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) , multidetector CT ( MDCT ) , recently , positron emission tomography use 68Ga-labelled octreotide analogue ( PET ) . In prospective study conduct single referral centre compare PET conventional somatostatin receptor scintigraphy MDCT diagnosis , stag follow-up patient affected NET , PET detect primary secondary lesion method . Recent study investigate clinical impact PET management patient affected NET , previously study MDCT . The investigator recently report result investigation 19 patient suspected primary pancreatic NET study PET , MDCT EUS . The investigator preliminary data suggest PET may slightly sensitive MDCT detect small ( &lt; 2cm ) pancreatic lesion ; accuracy PET EUS probably similar . No prospective study yet devote evaluate accuracy PET diagnosis stag primary duodenal-pancreatic NETs . Furthermore , clinical impact adjunct PET traditional protocol diagnosis stag tumour wait thoroughly evaluate . Thus appropriate place PET diagnostic algorithm patient suspect duodenal-pancreatic NET remains undefined . The main aim project prospectively compare accuracy PET MDCT diagnosis stag patient suspect duodenal-pancreatic NETs . The investigator hypothesise PET superior MDCT diagnosis neoplasm ( dimension study sample estimate order detect 10 % difference ) . The impact PET management plan affect patient also evaluate . As secondary endpoint study , investigator compare EUS , PET MDCT diagnosis primary duodenal-pancreatic NET . The study design multicentre , prospective , non-randomised clinical trial . All patient undergo MDCT , PET EUS fix order .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients affect proved MENI , neoplasm duodenalpancreatic area suspect . 2 . Patients clinical diagnosis carcinoid syndrome . 3 . Patients clinical diagnosis ZollingerEllison syndrome . 4 . Patients insulinoma , prove fasting test . 5 . Patient clinical picture laboratory finding suggest functional nonfunctional NET . 6 . Patients previously undergone surgery , include total subtotal pancreatectomy , duodenotomy , intend curative histologically confirm NET . 7 . Patients diagnosed NET metastasis unknown primary location disease . 8 . Patients undergoing diagnostic workup periduodenal pancreatic lesion incidentally find abdominal ultrasound ( perform suspicion NET ) ultrasonographic characteristic ( round , hypoechoic eggeye , well demarcate ) suspicious NET . 9 . Patients undergoing diagnostic workup periduodenal pancreatic lesion incidentally find TC ( perform suspicion NET ) radiological characteristic ( well demarcate , hypervascular ) suspicious NET . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patient unwilling , unable consent . 2 . Pregnancy , lactation . 3 . Age &lt; 18 year 4 . Known diagnosis duodenalpancreatic NET . 5 . Patients concomitant lifethreatening disease . 6 . Patients already undergone PET EUS , last six month . In particular patient exclude study , lesion duodenalpancreatic area , characteristic suspicious NET , incidentally diagnose PET , EUS , previously unsuspected diagnosis NET suggest EUSFNA pancreatic lesion . 7 . Patients previously undergone total gastrectomy pancreatectomy include study , undergo EUS .</criteria>
