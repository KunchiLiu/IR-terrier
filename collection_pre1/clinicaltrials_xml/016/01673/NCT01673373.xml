	<brief_title>Renal Stent Placement Treatment Renal Artery Stenosis Patients With Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-arm , multicenter clinical trial take place 25 US/ Outside US ( OUS ) sit . Primary endpoint determine show safety , effectiveness , clinical outcome iCAST™ RX Stent System . Safety effectiveness evaluate base primary patency rate 9-months per lesion basis evaluate performance goal publish study bare-metal stent . The primary clinical endpoint ass improvement Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) 9-months compare baseline Systolic Blood Pressure . Eligible subject undergo two-week Medical Documentation Screening period confirm resistant hypertension ( SBP ≥ 155mmHg ) maximum tolerable dos ≥ three anti-hypertensive medication least three distinct class drug , one must diuretic . There must document clinical evidence support likelihood angiographic finding &gt; 80 % whether Duplex Ultrasound ( DUS ) , Computed Tomography angiogram ( CTa ) , Magnetic Resonance angiogram ( MRa ) medical evidence . After meet screen clinical eligibility criterion , subject undergo baseline assessment angiographic eligibility . After angiographic documentation ≥ 80 % renal artery stenosis Fraction Flow Reserve ( FFR ) &lt; 0.8 confirmed , subject may enrol trial placement investigational device . The 9-month visit include follow-up DUS target renal artery . If DUS non-diagnostic due imaging problem , overlie bowel gas body habitus , second DUS may attempt . If DUS indicative ≥ 60 % stenosis determine core laboratory , second DUS remain non-diagnostic , contrast angiogram use assess degree restenosis cover stent ( ) . Clinical follow-up visit require enrolled subject 30-days , 9-months , 12-months , 24-months , 36-months . A 6-month 18-month visit occur via telephone collect medication usage Adverse Events ( AEs ) . The 36-month clinic office visit require final safety visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1 . Age ≥ 18 time inform consent . 2 . Subject subject 's legal representative inform nature trial , agree participate , sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /Ethics Committee ( EC ) approve Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . 3 . Subjects bilateral kidney solitary function kidney Renal Artery Stenosis least one kidney average Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 155mmHg . 4 . Subject history maximum tolerable dose ≥ 3 antihypertensive medication different class , one must diuretic ( least two week prior Medical Documentation Screening period ) . . A documented history minimum 3 month show reasonable aggressive effort manage hypertension prior consent . This must include use broad variety medication use fail tolerate . 5 . Subject must document clinical evidence support likelihood angiographic finding &gt; 80 % whether DUS , CTa , MRa medical evidence . 6 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class I , II , III time trial enrollment . NOTE : When subject bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis require stenting , recommend treat kidney iCAST™ RX Stent System index procedure . In event subject need renal stenting procedure stag renal protection , important Investigator treat second renal artery iCAST™ RX Stent System 30 day index procedure . If subject bilateral stenosis one lesion meet protocol inclusion criterion lesion treat per protocol . The recommendation NOT treat second nonqualifying lesion , however operator feel strongly indicate , treat per standard care 30days post index procedure order comply exclusion criterion # 10 . Subjects flash pulmonary edema allow trial meet Inclusion Exclusion criterion . Angiographic Anatomic 1 . Angiographic diameter renal artery stenosis ≥ 80 % involve unilateral bilateral renal artery . . The degree percent diameter stenosis lesion intend treat , must confirm via one follow method : i. Manual automate measurement caliper ii . Measured Flow Fraction Reserve ( FFR ) &lt; 0.8 use pressure wire iii . Measured translesional peak pressure gradient &gt; 21mmHg induced hyperemia via dopamine papaverine use 4Fr less catheter pressure wire . b . Subjects 6079 % angiographic stenosis confirm FFR &lt; 0.8 may enrol . 2 . Renal poletopole length &gt; 8cm ( per visual estimate ) . 3 . Target lesion length ≤ 16mm per vessel ( per visual estimate ) . 4 . Renal artery vessel diameter ≥ 5.0mm ≤ 7.0mm ( per visual estimate ) . 5 . Lesion originate ≤ 15mm renal ostium . General 1 .

Subject suffer stroke Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) past 3 month . 12 . Subject pregnant , lactating , childbearing potential plan become pregnant followup trial period . 13 . Subject significant valvular disease . 14 . Subject know significant proteinuria &gt; 2+ &gt; 2.0gm/d . 15 . Subject known bilateral upperextremity arterial stenosis result spuriously low arm pressure without ability gain reliable blood pressure measurement least one upper extremity . 16 .
