	<brief_summary>Worldwide , common cause chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) diabetes . Unlike past , south korea , diabetes account 40 % ESRD . According WHO report 1998 , 100 million people type 2 diabetes 1997 , expect increase 300 million people 2025 . In addition , expect survival time patient diabetes increase compare previous . In future , ESRD due type 2 diabetes expect significant impact health industry . Therefore , prevention progression CKD ESRD diabetic patient important aspect national health economic problem . How stop progression diabetic nephropathy part modern medicine solve . Strict glycemic control , blood pressure regulation , use renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) blocker inhibit development progression diabetic nephropathy . Microalbuminuria diabetic patient recognize predictor progression diabetic nephropathy . Thus , prevention elevate urinary albumin excretion important therapeutic target prevention renal cardiovascular event . In patient diabetes hypertension , drug block RAS use treat proteinuria , still large number patient proteinuria uncontrolled . In addition , ACE inhibitor ARB agent actually limited effect reduce risk cardiovascular renal outcome . Also , sulodexide pentoxyphylline reduce proteinuria weak evidence term efficacy safety . Therefore , introduction new alternative drug require . Already several study report calcitriol paricalcitol renal injury model renopreventive effect . In addition , diabetic renal injury mouse model report vitamin D receptor deficiency lead glomerulosclerosis . Inhibition RAS combination paricalcitol RAS inhibitor effectively prevent renal injury diabetic nephropathy . Recently , Dick de Zeeuw et al report addition paricalcitol RAS inhibition safely low residual albuminuria patient diabetic nephropathy . Recent study report elevated concentration serum marker TNFα Fas-pathways strongly associate decreased renal function diabetic patient . However , role marker early progressive renal function decline clear . Therefore , objective study identify renoprotective effect new treatment activate vitamin D ( Calcitriol ) indicate TNF-α-related anti-inflammatory action seek role important biomarker change TNFR diabetic nephropathy predict response treatment .</brief_summary>
