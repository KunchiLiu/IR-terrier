	<brief_title>Trial Portable Oxygen Cylinders Versus Battery Powered Portable Oxygen Concentrators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) limit activity daily live ( shopping , visit friend , go walk ) due exertional dyspnoea . State Government funding provide 4 oxygen cylinder deliver patient require portable oxygen per month . However , active motivate COPD patient often find gratis supply run well month . Recent technology develop battery power portable oxygen concentrators . The late model weigh less typical oxygen cylinder advantage battery plug plug car cigarette lighter outlet , power point house . This mean COPD patient potential far mobile far long period time visit friends almost infinitely recharge battery pack course travel . The late battery power oxygen device weigh 2kgs half oxygen cylinder . However , upfront expense device inevitably sound business case cost consideration ( amortization initial purchase price , recharge battery cost patient 's electricity etc ) need consideration . Also , assume device superior ( least good ) oxygen cylinder , pulse delivery oxygen technology i.e . oxygen deliver burst inspiration detect , unlike oxygen cylinder run continuously , one assume without rigorous evaluation mobility quality life necessarily good superior new device . Hence , quality life evaluation emphasis enjoy activity COPD patient essential well cost issue fund stakeholder ( i.e . hospital site specific fund ) . Should sound business case make ( i.e . improve quality life less cost longer period time ) , sound justification make funding body COPD patient well fund body shoulder less cost wider usage device follow evaluation project . The design randomise crossover COPD patient spend one month oxygen battery power concentrator device switch oxygen delivery . Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( Quality Life ) administer end month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Outpatients diagnose stable COPD currently prescribe use portable oxygen cylinder `` pulse '' oxygen delivery exertion . Comorbidities : major respiratory condition , cardiac substantial comorbidities significantly limit mobility independent COPD Baseline step test demonstrate reduced effect battery device compare oxygen cylinder .</criteria>
