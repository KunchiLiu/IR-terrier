	<brief_title>Phase II Study Gleevec/Imatinib Mesylate ( STI-571 , NCS 716051 ) Neurofibromatosis ( NF1 ) Patients With Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label Phase II Study determine efficacy Gleevec® neurofibromatosis ( NF1 ) patient plexiform neurofibromas secondary goal determine toxicity , tumor marker genetically define population . The rationale study arise response human murine NF1 cell Gleevec® vitro response single NF1 patient treat Gleevec® airway compression plexiform neurofibroma dramatic response previously see NF1 therapy . The plan therapy include oral dose Gleevec® 440 mg/m^2/day ( max 800 mg/day ) pediatric subject 800 mg/day adult patient . ( 25 % dose reduction significant toxicity ) . Treatment continue 6 month option continue long patient remain study provided patient show benefit treatment Gleevec® safety concern .</detailed_description>
