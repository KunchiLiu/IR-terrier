	<brief_title>Evaluation EUS-Guided 22 Gauge Core Biopsy Versus Fine-needle Aspiration Suspected Pancreatic Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) utilize decade evaluate endo-luminal adjacent tumor gastrointestinal tract . In time , EUS guide fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) emerge dominant mean tissue acquisition pancreatic mass lesion . FNA several limitation , foremost absence clear relationship cellular element stroma may require accurate diagnosis . Additionally , EUS-FNA require assistance on-site cytopathologist optimal yield limit dissemination increase cost . A novel EUS histology needle ( EUS-FNB ) available 22 gauge diameter may allow accurate diagnosis without need site cytopathology assistance . Aim : To prospectively compare diagnostic yield , number needle pass , ease use 22 gauge EUS-FNA EUS-FNB . Hypothesis : EUS-FNB superior traditional EUS-FNA regard primary secondary outcome measure . Methods : Patients schedule EUS evaluation solid pancreatic tumor screen enrollment either precede clinical encounter morning schedule procedure . English-speaking patient age 18 90 predominantly solid ( great 60 % ) mass lesion pancreas consider enrollment . Exclusion criterion include pregnancy , predominantly cystic lesion , presence uncorrectable coagulopathy . Patients undergo EUS-FNA EUS-FNB collection tissue specimen require clinical care . The result experimental approach ( EUS-FNB ) compare control approach ( EUS-FNA ) . Data collect procedure include : instrument use order , number needle pass device , technical success device , complication , ease use , ultimate pathological diagnosis / diagnostic yield device . Each data category compare utilizing standard statistical test include chi-squared , Fishers ' exact , student 's test .</detailed_description>

Absence uncorrectable coagulopathy define abnormal prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) correct administration fresh frozen plasma . The patient must read speak english sign informed consent document . The patient schedule diagnostic endosonography refer provider UVa gastroenterologist . Age le 18 great 90 year . The patient unable read understand consent form . The patient currently pregnant . The patient uncorrectable coagulopathy define prolonged prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) improve administration fresh frozen plasma . The patient pancreatic mass lesion predominantly cystic ( great 40 % ) . No mass lesion identify time endosonography .</criteria>
