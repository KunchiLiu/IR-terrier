	<brief_summary>Cryolipolysis Zeltiq CoolSculpting device novel method non-invasive fat removal . The technique work application cold plat skin surface single cool cycle last 60 minute , cold-induced inflammatory panniculitis lead selective loss fat . There histologic evidence necrotic inflammatory damage skin nerve , however single small human study report prolonged temporary alter sensation ( hypoesthesia ) area cryolipolysis procedure . This hypoesthesia see 2/3 patient , completely reversible , last 8 week treatment , suggest cool condition temporarily alter sensory nerve function . The purpose study characterize reversible cutaneous sensory function alteration cryolipolysis Zeltiq CoolSculpting device . Using multiple modality sensory nerve function hope elucidate detail cryolipolysis induce sensory nerve alteration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design We undertake open-label , prospective study Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) ( Boston , USA ) December 2012 July 2013 . The study approve MGH Institutional Research Board register ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01673113 ) . Written , informed consent obtain participant prior participation study . The study conform standard set Declaration Helsinki Good Clinical Practice Guidelines . Eleven healthy subject enrol study . They randomize either leave right flank treat single cycle cryolipolysis . Baseline measurement sensory function evaluate use QST treat control ( untreated ) flank subject . Histamine iontophoresis use evaluate itch duration intensity treat control flank subject . All sensory function testing , include response histamine-induced itch , assess 48-72 hour , Day 7 , 14 , 21 , 35 56 post-treatment . In 6 subject , skin biopsy ( 3 mm diameter ) histological analysis nerve fiber density treat flank take baseline , 48-72 hour , Day 21 56 post-treatment . Cryolipolysis procedure All subject receive cryolipolysis treatment flank iliac crest , one side body . The untreated ( contralateral ) flank serve control throughout study . Subjects randomize right leave flank treated randomization achieve computer-generated randomization code . The treatment site identify , assess mark single , unblinded investigator . The sensory testing site within flank mark registered use transparent plastic sheet , align use cutaneous landmark include nevi scar , photograph subject standard position , ensure area test follow-up visit . Cryolipolysis perform use EzApp6.3 applicator ( CoolScultping , Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc , Pleasanton USA ) standard setting cool intensity factor ( CIF ) 41.6 , correspond heat transfer -73mW/cm2 , apply one hour . Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) The QST protocol consist series 7 sensory test . The QST procedure start evaluation mechanical follow thermal threshold .</detailed_description>
