	<brief_title>Physical Activity Telehealth Intervention After Percutaneous Coronary Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular physical activity important maintenance cardiovascular health , especially critical previously sedentary individual undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) procedure . Changing behavior adopt maintain recommended physical activity level population difficult . Interventions accomplish behavior change work unless adopt person 's busy lifestyle . This propose study fill gap test feasibility innovative , target intervention ( Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention ) , deliver practical feasible platform ( cell phone ) . The asynchronous targeted daily interaction consist 5-6 text , picture , and/or video message deliver subject 's cell phone day . Upon successful completion study , believe feasibility finding provide foundation test large clinical trial promote physical activity population .</detailed_description>
