	<brief_summary>Postoperative seroma formation one common complication ventral hernia repair . Although seromas may clinical impact , postoperative seroma formation often cause pain discomfort may even compromise wound healing . The use postoperative abdominal binder often recommend ventral hernia repair prevent seroma diminish pain , still scientific evidence . The primary aim present study investigate effect postoperative abdominal binder laparoscopic ventral hernia repair postoperative pain , discomfort quality life . Secondary , register seroma formation . Method material Randomized , control , multi-center , investigator-blinded study . A minimum 56 patient ( 2X28 umbi/epi ) include , inclusion number base power calculation . Patients randomize either abdominal binder abdominal binder . The abdominal binder worn immediately operation continuously 7 day , night day . Outcomes base patient self-reported registration use Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) Carolina Comfort Scale ( CCS ) , validate , hernia-specific tool estimate quality life , pain discomfort . Patients followed-up 30 day . For secondary outcome use ultrasound measure volume seroma formation . We use Mann-Witney , non-parametric statistic calculate seroma formation Friedmanns test pain , discomfort quality life effect time inter- intragroup difference study period .
