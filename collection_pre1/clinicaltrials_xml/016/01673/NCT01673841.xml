	<brief_summary>In clinical study investigator compare mixed venous oxygen saturation ( SmvO2 ) relative absolute cerebral oxygen saturation ( rScO2 ) measurement . They hypothesize previously report contradictory result regard equivalence SmvO2 rScO2 might relate time delay issue measurement technology . 42 consent patient undergo elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting include . 4 disposable oxygenation sensor apply bilaterally patient 's forehead continuous , non-invasive registration rScO2 . The sensor one monitor place eyebrow , sensor monitor place former sensor . The sensor placement determine random computerized randomization list . SmvO2 measure continuously via pulmonary artery catheter . All variable record continuously . The study end end operation .</brief_summary>
