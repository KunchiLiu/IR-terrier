	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate Renal Sympathetic Denervation ( RDN ) improve control blood pressure ( BP ) patient treatment-resistant hypertension , compare intensive medical therapy ( IMT ) use hemodynamic parameter apply predefined algorithm drug selection ( i.e . integrate hemodynamic management - IHM ) 6 month intensive treatment program ( receive antihypertensive care accord 2007 ESH Guidelines ) . Working hypothesis : When possible disrupt sympatho-renal axis RDN - BP reduction occur great extent rapidly apply intensive medical therapy use IHM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension common cardiovascular disease , affect approximately 1 billion1 people worldwide . Hypertension major public health concern , complication ( coronary artery disease , heart failure , renal disease , stroke ) . Early blood pressure control hypertensive patient guarantee best prevention cardiovascular event long term ( 2007 ESH-ESC Guidelines Management Hypertension ; VALUE study ) . However , spite education effort antihypertensive drug , blood pressure control rate remain low . The common cause uncontrolled BP inadequate pharmacological treatment , selection antihypertensive agent often do independently hemodynamic status patient ( volemic status , peripheral resistance , cardiac inotropy ) . The sympatho-renal axis describe dual role kidney originator central nervous system afferent signal recipient efferent sympathetic signal . Both contribution kidney central sympathetic drive consequence sympathetic efferent drive kidney contribute development sustenance hypertension . Poly-pharmacy strategy treatment elevate blood pressure identify population patient treatment resistant hypertension . Treatment Resistant Hypertension ( TRH ) blood pressure remain goal spite concomitant use antihypertensive medication 3 drug class . Patients require 4 drug class blood pressure control also consider resistant hypertension . Preferably , regimen include diuretic dos optimal2 .The true prevalence treatment resistant hypertension unknown . In clinical trial 20 40 % randomized patient reach blood pressure targets3 . In National Health Nutrition Examination Survey USA ( 2003-2008 ) , non-pregnant adult hypertension classify resistant blood pressure 140/90 mmHg high report use antihypertensive medication 3 different drug class drug 4 antihypertensive drug class regardless blood pressure . The prevalence 12.8 % drug-treated hypertensive population . Risk factor treatment-resistant hypertension include old age obesity . Treatment-resistant patient likely albuminuria , reduce renal function , history diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , stroke heart failure . They increase risk cardiovascular complication although true incidence death morbidity remain currently unknown . In Spanish Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Registry5 , 8295 68045 treated patient ( 12.2 % ) treatment resistant hypertension , define office blood pressure equal exceed 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic . RDN novel procedure approve safe give remarkable reduction BP treatment-resistant hypertensive patient . The HOTMAN® System novel impedance cardiographic device , measure calculate hemodynamic parameter . The HOTMAN® System may help physician control blood pressure patient resistance hypertension . * Our pilot study ( Renal sympathetic denervation patient treatment-resistant hypertension witness intake medication qualify ambulatory blood pressure.Fadl Elmula FE , Hoffmann P , Fossum E , Brekke M , Gjønnæss E , Hjørnholm U , Kjær VN , Rostrup M , Kjeldsen SE , Os I , Stenehjem AE , Høieggen A.Hypertension . 2013 Sep ; 62 ( 3 ) :526-32 ) show The mean office ambulatory BPs remain unchanged 1 , 3 , 6 month 6 patient , whereas know change antihypertensive medication . Two patient , however , fall office ambulatory BPs . Our finding question whether BP fall response RDN patient true treatment-resistant hypertension.That intend intrim analysis inclusion around 30 % total number plan include study .</detailed_description>
