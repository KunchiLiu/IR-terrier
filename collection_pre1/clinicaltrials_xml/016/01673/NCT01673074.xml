	<brief_title>HPPH PDT Pleural Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) experimental treatment use drug call photosensitizer photosensitize agent light kill cell . When photosensitizers expose specific wavelength light , produce form oxygen kill hearby cell . The appeal PDT oncology photosensitizer retain tumor tissue long period time compare normal tissue . This report differential photosensitizer retention tumor compare normal tissue provide potential enhance therapeutic index minimize normal tissue toxicity prompt interest study PDT cancer treatment propose treatment variety malignancy pre-malignant condition . The propose study Phase I trial photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treatment patient pleural malignancy . To participate patient must 18 year age old , must histological diagnosis pleural malignancy , must disease limited hemithorax ( one side chest ) , must medically suitable resection , must ECOG performance status 0-2 . Patients receive prior surgery , gene therapy , combination chemotherapy also permit least 30 day since last treatment . Patients give HPPH , intravenous injection prior surgery . HPPH chlorine base photosensitizer use along PDT prevent recurrence tumor follow surgical removal . After successful tumor removal light tunable dye laser diode laser administer . The start dose PDT administer 24 48 hour prior surgical resection . Red light use illuminate entire thoracic cavity . If adequate removal tumor perform , patient eligible receive light therapy . In parallel laboratory study , biopsy tumor normal tissue take resection specimen . Uptake HPPH measure tumor normal tissue tumor normal tissue ratio HPPH determine . Assessment molecular signal include EGFR , Akt , MAPK make tumor prior light delivery . Patients simultaneously enrol companion protocol 2-nitroimidazole , EF5 administer determine tumor oxygen concentration . Finally , non-invasive measurement optical property , tissue oxygenation , photosensitizer uptake , blood flow make intraoperatively . After hospital discharge patient see routinely outpatient Thoracic Surgery Radiation Oncology Department clinic . These follow visit occur one month. , two month later every three month first 24 month assess treatment related toxicity . A history physical examination , laboratory CT MRI chest perform every 3 month . A follow-up chest x-ray obtain clinically indicate . An assessment toxicity make follow-up visit . After 24 month , follow-up schedule clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
