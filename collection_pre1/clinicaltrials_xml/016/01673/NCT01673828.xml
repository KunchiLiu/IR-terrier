	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , dose-finding , two-stage adaptive , clinical trial study compare allopregnanolone placebo administer intravenously 5 day begin within 8 hour injury . Test product administer low high dose allopregnanolone ( Products L H , respectively ) placebo ( Product P ) intravenous solution . The product administer 4-day treatment period follow 1-day dose de-escalation period . Stage 1 study ass safety confirm dose Products L H achieve target steady-state plasma concentration set product . Dosing adjusted Stage 1 , necessary . Stage 2 initially allocate subject equally Products L , H P use adaptive randomization allocate subject Products L H optimized probability yield good 3-month Glasgow Outcome Score Extended ( GOS-E ) score .</detailed_description>
