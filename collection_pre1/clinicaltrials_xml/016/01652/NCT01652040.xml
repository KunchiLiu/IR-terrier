	<brief_summary>The goal proposal investigate efficacy complimentary approach evoke resistance train testosterone replacement therapy change body composition metabolic profile SCI . The propose method could become recommended simple intervention especially individual limit access poor tolerance exercise . The rationale base evidence individual SCI experience decline anabolic hormone may responsible deterioration body composition metabolic profile lead increase obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia subsequently cardiovascular disease . The design study provide explanation adaptation energy source muscle cell response training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals spinal cord injury ( SCI ) lifelong risk increase obesity several chronic metabolic disorder glucose intolerance , insulin resistance dyslipidemia secondary deterioration body composition . Within week injury , significant decrease whole body fat-free mass ( FFM ) , particularly low extremity skeletal muscle mass subsequent increase fat mass ( FM ) . Resistance training ( RT ) important type exercise show induce positive physiological adaptation increase lean mass reduce metabolic disorder clinical population . In pilot work , investigator provide evidence evoke RT use surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) knee extensor muscle group result significant increase skeletal muscle cross-sectional area ( CSA ) , reduction % leg FM trend towards decrease visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) CSA . The favorable adaptation body composition associate decrease plasma insulin area curve plasma triglyceride . The investigator attribute adaptation body composition metabolic profile associate increase plasma insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) . The investigator conclude twelve week evoke RT target towards evoke skeletal muscle hypertrophy could result significant body composition metabolic adaptation individual SCI . It unclear longer RT program great 12 week would provide additional benefit Veterans SCI . It also unknown whether enhance decline anabolic homeostasis provide testosterone ( T ) replacement therapy ( TRT ) would reverse body composition metabolic profile change Veterans SCI . The major research goal proposal investigate effect 16 week evoke RT+TRT vs. TRT body composition ( muscle CSA , VAT , % FM ) metabolic profile ( glucose lipid metabolism ) individual motor complete SCI . To address goal , surface NMES accompany ankle weight conduct twice weekly exercise knee extensor skeletal muscle group sit position . After 4 week delay entry approach , participant ( n =24 ) randomly assign RT+TRT ( n =12 ) TRT ( n =12 ) group . The TRT provide via transdermal T patch alternate shoulder course study . The investigator also propose study effect detrain body composition metabolic profile . The research plan include three specific aim Specific aim 1 demonstrate effect NMES RT and/or Testosterone patch ( Tp ) CSA thighs legs skeletal muscle group , percentage FFM , CSA VAT , intramuscular fat percentage FM 16 week training+Tp 16 week detrain . Specific aim 2 determine change metabolic milieu ( rest energy expenditure , glucose homeostasis , lipid profile , free fatty acid , serum total free testosterone IGF-1 ) , cytokine ( c-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor alpha IL-6 inflammatory biomarkers ) 16 week training+Tp detraining . Specific aim 3 determine 16 week evoke RT Tp increase GLUT-4 concentration , muscle IGF-1 peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 ( PGC-1 ) expression , alter fiber type distribution enhance mitochondrial enzymatic activity ( electron transport chain ) compare Tp .</detailed_description>
