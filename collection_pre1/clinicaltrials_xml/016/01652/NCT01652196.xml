	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give aflibercept together combination chemotherapy work treat patient previously untreated colon rectal cancer metastatic locally advanced remove surgery . Aflibercept may stop growth colon rectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving aflibercept together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) patient untreated metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) receive combination modify leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX6 ) ( mFOLFOX6 ) aflibercept . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) disease control rate ( CR + PR + stable disease [ SD ] ) , determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion , patient untreated mCRC receive combination mFOLFOX6 aflibercept . II . To evaluate overall survival patient untreated mCRC receive combination mFOLFOX6 aflibercept . III . To characterize safety toxicity combination mFOLFOX6 aflibercept , include 60 day all-cause mortality . IV . To describe patient mCRC whose disease render resectable consequence therapy combination mFOLFOX 6 aflibercept . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess use dynamic imaging modality include dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) evaluate change vascular permeability FDG avidity correlate clinical efficacy ( PFS , overall survival [ OS ] , response RECIST 1.1 ) . II . To evaluate circulating level vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA ) , phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis , class F ( PlGF ) , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGF-R2 ) , chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) potential biomarkers efficacy aflibercept . III . To evaluate presence VEGF single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) whether SNP ( ) , detect , may predictive efficacy and/or toxicity aflibercept . IV . To assess microvessel density/tumor blood flow , capillary permeability vessel normalization tumor biopsy pre post treatment aflibercept . V. To evaluate presence hypertension predictive biomarker clinical efficacy aflibercept . OUTLINE : Patients receive aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour follow oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 5-15 minute continuously 46 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
