	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine study drug , dasatinib , give combination 5-Fluorouracil , leucovorin oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) work metastatic pancreatic cancer . Dasatinib Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug treat chronic myelogenous leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia , however currently approve use treatment pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study 5-FU , Oxaliplatin Plus Dasatinib Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic control pancreatic cancer remain clinical unmet need . The recent superiority 5-FU base combination therapy historical standard gemcitabine represent opportunity develop novel combination synergistic effective cytotoxic biologic target therapy . Src excess activity demonstrate pancreatic cancer implicate invasive metastatic phenotype clearly represent disease . Inhibition Src activity associate numerous biologic modification capable positively modify phenotype appear synergy restore inherent chemosensitivity . The addition dasatinib FOLFOX ( FOLFOX-D ) represent novel therapeutic regimen pancreatic cancer safety pharmacokinetic data already establish colorectal cancer . This protocol test safety activity combination pancreatic cancer current clinical outcome remain far optimal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma evidence metastatic disease image Measurable disease ( per RECIST 1.1 ) ECOG Performance Status 02 No prior chemotherapy radiotherapy metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients may receive prior treatment nonmetastatic disease ; however diagnosis metastatic disease must make 6 month completion treatment . Patients may history malignancy current evidence persistent recurrent disease undergo active therapy ( include hormonal ) Patent biliary system Patients receive anticoagulation treatment agent Coumadin heparin may allow participate , provide stable anticoagulation therapy active bleeding condition carry high risk bleed Adequate organ marrow function Ability take oral medication ( dasatinib must swallow whole ) Patient agree discontinue prohibit concomitant medication Age &gt; 18 year Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception throughout study least 4 week last dose study drug . A male subject father potential must use adequate method contraception throughout study least 4 week last dose study drug . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 4 week last dose study drug . Women pregnant breastfeed sexually active fertile men use effective birth control partner WOCBP also exclude . History known brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis Recent major surgery ( within 4 week ) minor surgery ( within 2 week ) , exclude placement vascular access device biliary stent Uncontrolled diabetes Any sensory neuropathy &gt; grade 1 baseline Serious active uncontrolled infection Concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity include clinically significant pleural pericardial effusion , patient know DPD deficiency patient history allergic reaction attribute oxaliplatin , 5FU leucovorin . Cardiac Symptoms include unstable angina stable angina markedly limit ordinary physical activity , NYHA class III IV congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction stroke within 6 month study enrollment , diagnose congenital long QT syndrome , history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia , prolong QTc interval preentry ECG clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . Subjects hypokalemia hypomagnesemia correct prior dasatinib administration History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include diagnose congenital bleeding disorder , diagnose acquire bleed disorder within one year ongoing recent ( â‰¤ 3 month ) significant gastrointestinal bleeding . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use protocol therapy , might affect interpretation result study , put subject high risk treatment complication . Use category I drug generally accept risk cause Torsades de Pointes Use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor significantly increase dasatinib exposure Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious disease ) illness Inability comply study and/or followup procedure</criteria>
