	<brief_summary>Researchers University South Florida 's Rehabilitation Engineering program look volunteer participate research study experimental evaluation wheelchair-mounted robotic arm ( WMRAs ) . Participants operate commercially available developmental WMRAs physical test environment . The study serve identify desirable design feature WMRAs input device future production system may increase quality life potential user . The study also promote justification prescribe WMRAs enhance quality life propose standard test method , awareness emerge assistive robotics industry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals injury condition result upper low body disability power wheelchair-bound key interest . The purpose study experimentally evaluate six wheelchair mount robotic arm ( WMRAs ) . The goal quantitatively compare device . In order compare device , patient ask operate one six wheelchair mount robotic arm time . With WMRA , patient ask perform series four activity daily live . patient present survey conclusion task test . The survey design quantitatively rank WMRA 's performance . The time complete task arm also record . Patients ask question age , occupation , disability and/or physical limitation , wheelchair use . Patients ask disclose pertinent medical information determine level mobility . Then patient research team know whether study . If take part study , patient ask use series device control six WMRAs complete follow task : - Open cabinet vary height - Open drawer vary height - Operate mock sink fixtures - Operate mock light switch - Plug mock electrical outlet - Open personnel door - Move object table top - Move object book shelf - Move cup table top participant 's mouth - Perform previous task additional cognitive load * Additional cognitive load may include limited carry conversation attempt perform give task Patients ask spend four hour study , complete one session Rehabilitation Robotics Prosthetics Testbed University South Florida . Break refreshment time available setup installation time six WMRAs . It anticipate twenty people take part study USF . Participants take part study may find quality life benefit result become familiar WMRA assistive device . Participants may find use WMRA helpful performing activity daily live , though participant give WMRAs personal use . The research study direct compare contrast commercially available developmental WMRAs . The study also help increase awareness WMRAs possibly help develop assistive manipulator industry United States .</detailed_description>
