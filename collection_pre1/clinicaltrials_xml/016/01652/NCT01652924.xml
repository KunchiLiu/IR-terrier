	<brief_title>Efficacy Mechanical Ventilation With Facial Mask Reduce Gastric Insufflation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Manual ventilation widely use induction anesthesia unsupported theoretical advantage clinical trial test airway patency adequate ventilation lung expansion . Additionally , develop country recently lack sufficient ventilation supply controlled fan different mode could use induction anesthesia . However , case report pediatric adult patient intubate , note manual ventilation could relate increased frequency gastric insufflation predispose regurgitation aspiration , impaired ventilation , respiratory failure , reduce cardiac output rupture visceral ischemia . To date , control clinical trial corroborate experience . Gastric insufflation may appear result manual ventilation mechanical . In connection first allow volume control current , time insufflation inspiratory pressure , determine maximum peak inspiratory pressure , directly proportional incidence complication . Meanwhile , mechanical ventilation associate gastric insufflation pressure exceed certain limit peak airway . vonGoedecke et al , clinical trial mechanical ventilation ( pressure control ) manual healthy adult induction anesthesia whose outcome ventilatory variable , find mechanical ventilation associate low peak inspiratory pressure low airway peak inspiratory flow rate tidal volume minute low . They recommend mechanical ventilation induction anesthesia safe technique . To make ventilation safer unprotected airway , consider two strategy : limit tidal volume peak inspiratory pressure limit . Seet colleague compare healthy adult two mechanical ventilation strategy addition manual technique induction consider composite endpoint ventilatory variable gastric insufflation clinical trial . They find pressure-controlled ventilation associate low peak inspiratory pressure gastric insufflation less two method , suggest technique safer method choice ventilation apnea patient induction . Several study show clinical significance gastric insufflation induction anesthesia 2009 , Paal colleague present result two study animal : one cardiac arrest another spontaneous circulation , first abdominal compartment syndrome lead hemodynamic compromise , respiratory , metabolic , finally multi-organ , animal spontaneous circulation , effect even bad reduction survival gastric insufflation consider cause heart failure . The author conclude gastric insufflation alone cause heart failure multiple organ failure occur much faster critical patient . , In addition substantial mechanical cardiopulmonary effect , insufflation stomach complex problem cause regurgitation , aspiration , pneumonia death . Increases abdominal pressure , elevate diaphragm , restricts lung movement thus reduce compliance respiratory system . A reduction respiratory system compliance may direct ventilation volume stomach airway protect , thus induce vicious circle breath , increase insufflation stomach decrease lung ventilation . Added fact anesthetic drug reduce low esophageal sphincter pressure 90 % case child suction produce induction anesthesia , needless emphasize importance control adverse effect . Control gastric insufflation would particularly useful patient comorbidities predispose regurgitation cardiac arrest patient . Children great risk gastric insufflation induction anesthesia anatomical physiological characteristic inherent conduct respiratory system promote airway obstruction passage air stomach : proportional size head tongue , short neck , small chin , among others . This compounded use ventilation without control parameter tidal volume , inspiratory time peak inspiratory pressure , well reduction low esophageal sphincter pressure cause anesthetic airway device . It likely increase risk gastric insufflation explanation increase incidence aspiration respiratory complication find study , particularly anesthetic induction . The work von GoedeckeSeet pioneer new form induction anesthesia ventilation patient safer comfortable anesthesiologist , use develop fan bring new anesthesia machine allow get ventilatory mode build . However , lack adequate methodological design job validate technique different population , one pediatric population , characteristic mention would suggest one favored method . Therefore , paper seek establish whether pressure-controlled ventilation induction anesthesia reduces incidence gastric insufflation compare manual ventilation child age 1 month 14 year .</detailed_description>
