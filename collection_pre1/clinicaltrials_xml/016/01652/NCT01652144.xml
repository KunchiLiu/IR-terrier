	<criteria>Histologically document mantle cell lymphoma nonrefractory prior therapy . Diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma confirm local institution 's lymphoma pathologist . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . At least one site disease must bidimensionally measurable use CT MRI perform 3 week prior study enrolment . Bone lesion consider bidimensionally measurable . Minimum size least ONE lesion must follow : ( must do within 21 day prior registration ) Lymph node ( measure spiral CT scan ) &gt; 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm Other nonnodal lesion : MRI ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm CT scan ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm Physical exam ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm ( e.g . skin lesion , nodule ) Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 ( see Appendix II ) . Previous Therapy Patients must receive least one , three prior systemic chemotherapy regimen ( high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support permit must count one line therapy ) must NOT show disease progression receive chemotherapy within 1 month last dose recent therapy ( i.e . must nonrefractory ) . Systemic Therapy : Patients must ≥ 4 week since last dose systemic therapy ( include investigational ) . As noted , 13 previous chemotherapy regimen may give . NB : The chemotherapy combination give first line therapy second line therapy consider two regimen . Exceptions 4week interval since last treatment possible prior therapy nonmyelosuppressive treatmentrelated myelosuppression resolve . Not permit : Radioactive Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Prior treatment AT7519M another CDK inhibitor Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant ( Note : autologous stem cell transplant permit ) Prior rituximab bortezomib treatment permit , must count systemic therapy regimen give single agent . Radiation : Patients may radiation , provide minimum 21 day elapse prior enrollment . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior registration . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur least 14 day elapse surgery major . Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology Absolute neutrophil ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L Chemistry Serum creatinine ≤ UNL Bilirubin ≤ UNL AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x UNL Potassium , calcium , magnesium Within normal limit Creatine Kinase ( CK CPK ) ≤ UNL Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . The patient must sign consent form prior registration . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . Patients know CNS involvement lymphoma . Tests investigate CNS involvement require clinically indicate ( i.e . disease suspect basis symptom finding ) . Patients know hypersensitivity study drug component . The following exclusion enrolment study : 1 . Pregnant lactating woman . ( N.B . : All woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration ) . 2 . Men woman childbearing potential agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . ( Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant , man father child , participate study , she/he inform treat physician immediately . ) Serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol , include , limited : 1. history significant neurologic psychiatric disorder ( e.g . uncontrolled psychotic disorder ) would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement ; 2. active uncontrolled serious infection ; 3. pulmonary disease require oxygen ; 4. know HIV infection immune deficiency ; 5. medical condition might aggravate study treatment Patients preexist cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction follow : 1 . Significant cardiac event ( include symptomatic heart failure angina ) within 3 month entry cardiac disease , opinion investigator , increase risk ventricular arrhythmia . 2 . Any personal history ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic require treatment ( CTC grade 3 ) . This include : multifocal PVCs , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia ) 3 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg high diastolic blood pressure 95 mmHg high ) 4 . A previous history drug induce significant QTc prolongation ( define QTc interval equal great 500msec ) cause significant ECG abnormalities 5 . Congenital long QT syndrome 6 . QT QTc , unmeasurable &gt; 460 msec screen ECG 7 . Left ventricular ejection fraction less institution 's low limit normal ( LLN ) measure MUGA echocardiogram Patients currently receive treatment agent know risk Torsades de Pointes . ( see http : //torsades.org ( list # 1 ) ) . However , patient may enrol study treatment agent stop ≥ 7 day prior first dose AT7519M . Patients preexist peripheral neuropathy ( sensory and/or pain ) &gt; grade 2 .</criteria>
