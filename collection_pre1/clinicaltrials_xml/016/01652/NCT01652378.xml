	<detailed_description>An extensive effort mount understand neurobiologic mechanism involve development persistence cocaine addiction tendency relapse . Although last two decade result explosion understand biological mechanism reward , establish relevance knowledge addictive process problematic . Most importantly , information limit utility offer new pharmacologic treatment approach addict patient - particularly cocaine addiction . Over past 15 year laboratory publish multiple study use pharmacologic probe explore biologic underpinnings cocaine addiction use single photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) technology . More recently , however , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) offer several advantage SPECT favor approach , e.g . fMRI allow continuous measurement neural response rather limited time period SPECT ( 1-3 minute every 48 hour ) . Using fMRI [ include ASL ( Arterial Spin Labeling ) fcMRI ( functional connectivity ] , neural response measure throughout 60 min follow infusion , allow identification capture maximal brain response period may occur time 60 min . In proposed study , assess brain response two probe ( scopolamine lidocaine ) previously study SPECT .</detailed_description>
