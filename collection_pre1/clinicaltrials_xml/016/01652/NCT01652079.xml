	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . In addition study safety , Phase II clinical trial test investigational drug effective whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve CRLX101 type cancer . Camptothecin chemical extract plant basis standard FDA-approved chemotherapy drug irinotecan topotecan . Camptothecin work interfere way cell divide multiply . The investigational drug CRLX101 formulation camptothecin large molecule ( nanoparticle ) appear allow camptothecin get tumor stay tumor . The persistence CRLX101 tumor may increase probability tumor cell damage . CRLX101 well tolerate laboratory participant different kind cancer . Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) VEGF inhibitor activity many kind cancer . Bevacizumab successfully combine many chemotherapy partner . It hypothesize combination bevacizumab CRLX101 might unique clinical activity combination treatment disease due simultaneous inhibition distinct step along HIF → ( CAIX ) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway . Specifically , hypothesize CRLX101-mediated inhibition HIF-1α carry potential interrupt hypoxia HIF-1α-associated resistance VEGFR inhibitor . It hop combination work treat type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You receive CRLX101 bevacizumab intravenous ( IV ) infusion every 14 day . Each cycle 28 day . You continue receive drug and/or research doctor decide may best interest continue . You receive premedication include decadron , zantac benadryl help prevent allergic reaction nausea prior CRLX101 infusion.You also receive IV fluid study drug administration keep hydrate . It important drink water regularly study visits.You treat outpatient . At every clinic visit , undergo follow assessment : Medical history , physical examination , vital sign , performance status , routine blood test , urine test , assessment new side effect , CT evaluation ( every 8 week ) . You end study visit within 30 day last dose .</detailed_description>
