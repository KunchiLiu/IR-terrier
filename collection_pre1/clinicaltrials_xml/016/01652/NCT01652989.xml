	<brief_summary>The PILI @ Work project 5 year randomize control trial adapt weight loss program employee Native Hawaiian-serving organization Hawai ' . The study two specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To adapt implement weight loss weight loss maintenance program Native Hawaiian-serving organization , work employee representative determine intervention best implement employee worksites . Specific Aim 2 : Among employee participate program , test whether weight loss maintenance program DVD format effective weight loss maintenance program group face face format maintain weight loss employee complete weight loss program . The investigator hypothesize PILI @ Work intervention effectively adapt implemented worksite setting active participation employee employer . The investigator also hypothesize overweight ( BMI ≥ 25 ) obese ( BMI ≥ 30 ) employee complete weight loss portion intervention , randomize receive weight loss maintenance intervention via DVD similar success maintain weight loss compare randomize PILI Maintenance group meeting setting . The investigator hypothesize also true physical functioning , blood pressure , daily self-weighing , low moderate fat low calorie diet , daily physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Effective culturally relevant intervention need curb rise tide overweight obesity . This study adapt evidence-based weight loss intervention use Native Hawaiian-serving organization Hawai ' , use community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach . Findings two previous NIH-funded project help inform propose research : 1 ) The Designing Healthy Worksites ( DHW ) Project 2 ) PILI Lifestyle Intervention ( PILI ) , develop PILI 'Ohana ( family ) Project : Partnerships Overcome Obesity Disparities Hawai ' . The DHW Project engage eight Native Hawaiian-serving organization obtain data 1 ) exist worksite policy support and/or promote health well-being employee 2 ) perspective ideas employee employer around create healthy workplace . DHW participant express enthusiasm health promotion program worksite , especially weight-loss program . The PILI 'Ohana Project adapt evidence-based lifestyle intervention use Native Hawaiians Pacific Islanders seek care community health clinic and/or member civic group . The PILI Lifestyle Intervention ( PILI ) two phases—PILI Weight Loss PILI Maintenance . Both PILI Wt Loss PILI Maintenance design deliver community-based group . In pilot testing , participant participate PILI Wt Loss realize significant weight loss 3 month . Participants randomize PILI Maintenance standard behavioral treatment ( SBT ) ; PILI Maintenance perform good SBT . PILI Wt Loss PILI Maintenance improve base feedback pilot . Because report time constraint pilot participant , DVD version PILI Maintenance develop people could use instead attend group session . In subsequent community-based study PILI ( fund NIH-NCMHD underway ) , non-worksite participant randomize face-to-face DVD delivery PILI Maintenance completion PILI Wt Loss . Our specific aim hypothesis application worksites follow : Specific Aim 1 : To adapt implement PILI Wt Loss PILI Maintenance Native Hawaiian-serving organization , work employee representative determine intervention best implement employee worksites ( PILI Wt Loss PILI Maintenance together call PILI @ Work ) . Primary hypothesis : A community-tested , evidence-based intervention obesity reduction weight-loss maintenance effectively adapt implemented worksite setting active participation employee employer . Specific Aim 2 : Among employee participate PILI @ Work , test whether PILI Maintenance DVD format effective PILI Maintenance Group maintain weight loss employee complete PILI Wt Loss . Primary hypothesis : Overweight ( BMI ≥ 25 ) obese ( BMI ≥ 30 ) employee complete PILI Wt Loss successful weight loss outcome , randomize PILI Maintenance DVD similar success maintain weight loss compare randomize PILI Maintenance group meeting setting . Successful weight loss maintenance measure ≥ 3 % mean weight change . Secondary hypothesis : Employees participate PILI Maintenance DVD PILI Maintenance Group show similar maintenance , improvement , physical functioning , blood pressure , daily self-weighing , low moderate fat low calorie diet , daily physical activity .</detailed_description>
