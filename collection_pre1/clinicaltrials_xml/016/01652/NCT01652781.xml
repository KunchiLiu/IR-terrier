	<brief_summary>Approved dose schedule azacitidine myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) 75 mg/m^2/day subcutaneous 7 consecutive day every 28 day , base data standard chemotherapy regimen Phase I safety clinical trial . Since optimal dosage drug find yet , remain subject clinical study need examine . If initial toxicity minimize develop dosage/regimen replaces standard therapy , possible provide continuous treatment increase convenience patient treat physician well improvement safety elderly patient serious cytopenia . In addition , expect lead well response strictly keep treatment schedule . Recent US study show 5-day regimen show similar treatment result , retrospective data Spain show low response rate 5-day regimen . Considering recent circumstance around dosage schedule azacitidine low risk MDS , Phase II clinical trial plan low risk MDS patient order explore efficacy 5-day treatment compare prospectively 7-day standard regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5 Day Versus 7 Day Azacitidine Lower Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Using block randomization , subject Low intermediate ( INT ) -1 patient equally allocate follow two type regimen . 1 . Group A : azacitidine 75mg/m^2 subcutaneously 7 day every 28 day + best supportive care 2 . Group B : azacitidine 75mg/m^2 subcutaneously 5 day every 28 day + best supportive care - The study drug , azacitidine , provide free charge Celgene disease progression relapse response , intolerable toxicity occur clinical study subject , informed consent withdrawn . - No crossover arm allow . - Dose escalation study allow ; contrary , dose reduction dose delay possible base adverse event hematologic recovery .</detailed_description>
