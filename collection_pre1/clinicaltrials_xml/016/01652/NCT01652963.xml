	<brief_title>Picture-based Computerised Assessment Training Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY 1 HYPOTHESES 1 . A picture-based training programme aim link situation emotion improves cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) skill link situation , beliefs emotion . 2 . People intellectual disability understand follow procedure computer base assessment training task . DESIGN A 2 x ( 2 x S ) mix experimental design use between-subjects factor ( Intervention : training group versus control group ) within-subjects factor ( Time : baseline assessment versus post-intervention assessment ) . Baseline post-intervention assessment CBT skills derive cognitive mediation task develop Dagnan et al . ( 2000 ) . Performance post-intervention assessment consider primary outcome variable study ( Hypothesis 1 ) . The intervention train group base Reed Clements task ( 1989 ) assess ability link situation emotion . The intervention control group consist presentation stimulus material intervention group . The material present without specific training instruction match time duration train group intervention . The control group intervention allow evaluation training task efficacy rather evaluate confound effect present certain stimulus material . Assessment training task conduct individually present via computer programme laptop computer external response box ( Hypothesis 2 ) . PROCEDURES Pre-study procedure . When consent obtain , principal investigator ass verbal ability ( BPVS-2 ) level intellectual functioning ( WASI-II ) . Participants meet inclusion criterion invite complete baseline assessment . Baseline assessment . At baseline , researcher introduce laptop computer external response box . The computer program introduce one sample item assessment solve computer illustrate task work . The sample item repeat participant solve researcher check participant understand procedure task . The sample item repeat participant understands procedure learn operate response box . The primary investigator present assist participant use response box explain task procedure . The adapted cognitive mediation task consist two block twelve exercise . Exercises randomise within block block counterbalance participant . Block 1 present six scenario pair positive negative thought result twelve task item . Each task item present two picture situation follow picture positive negative think situation . Participants prompt identify two pictured emotion ( happy sad ) would feel follow give situation thought . Block 2 present scenario pair positive negative emotional response create twelve task item . Each item present two picture situation follow picture emotional response ( happy sad ) . Participants prompt identify two thought ( positive negative ) likely cause give emotion present situation . Intervention train group . Participants give break baseline assessment intervention task . The primary investigator replace second researcher responsible conduct intervention task . The intervention train group base task develop Reed Clements ( 1989 ) . The training task consist two block six item present randomly within block block counterbalance participant . Block 1 follow original task present situation prompt participant identify whether would feel happy sad give situation . Block 2 present emotion ( happy sad ) prompt participant identify two situation ( positive negative ) likely precede emotion . Each block contain three positive ( positive situation happy emotion give ) three negative item ( negative situation sad emotion give ) . The training task begin sample exercise solve computer sample exercise participant , similarly procedure baseline assessment . Within block least one maximum three train round . In first training round six item within block present . The second third training round consist item participant respond incorrect previous round . Each item follow feedback incorrect response follow correct response . Intervention control group . The intervention control group consist presentation stimulus use training task . Participants see situation listen simultaneous voice recording . Unlike train task participant receive instruction link situation emotion . There task requirement , presentation situation stimuli assure potential training effect due train programme merely presentation scenario . The duration presentation stimulus material control group range fifteen thirty minute . The variable duration necessary primary investigator assume participant 's intervention group base duration intervention task . Post-intervention assessment . Post-intervention assessment take place fifteen minute intervention task . The second researcher leave room primary investigator return conduct post-intervention assessment . Participants remind disclose information concern intervention task researcher . The post-intervention assessment consist adapt cognitive mediation task baseline assessment . The procedure baseline assessment apply post-intervention assessment . Within block six exercise , four exercise randomly choose baseline item two new item add . STUDY 2 HYPOTHESES 1 . Photographs may advantage standard line drawing improve performance task assess ability link situation , beliefs emotion . It hypothesise photographic approach increase effectiveness CBT skills training . It assume high reality value photograph may enhance identification task material thereby improve performance . 2 . A photographic approach may , compare standard verbal approach line drawings-based approach , reduce impact verbal ability assessment CBT skill . 3 . A CBT training programme aim link situation emotion may improve emotion recognition skill cognitive mediation skill ( assessed ability link situation , beliefs emotion ) . DESIGN Study 2 base 2 x ( 2 x S ) mix experimental design between-subjects factor ( Training group : line drawing group versus photograph group ) within-subjects factor ( Time : baseline assessment versus post-intervention assessment ) . Baseline post-intervention assessment CBT skill consist adapted cognitive mediation task , use describe Study 1 , emotion recognition task . Both assessment line drawing photograph stimulus material investigate Hypotheses 1 3 . The intervention train group base Reed Clements task ( 1989 ) describe Study 1 . Participants line drawing group receive adapt Reed Clements task ( 1989 ) base line drawing . Participants photographs group present photographs task stimulus . The content task item differ train group , pictorial presentation item differs ( Hypothesis 1 2 ) . There separate control group . PROCEDURES Pre-study procedure . These procedure identical pre-study procedure describe Study 1 . Baseline assessment . The primary investigator begin remind participant participation voluntary , data anonymous right withdraw study time . The researcher introduce laptop computer external response box continue explain procedure task . Baseline assessment consist counterbalance presentation emotion recognition task adapt cognitive mediation task . The computer program introduce one sample item first assessment solve computer illustrate task work . The sample item repeat participant solve researcher check participant understand procedure task . The sample item repeat participant understands procedure learn operate response box . Baseline assessment consist counterbalance presentation emotion recognition task adapt cognitive mediation task . For task half item present line drawing half item photograph . The procedure adapt cognitive mediation task describe Study 1 . The emotion recognition task Study 2 consist two block six exercise , counterbalance participant . The exercise block 1 base line drawing exercise block 2 base photograph . All exercise , regardless block condition , begin three second presentation happy face sad face . A voice record play tell participant emotion picture . This presentation follow one second blank screen . Following blank screen , three new picture various emotion show . A recorded voice prompt participant identify three present emotion similar initially presented emotion . The target emotion happy sad , two distracter emotion may vary neutral , annoyed , disgusted , grumpy , surprised angry . Intervention . Participants give break baseline assessment train task . The primary investigator leave room replace second researcher responsible conduct training task . The training task adapt Reed Clements ( 1989 ) task base line drawing line drawing group photograph photographs group . The procedure follow procedure training task Study 1 . Post-intervention assessment . After train task participant give short break principal investigator return conduct post-intervention assessment . The researcher remind participant disclose information regard training task . Post-intervention assessment adapt cognitive mediation task emotion recognition task follow procedure baseline assessment . For post-intervention assessment half baseline item within task block replace new item control rehearsal effect test generalisation training effect new item .</detailed_description>
