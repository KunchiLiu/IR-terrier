	<brief_title>Pacemaker Upgrade Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction Dependant Upon Right Ventricular Pacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background 1 . Chronic heart failure Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) common syndrome breathlessness fatigue associate leave ventricular systolic dysfunction . It affect 2 % individual 50 60 year age , increase prevalence 10 % age 80 year . 2 . Cardiac resynchronisation therapy Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) involve implantation pacemaker capable stimulating heart ( specifically leave ventricle ) front heart , right ventricle RV ( usual conventional pacemaker ) back heart ( know lateral wall ) via coronary sinus , aim improve timing cardiac contraction ( dyssynchrony ) hence pump function heart order improve symptom breathlessness fatigue . Early data patient leave bundle branch block severe heart failure , suggest improved exercise capacity leave ventricular function . More recent data demonstrate improved symptom , also reduce hospital admission , improve overall mortality . Current guideline drawn use data randomise trial , suggest CRT offer patient leave bundle branch block QRS &gt; 150ms severe ( class III IV ) heart failure despite optimal medical therapy . Patients QRS duration 120 150ms assessed mechanical dyssynchrony offer device . 3 . Heart failure pacemaker population - Prevalence In 307 patient pacemaker , 94 ( 31 % ) leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % 83 ( 27 % ) symptoms heart failure . RV pace associated increase heart failure-related hospitalisation mortality , patient leave ventricular dysfunction presence right ventricular apical pacemaker strong predictor future deterioration leave ventricular function . - Aetiology pacemaker-related heart failure Many patient receive RV pacemaker elderly background ischaemic heart disease hypertension , contribute development heart failure . In addition RV pacing induces dyssynchrony , different leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) . Dyssynchrony lead alter regional blood flow wall stress . The severity perfusion abnormality , regional wall motion abnormality associate deterioration global leave ventricular function directly relate duration pace . These change identify 18 month pace . The induction dyssynchrony RV apical pacing seem therefore lead adverse LV remodeling , LV dilatation , asymmetrical hypertrophy . - Management pacemaker-related heart failure In one patient exact aetiology deterioration LV dysfunction often unclear . What become routine practice however , attempt avoid RV pace unless absolutely necessary several programme within commercially available device exist facilitate . The option patient high degree heart block hand remain limited aggressive medical therapy beta-blockers angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor . The effect upgrading conventional pacemaker system capable deliver resynchronisation therapy incompletely investigate . There retrospective series examine impact upgrading conventional pacemaker CRT system . Early data demonstrate safety adapt standard pacemaker provide biventricular stimulation suggest improvement LV function . One study , involve 20 patient chronic atrial fibrillation AV nodal ablation , show add LV lead associate improved LV systolic function , reduce hospitalisation improve quality life . Other report examine impact CRT patient chronic RV pace acute echocardiographic variable LV systolic function reduction electromechanical delay beneficial haemodynamic effect biventricular pace 15 20 patient pre-existing RV pacemaker . More recently cross-over study 44 patient require generator replacement demonstrate improved symptom LV function 3 month CRT compare 3 month RV pace . There also data small series demonstrate improvement echocardiographic strain variable ( 12 patient ) symptoms patient significant CHF upgrade conventional pacemaker CRT system 4 . Aim study We propose randomise 50 patient ventricular dysfunction list pulse generator replacement receive either standard right ventricular generator replacement , upgraded resynchronisation device . These patient reassess six month establish effect policy leave ventricular function exercise capacity . Experimental design 1 . Patients All patient undergone echocardiogram , exercise test renal function check part survey patient undergoing pacemaker battery change Leeds General Infirmary . If reduce avoid RV pace 80 % possible , patient LV dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 50 % ) invite participate randomise control trial standard generator replacement upgrade CRT . 2 . Procedures Patients randomise receive either upgraded system pacemaker generator replacement standard . Following implant , subject see 6 week three month pacemaker clinic usual . The 6 monthly visit include repeat echocardiography , exercise test metabolic gas exchange , repeat blood test , 24 hour urine collection symptom assessment . - Devices Patients either receive standard pacemaker appropriate pacing indication , capacity keep RV pace minimum possible , implanted LV lead generator capable provide resynchronisation pacing . - Risk implant procedure From large registry , leave ventricular lead implantation successful 92 % procedure safe few 8 % require re-operation around 10 % complication rate . In experience &gt; 100 upgrade severe symptomatic heart failure , death , one re-operation initial failure place LV lead , infection . - Patients atrial fibrillation The presence atrial fibrillation reduces benefit CRT randomise control trial . However , registry continue demonstrate similar overall benefit symptom leave ventricular function hospitalisation group , albeit improvement rate maintenance sinus rhythm follow CRT . Recent data suggest patient AV node ablation atrial fibrillation , similar symptomatic response rate patient sinus rhythm whereas without AV node ablation benefit . It therefore postulate benefit CRT dependant upon high percentage resynchronisation pacing ( &gt; 90 % ) patient atrial fibrillation intact AV node fail respond intermittent intrinsic conduction . In present investigation however , patient demonstrate dependency upon ventricular pace rate support . We therefore include patient atrial fibrillation study , albeit stratify randomisation ensure equally distribute upgrade standard generator change arm . 3 . Endpoints The primary endpoint improvement leave ventricular function measure left echocardiography . Secondary endpoint include change exercise capacity , renal function quality life score . 4 . Power calculation - Left ventricular function Previous short term study provide guide potential benefit upgrading RV pace system CRT . In patient important heart failure population 20 patient cross three month demonstrate improvement exercise capacity 1.5ml.kg.min-1 12.5 ( 2.9 ) ml.kg.min-1 14 ( 3.0 ) ml.kg.min-1 . There also improvement LVEF 26.1 ( 8 ) % 34.8 ( 9 ) % reduction BNP 2405pmol.l-1 ( normally distribute ) 1667pmol.l-1 . Each change significant less 0.02 level . - Exercise capacity Although patient randomised present proposal well baseline exercise capacity less severe ventricular dysfunction patient recruit previous study CRT , avoid potential disadvantage cross-over , follow longer . We therefore expect similar magnitude benefit ( 5 % improvement LV function 1.5 ml.kg.minÂ¬-1 ) . We estimate LV lead implant failure rate around 8 % , loss follow 5 % . Hence estimate identify significant difference power 90 % RV pacing CRT six month need recruit 50 patient ( 25 arm ) . Results analyse intention treat basis .</detailed_description>
