	<brief_summary>Forty percent patient require dialysis kidney failure die within three year mostly due heart disease . Heart failure high blood pressure common problem patient require dialysis key cause death due heart disease . Eplerenone drug effective improve heart failure reduce blood pressure patient require dialysis . There currently evidence tell physicians whether eplerenone would similar benefit patient require dialysis . This evidence reliably generate perform large scale study . Before study undertaken , investigator must determine whether eplerenone well tolerated safe patient require dialysis . The investigator perform initial small trial call Pilot trial Hemodialysis patient undergo Aldosterone antagoniSm Eplerenone ( PHASE ) determine eplerenone well tolerate , safe medication use large , global study show whether eplerenone reduces important outcome patient like death heart cause .</brief_summary>
