	<brief_title>Bevacizumab And Combination Chemotherapy Rectal Cancer Until Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study look two different combination anticancer drug see effective shrink cancer prevent come back surgery . Patients locally advanced rectal cancer sometimes treat radiotherapy , without chemotherapy , surgery . Radiotherapy treat main tumour rectum . This mean tiny deposit cancer spread part body ( metastasis ) , could continue grow . Giving chemotherapy radiotherapy together ( chemoradiotherapy ) treat main tumour spread . However , due side-effects ca n't give much chemotherapy combination radiotherapy chemotherapy give treatment possible metastasis may good could . If risk main tumour come back quite small , give treatment target metastases best option . This study look two well know combination chemotherapy drug : FOLFOX ( folinic acid , 5-fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ) FOLFOXIRI ( folinic acid , 5-fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ) . Chemotherapy work kill cancer cell . In addition , anticancer drug bevacizumab give FOLFOX FOLFOXIRI . Bevacizumab `` anti-angiogenesis '' drug . It work stop tumour make new blood vessel . Without new blood vessel , cancer cell get food oxygen need survive grow . Attacking cancer way may effective chemotherapy alone .</detailed_description>
