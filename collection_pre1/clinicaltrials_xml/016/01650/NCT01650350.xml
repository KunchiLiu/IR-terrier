	<brief_summary>scientifically evaluate whether Low Dose Naltrexone ( LDN ) activity refractory solid tumor within context phase II clinical study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Naltrexone Metastatic Melanoma , Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three type solid tumor study protocol : Melanoma , castrate resistant prostate cancer kidney cancer . Systemic chemotherapy may weaken immune system reduce potential response LDN . Therefore , patient must either previous chemotherapy patient must receive 1 prior chemotherapy regimen must complete least 6 month prior LDN . Systemic chemotherapy best modest activity melanoma , CRPC renal cancer . - Melanoma evaluate since respond patient Miriam Hospital melanoma . Immunomodulatory agent ipilimumab already demonstrate survival advantage melanoma . - Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) : It common CRPC patient rise PSA failure androgen deprivation . These patient may asymptomatic minimally symptomatic reluctance initiate treatment systemic chemotherapy standard docetaxel since agent substantial toxicity impair quality life . Waiting symptomatic disease progression patient CRPC rise PSA commonly utilize strategy . These patient excellent candidate treatment minimal toxicity LDA . The immunomodulatory agent Sipuleucel also improve survival prostate cancer suggest agent LDN could also helpful . - Renal cancer also study since disease activity immunomodulants IL-2 interferon . Targeted therapy generally use renal cancer . Chemotherapy minimal activity patient chemotherapy-naive .</detailed_description>
