	<brief_title>Gait Training With Executive Functions Tasks Subjects With Parkinson´s Disease : A Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study development implementation new protocol physical therapy training , base gait training associate executive task treatment individual Parkinson 's Disease . The propose motor training consist 30 minute global exercise involve stretch , muscle strengthen axial mobility exercise , , 30 minute gait train dual-task condition , associate distract task require handle main executive function . It open label study , non randomize , 30 patient PD stag 1 3 Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale participate study , hold Brazil Parkinson Association . The training consist 10 session , two time per week five week . The executive task concomitant gait training cover follow executive function : volition , self-awareness , planning , response inhibition , response monitoring attention . The main outcome measure : ( 1 ) Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) , ( 2 ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , ( 3 ) Trail Making Test A B , ( 4 ) Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) ( 5 ) Falls Efficacy Scale ( FES ) .</detailed_description>
