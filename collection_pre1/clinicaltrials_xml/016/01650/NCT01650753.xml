	<detailed_description>The study perform 14 week randomize crossover trial two treatment , one placebo . The randomization design provide collaborator Mead Johnson , study perform double blind , study staff inform nature product . Each treatment period consist one week baseline period , one fecal sample collect . This follow two week feed period probiotic administer constant dose 10^10 cell per day 50 100 ml either cold room temperature tab water . At day 7 14 ( last day feed ) , fecal sample collect . The last sample feed also serve day 0 Test Persistence ( TOP ) period . Persistence probiotic strain test TOP period day 4 , 8 , 16 , 28 ( 4 week ) total 7 fecal sample . The subject crossover treatment fecal sample collection repeat . Fecal sample provide subject use disposable stool collection container longer 2 hour defecation . In lab fecal sample store undiluted ( four aliquot ) 1/10 dilution PBS buffer ( four aliquot ) . The investigator also prepare five tube 1 gram aliquot fecal sample provide sample de-identified Mead Johnson Nutrition future analysis . Experimental design . Fecal sample study qRT-PCR . Fecal sample may subject pyrosequencing selective culturing . All subject fill Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) questionnaire ( week GSRS week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 8 , 9 , 10 11 ) test acceptance safety strain , test subject remain eligible study . Weeks 1 8 baseline visit , week 4 11 one week subject stop take study product .
