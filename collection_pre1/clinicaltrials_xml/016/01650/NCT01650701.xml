	<brief_summary>The purpose study find lenalidomide give along rituximab help control disease also increase length response ( complete partial response ) compare standard care rituximab chemotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Open Label Randomized Study Compare Efficacy Safety Rituximab Plus Lenalidomide ( CC-5013 ) Versus Rituximab Plus Chemotherapy Followed Rituximab Subjects With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) cancer B lymphocyte , type white blood cell . FL typically slowly progress incurable disease . Follicular lymphoma cell produce specific defect patient 's immune system impair ability control cancer . Lenalidomide show reverse specific immune defect cause FL patient . By include lenalidomide , RELEVANCE study aim eliminate cancer restore patient 's immune competence .</detailed_description>
