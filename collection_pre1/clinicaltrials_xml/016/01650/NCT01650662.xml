	<brief_summary>Infarct size major determinant prognosis myocardial infarction ( MI ) . It report Cyclosporine A ( CsA ) administer immediately prior percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) significantly could reduce reperfusion injury consequently infarct size ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) patient . CYCLE trial multicenter , control , randomize open label study , blind assessment endpoint measure . The objective determine whether single i.v . dose CsA within 6 hour onset symptom STEMI 444 patient , improve outcomes successful primary PCI , reduce myocardial injury associate reperfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The possibility optimize result early effective reopening occlude artery reducing/avoiding impact so-called reperfusion injury many year one elusive objectives pharmacological research , evolve hypothesis target . A recently publish trial provide support line investigation focus role mitochondrial dysfunction , so-called permeability transition , cause irreversible myocardial injury associate reperfusion . In fact , single dose widely use immunosuppressant agent , CsA , potent inhibitor mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening , report limit ischemia−reperfusion injury 50 patient anterior MI underwent primary PCI . Since infarct size leave ventricular function main determinant long-term morbidity mortality , single measure limit infarct size potential clinical benefit . Therefore result previously mention trial replicate large sample size , go trial clinical endpoint . - Sample size Assuming incidence primary endpoint 55 % control group , calculate 444 patient ( 222 patient per group ) require study 80 % power detect 25 % relative improvement ( result endpoint frequency 68.7 % CsA group ) 5 % drop-out rate two-sided alpha level 5 % . The size trial allow investigate treatment benefit secondary endpoint hsTnT : assume concentration 2.7 ng/mL day 4 ( common SD=2.1 ) control group , study 90 % power show 25 % reduction CsA two-sided alpha level 5 % . - Safety Adverse event intravenous CsA ( i.e . anaphylactoid reactions/anaphylactic shock , acute renal failure , hypertensive crisis ) report rare . In trial , patient receive one iv dose CsA , therefore expect low probability adverse effect relate repeated administration , i.e . acute renal failure hypertensive crisis . Nonetheless close monitoring safety single dose CsA foreseen monthly examination data safety Steering Committee .</detailed_description>
