	<brief_summary>Currently , standard wound care practice suboptimal assess wound remodel bacterial infection real-time . An alternative complimentary mean provide real-time image connective tissue re-modeling bacterial infection may greatly increase early detection infection thus lead rapid therapeutic intervention . Our new device , PRODIGI ( TM ) , image tissue bacterial autofluorescence ( without agent ) may provide clinically-important capability . In preliminary preclinical testing , investigator discover wound illuminated violet/blue light , endogenous collagen connective tissue matrix emit characteristic green fluorescent signal , pathogenic bacterial specie emit unique red fluorescence signal due production endogenous porphyrin . Therefore , autofluorescence imaging , exogenous contrast agent need imaging , make approach particularly appeal diagnostic imaging method clinical use . The investigator hypothesize real-time imaging tissue autofluorescence signal emanate endogenous connective tissue ( e.g . collagen ) pathogenic bacteria within complex wound use determine heal status ( i.e. , collagen re-modeling wound closure ) , detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection occult standard clinical white light evaluation , guide intervention wound care .</brief_summary>
