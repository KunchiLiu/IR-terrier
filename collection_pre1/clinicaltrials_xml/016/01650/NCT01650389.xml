	<brief_summary>Rationale : The Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine protect child disseminate tuberculosis ( TB ) include TB meningitis miliary TB , efficacy pulmonary TB inconsistent among child adult . Administration live attenuate BCG infant know HIV infect contraindicated World Health Organization ( WHO ) , due risk serious vaccine adverse event ( BCG disease . Developing country , lack capacity integration early infant HIV test infant vaccination schedule , fully implement WHO guideline BCG vaccination HIV expose infant . Newborn infant HIV infect mother continue receive routine BCG HIV infection exclude . Clinical trial new viral-vectored TB vaccine , include MVA85A , modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) vaccine express Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85A , date enrol infant already vaccinate routine BCG birth . However , TB vaccination regimen depend newborn BCG remain unsafe HIV infect infant . Infants HIV infect mother , constitute 29 % baby bear South Africa 2009 , would benefit new TB vaccination strategy , BCG delay HIV infection exclude . These HIV expose infant also great increase risk TB disease . Testing safety immunogenicity MVA85A vaccine prime , follow selective delayed BCG boost , HIV expose newborn , critical step towards delivery new TB vaccine regimen safe effective infant , regardless HIV exposure . Study Design : Double blind , randomise , control trial . HIV expose infant randomise 1:1 receive single dose , intradermal MVA85A vaccine Candin® control birth . The first 60 infant enrol trial form pilot safety cohort formal Data Monitoring &amp; Ethics Committee ( DMEC ) safety review . Thereafter , safety immunogenicity outcomes measure infant . Study Population : Infants ( n=340 ) bear HIV infect mother receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) Prevention Mother Child Transmission ( PMTCT ) prophylaxis . Sites : Worcester ( University Cape Town ) Khayelitsha ( Stellenbosch University ) , South Africa Study Intervention : Newborn infant receive 1 x 108 pfu MVA85A vaccine Candin® control intradermal injection . Infants confirm HIV uninfected HIV PCR receive BCG Vaccine SSI 8 week age . Infants confirm HIV infect HIV PCR receive BCG . Primary specific aim : To evaluate safety MVA85A give birth HIV expose uninfected infant . To evaluate safety BCG give 8 week age HIV expose uninfected infant , use MVA85A prime BCG boost strategy . Secondary specific aim : To evaluate immunogenicity MVA85A give birth HIV expose uninfected infant . To evaluate immunogenicity BCG give 8 week age HIV expose uninfected infant , use MVA85A prime BCG boost strategy . Safety endpoint : Local , regional , systemic adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . Immunology endpoint : Frequencies CD4 CD8 T cell produce 4 cytokine ( IL-17 , IFN-γ , TNF-α , IL-2 ) , polyfunctional combination cytokine simultaneously , follow stimulation antigen Ag85A BCG , measure whole blood intracellular cytokine assay ( WB-ICS ) . Specific proliferative capacity CD8 CD4 T cell produce three cytokine ( IFN-γ , TNF-α , and/or IL-2 ) combination cytokine simultaneously , measure novel whole blood 6-day lymphoproliferative flow cytometric assay ( WB-prolif ) . Relative proportion absolute number peripheral blood myeloid lymphoid cell subset , measure directly ex vivo flow cytometry . Study group : The first 60 infant enrol Study Group 1 undergo intensive safety evaluation , follow DMEC review Day-28 safety data . The DMEC make formal recommendation continuation enrollment and/or change protocol , base safety review . Study Groups 2-5 evaluate clinical safety immunology outcome . Statistical Analysis : Cumulative 12-month incidence local , regional , systemic AEs , category , compare HIV expose uninfected subject receive MVA85A vaccine Candin® control birth . The sample size 90 % probability detect SAE true occurrence rate 1.5 % infant receive MVA85A vaccine 80 % power detect 15 % difference rate non-serious AEs ( 20 % compare 35 % ) two study arm ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Multivariate model build explore longitudinal immunological data identify independent association MVA85A vaccination covariates interest .</brief_summary>
