	<brief_title>Indirect Assessment Intervention Perinatal Drug Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two factor limit potential brief intervention reduction substance abuse HIV risk . First , ability conduct intervention dependent upon willingness disclose drug use risky sexual behavior . This significant obstacle give evidence half drug-positive individuals-particularly woman perinatal period-report use . Second , logistic financial obstacle implement even brief intervention program , particularly regard time , train provider willingness . In response limitation , NIDA support ( DA018975 ) , Parent Health Lab Wayne State University School Medicine develop validate sensitive indirect screener evaluate correlate illicit drug use rather drug use . The Lab also develop brief computer-delivered intervention design build change motivation without presume presence risk accompany screener . This intervention demonstrate excellent feasibility acceptability Phase I test . Following NIDA 's Stage Model Behavioral Therapy Development , propose study take next step validate computer-delivered indirect screen intervention process Phase II/Stage IIb trial woman determine risk indirect drug use screener . In addition , give 47.8 % prior sample 's participant STI point life , propose study also expand exist focus HIV risk . Specifically , plan : ( ) continue development validation WIDUS screener via concomitant collection WIDUS protocols hair/urine sample , well build ability indirectly predict HIV risk ; ( b ) revise upgrade draft indirect intervention base expert participant informant feedback ; ( c ) recruit 500 at-risk woman urban obstetric hospital ; ( ) randomly assign participant intervention control condition , blind follow-up assessment 3- 6-months . If proven efficacious , logistically feasible , replicable , low-cost approach could allow dramatic increase reach -- therefore population impact -- brief intervention drug use among at-risk post-partum woman . Further , impact maternal drug use would multiply indirect effect at-risk child .</detailed_description>
