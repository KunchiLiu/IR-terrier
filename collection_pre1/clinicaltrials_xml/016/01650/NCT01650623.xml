	<brief_summary>The aim study compare two physical therapy training consist gait training distinguish one associate task require handle main executive function , perform individual Parkinson 's Disease . The investigator hypothesis experimental group ( EG ) , hold gait training higher cognitive demand ( dual-task condition ) , make improvement parameter measure ( functionality gait cognitive ability ) great extent compare control group ( CG ) , hold gait training without executive task ( single-task condition ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Training With Executive Functions Tasks Subjects With Parkinson´s Disease : A Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare two physical therapy training consist gait training distinguish one associate task require handle main executive function ( protocol design team ) , perform individual Parkinson 's Disease . Both training consist 30 minute global exercise involve stretch , muscle strengthen axial mobility exercise , follow difference : - experimental group ( EG ) hold another 30 minute gait train dual-task condition associate distract task require handle main executive function ; - control group ( CG ) hold additional 30 minute gait train without associate task . It prospective study , single blind , randomize , 30 patient PD stag 1 3 Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale participate study , hold Brazil Parkinson Association . Patients randomized experimental control group , 15 one . The training consist 10 session , two time per week five week . The executive task concomitant gait training cover follow executive function : volition , self-awareness , planning , response inhibition , response monitoring attention . The main outcome measure : ( 1 ) Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) , ( 2 ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , ( 3 ) Trail Making Test A B , ( 4 ) Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) ( 5 ) Falls Efficacy Scale ( FES ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Idiopathic PD perform neurologist specialist movement disorder ; In use dopaminergic medication ; Disease severity 1 3 accord Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale ; Absence neurological disorder comorbidities may affect gait ; Absence dementia ( score 24 Mini Mental State Examination MMSE ) ; Vision hear adequate correct normal ; Ability walk independently ; Absence prolong state ; Age 50 85 year . Biomechanical alteration ( pathology ) could compromise completion training ; Presence depression , detect Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS15 ) ; Presence neurological , auditory visual deficit could compromise distract task performance gait training ; Any change drug treatment PD .</criteria>
