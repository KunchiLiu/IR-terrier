	<detailed_description>Objective evaluate demineralization remineralization effect two experimental fluoride contain dentrifices enamel root surface lesion compare control dentrifice . Study partially randomize , 3-period cross study involve 30 subject need full-coverage crown posterior tooth . Each subject use study dentrifices 3 month accord randomization scheme . Subjects brush daily assign dentrifice unsupervised . Subjects two provisonal crown use study . These crown contain three hard tooth tissue section locate interproximal site . The three tooth tissue slabs consist artificial enamel caries lesion , artificial root caries lesion , sound root . After removal , tooth slabs evaluate use polarize light photomicrograph change area depth lesion .</detailed_description>
