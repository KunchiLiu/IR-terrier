	<brief_summary>Oxalate restrict diet routinely prescribed clinical practice nephrolithiasis patient hyperoxaluria . The effect dietary oxalate urinary oxalate however controversial . Some study implicate dietary oxalate major risk factor nephrolithiasis . The Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet , high fruit vegetable , moderate low-fat dairy product , low animal protein represent novel potential mean kidney stone prevention . The effect DASH-style diet relative urinary supersaturations however uncertain . Higher consumption fruit vegetable may increase urinary oxalate also increase urinary citrate , important inhibitor calcium saturation.All data lead u hypothesize DASH diet oxalate restrict diet , routinely administer clinical practice , might beneficial lower urinary relative supersaturations calcium oxalate recurrent stone former hyperoxaluria . Recurrent stone former hyperoxaluria ( urine oxalate &gt; 32.8 ) allocate 2 group . The first group prescribe oxalate restrict diet . The second group ask follow calorie-controlled DASH diet plan drink water amount . 24-h urine collect 2 time study visit baseline , 1 time week 6 2 time end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison DASH With Oxalate Restricted Diet Urine Recurrent Stone Formers With Hyperoxaluria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After run-in period 3 week patient allocate 2 group . The first group prescribe oxalate restrict diet . They instruct avoid oxalate-rich food spinach , rhubarb , beet , chocolate , cereal , nut , tea , wheat bran , strawberry drink water amount roughly 2 L cold weather 3 L warm/hot weather . The second group ask follow calorie-controlled DASH diet plan . DASH eat pattern recommend 2005 Department Health Human Services Dietary Guidelines Americans model healthy eating majority individual population . This group eat diet include high fruit , vegetable , low-fat dairy product lower saturate fat , total fat , cholesterol , contain whole grain fewer refine grain , sweet , red meat . The calcium , potassium , magnesium DASH diet high . The DASH diet contain 2,400 mg Na per day . The serving , mention publication National Institutes Health regard DASH eating plan , use practical guideline . Lower consumption meat high consumption low-fat dairy , vegetable , fruit , whole-grain cereal , legume distinguish DASH trial weight-reduction diet . We determine caloric need person group individually accord Harris Benedict Formula : Metric BMR Formula Women : BMR= 655 + ( 9.6 × weight kilo ) + ( 1.8 × height cm ) - ( 4.7 × age year ) Men : BMR= 66 + ( 13.7 × weight kilo ) + ( 5 × height cm ) - ( 6.8 × age year ) To determine total daily calorie need , multiply BMR appropriate activity factor , follow : If sedentary ( little exercise ) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.2 If lightly active ( light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week ) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.375 If moderately active ( moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week ) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.55 If active ( hard exercise/sports 6-7 day week ) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.725 If extra active ( hard exercise/sports &amp; physical job 2x training ) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.9 The patient visit begin , 6 week end study ; session patient 45-60 min . They touch nutritionist phone every week . The nutritionist explain benefit diet patient tell continue diet , relate metabolic abnormality might control . The diet individually prescribe use calorie count system , exchange list give patient exchange food item count calorie . A nutritionist educates subject use exchange list . Patient compliance diet evaluate detailed food recall 3 day collect 2 weekday 1 weekend day week 1 week 12 well evaluation urinary excretion sodium , inorganic sulfate total nitrogen . The food recall review nutrition PhD submit analyzed use nutritionist IV software . 24-h urine also collect 2 time study visit baseline , 2 time end study day food recall fill . Urinary supersaturation calcium oxalate , calcium phosphate uric acid also calculate begin end study . Because dietary intervention , patient blind . Clinical measurement include blood pressure , weight , height , waist circumference . Blood pressure measurement average 2 measurement take use automated system subject seat 5 minute . Participants weigh wear minimal clothing without shoe . Height measure stand position , without shoe . Waist circumference measure waist narrow light clothing . Body mass index ( kg/m2 ) calculate weight ( kg ) divide height square ( m2 ) We use General Linear Models ( paired test ) globally compare mean variable end 2 different diet period without adjustment weight . We calculate percent change variable use formula ( E- B/B ) ×100 , E end treatment value B baseline value . Groups compare use percent change General Linear Model ( paired test ) analyse . We use ANCOVA compare adjust mean end value percent change weight change include covariate . Results consider significant 2-tailed P-value &lt; ,0.05 . Statistical analysis perform use STATA 15.0 .</detailed_description>
