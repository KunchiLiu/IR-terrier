The investigator collect clinical outcome data relate OCD severity , individual family function four time point Group 1 subject two time point Group 2 subject . For Group 1 subject , time point include baseline , midpoint , completion 12 session , one-month follow-up ( time point +/- one week ) . For Group 2 subject , time point baseline time delay equivalent completion 12 GF-CBT session .
