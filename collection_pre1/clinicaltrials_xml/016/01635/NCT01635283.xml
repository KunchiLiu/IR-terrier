	<brief_title>Vaccine Patients With Newly Diagnosed Recurrent Low-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 5-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) , use intradermal injection autologous dendritic cell harvest peripheral blood precursor pulse ( co-cultured ) tumor lysate derive surgical tissue patient low-grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To monitor overall survival ( OS ) , cellular immune response brain tumor patient injected tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 0 , 14 , 28 .</detailed_description>
