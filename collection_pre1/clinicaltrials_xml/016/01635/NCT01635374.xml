	<brief_summary>Achalasia esophageal motility disease usually require surgical intervention ( esophagomyotomy ) . Laparoscopic technique reduce morbidity associate myotomy , post-op GERD , wound infection , hernia incisional pain common . A new NOTES base procedure , per-oral endoscopic esophagomyotomy ( POEM ) , develop eliminates need skin incision . All patient enrol study , thorough pre-op workup ( include upper endoscopy , upper GI radiograph , high resolution esophageal manometry ) confirm diagnosis achalasis Northwestern Esophageal Center . In procedure , perform operating room general anesthesia , flexible endoscope pass esophagus , mucosal flap submucosal tunnel create . This tunnel extend onto stomach . The inner circular muscle layer low esophagus sphincter ( LES ) identify myotomy start 3-4cm distal mucosal flap carry way onto stomach . The mucosal open closed standard endoscopic clip . Patients admit hospital gastrograffin esophagram perform post-op day 1 rule esophageal leak . All patient 2-3 week post-op appointment Patients confirm diagnosis achalasia may offer POEM . The investigator hypothesize POEM feasible safe effectively reduce residual LES pressure ( determined manometry ) improve patient symptoms quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Per-Oral Endoscopic Esophagomyotomy ( POEM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator propose use surgical technique eliminate skin incision patient undergo esophagomyotomy . All patient standard pre-operative esophageal work-up may include upper endoscopy ( EGD ) , endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , upper GI X-rays , high-resolution manometry , pH , FLIP impedance measurement study . Once diagnosis achalasia confirm , patient offer POEM standard treatment achalasia . All patient undergo POEM review sign study consent prior procedure . Operative recovery room time well hospital length stay collect . During hospital stay , severity pain , use pain medication complication record . Patients remain NPO 1 day . Post-op day 1 , patient receive esophagram rule esophageal perforation . If normal , patient start clear liquid advance full liquid diet 1 week post-op . Patients return evaluate surgeon two week follow procedure . At visit , post-operative complication note patient 's medical record . Additionally visit preoperative visit , patient complete standardize Quality Life ( QOL ) assessment ( i.e. , SF-36 ) . Perceived pain level type frequency pain medication record patient 's medical record . Patients return 6 week post-op complete second set questionnaire high resolution manometry perform assess residual LES pressure . The potential advantage patient enter study include mention regard elimination post-operative wound infection hernia also lack abdominal incision may reduce pain recovery time likely cosmetic advantage well . Potential risk study include associate use flexible endoscopic instrument include esophageal perforation , bleed sore throat . In addition , possibility may new , unanticipated complication modify surgical technique . Patient risk mitigate procedure perform surgeon expertise laparoscopic esophageal surgery , flexible endoscopy NOTES , well involvement skilled interventional gastroenterologist deem necessary . The principle investigator ( primary surgeon procedure ) perform multiple pre-clinical animal cadaver POEM procedures travel Yokohama , Japan observe human POEM case perform Dr. Haru Inoue . This feasibility study initially evaluate potential benefit , risk impact patient 's quality life modify surgical technique 20 patient . Once standardized technique establish risk show low , prospective comparative evaluation plan compare modify technique standard laparoscopic approach .</detailed_description>
