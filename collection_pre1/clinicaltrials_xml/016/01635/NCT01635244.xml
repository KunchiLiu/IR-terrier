	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Assess hemodynamic difference rest exercise three clinically available tissue aortic valve . 2 . Assess difference leave ventricular ( LV ) reverse remodel ( recovery LV hypertrophy , change LV systolic diastolic function ) aortic valve replacement severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) three clinically available aortic valve bioprosthesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Various aortic valve prosthesis unique hemodynamic characteristic , on-going interest define hemodynamic characteristic interest avoid residual LV outflow obstruction prosthesis-patient mismatch ( residual LV outflow obstruction despite normally function prosthesis ) aortic valve replacement . Attempts compare hemodynamics prosthesis limit different size system use various manufacturer ( preclude meaningful comparison valve valve size ) biological variability vivo gradient effective orifice area valve ( make potentially small difference hemodynamics difficult detect ) . Assessment hemodynamics increase cardiac output associate exercise test use well define potentially subtle difference hemodynamics valve prosthesis . In addition , assessment change LV geometry ( notably include LV hypertrophy ) aortic valve replacement use surrogate marker aortic prosthesis hemodynamics .</detailed_description>
