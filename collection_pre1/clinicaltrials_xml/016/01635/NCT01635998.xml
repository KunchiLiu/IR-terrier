	<brief_summary>The objective H-FIB trial determine role renal sympathetic denervation prevention Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) recurrence patient hypertension catheter-based AF ablation procedure plan . Patients randomize either AF catheter ablation ( usual therapy ) AF catheter ablation plus renal sympathetic denervation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Renal Denervation Treatment Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine potential additional benefit perform renal sympathetic denervation time AF ablation procedure , order improve long-term success AF procedure . To take part study , must meet study requirement . Screening visit test procedures physical exam , blood pressure , review medical history , blood sample , Transthoracic Echocardiogram ( TTE ) do see eligible study . Patients qualify study provide consent undergo catheter ablation AF . Very thin electrode catheter , similar long wire , insert blood vessel groin . Using ablation catheter , `` ablate '' damage tissue adjacent pulmonary vein behave normally . Immediately follow catheter ablation , patient undergo renal angiogram order assess suitability catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation . A renal angiogram x-ray study blood vessel kidney evaluate blockage , abnormality could affect blood supply kidney . It perform inject contrast dye catheter ( tiny tube ) blood vessel kidney .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Age ≥ 18 year age History AF ( paroxysmal persistent ) plan guidelinesupported catheter ablation procedure History significant hypertension ( define SBP ≥160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥100 mmHg ) receive treatment least one antihypertensive medication OR Clinical History hypertension receive treatment least two antihypertensive medication ( specifically blood pressure reduction ) . Renal vasculature accessible determined intraprocedural renal angiography . Ability understand requirement study Willingness adhere study restriction , comply postprocedural followup requirement sign inform consent Exclusion Criteria Inability undergo AF catheter ablation ( e.g. , presence leave atrial thrombus , contraindication anticoagulation ) Prior leave atrial ablation atrial arrhythmia ( index procedure ) Patients NYHA class IV congestive heart failure Individual known secondary hypertension Individual renal artery anatomy ineligible treatment include : 1 . Inability access renal vasculature 2 . Main renal artery &lt; 3 mm diameter &lt; 20 mm length . 3 . Hemodynamically anatomically significant renal artery abnormality stenosis either renal artery , eye operator , would interfere safe cannulation renal artery meet standard surgical repair interventional dilation . 4 . A history prior renal artery intervention include balloon angioplasty stenting precludes possibility ablation treatment . Individual estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 45mL/min/1.73m2 , use MDRD calculation . Individual single function kidney ( either congenitally iatrogenically ) . Individual pregnant nursing . Life expectancy &lt; 1 year medical condition</criteria>
