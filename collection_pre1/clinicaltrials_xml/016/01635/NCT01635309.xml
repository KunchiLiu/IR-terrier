	<brief_summary>Worldwide 200 million adult annually undergo major noncardiac surgery 5 million patient suffer major vascular complication . Despite magnitude problem capacity predict event limit . Although perioperative myocardial infarction ( MI ) common major perioperative cardiac complication , little known pathophysiology . Coronary compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) potential non-invasive method detection coronary artery disease cardiac risk stratification non-operative setting ; however , value test enhance risk prediction among patient schedule noncardiac surgery unknown . This study international prospective cohort study determine among patient , risk , atherosclerotic disease undergo noncardiac surgery : 1 ) preoperative coronary CTA additional predictive value occurrence major perioperative cardiac event 2 ) underlie coronary anatomy associate perioperative MIs .</brief_summary>
