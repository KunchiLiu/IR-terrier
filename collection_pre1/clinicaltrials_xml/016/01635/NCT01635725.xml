	<brief_title>New Bowel Preparation Scale Measuring Colon Cleanliness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early study bowel preparation colonoscopy rely scale measure cleanliness colon validate sensitive difference preparation quality . Often scale would simply describe bowel preparation adequate inadequate base endoscopist 's judgment quality overall preparation . An ideal bowel cleanliness scale would : 1 . Produce score reproducible endoscopist endoscopist ( validate ) . 2 . Be easy endoscopist use . 3 . Produce score easily convert poor/fair/good/excellent subjective rating scale often used gastroenterologist colonoscopy report . 4 . Produce score easily convert adequate/inadequate subjective rating scale often used gastroenterologist colonoscopy report . 5 . Recognize truly outstanding preparation 100 % mucosa well visualize without cleaning require . 6 . Recognize adequate preparation ( ability visualize mucosa ) , also measure effort require clean colon residual liquid . In 2004 , study validate Ottawa Preparation Scale ( OPS ) publish ( Rostom , Jolicoeur , 2004 ) . A description score system : Ottawa Preparation Scale ( OPS ) rating colon segment 4=Inadequate ( Solid stool clear wash suction ) 3=Poor ( Necessary wash suction obtain reasonable view ) 2=Fair ( Necessary suction liquid adequately view segment ) 1=Good ( Minimal turbid fluid segment ) 0=Excellent ( Mucosal detail clearly visible ) Ottawa Preparation Scale ( OPS ) rating amount fluid whole colon 2=Lots fluid 1=Moderate fluid 0=Little fluid OPS calculate add rating right , transverse/descending sigmoid/rectum colon segment rating fluid whole colon . The overall OPS report 14 ( poor ) 0 ( excellent ) . Although OPS major improvement previous cleanliness scale , number significant problem OPS : 1 . The segment rat easily define endoscopist , especially demarcation descend colon sigmoid colon . 2 . The segment score base much cleaning required view mucosa segment , rather quality ultimate view mucosa . Although preferred colon require cleaning , ultimate view mucosa important . 3 . Adequate inadequate preparation correlate OPS score . For example , 2 segment rat Excellent one rat Inadequate , total score would 4 - colon cleanse would adequate good quality colonoscopy . If necessary suction liquid 3 segment , total score would 6 - colon cleansing still would adequate might even excellent cleaning . 4 . The OPS suffers poorly design score system easily convert poor/fair/good/excellent subjective rating scale often used gastroenterologist colonoscopy report . 5 . The OPS penalize liquid colon necessarily correlate poor quality view mucosa . Preparations give split dos ( half night half morning procedure ) tend wet less time preparation pas body . As long fluid clear easily suction colonoscopy , negatively impact ultimate view mucosa . In 2009 , study validate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) publish ( Edwin , Calderwood , et al. , 2009 ) . A description score system : Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) rating colon segment 0=Unprepared colon segment stool clear 1 . Portion mucosa segment see cleaning , area see due retain material 2 . Minor residual material cleaning , mucosa segment generally well see 3 . Entire mucosa segment well see wash BBPS calculate add rating right , transverse leave colon segment . The overall BBPS report 0 ( poor ) 9 ( excellent ) . The BBPS simpler endoscopist use OPS , rat ultimate cleanliness colon rather effort require clean colon , segment colon endoscopist rat anatomically easy define . Still , number significant problem BBPS : 1 . Adequate inadequate preparation correlate BBPS score . For example , entire mucosa 2 segment well see one segment Unprepared , score would 6 - colon cleanse would adequate good quality colonoscopy . If minor residual material clean 3 segment , score would also 6 - colon cleanse would adequate good quality colonoscopy . 2 . The BBPS suffers poorly design score system easily convert poor/fair/good/excellent subjective rating scale often used gastroenterologist colonoscopy report . 3 . The BBPS penalize liquid colon . While liquid remove necessarily correlate poor view mucosa , preparation clean colon well leave dry would prefer . 4 . A truly outstanding colon preparation would allow 100 % mucosa view without cleaning . The BBPS sensitive truly outstanding preparation since penalize effort require clean colon . 5 . Segments colon rat 1 BBPS vary greatly cleanliness . For example , colon 3 segment 2 % mucosa well see could receive BBPS score 3 preparation would good excellent . Another colon segment 50 % mucosa well see could receive BBPS score 3 preparation would poor . We propose study new bowel preparation scale call `` Chicago Bowel Preparation Scale '' overcome limitation previous preparation scale .</detailed_description>
