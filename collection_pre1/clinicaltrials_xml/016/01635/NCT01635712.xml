	<detailed_description>SNX-5422 prodrug SNX-2112 . Correlation observe Hsp90 client protein level change functional effect cell vitro study SNX-2112 , support inhibition Hsp90 mechanism action compound . SNX-5422 demonstrated significant antitumor activity mouse xenograft model human tumor , include breast ( BT474 , MX-1 ) , colon ( HT29 ) , prostate ( PC3 ) , melanoma ( A375 ) multiple oral dosing regimen . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study mice , rat , dog show high bioavailability SNX-2112 follow oral administration SNX 5422 . In mouse xenograft study , SNX-2112 selectively retain tumor tissue compare tissue . This study employ critical risk management feature include use NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.03 , provide scale consistently grade severity AEs , toxicity criterion analyse dose escalation , frequent laboratory clinical observation , correlation AEs plasma concentration SNX-5422 SNX-2112 , monitor QTc interval appropriate time point , conservative dose-escalation scheme .</detailed_description>
