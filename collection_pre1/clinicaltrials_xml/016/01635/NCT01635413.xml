	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare relative efficacy tai chi strength training prevent fall female cancer survivor . II . Determine mechanism tai chi strength training reduces risk fall . III . Determine well benefit intervention persist structure training stop . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify compare relative efficacy tai chi resistance exercise biomarkers common cancer progression cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) woman cancer survivor . ( Optional ancillary study ) II . Quantify compare relative efficacy tai chi resistance exercise biomarkers unique CVD woman cancer survivor . ( Optional ancillary study ) III . Determine influence initial change adiposity change biomarkers exercise . ( Optional ancillary study ) IV . Explore effect exercise train biomarker accelerate age woman cancer survivor . ( Optional ancillary study ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients attend strength training class 1 hour 2 day per week . ARM II : Patients attend tai chi class 1 hour 2 day per week . ARM III : Patients attend supervise stretch relaxation class 1 hour 2 day per week . In arm , treatment continue 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
