	<detailed_description>Specific Aims We examine impact moderate intensity aerobic motor skill exercise intervention improve gait cognition old adult slow gait psychomotor slow . In thrice weekly , 12 week , randomize clinical trial , propose follow aim : 1 ) define impact moderate intensity aerobic motor skill gait exercise thinking walking , 2 ) define impact moderate intensity aerobic motor skill gait exercise gait cognition . Brief Background The optimal exercise improve gait brain health old adult know . Two type exercise potential affect gait brain health , aerobic motor skill exercise , develop distinct discipline study separately , old adult age-related , centrally-generated slow gait dysfunction effect integrate measure gait cognition , 'walking think ' . Summary Methods We propose two parallel , single arm clinical trial define impact aerobic motor-skill exercise gait cognitive function , community-dwelling old adult slow gait psychomotor slowing , randomly assign moderate intensity aerobic gait ( n=12 ) motor skill gait ( n=12 ) exercise , three time week , 12 week , small group 2-3 supervised physical therapist . Primary outcomes integrated measure think walking , secondary outcome specific measure gait cognitive function collect pre , 4 , 8 12 week post intervention , examine impact exercise dose-response effect gait cognition . Future Use Data The intent propose pilot generate complementary data essential support R01 clinical trial grant submission . Specifically pilot : 1 ) recruit old adult slow gait speed evidence psychomotor slowing , 2 ) explore define primary outcome measure integrate gait cognition , thus good represent goal exercise intervention - think walking , 3 ) determine potential mean variability estimate gait cognitive outcome , particularly less well-characterized gait outcome aerobic exercise ( energy expenditure walking , gait variability , gait abnormality ) , cognitive outcome motor skill exercise ( speed processing , executive function ) .</detailed_description>
