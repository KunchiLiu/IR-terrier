	<brief_title>Aspirin Versus Clopidogrel Effect Uterine Blood Flow Women With Unexplained Recurrent Miscarriages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent miscarriage associate genetic , anatomic , endocrine , immunologic , behavioral , environmental factor prothrombotic state ; however , almost 50 % case recurrent miscarriage unexplained . Angiogenesis uterine blood supply essential endometrial growth embryo development . As result , endometrial vascularity consider play critical role endometrial receptivity formation pregnancy maintenance . The development three-dimensional ( 3D ) ultra-sonography power Doppler angiography provide objective reproducible way determine endometrial-subendometrial vascularity , may evaluate quantitatively uterine vascularity microenvironment develop embryo . Few study show application 3D-power Doppler angiography assessment pregnancy loss . The rationale behind use aspirin substance , low dos , produce vasodilatatory effect shift TXA2/PGI2 ratio toward dominance PGI2 activity inhibition TXA2 production . TXA2 synthesize mainly platelet induces platelet aggregation vasoconstriction , whereas PGI2 , produce level vascular endothelial cell , inhibits platelet aggregation promotes vasodilatation . Aspirin , low dos , proven produce selective inhibition TXA2 production . In fact , TXA2 primarily produce activity cyclooxygenase prostaglandin synthase-1 ( COX-1 ) platelet level , highly sensitive aspirin inhibition . In contrast , PGI2 mainly synthesize endothelial cell activity COX-1 COX-2 , insensitive aspirin administration low dos . Therefore , administration aspirin low dos reduces TXA2 production without affect PGI2 secretion . It reasonable increase PGI2 vasodilatation activity enhance uterine perfusion , thereby improve reproductive outcome . In addition , hypothesize aspirin administration reduce TXA2 endometrial cell excretion . It known TXA2 level site embryo implantation crucial success pregnancy . The presence lower endometrial cell TXA2 production demonstrate patient become pregnant respect achieve pregnancy . For reason , low dose Aspirin supplementation currently consider effective safe treatment option prevention several pregnancy complication . Nevertheless , aspirin even administer low dos cause gastrointestinal bleeding , report study use 30-50 mg daily . In addition , prove enteric-coated buffered aspirin less likely cause gastrointestinal bleeding normal aspirin . The search active anti-platelet drug within original chemical class thienopyridines , lead discovery clopidogrel , novel ADP-selective agent whose anti-aggregating property several time high ticlopidine . The anti-aggregating property compound well know , recently , new result clarify mechanism action . Clopidogrel active intravenous oral administration , circulate activity find plasma treat animal human volunteer . Experiments rat demonstrate anti-aggregating activity cause short last metabolite generate liver cytochrome P450-dependent pathway . The anti-aggregating property clopidogrel cause inhibition bind ADP platelet receptor , specifically low affinity receptor , high affinity bind site unaffected clopidogrel . Several event ADP activation process , include adenylyl cyclase down-regulation , protein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation GPIIb-IIIa complex , fibrinogen binding , aggregation release , inhibit clopidogrel indicate close relationship activation low affinity receptor ADP . Thus , clopidogrel potent antithrombotic drug human also good tool study effect ADP platelet . The purpose study compare effect Aspirin versus clopidogrel effect uterine perfusion woman unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss decrease uterine artery pulsatility index .</detailed_description>
