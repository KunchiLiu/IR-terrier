	<brief_summary>The purpose study build scientific evidence base training delivery depressive symptom education program , develop local community member , call Resiliency Class ( RC ) . The RC strong element Cognitive Behavioral Therapy design deliver psycho-educational class non-professionals improve mood . Depressive symptom common , especially low-income , minority community . Depressive symptoms n't meet DSM-IV criterion Major Depression still carry significant amount disability . Interventions address sub-threshold depressive symptom note result decrease likelihood depression diminish use mental health service . Few intervention use health education / health promotion focus design deliver non-professionals address individual mild moderate depressive symptom low income , minority community . This project take place Centinela Valley , roughly correspond Service Planning Area ( SPA ) 6 South Los Angeles ( SLA ) . This single-blind , randomized trial utilize wait-list control design half participant enrol study randomize Resiliency Class ( 7 session ) half go wait-list control condition receive 2 case management call referral social service . We propose screen 1500 client detect 450 participant depressive symptom ( endorsed one item PHQ-2 ) . We plan enroll 400 participant , 200 resiliency class 200 wait-list control condition . Primary outcome measure include depressive symptom , function , measure resiliency . We assess measure baseline 3 month completion Resiliency Class wait-list condition . After completion first round class , conduct preliminary analysis impact resiliency class versus wait-list control case management call depressive symptom . If resiliency class improve depressive symptom wait-list control , offer wait-list control access resiliency class disseminate resiliency class training . We hypothesize resiliency class lead great reduction client depressive symptom wait-list case management call randomize trial project .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>B-RICH proposes pilot conduct randomize , single blind trial psychosocial intervention call `` Resiliency Class '' ( RC ) , provide depression education health promotion individual depressive symptom , train non-professionals offer class client receive service within diverse community setting ( e.g . health care clinic , church , community advocacy organization , social service agency ) . This class design therapy , rather design class inform cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) principle use address depressive symptom , improve mood , enhance resiliency face stress . The Resiliency Class manualized , CBT inform , seven session , psycho-educational intervention design deliver non-licensed teacher English Spanish address depressive symptom . Each session design 90-120 minute . Some goal RC : 1 ) provide psycho-education mood depressive symptom ; 2 ) provide education teacher health mental healthcare professional order improve access depression education offer approach improve depressive symptom ; 3 ) deliver class non-health care mental health care setting like church trust community location ( e.g . park recreation , primary care , social service agency , job retrain center , senior center ) instead `` therapy '' mental health setting individual would feel stigmatize ; 4 ) design manual usable class participant low literacy level English Spanish . The specific aim study : 1 . Pilot revise resiliency class intervention lead non-professionals 20 individual depressive symptom acceptability ; 2 . Revise resiliency class intervention base therapist 's experience pilot base feedback instructor pilot class participant ; 3 . Conduct randomize , single blind trial resiliency class ( study group ) versus case management social service assessment referral ( control group ) assess differential impact depressive symptom 400 study participant ( 200 arm study ) . There several step implementation B-RICH Study . Phase I 1 . We conduct pilot Resiliency Class Manual 2 instructor 20 individual divide two class fall 2012 . We screen 100 client Healthy African American Families II 1st African Presbyterian Church locate South Los Angeles detect approximately 70 potential participant depressive symptom use Patient Health Questionnaire 2 ( PHQ-2 ) . Participants endorse one item PHQ-2 , 18 year old , attend six 90-120 minute weekly Resiliency Classes , PHQ-8 score less 15 ( baseline interview ) eligible enroll Resiliency Class . These class deliver non-licensed , individual would equivalent community health worker . The class supervise Bowen Chung Jeanne Miranda . In phase study , pilot participant screener , baseline interview , follow-up interview feasibility ass amount time instrument require . 2 . Based class instructor 's feedback focus group pilot class study participant , PI , Co-PI , project manager re-revise manual final version utilize randomized trial resiliency class ( study group ) versus 2 case management call ( control group ) start January 2013 . Phase II 4 ) We conduct randomize trial Resiliency Class ( study group ) compare telephone case management social service assessment ( control group ) referral , ascertain differential impact depressive symptom January 2013 January 2014 . 4a ) We screen 1000 client partner agency potential study participation . Entry criterion include individual age 18 old endorse least one item Patient Health Questionnaire- 2 ( PHQ-2 ) , reliable way contact phone , able attend six , weekly session Resiliency Class . We estimate screen take place January 2013 June 2013 . 4b ) We plan enrol 400 client study . 4c ) Enrolled participant offer 45 minute baseline interview , collect data income , housing , functional status ( short form health survey - 12 item SF-12 ) ; medical condition ; mental health condition ; alcohol substance use ; use health mental health service ; knowledge , attitude , beliefs depression ; housing ; food insecurity ; cop strategy ; medication use ; satisfaction service ; health insurance status . We also collect contact information well information 3 people always know reach participant case direct contact information become invalid due disconnect phone change address . The baseline interview conduct time recruitment community study agency determine study eligibility phone either laptop computer use pencil paper study research assistant . We exclude enrolled participant PHQ-8 score 20 great ( severe depression ) refer local mental health agency area . 4d ) After enrol study complete baseline interview , participant either randomized control group ( two case management phone call ) study group ( seven session resiliency class ) . 4e ) Participants randomize control group receive two call case manager participate partner agency within first two month enrollment . These phone call ask study participant need referral local community healthcare , mental health care , substance use , job retraining , social service . If participant need referral , offer phone number address agency meet need . 4f ) Participants randomize study group offer enrollment Resiliency Class take place agency screen . 4g ) The study group stagger start time depend success participant enrollment . Each weekly , 90-120 minute class 10-12 study participant . Each participant Resiliency Class receive copy study manual initial class . In addition , class instructor provide light snack refreshments participant class . Class instructor combination study staff well staff partner agency . 4h ) Study Participants arm study receive 3-month , telephone follow-up interview assess measure baseline interview take 45 minute . 4i ) Research staff interview participant baseline follow-up interview blind intervention status study participant . 5 ) We conduct data analysis primary outcome measure , depressive symptom assess PHQ-8 . If Resiliency Class show great impact diminish depressive symptom , primary study outcome measure , case management phone call , contact participant case management arm study offer resiliency class participant free charge , well offer train staff agency interested implementing resiliency class intervention .

The Resiliency Class manual cover topic describe . 3 month follow-up interview Participants ask participate phone 45 minute follow-up interview 3 month enrol study . Data Analysis Phase I Quantitative analysis : Descriptive analysis conduct use screener measure . Univariate distribution examine identify outlier assess influence analysis . Issues consider include error data input , score source invalidity measurement . The data carefully inspect determine need scale transformation identify miss data , outlier , unusual feature . Assumptions normality also evaluate . Change score depressive symptom baseline post-class interview assess 95 % confidence interval . Due small sample size ( n=20 ) pilot phase , formal testing hypothesis conduct . Qualitative / Focus Group data : Qualitative material transcribe confidential transcriber de-identified confidential research assistant . The research assistant transform field code identifier analytic code identifier maintain code list secure file . Each dataset - discussion note , record feedback , interview response - enter file project Dedoose file ( www.dedoose.com ) , password-protected online site , use UCLA Dedoose program ( www.dedoose.com ) , software design specifically facilitate mixed-methods analysis . We use constructive ground theory analysis develop cod category base theme embed datasets fall within domain interest . ( 12 ) In particular , examine qualitative data theme describe : 1 ) experience like resiliency class ; 2 ) aspect resiliency class work improve mood ; 3 ) aspect resiliency class improve mood ; 4 ) felt need improve resiliency class manual ; 5 ) suggest improve resiliency class manual . Phase II Analysis Baseline 3 month follow-up interview data The main analysis intent-to-treat compare main effect CBT intervention versus case management call control . We hypothesize CBT class great impact reduce depressive symptom ( PHQ-8 ) control . We also examine intervention effect study measure ( e.g . MCS-12 , PCS12 , substance use , use health mental health service ) . We use ANCOVA model specifies outcome measure observe 3 month dependent variable ( e.g . PHQ-8 ) , treatment group independent variable , control baseline measure outcome covariate . For binary outcome ( e.g . substance use prior use antidepressant medication ) fit logistic regression model . General Analytic Strategies Univariate distribution examine identify outlier assess influence analysis . Issues consider include error data input , score source invalidity measurement . The data carefully inspect determine need scale transformation identify miss data , outlier , unusual feature . To improve precision estimate intervention effect , conduct series bivariate analyse identify potential covariates consider multiple regression model . Confounding assessed comparing unadjusted coefficient treatment condition adjust coefficient . Assumptions normality also evaluate . For example , explore various transformation ( e.g. , log ) number visit due often skewed distribution event count . Smearing estimate use , necessary , retransformation , apply separate factor intervention group ensure consistent estimate ( 13 ) In general , leave open possibility transform variable non-normal distribution ( 14 ) In certain case , outcome interest skew distribution , either many zero ( e.g . day work miss due illness ) and/or distribution observe value long tail ( e.g . service utilization ) . In case , draw upon statistical model develop type data , particular two-part model separately handle zero value skew distribution among non-zeros ( 13 ) . Tobit-type sample selection model ( 15 ) ; split-sample technique distinguish different functional form avoid overfitting ( 13 ) ; dynamic model , episode care analytic model , duration analysis , count model ( 16 ) . To improve precision estimate intervention effect , conduct series bivariate analyse identify potential covariates consider multiple regression model . Confounding assessed comparing unadjusted coefficient treatment condition adjust coefficient . We consider multiple imputation account unit level non-response ( 17 ) We inspect pattern miss data . If non-response appear non-ignorable employ statistical technique pattern mixture model relate method ; otherwise imputation strategy assume non-response ignorable ( i.e . miss random ) .
