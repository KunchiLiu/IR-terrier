	<brief_title>Antithrombin III Infants With Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) cardiovascular surgery initiate diffuse activation coagulation , inflammation fibrinolysis often deleterious effect patient outcome , include bleeding , transfusion , myocardial dysfunction , renal failure , pulmonary dysfunction , prolonged intubation , ICU hospital length stay , stroke neurocognitive dysfunction , mortality.Pediatric patient especially risk hematologic derangement relate CPB . Not infants child subject diffuse activation coagulation , inflammation , fibrinolysis adult , size , immaturity , circulatory abnormality secondary congenital heart disease increase risk loss hematologic homeostasis . Since infant 's blood volume much small prime CPB pump , hemodilution alone produce impaired hemostasis relate thrombocytopenia coagulation factor dilution The incidence complication variable depends diagnosis , operation , time CPB factor . Adequate anticoagulation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) essential preserve hemostatic system ensure hemostasis surgery . Heparin long mainstay anticoagulation CPB , due ease use , familiarity , reversibility . For heparin exert anticoagulant effect , must bind intrinsic cofactor , antithrombin III ( ATIII ) inhibit enzymes intrinsic final common coagulation pathway . It establish neonate significantly decrease level ATIII relative adult , relative deficiency continue least 6 month age . Children congenital heart disease decrease ATIII abnormality coagulation may contribute adverse outcome . Given ATIII deficiency , surprising heparin anticoagulation fully suppress coagulation CPB . Neonates anticoagulated CPB heparin ongoing activation humoral cellular coagulation associate activation inflammation fibrinolysis . Improved anticoagulation may reduce activation cascade improve outcome . In addition , infant high risk post cardiac surgery intervascular thrombosis . Baseline ATIII deficiency , consumption ATIII bypass may contribute postoperative prothrombotic state esulting often fatal complication . ATIII supplementation may decrease risk . ATIII available lyophilized product derive pooled human plasma . Treatment ATIII show improve anticoagulant effect heparin attenuate activation hemostasis inflammation adult CPB , decrease incidence thrombosis associate central venous cannulation child . The incidence central venous thrombosis infant undergo cardiac surgery report 5.8 - 22 % neonate , resultant mortality 20 % . The biologic half-life antithrombin healthy adult volunteer 2.5 - 3.8 day . Pharmacokinetic data neonate available , biologic activity certainly persist 2 high risk period : CPB , activation coagulation produce activation inflammation , cellular humoral , fibrinolysis . The early post-op period patient typically become hypercoagulable part stress response surgery . Hypercoagulability place patient high risk central line-associated thrombosis despite heparin-containing flush solution standard care . Ensuring near normal level antithrombin appear enhance ability flush solution inhibit thrombin generation catheter . ATIII use infant cardiac surgery prophylax central venous thrombosis , infant necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , treatment neonate congenital ATIII deficiency . Neonates appear respond expect ATIII supplementation , clinical efficacy central venous thrombosis NEC . No complication unique infant report publication . It reasonable expect ATIII would even beneficial infant le 6 month old .</detailed_description>
