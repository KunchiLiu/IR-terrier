	<brief_summary>This project clinical intervention trial determine role functional food , flaxseed , control blood glucose level people pre-diabetes . People pre-diabetes high blood glucose level since cell respond insulin . Over time , people pre-diabetes may progress type 2 diabetes increase risk heart kidney disease . Although long-term complication associate type 2 diabetes well-recognized , clinicians researcher realize long-term damage body , especially heart circulatory system , may already occur pre-diabetes . Consequently , clinician recognize glucose control , diet , exercise , necessary , medication , important people pre-diabetes people type 2 diabetes . Standard treatment pre-diabetes glucose control diet , exercise , drug . A possible treatment could add standard treatment intake flaxseed . Few study look effect flaxseed intake glucose control enrol people type 2 diabetes . To date , study report flaxseed 's affect control blood glucose people pre-diabetes . Therefore , research need determine flaxseed effective mean control glucose level people pre-diabetes . This study help determine whether eat modest amount flaxseed every day improve blood glucose insulin level overweight obese men postmenopausal woman pre-diabetes . It also show flaxseed intake reduce degree inflammation experiencing . If flaxseed consumption help control blood glucose level people pre-diabetes reduce degree inflammation experiencing , may help prevent delay progression type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-diabetes characterize hyperglycemia due ineffective insulin 'insulin resistance ' . Over time , people pre-diabetes may progress type 2 diabetes experience complication include cardiovascular peripheral vascular disease , hyperlipidemia , retinopathy , neuropathy , and/or nephropathy . Conventional intervention pre-diabetes glucose control diet , exercise , , necessary , medication . An efficient still uncommon adjunct intervention flaxseed supplementation . Since study examine affect flaxseed supplementation type 2 diabetes date , study report flaxseed 's influence glycemic control individual pre-diabetes , additional research warrant . The objective study determine affect consume flaxseed fast plasma glucose , insulin , fructosamine , adiponectin , fatty acid concentration , serum interleukin-6 ( hs-IL-6 ) , C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , urinary lignan excretion overweight obese men postmenopausal woman pre-diabetes . This research provide data strength relationship regular flaxseed intake biomarkers pre-diabetes glycemic control well adiponectin value marker inflammation .</detailed_description>
