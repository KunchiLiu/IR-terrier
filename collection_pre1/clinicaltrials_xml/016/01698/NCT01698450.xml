	<criteria>Men woman , 18 80 year , inclusive . Patients able willing give consent able attend study visit . A diagnosis MD , Essential Tremor ( ET ) , Idiopathic Parkinson 's disease primary Dystonia confirm clinical history examination movement disorder neurologist . A MD refractory adequate medical treatment , indication Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) would give , DBS perform medical comorbidities medical reason , patient clearly confirms write statement want undergo DBS personal reason ( PD : increase motor fluctuation albeit optimal medical treatment &amp; unbearable side effect medication ; ET : failure adequate tremor control Propranolol Primidone alone combination ; Dystonia : dystonia pain control oral medication ) . An adequate medication trial define therapeutic dose medication development side effect medication dose titrate . Either medial thalamic nuclei subthalamic pallidal area target ExAblate device . The target region must apparent MRI target perform either direct visualization measurement landmark , use `` Stereotactic Atlas Human Thalamus Basal Ganglia '' Anne Morel , 39 analogous first clinical FUS study patient chronic pain 33 . Able communicate sensation ExAblate MRgFUS treatment Stable dos medication 30 day prior study entry duration study . Significant disability due MD despite medical treatment ( speaking , feed liquid , bring liquid mouth , hygiene , dress , write , work , social activity ) Inclusion exclusion criterion agree upon two member medical team . Patients unstable cardiac status include : Unstable angina pectoris medication Patients document myocardial infarction within six month protocol entry Congestive heart failure require medication ( diuretic ) Patients antiarrhythmic drug Patients exhibit behavior ( ) consistent ethanol substance abuse define criterion outline DSMIV manifest one ( ) follow occur within 12 month period : Recurrent substance use result failure fulfill major role obligation work , school , home ( repeat absence poor work performance relate substance use ; substancerelated absence , suspension , expulsion school ; neglect child household ) . Recurrent substance use situation physically hazardous ( drive automobile operate machine impair substance use ) Recurrent substancerelated legal problem ( arrest substance relate disorderly conduct ) Continued substance use despite persistent recurrent social interpersonal problem cause exacerbated effect substance ( example , argument spouse consequence intoxication physical fight ) . Severe hypertension ( diastolic BP &gt; 100 medication ) Patients standard contraindication MR image nonMRI compatible implant metallic device include cardiac pacemaker , size limitation , etc . Known intolerance allergy MRI contrast agent ( e.g . Gadolinium ) include advanced kidney disease Severely impaired renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 45ml/min/ 1.73 m2 ) receive dialysis History abnormal bleeding and/or coagulopathy Receiving anticoagulant ( e.g . warfarin ) antiplatelet ( e.g . aspirin ) therapy within one week focus ultrasound procedure drug know increase risk hemorrhage ( e.g . Avastin ) within one month focus ultrasound procedure Active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection History intracranial hemorrhage Cerebrovascular disease ( multiple CVA CVA within 6 month ) Individuals able willing tolerate require prolonged stationary supine position treatment ( 4 hr total table time . ) Symptoms sign increase intracranial pressure ( e.g . headache , nausea , vomit , lethargy , papilledema ) Participation another clinical trial last 30 day Patients unable communicate investigator staff . Presence neurodegenerative disease like Parkinsonplus syndrome suspect neurological examination . These include : multisystem atrophy , progressive supranuclear palsy , dementia Lewy body , Alzheimer 's disease . Presence significant cognitive impairment determine score â‰¤ 24 Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) Compromised Immune System , include HIV positive serum status Known lifethreatening systemic disease Patients history seizure within past year Patients current prior history psychiatric illness exclude . Any presence history psychosis exclude . Patients significant mood disorder include depression exclude . For purpose study , consider significant mood disorder include patient : care psychiatrist 3 month take antidepressant medication great 6 month participate cognitivebehavioral therapy hospitalize treatment psychiatric illness receive transcranial magnetic stimulation receive electroconvulsive therapy Patients risk factor intraoperative postoperative bleeding ( platelet count le 100,000 per cubic millimeter , PT &gt; 14 , PTT &gt; 36 INR &gt; 1.3 ) document coagulopathy Patients brain tumor Any illness investigator 's opinion preclude participation study . Pregnancy lactation . Legal incapacity limit legal capacity .</criteria>
