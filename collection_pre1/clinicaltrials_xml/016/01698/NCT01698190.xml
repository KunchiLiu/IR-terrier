	<brief_title>Comparing Efficacy Endoscopic FNA v FNB Diagnosing Solid Gastrointestinal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When ultrasound use endoscopy , able visualize structure adjacent gastrointestinal tract close detail . Once mass visualized , use endoscopic ultrasound obtain tissue sample , pathologist examine order provide diagnosis . The conventional method obtain sample tissue endoscopic ultrasound call fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) . This involve insertion thin needle mass obtain small sample tissue pathologist examine . An alternative technique call fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) , involve insertion thin double-edged needle mass . This double-edged needle may potentially provide large sample tissue examine . Both technique commonly use , method equally safe . However , know one technique effective obtain sample tissue one techniques cost-effective . The purpose study determine one method efficacious cost-effective maintain diagnostic accuracy . The result study may alter way gastroenterologist obtain tissue sample endoscopic ultrasound , improve utility exam reduce unnecessary healthcare cost .</detailed_description>
