	<brief_summary>Our goal develop test new imaging technique help scientist study sarcopenia , process muscle become weak age . This imaging technique use Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) scanner measure ability muscle synthesize new protein . This ability build new muscle protein know Protein Synthesis Rate , think decline people age contribute muscle weaken . We research technique order develop tool help scientist physicians good understand muscle age change base stimulus , people eat high protein meal , exercise , take muscle-building drug . If research successful , provide new method scientist physicians test effectiveness new drug treatment muscle weakness . The study look healthy woman age 65 80 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On 2 separate visit , approximately 2 week visit . For visit volunteer require fast overnight ( food drink 10 hour prior arrival UCSF ( water OK ) ) . Visit 1 last approximately 5-6 hour . Visit 2 last approximately 8 hour . Each visit include general procedure , second visit vary slightly first ( describe ) . Including 10-hour overnight fast , visit entail roughly 15 hour continuous fast . After completion Visit 1 , snack drink available . For Visit 2 , volunteer protein drink roughly 4-5 hour visit , snack drink make available visit . After check , volunteer admit Imaging Suite . ) Catheters At begin visit , nurse place two flexible plastic catheter vein forearm . The catheter use collect blood sample measure change hormone amino acid level . They stay place 5 hour . One catheter also use infuse stable isotope . ii ) Stable Isotopes Stable isotopes amino acid naturally occur radioactive . Stable isotope similar regular amino acid , except slightly heavy form ( e.g. , `` heavy water '' stable isotope regular water ) . Stable isotope already present small quantity body . For 5 hour ( 6am - 11am ) , infuse stable isotope forearm vein increase naturally occur level 7-10 % . We later able measure change use highly sophisticated instrument . This allow u calculate rate body build muscle . iii ) Muscle Biopsies During visit , either 2 3 muscle biopsy sample take directly 2 small incision muscle thigh . On visit 1 , biopsy 2 time point visit 2 3 biopsy . The muscle biopsy procedure involve take small piece muscle tissue outside upper leg , 4-6 inch knee . The skin clean injected local anesthetic ( lidocaine , numbing medicine ) minimize pain . A small incision 1 cm make skin , needle 0.8 cm advance muscle . A piece muscle remove needle , skin close special medical glue suture , dress applied pressure biopsy site hold 10 minute stop bleeding might occur . The leg wrap ACE bandage prevent bleeding might occur . iv ) PET/CT Scan In biopsy , volunteer inject vein dose ( 12.5 millicurie ) L- [ methyl-11C ] methionine ( 11C-MET ) begin PET/CT image . Like stable isotope talk section `` ii '' , methionine naturally occur amino acid body . However , form methionine radioactive ( allow scanner detect presence body ) . The PET/CT take detailed picture flow 11C-MET muscle leg , provide information new muscle protein form . The volunteer need lie still table thigh inside machine . The table move machine make click whirring noise picture take . It take 90 minute gather scan data . v ) Ingestion protein drink Towards middle 2nd visit , volunteer ask drink approximately 8 fluid ounce drink contain 15 gram protein .</detailed_description>
