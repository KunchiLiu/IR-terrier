	<brief_summary>- Recipient desensitization protocols show enable successful living donor kidney transplantation across major ABO blood group barrier . For extracorporeal depletion circulate ABO antibody plasmapheresis ABO blood group specific immunoadsorption ( IA ) commonly use . - The efficiency semiselective non-antigen specific IA ABO-incompatible transplantation currently well establish . One potential drawback semiselective adsorbers could incomplete elimination IgM . - This randomize control crossover trial design clarify whether membrane filtration , adjunct semiselective IA , substantially enhance elimination IgM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>-Background study aim ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation offer possibility expand donor pool approximately 30 % . A variety different desensitization protocol show enable successful transplantation across major ABO barrier . In context , apheresis antibody depletion represent therapeutic mainstay . Two distinct technical principle , plasmapheresis ABO antigen-specific immunoadsorption , show allow excellent short- intermediate-term outcome . A particular technical advantage immunoadsorption may high selectivity regard antibody depletion , preclude major loss essential plasma constituent , include coagulation factor albumin , even treatment large plasma volume . Nevertheless , high treatment cost associate use ABO-specific column ( approve reuse ) may limit widespread clinical application . The efficiency semi-selective immunoadsorption technology regard ABO antibody depletion recipient desensitization less well establish . Theoretically , non-antigen-specific immunoglobulin depletion use protein A- , GAM peptide- , anti-Ig antibody-based adsorbers , could bring several advantage , low treatment cost associate use reusable twin column , potential simultaneously deplete antibody also HLA antigens . A critical drawback , however , may evident inefficiency regard ( ABO-specific ) IgM depletion , could pose considerable risk rejection . One strategy overcome drawback incomplete IgM depletion could use semiselective immunoadsorption combine antibody depletion technology . In context , one attractive option could enhancement antibody elimination connect membrane filter ( cascade filter ) immunoadsorption device . We propose conduct open randomize crossover study design see membrane filtration apply adjunct semiselective immunoadsorption ( GAM peptide adsorbers ) able enhance anti-ABO IgM elimination extent comparable ABO antigen-specific immunoadsorption . The result study , enrol 14 patient receive IA treatment clinical indication outside transplantation field , expect provide valuable basis use combine apheresis approach context ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation . -Who participate ? We plan recruit 14 adult patient ( &gt; 18 year , gender eligible , healthy volunteer accept ) subject regular routine IA therapy &gt; 1 weekly interval clinical indication relate ABO-incompatible transplantation ( antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder , systemic lupus erythematosus myasthenia gravis ) . -What study involve ? For membrane filtration , use membrane filter document capacity eliminate plasma IgM . The study conduct randomize crossover design ( AB vs. BA design ; stratify randomization ) . Treatment consist IA plus membrane filtration ( A ) IA sole treatment ( B ) , respectively . The primary study endpoint percent reduction ABO blood group specific IgM . The study power detect 30 % increase IgM elimination . -What possible benefit risk participate ? We expect direct benefit study subject . This pilot study , however , may provide valuable basis future trial evaluate clinical impact combine IA plus membrane filtration ABO incompatible transplantation . Potential risk include : adverse reaction upon exposure polysulfone ( rash , pruritus , fever ) , reduction fibrinogen level eventually transient increase risk bleeding .</detailed_description>
