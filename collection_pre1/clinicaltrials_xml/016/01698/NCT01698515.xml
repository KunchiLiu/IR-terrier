	<detailed_description>20 subject RA , start TNF inhibitor base decision treat rheumatologist , recruit exist clinic population receive ongoing clinical care Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center . No patient outside clinic recruit . No medication supply study . Study duration number visit : Patients follow 14-16 week initiation TNF inhibitor . Each patient see 4 visit : screen visit , baseline visit , follow visit 6-8 week TNF inhibitor initiation , final visit week 14-16 TNF inhibitor initiation . At visit procedure note perform . Should patient discontinue TNF inhibitor reason , final assessment time stop request . Rheumatology Assessments : Subjects complete standard clinical assessment questionnaire age , race , demographic status , past medical surgical history , co-morbid disease , sign symptom arthritis , . Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire ( MD-HAQ ) short form survey ( SF ) -36 . Baseline joint count swell , tender , deform operated joint record . A Schirmer test measure conjunctival tear production perform . Oral Health Periodontal Evaluation : Subjects comprehensive oral health periodontal evaluation . Subjects complete standardized oral health questionnaire assess dental health ( include caries , tooth loss , periodontitis , dry mouth , TMD ) dental hygiene practice , prior dental procedure , , smoking , access dental care . Subjects undergo comprehensive dental evaluation include oral mucosal assessment , include plaque , gingivitis , periodontal index record 6 site per tooth , well evaluation xerostomia temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) function . Gingival crevicular fluid collect paper point place periodontal sulcus 2 severely affected teeth 2 site least amount periodontal inflammation . Unstimulated saliva collect 5 minute follow GCF collection . Laboratory Assessments : At visit investigator obtain blood assay C-reactive protein ( CRP ) biomarkers . These include evaluation panel inflammatory cytokine test blood , saliva , GCF , determine may change time response TNF antagonist therapy RA . . Withdrawal Criteria : Patients may withdraw consent time longer participate oral examination assessment . Patients discontinue TNF agent reason tolerability lack efficacy ask return study termination visit follow oral examination .</detailed_description>
