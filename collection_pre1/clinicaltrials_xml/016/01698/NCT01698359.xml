	<brief_summary>Muscle-invasive bladder cancer affect 3,000 new patient UK year radiotherapy comprise key part treatment pathway many . Bladder radiotherapy UK involve delivery radiation entire bladder volume aim deliver high dose bladder spar nearby healthy organ ( e.g . bowel ) . Unfortunately , large variation bladder shape volume observe throughout treatment compromise probability positive outcome patient , either increase risk side-effects reduce likelihood adequately treat disease . In recent year , implementation 'adaptive ' bladder radiotherapy strategy increase . These technique allow modification treatment base observed variation bladder shape volume . However , strategy often rely daily X-ray imaging patient prior treatment , time-consuming associate small risk induce cancer patient . This study evaluate potential commercially available ultrasound probe use alternative X-ray scanning treatment patient . The study also aim compare likelihood reduce side-effects successfully treat disease different adaptive strategy use around world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Ultrasound Probe Use Bladder Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All experiment data analysis perform Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Radiotherapy department respectively , Queen Elizabeth Hospital . Five volunteer recruit study . They require follow document drinking protocol prior three scan session . The drinking protocol specific study intend use patient . To address primary endpoint study ( i.e . precision ultrasound probe measurement bladder volume ) , measurement wide range bladder volume require . In order address aim make efficient use limit available MRI scanner time , drink protocol design volunteer begin scan session empty bladder finish full bladder . To end , volunteer require void bladder upon arrival consume 500ml water immediately prior start scan session . Each volunteer position scanner couch accord protocol use patient alternate MRI ultrasound scan acquire . Given time require scan anticipated five MRI scan fifteen ultrasound scan ( three scan time reduce noise result , i.e . ultimately give five ultrasound bladder volume measurement ) acquire session . Each volunteer ask attend three session course number week repeatability bladder fill pattern determine . Data processing analysis The volume measurement ultrasound probe record MRI image export Radiotherapy department bladder volume determine . The precise timing scan acquisition record image session . Bladder volume measure ultrasound probe , read instantly , record session . To evaluate primary endpoint , precision accuracy ultrasound probe quantify compare measure value expect MRI volume . Each volume measurement MRI scan checked second observer minimise associate researcher error . To evaluate secondary endpoint , image protocol describe provide 15 MRI image volunteer use inform comparison different adaptive strategy . However , since patient always ask empty bladder prior radiotherapy treatment ( order minimise volume receive radiation ) , deliberately wide-ranging bladder volume measure study representative would observe clinical practice . To address problem , suitable dataset quantifies distribution bladder volume encounter typical patient cohort use ( Christie dataset , permission obtained.Software write randomly assign bladder volume day volunteer 's 'treatment ' . The MRI scan volunteer closely correspond select volume assign day 's treatment . This repeat full 20 day treatment importance MRI scan factor result analysis accordingly . The treatment planning system within Radiotherapy department use MRI scan simulate range different 'treatments ' accord different adaptive bladder radiotherapy strategy compare . The different strategy summarise : - Conventional strategy : This current standard treatment , patient plan prepare base initial CT scan patient empty bladder account make subsequent daily variation bladder shape volume . - Plan-of-the-day strategy : Based initial CT scan patient empty bladder , three different treatment plan create base assumption bladder might expand . These intended simulate empty , partially full full bladder . The patient scan treatment day appropriate plan select treatment . - Dynamic strategy : Three different treatment plan create base series initial CT scan patient empty , partially full full bladder . These would expect directly represent empty , partially full full bladder individual patient . The patient scan treatment day appropriate plan select treatment . - Composite strategy : The patient CT scan empty bladder treat accord Conventional strategy first 7 day treatment daily imaging . The first 5 daily scan patient use generate plan base small , partially full full bladder . From 8th day treatment daily image use select plan appropriate treatment . Data processing MRI scan carry retrospectively . The MRI scan anonymised export Radiotherapy department . The data use ( ) acquire bladder volume information compare acquire ultrasound probe ( ii ) prepare evaluate radiotherapy treatment simulation investigate benefit different adaptive bladder radiotherapy strategy Comparison different adaptive technique focus much radiation receive bowel extent radiation miss disease day treatment .</detailed_description>
