	<brief_summary>Impaired stand balance , fatigue abnormal eye movement common problem person MS . These complaint relate advanced disability decrease quality life person MS . Researchers University Colorado Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center ( RMMSC ) Anschutz Medical Campus recently complete publish research study show exercise program consist balance eye movement training , refer vestibular rehabilitation program , effective improve self-reported fatigue stand balance person MS . This initial study first proven type exercise program able improve potentially devastating complaint . The investigator initial study partner well-established researcher University Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center ( RMMSC ) Anschutz Medical Campus advance knowledge effect vestibular rehabilitation person MS . Using finding initial study , investigator propose conduct large study specifically identify person MS brain lesion involvement area control balance eye movement . Primarily , current study determine individual involvement area brain improve balance fatigue compare follow participation vestibular rehabilitation program . Additionally , investigator test study participant abnormal eye movement control , improve eye movement control follow train program . For person MS , impair eye movement lead considerable decline health status , illustrate importance research plan study important factor . The investigator believe great improvement balance fatigue possible longer treatment , participant brain lesion involvement area help control balance eye movement benefit great . This information important determine likely benefit vestibular rehabilitation program . Additionally , researcher able measure change eye movement control , provide valuable insight reason program 's effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses Specific Aims Specific Aims Impaired balance ( upright postural control ) , visual instability fatigue common complaint person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , often lead advanced disability lower quality life . MS affect structure throughout central nervous system ( CNS ) , frequent involvement infratentorial structure include brainstem cerebellum.1-4 These structure play integral role process maintain balance.5-8 Indeed , person MS , involvement structure strongly link impaired balance , often lead falls.9,10 To knowledge , study establish effective treatment improve balance specifically person MS involvement brainstem/cerebellar structure . Our previous study11 provide evidence vestibular rehabilitation , exercise program involve balance eye movement training , greatly improve balance fatigue patient MS primary complaint area . Brainstem cerebellar dysfunction strongly associate impaired balance.9,10 Analysis previous study indicate great improvement balance vestibular rehabilitation likely person MS brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement . Neural plasticity report person MS follow task-specific training.12-15 We conceptualize vestibular rehabilitation target CNS , specifically brainstem cerebellum , provide necessary task-specific stimulus effective neural reorganization , improve central sensory integration result improve balance visual stability . Functioning impaired balance visual stability highly fatigue . As , anticipate intervention approach also improve fatigue . We propose 16-wk , two-group , stratified-blocked randomize controlled trial . Our primary aim determine vestibular rehabilitation person MS effective improve balance brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement compare person MS . In addition , eye movement exercise important part propose vestibular rehabilitation program , determine significant change visual stability person MS present abnormal eye movement possible following participation program . Lastly , expand knowledge benefit vestibular rehabilitation fatigue Primary Aim : To compare change balance base two stratum : participant brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement without , compare change two study group : Experimental group ( vestibular rehabilitation program ) Wait-listed Control group ( wait-listed vestibular rehabilitation instruction ) . Hypothesis ( H1 ) : 1 ) Participants Experimental group brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement great improvement balance compare without brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement ; 2 ) The Experimental group great improvement balance compare Wait-listed Control group . Secondary Aim 1 : To identify change eye movement dysfunction participant Experimental group eye movement dysfunction baseline , compare change two study group . Hypothesis ( H2 ) : 1 ) Participants Experimental group present impair eye movement baseline improve significantly visual stability follow performance vestibular rehabilitation program compare baseline value ; 2 ) Participants Experimental group present impair eye movement improve significantly visual stability compare participant Wait-listed Control group also present impaired eye movement . Secondary Aim 2 : To compare change self-reported fatigue base brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement stratum two study group . Hypothesis ( H3 ) : 1 ) Participants Experimental group brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement great improvement fatigue compare without brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement ; 2 ) The Experimental group great improvement fatigue compare Wait-listed Control group . An overarch objective research set stage future investigation underlie mechanism responsible benefit find vestibular rehabilitation . CNS involvement neural plasticity serve primary target future investigation .</detailed_description>
