	<brief_title>Prescribe Exercise Prevention Falls Fractures : A Family Health Team Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls fracture together represent one lead cause morbidity mortality within old adult population . Additionally , consequence fall fracture contribute substantial cost health care system negatively impact quality life individual . Given Canada 's age population increase unprecedented rate , imperative prevention management fall fracture make priority . One population particularly vulnerable fall fracture diagnose osteoporosis low bone mass . It estimate approximately 10 billion individual diagnose osteoporosis another 34 million risk low bone mass . Osteoporosis-related fragility fracture common consequence osteoporosis result increase morbidity mortality . Approximately 50 % suffer hip fracture regain previous level mobility functional independence thus result many individual rely use assistive device . Currently emphasis osteoporosis treatment management prevent occurrence fragility fracture subsequent side effect accompany . A recent meta-analysis show exercise assist prevention maintenance bone loss postmenopausal woman . Other benefit exercise increase muscle strength balance strongly establish indirectly prevent fracture reduction fall risk . Those high risk fall fracture require patient specific assessment individualize prescription typically available within community low cost . Further , may difficult engage individual spent life sedentary state experience barrier lack transportation , lack knowledge appropriate type exercise initiate exercise daily live . Furthermore , many exercise may appropriate individual depend location fracture level physical function . It emphasize focus individualized exercise program , would encompass individual need recognize individual limitation . Family physician may ideal position deliver exercise prescription patient , often first point contact health care system . However , number problem cite use family physician implement delivery exercise prescription . Among barrier , lack time lack knowledge identify problematic . An interdisciplinary family health team model care become increasingly important regard treatment chronic condition osteoporosis . Family health team provide ideal form care team member work together deliver program enhance adherence . A limitation many exercise intervention fail include behavior change component may important factor consider attempt facilitate adherence exercise program . The Health Action Process Approach model behavior change widely use variety health context include limited physical activity . The rationale selection model incorporate key principle behavior change model . Furthermore , model cite valid reliable tool predict physical activity level old adult . This project outline exercise intervention multidisciplinary nature tailor individual employed within interdisciplinary family health team . Additionally , behavior change component build intervention key principle action plan cop plan base HAPA model facilitate uptake physical activity vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
