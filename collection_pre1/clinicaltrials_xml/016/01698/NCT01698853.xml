	<brief_summary>Femoro-femoral cardiopulmonary bypass retrograde perfusion need totally thoracoscopic cardiac surgery . one major complication retrograde perfusion organ hypoperfusion . Arterial blood gas analysis help detect hypoperfusion hypoxia retrograde perfusion . However , whether arterial oxygenation status different part body condition retrograde perfusion study . The present study aim determine difference arterial oxygenation peripheral arterial aortic root period retrograde perfusion.In addition , impact artificial ventilation difference arterial oxygenation also investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient include assigned two different group accord surgical approach , one group name `` NP '' normal perfusion , name `` RP '' retrograde perfusion . For patient , obtain 0.5ml blood peripheral arterial aortic root blood gas analysis specific time point . We focus difference arterial oxygenation peripheral arterial aortic root group.At time , analyse impact artificial ventilation .</detailed_description>
