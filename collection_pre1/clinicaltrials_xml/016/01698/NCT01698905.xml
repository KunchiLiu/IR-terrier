	<brief_summary>A clinical research study find safe stop drug nilotinib ( Tasigna ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) patient . Patients start treatment imatinib ( Gleevec ) first diagnose CML , switch nilotinib ( Tasigna ) least 2 year combined time imatinib ( Gleevec ) nilotinib ( Tasigna ) least 3 year small amount leukemia cell remain nilotinib ( Tasigna ) treatment qualify study .</brief_summary>

Patient receive minimum 3 year tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment ( first imatinib ( &gt; 4 week ) switch nilotinib ) since initial diagnosis 5 . Patient least 2 year nilotinib treatment prior study entry . 6 . Patient achieve MR4.5 ( local laboratory assessment ) nilotinib treatment , determine Novartis designated central PCR lab assessment screen 7 . Adequate end organ function define : Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN except ) patient document Gilbert 's syndrome bilirubin value allow ii ) patient asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia ( liver transaminase alkaline phosphatase within normal range ) SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 3 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) Serum lipase ≤ 2 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN 8 . Patients must follow electrolyte value ≥ LLN ( low limit normal ) limit correct within normal limit supplement prior first dose study medication : Potassium Magnesium Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) 9 . Patients must normal marrow function define : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL 10 . Written inform consent obtain prior screen procedure 1 . Prior AP , BC allotransplant 2 . Patient document MR4.5 time switch imatinib nilotinib 3 . Patients known atypical transcript 4 . CML treatment resistant mutation ( ) ( T315I , E255K/V , Y253H , F359C/V ) detect test do past ( requirement perform mutation test study entry do past ) 5 . Dose reduction due neutropenia thrombocytopenia past 6 month 6 . Patient ever attempt permanently discontinue imatinib nilotinib treatment 7 . Known impaired cardiac function include one following : Inability determine QT interval ECG Complete leave bundle branch block Long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome History presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias Clinically significant rest bradycardia QTcF &gt; 480 msec History clinical sign myocardial infarction within 1 year prior study entry History unstable angina within 1 year prior study entry Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . uncontrolled congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension ) 8 . Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease opinion investigator could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes ( define HbA1c &gt; 9 % ) , uncontrolled infection ) 9 . History acute pancreatitis within 1 year prior study entry past medical history chronic pancreatitis 10 . Known presence significant congenital acquire bleed disorder unrelated cancer 11 . History active malignancy within 5 year prior study entry exception previous concomitant basal cell skin cancer , previous cervical carcinoma situ treat curatively 12 . Patients recover prior surgery 13 . Treatment investigational agent ( define use accordance approve indication ) within 4 week Day 1 14 . Patients actively receive therapy strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and/or inducer , treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior study entry . See Appendix 14.1 list medication . This list may comprehensive . 15 . Patients actively receive therapy herbal medicine strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and/or inducer , treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior study entry . These herbal medicine may include Echinacea , ( include E. purpurea , E. angustifolia E. pallida ) , Piperine , Artemisinin , St. John 's Wort , Ginkgo . 16 . Patients currently receive treatment medication potential prolong QT interval treatment either safely discontinue switch different medication prior study entry . ( Please see www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/printabledruglist.cfm list agent prolong QT interval . ) 17 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection , gastric bypass surgery ) 18 .

Acceptable form highly effective contraception method include : . Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception male/female sterilization define : Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm document follow hormone level assessment Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female patient study , study participation assumes vasectomized male partner sole partner patient b . A combination two follow ( i+ii i+iii ii+iii ) : ) Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository ii ) Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception iii ) Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS )</criteria>
