	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize trial compare high level dairy intake compare low level dairy intake . Participants 20 boy girl , age 10-13 , overweight ( &gt; 85 % ) currently consume 1 few serving dairy per day . Each participant randomize either high low level dairy intake . A baseline calorimeter stay determine 24-hour energy need . Participants receive diet randomize receive 6 day second calorimeter stay . During 2nd stay , participant continue receive diet randomize receive achieve 300 kcal energy deficit physical activity . The investigator hypothesize child receive 300 kcal energy deficit energy expenditure exercise receive 3 4 serving dairy product show great increase fat oxidation compare child receive 300 kcal energy expenditure exercise receive 1 few serving dairy product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study objective conduct randomize clinical trial compare enhanced level dairy consumption low level dairy consumption energy deficit result 300 kcal exercise . Participants 24 sedentary overweight boy , 13-15 year age girl , 12 14 year age , consume 1 few serving dairy le 600 mg calcium per day baseline . Participants randomly assign either high low dairy 6 day cross opposite treatment subsequent 2 week wash . The investigator provide meal snack participant high low dairy condition . During wash period , participant instruct consume normal diet assess baseline consist 1 few serving dairy le 600 mg calcium . Participants stay calorimeter baseline , day 7 , day 28 ( end study ) , crossover . The calorimeter measure substrate oxidation condition 300 kcal energy deficit due exercise .</detailed_description>
