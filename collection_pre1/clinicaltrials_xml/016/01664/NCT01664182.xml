	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well trebananib without bevacizumab , pazopanib hydrochloride , sorafenib tosylate , sunitinib malate work treat patient kidney cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . Trebananib may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Bevacizumab , pazopanib hydrochloride , sorafenib tosylate , sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give trebananib without bevacizumab , pazopanib hydrochloride , sorafenib tosylate , sunitinib malate effective treat kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trebananib With Without Bevacizumab , Pazopanib Hydrochloride , Sorafenib Tosylate , Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) trebananib ( AMG 386 ) alone combination continuation previously administer bevacizumab , pazopanib hydrochloride ( pazopanib ) , sorafenib tosylate ( sorafenib ) , sunitinib malate ( sunitinib ) advance renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival arm . II . To evaluate tolerance toxicity AMG 386 alone combination continuation prior VEGF target agent . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association pretreatment tumor gene expression level response AMG 386 combination continuation prior VEGF target agent . II . To evaluate association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) angiogenic gene response AMG 386 combination continuation prior VEGF target agent . III . To compare change circulate angiogenic factor patient treat AMG 386 monotherapy treat AMG 386 combination VEGF-targeted therapy . IV . To compare expression angiogenic gene archival tumor specimen expression biopsy specimen obtain progression anti-VEGF therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive trebananib intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive trebananib Arm I either bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 ; pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-42 ; sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-42 ; sunitinib malate PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-8 week .</detailed_description>
