	<brief_summary>Intrauterine device ( IUD ) placement painful patient procedure . Fear pain IUD insertion barrier obtain highly effective long act reversible contraception . Currently proven effective method reduction pain placement modern IUDs ( Mirena IUD Paragard IUD ) . Ketorolac study regard decrease pain IUD insertion although used provider purpose . It strong NSAID indicate treatment moderate acute pain . In intramuscular form analgesia onset action 30min , thus may plausible option pain management office setting compare oral NSAIDs , long time onset analgesia proven effective reduce pain associate IUD placement . The primary aim study determine whether ketorolac ( Toradol ) decrease pain associated intrauterine device placement compare placebo . We hypothesize administration ketorolac 30mg intramuscularly least 30 minute prior IUD insertion decrease pain score least 20mm visual analog scale various time point IUD insertion compare placebo normal saline injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Control Intrauterine Device Placement : A Trial Ketorolac Prior Intrauterine Device Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern intrauterine device highly effective long act reversible form contraception . The Mirena IUD 99.8 % effective Paragard copper IUD 99.2 % effective preventing pregnancy ( Zieman 2010 ) . Fear intrauterine device placement barrier obtain highly effective form birth control . The current standard care pain management IUD placement medication , randomize control trial publish date limit data regard use medication decrease pain . There one trial suggest use naproxen 1 % lidocaine paracervical block compare paracervical block alone may decrease pain IUD placement primarily nulliparous patient . However , study much wider longer available Dalkon Shield IUD . In addition , study show significant decrease pain score IUD placement ( Massey 1974 ) . Studies evaluate effectiveness motrin misoprostol show significant decrease pain score IUD insertion , although majority participant study multiparous ( Jensen 1998 , Hubacher 2006 , Saav 1997 ) . There suggestion 2 % lidocaine gel one minute prior IUD insertion may decrease pain , although study poorly design ( Oloto 1996 ) . There study publish date regard use ketorolac decrease pain IUD placement . Ketorolac acetic acid NSAID reversibly inhibit COX 1 2 , lead decrease formation prostaglandin precursor , indicate use moderate acute pain short term set . Its administration office setting may good option provider since intramuscular administration lead analgesia begin 30 minute , maximal effect 1 2 hour administration , duration analgesia approximately 4 6 hour 30mg intramuscular injection . Although standard care regard pain medication administration prior IUD placement , provider UCSD often suggest certain option . These include ibuprofen least one hour prior procedure , ibuprofen take within hour procedure , ketorolac injection least 15-30 minute prior procedure . It would beneficial provider evidence base option patient .</detailed_description>
