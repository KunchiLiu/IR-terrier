	<brief_title>Roflumilast Plus Alogliptin Proof-of-Mechanism Study Type2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate antiglycemic efficacy safety roflumilast + alogliptin compare alogliptin alone roflumilast alone ; also include open-label exenatide treatment arm control . The antiglycemic efficacy combination evaluate measurement postprandial active GLP-1 level , ß cell secretion activity ( via measurement C-peptide insulin level ) , appetite sensation ( assessed VAS ) glycemic control assess continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) .</detailed_description>
