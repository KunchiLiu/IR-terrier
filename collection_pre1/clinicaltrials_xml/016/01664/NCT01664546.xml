	<brief_title>Study Best Blastocyst Post Transfer aCGH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis preimplantational aneuploidy screening could improve pregnancy rate post procedure IVF/ICSI base two main reason : 1 ) 50 % chromosomal risk exist fertilization reproductive age , increase age 2 ) evidence chromosome abnormality spontaneously abort . Therefore , encourage establishment pregnancy , majority reproductive center transfer least two embryo . However attitude risky increase multiple pregnancy medical social disadvantage . Embryo selection base morphology degree development sufficient identify chromosomally normal embryo . The experience gain last 10 year PGS use FISH technique conclude clinical value even select population advance maternal age , repeat failure IVF/ICSI , recurrent abortion severe male factor . The three main argument : 1 ) limitation technique enumerate 24 chromosome , 2 ) reduce ability implantation biopsy perform third day vitro development 3 ) discarding embryo could self-corrected . The possibility amplify entire genome one two cell embryo permit use methodology screen 24 chromosome , , comparative genomic hybridization-performed metaphase plate ( mCGH ) slide thousand probe correspond human chromosome segment clone bacteria ( BAC array ) array single nucleotide polymorphism ( aSNP ) , besides classic real time qPCR . Other important development include culture pre-embryos blastocyst stage . This allow cell obtain study hatch trophectoderm , efficiency achieve vitrification allow transfer another cycle , unstimulated , good result fresh transfer . These last two fact important , first practical point view study perform embryo reach high degree development vitro , second receptivity endometrium well unstimulated cycle , also avoid potential iatrogenic effect drug use ovarian stimulation cycle . On last point , interest finding report last Australian Register risk birth defect reproductive technology , show rate abnormality thaw embryos different bear without reproductive technology , rate birth anomaly fresh embryo transfer great without assist reproductive technology . Furthermore , non embryo transfer fresh cycle permit time study implementation different genetic methodology previously could perform due time constraint . This new option allow u organize work well obviously gain great efficiency . This possibility important geneticist willing work every day necessary . Considering mentioned argument , propose perform couple require IVF/ICSI embryo biopsy blastocyst stage , immediate vitrification thereof , transfer best blastocyst , evaluated expansion quality trophectoderm inner cell mass , subsequent cycle physiologically prim endometrium . The molecular karyotype ( aCGH ) perform embryo transfer . The result karyotype embryo transfer determined patient take pregnancy test . In way , know proportion type chromosomal abnormality three group patient blastocyst transfer : ) could get pregnant , b ) get pregnant miscarry c ) successfully give birth . We suggest trial design allow clarification biological behavior preimplantational aneuploidy ass whether really clinical value . If preimplantation chromosome abnormality clinical value , proportion type aneuploidy different three group patient mention . We offer free pregnant woman amniocentesis confirm whether fetal karyotype consistent trophectoderm , especially aneuploid blastocyst transfer . Those refuse assess prenatally , test make time delivery via umbilical cord blood . In contrast , patient miscarry , depend gestational age , offer study abort product obtain curettage , chorionic villus puncture , amniocentesis fetal biopsy . The patient achieve pregnancy lose spontaneously due chromosome abnormality , benefit subsequent transfer remain vitrified euploid embryo obtain new stimulation cycle perform aCGH transfer . Patients achieve `` take home baby '' decide child may also take advantage remain euploid devitrified blastocyst . We prefer clinical trial transfer stimulate cycle pilot study , unstimulated cycle transfer , yield well result term pregnancy rate compare historical data PGD fresh transfer . Other recent study devitrify blastocyst transfer natural cycle endometrium physiologically prepare also show good pregnancy rate besides , less iatrogenic fresh embryo transfer . The hypothesis embryonic aneuploidy screen select best embryo correct support publish data cytogenetic study gametes and/or human embryo . When couple produce enough blastocyst good quality , selection euploid blastocyst transfer beneficial , couple produce one aneuploid blastocyst sure discard able demonstrate behavior aneuploidy preimplantational period , especially chromosomal abnormality find part pathology newborn , otherwise would eliminate last chance couple become genetic parent . We believe demonstrate , clinical value embryo molecular karyotype application , could beneficial achieve well ongoing pregnancy rate select patient group woman advance reproductive age , recurrent abortion severe male factor .</detailed_description>
