	<brief_title>High-Dose Stereotactic Radiation Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess treatment related gastrointestinal ( GI ) genitourinary ( GU ) toxicity patient undergo SBRT localize prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Follow quality life SBRT use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) American Urological Association ( AUA ) score . II . Assess biochemical control high-dose SBRT . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 5 fraction prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy 10-12 day least 40 hour fraction absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1.5 , 4 , 8 , 12 month , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
