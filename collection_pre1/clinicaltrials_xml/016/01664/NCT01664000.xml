	<brief_summary>In laboratory , Kevetrin activate p53 , tumor suppressor protein important role protect body . p53 function activate protein repair DNA kill cell genetic mutation cancer . Research experiment show cancer cell treat Kevetrin , activate p53 induced p21 , protein inhibits cancer cell growth . p53 also induce PUMA ( p53 up-regulated modulator apoptosis ) , protein cause tumor cell death . Because activity , slow cancer cell growth cause cancer cell death , Kevetrin may help treat tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety , Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Study Kevetrin Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kevetrin find effective pre-clinical study human xenograft tumor model reasonably well-tolerated therapeutic dos non-clinical animal study . Kevetrin also effective multi-drug resistant tumor model ; therefore , Kevetrin potential treat tumor become resistant standard chemotherapy . This trial determine tolerance human , possibly , efficacy Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation , safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic study Kevetrin , adult patient solid tumor . The primary objective follow : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Kevetrin . - To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) Kevetrin . - To establish safe dose level Kevetrin use future study . The secondary objective determine follow : - The pharmacokinetics Kevetrin human . - Observe evidence antitumor activity follow administration Kevetrin . - If Kevetrin induces change biomarker p21 peripheral blood lymphocyte . - If pharmacodynamic relationship plasma concentration Kevetrin clinical cellular effect . During 4 week cycle , patient receive three weekly dos Kevetrin give 1 hour intravenous infusion follow 1 week off-treatment period . Following dose , patient monitor . If patient acceptable safety tolerance , Kevetrin give weekly total 3 week . During cycle patient evaluate safety , tolerance , Dose-Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) occur cycle .</detailed_description>
