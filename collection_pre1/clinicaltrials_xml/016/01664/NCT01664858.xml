	<detailed_description>The study randomize control trial non-invasive imaging determine diagnosis management patient present suspect stable angina . Despite widespread availability non-invasive image guideline-enshrined use optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) , patient suspect coronary heart disease ( CHD ) often end invasive coronary angiography early disease course . Currently &gt; 50 % elective invasive coronary angiogram perform UK US lead revascularisation procedure ( data 2008-09 UK Hospital Episode Statistics ; American College Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( Patel MR , et al. , N Engl J Med 2010 ; 362:886-95 ) ) . The UK NICE guideline management chest pain recent onset ( CG95 ; 2010 ) could increase proportion even . This inefficient patient also healthcare resource . More widespread use non-invasive functional imaging could reduce rate unnecessary angiography . We show CE-MARC study ( Lancet 2012 ) cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) 1.5Tesla high diagnostic accuracy detection CHD single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . CE-MARC 2 three-way randomise control trial patient management 1200 patient know suspected CHD , compare 3Tesla CMR SPECT-guided care NICE guidelines-based management . The primary endpoint reduction unnecessary invasive angiography ( defined invasive FFR ) 12 month - identify expert patient important 'patient focus ' clinical outcome measure . The secondary objective include : 1 ) assessment safety CMR-guided management strategy 2 ) cost effectiveness analysis strategy .</detailed_description>
