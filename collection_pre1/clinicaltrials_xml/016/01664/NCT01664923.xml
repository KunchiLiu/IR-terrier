	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Enzalutamide Versus Bicalutamide Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , efficacy safety study enzalutamide ( 160 mg/day ) vs. bicalutamide ( 50 mg/day ) patient recurrent prostate cancer serologic and/or radiographic disease progression despite primary androgen deprivation therapy . Throughout study , safety tolerability assess record adverse event , monitor vital sign , physical examination , safety laboratory evaluation . Following study unblinding , study patient receive enzalutamide bicalutamide time unblinding qualify patient randomize bicalutamide discontinue prior unblinding offer opportunity receive open label enzalutamide treatment .</detailed_description>
