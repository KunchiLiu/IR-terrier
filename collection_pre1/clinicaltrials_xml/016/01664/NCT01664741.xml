	<brief_summary>The propose research provide significant new gender-specific information scientific clinical relevance function mu-opioid system nicotine dependence therapeutic effectiveness nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . The study help explain difference prevalence smoke men woman , sex-specific difference nicotine crave withdrawal well poorer therapeutic response NRT . This work may pave way design improved pharmacotherapies effectively target endogenous opioid system treatment nicotine dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While smoke prevalence decline men woman last two decade , rate among woman show much shallow decrease , recent year , prevalence cigarette initiation high girl boy . Smoking among woman child-bearing age significant negative health consequence mother child , increase fetal infant morbidity mortality . Women less likely initiate quit attempt likely relapse quit . Nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , still widely use smoking treatment intervention United States , less effective woman compare men , woman report less crave reduction NRT . The endogenous opioid system involve smoke initiation , nicotine crave reward well nicotine withdrawal symptom . Interestingly , research suggest sexual dimorphic feature endogenous mu-opioid system may part explain gender difference nicotine effect . To well understand role mu-opioid system poor NRT response woman , proposal examine NRT effect mu opioid receptor bind potential ( MOR BP ) female compare male smoker active versus placebo NRT . Specifically , nicotine dependent woman men active smoking status undergo PET image MOR BP measurement use 11C-carfentanil . Following baseline PET measurement active smoking ( scan 1 ) , smoker randomize active placebo nicotine replacement therapy ( ( A-NRT P-NRT ) ; 72 hour later , second scan obtain . As reference group , demographically-matched woman men never smoke undergo two scan well . Behavioral measurement nicotine reward , crave withdrawal obtain repeatedly across protocol . The propose research provide significant new , gender-specific information scientific clinical relevance function mu-opioid system nicotine dependence therapeutic effectiveness nicotine replacement therapy .</detailed_description>
