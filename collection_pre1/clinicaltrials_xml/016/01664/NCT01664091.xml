	<brief_summary>This research study do carefully evaluate effect give radiation therapy temporary breast reconstruction . The investigator want see type reconstruction combine radiation look well ( final reconstruction complete ) reduce risk participant develop complication sometimes occur kind reconstruction procedure . The investigator also want know easier give radiation type reconstruction kinds reconstruction procedure . The reconstruction procedure involve temporary use tissue expander acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- ADMs use combination tissue expander radiotherapy study formally term ability avoid complication sometimes see method reconstruction improve delivery radiation . The difference study study research team analyze record participate see easy give radiation , good cosmetic outcome reconstruction , , complication occur . - A minimum 6 week surgery start radiation therapy require allow adequate healing . Often interval long , many patient receive chemotherapy interim . There maximum time surgery radiation . - Around time radiation planning , radiation oncologist plastic surgeon agree upon much deflation tissue expander require permit simulation radiation therapy . - Radiation therapy chest wall ( without adjacent lymph node ) give daily Monday Friday 5-7 week . - After completion radiation therapy , tissue expander re-expanded eventually replaced permanent implant flap reconstruction discretion plastic surgeon . - Participants expect return Radiation Oncology Clinic follow-up visit 6 , 12 , 18 24 month end radiation therapy . Evaluation cosmetic result complication do visit use recognize score system photograph take time point score specific item ( necrosis , telangiectasia , etc ) .</detailed_description>
