	<brief_title>Pilot Phase II - Erlotinib Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . You take erlotinib mouth 1 time day . If severe side effect study drug , study doctor may decide stop drug dose side effect get well . Study Visits : Every week first 3 month every 2-4 week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test test liver kidney function . After 6 month , blood drawn every 6-8 week . At end Cycle 1 every 2-3 month , complete physical exam , ask side effect may drug take . At end Cycle 1 every 2-3 month 1 year , bone marrow aspirate . After 1 year , additional bone marrow aspirate perform study doctor think necessary . If significant side effect first 12 month , number blood draw bone marrow collection may lower 1 every 1-3 cycle . Length-of-Study : You may continue take study drug long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : You end-of-treatment visit 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) last dose erlotinib . At visit , ask symptom and/or side effect may . The end-of-treatment visit do phone one standard care clinic visit MD Anderson . If visit do phone , call last 15 minute . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . In disease type , currently use research purpose . Up 29 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
