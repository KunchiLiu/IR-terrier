	<brief_summary>When perform screen endoscopy , small focal gastric lesion frequently encounter . Novel technique endoscopy , magnify endoscopy ( ME ) narrow-band imaging ( NBI ) chromoendoscopy acetic acid-indigocarmine mixture ( AIM ) , develop enhance image gastrointestinal tumor . Furthermore , observation microstructures gastric mucosa ME , include microvascular pattern microsurface pattern , propose recognition early gastric cancer ( EGC ) . This study base hypothesis follow : 1 . The microvascular structure could clearly observe magnify endoscopy enhance narrow-band imaging ( ME-NBI ) . 2 . The microsurface architecture could clearly observe magnify endoscopy enhance acetic acid-indigocarmine mixture ( ME-AIM ) . 3 . Enhanced ME ( combine ME-NBI ME-AIM ) , compare white-light endoscopy ( WLE ) , high sensitivity specificity differential diagnose small focal gastric lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Magnifying Endoscopy Diagnosis Early Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive surveillance endoscopy EGC use zoom endoscope eligible inclusion . WLE without magnification perform first eligible patient . Based assessment shape ( flat , depressed elevate ) color ( pale redden ) , small focal gastric lesion identify included evaluation experience endoscopists . When lesion detect non-magnifying observation WLE , mode change ME-NBI observation microvascular pattern ME-AIM observation microsurface pattern subsequently . All endoscopic image whole procedure record digital filing system late evaluation . To avoid possible selection bias maintain quality study , image endoscopic modality ( include WLE , ME-NBI , ME-AIM ) , arrange randomly one slide display independently image endoscopic modality , evaluate 4 skilled endoscopists , access clinical pathological data . The general consensus establish assessment lesion . Two forceps biopsy specimen take lesion pathological diagnosis use criterion standard cancer diagnosis .</detailed_description>
