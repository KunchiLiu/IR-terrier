	<brief_summary>In 2011 , estimate 233,000 case invasive breast cancer , 39,970 death breast cancer United States . The vast majority patient diagnosed Stage I-III resectable potentially curable disease , patient , press question whether adjuvant endocrine chemotherapy indicate , , determine whether treatment work . Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces relative recurrence rate 30-50 % , depend age patient tumor characteristic . However , patient early stage disease often bear measurable marker disease elevated cancer antigen 27-29 ( CA27.29 ) circulate tumor cell . Patients early stage breast cancer typically treat adjuvant therapy base historical evidence show therapy prolongs survival population . Lung cancer common malignancy lead cause cancer-related death U.S . Approximately 220,000 new case lung cancer diagnose U.S. every year . Unfortunately , lung cancer often diagnose late stage breast cancer , due part little/no effective screening lung cancer . As breast cancer , patient commonly treat chemotherapeutic agent , treatment regimen take several week month elicit clinically detectable anti-tumor effect . A biomarker assess early tumor response therapy would benefit patient population . The content die tumor cell detect bloodstream , may enhance leaky vasculature solid tumor . Protein biomarkers tumor cell death difficult detect due complex nature plasma lack technical sensitivity . In contrast , DNA easy detect polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification . Indeed , circulate tumor DNA detect plasma patient osteosarcoma , breast cancer , colorectal cancer . Until recently , impractical develop assay routinely quantify circulate tumor DNA due heterogeneity patient tumor . Advances genomic technology permit sequence tumor genome identify patient-specific genomic aberration . Major genomic alteration ( i.e. , insertion , amplification , deletion , inversion , translocation ) readily detect use PCR primer recognize tumor DNA normal DNA . While strategy may generally applicable diverse type solid tumor , two issue apparent breast cancer . Firstly , incidence chromosomal rearrangement varies widely . Whole-genome sequence 15 breast tumor reveal range 1-231 major genomic alteration ( mean= 68 ) , 2 tumor 1 alteration , 9 tumor &gt; 20 alteration . Single-base point mutation common difficult reliably detect use PCR . Therefore , investigator must consider small subset patient may limited number genomic alteration available assay . Secondly , intratumoral heterogeneity may mean genomic alteration present every tumor cell . Such heterogeneity infer FISH immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) study many year , verify genomic level . The investigator must consider subpopulation tumor cell may sensitive cytotoxic therapy , change level circulate tumor DNA may reflect analysis genomic alteration specific sensitive cell .</brief_summary>
