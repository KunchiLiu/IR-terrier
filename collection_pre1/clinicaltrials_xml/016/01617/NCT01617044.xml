	<detailed_description>Project Summary : Iron deficiency common micronutrient deficiency world associate significant adverse health effect include : cognitive deficit , immune deficiency , anemia , fatigue , increased mortality . RLS affect 5 10 % adult United States 2 % child . The prevalence RLS child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) estimate 12 35 % . Iron deficiency recognize important factor RLS , current recommendation adult child RLS maintain serum ferritin level 50 mcg/l . A common problem treatment iron deficiency oral iron poorly absorb . Probiotics group microorganisms benefit host available naturally ferment food oral supplement . Naturally occur probiotic , yogurt use promote human health millennium . Probiotic oral supplement proven effective currently approve use pediatrics treatment : acute diarrhea , antibiotic associate diarrhea , atopy associate cow milk allergy ; evidence probiotic may useful treatment irritable bowel syndrome necrotizing enterocolitis . In study adult , cell culture experiment , probiotic improve iron absorption , question never study child . Relevance : This study propose compare standard treatment iron deficiency child ( supplemental iron plus vitamin C ) RLS ; supplemental iron plus vitamin C plus probiotic randomize , double-blind randomize controlled trial . Specific Aims : 1 . To improve treatment iron deficiency use oral iron , vitamin C , probiotic child RLS iron deficiency . 2 . To evaluate safety monitor adverse side effect treatment probiotic child RLS iron deficiency . Research Question : The research question study address whether addition specific strain probiotic ( lactobacillus plantarum 299 ) standard treatment iron deficiency ( supplemental iron + Vitamin C ) improve treatment iron deficiency . Children RLS study population RLS common diagnosis see sleep center , iron deficiency know trigger RLS , current standard care evaluation patient RLS check serum ferritin level time diagnosis treat supplemental iron serum ferritin &lt; 50 mcg/l . However , implication study go far beyond treatment child RLS iron deficiency .</detailed_description>
