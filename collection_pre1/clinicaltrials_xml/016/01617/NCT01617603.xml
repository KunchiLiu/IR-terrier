	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes acknowledge potential public health time bomb , whose incidence predict double next 10 year UK , associate rise obesity increase sedentary lifestyle . Increased insulin resistance show important feature type 2 diabetes ( especially present obesity particular visceral abdominal obesity ) . Insulin resistance implicate risk factor cardiovascular disease may lead pancreatic dysfunction increase Î²-cell stress pancreas . A combination insulin resistance pancreatic beta cell failure lead type 2 diabetes . The main cause morbidity mortality type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease condition associate impaired vascular functioning increase level oxidation marker . Epidemiological study suggest dietary flavonoid decrease risk death coronary heart disease , cancer , stroke . Flavonoid-rich food include fruit vegetable well tea , red wine , chocolate . In cohort elderly men , cocoa intake inversely associate blood pressure 15-year cardiovascular all-cause mortality . It report healthy human , consumption flavanol-rich dark chocolate decrease daytime night time blood pressure , reduce insulin resistance , improve nitric oxide dependent vaso-relaxation . Another trial find cocoa powder increase postprandial insulinaemia lean young adult . These research paper lead hypothesis chocolate contain high cocoa liquor may help reduce risk develop type 2 diabetes . This study design double-blind , control , single center , randomize , parallel design clinical trial . The primary outcome measure compare parameter insulin resistance glycaemic control volunteer type 2 diabetes consumption 3 different chocolate ( one dark two milk chocolate ) secondary outcome endothelial function , cholesterol profile oxidative stress . Subjects undergo medical screening , anthropometry , physical activity dietary assessment randomization .</brief_summary>
