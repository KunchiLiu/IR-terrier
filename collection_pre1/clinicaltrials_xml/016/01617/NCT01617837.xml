	<brief_title>The Efficacy P6 Acupressure Reducing Postoperative Nausea Vomiting Patients Undergoing Craniotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study investigate P6 acupressure reduce postoperative nausea craniotomy . Calculation sample size base assumption detect difference 20 % patient ( 38 % control group vs 18 % acupressure group ) primary endpoint ; incidence nausea first 24 hour postoperatively , significance level 5 % power 80 % , guide earlier study similar population ( Wang et . al . 2010 ) assumption 38 % patient suffer nausea . These assumption suggest sample size 78 patient ( 39 patient / group ) result sample size 80 patient cover attrition . Secondary aim investigate frequency vomit need antiemetic reduce P6 acupressure . Patients randomly assign one two treatment group use computer-generated random number table , either P6 acupressure group placebo group . Randomization seal study envelope , contain study material follow patient study , perform person research department , involve data collection . Information study protocol include envelope . The randomization take place preoperatively . Sea-Band® , single-sized elastic acupressure band plastic button place P6 apply pressure use . One group receive active acupressure band identical placebo band without button . Before enter operation ward wrists marked place P6 , perform staff neurosurgical ward . The active acupressure band placebo band administered end surgery . They place unilaterally wrist nurse anesthetist performs patient 's anesthesia . The manufacturer 's guideline place band include envelope study material . Both P6 acupressure band placebo band cover bandage ensure blind patient nursing staff involve postoperative care . Both P6 acupressure band placebo band remove 48 hour postoperatively . If band cause discomfort , remove 30 minute every two hour , perform staff involve postoperative care , instruction cover wrist cotton roll air arm , ensure blinding acupressure cause betrayal mark . At end surgery patient receive ondansetron 4mg IV . Droperidol IV administer additional perioperative antiemetic consider necessary . Postoperatively rescue antiemetic administrate accord current routine . The administered drug 0,625-1,25mg droperidol 1-4mg ondansetron , either alone combination . Postoperative opioid administration ( morphine ketobemidone ) also record time study Before operation patient fill health declare formula routine anesthetic preparation . This formula include four risk factor PONV , accord Apfel colleague ( Apfel et al . 1999 ) . To clarify early PONV specific question issue formula write consent . During 48 hour postoperatively patient evaluate nausea register formula frequency vomit . The first evaluation take part arrive postoperative care unit every hour first six hour , every third hour hour 24 thereafter every sixth hour hour 25-48 . A Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) 0-10 use , 0 mean nausea 10 bad nausea possible . The patient ask whether experienced nausea within previous period time . Assessment nausea registration vomit frequency perform staff unaware patient 's group postoperative care unit/neurosurgical ward patient possible . After discharge data NRS formula collect . The patient ' journal screen administrated antiemetic opioids , potential risk factor PONV demographic relevant study outcome . All data save anonymously software Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) . Overall PONV define least one episode nausea vomit observation time 48 h. Rescue therapy define least one dosage either droperidol ondansetron observation time 48 h. Early PONV define PONV occur 6 hour postoperatively late PONV 7-48 hour postoperatively .</detailed_description>
