	<brief_title>Randomised Study Azacitidine Versus Azacitidine With Vorinostat Patients With AML High Risk MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML ) common haematological malignancy . As result improvement myelosuppressive chemotherapy stem cell transplantation , outcome child young adult AML improve substantially past three decade . By contrast limited progress development new treatment old adult long term survival le 20 % present . There urgent need develop effective treatment option treatment AML high risk MDS old adult . Accumulating evidence suggest Azacitidine potentially important treatment modality newly diagnose , relapsed/refractory AML high risk MDS . Phase II trial AML MDS demonstrate increase clinical activity azacitidine combine HDACi . However randomised trial yet examine important question whether concurrent HDACi administration increase clinical activity Azacitidine . Vorinostat new HDACi show significant clinical activity combination Azacitidine patient AML MDS . We therefore propose randomised trial azacitidine compare azacitidine vorinostat combination therapy old adult newly diagnose , relapse , refractory AML high risk MDS ineligible intensive chemotherapy . This represent first randomise trial , address whether clinical benefit gain combine treatment azacitidine HDACi patient newly diagnose , relapse , refractory AML high risk MDS limit therapeutic option currently exist .</detailed_description>
