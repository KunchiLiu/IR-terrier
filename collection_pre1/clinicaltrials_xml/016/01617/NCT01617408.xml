	<brief_summary>Background : - The brain two system recognize object . One system recognize object , system recognize object locate . However , much brain handle interpret information two system still unclear . Researchers want study part brain involve vision process . They use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) brain . MRI measure part brain become active task perform . TMS use magnetic pulse temporarily change activity part brain . Objectives : - To well understand people visually recognize different type object . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - This study include many different experiment vision . Each experiment may combine visual task , MRI scan , TMS . Participants may ask several different test . Each test require separate visit National Institutes Health . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They baseline brain scan first visit . - Participants may visual task alone , MRI , TMS , MRI TMS combine . For visual task , look picture object computer screen . Sometimes images appear briefly ( less one-tenth second ) . Sometimes appear 5 second . These image thing like face , body , tool , scene . Participants ask respond different way picture . They may respond type computer keyboard press button . Participants time practice task experiment . - Participants remain study 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective An influential model cortical organization proposes primate visual system divide two functionally distinct pathway ( Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin , 1982 ) . The ventral visual pathway , project occipital cortex ventral temporal cortex , principally use object recognition identification . The dorsal pathway , project occipital cortex parietal cortex , principally use locate position object visual field action planning ( Milner &amp; Goodale , 1995 ; Kravitz et al. , 2011 ) . In proposed series experiment investigate neural representation ventral dorsal pathway contribute range cognitive task include object scene recognition , attentional selection face processing . These experiment principally use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) combination functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . TMS provide unique experimental tool study human cognitive function use transiently safely disrupt neural processing target cortical region subject perform concurrent behavioral task depend operation region . Furthermore TMS combine neuroimaging technique fMRI examine remote effect induce neural disruption task-dependent region distribute across cortex . We plan use TMS address unanswered question concern functioning distribute neural network different category object recognition attention network human brain . Study Population We plan test 320 neurologically normal subject age 18 50 year old . Subjects also take part fMRI experiment prior subsequent TMS experiment order localize stimulation sit interest . Design The aim propose series experiment examine effect TMS induce neural disruption behavioral task performance neural correlate impair performance measure fMRI . Broadly experiment divide study use online offline TMS . In on-line experiment , TMS apply behavioral task . In off-line experiment , theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) deliver experimental task off-line experiment may combine TBS fMRI . - TMS target site localization Prior online offline study subject take part fMRI experiment design localize particular cortical region interest ( ROIs ) . The fMRI experiment require subject view either series different object category ( e.g . face , body , scene ) flicker section black white checkerboard fMRI scanner . The result fMRI experiment use identify region cortex target TMS . We identify TMS target site use stereotaxic Brainsight co-registration software scalp location mark individually subject . -Online behavioral TMS experiment Online TMS experiment design address direct effect induce neural disruption target TMS site . TMS deliver every trial ass effect concurrent task performance . Subjects perform range visual behavioral task online TMS deliver cortical region interest control sit ( e.g . vertex ) . Repetitive TMS deliver frequency 10Hz 500ms . In experiment alternatively deliver double-pulse TMS different latency stimulus onset ass target region likely involved task performance . -Offline TBS experiment Offline thetaburst ( TBS ) experiment also design assess effect induce disruption stimulate region . However , rather deliver TMS every experimental trial Thetaburst TMS ( TBS ) deliver targeted region interest ( ROI ) latencies 60 second prior subject perform behavioral task . The neural effect induce disruption show last 30 minute ( Huang et al. , 2005 ) . In offline TBS experiment propose deliver 60 second TBS stimulate ROI . In proposed experiment participant place fMRI scanner TBS stimulation . During fMRI session subject perform series visual discrimination task assess effect TBS disruption behavior activity remote cortical area measure BOLD activation . Outcome measure The dependent variable online behavioral TMS experiment performance accuracy , sensitivity ( ) reaction time ( RT ) measure collect concurrently perform behavioral task . Dependent variable offline fMRI TBS experiment task performance well reduced neuronal activity measure decreased BOLD activation target remote ROIs .</detailed_description>
