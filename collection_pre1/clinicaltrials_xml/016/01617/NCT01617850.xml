	<brief_summary>Physical rehabilitation key element treatment patient cardiovascular disease , recent evidence show supervised exercise programme prevent cardiovascular event , improve physical function quality life . Individualized exercise prescription base appropriate frequency , intensity duration recommend . Furthermore , recent study show physical cardiac exercise training influence inflammation vessel wall hence reduce development arteriosclerosis coronary vessel . In literature divergent conclusion appropriate frequency duration physical rehabilitation program order improve physical function reduce arteriosclerosis . The purpose study investigate efficacy optimized physical rehabilitation programme compare conventional programme physical fitness , health relate quality life vascular inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Physical Exercise Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both trial group carry physical exercise training group . The exercise training instruct two physiotherapist expertise cardiac rehabilitation . Each training session take 60 minute base current evidence physical training IHD CHF patient . Exercise intensity progress within first week training program moderate intensity ( 40-59 % VO2max ) , high intensity ( 60-84 % VO2max ) . Exercise intensity individual training session monitor heart rate . The training program include follow : Warm-up stretching : Each training session start 10 min . warm-up end 5 min . stretch . Aerobic exercise : Takes place treadmill , stair , ergometer bike interval train different strength-endurance exercise . Muscle strength : Is perform machine weight train equipment floor exercise . 10-15 repetition perform load equivalent 50-60 % 1 RM . The exercise program group perform use standardized exercise protocol . All patient per sub-maximal maximal exercise test prior participation physical exercise training program .</detailed_description>
