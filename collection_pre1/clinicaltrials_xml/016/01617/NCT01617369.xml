	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn long hypertonic saline ( HS ) work healthy subject . Inhaled hypertonic saline one medication use treat Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . In CF common lung disease like chronic bronchitis , mucus build lung . Hypertonic saline medication currently develop may help patient lung disease speed mucus clearance lung . For treatment effective , likely need able act lease several hour . Investigators able measure lung treatment like hypertonic saline work conduct Mucociliary Clearance ( MCC ) scan . Currently , investigator know long hypertonic saline work people CF . Investigators plan use information improve design test new treatment patient chronic bronchitis . Objectives : 1 . The investigator use MCC measurement determine durability action hypertonic saline healthy ( i.e . non-CF ) subject . 2 . The investigator determine intra- inter-individual variability baseline MCC measurement use slow inhalation/large particle protocol healthy subject guide future sample size calculation .</brief_summary>
