	<brief_summary>The purpose research study know antibiotic azithromycin , antibiotic approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat infection , improve symptom severity child sudden severe onset obsessive compulsive symptom know PANS , Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome , PANDAS , Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated Streptococcus . This study seek compare effect placebo vs. azithromycin Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) symptom severity well assess immune risk factor child PANDAS/PANS . Obsessions repetitive , unwanted thought worry may unpleasant , silly , embarrass . Compulsions repetitive ritualistic action perform ease anxiety worry . Doctors think symptom may cause exacerbate certain infection Streptococcus pyogenes , Mycoplasma pneumonia , Borrelia burgordfi , etc . These infection commonly cause strep throat , walk pneumonia , Lyme Disease , among others . This study involve 4 week double-blind , placebo-controlled randomize trial azithromycin ( Double Blind Phase ) . At end 4 week trial , child assign azithromycin 8 week ( Open Label Phase ) . At end 12 week , Naturalistic Observation phase ass child 's symptom characteristic 40 week .

	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence suggest subset child obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) symptom course temporally associate infection ( group A Streptococcus , Mycoplasma , Borrelia burgordfi , etc. ) . The intent proposal test hypothesis : 1 ) subset child OCD know Pediatric Acute Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome ( PANS ) specific subset associate Streptococcus , PANDAS ( Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated Streptococcus ) , experience symptom onset exacerbation due autoimmune/inflammatory response infectious trigger , 2 ) antibiotic treatment reduce symptom severity . Investigators report improvement neuropsychiatric symptom patient present PANDAS follow antibiotic treatment ( Murphy &amp; Pichichero , 2002 ; Snider , Lougee , Slattery et al. , 2005 ) . Difficulties study design small sample size early antibiotic trial limit influence finding ( Kurlan &amp; Kaplan , 2004 ) although anecdotally , many family report often dramatic improvement OCD symptom antibiotic therapy . The propose study 4 week double-blind placebo-controlled study efficacy azithromycin daily OCD symptom severity child age 4-14 year present PANS phenotype . An 8 week open label phase offer subject complete 1-month trial ass long term efficacy tolerability ( 12 week total antibiotic active , 8 week placebo ) . At end week 8 , child transition best clinical care practice ( cognitive behavioral therapy , additional medication trial , etc ) fully remit . The rate timing relapse assess primary outcome variable . Evaluations consist : 1 ) semi-structured psychiatric diagnostic interview rating scale establish psychiatric diagnosis monitor severity psychiatric symptom , particularly obsessive compulsive behavior tic ; 2 ) parent child-report questionnaire elicit information regard infection clinical correlate PANS attribute ; 3 ) physical neurological examination ; 4 ) laboratory study . Aim 1 : To compare , randomize controlled fashion , placebo vs. antibiotic change overall symptom severity obsessive-compulsive symptom among child PANS phenotype . Changes baseline clinical status end study compare study arm . Primary endpoint change Children 's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale ( CY-BOCS ) . Secondary measure interest include severity improvement measure Clinical Global Impression Severity/Improvement scale , quality life measure , weekly rating mood , anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity tic symptom . Hypothesis : Children receive antibiotic show significantly great overall improvement severity compare placebo . Children meet PANDAS/PANS criterion current OCD symptom less 6 month duration enrol double-blind placebo-controlled randomize trial azithromycin 4 week . Subjects follow weekly 3 month ( 4-week antibiotic treatment trial , 8 week open label treatment ) . Although early trial mixed result , study primarily enrol subject longer illness duration use traditional prophylactic dos contrast standard treatment dose study . Since treatment dos antibiotic decrease antigenic load , one speculate treatment level dos , rather prophylactic dos , may best attenuate neuropsychiatric sequela . Secondary neuromodulating immune modulating property higher dose antibiotic may also possible mode therapeutic action . The timing treatment response moderator predictor response also assess . Aim 2 : To assess immune risk factor child PANDAS/PANS . The data biological specimen ( blood , culture , etc ) subject consent Aim 1 , enter database repository assess clinical phenotype . Subjects qualify randomization ( medication allergy current long term antibiotic therapy ) decline randomization ( e.g . travel required future visit ) permit contribute Aim 2 , i.e . collection baseline symptom severity immune marker assessment . Hypothesis : It hypothesize child sudden onset OCD whose subsequent course show dramatic fluctuation evidence immune risk factor predispose presentation . Certain subject characteristic age , duration illness , characteristic exacerbation episode , type number prior infection , co-occurring disorder may influence treatment response . Immunologic marker may help determine pathobiology treatment response explore include pathogen detection array identify potential infectious trigger , cytokine array explore inflammatory process specific antibody assay assess potential mediator . In order differentiate child may benefit antibiotic prophylaxis benefit , analytic strategy refine antibiotic-responsive phenotype explore . Rationale : Based PI 's observation research clinical patient refer PANDAS ( 60 patient per year ) , patient improvement high dos antibiotic use , often relapse prophylactic dos . The best response rate antibiotic design treat beta lactamase co-pathogens azithromycin , cephalosporins amoxicillin/clavulanic acid . Observed response rate typically within 3 week although subject appear take long gain response . These observation deserve study . Azithromycin chosen due improve tolerance , daily dose regimen , coverage microbe implicate PANS low risk allergic reaction exclusion . Randomization : Study medication match placebo provide research pharmacy . Some service provide include blind study drug , package labeling , randomization . Subjects randomize receive either antibiotic placebo 1:1 ratio . Both investigator study participant blind treatment assignment . Randomization reveal investigator study participant participant complete study event serious adverse event ( SAE ) . Dosing : Azithromycin placebo every 24 hour dispense . Antibiotic transfer identical bottle placebo dispense without manufacturer label . Labels identical match dose volume . Flavor , color texture match best ability . Participants parent instruct discuss actual medication anyone study team except designate person dispense medication . Study participation entirely voluntary . If time participant wish discontinue use study medication , notify study coordinator family willing , choose enter naturalistic phase discontinue study . Naturalistic Observation Phase : After subject 's completion active phase study ( baseline EOW12 determine subject eligibility , medication tolerance , etc ) , family give choice opt opt naturalistic follow monthly basis EOW 52 . The family provide monthly PANS scale questionnaire regard child 's current treatment . Depending option work best , return form mail complete online . Compliance Monitoring : Azithromycin , daily dose , high rate adherence antibiotic frequent dosing . The parent child educate optimal dosing compliance . Each unit dose label specifically participant ID number . The clinical coordinator document batch medication dispense log . Each batch study medication include supply next schedule visit plus one week cover difficulty return study schedule interval . All study medication account throughout study investigator designee . End Treatment Alternatives : Standard care treatment option unavailable initial 8 week , point family multiple option post-study care need . Until good guideline develop , child PANDAS/PANS subgroup also give chance benefit evidence base treatment may lessen severity future flare . From previous work ( Storch , Murphy , Geffken et al. , 2006 ) , believe remain OCD symptom best treat CBT unless child still severe engage therapy . CBT help child remodel automatic response obsession , teach skill prove helpful symptom recur also help family behavioral strategy lessen risk disrupt functioning accommodation . Children often report feel empower coping , relaxation , resiliency skill learn CBT . Antidepressants approve OCD option consider appear chronic stable course many youth PANS presentation incapacitate sudden severe symptom , many parent feel desperate ( Murphy , observation ) wait typical 10-12 week SSRIs achieve full efficacy . Many child highly sensitive usual starting dos ( Murphy , Storch , &amp; Strawser , 2006 ) well start low dose ( e.g . sertraline 6.25mg ) gradually increase tolerate . Patients tic respond well variety evidence base pharmacologic agent behavioral treatment need due symptom severity impairment . Following study subject incomplete remission refer CBT outpatient clinic community base parent preference . The investigative team considerable experience application approach pediatric OCD ( Murphy et al. , 2007 ) collaborate closely outpatient provider . Adverse effect : Every effort make identify prior history adverse effect antibiotic prior randomization phase ( exclusion criterion ) . In event Candidiasis , opportunistic overgrowth allergic reaction , recommendation PCP child follow . As adverse event unlikely except treatment antibiotic , blind compromise child consider drop due adverse event . Open label probiotic provide subject study arm phase take daily . In event SAE , blind broken know treatment status significance course treatment . If time blind becomes otherwise compromise , subject exit RCT portion study . The date , time , reason situation surround unblinding must document completely possible . All SAEs also report IRB soon possible . Laboratory test ( CBC , metabolic panel , urine toxicology pregnancy test [ post-pubescent female ] ) EKG obtain baseline . Every 2 week , liver function test do monitor hepatic toxicity risk well EKG monitor cardiac risk ( increase QTc ) .</detailed_description>
