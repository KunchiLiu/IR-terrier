	<brief_title>Therapeutic Hypothermia After Return Spontaneous Circulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction therapeutic hypothermia return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) medical cardiac arrest increasingly become standard care hospital setting . Several study , include two sentinel research paper New England Journal Medicine , show improved neurologic outcome induce therapeutic hypothermia ( ITH ) . 4 , 5 This research lead class IIa recommendation American Heart Association ITH ROSC V-Fib arrest class IIb recommendation ROSC class medial cardiac arrest.6 The role ITH pre-hospital setting less clear . Studies currently exist show benefit fail support improve outcomes.7-9 It suggest short transport time urban EMS system might part reason study fail find benefit ITH pre-hospital setting . This prospective , randomize control trial involve patient transport CCEMS ROSC medical cardiac arrest transport hospital continue ITH 24 hour . All comatose patient meet inclusion criterion randomize either ITH addition continue treatment standing protocol regular care without ITH . Assignment two treatment arm do use EMS number generate ambulance dispatch call . Even number patient continued standard therapy odd number patient receive ITH .</detailed_description>
