	<brief_summary>Spatial neglect represent one major cognitive disorder follow stroke . Patients patient fail aware object people leave orientate instead right side . Enduring neglect find poor prognostic indicator functional independence follow stroke . Despite promising experimental account establish treatment condition . The aim study test whether combine treatment hemifield eye patching ( HEP ) optokinetic stimulation ( OKS ) permanently reduce neglect behaviour improve functional outcome patient hemispatial neglect follow stroke . The investigator hypothesise treatment HEP OKS lead great reduction neglect score neglect test battery well great improvement functional independence score compare spontaneous clinical course usual-care control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The HEP-OKS Study - Hemifield Eye Patching Optokinetic Stimulation Treat Hemispatial Neglect Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To specify , study answer follow main question : Does daily wear hemifield eye patch period 1 week combination daily session optokinetic stimulation lead significant reduction neglect behaviour measure total score paper-and-pencil neglect test battery and/or improvement functional independence score ( Catherine-Bergego-Scale , Barthel Index ) cohort stroke patient acute hemispatial neglect compare spontaneous course disease control patient group without neglect-specific treatment ?</detailed_description>
