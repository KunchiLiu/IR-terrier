	<brief_summary>We study whether men treat prostate cancer amount side effect either one two different external radiation treatment : IMRT PBT . With IMRT , number x-ray beam use shape radiation prostate . PBT another type external radiation treatment prostate cancer use center United States . Protons tiny particle positive charge control travel certain distance stop . PBT precise like IMRT , use proton beam instead x-ray beam . IMRT PBT aim deliver radiation prostate cancer spar surround tissue . Both IMRT PBT use treatment prostate cancer think equally effective cure prostate cancer . However , treatment also show cause potential side effect radiation , include bowel , urinary erectile problem . It possible side effect rate PBT low , , even high IMRT , study well date . Though radiation therapy use past treat prostate cancer , never study compare effect two therapy see one less side effect . In research study , compare IMRT PBT determine therapy best minimizes side effect treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Therapy vs. IMRT Low Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because one know study option best , `` randomize '' one study group : IMRT PBT . Randomization mean put group chance , like flip coin . Neither research doctor choose group . You equal chance place either group . Randomization make study well scientific point view help ensure patient receive IMRT proton therapy similar . You receive one type radiation , either IMRT PBT throughout participation study . Before begin radiation therapy pelvic CT scan order design radiation treatment . Doctors use information gather scan plan best way deliver radiation tumor . Both type radiation therapy give day 5 day ( weekend holiday ) 9 week . Both IMRT PBT require lie table le 15 minute obtain treatment . During visit ask question general health specific question problem might medication might take . You also undergo physical exam complete quality life questionnaire . After radiation therapy follow visit 3,6,9,12,18,24,36,48 60 month .</detailed_description>
