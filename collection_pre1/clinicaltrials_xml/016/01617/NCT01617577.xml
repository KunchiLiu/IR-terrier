	<brief_summary>Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) widely use treatment patient deficiency white blood cell . It also routinely used stimulate mobilize stem/progenitor cell bone marrow transplantation . In study thousand healthy donor subject treat G-CSF , side-effects profile report mild reversible . Currently , G-CSF investigation clinical trial Germany US aim enhance recovery stroke heart attack . In animal study , G-CSF observe improve cognitive performance markedly reduce amyloid deposition hippocampus entorhinal cortex mouse model Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . Since drug use safely many people throughout world , investigator hypothesize also safe give patient Alzheimer 's disease may improve aspect memory thinking . The present pilot study two goal objective : 1 ) investigate effect five day schedule Filgrastim administration cognitive function 2 ) ass tolerability safety small group ( 12 patient ) mild moderate stage AD . Patients eligible study randomly assign one two group ( n=6 per group ) . One group receive five-day course Filgrastim injection group subject receive vehicle injection ( solution without drug ) . At end first phase study ( week 8 ) , group cross receive either vehicle Filgrastim appropriate . In way subject receive active medication end study . After study finish investigator know whether Filgrastim improve aspect think memory . And investigator know whether safe give medication patient Alzheimer 's disease . To ensure drug safe , Safety Monitoring Committee oversee entire study . They review laboratory data , include complete blood count , serum chemistry , EKGs adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study originally design two arm ( GCSF first follow placebo= Arm 1 ; placebo follow GCSF=Arm2 ) . Total length study subject 14 week , crossover week 7 . Linear regression model could use small number subject ; n = 5 first Arm receive G-CSF crossover placebo phase n = 3 Arm 2 ( receive placebo first crossover G-CSF treatment phase ) . The general rule sample size require regression analysis n = 15 per covariate . Therefore , comparison final cognitive score visit 5 ( week 14 ) compare score baseline ( visit 1 ) subject ( n = 8 ) use Wilcoxon sign rank test . Plasma cytokine change plot compare effect follow G-CSF follow placebo , regardless order treatment . Wilcoxon sum rank test use test difference G-CSF treatment placebo treatment specific interval treatment . Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS Version 19 ) use data analysis .</detailed_description>
