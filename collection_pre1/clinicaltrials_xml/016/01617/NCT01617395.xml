	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show gene environment influence person risk get multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . However , possible accurately predict develop MS . Researchers want study people MS family member . They develop Genetic Environmental Risk Score MS . This score combine information person 's medical history gene . It also include environmental factor may relate develop MS . This study test risk score see help predict develop MS . Objectives : - To evaluate score genetic environmental risk factor may help predict whether person develop MS . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age MS. - Individuals 18 50 year age parent , brother , sister , child person MS. Design : - People MS allow researcher look personal medical data . These data collect MS-related study . - Relatives people MS fill questionnaire give blood saliva sample . They fill questionnaire one year later . - Some relative additional optional testing . These test include physical exam image study . There may also test . These test may repeat every 1 5 year 20 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective . The overall objective study investigate genetic , immune , neuroimaging profile may increase person risk develop multiple sclerosis ( MS ) order identify validate predictive biomarkers population risk disorder . Study population . There three study population : 1 . Individuals risk develop MS As part Genes Environment Multiple Sclerosis ( GEMS ) study , plan recruit 1000 first-degree relative MS patient . GEMS study 5000 individual lead collaborator Brigham &amp; Women Hospital Harvard University . For purpose study , first-degree relative may parent , sibling , child 18 50 year age must carry diagnosis MS . The first-degree relative must ability provide consent willing participate study . Two potentially overlap subset individual undergo detailed test NIH : 1 . The cross-sectional subcohort consist 100 participant combine genetic environmental risk score ( GERS ) , define protocol , high low 20 percent entire study population . Selected participant may invite follow-up study base data obtain baseline symptom develop . 2 . The NINDS longitudinal subcohort consist 100 participant , age 18 40 , express willingness follow 20 year NIH , whose GERS fall top 20 percent entire study population , first-degree relative MS participating . 2 . MS patient We plan recruit 1000 MS patient whose first-degree relative enrol study . These participant either : ( A ) evaluate Neuroimmunology Branch protocols undergo separate evaluation protocol ; ( B ) send u medical record confirm MS diagnosis via mail/fax/secure email , without requirement participate another NIH protocol . The purpose include cohort current study allow access clinical , biological , image data comparison first-degree relative , available , confirm exist GEMS participant first-degree relative diagnose MS. 3 . Healthy volunteer We plan recruit 80 healthy volunteer , age 18-50 , know first-degree relative MS . The purpose include cohort current study allow quantification degree extent abnormality , include abnormality blood-brain barrier , individual risk develop MS . Without image data obtain healthy volunteer , way determine whether subtle clinical neuroimaging finding at-risk cohort truly abnormal , correctly threshold quantify observe abnormality . Design . This prospective cohort natural-history study . All GEMS participant complete follow study procedure , perform offsite : informed consent ; study questionnaire ; saliva sample ; blood draw . The questionnaire repeat 1 year enrollment . There two additional substudies conduct NIH : cross-sectional substudy longitudinal substudy . Participants substudies evaluate clinical , radiological , laboratory procedure . Participants cross-sectional cohort undergo evaluation NIH single time point ( optional longitudinal follow ) , whereas participant longitudinal cohort undergo evaluation NIH 20 year . There interim analysis 5 year 50th participant recruit longitudinal cohort , study cohort terminate observed development MS-related radiological laboratory abnormality participant . Participants MS provide inform consent allow access research data , data ( already ) collect Neuroimmunology Branch clinical protocol . NIH unique site within overall GEMS study , follow reason : ( 1 ) It site image perform , part cross-sectional longitudinal substudies ; ( 2 ) GEMS participant see NIH may undergo additional procedure part overall GEMS study ; ( 3 ) The NIH substudy prospective design built-in long-term follow-up longitudinal cohort , whereas overall GEMS study one year plan follow-up ; ( 4 ) Data participant NIH substudy directly link data relative MS . Outcome measure . For participant overall GEMS study , primary outcome measure GERS , participant cohort undergo testing . For participant cross-sectional cohort , consist individual high low risk MS , primary outcome measure presence absence lesion T2-weighted brain MRI meet 2010 MRI criterion dissemination space finding , population , likely related MS. For participant longitudinal cohort , study endpoint clinical diagnosis MS accord 2010 criterion . Secondary outcome measure include : ( 1 ) The age participant develop MS-related abnormality brain imaging study , abnormality laboratory test , clinical symptom sign ; ( 2 ) The time lag define exposure ( example , infectious mononucleosis ) appearance MS-related radiological , laboratory , clinical abnormality ; ( 3 ) The time lag appearance asymptomatic radiological laboratory abnormality onset clinical symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : GEMS cohort ( target n equal 1000 ) Firstdegree relative ( parent , sibling , child ) selfreported MS patient . Age 1850 , inclusive , time enrollment overall GEMS study . Willingness contact regard additional followup procedure . Crosssectional subcohort ( target n equal 100 ) : Referred Harvard genetic environmental risk score ( GERS ) , define Section 4.1.1 , top bottom 20 % overall GEMS study . NINDS Longitudinal subcohort ( target n equal 100 ) : Ages 1840 , inclusive . Referred Harvard GERS top 20 % overall GEMS study . Willing undergo additional study procedure NIH 20 year , plan followup every year participant age 18 25 , every 2 year participant age 26 30 , every 5 year participant age 31 40 . Relative enrol NIH study confirmation MS diagnosis . MS patient cohort ( target n=1000 ) : MS patient ( NIH ) Coenrolled another Neuroimmunology Branch natural history protocol . Diagnosis confirm NIH . Age 18 older . MS patient ( nonNIH ) Firstdegree relative ( parent , sibling , child ) exist GEMS participant . Able willing send medical record associate MS diagnosis NIH . Healthy volunteer cohort ( target n=80 ) Age 1850 , inclusive . No known firstdegree relative ( parent , sibling , child ) MS. All cohorts Able give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : GEMS cohort Diagnosis MS. Crosssectional NINDS longitudinal subcohorts Contraindications MRI scan . Diagnosis another central nervous system disease disease ( CNS neoplasm , know cerebrovascular disease , know CNS degenerative disease , know CNS inflammatory disease ) time enrollment study . MS cohort ( ) Healthy volunteer cohort Diagnosis MS another central nervous system ( CNS neoplasm , cerebrovascular disease CNS degenerative disease , CNS inflammatory disease ) systemic disease would interfere aim study . Contraindications MRI scanning .</criteria>
