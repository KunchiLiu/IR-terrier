	<brief_title>A Randomized , Phase 2 , Neoadjuvant Study Weekly Paclitaxel With Without LCL161 Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , randomize , two-arm , open-label , neoadjuvant , multicenter study newly diagnose woman triple-negative breast cancer . Eligible patient limited clinical stage T2 , N0-N2 , M0 . For patient triple-negative disease identify diagnostic biopsy , presence absence gene expression signature determine molecular pre-screening phase use diagnostic biopsy material ; patient TNBC positive negative gene expression signature eligible enrollment . Following Screening/baseline period determine eligibility , patient randomize either paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV give weekly ( control arm ) paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly immediately follow LCL161 1800 mg PO weekly ( experimental arm ) . Enrollment arm balance within region world stratify 1:1 gene expression signature status . Treatment administer week 12 week ( 4 cycle ) . The length treatment cycle 21 day . A total 200 patient enrol treat , 100 patient treatment arm study ; arm contain 50 patient gene expression signature positive disease 50 patient gene expression signature negative disease . An interim analysis plan study approximately 50 patient gene expression signature positive disease treat either complete study undergone surgery , permanently discontinue study treatment reason . For patient , tumor biopsy perform approximately 24 hour first second dose study treatment ( paclitaxel paclitaxel + LCL161 ) compare extent apoptosis tumor treat control experimental therapy . Patients schedule breast-conserving surgery mastectomy 15 week plus window 1 week date subject receive first treatment ( 16 week first treatment ) . All treat patient plan undergo surgery . However , evaluate presence persistent disease patient apparent substantial residual progressive disease undergo surgery reason must core needle biopsy primary tumor complete study treatment . At completion study treatment , patient expect continue post-operative treatment standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen FAC ( 5-FU/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ) , FEC ( 5-FU/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide ) AC ( doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ) . The specific regimen choose treat physician .</detailed_description>
