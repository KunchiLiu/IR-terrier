	<brief_summary>Dysautonomia , primarily define postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) seriously disrupt child 's daily activity . It commonly associate nausea abdominal pain . In preliminary study , orthostatic intolerance treat fludrocortisone , standard therapy orthostatic intolerance ( OI ) , symptomatic improvement nausea observe . However , child POTS also observe high supine mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) ( preliminary data ) great suppression baroreceptor reflex sensitivity ( BRS ) occur upon up-right tilt . While fludrocortisone alleviate nausea associate OI , long-term use may pose long term health risk child include worsen hypertension . Therefore , objective study define mechanism OI relate nausea . The investigator hypothesize OI result change autonomic nervous system likely mechanism nausea observe patient study . The investigator hypothesize potentially early marker future cardiovascular problem early onset hypertension cardiac hypertrophy . The general objective protocol address gap knowledge determine autonomic characteristic child OI well define neurohumoral profile subject well understand cause elevate supine subject . By good understand potential mechanism condition , investigator future goal develop focus safer treatment strategy . The investigator study subject 10 18 year age utilizing tilt table mimic daily life stressor also measure serum level epinephrine , norepinephrine , rennin , angiotensin II , aldosterone , vasopressin baseline tilt . This study generate data high impact rational treatment management dysautonomia could choose basis profile dysautonomia neurohumoral marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dysautonomia result decrease HRV impaired BRS , may accompany supine hypertension , know play role development progression hypertension , lead hypertensive heart disease include leave ventricular hypertrophy congestive heart failure well cardiovascular problem stroke , 4-6 . The long-term cardiovascular consequence decrease HRV impair BRS present childhood know , experimental model cardiovascular dysfunction , BRS HRV impairment precede eventual elevation MAP 7 . Dysautonomia symptom OI find nearly 500,000 Americans approximately 15 % child experience syncope end adolescence 8 , 9 . The majority individual develop severe autonomic failure disorder adult ( pure autonomic failure multiple system atrophy ) , whether great cardiovascular risk hypertension , stroke cardiac hypertrophy heart failure know . Our preliminary finding child present GI clinic chronic unexplained nausea show dysautonomia manifest OI trigger nausea 15 17 patient , nausea subject substantially improve aldosterone agonist fludrocortisones 1 . These child exhibit predominately POTS1 , contrast syncope neurally mediate hypotension ( NMH ) typically see pediatric cardiology clinics10 . POTS autonomic disorder characterize excessive increase heart rate ( HR ) upon upright posture 11 . It may present palpitation , shortness breath , nausea , lightheadedness , syncope . Fludrocortisone acetate standard treatment orthostatic symptom associate POTS , think volume expander offset low aldosterone report adult OI 12 , 13 . This first time association OI gastrointestinal symptom describe . Posturally mediated heart rate ( HR ) change result abnormal gastric electrical activity patient functional abdominal pain recently show children14 . While may seem nausea GI symptom relevant CV disease AHA , preliminary data suggest treatment remedy CV dysautomomia also reduce chronic unexplained nausea majority child without correct gastric dysrhythmias , suggest nausea secondary CV dysatuonomia . However , significant knowledge therapy gap field cause pathophysiologic mechanism ( ) either chronic nausea POTS group remain essentially undefined . Furthermore , recognize treatment OI associate nausea , alpha aldosterone agonist , may alleviate gastrointestinal symptom , exacerbate undefined cardiovascular pathology multiple mechanism . Therefore , immediate goal well understand specific autonomic disturbance patient chronic unexplained nausea allow timely good selection drug manage GI CV symptom subject . In past year , use combination tilt table continuous autonomic assessment provide complete data autonomic profile subject , include baroreflex sensitivity control HR ( BRS ) , heart rate variability ( HRV ) blood pressure variability ( BPV ) . The head-up tilt mimic daily life stressor ( upright posture/standing ) response pattern provide additional diagnostic information important patient management . Our preliminary finding show supine MAP elevate subject POTS compare control group ( nausea normal tilt test ) . In addition , upright posture BRS HRV impair ~50 % normal subject , whereas &gt; 80 % suppression BRS occur POTS subject 2 , 3 , suggest BRS suppression may lead least play permissive role inappropriate orthostatic blood pressure HR regulation child . The use non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring device proven increase sensitivity tilt table test child unexplained syncope10 . Indeed , BRS HRV suppress great degree subject OI . Interestingly , series child recruit pediatric cardiology clinic , majority patient ( 61 % ) diagnose neurally mediate hypotension ( NMH ) ; whereas , series , patient ( 68 % ) POTS . Therefore , proposal , patient recruit pediatric gastroenterology cardiology clinic maximize number patient respective CV dysautonomia subgroup : POTS , NMH , neurocardiogenic syncope . While fludrocortisone treatment result symptomatic relief nausea OI patient , may optimal long-term agent child OI particularly indefinite use fludrocortisone may pose musculoskeletal endocrine risk , chronic headache electrolyte problem hypokalemia 15 , 16 . The cardiovascular effect associate long-term use fludrocortisone child know , experimental data clearly implicate excess aldosterone without elevate angiotensin II increase fibrosis heart kidney cardiac hypertrophy , well hypertension 6 . Elevated level aldosterone associate secondary hypertension well impaired baroreflex sensitivity hypertensive state17 , 18 . Our preliminary finding suggest abnormality BRS tilt child POTS , improve correct fludrocortisone . Of great concern high supine MAP child POTS compare without POTS . While data show elevation supine MAP fludrocortisone treatment small sample , blood pressure elevate treatment , vasoconstrictor also empirically use treat OI elevate supine MAP 15 , 19 . However , blockade aldosterone cardiovascular benefit independent lower blood pressure 20 suggest even aldosterone elevate supine MAP , excess aldosterone may detrimental cardiovascular health . In adult , increase evidence suggest angiotensin II concentration plasma may elevate OI 21 , could contribute suppression BRS . The abnormality renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis level catecholamine adult patients12 , 21 use direct treatment , include use beta-blockers exercise tachycardia see POTS 22 Because neurohumoral profile define child , evidence-based choice medication often absent . Therefore , addition elucidate specific role sympathetic versus parasympathetic nervous system HR change difference BRS , BPV HRV tilt , believe essential good define neurohumoral characteristic patient CV dysautonomia attempt understand mechanism OI . While perform adult , describe child date23 . Perhaps , importantly , understand autonomic neurohumoral profile patient CV dysautonomia may allow direct safe treatment less risk cardiovascular side effect , exacerbation supine hypertension .</detailed_description>
