	<brief_title>Therapeutic Efficacy Tiludronic Acid Inner Ear Involvement Advanced Otosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Otosclerosis bone dystrophy localize middle inner ear unknown etiology . It principally concern adult patient 30 50 year age . Women present disease 2 time frequently men . Family case observe 50 % dominant autosomal transmission low penetrance ( 40 % ) . In early stage , disease mainly locate stapediovestibular joint lead ankylosis conductive hearing loss . In advanced stage , lesion extend around cochlea vestibule , induce sensorineural hearing loss progress severe profound deafness , prolong balance disorder . On CT-scan , disease focus show demineralization . Their density inversely correlate hearing loss . In early stage , hear function currently rehabilitate conventional hearing aid surgery . In advanced form , cochlear involvement accessible surgery , rehabilitation insure hearing aid cochlear implant . Vestibular dysfunction deal physiotherapy symptomatic treatment . Drugs anabolic activity bone , sodium fluoride etidronate ( first generation bisphosphonate , Didronel ® ) , appear reduce hear loss increase radiological density disease focus . However , efficacy low poorly document . Their effect vestibular function unknown . Moreover , ototoxicity report etidronate . New biphosphonates tiludronic acid ( Skelid ® ) significantly potent inhibition bone resorption ototoxic effect . They use treatment prevention postmenopausal osteoporosis Paget 's disease mild moderate adverse effect majority case .</detailed_description>
