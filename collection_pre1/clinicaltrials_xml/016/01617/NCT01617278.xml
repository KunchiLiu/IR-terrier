	<brief_title>I-Scan Versus High-definition White Light</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal Cancer third common cause cancer Canada estimate lifetime risk develop disease 6-7 % . Each year approximately 21,000 new case 9,100 death attributable disease . Colonoscopy one several method recommend CRC screen current guideline . While colonoscopy invasive , offer high diagnostic accuracy ability therapy ( biopsy removal adenoma ) compare modality . The emerge evidence regard miss neoplastic lesion colonoscopy result quality initiative design improve colonoscopy performance . I-Scan ( Pentax , Montvale , NJ ) new method use post processing computer algorithms revise standard white light highlight pit pattern vascular surface patterns.The relevant I-scan setting colon I-scan 1 I-scan 2 . The primary objective study compare adenoma detection rate right colon use High-definition white light colonoscopy versus I-scan enhance colonoscopy . All patient refer screen colonoscopy Forzani MacPhail Colon Cancer Centre consider enrollment.All eligible patient part another research study approach enrollment study . During pre-assessment clinic study assistant contact eligible patient describe study provide `` Invitation participate Research study '' form . The study assistant obtain final consent agree . Those interested simply receive Centre 's standard protocol . There coercion sort . Following Informed Consent , treatment allocation computer generate randomization reveal .
