	<brief_summary>Nelson 's syndrome , expand pituitary tumour , occur 30 % adults bilateral adrenalectomy Cushing 's disease , medical treatment exists . Plasma Adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) level patient remain high , characteristically deeply pigment , may experience neurological effect consequence tumour . It know whether tumour growth due lack cortisol feedback adrenalectomy whether pituitary cell preprogrammed develop tumour . There real need effective medical management Nelson 's syndrome . This especially true give increase data somewhat disappointing longterm outcome transsphenoidal surgery , increase use aparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy failure pituitary surgery even primary therapy Cushing 's disease . Therefore , likely increase number patient attend endocrine centre worldwide Nelson 's syndrome follow bilateral adrenalectomy part management Cushing 's disease . In view important investigate potential avenue treatment Nelson 's syndrome translate benefit patient . This study , design initiated investigator , assess pasireotide reduces ACTH level tumour volume patient Nelson 's syndrome . Patients recruit period 32 week receive 4 week pasireotide twice daily 24 week pasireotide long act release therapy every 4 week . Over 32 week protocol patient make 12 visit serial ACTH blood measurement 2 MRI scan assess tumour volume .</brief_summary>
