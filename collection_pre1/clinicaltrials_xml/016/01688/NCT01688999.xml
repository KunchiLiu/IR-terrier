Researchers want see cabozantinib safe effective treatment urothelial cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness cabozantinib advance urothelial cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance urothelial cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Tumor tissue sample also collect . Imaging study also perform . - Participants take cabozantinib mouth per day day 28-day cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants continue take study drug long cancer worsen side effect severe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - In United States , urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) bladder fourth common malignancy men ninth common woman estimate 69,250 new case 14,990 death year 2011 - There FDA-approved second line drug patient metastatic UC - Multiple line evidence support target angiogenesis UC - In human bladder cancer , overexpression c-Met/Axl/PDGFR-alpha c-Met alone show significant correlation poor survival - Cabozantinib new chemical entity inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinases growth-promoting angiogenic property . - The primary target cabozantinib MET , VEGFR2 , RET Objectives : - To determine response rate cabozantinib patient progressive urothelial cancer receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy Eligibility : -Patients cohort 1 must histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic , progressive urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . - Patients cohort 2 must histologically confirm diagnosis bone metastatic , urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . - Patients cohort 3 must histologically confirm diagnosis non-transitional cell carcinoma cancer ( include limit squamous cell , neuroendocrine , adenocarcinoma include urachal sarcomatoid ) bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . - Patients must previously treat , define treatment least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen agent . Patients may receive number prior cytotoxic agent . - 18 year age old . Design : - A maximum 71subjects enrol open label , non-randomized , phase II trial 60 mg day cabozantinib . Up 50 patient accrue cohort 1 ( metastatic , progressive urothelial cancer . The remainder enrol exploratory cohort 2 &amp; 3 , bone metastatic urothelial disease non TCC bladder cancer respectively , time study accrue patient cohort 1 . Note : Patients tolerate cabozantinib 60 mg daily first 2 cycle ( first restaging time period ) without ( Bullet ) grade 2 toxicity may undergo dose escalation 80 mg daily discretion Principal Investigator . - A Simon 2 stage design alpha=0.05 beta = 0.10 acceptable error probability . Initially 21 subject enrol followed progression . If 2 cohort 1 subject experience response , enrollment continue total 41 evaluable subject progressive urothelial cancer enter . 2-3 patient per month may enroll trial ; thus , 2 3 year anticipated accrual period . - Each patient undergo response evaluation assessment CAP CT ( MRI ) without Na18F PET CT every 8 week active protocol therapy start baseline . Patients undergo investigational FDG PET/CT PET/MRI ( optional ) baseline , week 4 week 8 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Cohort 1 ( urothelial progressive disease ) Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . Confirmation may obtain CLIA certified lab . Patients must progressive metastatic disease . Progressive disease define new progressive lesion crosssectional imaging . Patients must least one measurable site disease Cohort 2 ( Boneonly ) Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . Confirmation may obtain CLIA certified lab . Patients must measurable progressive disease Patient must appearance least one new bone lesion . Cohort 3 ( Rare histology ) Patient must histologically confirm diagnosis nontransitional cell carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis include limited squamous cell , neuroendocrine , adenocarcinoma include urachal sarcomatoid . Confirmation may obtain CLIA certified lab . Patients must progressive metastatic disease . Progressive disease define new progressive lesion crosssectional imaging . Patients must least one measurable site disease All cohorts Patients must previously treat , define treatment least one prior cytotoxic regimen agent . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use cabozantinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/microL Platelets great equal 75,000/ L Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) less equal 3.0 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; le equal 5.0 time ULN case liver metastasis Total serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For subject know Gilbert disease similar syndrome slow conjugation bilirubin , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal patient creatinine level 1.5 x institutional normal : creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 24 hour urine collection estimate creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min . For creatinine clearance estimation , Cockcroft Gault equation use : Male : CrCl ( mL/min ) = ( 140 age ) time wt ( kg ) / ( serum creatinine time 72 ) Female : Multiply result 0.85 Urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) less equal 2 Patient must able provide either archival tumor sample ( H &amp; E slide one paraffin block 10 unstained slide ) undergo tumor biopsy .
