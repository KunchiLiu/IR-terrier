T1 measurement allow evaluate short-term effect intervention T2 , long-term effect 1-year break intervention . Data participation questionnaire , well focus group activity report , necessary evaluation , collect trial . Expected result : With trial , investigator expect confirm effectiveness overweight obesity care management adolescent school set highlight effectiveness specific strengthen intervention adapt socially less advantaged adolescent maintain social equality access overweight obesity care .</detailed_description>
