	<brief_title>Efficacy Endoscopy Screening Esophageal Cancer China ( ESECC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Esophageal cancer ( EC ) one common invasive carcinoma China almost half new case EC worldwide find China . Hua county rural Anyang high risk area EC . The annually mortality rate EC local area 70-100/100,000 respectively . Due long asymptomatic period EC , vast majority clinical diagnose case advance stage lead fairly poor 5-year survival ( le 20 % ) . But increase 70-90 % early detection treatment . Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( UGE ) screen prove efficacious detect early EC . Screening test EC start 1970s , true beneﬁt inconsistent uncertain due lead-time bias , amount time diagnosis advance screening procedure ; length-time bias , screen likely detect slow-growing disease rather alter person 's duration life . Therefore , strong need randomize controlled trial ( RCTs ) , especially long-term RCTs , determine efﬁcacy , cost-effectiveness , adverse effect screen esophageal cancer . Aims : 1 . Establish clinical criterion population-based endoscopy screen EC high risk region China ; 2 . Evaluate efficacy endoscopy screen EC ; 3 . Determine cost-effective strategy endoscopy screen high risk population China ; 4 . Construct hazard model EC facilitate personalize screen . Study field participant 1 . This study would conduct 22 town ( higher administrative division `` village '' low `` county '' ) Hua County , Anyang , high risk area ESCC Northern China . 2 . All men woman old 45 year target villages eligible unless meet follow exclusion criterion : inability provide inform consent , history EC , contraindication UGE ( blood mediate infectious disease , cardiovascular disease mental disorder ) , severe terminal disease ; life expectancy le 5 year , UGE within previous 5 year . 3 . The total sample size least 32000 ( 16000 per group ) , equal 5-7 % total population age ≥45 year Hua County . Randomization Six hundred sixty-eight village randomly select 846 village Hua County total population range 500 3000 . All candidate village block randomized two group , namely , screen group ( 334 village ) control group ( 334 village ) ratio 1:1 . The individual sample size village determine base weight total population total population entire group . Screening procedure 1 . Participants screen arm accept standard UGE examination , , duodenum , pylorus , stomach , cardiac esophagus examine tissue specimen biopsied standard site esophagus visual abnormality detect . 2 . Participants lesion equal high severe hyperplasia advise arrange accept standard treatment Anyang Cancer Hospital local general hospital . Follow-up endpoint The onset advance EC EC-specific death adopt endpoint study . Annually face-to-face interview vital event , include experience UGE , onset cancer death , design . The information clinically diagnosed case cause-specific death would also obtain `` Cooperative medical care system '' , national health registration health-care system rural China . Nearly 100 % resident local area involve system , make ideal information source clinical diagnose case death . Statistical analysis hypothesis test 1 . The incidence advance EC EC-specific mortality compare within two group test hypothesis UGE screening would detect early stage cancer incidence advance stage EC EC-specific mortality low control group . 2 . Cost-effectiveness analysis ( cost save 1 person-year reduce 1 person-year incidence advance EC etc . ) conduct find cost-effective strategy endoscopy screen rural China . 3 . All participant combine treat one cohort . A prediction model could fit adopt cancer status ( EC/ EC ) dependent variable series potential risk factor independent variable , age , sex , family history , tobacco alcohol consumption , diet habit , nutritional status , current discomfort syndrome upper gastrointestinal well genetic marker etc . Based , one might able determine screen strategy he/she adopt well extent risk reduction he/she accept suggest screen plan .</detailed_description>
