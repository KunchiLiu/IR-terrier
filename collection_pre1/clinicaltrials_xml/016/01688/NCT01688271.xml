	<detailed_description>Study subject complete pre-course survey assess prior experience participate standardize one-day workshop comprise two session ; 1 ) didactic lecture model scan session 2 ) simulation session . Quantitative qualitative assessment perform use video analysis two blind reviewer equipment orientation ( baseline ) , follow first session , follow second session . Performance time , number attempt , composite score procedural performance ergonomics analyze within group . Every 3 month one year , subject survey assess implementation PNB practice identify remain barrier .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Anesthesiologists practice ten year ; active board certification ( American Board Anesthesiologists ) ; active license practice medicine California ; willingness spend one full day ( 8 hour ) participate standardize workshop undergo interval survey interview followup one year . Formal training ( e.g. , postgraduate fellowship ) regional anesthesia ; current practice include routine performance USguided PNB ( â‰¥10 block per month ) ; visual , hearing , communication impairment would interfere video record require substantial deviation standardize teach curriculum .</criteria>
