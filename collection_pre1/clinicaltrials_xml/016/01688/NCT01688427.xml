	<detailed_description>This study address PA-11-104 call Reducing Health Disparities among Minority Underserved Children . The Institute Medicine , World Health Organization Centers Disease Control Prevention recognize prenatal home visitation , improve well-being mother child , present opportunity provide early intervention reduce intimate partner violence ( IPV ) impact exposure child . Major challenge nurse home visitor ( HV ) accurately identify abused woman facilitate access resource need change situation . HVs often find difficult assess intervene IPV intimacy home setting . The use mHealth technology may increase sensitivity screen instrument reduce communication barrier HVs client regard IPV , well enhance implementation IPV intervention allow standard delivery intervention . Building successful trial test DOVE IPV intervention prenatal home visiting program ( NR009093 ) , propose test mHealth technology use open-source application , eMOCHA , improve assessment IPV deliver DOVE intervention . The propose eMOCHA DOVE study first ( Specific Aim/Phase 1 ) compare sensitivity specificity two different approach IPV assessment ; paper pencil versus eMOCHA mHealth technology . Phase 2 ( Aim 2 ) compare effectiveness DOVE intervention deliver standard form ( paper brochure ) versus mHealth eMOCHA DOVE application . In Phase 1 woman enrol perinatal home visit program consenting study , randomize one two assessment group assess IPV enrollment , birth 2 month post birth . Women IPV positive ( IPV+ ) assessment time re-randomized receive DOVE intervention one two approach . 1600 Medicaid eligible pregnant woman perinatal home visit program ( 800 urban Baltimore 800 rural Virginia ) recruit Phase I 400 IPV+ woman ( 200 site ) Phase II . Women participate Phase 2 receive 6 home visit intervention 6 month . Maternal outcomes related IPV mental health select infant outcome collect enrollment , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month entry Phase 2 . Specific Aim 1 use logistic linear regression model examine proportion woman experience IPV mHealth technology versus paper pencil validate assessment . Specific Aim 2 ( compare effectiveness two intervention administration ) assess logistic linear regression model categorical ( proportion abuse premature infant ) continuous outcome variable ( e.g . depression , frequency severity physical , psychological , sexual IPV , use community resource ) respectively .
