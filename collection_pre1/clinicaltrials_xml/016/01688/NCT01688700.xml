	<detailed_description>A surgical resection currently prefer treatment esophageal cancer tumor consider resectable without evidence distant metastasis . A high percentage radical resection report study use neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery versus surgery alone . The neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration paclitaxel combine cisplatin carboplatin show effectively . Nimotuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The clinical phase I study combination Nimotuzumab administer concurrently chemo-irradiation patient local advance esophageal squamous cell carcinoma show safety potential efficacy Nimotuzumab . The concurrent trial clinical phase II trial design assess efficacy combination Nimotuzumab administer concurrently neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma , investigate side-effect toxicity .</detailed_description>
