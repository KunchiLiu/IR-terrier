	<brief_summary>Background : - Pomalidomide drug alters body immune response . It may help people chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . GvHD may appear stem cell transplant , immune cell transplant try attack tissue person receive transplant . GvHD easy treat , often respond standard treatment . Researchers want see pomalidomide safe effective treatment GvHD . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness pomalidomide GvHD respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age GvHD respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample also collect . A lung function test imaging study also give . - Participants take pomalidomide capsule day 4-week period call cycle . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . Saliva sample skin mouth tissue biopsy also collect treatment . - Treatment continue six cycle ( 6 month ) , unless GvHD get bad side effect severe . If GvHD improve end six cycle , participant may able continue take pomalidomide six cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGvHD ) lead cause non-relapse morbidity mortality person allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant . - About 50 % person cGvHD disease refractory systemic corticosteroid standard second-line therapy . - Thalidomide , drug immune-modulating effect , active advance cGvHD difficult use appropriate dos . - Pomalidomide relate thalidomide high potency favorable toxicity profile . It active multiple myeloma myeloproliferative neoplasm associate myelofibrosis . Preliminary data human cGvHD encourage data limit . OBJECTIVES : - Primary : Determine whether pomalidomide effective person moderate severe cGvHD control corticosteroid . ELIGIBILITY : Inclusion Criteria - Moderate severe cGvHD per NIH criterion - Age 18 75 year old - Karnofsky performance score great equal 60 % - Has cGvHD respond high-dose corticosteroid ( average 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone great equal 8 week ) second-line therapy - Receiving stable tapering dos systemic therapy precede 4 week - Agree adhere method contraception fertility control measure prescribe protocol Exclusion Criteria - Acute GvHD ( classic late per NIH criterion ) - Absolute neutrophil &lt; 1.0x10 ( 9 ) /L , platelet &lt; 75x10 ( 9 ) /L , estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) - NIH lung score 3 - Pregnant lactate - Uncontrolled infection DESIGN : Randomized phase 2 trial single stage selection design . Patients receive either constant low dose pomalidomide ( 0.5 mg/day ) six month strategy increase dose pomalidomide 0.5 mg/d individual patient maximum tolerate dose , escalation 0.5 mg/d every 2 week maximum 2.0 mg/d . As early stopping rule futility , 7 patient enrol either arm , 0 respond , patient accrue arm soon determine . To protect patient safety , early stopping rule implement . With two arm , maximal accrual 16 patient , 32 evaluable patient randomize . Response assessment occur every 3 month primary efficacy endpoint evaluate 6 month . Patients respond disease continue therapy another 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Moderate severe cGvHD diagnose stag per NIH criterion Greater equal to1875 year age , dose adverse event data currently available use pomalidomide person great equal to18 year age Has cGvHD respond highdose corticosteroid ( average 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone &gt; 8 week ) secondline systemic therapy If take systemic therapy cGvHD time enrollment , must stable taper schedule precede 4 week ( extracorporeal photopheresis stop least 4 week enrollment ) Karnofsky performance score great equal 60 % Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Stable primary malignancy previous 3 month Agree adhere method contraception fertility control measure prescribe protocol Because agent class know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use effective form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) ( Cross ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 day prior within 24 hour start pomalidomide must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take pomalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even vasectomy . All patient must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods , AND Education Counseling Guidance Document . Male Subjects Must agree use latex condom sexual contact female childbearing potential participate study least 28 day follow discontinuation study drug even undergone successful vasectomy Will warn share study drug prohibit counseled pregnancy precaution potential risk fetal exposure Must agree abstain donate blood , semen , sperm study participation least 28 day discontinuation study drug . Must agree pregnancy positive pregnancy test occur study subject partner male study subject study participation , study drug must immediately discontinue . Patients must agree share study drug anyone participation study . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . All study participant must register mandatory POMALYST REMS ( TM ) program , willing able comply requirement POMALYST REMS ( TM ) program . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Acute GvHD , classic ( less equal day 100 ) lateonset ( &gt; day 100 ) Systemic immune suppression systemic therapy cGvHD start within precede 4 week include extracorporeal photopheresis Hypersensitivity thalidomide , lenalidomide pomalidomide Any serious medical condition place subject unacceptable risk participate study confound ability interpret data study , include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .

Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pomalidomide , breastfeed must discontinue mother take study drug least 28 day discontinuation study drug . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
