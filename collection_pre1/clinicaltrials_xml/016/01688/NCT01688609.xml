	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give lapatinib ditosylate together trastuzumab , paclitaxel , surgery work treat patient breast cancer . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change cancer stem cell ( CSC ) marker ; % CD44 variant ( CD44v ) -positive tumor cell aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 ( ALDH1 ) positivity study drug exposure concurrent preoperative chemotherapy . II . To determine pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate produce lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) + trastuzumab follow concurrent preoperative lapatinib , trastuzumab , paclitaxel chemotherapy operable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive ( HER2+ ) breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine cellular response rate produce study drug exposure and/or concurrent preoperative chemotherapy . II . To determine cutoff value baseline ratio phosphorylated HER2 ( pHER2 ) /HER2 , phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( pEGFR ) /EGFR , phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ) /ERK phosphorylated protein kinase B ( pAkt ) /Akt associate pCR . III . To assess safety tolerability study therapy Japanese woman . OUTLINE : Drug exposure : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute weekly 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Preoperative therapy : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate PO QD , trastuzumab IV 30 minute weekly , paclitaxel IV 90 minute weekly 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo lumpectomy* mastectomy* . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week . NOTE : * Patients consider candidate breast-conservation therapy ( BCT ) offer lumpectomy . Patients consider candidate BCT desire BCT undergo total mastectomy .</detailed_description>
