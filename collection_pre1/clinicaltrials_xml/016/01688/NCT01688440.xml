	<brief_summary>When baby sick , bear prematurely , sometimes need endotracheal ( ET ) tube assist breathing and/or nasal canula . The investigator must periodically irrigate ET tube prevent plug secretion . The investigator also , due dry effect nasal canula , periodically moisten nasal passage baby . Presently 0.9 % saline solution use moisten ET tube , nose , well oral care infant eating . However , scientist recently learn saline destroy body 's natural antibacterial property windpipe , nose , mouth . The investigator develop new solution use place saline endotracheal ( ET ) , nasal , oral care . The investigator ' new solution pattern natural fluid windpipe , nose , mouth . Study Hypothesis : 1 . Patients receive ETCare increase adverse event related administration , compare 0.9 % saline . 2 . Patients receive ETCare low proportion tracheal aspirate pathogen report . 3 . Patients receive ETCare low proportion tracheal aspirate leukocyte report . 4 . Patients receive ETCare fewer ( risk-adjusted ) day supplemental oxygen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal saline ( 0.9 % sodium chloride ) use virtually neonatal intensive care unit periodically irrigate endotracheal tube neonate require mechanical ventilation . This practice intend reduce risk thick secretion occlude endotracheal tube . Normal saline also occasionally use periodically clear nasal passage neonates nasal CPAP nasal canula oxygen . It also occasionally used mean periodically moisten mouth neonate endotracheal tube place , tube prevents lip apposition result dry mouth . The problem current method use normal saline periodic endotracheal , nasal , and/or oral care high concentration sodium chloride recently find rapidly completely inactivate natural antimicrobial property tracheal effluent , nasal secretion , saliva . Tracheal secretion , nasal secretion , saliva contain potent antibacterial substance . One recently describe 37 amino acid peptide widespread antimicrobial property , term `` LL-37 '' . It recently show 0.9 % saline inactivate antimicrobial property LL-37 significantly damage overall antibacterial action tracheal secretion , nasal secretion , saliva . Further research show high sodium chloride content saliva patient cystic fibrosis inactivate antimicrobial property , thus partly explain high incidence airway infection patient . Moreover , family deficient LL-37 describe Sweden , individual chronic gingivostomatitis airway infection . Therefore , current practice instill 0.9 % sodium chloride likely inactivate major innate anti-microbial defense system upper airway . Perhaps reduce immune capacity upper airway practice unwittingly contribute high incidence upper airway infection among intubated neonate .</detailed_description>
