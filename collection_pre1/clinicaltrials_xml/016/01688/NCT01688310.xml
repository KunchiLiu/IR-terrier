	<detailed_description>Voluntary medical male circumcision ( VMMC ) priority preventive intervention Mozambique priority country VMMC scale-up . PEPFAR recently estimate one HIV infection would prevent 2025 every seven circumcision perform Mozambique . Sofala Province , study conduct , HIV prevalence 13 % among men 18 % among woman .

'' This propose randomized control trial provide important data inform enable Mozambican government PEPFAR effectively scale-up circumcision service . The investigator postulate VMMC use Gomco clamp couple tissue adhesive meet WHO criteria ideal method : much easy learn , fast , safe surgeon patient , heals sooner , cost effective currently available technique . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) compare minimally-invasive circumcision technique open surgical technique : - Gomco clamp tissue adhesive : 100 men - Open surgical circumcision : 100 men The Gomco clamp FDA-approved device widely use US , data use Africa . Tissue adhesive widely use multiple area medicine ; specifically , multiple observational study RCTs show cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives superior suture closure circumcision boy . The investigator refer Gomco clamp circumcision couple tissue adhesive 'new ' technique two independently-validated component couple observational study among men , randomize control trial among pre-pubertal boy , never RCT among adult men . The open surgical method PEPFAR-approved serve control intervention . Population : Men &gt; 18 year age desire male circumcision Sample size : 200 ( 100 men group ) Study design : Randomized control trial Intervention : Gomco clamp circumcision plus tissue adhesive vs. open surgical circumcision Follow-up visit : 2 day , 7 day , 14 day 28 day .
