	<brief_summary>Acute radiation skin reaction ( ARSR ) occur majority patient undergo postoperative radiotherapy ( RT ) . Some patient experience severe reaction dry and/or moist desquamation patient experience mild reaction e.g . erythema ( Lopez et al. , 2005 ) . The radiation dose , volume , RT technique previous treatment , type surgery previous chemotherapy , factor might impact risk ARSR together patient-related factor body mass index ( BMI ) , smoke status previous skin damage ( Porock et al. , 1998 ; Wells et al. , 2004 ) . In pilot study ( n=93 ) frequency ARSR patient breast cancer underwent adjuvant RT show 93 % developed ARSR , mostly mild reaction . Patients report low score pain itch ( Sharp et al. , 2011 ) . Over 80 % patient report adherence skin care recommendation include application thin layer Essex® cream , non-perfumed aqueous cream , irradiated area least two time day ( Sharp et al. , 2011 ) . The effect skin care product contain Calendula Officinalis ( marigold plant ) ARSR patient breast cancer investigate randomize clinical trial ( Pommier et al. , 2004 ) . Patients experimental group , treat calendula cream statistically significant low incidence severe ARSR , pain treatment interruption comparison patient control group , treat trolamine . The purpose blind , randomize clinical trial compare two topical agent , Calendula Weleda® cream Essex® cream , term efficacy reduce risk severe acute radiation skin reaction ( ARSR ) relation adjuvant radiotherapy ( RT ) breast cancer . Patients instruct apply thin layer assign cream twice day , start onset RT continue two week termination , ARSR heal . The application include whole treatment area include armpit shoulder/back area patient treat modified radical mastectomy . Patients also advise apply cream within two hour RT order avoid possible build-up effect . Daily wash perfume free soap tap water recommend patient advise refrain use topical agent irradiated area . The primary endpoint efficacy reduce acute radiation skin reaction ( ARSR ) , assess Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization Research Treatment Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ( RTOG/EORTC scale ) follow-up . Secondary endpoint include patient report outcome measure ; Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) , Sleep disturbance ( MOS-sleep questionnaire ) symptom experience irradiated area ( visual analogue scale ) . Patients ' experience adherence topical agent also evaluate . A total 400 patient required detect true absolute reduction proportion patient ARSR , 35 % standard treatment ( Essex® cream ) 20 % experimental treatment ( Calendula Weleda® cream ) , significance level 5 % power 90 % . With sample size , 95 % confidence interval difference proportion estimate order ±10 % . Assuming rate 5 % non-responders , target size set 420 patient .</brief_summary>
