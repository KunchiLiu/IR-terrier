	<brief_summary>The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry ( EPR ) Health Exposure Survey design gather health , family history disease , environmental exposure lifestyle data adult EPR subject . The EPR registry establish collect store DNA sample 20,000 volunteer North Carolina serve resource scientist investigate genotype-driven translational research chronic condition . Under new protocol , administer health exposure survey EPR subject . The information collect survey use well characterize EPR population thus make useful NIEHS researcher . The survey contain approximately 200 question . Data survey help researcher develop hypothesis , design follow-up study , select appropriate subject . The survey administer EPR subject use modified version Dillman Total Design Method ( TDM ) survey . This method require follow specific time-dependent step survey administration incorporate self- phone administration type phone mail contact . The goal TDM maximize subject response rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry ( EPR ) Health Exposure Survey design collect health , family history disease , environmental exposure lifestyle data EPR participant . The EPR establish collect store DNA specimens 20,000 participant serve resource scientist investigate genotype-driven translational research chronic health condition . Under protocol , administer approximately 200 question Health Exposure Survey EPR participant . The information use well characterize EPR population , thus make useful answer research question relate gene-environment interaction . Data survey help researcher advance clinical research develop new way preventing , diagnose , treat common disease cardiovascular disease , asthma , diabetes . During Phases I II , survey administer EPR participant use modified version Dillman Total Design Method ( TDM ) survey . This method require follow specific step survey administration incorporate web-based , paper phone administration . The rationale use TDM maximize participant response rate . During Phase III , survey may distribute new EPR participant ( e.g. , enrol EPR time Phase I II survey administration ) self-administration time enrollment . Investigators may select contact participant follow-up study base upon health , exposure , disease status information ; include response EPR Health Exposure Survey . Participation follow-up study completely voluntary . Participants decide time contact would like enroll follow-up study . Their decision whether participate follow-up study affect participation EPR .</detailed_description>
