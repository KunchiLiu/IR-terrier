	<brief_title>Tivantinib With Without Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Advanced Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( confirm complete partial response ) patient locally advance metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treat either ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) ARQ 197 combine erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) patient locally advance metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treat either ARQ 197 ARQ 197 combine erlotinib . II . To assess safety tolerability ARQ 197 therapy ARQ 197 combine erlotinib . III . To descriptively assess role prior treatment outcome . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank tissue specimens future use funding obtain evaluate expression tissue correlative biomarkers hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( c-MET ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , perform exploratory correlation clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive tivantinib PO BID erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
