	<detailed_description>Preterm birth continue provide great challenge perinatal health care develop world . It syndrome involve multiple cause arise number social , psychological , biological determinant . It estimate intrauterine infection account least 25-40 % spontaneous preterm birth , infection primary cause extreme prematurity . Because infection-mediated preterm delivery mainly occur young gestational age ( less 28 week ) , extremely premature baby risk associate born early , also likely severe morbidity associate infection . Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) define loss significant depletion lactobacillus couple overgrowth pathogenic bacteria increase vaginal pH ( &gt; 4.5 ) . BV common occur 20 % general female population , often without symptom associate 40 % increase risk preterm birth . The clinical finding lactobacillus dominant microbe vagina woman healthy pregnancy full term delivery , support association specie healthy pregnancy . BV associated elevation cervico-vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokine include IL-1Î² IL-8 also associate preterm labour ; initiate inflammatory cascade event involve labour may mechanism BV trigger preterm birth . However , woman BV deliver preterm suggest variation genetic susceptibility may underlie host response presence BV risk preterm birth . Antibiotic therapy current treatment BV , extent antibiotic prevent preterm birth woman BV remain somewhat uncertain , conflict result publish literature . The apparent ineffective nature antibiotic therapy , perhaps due lack regrowth lactobacillus follow treatment , possibility pathogen already induced inflammatory process eventually induce preterm birth , emphasize need continue investigate role microbes pregnancy . Probiotics suggest alternative antibiotic therapy restore vaginal lactobacillus reverse BV . The study seek determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus , GR-1 Lactobacillus reuteri , RC-14 administer pregnant woman diagnose bacterial vaginosis intermediate flora reverse condition lead decrease inflammatory mediator involve cascade infection/inflammation-mediated preterm birth .</detailed_description>
