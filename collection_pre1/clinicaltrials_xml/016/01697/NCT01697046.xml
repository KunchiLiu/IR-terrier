	<brief_summary>This pilot , open label study involve 65 participant . All participant follow seroconversion last enrol participant completes one year follow-up , whichever happen first . Participant study number give screen visit , prior inclusion study . The chosen intervention study regimen base dynamic viral infection pharmacokinetics study drug . In order inhibit reverse transcription nucleoside nucleotide analogue need phosphorylated intracellularly . On hand , available data indicate take approximately 10 hour exposure HIV viral integration , offer window opportunity Raltegravir block integration thus prevent infection , give drug need metabolize exert effect . The intervention maintain 4 week follow exposure , accordance Brazilian CDC guideline PEP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Raltegravir , Tenofovir Emtricitabine Peri-exposure Prophylaxis HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects report high-risk behavior ( anticipated future high-risk behavior ) exposure immediate past focus study . Participants prescribe raltegravir 400 mg BID + Truvada daily . All study participant receive 4-days starter pack . Study participant instruct start study drug expect experience exposure mucous membrane ( oral , urethral , anal ) semen . Subjects expect experience exposure instruct take 1 pill Raltegravir 400mg one pill truvada , follow second dose Raltegravir 12 hour later . From second day onward , participant instruct take Raltegravir 400 mg BID + Truvada daily . The first dose take 6 hour 6 hour expect actual exposure continue 28 day . Enrolled subject also instruct report study site within 4 day begin study drug respond CASI questionnaire blood take . They instruct return end 4-week chemoprophylaxis course reevaluation give another 4-day supply medication . Under circumstance participant give great 4 week supply medication ; evaluate toxicity adherence follow course chemoprophylaxis . The study participant monitor closely safety course chemoprophylaxis end trial . In addition , subject instruct immediately contact site experience certain symptom consistent severe toxicity . At evaluation careful clinical history , physical examination , laboratory assessment , include HIV serology , complete . Adherence estimate base self-report use pill count . During visit , subject remind need increase high-risk sexual behavior . HIV serology response CASI questionnaire conduct monthly .</detailed_description>
