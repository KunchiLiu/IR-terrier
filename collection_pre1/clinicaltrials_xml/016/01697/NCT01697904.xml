	<brief_summary>Preterm infant born immature lung often require help breathing shortly birth . This traditionally involve administer 100 % oxygen . Unfortunately , delivery high oxygen concentration lead production free radical injure many organ system . Term near-term newborn deprive oxygen prior birth respond well good resuscitation room air ( 21 % oxygen ) compare 100 % oxygen . However , static concentration 21 % oxygen may inappropriate preterm infant lung disease.Purpose study investigate preterm neonate resuscitation initiate 21 % fiO2 adjust meet transitional goal saturation ( Limited oxygen strategy LOX ) would less oxidative stress measure oxidative balance ratio biological antioxidant potential/total hydroperoxide compare infant resuscitation initiate pure oxygen titrate targeted saturation 85-94 % ( Traditional oxygen strategy TOX ) . Secondary outcomes interest include need delivery room resuscitation measure , respiratory support ventilation/oxygenation status upon neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) admission , survival hospital discharge , bronchopulmonary dysplasia short-term morbidity .</brief_summary>
