	<brief_summary>Local control hepatic metastasis appear major determinant overall survival . However , many patient suitable resection due medical surgical reason . Therefore , important role treatment provide equivalent tumor resection minimal morbidity . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) delivers ablative regimen highly focus external beam radiotherapy target one discrete extracranial lesion . Published report use SBRT treat liver metastases show actuarial local control rate range 50-100 % high dos associate well local control . In patient metastatic liver disease , aggressive local therapy use modern radiotherapy technique promise project substantial role treatment metastatic liver cancer treat unresectable disease . The dosimetric advantage proton therapy may lead improved clinical outcome less morbidity , however , clinical data confirm assertion . We thus propose phase I study determine feasibility safety stereotactic body proton therapy patient liver metastasis follow phase II study determine efficacy treatment local control .</brief_summary>
