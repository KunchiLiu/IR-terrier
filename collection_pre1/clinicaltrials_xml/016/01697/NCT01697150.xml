	<brief_summary>Automated closed-loop control ( CLC ) blood glucose , know `` artificial pancreas '' ( AP ) tremendous impact health live people type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . The investigator inter-institutional international research team forefront CLC development since begin JDRF Artificial Pancreas initiative 2006 . Thus far , investigator conduct three closed-loop control clinical trial ( total 60 subject T1DM ) , demonstrate significantly time acceptable `` target '' blood glucose range CLC , significantly few hypoglycemic event CLC compare open loop . The investigator overall objective sequentially test , validate , obtain regulatory approval , deploy home , closed-loop Control-to-Range ( CTR ) system comprise two algorithmic component : Safety Supervision Module ( SSM ) Hypoglycemia Mitigation Module ( HMM ) . The SSM monitor safety subject 's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump ( CSII ) prevent hypoglycemia also monitor integrity continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) data signal sensor deviation loss sensitivity . The HMM responsible optimal regulation postprandial hyperglycemic excursion correction bolus . This study test ability AP Platform ( 1 ) run CTR outpatient setting , ( 2 ) remotely monitor . Specifically , study involve study adult T1DM experience insulin pump user . Subjects spend two night ( -42 hour ) local hotel , AP Platform remotely monitor adjacent hotel room validation remote system monitor successfully occur . During study , study subject responsible . operate CTR system nursing technician available</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I.A . PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES 1 . Primary objective The purpose pilot study test closed-loop Control-to-Range ( CTR ) system semi-controlled environment especially evaluate system accurately collect data come patient input , insulin pump , continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device 80 % time use . 2 . Secondary objective This pilot study use Artificial Pancreas Platform ( AP Platform ) cell phone/phone-based system test outpatient controller remote monitoring follow : - test CTR system remotely monitor nurses/physicians/ technician confirm appropriate functioning outside hospital set - test CTR system deploy , appropriate subject response , outside hospital set I.B . STUDY DESIGN This study early feasibility pilot trial principal goal validate initial outpatient ready CTR system remote-monitoring capability . Therefore , unblinded pilot study control group use .</detailed_description>
