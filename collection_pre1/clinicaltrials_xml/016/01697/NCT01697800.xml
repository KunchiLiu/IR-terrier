	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) lethal solid malignancy 5 year survival estimate approximately 50 % , associate high rate systemic immune impairment well evasion tumor specific immune response . Preclinical clinical data show PDE5 inhibitor ( tadalafil ) use augment immune function HNSCC patient inhibition cancer-induced myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) . A multi site phase II , randomize , prospective , biomarker endpoint trial determine optimum timing design PDE5 antitumor immunotherapy ( tadalafil ) conjunction conventional therapy HNSCC . 40 patient biopsy proven HNSCC randomize receive tadalafil ( n=25 ) placebo ( n=15 ) least 10-14 day start conventional therapy continue 90 day completion conventional therapy . Tumor-specific T cell response assess use HNSCC cell line , blood collect initiation tadalafil/placebo 60 90 day completion conventional therapy . Number function MDSC Treg cell assess 60 90 day completion conventional therapy . Prevnar 13® vaccine administer 10-14 day commence tadalafil/placebo ( conventional therapy begin ) 60 day completion conventional therapy . Vaccine-specific response assess 60 90 day post-conventional therapy use measure ability tadalafil augment immune response vaccine .</brief_summary>
