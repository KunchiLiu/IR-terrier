	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : ALTENS technique , administer within first 3 month radiation completion , improve radiation-induced dysphagia associate symptom head neck cancer patient . This beneficial effect mediate reduction chronic inflammatory response swallow musculature radiation , consequently reduction muscle fibrosis . Primary study objective : To evaluate effectiveness ALTENS relieve radiation-induced dysphagia . Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10 ) score use primary study endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study ALTENS Improving Dysphagia Induced IMRT Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Difficulty swallow concern symptom radiation treatment type head neck cancer . Swallowing becomes difficult radiation damage induces inflammation ( swell pain ) inner cover tissue throat muscle involve swallow process . Currently , supportive measure use manage symptom wait tissue damage heal . In patient , inflame muscle develop scar tissue cause long-term swallowing difficulty narrow swallowing passage . Needle acupuncture may help reduce tissue inflammation may lessen severity swallow difficulty . However , needle puncture often desire patient . Acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( ALTENS ) like acupuncture treatment , acupuncture point stimulate mild electrical stimulation without needle , simplify treatment delivery . This study examine pre-selected set acupuncture point treat use ALTENS reduce swallow difficulty . There total 12 treatment give 6 8 week . Changes severity swallow difficult treatment assess use 2 subjective assessment tool .</detailed_description>
