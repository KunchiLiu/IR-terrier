	<brief_summary>The investigator propose compare two different treatment , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) versus breathe atmospheric pressure , subject obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) recover weight loss surgery post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . WE hypothesize subject OSA high Apnea-Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) desaturation investigator expect post-operative CPAP treatment PACU significantly improve AHI therefore improve patient safety PACU . The investigator also hypothesize subject OSA great decrease oxygen saturation response opioid administration patient-controlled opioid analgesia ( PCA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients morbid obesity approximately 60-80 percent incidence OSA depend criterion use make diagnosis , suggest increase risk develop serious perioperative complication , especially postoperative period . Weight loss might consider appropriate treatment OSA turn recently report OSA independent risk factor development perioperative complication , importantly oxygen desaturation , patient undergo weight loss surgery . It seem logical evaluate patient would benefit post-operative CPAP treatment PACU . The result multidisciplinary study impact PACU treatment patient OSA optimize patient care MGH .</detailed_description>
