	<brief_summary>Several recent study examine feasibility benefit nonoperative treatment perforate appendicitis child . One study show trend toward longer operative time patient randomized immediate appendectomy , overall advantage . In another large study , cost delay appendectomy perforate appendicitis high - part related readmission interval ( 6-8 week ) . Nevertheless , study demonstrate safety delay appendectomy perforate appendicitis . Emergency appendectomy well-established approach , postoperative recovery child fast . Nevertheless , onset symptom hospital stay postoperative recovery , appendicitis cause disruption family 's normal routine ( absence school work ) 1-2 week . Because unplanned operation , patient wait operate room become available , elective operation place hold accommodate emergency operation . Each year , 250 child undergo appendectomy HCH . This represent 250 episode emergency surgery , one emergency add-on operation per work day . If initial trial antibiotic safe treatment appendicitis , convert emergency operation elective , scheduled outpatient procedure may reduce stress disruption routine patient family - may allow good operating room planning health care professional hospital . The investigator hypothesize initial antibiotic treatment acute ( non-perforated ) appendicitis , follow schedule outpatient appendectomy , reduce overall cost treat disease result great patient family satisfaction . This pilot study aim establish safety feasibility treat acute appendicitis intravenous antibiotic , follow outpatient oral antibiotic . Patients family offer possibility initial nonoperative treatment subsequent outpatient elective appendectomy nonrandomized , single arm study .</brief_summary>
