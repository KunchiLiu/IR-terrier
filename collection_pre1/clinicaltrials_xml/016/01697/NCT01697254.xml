	<brief_title>The CARRA Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol represent one aim large clinical project advance infrastructure Childhood Arthritis Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) network , facilitate expand clinical translational pediatric research , rapidly transform culture pediatric rheumatology toward universal participation research . Through creation sophisticated informatics infrastructure , provision comprehensive site support engagement family , patient , community , CARRA provide opportunity affect child every CARRA site participate high quality clinical translational research . The large clinical project include development CARRA-wide informatics platform capability capture , storage , visualization , secure HIPAA-compliant sharing validate disease metric relevant subject demographic , utilize centralize Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) phone interview appropriate , ontology-based data storage use distributed database structure base NIH-supported i2b2 ( Informatics Integrating Biology Bedside ) framework . This enable efficient , observational , disease-related data capture across CARRA site . The CARRA Registry describe protocol form foundational database involve capture data include pediatric rheumatic disease describe Appendix A . The CARRA Registry support data collection use consensus treatment plan ( CTPs ) , clinical trial , observational disease registry , comparative effectiveness research , research patient pediatric rheumatic disease . The CARRA Registry form basis future CARRA study Duke Clinical Research Institute ( DCRI ) serve CARRA Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) protocol .</detailed_description>
