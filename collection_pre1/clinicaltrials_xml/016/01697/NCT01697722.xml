	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline UK underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent le 10 % United Kingdom 's ( UK 's ) asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There therefore need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . The fixed combination asthma inhaler , FP/SAL ( Seretide ) BUD/FOR ( Symbicort ) indicate use asthma adequate asthma control achieve low/medium dose ICS therapy as-needed ( prn ) reliever therapy ( short-acting beta-agonist [ SABA ] ) . Fixed combination inhaler also indicate patient already adequately control separate ICS/LABA therapy . However , emerge trend asthma prescribe indicate increase use add-on therapy ( particularly form combination inhaler ) early stage asthma therapy , even first-line therapy . In practice , significant pressure ( support asthma guideline ) use least expensive , effective inhaled therapy available . While effect increase use add-on combination therapy term patient benefit remain uncertain , impact UK 's National Health Service ( NHS ) treatment cost unequivocal . Short , randomise trial effectiveness asthma monotherapies demonstrate extrafine HFA-BDP least effective half dose BDP pMDI , equivalent same-dose FP pMDI . There also evidence suggest extrafine HFA-BDP optimises deposition lung affords great tolerance poor coordination breathe inhaler actuation . In addition , one long-term , prospective , randomised , open-labelled trial compare extrafine HFA-BDP BDP course one year demonstrate great improvement symptom-free day quality life extrafine HFA-BDP treatment group , low cost per symptom-free day . The hypothesis study , therefore , extrafine HFA-BDP may suitable , cost-effective , alternative combination therapy ( fix separate inhaler ) child adult evidence persistent asthma .</detailed_description>
