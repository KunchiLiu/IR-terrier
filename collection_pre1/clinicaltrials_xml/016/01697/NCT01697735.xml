	<brief_title>The Therapeutic Effects Statins Berberine Hyperlipemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) often prescribed statin , medication reduce amount cholesterol blood . By lower cholesterol level , patient low incidence coronary artery disease , ischemic stroke , peripheral arterial disease . But many patient whose hyperlipemia well controlled.If investigator simply double statin , 6 % benefit received.And often bring significant side effect elder patient . Several study suggest use berberine effectively lower blood lipids.The chemical structure mechanisms drug clearly , side effect seldom , price berberine cheap . The purpose study observe therapeutic effect combination statin berberine patient hyperlipemia whose level lipid well control use statin . This study enroll patient currently take cholesterol-lowering medications，but level lipid control well . Patients assign receive 500mg Berberine twice day ( meanwhile take 20mg Atorvastatin daily 8 week 10mg Rosuvastatin daily 8 week ) . Investigators occur baseline Weeks 4 8 . Blood collect laboratory testing , standardized psychological questionnaire assess fatigue baseline week 4 8 . Pill count use assess adherence Berberine statins treatment week 4 8 . At week 4 8 , medication side effect monitor test alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) creatine phosphate kinase ( CPK ) perform . At week 4 8 , medication efficacy assess test low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) perform .</detailed_description>
