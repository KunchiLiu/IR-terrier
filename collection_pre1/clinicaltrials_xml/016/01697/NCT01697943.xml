	<detailed_description>Total gastrectomy indicate mainly advanced gastric cancer locate upper middle third stomach multiple gastric cancers.The common method create way food call `` Roux-en-Y '' , one part intestine connect end esophagus ( swallow tube ) abdomen , another connection make intestine ' low . Patients total gastrectomy suffer poor food intake , anemia , poor digestion loss gastric reservoir lack normal hormonal secretion digestion . It often associate limitation postoperative quality life ( QOL ) . To improve postoperative nutritional status QOL , surgeon try establish ideal reconstruction total gastrectomy optimum procedure reconstruction discuss . This study compare postoperative quality life ( QOL ) gastric pouch reconstruction usual reconstruction see pouch make patient feel well .</detailed_description>
