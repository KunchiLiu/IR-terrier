	<brief_summary>This phase II trial examine whether genetically reprogramming patient 's disease fight white blood cell may build immune response kill cancer cell express NY-ESO-1 protein . In study , genetic therapy give stem cell transplant along vaccine therapy . The vaccine make use NY-ESO-1 protein may help stimulate engineer immune response tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether safely administer NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor transduce autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ( 1x10^9 cell ) along NY-ESO-1 dendritic cell vaccine low dose IL-2 patient advanced malignancy . II . To evaluate feasibility deliver two patient-specific cell therapy , NY-ESO-1 TCR transgenic peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) peptide pulse dendritic cell ( DC ) , within technically challenge study design require significant intervention , like lymphodepleting condition regimen post-infusion subcutaneous low dose interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) . III . To determine rate objective tumor response , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) objective response criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine persistence NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered cell . This determine temporally analyze peripheral blood sample presence T cell transduce NY-ESO-1 TCR tetramer dextramer analysis . II . To explore home persistence adoptively transfer NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered PBMC secondary lymphoid organ tumor deposit via positron emission tomography ( PET ) -based image use PET tracer fluorodeoxyglucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -5 -4 fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -4 -1 . TRANSPLANT : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 TCR transduce autologous PBMC IV day 0 . Patients also receive NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) peptide pulse dendritic cell vaccine therapy intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 14 , 30 aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Patients may receive 3 additional dos NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) peptide pulse dendritic cell vaccine therapy day 90 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 day ; every 3 month 2 year ; every 6 month 3 year ; annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
