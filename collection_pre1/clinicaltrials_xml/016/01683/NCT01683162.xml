	<brief_summary>Previous study suggest olive oil-based emulsion safe well tolerated preterm infant , show efficacy good clinical biological safety profile . The objective study ass effect new olive-oil base lipid emulsion compare traditional lipid emulsion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Parenteral Nutrition With Different Lipid Emulsions Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For number year , lipid emulsion use nutritional support surgical critically ill patient , aim supply substrate meet energy demand provide building block wound heal tissue repair . Two type lipid emulsion currently use adult well pediatric patient : one lipid emulsion prepared soybean oil compose long-chain triacylglycerols ( LCTs ) , 62 % polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) , lipid emulsion compose 50 % medium-chain triacylglycerols ( MCTs ) 50 % LCT soybean oil . A new lipid emulsion prepared mixture soybean oil olive oil contains LCTs low proportion ( 20 % ) PUFAs 60 % monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFAs ) . There many investigation olive oil-based emulsion include in-vitro study , animal study , infusion study healthy subject various patient group . In-vitro animal study demonstrate impairment immune function , especially T cell response , occur soybean oil-based emulsion avoid ClinOleic . Studies infant adult consistently show olive oil-based emulsion increase oleic acid content blood lipid avoids depletion long chain n-6 PUFA derivative linoleic acid see soybean oil-based emulsion . The less unsaturated nature olive oil-based emulsion compare possibly decrease oxidative stress . Further study require test beneficial effect olive oil consumption preterm infant . The investigator design double-blind , randomize clinical trial perform effect lipometabolism , oxidative stress clinical outcome olive oil , MCY/LCT LCT lipid emulsion .</detailed_description>
