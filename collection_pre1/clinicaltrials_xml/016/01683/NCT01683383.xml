	<detailed_description>Statement Problem : Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) remain major cause death severe disability despite advance neonatal perinatal medicine . Therapeutic hypothermia single promising intervention HIE . Reduction brain temperature 2° 5°C show neuroprotective newborn adult animal model brain ischemia . Therapeutic hypothermia institute within 6 hour birth show significantly improve survival neurodevelopmental outcome term newborn HIE . Hypothermia effective begin latent period , secondary energy failure . It know whether cool initiate 6 hour age effective . Animal study show sooner initiation cooling , good outcome . They also suggest latent period may shorter severe insult . Cooling initiate soon possible , preferably within 2 hour later 6 hour . There six large randomize clinical trial support efficacy therapeutic hypothermia HIE standard care U.S. internationally . Once patient qualifies cool , whole body cool selective head cool initiate . However , birth hospital ability provide therapeutic hypothermia ; thus , patient must transport Level 3 NICUs specially equip provide therapy . As limited therapeutic window induction hypothermia , would ideal initiate therapeutic hypothermia soon patient qualifies cool therapy . If cooling initiate birth hospital , neuroprotective temperature achieve several hour prior arrival cool center . At time patient cool transport receive passive cooling ( turn active warming device transport isolette ) active cooling ( ice pack place around baby ) . These practice show present significant risk over-cooling under-cooling . The risk associate excessive cool include bradycardia , cardiac arrest , coagulation disturbance . Undercooling likely result reduce efficacy neuroprotective effect provide therapeutic hypothermia . Primary secondary endpoint Primary end point : The percentage temperatures target range ( 33°-34°C ) within enrol infant cool initiation transport team . Secondary end point : Time target temperature range ( 33°-34°C ) , percentage newborn target temperature range one hour cool initiation transport team , temperature range . Study Design The propose California Transport Cooling Trial ( CTCT ) prospective randomize multi-center clinical trial conduct nine transport team base level III NICUs California perform therapeutic hypothermia HIE . The on-call neonatologist participate cool center determine infant qualifies cool . Infants great equal 35 week less six hour age transport cool center eligible . The transport team randomize infant either cool per center practice ( Arm 1 ) device-regulated cooling ( Arm 2 ) . Subjects Arm 1 receive passive active cool per center practice rectal temperature record every 15 minute . Subjects Arm 2 place cool blanket connect Tecotherm Neo . Temperature monitor continuously servo-regulated use rectal temperature probe . Pertinent clinical data collect use CPQCC/CPeTS data form CTCT data form . Temperatures initiation cool admission cool center analyze percentage temperature target range cool initiation transport team , time target temperature range , percentage newborn target temperature range 1 hour cool initiation transport team , temperature range . ANOVA method use compare temperature range across arm . Cox proportional hazard model use compare time target temperature . Safety outcomes compare use standard logistic regression . Study Methods Subjects assign Arm 1 cool per usual center practice record rectal temperature every 15 minute . Arm 2 subject cool use portable servo-regulated cooling device use rectal probe . Temperatures store memory card every minute . No PHI store cool device . Data download device conclusion transport . Sample Size Estimated Study Duration Power calculation study base anticipated 140 patient require initiation therapeutic hypothermia nine transport team period one year . A 70 % consent rate 50 patient per arm provide 90 % power detect 30 % absolute difference percentage temperature target range assume standard deviation percentage temperature target range 45 % base Kendall study , publish Archives Diseases Childhood 2010 . All analyse adjust center two-sided conduct 0.05 level significance . We estimate patient enrollment take approximately one year . Data analysis , manuscript preparation , submission complete within 6 month completion enrollment .</detailed_description>
