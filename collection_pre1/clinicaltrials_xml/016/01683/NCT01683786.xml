	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare effectiveness 36 week versus 48 week pegintron plus ribavirin treatment hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) patient without rapid virologic response ( RVR ) , undetectable HCV RNA wk 8 . Study Design : multi-site , prospective , open label , randomize , pilot trial . Approximately 60 HCV Genotype 1 patient fail achieve RVR achieve undetectable HCV RNA week 8 ( &lt; 50 IU/ml ) recruit 2 arm ( 30 arm ) . Patients must receive pegylated interferon-α2b 1.5 μg/kg body weight/week ribavirin 800~1400 mg/day 12 wks enter study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To compare effectiveness 36 wks versus 48 wks pegintron plus ribavirin treatment HCV patient without RVR , undetectable HCV RNA wk 8 . Study Design : This multi-site , prospective , open label , randomize , pilot trial . Approximately 60 HCV Genotype 1 patient fail achieve RVR wk 4 achieve undetectable HCV RNA wk 8 ( &lt; 50 IU/ml ) recruit 2 arm ( 30 arm ) . Patients must receive pegylated IFN-α2b 1.5 μg/kg body weight/week ribavirin 800~1400 mg/day 12 wks enter study . Study Duration : The estimated recruitment period 12 month ; follow-up duration 72 week ( long treatment period plus 6 month- f/u period ) ; total study duration ( FPE- &gt; LPLV ) estimate 2.5 year Statistical Analysis Sample Size Justification : A . The study primarily design hypothesis test ; thus sample size calculation base primary objective , Approximately 60 subject ( 30 arm ) recruit study B . For descriptive statistic , continuous variable express mean ± standard deviation , categorical variable perform number case correspond percentage . The primary analysis focus efficacy response shorten HCV treatment course ( 36 wks ) compare standard course ( 48 wks ) . The between-group difference efficacy endpoint assess difference percentage virologic responder 24 wks HCV treatment . For univariate analysis , comparison independent sample ( shorten vs. standard course ) assess Student 's test . The comparison categorical variable assess use chi-square test . Regarding multivariate analysis , proportion patient achieve virologic responder compare among group use logistic regression analysis term potential confounding factor . The OR estimate derive logistic regression model correspond 95 % CIs use quantify effect treatment course length confound factor . All randomized patient take least one dose HCV regimen include safety assessment . Fisher 's exact test use compare between-group incidence AEs . For patient clinical AEs , treatment related AEs , serious AEs , discontinuation AEs , data among group provide well . Statistical significance determine 0.05 level test .</detailed_description>
