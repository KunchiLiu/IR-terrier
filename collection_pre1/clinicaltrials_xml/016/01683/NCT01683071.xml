	<brief_title>Femoral Nerve Block With Liposome Bupivacaine Postsurgical Analgesia Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2/3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging study subject undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) general spinal anesthesia . Note : Bupivacaine use spinal anesthetic . Part 1 During Part 1 study , approximately 100 subject ( 25 per treatment arm ) randomize receive single dose injection femoral nerve block either one three dose liposome bupivacaine ( 67 , 133 , 266 mg ) placebo 20 mL ultrasound guidance . Preservative-free normal saline add 67 mg 133 mg dos study drug achieve volume 20 mL . Part 2 In Part 2 study , approximately 180 subject ( randomized 1:1 , result approximately 90 liposome bupivacaine subject 90 placebo subject ) receive single dose injection femoral nerve block select dose level liposome bupivacaine ( i.e. , 67 , 133 , 266 mg ) placebo 20 mL ultrasound guidance .</detailed_description>
