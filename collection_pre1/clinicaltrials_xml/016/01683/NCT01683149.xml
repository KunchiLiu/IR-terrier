	<brief_summary>H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Research Institute Sunshine Project Coordinator , recruit locally . The purpose research study establish dose combination drug , Topotecan Sorafenib child . This call maximum tolerate dose . The chemotherapy study combination Topotecan Sorafenib . The investigator try find high dose Topotecan Sorafenib give safely child Refractory Recurrent Pediatric Solid Malignancies . The investigator test different dos drug different group child . The investigator also study body process drug .</brief_summary>
