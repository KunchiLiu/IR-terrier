Different setting plan training : Clinical , Home Mobile Setting . Following , description protocol detail , experimental control group , three different setting . 1 ) In experimental condition , participant first take part intake session introduction training ( clinical setting ) assessment week detect stressful situation daily life portable biosensors smart phone ( home setting ) ; expose assessment session detect psycho-physiological variation occur different stressful environment exposure ( clinical setting ) . Afterwards , participant receive train psychological stress management base cognitive behavioral technique combine virtual reality , biofeedback mobile phone . The training structure ten session ( two per week , one last one hour ) , divide four part : - homework check - exposition stressful scenario follow cognitive restructuring clinician - relaxation - home assignment During training , biosensors wear monitor physiological parameter , track emotional/heath status directly influence experience virtual world . Relaxation induced immersion different virtual environment ( e.g. , lake ) customize different pre-recorded audio narrative describe specific set guide execution series relaxation exercise . Experimental group expose relax VR environment VR biofeedback , alternate way session . 18-months follow plan order verify efficacy train long-term period . 2 ) In control condition , participant receive training base protocol structure experimental group 's one , without use new technology biofeedback . In particular , guided imagery employ stress exposition relaxation exercise . The smart phone stress assessment replace traditional diary , mark stressful event assessment week .
