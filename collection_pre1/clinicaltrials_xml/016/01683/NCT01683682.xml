	<criteria>Histological confirm NonSmallCell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Tumor stage IV ( UICC 7th Version ) ECOG &lt; 2 Age &gt; 70 year No previous chemotherapy stage IV NSCLC ( UICC 7th Version ) Adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy NSCLC must complete least one year prior study enrolment ( end chemotherapy ) Patients prior radiation therapy may eligible study meet follow guideline : Previous radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow ( Cristy Eckerman 1987 ) , limited must include whole pelvis radiation . Patients must recover toxic effect treatment prior study enrolment ( except alopecia ) . Prior thoracic radiotherapy must complete 30 day study enrolment . Lesions irradiate included site measurable disease unless clear tumour progression document lesion since end radiation therapy . Palliative extrathoracic radiotherapy preexist lesion may continue study ; however , lesion may include site measurable disease . Adequate haematological laboratory parameter : Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dl WBC ≥3.000/µl Platelets ≥ 100.000/µl Neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µl Adequate renal laboratory parameter Creatinine ≤1,9 mg/dl Creatinine Clearance &gt; 45 ml/min Adequate hepatic function Total bilirubin within normal range Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( patient liver metastasis ) ALT &lt; 1.5 x ULN ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( patient liver metastasis ) AST &lt; 1.5 x ULN AST &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( patient liver metastasis ) Alk . phosphatase &lt; 3 x ULN LDH &lt; 5 x ULN ULN = Upper Limit Of Normal ( ULN ) Other lab parameter : Proteinuria &lt; CTCAE grade 2 Prothrombin time and/or partial thromboplastin time &lt; 50 % deviation normal limit Informed consent , personally sign date participate study Male patient enrol trial must use adequate barrier birth control measure course treatment least 3 month last administration study therapy Life expectancy least 3 month Any severe concomitant condition make undesirable patient participate study could jeopardise compliance protocol Serious infection require systemic antibiotic ( e.g antiviral , antimicrobial , antifungal ) therapy Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture major injury and/or surgery within 4 week trial inclusion , plan surgical procedure trial period . Investigational drug therapy outside trial within 4 week study entry Known hypersensitivity trial drug excipients . History malignancy last 5 year , particular could affect compliance protocol interpretation result . Patients adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer generally eligible . Serious concomitant disease , especially would limit compliance trial requirement consider relevant evaluation efficacy safety trial drug , neurologic , psychiatric , infectious disease active ulcer ( gastrointestinal tract , skin ) laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation trial drug administration , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry trial . Significant cardiovascular disease ( i.e . uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , history infarction within past 9 month , congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II ) Known inherited predisposition bleeds thrombosis . Patient brain metastasis symptomatic and/or require therapy . Therapeutic anticoagulation ( except low dose heparin and/or heparin flush need maintenance indwell intravenous device ) antiplatelet therapy ( except chronic lowdose therapy acetylsalicylic acid ≤ 325mg per day ) History major thrombotic event clinically relevant major bleed event past 6 month ( exclude central venous catheter thrombosis peripheral deep vein thrombosis joint space knee ) Current peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2 except due trauma Gastrointestinal disorder abnormality would interfere absorption study drug Active alcohol drug abuse .
