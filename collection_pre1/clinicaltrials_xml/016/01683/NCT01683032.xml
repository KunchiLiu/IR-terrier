	<brief_summary>Creative cognition play important role art , invention innovation , well everyday life thus significant effect society whole . Research healthy , normal participant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder indicate possible inverse relationship attentional function creativity . This evidence raise possibility Methylphenidate ( MPH ; Ritalin ) could decrease creativity people use cognitive enhancement . However , question address previous study . Hence , present study aim examine effect MPH creativity healthy young adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effect Methylphenidate Creativity Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The past decade see rise use prescription stimulant ADHD-diagnosed individual also normal healthy individual cognitive enhancement . This result corresponding escalation illicit use , particularly college student ( confirm numerous survey result ) . In light trend , important issue concern effect cognitive enhancement way people think , could call `` cognitive style '' , raise . Specifically , concern stimulant might decrease creativity people use drug cognitive enhancement ( . Creativity define ability produce response novel ( i.e. , original , rare unexpected ) suitable ( i.e. , adaptive useful accord task constrains ; ) . Many model suggest explain creativity . According well establish twofold model creativity , creative process begin associative generation crudely form idea , follow expansion exploration idea process evaluation . Since creativity play important role produce novel useful idea , speculate case cognitive enhancer continue widely practice indeed impair creativity , effect society whole could grave The question whether stimulant might decrease creativity yet elucidate , give previous study focus ADHD-diagnosed child , mixed result ; While find stimulant maintain creativity , others report actually worsen score task assess creativity . Moreover , despite increase illicit prescribe stimulant use healthy adult ( discuss ) study Farah et al . ( 2009 ) , far publish report investigate stimulant effect creativity among individual . The author examine effect Adderall ( mixture amphetamine salt ) upon creativity , 16 healthy adult four test creativity , `` two task require divergent think two require convergent thought ( p . 542 ) . '' Only performance convergent task affect , effect depend baseline performance : one case enhancing , particularly lower-performing individual , case enhance lower-performing impair higher-performing individual . This pattern differential effect stimulant base baseline performance , note study stimulant cognition unique creative thought . Hence , question whether stimulant might decrease creativity healthy adult use drug cognitive enhancement still open . To best knowledge , though MPH widely use healthy normal individual enhance cognition , effect upon creativity healthy adult study . We therefore sought investigate effect MPH upon creativity healthy adult . Participants : The experiment include group 30 healthy adult ( male female ) . Participants , age 21-40 year , recruit advertisement post University Haifa ( include website Haifa University ) . Screening Phase : Potential subject require arrive Social Affective Neuroscience Lab Haifa University two visit : On first visit , risk requirement clinical research trial explain potential subject . Those volunteer take part read sign Informed Consent Form participation clinical research trial trial-related procedure perform - Upon obtain sign informed consent , inclusion exclusion criterion review verify subject 's eligibility . Therefore participant interview psychiatrist Minimal Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I ( SCID-I ; First , Gibbons , Spitzer , &amp; Williams , 1995 ) exclude presence lifetime diagnose Axis I disorder . - In addition , rule ADHD , participant require fill follow questionnaire : conners ADHD Adults Rating-Scale , ASRS v1.1-18 Wender-Utah self-report rating- scale , Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale ( ASRS ) Symptom Checklist . Moreover , rule clinical disorder . - Each participant go physical examination physician ECG test eliminate risk previously undiagnosed arrhythmia . In one visit , participant receive capsule contain Methylphenidate placebo ( prior perform task ) , visit receive capsule contain placebo . Randomization do psychiatrist , experimenter participant blind content capsule ( The psychiatrist 's contact information provide Informed Consent Form ) . MPH dosage determine accord participant ' body weight : 10 mg case weight &lt; 40 kg ; 30 mg case weight &gt; 90 kg ; otherwise 20 mg .</detailed_description>
