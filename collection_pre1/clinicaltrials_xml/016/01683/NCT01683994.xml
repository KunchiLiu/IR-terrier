	<brief_summary>Background : - Cabozantinib drug slow growth blood vessel fee tumor . It approve medullary thyroid cancer . However , study show prostate tumor respond . Docetaxel prednisone standard treatment advanced prostate cancer . Researchers want see add cabozantinib two drug safe effective treatment type cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness cabozantinib standard treatment advanced prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance prostate cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study also perform . - Participants receive cancer drug 21-day cycle treatment . They take docetaxel cabozantinib day 1 cycle . Each docetaxel infusion take 1 hour . They also take prednisone mouth twice day . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants continue take study drug long cancer worsen side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Plus Docetaxel Prednisone Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Docetaxel establish first-line chemotherapy patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . However ; increasingly recognize combine docetaxel agent clinical activity without overlap toxicity could simultaneously target different cellular signaling pathway vital tumor survival , produce either additive synergistic activity . - Inhibition angiogenesis , either stand-alone approach combination chemotherapy , demonstrable antitumor efficacy CRPC several antiangiogenic agent clinical trial population patient . - Cabozantinib ( XL184 ) develop inhibitor angiogenesis resistance mechanism . It inhibitor multiple receptor tyrosine kinases include c-Met , VEGFR2 RET . - In single agent clinical study , cabozantinib demonstrate , broad anti-tumor activity across many solid tumor type . Objectives : - To determine safety profile cabozantinib combination docetaxel prednisone , determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose combination docetaxel . - To determine relative efficacy ( term PFS ) docetaxel cabozantinib compare docetaxel alone Eligibility : - Patients must progressive metastatic CRPC . There must radiographic evidence disease primary treatment surgery radiotherapy . If patient flutamide , must disease progression least 4 week withdrawal . Patients bicalutamide nilutamide must progression least 6 week withdrawal . Withdrawal criterion apply patient anti-androgens least prior 6 month . - Patients must least 18 year age able give inform consent . - Patients Phase II portion study must progress abiraterone enzalutamide Design : - The initial phase I portion study test fix dose docetaxel prednisone combination cabozantinib three escalate dos . Using standard 3 + 3 design , three patient initially treat dose level MTD define . - An expansion cohort enrol MTD characterize safety , toxicity pharmacokinetic data obtain preliminary information efficacy combination treatment . - In Phase II , patient enrol randomized two-arm cohort compare docetaxel combination cabozantinib docetaxel alone primary endpoint PFS . - The accrual ceiling study , include Phase I dose escalation expansion phase well Phase II randomize phase , set 81 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must metastatic , progressive , castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . There must radiographic evidence disease primary treatment surgery radiotherapy continue progress radiographically biochemically ( rise PSA level successive measurement ) despite adequate androgendeprivation therapy , define undergone bilateral surgical castration continue treatment GnRH agonists antagonist . Progression must evidence document follow parameter : Two consecutively rise PSA value , baseline , minimum 1 week interval Appearance one new lesion bone scan Progressive measurable disease RECIST 1.1 The use androgen receptor inhibitor require prior study entry . For patient receive antiandrogen agent ( flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ) , least 6 consecutive month immediately prior study entry , enter trial due rise PSA , must demonstrate continued rise PSA within 4 week stop flutamide within 6 week stop bicalutamide nilutamide . Flutamide , nilutamide bicalutamide disease progression requirement apply patient drug least prior 6 month . Histopathological confirmation prostate cancer Laboratory Pathology NCI Pathology Department Walter Reed National Military Medical Center YALE require prior enter study . Patients whose pathology specimens longer available may enrol patient clinical course consistent prostate cancer available documentation outside pathology laboratory diagnosis . All effort make material forward research team use correlative study case original tissue block archival biopsy material available .
