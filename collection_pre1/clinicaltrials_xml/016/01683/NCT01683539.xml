	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate whether computer-based cognitive exercise Thinking Skills Work ( TSW ) program critical improving work cognitive outcome consumer serious mental illness cognitive impairment enrol supported employment ( SE ) , whether streamline version TSW without component ( Cognitive Skills Work ( CSW ) program ) equally effective consumer . An RCT conduct two site ( Mental Health Center Greater Manchester New Hampshire Thresholds Inc. Illinois ) 244 consumer randomly assign one two group ( 122 , approximately 122 participant schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder 122 participant diagnosis ) : 1 ) TSW , 2 ) CSW . The TSW CSW program deliver Cognitive Specialists , work member SE team integrate cognitive vocational service . All participant continue receive SE service . Participants assess baseline , post-treatment 8 month ( completion active teaching component TSW CSW ) , 16 24 month post-baseline evaluate cognitive functioning , symptom , quality life . All work outcomes tracked weekly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unemployment major burden people severe mental illness ( SMI ) schizophrenia , competitive work rate typically 10-20 % . Over past two decade , support employment ( SE ) show improve competitive work person SMI , consider evidence-based practice ( EBP ) . However , need improve effectiveness SE , 30-60 % consumer work little , job often brief end unsuccessfully . Cognitive remediation , combine vocational rehabilitation , show promise improve work outcome , include consumer SE . The extensively studied approach Thinking Skills Work ( TSW ) program , develop research group , incorporate computer-based cognitive exercise restore cognitive skill teach compensatory strategy Cognitive Specialist integrate vocational rehabilitation team . Five randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , two conduct SE program ( include one previously conduct research group ) , show add TSW program vocational ( SE ) service improve work cognitive outcome compare vocational ( SE ) service alone . The propose study take next bold step `` dismantle '' TSW program evaluate whether cognitive practice exercise component critical improving outcome SE , whether streamline efficient version program focus teach compensatory skill sufficient . The study also yield important information whether consumer benefit computer cognitive exercise , others , permit TSW program individually tailor consumer ' personal need . In preparation propose study develop , standardize , pilot test variant TSW program , Cognitive Skills Work ( CSW ) program , teach compensatory skill manage cognitive difficulty omit computer cognitive exercise , result program approximately one-half intensity original TSW program . A small ongoing pilot study indicate consumer SE could readily engage retained CSW program obtain work , support feasibility streamline version TSW . The propose research RCT conduct two high fidelity SE program , compare effect TSW CSW program consumer enrol SE . The following hypothesis test : 1 . Primary Hypothesis : Participants TSW well competitive work outcomes CSW program . This hypothesis base fact virtually cognitive remediation research SMI include cognitive exercise design restore cognitive skill , computer-based cognitive exercise TSW , program also teach compensatory strategy . If null hypothesis reject , TSW find significantly effective CSW , dissemination effort focus efficient CSW . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Participants TSW improve cognitive functioning CSW . This hypothesis base rationale Hypothesis # 1 . Exploratory Analyses In addition evaluate whether TSW CSW program differ overall impact vocational cognitive outcome , explore whether consumer characteristic identify predict differential response either program . For example , possible consumer severe cognitive impairment respond well full TSW program , whereas less severe impairment may benefit equally well efficient CSW program . The propose research high potential impact improve outcome SE , establish EBP increase competitive work SMI , whose effectiveness limit extent consumer ' cognitive impairment . Maximizing efficiency TSW program , cognitive remediation program show improve work outcomes two RCTs SE program , determine whether streamlined version program require one-half time implement ( CSW program ) equally effective , could reduce cost disseminate implement program , make accessible consumer . This study could also help identify consumer benefit cognitive exercise component TSW , thereby facilitate tailor program individual 's personal need . Ultimately , research could play critical role make dream competitive work reality many consumer SMI .</detailed_description>
