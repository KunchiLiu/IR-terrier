	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Test Clinical Efficacy Low Energy AC Magnetic Field Treat Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) associate functional impairment disability , result significant burden affect individual , family , society general . Psychopharmacological therapy show effective , may accompany significant side effect . The investigator propose alternative model , base relationship symptom , brain metabolism , neural activity record electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Subjects MDD often decrease brain metabolism , accompany increased EEG activity alpha band . The investigator hypothesis gentle , non-significant risk , sinusoidal magnetic field subject 's scalp , oscillate precisely Intrinsic Alpha Frequency ( IAF ) take advantage relationship reduce symptom without significant side effect associate pharmaceutical . The investigator propose 4-week , sham control , randomize , double-blind multi-center feasibility study determine efficacy synchronize low energy magnetic field deliver subject 's IAF treat MDD . Treatment give concomitant subject 's exist medication , occur 5 day per week clinical site . Target enrollment 45 adult subject diagnose MDD .</detailed_description>
