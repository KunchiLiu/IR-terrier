	<brief_summary>Patients relapse leukemia often develop resistance chemotherapy . For reason , attempt use patient 's T cell , genetically modify express chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) . The CAR enable T cell recognize kill leukemic cell though recognition CD19 , protein express surface majority pediatric ALL . This phase I study design determine maximum tolerate dose CAR+ T cell define toxicity treatment . As secondary aim , look efficacy T cell eradicate patient 's leukemic cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pediatric Trial Genetically Modified Autologous T Cells Directed Against CD19 Relapsed CD19+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon meet eligibility requirement enrol study , subject undergo blood draw obtain T cell generation CD19 CAR+ T cell . The T cell isolate blood , transduce lentivirus express CD19 CAR , expand culture three week period . During process cell generation , subject continue care primary oncologist may undergo additional treatment direct leukemia time . After CAR+ T cell generate , subject undergoes disease assessment admit hospital receive 2 day cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion reduction disease burden . Several day later , subject receive infusion CAR+ T cell . Following treatment CAR+ T cell , subject intensely follow 6 week serial blood test re-evaluation disease status bone marrow aspirate . After 6 week , subject clinical care resume primary oncologist , possible would receive additionally chemotherapy stem cell transplant . Upon completion study , subject follow least annually either medical history , physical exam blood test phone call/questionnaire 15 year . This follow help determine subject develops long-term health problem relate CAR+ T cell include new cancer .</detailed_description>
