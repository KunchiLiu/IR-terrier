	<brief_summary>The goal study determine hormonal/metabolic reponse ingestion sugar compare consume artificial sweeten drink , evalute macronutrient consumption 24 hour post ingestion drink . We hypothesize artificially sweeten ( AS ) consumption lead relatively similar hormonal/metabolic response glucose consumption therefore secondary rise caloric intake .</brief_summary>

A beverage contain 0.42 gram artificially sweetener ( Aspartame , similar sweetness level ) During meeting , participant drink sweeten drink follow blood work , do oral glucose challenge tolerance test ( OGTT / GTT ) . Also , record macronutrient\caloric consumption 24 hour follow test .</detailed_description>
