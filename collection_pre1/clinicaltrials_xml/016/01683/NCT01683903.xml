	<brief_summary>Treatment chronic heart failure require multidisciplinary approach recognize role cardiac rehabilitation . Rehabilitation help improve patient 's functional , decrease morbidity mortality , decrease rehospitalization rate , thereby reduce cost disease . After recovery acute phase cardiac infarction , patient admit rehabilitation center follow usual rehabilitation program hospitalization period . This step preclude outpatient follow-up period day hospital , accordance physician cardiologists manage monitoring . The study INCARD ( Insuffisance Cardiaque en Readaptation Durable ) develop evaluate benefit sustainable rehabilitation heart failure patient treat optimally educate follow-up period 24 month . The main objective study compare benefit rehabilitation coronary ( C ) non-coronary ( NC ) patient evaluation time point , periodically record</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Cardiac Rehabilitation Benefits Between Coronary Non-coronary Patients Through 24 Months Follow-up After Myocardial Infarction : `` INCARD '' Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We undertake prospective follow-up study 150 rehabilitate patient heart failure ( 75 C ; 75 NC ) . The main objective compare benefit rehabilitation coronary non-coronary patient base functional improvement i.e . improvement VO2max , LVEF ( ultrasound method and/or isotopic ) , 6-min walk test , Minnesota index quality life . In addition , clinical outcome ( HR , SBP , DBP , BMI ) paraclinical data ( creatinine clearance ) measure patient ' standard clinical follow-up . Clinical data patient admit cardiac rehabilitation , include heart failure patient ( LVEF &lt; 40 ) , record collection sign informed consent agreement . Patients address heart failure intensive care unit coronary ( USIC ) acute cardiac service rehabilitation department . Patients admitted rehabilitation department clinically stable ( least three week acute episode ) . Etiology heart failure assess patient stratified C NC patient . Expected Results We estimate mean duration inpatient rehabilitation ( H period ) . Then , follow patient ' cardiac evaluation parameter record outpatient follow-up , first 3 month inclusion every 6 month 24 month outpatient follow-up . These data allow comparison benefit rehabilitation coronary ( C ) non-coronary ( NC ) patient evaluation time point give information clinical improvement group patient .</detailed_description>
