	<brief_title>Evaluation HBDL Coil Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Device - Feasibility Study Treatment Borderline Personality Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The symptom borderline personality disorder treat , know cure . Several recent study show patient suffer borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) express significant hypoactivity small gray matter concentration anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , compare healthy control . In current study attempt find good solution treatment Borderline Personality Disorder use deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( dTMS ) technology . The HBDL coil intend induce activation prefrontal orbitofrontal brain structure , include ACC , order induce long term potentiation brain region . The protocol include bilateral stimulation SMA 110 % motor threshold Abductor Policies Brevis frequency 10 Hz . session comprise four cycle 3 second stimulation 20 second recess ( Total number pulse : 1200 ) .approximately 20 patient diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder participate . subject would undergo rTMS session five day week , four week , use HBDL dTMS coil . coil capable produce magnetic field deeper part cerebral cortex , reason believe produce well clinical outcome superficial TMS coil use early study . The goal study determine safety efficacy transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) treat patient suffer borderline personality disorder . Our main objective observe reduction severity symptoms post treatment comparison pre treatment , use zan-bpd main outcome measure . Additional objective observe normalizaition borderline 's empathic tendency : one hand , expect affective empathy compromise post treatment comparison pre treatment . hand , expect heir cognitive empathy increase post treatment comparison pre treatment . Note first day subject randomize receive sham stimulation real stimulation . subject receive real stimulation first day receive sham stimulation second day . Likewise , Subjects receive sham stimulation first day receive real stimulation second day . After receive stimulation subject perform facemorph task evaluate empathic capability . 20 day treatment start third day .</detailed_description>
