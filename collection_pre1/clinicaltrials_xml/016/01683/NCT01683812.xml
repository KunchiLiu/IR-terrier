	<brief_title>Cranial Cup Use Correction Head Shape Deformities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cranial cup non-invasive , non-restrictive , adjustable orthotic device grows infant maintain proper body alignment promote normal head shape development . While cranial cup yet FDA approve , consider non-significant medical device successfully correct asymmetric positional head shape deformities hundred healthy newborn le 4 month age care Children 's Hospital Boston outpatient plagiocephaly clinic . Additionally preliminary analysis prospective randomize control trial currently underway suggest cranial cup may useful prevention positional head shape deformity cohort hospitalize infant vary gestational age . However , cranial cup never use correction common form positional head shape deformity hospitalize premature infant ; namely dolichocephaly . Thus , purpose descriptive study provide information feasibility use cranial cup small sample prematurely born infant dolichocephaly convalescent phase hospitalization . Information obtain descriptive study use determine large investigation use cranial cup warrant specific patient population .</detailed_description>
