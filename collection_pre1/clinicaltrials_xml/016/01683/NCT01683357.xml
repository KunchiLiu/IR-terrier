	<brief_summary>It rare two-stage hepatectomy multiple bilobar colorectal liver metastasis ( CLM ) leave incomplete disease progression technical reason . One-stage hepatectomy seem feasible safe alternative , however , long-term result lack . This study aim provide evidence one-stage hepatectomy compel tumor exposure provide adequate long-term result low risk local recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognosis One-stage Hepatectomy Bilobar Colorectal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility Criteria The prospectively recruited cohort patient herein analysed result policy patient consider resectable present 4 lesion , bilobar CLM systematically approach one stage operation . Patients consider unresectable concomitance 3 lung metastasis , diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis , and/or extra-hilar lymph node metastasis . Outcome measure The primary outcome feasibility intention-to-treat basis . To purpose studied ratio number patient surgically explore effectively receive resection . The secondary outcome safety procedure . To purpose studied morbidity , mortality , amount blood loss , rate blood transfusion , postoperative trend liver function test . The tertiary outcome measure reliability procedure oncological standpoint . For purpose study following : 1. rate true local recurrence ( cut-edge ) minimum follow-up 6 month ; 2. long-term follow-up , analyse overall survival ( survival surgery ) , time recurrence ( survival without recurrence ) , time liver recurrence ( survival without liver recurrence ) . 3. overall survival compare base intention-to-treat criterion also include outcome patient meet inclusion criterion result unresectable exploration .</detailed_description>
