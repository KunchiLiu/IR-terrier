	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Peripheral blood Very Small Embryonic-like Stem Cells ( VSELs ) different coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient without CAD , might account benefit Atorvastatin CAD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Association Between Very Small Embryonic-like Stem Cells Prognosis Coronary Artery Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Hypothesis : The VSELs might mobilize situation cardiac ischemia CAD patient . In addition , benefit derive Atorvastatin administration CAD patient may relate VSELs via sCD40L-SDF1/CXCR4 signal pathway . 2 . The number function peripheral blood VSELs CAD patient compare control . 1 . Included patient : include 200 CAD patient receive coronary angiography ( CAG ) positive subject , 100 control negative CAG . 2 . The IRB approve subject sign inform consent . 3 . All subject receive detection analysis peripheral blood VSELs , include VSEL number , immigration capability sCD40L administration . 4 . All subject receive follow-up 1 year , MACE ( major adverse cardiovascular event ) record include angina , repeat myocardial infarction , repeat revascularization , major organ dysfunction , death . 5. association VSELs MACE CAD patient statistically analyze . 3 . Atorvastatin administration improve prognosis CAD patient exert impact VSELs 1 . Included patient : include 200 CAD patient receive coronary angiography positive subject , 100 control negative coronary angiography . 2 . The IRB approve subject sign inform consent . 3 . Fifty CAD subject receive intensive Atorvastatin administration 50 CAD patient receive routine Atorvastatin administration control . 4 . All subject receive follow-up 1 year , peripheral blood VSELs , SDF-1/CXCR4 test , MACE ( major adverse cardiovascular event ) record include angina , repeat myocardial infarction , repeat revascularization , major organ dysfunction , death . 5. Intensive Atorvastatin protocol indicate 80mg Atorvastatin administrate CAG , follow 20mg Atorvastatin entire study period . 6. Routine Atorvastatin protocol indicate 20mg Atorvastatin daily entire study period .</detailed_description>
