	<detailed_description>This phase IV , randomize control clinical trial three type oral poliovirus vaccine provide 2-week 4-week interval . The study enroll 1,000 participant rural Matlab urban Dhaka . In study infant give two different type oral poliovirus vaccine , monovalent OPV type 1 ( mOPV1 ) bivalent OPV type 1 3 ( bOPV ) use two different schedule : short schedule administration two week interval usual schedule four week interval . The immune response vaccine schedule compare response routine oral polio vaccine schedule Bangladesh trivalent oral polio vaccine ( tOPV ) give 4 week interval . The study use randomize controlled trial design . Eligible infant randomize 6 week age one five study arm : A ) 3 dos bOPV 6 , 8 10 week age ( 2-week interval dos ) ; B ) 3 dos bOPV 6 , 10 14 week age ( 4-week interval dos ) ; C ) 3 dos mOPV1 6 , 8 10 week age ( 2-week interval dos ) ; D ) 3 dos mOPV1 6 , 10 14 week age ( 4-week interval dos ) ; E ) 3 dos tOPV 6 , 10 14 week age ( 4-week interval dos ) . Currently , tOPV provide routine immunization Bangladesh age propose study . bOPV , mOPV1 mOPV3 license several country World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend use immunization campaign among child 0 5 year response circulation type 1 type 3 wild poliovirus , prevent outbreak country risk . To assess immunogenicity study vaccine vaccination schedule , antibody titer poliovirus type 1 , 2 3 determine serum extract blood collect ( 6 week age ) receive 3 dos study vaccine . Seroconversion define titer 4-fold high expect fall maternally derived antibody , assume half life 28 day . The initial antibody titer 6 week age use start point expect decline maternal antibody . We calculate one-sided 95 % confidence interval difference proportion seroconversions achieve short interval study arm longer interval study arm . If confidence interval include 10 % , conclude short interval inferior long interval . This analysis apply difference bOPV mOPV1 . This study answer follow question : 1 . Is immunogenicity 3 dos bOPV non inferior 3 dos mOPV1 type 1 poliovirus ? 2 . Is interval 2 week bOPV mOPV1 dos non inferior interval 4 week ? 3 . Will replacement tOPV bOPV routine immunization schedule achieve similar high proportion child immune type 1 3 poliovirus ? The answer question guide Global Polio Eradication Program implement new strategy may : 1 ) improve quality response outbreaks follow importation wild poliovirus type 1 shorten interval several OPV dos provide ; 2 ) prevent alternate outbreak type 1 type 3 poliovirus use bOPV instead monovalent OPVs ; 3 ) prevent emergence type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus replacement tOPV bOPVin immunization campaign routine immunization program .</detailed_description>

Family able understand comply plan study procedure Family residence outside ICDDR , B HDSS service area , family expect move away study period , exclude . A diagnosis suspicion immunodeficiency disorder ( either infant member immediate family ) . A diagnosis suspicion bleed disorder would contraindicate venipuncture . Acute diarrhea , infection illness time first visit ( 6 week age ) would require infant 's admission hospital would contraindicate provision OPV per country guideline . Acute vomit intolerance liquid within 24 hour first visit ( 6 week age ) . Receipt OPV IPV time enrollment base upon mother 's recall immunization card available . Because contact transmission vaccine poliovirus strain , newborn multiple birth exclude study prevent transmission vaccine strain receive routine immunization twin study participant .</criteria>
