	<brief_summary>Older woman exaggerate increase blood pressure exercise . However , reason unclear . It important investigate phenomenon great blood pressure response exercise associate increase risk stroke mortality otherwise healthy individual . A unique aspect age woman profound change hormone level ( i.e . estrogen progesterone ) associate menopause . The influence change estrogen progesterone level cardiovascular response exercise poorly understood . However , suggest hormone might change responsiveness cardiovascular system . Possible mechanism could account change arterial baroreflex feedback exercise muscle ( know exercise pressor reflex ) , know powerfully modulate blood pressure exercise . However , date , human study thoroughly examine influence change hormone level baroreflex function exercise exercise pressor reflex old woman . As , purpose research project ass baroreflex function exercise pressor reflex old woman transdermal estrogen alone , transdermal estrogen plus progesterone , progesterone alone placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Older postmenopausal woman randomize , double-blinded crossover design , receive ( ) transdermal estradiol , delivery rate 100 µg day-1 plus oral placebo , ( ii ) transdermal estradiol 100 µg day-1 plus oral progesterone ( provera 5 mg ) ( iii ) placebo patch plus oral progesterone ( provera 5 mg ) ( iv ) placebo patch plus oral placebo . The experimental measurement procedure perform 4 week treatment . Experimental measurement : Blood Pressure- A blood pressure cuff wrap around right arm obtain blood pressure via standard automate auscultometric device ( Welch-Allyn ) . In addition , beat-by-beat blood pressure obtain via finger photoplethysmography ( Finapress blood pressure monitor ) . Heart Rate- Standard limb lead electrode use obtain heart rate measurement . Respiration- An elastic band place around subject 's abdomen measure rate depth breathing . Blood Samples- A venous catheter place subject arm blood sample . For screen purpose measurement glucose , electrolyte , cholesterol triglyceride make . In addition , progesterone , estrogen testosterone , assess verify hormonal status . Sympathetic Nerve Activity- A tiny microelectrode place peroneal nerve leg , locate knee outer part leg . Alternatively , median nerve locate inside elbow use . At point nerve closest surface skin . The course nerve determine electrically stimulate skin pencil shape electrode . When nerve stimulate , involuntary twitch and/or tingle sensation foot hand occur . The twitch tingling disappear stimulation stop . Once nerve find , two tiny , sterile , microelectrodes insert skin . One reference electrode place nerve site ( 2 cm ) record electrode . The record electrode advance nerve . When tip electrode enters nerve , subject may briefly notice either pressure tingle sensation . At point , minor adjustment position electrode make optimal nerve signal obtain . Limb Blood Flow Measurements- Blood flow arm leg may also measure use duplex Doppler ultrasound non-invasively measure mean arterial blood velocity diameter . Femoral brachial blood velocity obtain place Doppler flow probe skin common femoral artery distal inguinal ligament brachial artery , respectively . Ultrasound image femoral artery brachial artery diameter perform site match velocity measure . The following formula use calculate blood flow : blood flow = π * radius2 * velocity . Urine sample collect measure specific gravity pH use test strip . Experimental Procedures : Neck Pressure Neck Suction- A pad neck collar fit around anterior portion subject 's neck application brief 5-second period neck pressure neck suction . This allow application positive negative pressure carotid sinus baroreceptor locate region . The positive pressure transiently cause receptor detect decrease blood pressure thus cause acute increase heart rate , blood pressure . The negative pressure transiently cause receptor detect increase blood pressure thus cause acute decrease heart rate , blood pressure . This procedure use extensively non-invasively ass baroreflex function healthy subject age 18-80 year . Nevertheless , subject 50 year age Doppler imaging perform screen atherosclerotic plaque within carotid vessel rule carotid artery disease determine feasibility perform neck pressure neck suction . Handgrip Exercise Post Exercise Ischemia- The subject ask perform handgrip exercise either two minute feel like maintain exercise ( i.e. , fatigue ) . Five second stop exercise , cuff around upper arm inflate impede blood flow 2 minute . This traps metabolite produce exercise area muscle , maintain stimulation skeletal muscle metaboreceptor afferent . Since metaboreceptor afferent contribute rise blood pressure exercise , continue stimulation receptor maintain blood pressure response .</detailed_description>
