	<brief_title>Oral Tyramine Pressor Response Study CX157 Tablets Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology : The trial Phase 1 , single center , DB , three-period study cardiovascular safety follow oral administration encapsulate tyramine prior treatment double-blind ( DB ) study drug ( CX157 Modified Release Tablets , 125 mg administer twice per day ( BID ) match placebo administer BID ) administration tyramine yogurt along standard meal DB study treatment administration , CX157 reach steady state . Prior treatment DB study treatment , baseline cardiovascular sensitivity oral tyramine administer fast state establish 15 subject Period 1 Days 1-3 . Following completion Period 1 , study 's 12 subject randomize CX157 ( 10 subject ) placebo ( 2 subject ) treat six consecutive day ( Days 4-9 ) reach steady state . Subjects continue DB study treatment Period 3 ( Days 10-12 ) ; however , period tyramine administer subject fed state Day 10 ( tyramine 20 mg ) , Day 11 ( tyramine 40 mg ) Day 12 ( tyramine 80 mg ) . The tyramine pressor dose ( minimum dose tyramine necessary achieve endpoint ) Period 1 establish series three tyramine challenge ( 24 hour apart ) tyramine dos base upon predetermined paradigm . During Period 1 , untreated fasting subject receive initial tyramine challenge dose 400 mg monitor SBP endpoint change ( SBP increase ≥30 mmHg three consecutive occasion least five minute apart 10-minute ( i.e. , TYR303 ) . If pressor endpoint achieve , tyramine challenge dose administer Period 1 Day 2 reduce 200 mg . However , endpoint achieve , tyramine challenge dose raise Period 1 Day 2 600 mg . This dose escalation/reduction paradigm repeat Period 1 Day 3 base upon result Period 1 Day 2 order establish tyramine pressor dose period . During Period 2 ( Days 4-9 ) subject treat CX157 placebo twice daily reach steady state . On Day 8 Period 2 , single-blind yogurt without tyramine administer lunch familiarize subject clinic staff procedure Period 3 . The tyramine challenge Period 3 Days 10 - 12 begin six consecutive day treatment CX157 placebo twice daily . The tyramine dos Period 3 20 , 40 , 80 mg ( 24 hour apart ) . The endpoint Period 3 describe Period 1 , reach pressor endpoint ( i.e. , TYR303 ) . The study plan 12 healthy male volunteer subject randomize Period 2 . Ten ( 10 ) subject randomize CX157 MR Tablets , 125 mg 2 matching placebo . Approximately 15 subject enter Period 1 order ensure randomization 12 subject Period 2 study .</detailed_description>
