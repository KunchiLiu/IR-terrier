	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Nitric Oxide Gel Subjects With Painful Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain common symptom diabetic neuropathy , predominantly involve low limb . Current strategy management painful diabetic neuropathy include improved glycemic control , use analgesic addition tricyclic antidepressant anticonvulsant . However , many patient experience unsatisfactory response undesired side effect . Considerable evidence implicates impair nitric oxide synthesis play important role pathogenesis diabetic neuropathic pain . Several small study show topical nitroglycerin ointment local vasodilating property , previous study demonstrate isosorbide dinitrate spray form nitric oxide donor relieved neuropathic symptom patient painful diabetic neuropathy . Based finding , investigator hypothesize nitric oxide gel could use alternative pain-relieving agent patient resistant diabetic neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
