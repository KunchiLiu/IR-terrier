	<detailed_description>Chile belong country high mortality rate due gastric cancer , disease frequent cause cancer death Chile . Despite adequate surgery , survival rate disappointing , less 60 % patient stag achieve alive 5 year . This due fact frequently gastric cancer diagnose advanced stage . For locally advanced gastric cancer multimodality treatment recommend , alternative surgery follow chemotherapy ( asian approach ) , surgery follow chemoradiation ( US approach ) perioperative chemotherapy ( european approach ) . These three strategy valid standard treatment option show improve overall survival stage IB IVA gastric cancer . Perioperative chemotherapy administer pre- postoperatively , show downstage tumor , increase curative resection , progression free overall survival . For patient potentially resectable gastric cancer stag T2 high cN+ , NCCN Guidelines recommend perioperative chemotherapy ( category1 ) . Chilean guideline gastric cancer state alternative perioperative chemotherapy , however approach use widely public hospital lack financial support . Some gastric cancer overexpress HER2 , subset patient benefit targeted therapy advance stage . The proportion patient molecular characteristic vary widely depend geographic area . The chilean population investigate small series , incidence HER2 positive gastric cancer know . We therefore plan measure HER2 expression participate patient .</detailed_description>
