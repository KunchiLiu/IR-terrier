	<brief_summary>Background : - Bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSC ) bone marrow biopsy use treat disorder cause inflammation immune system diseases . BMSC use treat graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , complication develop stem cell transplant . BMSC also use treat post-transplant complication , like marrow failure tissue injury . - The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) develop procedure collect preserve BMSC volunteer donor . These donor pass test ensure cell healthy enough used treatment . Researchers want use collect cell treat people GVHD , marrow failure , tissue injury follow stem cell transplant . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness NIH-collected BMSC treat complication stem cell transplant . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age complication stem cell transplant . - Complications acute GVHD , poor bone marrow function , tissue organ damage . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also image study blood test . - Participants provide blood , skin , bone marrow sample BMSC treatment . Additional sample , include tissue sample , collect start treatment . - Participants three BMSC infusion . There week infusion . Participants monitor closely infusion . Any side effect treat . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test physical exam . - After end infusion , participant regular followup visit 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSC ) derive bone marrow aspiration/biopsy important anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive property make suitable candidate cellular therapy inflammatory degenerative disorder . BMSC suppress lymphocyte immune responsiveness hone sit inflammation promote healing . BMSC first use man successfully treat refractory acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) . A recent multicenter study treat refractory aGVHD report 66 % response rate sustain survival responding patient . BMSC currently evaluate acute GVHD several ongoing study worldwide . BMSC also use treat post-transplant condition directly due GVHD . Responses report hemorrhagic cystitis , pneumoperitoneum . BMSC also evaluation treatment inflammatory autoimmune disorder . The Cell Processing Section Department Transfusion Medicine Clinical Center NIH develop procedure collecting , expand cryopreserving clinical grade BMSC FDA Drug Master File ( DMF ) . Marrow aspirate volunteer donor participate protocol 10-CC-0053 pass standard screen blood marrow donor BMSC expand vitro . Since necessary HLA-match BMSC donor recipient study , BMSC repository use source BMSC study . This first trial safety NIH BMSC cellular product stem cell transplant recipient . In phase I study , open adult NIH allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) recipient , evaluate safety fix dose BMSC infusion ( target dose 2 x 106 BMSCs /kg ( +/- 10 % ) ) patient acute GVHD , marrow failure tissue injury follow allogeneic SCT . Up three BMSC infusion give every 7 3 day apart . Safety monitor continuously stop rule toxicity base treatment-related serious adverse event rate . Organ-specific clinical response measure . Where possible also attempt identify transfuse BMSC site damage biopsy material . It plan accrue 10 subject 6-month period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 5.1.1 History allogeneic SCT Any subject receive allogeneic SCT NIH eligible one follow condition . Subjects may continue receive standard treatment condition may enter onto new investigational protocol treat condition period evaluation BMSC infusion . 5.1.1.1 Acute GVHD Biopsy confirm within 14 day investigational intervention ( unless possible perform anatomical location clinical contraindication ) acute GVHD affect gut and/or liver and/or skin , define steroid refractory : failure respond great equal 2mg/kg methylprednisolone ( equivalent ) 7 day OR steroid dependent : require methylprednisolone ( equivalent ) great equal 1mg/kg great equal 7days control GVHD . GVHD affect skin alone rarely lethal exclude . Acute GVHD define use NIH consensus definition inclusive Classic acute ( &lt; 100 day transplant DLI , presence acute GVHD feature , absence chronic GVHD feature ) AND Persistent/recurrent/late onset acute ( &gt; 100 day transplant DLI , presence acute GVHD feature , absence chronic GVHD feature ) . 5.1.1.2 Marrow Failure Poor graft function presence &gt; 95 % donor myeloid chimerism : defined platelet red cell transfusion dependent OR absolute neutrophil count persist &lt; 500/ ( Micro ) l 14 day without reversible treatable cause . 5.1.1.3 Pulmonary injury Lung injury : Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ( DAH ) , Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia ( COP ) , Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS ) , idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IP ) , Adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) diagnose exclusion active infection . Also worsen pneumomediastinum pneumothorax persist 7 day ; risk cause hemodynamic change association diagnose . 5.1.1.4 Hepatic injury Clinically diagnose sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( SOS ) , previously know venoocclusive disease ( VOD ) , bilirubin &gt; 2 time ULN transaminase &gt; 3 time ULN rise . 5.1.1.5 Hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) HC require continuous bladder irrigation OR require red cell platelet transfusion least intermittently past 7 day OR HC unresponsive antiviral 10 day . 5.1.1.6 Gastrointestinal tract Pneumoperitoneum , bowel perforation susceptible corrective surgery OR blood transfusion requirement &gt; 1 unit per day 7 day . 5.1.2 Age : great equal 18 year age less equal 75 year age . 5.1.3 Birth Control Subjects childbearing childfathering potential must willing use medically acceptable form birth control , include abstinence , treat study . 5.1.4 Transplant perform NIH . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 5.2.1 Breast feeding pregnant female ( due unknown risk fetus newborn ) . 5.2.2 Allergic gentamicin 5.2.3 Weight less 20 kg ( informative research sample ) 5.2.4 Patients significant organ failure baseline evidence follow : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Symptomatic cardiac failure rest minimal activity exertion intervention indicate 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Creatinine &gt; 3.0 X ULN 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Decreased oxygen saturation rest ( e.g . pulse oximeter &lt; 88 % PaO2 le equal 55 mmHg )</criteria>
