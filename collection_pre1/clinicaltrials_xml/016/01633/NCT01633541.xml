	<brief_summary>To evaluate new treatment approach adult advance laryngeal cancer : induction chemotherapy platinum docetaxel plus AT-101 . AT-101 investigational drug treatment advance cancer . It hop combination chemotherapy regimen allow cancer patient keep voice box improve/maintain voice-related quality life . The ultimate goal study prevent surgery remove subject voice box .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy AND Bcl-xL Inhibitor ( AT-101 ) For Organ Preservation In Adults With Advanced Laryngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Published data demonstrate equal efficacy improve quality life platinum taxane compare platinum 5-Fluorouracil [ 31 ] . Additionally , weekly cisplatin regimen ( 30-40 mg/m2 ) radiotherapy appear equally efficacious well tolerated standard high-dose cisplatin ( 100 mg/ m2 ) regimens radiation therapy locally advance SCCHN [ 32 ] The investigator thus attempt reduce toxicity induction chemotherapy use docetaxel/cisplatin ( carboplatin ) ( TP ) place previously use standard regimen cisplatin 5-fluorouracil ( PF ) administer weekly cisplatin ( carboplatin ) radiation patient responder induction therapy . Finally , Phase I/II test small molecule inhibitor , AT-101 , recently complete , suggest activity solid tumor combine cytotoxic agent . Since investigator achieve high survival rate treatment selection approach laryngeal cancer , ultimate goal reduce rate salvage laryngectomy improve quality life . The investigator hypothesize specific inhibition Bcl-2/Bcl-xL function increase response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy decrease need salvage laryngectomy . Hence , investigator propose study : treatment patient advance SCC larynx one cycle platinum plus docetaxel AT-101 , follow chemoradiotherapy respond induction regimen reserve total laryngectomy non-responders .</detailed_description>
