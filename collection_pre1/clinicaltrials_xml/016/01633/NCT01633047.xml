	<brief_summary>The anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) frequently injure , structure athlete´s knee high prevalence reconstruction . Given postoperative ACL reconstruction scenario investigator find literature effectiveness neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) adjuvant treatment strengthen quadriceps muscle . The intensity NMES train duration important factor successful treatment . The purpose study compare two rehabilitation protocol patient post operative ACL reconstruction strength knee extension control edema . It randomize control study CONSORT base 40 participant divide two group : Control group submit physical therapy exercise , Intervention group submit physical therapy exercise plus electrical stimulation ( low frequency device current 47 Hz symmetrical , biphasic pyramidal waveform , pulse duration 1.5 interval 1.8 ) . The procedure last six week . It evaluate pre intervention quadriceps muscle extension force mean manual dynamometer , joint swell perimeter . This procedure repeat six week intervention .</brief_summary>

Individuals previous knee lesion , ligament injury , osteochondritis associate meniscus repair complication surgery include study . Patients carry complimentary therapy propose treatment exclude . The participant randomize two group : control electrical stimulation group . Intervention All subject submit physiotherapy session three time week , follow 12 week criterion base reahabilitation , carry line objective propose rehabilitation phase ( immediate post-operative , early post-operativeand late post-operative ) . A group train physiotherapist design exercise determinate evolution , include range motion improvement , muscular control strength , gait training progression weight bear sensory-motor control training , accord establish guideline . The patient electrical stimulation group receive , addition , NMES application first six week treatment , use electrical stimulator carrier frequency 47 Hz symmetrical , biphasic pyramidal wave , pulse duration 150 µs duty cycle 1,5 sec 1,8 sec . Evaluation It evaluate pre intervention quadriceps muscle extension force mean manual dynamometer , joint swell perimeter . This procedure repeat six week intervention .</detailed_description>
