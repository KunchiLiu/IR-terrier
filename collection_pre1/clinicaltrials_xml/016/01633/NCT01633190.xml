	<brief_summary>- Rotavirus Hospital Admissions Surveillance - Retrospective surveillance 2010 2011 hospital admission child age 0 16 year due rotavirus gastroenteritis complete center IMPACT ( Immunization Monitoring Program , ACTive ) pediatric hospital network . - Prospective surveillance rotavirus-related admission child age 0 16 year conduct 2012-14 inclusive perform additional three year , 2015 , 2016 2017 12 site . Surveillance methodology continue use case-finding strategy case report form past surveillance ( Case report do electronically . - Emergency Department Burden Disease Case find all-cause diarrheal illness use ICD code undertake prospectively 2012 2014 continue year 2015-17 inclusive . Systematic stool sample carried case gastroenteritis child &lt; 5 year age present ED department IMPACT hospital 2012 2013 5 12 center hospital 2014 . This component continue 2015-17 protocol study year . However admitted case present IMPACT center hospital positive rotavirus report stool sample save genotyping later date .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canadian Rotavirus Surveillance Through Immunization Monitoring Program Active ( IMPACT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ability provide contemporary Canadian data two important outcome measure effectiveness rotavirus vaccine : hospital admission emergency department visit . The extended time period already exist prior vaccine implementation ( 2005 2011 ) provide longterm baseline data compare disease burden 2012 2017 . The major advantage study surveillance occurs hospital methodology CRF use since 2005 . This ensure reliability consistency surveillance study . The national data set capture patient age group 0 16 year 12 center across country . The retrospective prospective study unique position capture child admit 12 pediatric hospital Canada . Since reliance discharge code alone may underestimate gastroenteritis due rotavirus , laboratory surveillance couple medical record review ensure complete capture true disease burden . Data health status child facilitate evaluation child medically fragile rotavirus infection may significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>There three part criteria Hospital admission surveillance ( December 2017 ) ; Emergency Department determination disease burden ( To December 2014 ) ; genotype surveillance ( December 2017 ) A . Hospital admission surveillance : Age 0 16 year age . Inpatient status IMPACT hospital Acute onset symptom acute gastroenteritis without diarrheal stool , without vomit , without fever . Laboratory confirmation rotavirus stool specimens autopsy tissue sample use antigen detection method ( enzyme link immunoassay [ ELISA ] immunochromatographic method ) electron microscopy molecular ( PCR ) diagnosis stool specimen take within 14 day onset gastrointestinal symptom . Cases identify autopsy must gastrointestinal symptom death . Referred case rotavirus infection laboratory confirmation another institution use criterion Exclusion criterion Nonlaboratory confirm diagnosis . Clinical data accessible nurse monitor . Incidental finding rotavirus patient admit hospital without acute gastrointestinal symptom . B . Emergency Department Visits determination disease burden determination proportion rotavirus infection Inclusion criterion : The number child 5 year age discharge ED ICD code diagnosis diarrheal illness . Parents child present emergency department participate center ask allow child 's stool sample test rotavirus accord guideline set respective Ethics review board IMPACT center . C : Rotavirus genotyping C. Rotavirus Genotype Surveillance include specimens A B . Exclusion criterion : No stool sample Inclusion criterion : Rotavirus identification : Rotavirus identification site accomplish rotavirus antigen detect EIA ( Enzyme Immuno Assay ) electron microscopy . At hospital , patient admit hospital acute diarrheal illness stool specimen send viral testing . Stool specimen admit patient save . The rotavirus positive specimen patient present ED consent stool specimen test positive rotavirus also save . A convenience sample rotavirus positive specimen forward genotype test National microbiology laboratory . All rotavirus positive stool ED hospitalize case line list date collection diagnosis . At end season , depend number positive , site select every second , third fourth specimen ( forth ) forward genotyping laboratory order equal 20 specimen per site ensure equal representation time period rotavirus season site acquisition ( ED hospitalize case ) . This yield maximum 280 sample per year . These stool store frozen 80Â°C genotype analysis . Nine province send isolates directly National Microbiology Laboratory direction Dr. Timothy Booth genotype analysis . The two IMPACT center Montreal genotype analysis provincial laboratory subsequently share data Vaccine Evaluation Center Vancouver . A proportion strain exchange laboratory order validate result .</criteria>
