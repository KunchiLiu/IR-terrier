	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION 1 . Objectives The principal aim EICS improve management PJI develop consensus guideline across Europe . By systematic analysis consecutively include patient PJI , factor associate best outcome regard infection ( assessed infection-free interval ) joint function ( assessed degree pain , mobility , range motion ) determine longitudinal prospective study long-term follow-up . In EICS evaluable patient group generate enable comparison different surgical antimicrobial treatment concept . This study aim achieve : - Recruitment patient PJI joint prosthesis ( e.g . hip , knee , shoulder ankle joint ) participate study center . - Systematic collection clinical , radiological , pharmacological , laboratory , microbiological , treatment outcome data use standardized electronic CRF ( eCRF ) - Ensuring long-term follow-up patient evaluation regard infection , functional result health care cost . 2 . Background Orthopedic device increasingly use treatment degenerative joint disease fixation bone fracture grow population elderly . In United States , 800,000 primary hip knee arthroplasty perform 2006 ; year 2030 , demand primary total hip arthroplasty estimate increase 572,000 primary total knee arthroplasties 3.48 million procedure . Similar increase primary revision arthroplasty surgery observe Europe . Due high cost implantable device considerably morbidity associate surgical procedure , non-invasive approach prefer treatment modality , possible ( i.e . retention implant antibiotic therapy active biofilms ) . 3 . Purpose study The EICS multicenter European research project , include patient prosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) cohort representative Europe . The European Implant Cohort Study establish jointly Orthopedic Traumatology surgeon , Infectious Diseases specialist microbiologist select university non-university institution across Europe . RESEARCH PLAN 1 . Study design This investigator-initiated , open , prospective , multicenter observational study . Participating study center university non-university hospital across Europe , fulfill follow study condition : - Close collaboration infectious disease specialist , microbiologist orthopedic/trauma surgeon , - Availability appropriate microbiological method ( follow standard recommendation include sonication remove prosthesis ) , - Availability dedicate study team ( study nurse and/or research fellow ) regular eligibility screening , patient inclusion procedure , real-time data collection patient follow-up . 2 . Material Methods 1 . Patient recruitment , ethic study procedure All patient suspect PJI screen eligibility responsible research fellow participate study center . Potential study participant identify outpatient visit ( hospitalization ) admission . The data collect use electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) real-time ( within 5 day patient inclusion ) . The approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) obtain start study . Patients give inform consent study inclusion . The study protocol submit evaluation European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) . For local study coordinator train workshop organize start recruitment . In addition , hotline available question regard inclusion/exclusion procedure , data collection , treatment algorithm adverse event reporting . 2 . Data collection The follow data collect study inclusion , hospitalization follow-up visit ( 3 , 6 , 12 month thereafter usual clinical practice ) : demographic data , date primary implantation , type implant , previous joint surgery , presence potential risk factor PJI , clinical characteristic , microbiological , laboratory radiological data . At follow-up visit , functional outcome , adherence antimicrobial treatment protocol , potential drug-drug interaction possible side effect antimicrobial record . Patients appear schedule visit actively contact phone ( treat practitioner ) . 3 . Outcome evaluation The following outcome endpoint evaluate : - Primary outcome : Infection outcome . This determine infection-free interval end treatment . Infection-free status define absence clinical ( e.g . fistula ) , laboratory ( e.g . normal C-reactive protein ) radiological sign infection ( e.g . septic loosening ) . The expected `` cure rate '' , define infection-free interval 2 year , &gt; 80 % . The treatment outcome combine ( antimicrobial surgical ) treatment approach assess time-dependent manner use Kaplan-Meier survival method . - Secondary outcome : Functional outcome pharmacokinetic study . The functional assessment perform use joint-specific score involve range motion ( ROM ) , patient mobility / independency daily life subjective evaluation pain use pain scale ( 1-10 point ) . The expected functional outcome &gt; 60 % patient return previous life activity , &gt; 75 % reduction pain . Definitions variable • If clinical , laboratory radiographic sign suggest infection , preoperative ( e.g . arthrocentesis ) and/or intraoperative procedure ( e.g . arthroscopy arthrotomy ) perform proactively confirm exclude infection . In case uncertainty , diagnostic procedure repeat several day week ( depend severity symptom ) . • PJI define least one follow criterion present : ( ) presence sinus tract ( fistula ) , ( ii ) increase leukocyte count neutrophil percentage preoperative synovial fluid aspirate , ( iii ) acute inflammation histopathology periprosthetic tissue , ( iv ) visible pu around prosthesis , ( v ) growth synovial fluid , sonication periprosthetic tissue . • Further classification perform accord route infection ( intraoperative hematogenous ) clinical presentation ( acute versus chronic = low-grade ) . - Device outcome evaluate regard infection ( i.e . primary outcome = new infection different pathogen versus persistent infection organism ) functionality ( i.e . secondary outcome = concern non-infectious characteristic , aseptic device failure , periprosthetic implant fracture , pain , mobility ) . - The number variable , evaluate regard treatment outcome reduce follow 3 parameter : ( ) type joint prosthesis , ( ii ) type surgical procedure , ( iii ) type antimicrobial treatment . If patient treat accord predetermine treatment protocol ( i.e . study protocol deviation ) , patient evaluate separately . d. Microbiology diagnostic Microbiology analysis perform local microbiology laboratory participate study center . The antimicrobial susceptibility isolate microorganism test routine practice . Synovial fluid aspirate preoperatively ( appropriate ) multiple ( least 3 specimen ) periprosthetic tissue sample collect initial surgery . All isolated strain re-identified antimicrobial susceptibility re-tested central microbiology laboratory . In addition , explanted prosthesis ( part ) investigate sonication increase diagnostic yield biofilms detachment adherent microorganism . e. Pharmacokinetic study In select study center ( optional ) , population pharmacokinetic profile administer antimicrobial ( e.g . daptomycin , rifampicin , vancomycin ) plasma drainage fluid determine , quantify inter- intra-patient variability identify source variability drug concentration . f. Safety Adverse event Serious Adverse event ( SAE ) - An adverse event appearance worsen undesirable sign , symptom , medical condition occur start study medication even event consider related study medication . Medical conditions/diseases present start study medication consider adverse event worsen start study medication . Abnormal laboratory value test result constitute adverse event induce clinical sign symptom , consider clinically significant , require therapy . - An SAE define event : - Is fatal life-threatening - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity - Constitutes congenital anomaly/birth defect - Requires inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , unless hospitalization : routine treatment monitoring study indication , associate deterioration condition ; elective pre-planned treatment pre-existing condition unrelated indication study worsen since start daptomycin ; treatment emergency outpatient basis event fulfil definition SAE give result hospital admission ; social reason respite care absence deterioration patient 's general condition g. Data analysis Depending type data , result express mean ± SD number subject ( percentage ) . For method , factor influence functional status participant identify first bivariate survival analysis ( Kaplan-Meyer ) . This first analysis identify number potential risk factor , later confirm multivariate survival analysis ( Cox regression model ) . The result express relative risk 95 % confidence interval . The success rate two year method compare literature value chi-square test .</detailed_description>
