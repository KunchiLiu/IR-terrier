	<brief_summary>In Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , upper airway close sleep . This lead disrupt sleep ( wake night ) , daytime sleepiness , increase risk develop high blood pressure . Currently , best treatment obstructive sleep apnea sleep mask continuously blow air nose ( i.e . Continuous positive airway pressure [ CPAP ] treatment ) . While CPAP treatment stop upper airway close people , many people difficulty sleep mask place therefore use CPAP treatment . This research study conduct learn whether use combination therapy ( i.e . sedative oxygen therapy ) improve OSA severity alter trait responsible disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterize repetitive collapse 'obstruction ' pharyngeal airway sleep . These obstruction result repetitive hypopneas/apneas intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia , well surge sympathetic activity . Such process disturb normal sleep impair neurocognitive function , often result excessive daytime sleepiness decrease quality life . Furthermore , OSA associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality , make OSA major health concern . Current evidence suggest OSA pathogenesis involve interaction least four physiological trait comprise 1 ) pharyngeal anatomy propensity towards collapse 2 ) ability upper airway dilator muscle activate reopen airway sleep ( i.e . neuromuscular compensation ) , 3 ) arousal threshold sleep ( i.e . propensity hypopneas/apneas lead arousal fragmented sleep ) 4 ) stability ventilatory feedback loop ( i.e . loop gain ) . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) common treatment OSA often poorly tolerate ; ~50 % patient diagnose OSA continue therapy beyond 3 month . Given limitation , alternative approach test generally focus use oral appliance , surgery , recently pharmacological agent . However , alternate therapy , use alone monotherapy , rarely abolish OSA completely . This surprising give treatment focus primarily correct one trait ignore fact pathogenesis OSA multi-factorial . Thus investigator hypothesize patient could treat without CPAP one trait target ( i.e. , investigator take multi-factorial treatment approach ) . Such multi-factorial approach unusual Medicine . Many disorder diabetes , asthma , hypertension , cancer congestive heart failure treat one medication modality . In view , give CPAP OSA patient like treat every diabetic insulin , every asthmatic oral steroid - treatment , like CPAP , poorly tolerate ignore complexity underlie biology . The investigator recently publish technique measure four trait use repeated 'drops ' CPAP level sleep . Each trait measure way allow model-based prediction presence/absence OSA . With technique investigator demonstrate small group CPAP-treated OSA subject decrease sensitivity ventilatory feedback loop ( i.e . reduce loop gain ) approximately 50 % either acetazolamide oxygen reduces apnea/hypopnea index ( AHI ) half . Interestingly , model allow u make prediction , addition agent reduces loop gain , investigator also give drug increase arousal threshold least 25 % , investigator could potentially abolish OSA ( rather reduce severity 50 % ) . This great interest give investigator already show eszopiclone increase arousal threshold approximately 30 % associate improvement AHI . However , date study examine combination agent reduces loop gain ( i.e . oxygen ) one increase arousal threshold ( i.e . eszopiclone ) treatment OSA . To determine effect combination therapy four trait contribute model prediction OSA , well apnea severity . Specifically investigator ass : 1 . The physiological trait responsible OSA : 1 . Pharyngeal anatomy propensity towards collapse 2 . The ability upper airway dilator muscle activate reopen airway sleep ( i.e . neuromuscular compensation ) 3 . Arousal threshold sleep ( i.e . propensity hypopneas/apneas lead arousal fragmented sleep ) . 4 . Stability ventilatory control system feedback loop ( i.e . loop gain ) 2 . The severity OSA ( apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , percent time unstable breathing , sleep quality ) STUDY DESIGN : A single-blinded randomized control design use . Initially , participant randomize either treatment placebo arm clinical research polysomnography ( PSG ) ; initial PSGs constitute refer VISIT 1 ( see outcome measure ) . The purpose clinical PSG determine severity OSA ( i.e . AHI ) . The research PSG measure 4 physiological OSA trait . During treatment arm , PSGs ( i.e . clinical research ) participant give eszopiclone ( 3mg mouth ) take bed place oxygen throughout night . During placebo arm , subject give placebo take bed place room air sleep . Participants least 1-week washout period cross arm study whereby clinical research PSG repeat ; study constitute refer asVISIT 2 ( see outcome measure ) .</detailed_description>
