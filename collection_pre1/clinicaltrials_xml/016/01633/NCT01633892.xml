	<brief_summary>Traumatic facial injury , especially sustained military combat , characterize destruction bone soft tissue . While bony structure face reconstruct , difficult return soft tissue back original form . Many time , fat grafting , common cosmetic reconstructive procedure , use hope improve soft tissue deformity . Fat graft procedure person 's fat take area throughout body , usually thighs abdomen , small liposuction tube . The fat transferred area lose volume fullness . The fullness soft tissue area may decrease time transfer fat reabsorb body . Altering current fat grafting procedure , slightly , could lead less reabsorption last fullness soft tissue area outcome fat graft procedure . The investigator conduct research study help u improve surgical treatment people suffer facial soft tissue loss result trauma . The goal research study see person 's fat graft maintain fat time measure quality life 9 month post-surgical follow-up period . The total duration participation approximately 11-12 month . In study , investigator concentrate fat fat grafting procedure determine whether process maintain fat time . The area treat enhanced fat graft compare area treat standard care fat graft . At least two area face treat fat graft , ( standard care fat graft concentrate fat graft ) . This study second two clinical study University Pittsburgh use person 's fat graft concentration fat cell graft observe less fat resorption compare use fat graft alone . Each study use different concentration fat fat graft compare first clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Concentrated Endogenous Autologous Adipose Stromal Cells Fat Grafts Craniofacial Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Craniofacial injury serious psychosocial sequele affect quality life . Many individual suffer significant facial disfigurement injury experience psychological distress impairment function limited acute phase injury , long term period treatment , recovery , adjustment . Until recently , treatment disfigure craniofacial injury mostly limit surgical flap procedure , microsurgical tissue transfer , implantable prosthesis . However , method leave conspicuous scar face donor site , case implant lead complication associate foreign material . Autologous fat graft minimally invasive cannula procedure use decade common plastic surgery practice facial aesthetic procedure . This technique also promise treatment soft tissue reconstruction craniofacial trauma graft harvest injection minimally invasive . The treatment perform use small liposuction cannula aspirate fat tissue donor site , re-injecting fat recipient site specialize injection cannula . After harvest , prior injection , fat graft subject mechanical process step separate aqueous layer concentrate adipocytes . This often take form centrifugation filtering . The main problem autologous fat graft variable resorption graft volume time . As much 30-60 % graft volume diminish time . Many variable may influence behavior clinical fat graft , include harvest site , harvest technique , graft preparation , injection technique . Concentrating already present autologous adipose stromal cell within fat graft expect increase subject risk level beyond risk level application fat graft . We currently approve application fat graft concentrate autologous adipose stromal cell [ IRB # 10100293 ] . This proposal use increase concentration adipose stromal cell compare reference study ; increase risk subject anticipate . We hypothesize fat graft facial trauma , facilitate enhance graft quality high concentration endogenous autologous vascular adipose stromal cell graft tissue , enhance successful restoration tissue volume craniofacial form . The use high concentration autologous adipose stromal cell may lead low fat resorption rate may observe approve IRB study [ PRO10100293 ] . Additionally , hypothesize clinical result use concentrated autologous stromal vascular cell durable subject 's quality life score improve compare subject fat graft alone use historical control .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Aged 18 year older able provide inform consent . 2 . Have suffer injury result craniofacial volume defect could treat graft volume 3 100 cc lipoaspirate 3 . Be least 3 month postinjury postsurgery ( trauma procedure ) acute edema resolve 4 . Volume defect cover intact skin communicate oral cavity sinuses 5 . The three dimensional geometry volume defect would allow treatment lipoaspirate injection least two distinct treat area could discern gross examination radiographically ( e.g . treated region opposite side face , low face versus upper face , separate bony landmark zygoma . This would include ability treat uninjured region fat graft order obtain symmetry balance . 6 . Willing able comply follow examination , 1 . Age le 18 year 2 . Inability provide inform consent 3 . Craniofacial defect intend treatment open wound communicate oral cavity sinus ( note : presence defect set another defect ( ) meet treatment criterion exclude patient participate ) . 4 . Active infection anywhere body 5 . Diagnosed cancer within last 12 month and/or presently receive chemotherapy radiation treatment 6 . Known coagulopathy 7 . Systemic disease would render fat harvest injection procedure , along associate anesthesia , unsafe patient . 8 . Pregnancy 9 . Diagnosis Schizophrenia Bipolar Disorder</criteria>
