	<brief_summary>Background : - The experimental contrast agent [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide test cancer treatment image study . It design show tumor new blood vessel grow . Imaging study [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide may help predict well tumor respond therapy prevent growth new blood vessel . Researchers test [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide beginning treatment first treatment cycle . Participants may also third scan [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide 2 7 day start treatment look change blood vessel growth early starting therapy . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide predicting cancer treatment outcome . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age kidney cancer treatment stop tumor blood vessel growth . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Tumor image study biopsy perform start study . - Participants two positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide use scan . One scan happen start cancer treatment , second happen first treatment cycle . - Participants may also optional third PET/CT scan [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide . This scan take place 2 7 day begin therapy . - Depending location tumor , participant may optional magnetic resonance image scan look change tumor blood flow size . These scan do within 3 week [ 18 ] F-Fluciclatide PET/CT scan . - The scan monitor regular blood test vital sign . - Participants follow 1 year study look overall disease response therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Fluciclatide small cyclic peptide contain RGD tri-peptide , preferentially bind high affinity Alpha ( v ) Beta ( 3 ) integrins , up-regulated may regulate angiogenesis . - Alpha ( v ) Beta ( 3 ) integrins also express certain type tumor cell , renal cell cancer . - [ 18F ] Fluciclatide ( previously know 18F-AH111585 ) new radiopharmaceutical develop PET image , target Alpha ( v ) Beta ( 3 ) receptor . - Initial ongoing clinical study perform Europe ongoing multicenter phase 2 proof-of-concept study ( currently open NIH Clinical Center ) ; demonstrate date [ 18F ] Fluciclatide safe well tolerate . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To determine tumor uptake retention [ 18F ] Fluciclatide 1 cycle treatment target anti-angiogenic therapy renal cell cancer . ELIGIBILITY : - Adult subject ( great equal to18 year old ) , document renal metastatic renal cancer , least one tumor great equal to1 cm diameter outside liver , schedule enroll therapy protocol use anti-angiogenic agent . - The subject platelet count &gt; 100,000 time 10 ( 6 ) /L , hemoglobin value &gt; 9 g/dL , prothrombin time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) within &lt; 2 time normal limit . - The subject receive targeted anti-angiogenic agent within 60 day prior pre-treatment ( baseline ) [ 18F ] Fluciclatide PET image . DESIGN : This pilot , open-label , proof-of-concept study assess magnitude change [ 18F ] Fluciclatide PET tumor uptake follow treatment anti-angiogenic therapy . We expect enroll 30 evaluable patient single center study . When possible , data analysis stratify base anti-angiogenic agent receive . Subjects undergo least two [ 18F ] Fluciclatide PET/CT image study , one pre-therapy one follow completion 1 cycle therapy . An optional early post-therapy ( 2-7 day post therapy commencement ) [ 18F ] Fluciclatide PET/CT may perform . The magnitude [ 18F ] Fluciclatide uptake preand post- treatment PET/CT study evaluate determine measureable difference uptake . Subjects may also undergo standard care image study part routine tumor assessment specify refer protocol ( e.g . diagnostic CT , FDG-PET/CT , etc ) . Data subject refer therapy protocol review one year anti-angiogenic therapy initiation ass tumor response progression relationship [ 18F ] Fluciclatide PET/CT imaging . Some patient also undergo optional DCE-MRI scan target lesion subject comparison MR parameter [ 18F ] Fluciclatide parameter make .</detailed_description>
