	<brief_summary>Objective : In study develop apply image technique perform first three-dimensional ( 3-D ) measurement brain biomechanics mild head movement healthy human subject . Biomechanics application mechanic , physical principle action force apply object , anatomical structure and/or function organism . Such technique invaluable build computational model brain biomechanics , understand variability brain biomechanics across individual characteristic , age sex , determine brain sub-structures risk damage movement head accelerate , traumatic event . Study Population : Measurements perform 90 healthy men woman age 18-50 . Design : We build upon model pioneer collaborator , Dr. Philip Bayly . The model place human subject magnetic resonance ( MR ) scanner one two head support unit allow specific range motion . Each head support latch release subject , result either rotation head approximately 30 degree flexion-extension head approximately 4 degree . Although support weight motion repeatable subject relaxed , subject easily counteract weight . The result acceleration/deceleration small ( range normal activity , turn one 's head swimming ) validate used human investigation brain biomechanics . The subject repeat motion multiple time MR scan volition desire pace measure motion head brain . Outcome measure : This project pilot study evaluate potential extract three-dimensional estimate brain deformation , strain measurement , use MR imaging . A primary outcome project fast MR acquisition sequence measure 3-D brain deformation . The sequence evaluate apply protocol human subject , follow preliminary quantification reproducibility stability deformation measurement .</brief_summary>
