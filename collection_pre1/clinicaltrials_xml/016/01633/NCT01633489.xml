	<brief_title>Lysosomal Acid Lipase ( LAL ) Deficiency Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lysosomal Acid Lipase ( LAL ) Deficiency rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder ( LSD ) cause marked decrease lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) , enzyme break cholesteryl ester triglyceride lysosomes . Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency present infant ( historically call Wolman Disease ) medical emergency rapid disease progression period week typically fatal within first 6 month life . More commonly , LAL Deficiency present child adult presentation historically call Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease ( CESD ) . In general , data prevalence LAL Deficiency limit , overall prevalence disease population unclear . For presentation , LAL Deficiency associate significant morbidity mortality . Deficient LAL enzyme activity result lysosomal accumulation cholesteryl ester triglyceride . In liver , accumulation lead hepatomegaly , increased hepatic fat content , transaminase elevation signal chronic liver injury , progression fibrosis , cirrhosis , complication end stage liver disease . In spleen , LAL Deficiency result splenomegaly , anemia , thrombocytopenia . Lipid accumulation intestinal wall lead malabsorption growth failure . Dyslipidemia common elevate low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) triglycerides low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , associate increase liver fat content transaminase elevation . In addition liver disease , patient LAL Deficiency experience increase risk cardiovascular disease accelerate atherosclerosis . The LAL Deficiency Registry global registry , establish help improve care patient improve understanding disease long-term effectiveness therapeutic intervention include sebelipase alfa . As registry , become increasingly valuable collect information large , heterogeneous , 'real world ' population , LAL Deficiency Registry aim provide evidence help support patient care inform clinical practice . This Registry also conduct , part , fulfill post-marketing commitment requirement agree Sponsor condition sebelipase alfa approval EU USA .</detailed_description>
