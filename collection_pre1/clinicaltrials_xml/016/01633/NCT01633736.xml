	<brief_summary>This study 's main aim look target strength training muscle hip . Specifically consider whether targeted strength training effect strength specific muscle also ability stand one leg ( single leg balance ) well walk child cerebral palsy ? This study feasibility method investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Hip Strength Training Children With Cerebral Palsy ( CP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study focus functional change . The reasoning target strength training effective improve hip muscle contribution stability single leg balance may improve . This may functionally evident weight bear take say left leg gait ( percentage stance phase gait ) consequence oppose swing phase optimise measure stride . Thus research question strengthen rotate sideways move hip muscle improve walk child CP measure appropriate aspect gait ? Secondly , target strengthen also increase duration single leg balance simple easy use measure community without need specialise equipment ? The primary outcome measure use laboratory base 4 camera Codsmotion ( CODA ) biomechanical analysis system measure stride ( ) percentage duration stance phase gait ( b ) . Secondarily duration single leg balance term second record . Gross motor functional quality life also assess . The intervention strengthen implemented principle progressive resistance training . Children CP 's therapist would ask type intervention carry</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children CP age 716 year sufficient cognition undertake strength train program 1. nonambulation child unable walk 5 meter independently ( without walk aid ) , 2. low limb surgery within 12 month , 3. botox within 6 month , 4. oral muscle relaxant medication 5. significant learn difficulty 6 . Any concurrent condition would contraindicate progressive resistance training unmanaged high blood pressure , cardiac pathology uncontrolled epilepsy 7 . Where baseline assessment find weakness muscle investigation 8. concurrent within 6 month involvement research study 9 . Non consent General Practitioner ( GP ) notification .</criteria>
