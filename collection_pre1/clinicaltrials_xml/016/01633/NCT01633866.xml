	<brief_title>Pediatric Radio Frequency Coils Generic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric Magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technique limited unavailability specialize radio-frequency ( RF ) coil pediatric imaging . Typically , MR coil design general purpose adult image lack mechanical design , flexibility high channel count need pediatric imaging . Furthermore , pediatric patient often position decubitus prone rather supine . This make coil position even challenge often result image low SNR poor image quality . Many coil use clinical practice fix dimension fit within realm `` one-size fit , '' especially huge variation find pediatric patient population . MRI coil development optimization perform MR manufacturer research laboratory across world include Imaging Research Center ( IRC ) Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) . Coil development refinement involve evaluate new coil inert phantom image examination perform healthy participant patient . The focus study protocol evaluate design performance investigational coil patient healthy participant .</detailed_description>
