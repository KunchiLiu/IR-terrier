	<brief_title>Bortezomib Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By mechanism action i.e. , inhibit protein degradation , VELCADE target wide-range pathway relevant tumor progression therapy resistance . Preclinical data cell line indicate anti-tumor activity NSCLC . Preliminary work vivo ( animal model ) suggest enhanced anti-tumor effect combination cytotoxic agent commonly use treatment lung cancer , include gemcitabine CPT-11 additive tumor growth delay combine cisplatin paclitaxel . Platinum- non-platinum- base combination include new agent represent standard front-line treatment patient stage IIIB/IV NSCLC . However , despite introduction newer agent , efficacy cytotoxic chemotherapy seem reach plateau . The incorporation molecularly target agent NSCLC treatment likely improve treatment outcome . Recently , initial Phase 2 VELCADE combination gemcitabine/carboplatin first-line treatment NSCLC complete . A response rate 21 % impressive progression-free survival overall survival rate 5 11 month , respectively , report . Combining VELCADE currently approve standard regimen cisplatin/gemcitabine , may lead good response rate , TTP , OS chemotherapy alone . VELCADE combine gemcitabine cisplatin show safe phase I trial patient advance solid tumor . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) VELCADE 1 mg/m2 either weekly biweekly schedule combine gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 cisplatin 70 mg/m2 . Treatment generally well tolerated weekly regimen VELCADE associate less myelotoxicity . Plasma pharmacokinetic profile gemcitabine cisplatin alter VELCADE . Interestingly enough , among 27 patient NSCLC encourage response rate 37 % disease stabilization rate 52 % record . In trial VELCADE alone administer first treatment cycle examine molecular correlate VELCADE activity . Subsequent cycle include combination VELCADE cisplatin plus gemcitabine . Data phase I study VELCADE plus cisplatin/gemcitabine contribute selection drug dose patient enrol current study . Specifically , dose employ identified MTD level phase I study . The anti-tumor activity combination VELCADE cisplatin/gemcitabine first-line treatment NSCLC test study accord Simon 2-stage optimal design .</detailed_description>
