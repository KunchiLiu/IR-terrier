	<brief_summary>The investigator ' primary aim determine number participant handle treatment within specific safety parameter , determine number participant handle safely maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ( within 50-200 mg/BID dose range ) combine Veliparib radiation , well identify side effect intensity different dosing level . The investigator ' secondary aim determine number participant post-operative adverse event associate POPI well pathologic complete partial response rate patient treat POPI . The investigator ' exploratory aim serially assess apoptosis/proliferation biomarkers , gene protein expression profile correlation tumor response POPI . This primarily evaluate expansion cohort . Study Plan : It standard 3+3 dose find trial MTD define dose level &gt; 1 DLT observe 3-6 patient . Women node positive disease prior NAC &gt; 1.0 cm residual breast disease and/or clinically positive nodal disease NAC offer participation research phase study . Women residual disease &gt; 1cm +LN NAC ( Med Onc 's choice ) offer pre-operative Veliparib concurrent whole breast regional nodal irradiation . Four ( 4 ) dose level Veliparib evaluate concurrent whole breast regional nodal irradiation ( WB/RNI ) . The start dose Veliparib 50 mg BID , increase 50 mg increment maximum 200 mg BID deliver concurrently 235 cGy QD x 16 breast SCV/Axilla .

	<detailed_description>Neo adjuvant ( Primary ) chemotherapy revolutionize management locally advance breast . Two large prospective American study show NAC provide vivo chemo-sensitivity information , allow great percentage woman breast conserve therapy . Additionally importantly , two trial also show 20-30 % woman treat NAC achieve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) good disease free overall survival woman achieve pCR . Unfortunately , 70-80 % patient receive NAC achieve pCR many still must undergo mastectomy due insufficient partial response . Researchers attempt increase rate pCR add radiation NAC mixed response rate . The vary rate pCR study likely due various chemotherapeutic agent use time therapy yet also may represent limitation efficacy combine chemotherapy agent radiation . What need well agent potentiate effect preoperative radiation . One possible agent may potentiate effect radiation inhibitor Poly ( ADP-ribose ) -polymerase ( PARP ) . PARP nuclear enzyme recognize deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage facilitate DNA repair . Cancer cell often deficient DNA repair . Deficiencies DNA repair make cancer dependent PARP . An inhibitor PARP would hamper cancer cell 's DNA repair capability . So theoretically , efficacy DNA damaging agent , radiation chemotherapy , potentiate therapeutic modality combine PARP inhibition . Indeed , expect , PARP inhibitor ( PARPi ) , Veliparib , show pre-clinical study potentiate effect radiation chemotherapy several malignancy . Thus , hypothesize concurrent Veliparib pre-operative breast irradiation , woman residual disease NAC , result increase tumor response rate . This improved tumor response increase rate BCT , possibly , increase rate pCRs , also improve overall survival . However , hypothesis adequately test , one must assess safety combine radiation Veliparib . Consequently propose trial Pre-Operative PARPi Irradiation ( POPI ) woman incomplete response NAC . It standard 3+3 dose find trial MTD define dose level &gt; 1 DLT observe 3-6 patient . Women node positive disease prior NAC &gt; 1.0 cm residual breast disease and/or clinically positive nodal disease NAC offer participation study . Four ( 4 ) dose level Veliparib evaluate concurrent whole breast regional nodal irradiation ( WB/RNI ) . The start dose Veliparib 50 mg BID , increase 50 mg increment maximum 200 mg BID deliver concurrently 235 cGy QD x 16 breast SCV/Axilla . Once MTD determine evaluate safety expansion cohort bring total number patient treat MTD 20 .</detailed_description>
