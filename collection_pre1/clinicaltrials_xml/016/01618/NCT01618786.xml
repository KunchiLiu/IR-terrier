	<brief_title>Flooring Injury Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls number one cause unintentional injury among old adult Canada , responsible economic cost excess $ 1 billion CAD annually . In high-risk environment , long-term care ( LTC ) facility , 60 % resident experience least one fall year . Moreover , approximately 30 % fall LTC resident result injury , 3 5 % cause fracture . A promising strategy reduce incidence fall-related injury LTC facility decrease stiffness ground surface , subsequent force apply body part impact . Purpose-designed compliant flooring reduce force apply hip fall 35 % ( allow raw egg successfully bounce without crack ) . Yet , LTC facility floor design reduce impact fall . This study address gap . Resident room local LTC facility randomly assign installation compliant floor control ( non-compliant ) flooring . Following installation , primary secondary outcome , include fall-related injury fall , monitor 4 year compare resident room without compliant flooring . In addition , health resource utilization cost compare resident room without compliant flooring . Perceptions compliant floor assess among staff , resident , family .</detailed_description>
