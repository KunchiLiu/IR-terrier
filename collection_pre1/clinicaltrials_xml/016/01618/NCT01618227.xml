	<brief_summary>Loss wrist flexion extension common problem wrist forearm fracture may lead disability unsatisfactory outcomes fracture treatment . In many patient , range motion loss cause stiffness soft tissue . Such stiffness may loosen improve rehabilitation . Static progressive splint apply constant stretch upon wrist result stretch relaxation plastic deformation soft tissue . By alter splint 's bending angle , one incrementally increase force applied either wrist flexion extension . There data compare rehabilitation static-progressive splinting rehabilitation without static-progressive splint restoration wrist flexion extension wrist forearm fracture . Primary study hypothesis : Two month study enrollment patient use static progressive splint good wrist flexion extension patient use standard therapy technique . Secondary study hypothesis : 1 . Six month study enrollment , subject use static progressive splint good wrist flexion extension use standard therapy technique . 2 . Motion enrollment , 2 month 6 month enrollment correlate negative pain thought , pain anxiety , depression . 3 . Six month study enrollment , subject use static progressive splint few physical/occupational therapy visit use standard therapy technique . 4 . Six month study enrollment patient use static progressive splint few additional surgery patient use standard therapy technique . This study employ prospective randomize design . Subjects invite enroll routine office follow-up visit . Informed consent obtain . Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio rehabilitation without static progressive splinting . All subject standard rehabilitation program include physical occupational therapy home exercise throughout study . The static progressive splint prescribe accord randomization sequence . Upon receipt splint , subject instruct proper application use treat therapist representative company . Subjects instruct follow daily splint wear protocol provide device manufacturer . Use splint discontinue patient 's discretion plateau phase active range motion achieve ( define measurable gain active range motion achieve 30-day period ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon enrollment , form contain demographic injury-related information complete , subject fill Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire . Subjects evaluate negative pain thought , pain anxiety , depression . Study staff supervise assist questionnaire . Subjects evaluate 2 6 month enrollment routine office visit . The DASH questionnaire fill active wrist motion measure use standard goniometer research assistant involve care patient . The number physical/occupational therapy visit , additional surgery , ease splint application use , splint protocol compliance record . The investigator intend study effectiveness rather efficacy splint , mean subject free time pursue alternative treatment course discontinue splint wear . The investigator use intention treat analysis . Radiographs diagnostic study obtain discretion treat surgeon differ routine clinical care .</detailed_description>
