	<brief_summary>Acetic acid chromoendoscopy establish standard technique use detect dysplasia within gastrointestinal tract . Acetic acid spray help identify neoplasia highlight surface pattern , highlight vascular pattern process know aceto-whitening reaction , tissue take acetic acid turn white brief period slowly revert back normal colour . The neoplastic surface vascular pattern well describe , play big role recognition early cancer . The aceto-whitening reaction well describe differential timing neoplastic non-neoplastic area well understood . The investigator aim establish differential time disappearance aceto-whitening reaction healthy tissue , dysplastic tissue , intramucosal cancer invasive cancer acetic acid dye spray oesophagus colon . By understand good , investigator may able predict great accuracy whether highlight abnormal area cancer high grade dysplasia , whether low grade dysplasia inflammation , significant prognostic implication patient . The investigator hypothesize differential timing disappearance aceto-whitening reaction normal abnormal tissue could help detection gastrointestinal neoplasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aceto-whitening Assessment Gastrointestinal Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study . It standard practice within unit use acetic acid detection neoplasia . No patient would receive additional intervention would normally perform . We record surface vascular pattern acetic acid spray . As usual apply acetic acid spray Barrett 's epithelium time long take aceto whiten disappear . It time disappearance key study intervention . We biopsy area confirm diagnosis . Again standard practice patient deny intervention normally perform , extra intervention perform standard clinical practice . We correlate histology aceto-whitening disappearance time identify threshold time serve cut neoplastic non-neoplastic tissue . We hypothesise aceto-whitening reaction last much long normal epithelium Barrett 's oesophagus colon . This reaction much short area abnormal pathology like dysplasia cancer .</detailed_description>
