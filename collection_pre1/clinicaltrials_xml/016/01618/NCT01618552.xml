	<detailed_description>Many primary care patient struggle health behavior reduce depressive symptom , adhere prescribed treatment . Bolstering patient self-efficacy improve health behavior outcomes , include related depression . However , current self-efficacy intervention provide outside primary care , harness power therapeutic primary care provider ( PCP ) -patient relationship . Teaching PCPs employ self-efficacy enhance interview technique ( SEE IT ) patient would build upon exist therapeutic relationship , greatly increase reach self-efficacy enhancement . The randomized control trial ( RCT ) proposal examine whether , compare attention control condition , brief ( &lt; 1 hour ) office-based intervention practice PCPs lead significantly great use SEE IT unannounced follow-up SP encounter ( postintervention 3 month ) . The intervention deliver PCPs regular office hour standardize patient ( SP ) instructor . All study SPs portray patient depression diabetes , since condition commonly co-occur entail heavy burden health-enhancing behavior . Exploratory ( due limit statistical power ) analyse explore intervention effect follow outcomes among real patient co-occurring depression diabetes : self-efficacy depression diabetes self-care , actual self-care behavior ( e.g . medication adherence ) , symptom severity , health status . Further exploratory ( due limit statistical power ) analyse explore intervention effect follow outcomes among real patient various chronic condition ( ie , limited depression diabetes ) : self-care self-efficacy , actual self-care behavior , symptom severity , health status . Pre- post-RCT focus group stakeholder ( PCPs , office staff , patient , SP instructor ) guide refinement SEE IT intervention . The propose research activity inform design ( e.g . sample size ) conduct future R01-funded , multi-center , cluster RCT finalize intervention , adequately powered examine effect range patient outcome ; sustainability effect PCP interviewing time ; generalizability practice setting common co-morbid mental health physical illness cluster . The SEE IT intervention begin address broad health need individual depression primary care , unique potential reduce tremendous burden mental illness relate morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
