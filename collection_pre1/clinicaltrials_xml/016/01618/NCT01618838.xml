	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy well-established treatment modality clinically localized prostate cancer . Men choose undergo radiation treatment prostate cancer live side effect many year . Attempts make protect surround tissue deliver high dosage radiation cancer . With rectum close prostate , many patient still suffer side effect cause radiation injury rectum , especially receive conventional external beam radiotherapy . CyberKnife FDA approve radiosurgical devise . Its flexible robotic arm allow radiation beam deliver different direction , provide highly conformal , uniform dose steep dose gradient . Therefore , treatment CyberKnife radiosurgical system minimize toxicity surround structure . CyberKnife System also incorporate dynamic track system allow robot correct target therapeutic beam treatment . These improvement allow dose escalation within prostate le normal tissue toxicity . The purpose study estimate proportion patient endoscopically detectable telangiectasia indication radiation injury rectum , CyberKnife Treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy well-established treatment modality clinically localized prostate cancer . Current technique include conventional external beam radiotherapy intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . The efficacy conventional external beam radiation treatment ( 60-70 Gy 2 Gy fraction ) use several uniform field document . The 10-year disease-free survival rate patient disease confine prostate pre-PSA era approximately 50-70 % . Analysis data suggest dose escalation could improve local control prostate cancer . On average , men choose undergo radiation therapy treatment prostate cancer live side effect therapy many year . Chronic proctitis may occur radiotherapy ( RT ) pelvic region . According publish series , clinically occur radiation therapy localize prostate cancer frequency 5-20 % . It occur month year treatment ( average 8-12 month ) large majority within two year follow radiation therapy . Patient characteristic , history inflammatory bowel disease chronic anticoagulation therapy , may increase individual patient 's risk clinically significant proctitis . Patients radiation-induced proctopathy describe symptom rectal pain , diarrhea , urgency , rectal bleeding , increase frequency bowel movement . Endoscopic evaluation show telangiectasia , congest mucosa ulcer . Rectal bleeding occur neovascular telangiectasia see 60 % patient receive conventionally fractionate radiation therapy . The symptom probably develop decreased rectal compliance associate rectal wall fibrosis . These symptom , current report , often classify accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria grade late gastrointestinal side effect . Due proximity rectum bladder prostate , use conventional technique , prescription dose limited 65-70 Gy . Although attempt make protect rectum , incidence rectal bleeding unacceptable dos great 70 Gy ( 20 % ) . The risk proctitis rectal bleeding appear dependent upon radiation dose volume rectum high dose area . Radiation Oncologists ' effort optimize therapeutic ratio prostate cancer treatment therefore direct toward limit high dose volume prostate escalation dose within volume . Intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) widely use technology achieve goal . It accomplish modulate radiation beam intensity within radiation field accordance optimization algorithm . This allowed great dose-escalation without evident increase acute complication , although follow-up short fully assess control complication rate . Whether IMRT provide degree conformity prove eradicate prostate cancer high probability spar local structure yet unresolved . Late Rectal Mucosal Injury Following CyberKnife RadioSurgery Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer . The type , extent incidence rectal mucosal injury follow CyberKnife radiosurgery currently unknown . The severity clinical proctitis follow radiation therapy commonly document use NCI Common toxicity criteria/RTOG/EORTC . Unfortunately , clinical proctitis low sensitivity detect rectal mucosal injury . Endoscopy give accurate estimate extent incidence rectal mucosal injury . The Vienna rectoscopy score ( VRS ) develop quantify rectal mucosal change follow radiation therapy . In study , endoscopic evaluation mucosal damage CyberKnife treatment document correlated gastrointestinal side effect treatment planning parameter .</detailed_description>
