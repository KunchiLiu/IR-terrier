	<brief_summary>This trial go evaluate efficacy safety two regimen DX ( docetaxel plus capecitabine ) XELOX ( oxaliplatin plus capecitabine ) adjuvant chemotherapy stage IIIb-IIIc gastric cancer patient curative D2/D2+ operation , investigate optimal adjuvant regimen extremely high risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Adjuvant Chemotherapy High Risk Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Operation curative treatment gastric cancer patient . However , rate recurrence high 60 % . The 5 year 's overall survival patient stage IIIb advance stage still poor approximately 8-28 % . Adjuvant chemotherapy critical improving efficacy . Unfortunately , optimal adjuvant regimen identify yet . The standard adjuvant treatment American European patient accept widely Asia area different operation procedure patient 's tolerability . Results two critical trial indicate S-1 alone Japanese standard adjuvant chemotherapy could improve survival stage IIIb advance stage gastric cancer patient Korean standard regimen XELOX could . This implied intensive chemotherapy must use patient higher risk relapse . The proportion stage IIIb-IIIc Chinese gastric cancer patient much large Japan Korean . However , randomize trial focus extremely high risk relapse stage IIIb stage IIIc patient perform , standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen clear need investigate . Docetaxel base combination one effective regimen advance gastric cancer . The combination docetaxel 5-FU find similar efficacy ECF regimen along milder toxicity . Capecitabine prove good alternative infusional 5-FU . So , docetaxel plus capecitabine seem promising adjuvant regimen high risk stage IIIb-IIIc gastric cancer patient . But still need verified . This trial go evaluate efficacy safety two regimen DX XELOX adjuvant chemotherapy stage IIIb-IIIc gastric cancer patient curative D2/D2+ operation , investigate optimal adjuvant regimen extremely high risk patient .</detailed_description>
