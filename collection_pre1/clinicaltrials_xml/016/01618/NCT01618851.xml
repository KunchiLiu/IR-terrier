	<detailed_description>This phase II study design prospectively evaluate efficacy morbidity IMRT CyberKnife radiosurgical boost clinically localized prostate cancer . Patients clinically localized prostate cancer treat three radiosurgical treatment ( 6.5 Gy per fraction PTV ) follow IMRT ( 45 Gy 25 fraction ) . Treatment complete 6-7 week period . The hypothesis patient clinically localize adenocarcinoma prostate , CyberKnife Radiosurgery deliver prostate efficacious acceptable toxicity combination IMRT . Subjects toxicity evaluation AUA score last day treatment . At 1 month follow treatment , subject assess acute toxicity fill AUA form , SF-12 , EPIC-26 , SHIM Utilization Sexual Rx/Devices . At 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month interval ( every 6 month thereafter , year 5 , annually year 10 , investigator opt continue past year 5 ) , subject see evaluate , include history , physical exam , performance status , PSA , toxicity evaluation , AUA score . In addition , 6 month , 12 month annually thereafter , SF-12 , EPIC-26 , SHIM Utilization Sexual Medications/Devices administer . A prostate biopsy perform time biochemical local clinical failure , encourage 2 year follow treatment time distant failure . A bone scan perform time biochemical failure , subject develop sign symptom suggest metastatic disease . Acute side effect ( â‰¤ 90 day treatment start ) assess use NCI Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 .</detailed_description>
