	<brief_summary>General Anesthesia usually produce intravenous agent maintain breathe agent till surgery complete . However , recent trend produce maintain general anesthesia solely intravenous agent , propofol , view advantage . This delivery method call Total Intravenous Anesthesia ( TIVA ) . The depth general anesthesia measure anesthetic depth monitoring device call Bispectral Index ( BIS ) . The use BIS determine depth anesthesia well establish whenever breathing agent use maintain general anesthesia . However , validity use BIS TIVA adequately investigate . This study compare BIS value different dos TIVA order establish correlation two . If correlation establish , BIS monitor safely recommended determine anesthetic depth TIVA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-anesthetic Management : This research initiate receive approval Institution Review Board , inform write consent obtain patient . Forty patient age range 18-65 year present elective orthopedic gynecological procedure recruit . Both male female patient consider . Only patient American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I , II III include . Patients pregnant uncontrolled hypertension BP 180/100 , unstable angina , chronic obstructive lung disease require oxygen therapy home , end-stage liver kidney disease exclude . In addition , orthopedic surgery need patient prone position eligible investigation . Patients medication allergy propofol food allergy egg soy , since egg lecithin soy milk constituent propofol preparation , exclude . In order complete data collection , surgical procedure schedule last three hour consider study . Anesthetic Management : Routine anesthetic care , intravenous line placement American Society Anesthesiologists ' standard monitoring , applied patient . In addition , non-invasive Bispectral Index ( BIS ) sensor place patient 's forehead connect monitor . Midazolam ( 25mcg/kg ) fentanyl ( 1mcg/kg ) administer establish preanesthetic sedation analgesia , respectively . Lidocaine 40mg give attenuate propofol-induced injection pain . Thereafter , Total Intravenous Anesthesia ( TIVA ) induce propofol ( 2mg/kg ) , tracheal intubation facilitate neuromuscular blocking agent choose attend anesthesiologist . The skeletal muscle relaxation maintain need surgical procedure . The TIVA maintain propofol infusion , approximately half-hour , 160mcg/kg/min minor adjustment , need , maintain patient 's vital sign within ± 20 % baseline . Once steady state establish , propofol infusion rate reduce 140mcg/kg/min maintain approximately 15-30 min , follow infusion rate increase 180mcg/kg/min maintained period time . Thereafter , propofol infusion rate return 160mcg/kg/min . This exercise repeat 120mcg/kg/min 200mcg/kg/min patient 's vital sign permit . In addition , remifentanil infusion rate 0.02 - 0.2mcg/kg/min administer provide surgical analgesia general anesthetic period . The infusion rate remifentanil tailor demand surgical stimulation . During study period , attend anesthesiologist option deviate study protocol adjust propofol infusion rate , need , maintain patient 's vital sign within ± 20 % baseline need arises . An independent observer continuously monitor BIS value time frame . Following study period need collect require data , attend anesthesiologist option continue general anesthesia either TIVA traditional inhalational anesthetic . The reversal neuromuscular blockade subsequent tracheal extubation , conclusion surgery , perform use customary criterion employ anesthetic practice . In addition , routine protocol use surgical infection prevention attenuation postoperative pain vomit follow .</detailed_description>
