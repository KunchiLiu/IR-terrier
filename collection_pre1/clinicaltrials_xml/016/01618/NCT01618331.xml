	<brief_title>Protein Supplementation Exercise Patients With FSH Muscular Dystrophy- Randomized Placebo Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate response protein-carbohydrate supplementation regular exercise patient FSHD . All patient test 12 week cycle-ergometer exercise . Maximal oxygen consumption functional 6 min walk test ( 6MWT ) use primarily effect goal . Secondary effect goal risk fall daily activity level . We measure manuel muscle strength , balance test , 5-time-up-and-down-chair-test , 14 steps-stair-test , accelerometer measuring , daily activity level questionnaire SP36 . We use blind randomized control trail . The intervention 12 week regular exercise consumption post-exercise drink . The exercise consist 30 session 30 minute moderate exercise cycle-ergometer . After exercise session patient consume protein non-caloric placebo drink .</detailed_description>
