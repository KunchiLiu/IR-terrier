	<detailed_description>Fermented Papaya Preparation ( FPP ) possess antioxidant property , provide benefit age-related complication . FPP also know protect red blood cell ( RBCs ) oxidative damage help protect severe form thalassemia . Several independent observation convergently point toward hypothesis treatment papaya preparation may facilitate wound heal response . Chronic wound patient diabetes represent major public health problem . Previous study investigator demonstrate wound-site macrophage patient diabetes compromise ability support wind healing . Recently , laboratory report first evidence demonstrate FPP may improve diabetic wound outcomes specifically influencing response wound-site macrophage subsequent angiogenic response . FPP long track record safe human consumption . The objective current study determine whether FPP able improve inducible respiratory burst outcomes peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) participant diabetes . Our investigator recently report supplementation standardize ferment papaya preparation ( FPP ) adult diabetic mouse improve dermal wound heal outcome . The production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) type 2 diabetic ( T2DM ) PBMC markedly inhibit compare PBMC non-diabetic donor . We observe ex vivo FPP supplementation correct inhibition ROS production PBMC T2DM donor . Therefore , base observation , investigator propose study outcome FPP supplementation patient diabetes .</detailed_description>
