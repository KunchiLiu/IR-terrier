	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , parallel , control study compare efficacy outcome retreatment pulmonary Tuberculosis ( TB ) Guangzhou group use pretreatment susceptibility test selection chemotherapy regimens another group without use pretreatment susceptibility test result . The investigator hypothesize select drug treatment basis know susceptibility test would lead improved outcome compare empiric treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Directly Observed Therapy Short Course-Plus Versus DOTS Retreatment Relapsed Pulmonary Tuberculosis Guangzhou</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim are:1 ) To evaluate efficacy outcome retreatment pulmonary TB Guangzhou use pretreatment susceptibility test selection chemotherapy regimen &amp; 2 ) To study predictive factor unfavourable outcome retreatment pulmonary TB Guangzhou , unfavourable outcome include treatment failure relapse . The patient randomize either ) The DOTS strategy consist follow measure : political commitment , case detection bacteriologic evaluation , standardize treatment supervision patient support , effective drug supply system , report record system allow assessment treatment ; b ) The DOTS-Plus strategy include additional measure include continuous drug resistance surveillance , culture , drug susceptibility test TB patient , tailor individual drug regimen use first second-line drug . The Primary end point 18-month combine treatment failure/ relapse ( unfavourable outcome ) among rifampicin resistant group . Secondary endpoint include 30-month combined treatment failure/ relapse ( unfavourable outcome ) among rifampicin resistant group , multidrug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) case retreatment case ; Sputum smear/conversion rate 2m , 3m , 8m , 12m , 18m , 24m ; Drug resistance rate various drug particular rifampicin , rate MDR-TB . The predictive factor unfavourable treatment outcome ( include failure relapse ) analyse . The management retreatment case DOTS alone often problematic , especially resistance rifampicin , treatment failure / relapse resistance might result . With implementation `` DOTS-plus '' strategy , Hong Kong ( HK ) achieve low MDR-TB prevalence around 1 % . This study provide important data predictor treatment failure/ relapse retreatment case whether DOTS-plus strategy effectively reduce failure/relapse rate prevalence rate MDR-TB Guangzhou . The project provide useful data surveillance , epidemiology public health control TB regional ( cross-border ) significance .</detailed_description>

Age &lt; 18 yr ; New TB case ( without past history antiTB treatment ) exclude much low risk MDRTB retreatment case .</criteria>
