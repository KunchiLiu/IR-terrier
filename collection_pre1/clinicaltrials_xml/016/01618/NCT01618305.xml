	<brief_title>Evaluating Response Two Antiretroviral Medication Regimens HIV-Infected Pregnant Women , Who Begin Antiretroviral Therapy Between 28 36 Weeks Pregnancy , Prevention Mother-to-Child Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While many ARV medication combination regimens available treat HIV-infected people , number ARV medication study HIV-infected pregnant woman prevention mother-to-child transmission remain limited . HIV-infected pregnant woman begin take ARV medication late pregnancy require effective therapy reduce risk transmit HIV child . Currently , data available compare effect non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) integrase inhibitor ( two class ARV medication ) pregnant woman . The purpose study compare safety , tolerance , virologic pharmacologic response two different medication regimen , include NNRTI integrase inhibitor , pregnant HIV-infected woman begin ARV therapy late pregnancy ( i.e. , gestational age 28 36 week ) . Participants study randomly assign one two arm . Participants Arm A receive lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice day efavirenz 600 mg night . Participants Arm B receive lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice day raltegravir 400 mg twice day . All participant receive assign medication study entry delivery . Participants attend study visit entry Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 ; thereafter , every two week labor delivery . Study visit include medical history review , physical examination , questionnaire , blood collection , vaginal swab procedure . While participant labor , continue receive study medication . Some participant may receive additional alternate medication accord local standard care/guidelines . Participants physical examination blood collection . After delivery , woman continue receive ARV medication accord local guideline . Participants attend study visit follow delivery Weeks 2 4 , 6 , 16 , 24 , include medical history review , physical examination , blood collection . One study visit include vaginal swab procedure . Some participant may vaginal specimen stored future research . Participants ' baby receive ARV medication prescribe baby ' doctor . Study visit baby occur birth ; Weeks 2 4 , 6 , 16 , 24 . Each study visit include medical history review , physical examination , blood collection . Select visit include oral nasopharyngeal swab collection .</detailed_description>
