	<brief_summary>Subjects screen enter placebo-only 2-week run-in period constipation symptom evaluate disallowed product ( e.g . probiotic ) must discontinue . Following successful completion run-in period , subject randomize probiotic ( high low-dose group ) placebo . Subjects consume assigned product daily 6 week . Subjects undergo abdominal x-ray study day 0 42 assess transit time examination precede 6 day radiopaque Sitz marker ingestion . Subject diary use collect bowel movement frequency , stool consistency , concomitant medication , adverse event day trial . Stool sample collect baseline end study assess fecal probiotic count . PAC-QOL , WCS , GSRS questionnaires administered baseline day 42 . 24-hour food recall administer day 0 42 follow parameter assess : total calorie , carbohydrate , fat , protein , fiber , liquid intake . Weekly physical activity recall complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint : Whole gut transit time The primary endpoint clinical trial whole gut transit time , assess use abdominal x-ray ( supine anteroposterior kidney-ureter-bladder , KUB ) day 0 42 . Each subject ingest 24 radiopaque Sitz marker day 6 consecutive day time day prior abdominal x-ray day 0 42 , also take time day marker take . The number marker present right , leave , rectosigmoid colon sum yield total marker count . Whole gut transit time calculate use classic film estimate describe follow formula : WGTT = ni x ( t/N ) 19 , 20 ni number marker observe x-ray , time marker ingestion hour , N total number marker ingest day . Thus , study , t/N equal 1 ( 24 marker per capsule/24 hour marker ingestion ) , WGTT , therefore , equal total marker count 19 , 20 . Marker count identify single radiologist site remain blinded subject treatment assignment . The methodology safe , noninvasive , two abdominal x-ray require study collectively expose subject radiation dose approximately 140 millirem ( equivalent 1.4 millisievert ) . The overall lifetime risk radiation dosage may cause cancer approximately 1 4,000 woman age 18 year , 1 6,000 men age 18 year , 1 20,000 woman age 70 year , 1 25,000 men age 70 year . Similar abdominal x-ray methodology utilize similar study adult age 18 year old 21 , 22 . Secondary Endpoint : Patient Assessment Constipation Quality Life ( PAC-QoL ) The PAC-QoL ( Appendix A ) 28-question survey measure impact constipation daily life past 2 week . The question comprise four subscales ( worry concern , physical discomfort , psychosocial discomfort , satisfaction ) overall scale . Multinational study demonstrate PAC-QoL internally consistent , reproducible , valid , responsive improvement time 23 . Subjects complete PAC-QoL day 0 42 . Secondary Endpoint : Wexner Constipation Score ( WCS ) The Wexner Constipation Score ( WCS ) ( Appendix B ) 8-question survey assess frequency bowel movement , strain , incomplete evacuation , abdominal pain , time need defecation , assistance defecation , unsuccessful attempt , duration constipation . The WCS validate questionnaire since WCS score correlate well objective physiologic finding constipate patient 24 . Subjects complete WCS day 0 42 . Secondary Endpoint : Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale ( GSRS ) The GSRS ( Appendix C ) 15-item instrument design assess common GI symptom 25 . It five subscales ( reflux , diarrhea , constipation , indigestion , abdominal pain ) subscale score range 1 ( discomfort ) 7 ( severe discomfort ) . Higher score represent high symptom burden . Subjects complete GSRS day 0 42 . Secondary Endpoint : Stool frequency Throughout study , subject record number defecation per day diary throughout study . The stool frequency endpoint absolute change weekly stool group second week run-in period sixth study week . Secondary Endpoint : Stool Consistency Stool consistency rat Bristol Stool Scale Form 26 ( Appendix D ) . Subjects grade stool use daily diary throughout study . The stool consistency endpoint mean change group second week run-in period sixth study week . Secondary Endpoint : Fecal Probiotic Count Stool sample collect baseline end study assess fecal probiotic count via live culture , include total lactobacillis count total bifidobacterium count . At Day 0 visit follow randomization , subject provide two separate stool collection kitsâ€”one use baseline one used end supplementation period . After receipt kit , subject must provide first stool sample take first dose study product , regardless length time need bowel movement . The stool sample provide study site Day 0 subject may collect first stool thereafter ship sample provide refrigerated container laboratory analysis . Once first stool sample provide , subject may begin consume study product . During final 3 day supplementation period ( i.e . Day 40 , 41 , 42 ) , subject must provide another stool sample ship sample provide refrigerated container laboratory analysis . This must complete return site Day 42 assessment . Secondary Endpoint : Adverse Events Adverse event ( AEs ) assess throughout clinical study . The main safety endpoint proportion subject group report one AEs time study . Please see Section 6 additional detail AE assessment . Ancillary Outcome : International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) -short version The International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) -short version validate questionnaire suitable quantify physical activity level adult ( Appendix E ) 27 . Ancillary Outcome : 24-hour Food Recall A 24-hour food recall complete order quantify total calorie , carbohydrate ( g ) , fat ( g ) , protein ( g ) , fiber ( g ) , liquid intake ( ml ) . The food recall must take place weekday ( Monday Thursday ) . Subjects must record food beverage consume well quantity ( recorded weight volume ) . Ancillary Outcome : Concomitant medication use Throughout study , subject record use concomitant medication , require , need rescue medication day diary .</detailed_description>
