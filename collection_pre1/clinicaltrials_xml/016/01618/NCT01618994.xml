	<brief_summary>A study determine whether complete rigorous simulation protocol could provide novice robotic surgeon actual advance surgical skill operate room setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Study Robotic Surgery Simulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine whether group surgeon otherwise naive robotic technique could demonstrate proficiency first robotic supracervical hysterectomy receive simulator pig lab training . Primary outcome measure : As measured time spend surgeon console begin hysterectomy end cervical amputation . Secondary Outcome measure : 1 . Blood loss- measure blood suction canister throughout hysterectomy end amputation discount irrigation volume . 2 . Surgical skill rating- All procedure record rat blinded investigator accord standardized surgical skill evaluation sheet . 3 . Surgeon console biometrics- As measure controller movement grip 4 . Novice robotic surgeon data : Descriptive Operative data surgeon participate robotic simulator training . Methods : To create simulator protocol , 5 robotic surgeon ( average &gt; 75 robotic case per year ) perform 28 simulation module available da Vinci Skills Simulator . To establish `` expert benchmark '' , pick 10 simulator module think beneficial robotic novice ' , perform 10 module best ability &gt; 5 time . The data use create benchmarks parameter 10 module take account ( i.e . time completion ) . Thus `` Morristown Protocol '' established- whereby successful completion protocol require passing every parameter 10 simulator module expert level . We recruit community board-certified OB-GYN 's completely naive robotics offer full robotic train free-of-charge long could pass `` Morristown Protocol '' first step training process . These `` study surgeon '' give 24/7 access da Vinci Skills Simulator simply ask complete protocol pace . Within week , go standardized Intuitive Surgical pig lab perform first ever robotic surgery- supracervical hysterectomy- main outcome measure . These case perform use dual-console daVinci system one senior author console ready step necessary . Two set comparative benchmark surgical procedure establish . Our `` expert surgeon '' perform supracervical hysterectomy study- group `` control surgeon '' . These `` control surgeon '' full robotic privilege average 2 case per month never use simulator . Operative time , EBL , blind skill assessment ( video ) compare case among 3 surgeon group use t-tests .</detailed_description>
