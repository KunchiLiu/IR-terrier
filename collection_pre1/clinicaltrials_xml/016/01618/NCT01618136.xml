	<brief_summary>Overall Design : This multicenter , open-label , Phase 1/2 study conduct three arm ( describe ) . Each arm conduct two part : Phase 1 part include dose escalation Phase 2 part include four cohort specific disease indication . Phase 1 also include food effect study E7449 single agent . Once MTD Phase 1 single agent arm Phase 1 combination arm study achieve , sponsor submit relevant safety information recommend Phase 2 dose IRB/Health Authorities . Arm 1 : E7449 administer single agent . Arm 2 : E7449 administer combination TMZ . Arm 3 : E7449 administer combination carboplatin paclitaxel</brief_summary>

Females must lactate pregnant Screening Baseline ( document negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ betahCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit betahCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( least 12 month consecutive amenorrheic , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . Females childbearing potential must unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day prior study entry must agree use highly effective method contraception ( e.g. , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . If currently abstinent , subject must agree use doublebarrier method describe becomes sexually active study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . Females use hormonal contraceptive must stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week prior dose must continue use contraceptive study 30 day study drug discontinuation . 12 . Male subject must successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner must meet criterion ( i.e. , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception throughout study period 30 day study drug discontinuation ) . 13 . Voluntary agreement provide write informed consent willingness ability comply aspects protocol . For Phase 2 Cohort 1 ( Platinumsensitive recurrent highgrade serous ovarian cancer ) : 14 . Histologically confirm platinumsensitive recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer locally advance metastatic disease progression standard treatment .
