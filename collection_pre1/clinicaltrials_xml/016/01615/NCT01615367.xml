	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity mortality bipolar disorder , yet empirically validate psychosocial intervention manage risk factor CVD BD develop . The purpose study develop test feasibility integrate treatment decrease CVD risk factor , explore whether intervention improve overall function mood symptom . The design treatment integrate theory Nutrition strategy , Exercise intervention , Wellness Treatment ( NEW Tx ) address risk factor CVD co-occur bipolar disorder . NEW Tx include novel intervention strategy three module , well modify tailor empirically-supported strategy bipolar disorder . The primary hypothesis NEW Tx feasible deliver , acceptable population , associated improvement CVD risk factor ( i.e. , waist circumference ) . Exploratory analysis examine predictor treatment response effect NEW Tx mood symptom overall functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose Nutrition , Exercise , Wellness Treatment ( NEW Tx ) research develop test feasibility acceptance theoretically integrated treatment address impact medical comorbidity individual bipolar disorder ( BD ) , explore efficacy , whether improves overall functioning symptom , well examine potential moderator mediator treatment response . A.Primary Aims Aim 1 : Feasibility Acceptance NEW Tx Nonrandomized Trial . Hypothesis 1a : A preliminary study whether NEW Tx feasible regard recruitment , retention , blind assessment , therapist adherence NEW Tx . Hypothesis 1b : Participants report high satisfaction treatment acceptability study duration nonrandomized trial . Aim 2 : Feasibility Acceptance NEW Tx Evaluation Randomized Pilot Trial . Hypothesis 2a : A pilot study whether NEW Tx feasible regard recruitment , randomization , retention , blind assessment , therapist adherence NEW Tx . Hypothesis 2b : Participants report high satisfaction treatment acceptability study duration randomize pilot trial . B. Exploratory Aims Aim 3a : Reducing Medical Burden Randomized Pilot Trial . Pilot test efficacy NEW Tx improve medical burden use Framingham Risk Score ( FRS ) . Hypothesis 3a : Over course 20-weeks ( 18 session ) NEW Tx group lower FRS compare treatment usual ( TAU ) randomize pilot trial . Aim 3b : Symptoms Functioning Randomized Pilot Trial . Examine efficacy NEW Tx improve function symptom BD . Hypothesis 3b : Over course 20-weeks ( 18 session ) NEW Tx group improve functioning mood symptom compare TAU randomize pilot trial . Aim 3c : Moderator Mediator NEW Tx Randomized Pilot Trial . Investigate potential moderator mediator treatment response . Hypothesis 3c.1 : Individuals high baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 moderate treatment effect size medical burden ( FRS ) randomize pilot trial , NEW Tx low FRSs . Hypothesis 3c.2 : Mastery diet exercise modules NEW Tx mediate association NEW Tx improvement medical burden ( FRS ) .</detailed_description>
