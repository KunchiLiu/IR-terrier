	<brief_title>Evaluation Antihyperalgesic Effect Tapentadol Two Human Experimental Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate exploratory antihyperalgesic effect single dose Palexia® IR ( Tapentadol ) two human experimental model 1 ) cold mechanical ( pinprick ) hyperalgesia topical application menthol high-concentration [ 40 % ] 2 ) heat mechanical ( pinprick ) hyperalgesia topical apply capsaicin [ 0.6 % ] comparison placebo . Therefore , cold , heat mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia determine parameter Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) . These parameter cold heat pain threshold , mechanical pain threshold sensitivity well dynamic mechanical allodynia . Further , area dynamic mechanical allodynia pinprick-hyperalgesia determine timepoint QST-assessement .</detailed_description>
