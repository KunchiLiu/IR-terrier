	<detailed_description>Cancer lead cause death North Carolina ( NC ) ; 17,400 death attributable cancer 2009 . Obesity also widespread problem ; 65 % NC adult overweight obese 2009 . Obesity link risk several cancer , notably breast colon cancer , also decrease survival rate . Thus , due prevalence linkage obesity major cancer , help adult lose weight necessary reduce cancer burden statewide . Fortunately , modest weight loss 5 10 percent total body weight show improve health achievable behavioral lifestyle modification program , consider `` gold standard '' intervention . To date , weight loss via lifestyle modification show effective , cost-effective , pharmaceutical intervention reduce risk chronic disease . However , `` gold standard '' program time resource intensive ; involve weekly face-to-face ( F2F ) session group 10-20 participant , minimum , 16-24 week follow bi-weekly contact 2 year . To combat problem investigator , include investigative team , explore use Internet deliver weight loss program . Internet program modestly effective produce 4-7 % weight loss ( 6 month ) roughly ½ intensive F2F program achieve . Internet program involve substantial human contact via e-mail produce best outcomes , yet limit dissemination , involve automate feedback suffer low utilization time . What may optimal hybrid model involve few F2F visit couple Internet program . We currently investigate alternative F2F approach whereby participant attend F2F visit per month , phase 1 6-step , step care approach treat obesity ( R01 HL084400 ) . The initial result promise ; 3 month weight loss differ significantly monthly F2F approach weekly F2F approach ( -15.23 + 10.22 lb . weekly vs. -12.32 + 10.26 lb . monthly ; p &gt; .05 ) . While monthly program ¼ visit standard treatment approach , group size 20 still severely limits dissemination . Delivering monthly F2F approach much large group ( approximately 200 ) , couple Internet program session , may represent effective disseminable approach achieve weight loss NC community . A standard behavioral intervention base DPP Premier trial adapt protocol . Behavioral weight control approach found teach skill provide support necessary enable participant adopt low calorie diet ( e.g. , 1500-2000 kcals per day base start weight ) moderate physical activity ( e.g. , walk ) produce energy deficit necessary produce modest weight loss 1-2 lb per week . Based finding focus group review study design expectation fund source conduct pilot research lead future fund publishable finding , main intervention finalize ( since initial IRB submission ) . The intervention consist randomization either Large Group + Internet Small Group + Internet intervention . The main difference two study group size monthly group session . The internet program deliver monthly group session identical . Group session occur Nutrition Research Institute ( NRI ) monthly basis month 1 - 4 . The internet program use group session . The monthly session begin individual , private , weigh-in , follow group session . One treatment arm large group session interactive feature audience participation . The large group comprise approx . 125 participant , last approximately 1 hour , facilitate weight loss expert ( dietitian , psychologist , exercise physiologist ) . The treatment arm small group session consist approx . 25 participant follow traditional behavioral weight control group session protocol facilitation named-experts . Participants encourage enroll study two friend family member support partner also meet eligibility criterion . Support partner randomize treatment arm . The F2F session couple comprehensive Internet program test previously Tate et al provide self-monitoring tool , tailor automated behavioral feedback , tailor lifestyle content ( lesson ) resource , social support ( e.g . online message board ) participant encourage use monthly session .</detailed_description>
