	<detailed_description>Purpose Study System level strategy implement tobacco use treatment guideline exist insufficiently put practice , particularly dental care setting . Closing gap research practice stymie limited research system change necessary implement tobacco treatment routine dental care . Drawing burgeon dissemination science literature , propose study compare cumulative benefit follow three systems-level strategy : 1 ) staff train clinical reminder , 2 ) provider feedback 3 ) pay-for- performance ( financial incentive ) , widely endorsed 2001 Institute Medicine Report , `` Crossing Quality Chasm '' ( IOM 2011 ) 2008 PHS Guidelines ( Fiore 2007 , Fiore 2008 , IOM 2011 ) . Staff Training Clinical Reminder Systems . The PHS Guideline strongly recommend staff training , clinical reminder system practice support foundation treat tobacco dependence health care setting . Despite observed limitation ( Curry 2008 , Grimshaw 2003 , Shelley 2010 ) , staff training , practice support , clinical reminder system referral pathway represent current best practice ( CBP ) screen treat tobacco dependence . Performance Feedback ( PF ) . In recent randomized trial conduct primary medical care setting , clinical audit feedback regard tobacco treatment performance associate twofold increase cessation assistance referral cessation quitlines ( Bentz 2007 , Curry 2008 , Wadland 2007 ) . While clinical audit feedback show increase provider adherence tobacco use treatment guideline medical setting , strategy yet examine dental practice ( Curry 2000 , Curry 2008 , Fiore 2007 , Fiore 2008 , Grimshaw 2006 , Solberg 2000 ) . Pay Performance ( P4P ) . P4P provide financial incentive meeting predetermine performance goal attract much interest strategy improve guideline implementation quality care ( Petersen 2006 , Sonnad , 1998 ) . The recent consensus report 2nd European Workshop Tobacco use Prevention Cessation Oral Health Professionals emphasize importance appropriate compensation tobacco use treatment provide incentive oral health provider ( Ramseier 2010 ) . Several study demonstrate positive association P4P adherence recommend tobacco use treatment ( An 2008 , Coleman , 2010 , Roski , 2003 ) . For instance , An et al , find P4P program increase referral statewide tobacco quitline service ( An 2008 ) . Electronic dental record automate bill system ( Dentrix system use participate dental clinic site ) add nicotine dependence diagnostic treatment procedure cod . This health informatics trend bode well sustainability performance feedback P4P implementation strategy . Background Based meta-analyses 8000 tobacco cessation study publish past three decade , 2008 Public Health Service ( PHS ) Guideline , Treating Tobacco Use Dependence provide strong evidence provider delivery tobacco dependence treatment , include cessation pharmacotherapy brief counseling , produce significant sustain reduction tobacco use deliver smoker seek routine health care ( Fiore 2008 ) . Provider adherence PHS Guideline recommendation require Asking patient tobacco use , Advising smoker quit , Assessing readiness quit , provide cessation Assistance Arranging follow-up ( 5As ) ( Fiore 2008 ) . Adequate implementation PHS Guidelines would generate 1.6 million additional quitter per year nearly 3.3 million quality life year save ( USDHHS 2000 ) . Despite existence effective tobacco dependence treatment , inadequate adoption , particularly among low income ethnic/racial minority smoker , contribute grow disparity smoke prevalence tobacco-related illness ( Fagan , 2007 , King 2010 , Lopez-Quintero 2006 ) . For instance , Hispanics 57 % African-Americans 13 % le likely receive physician advice quit non-Hispanic white ( Lopez-Quintero 2006 ) . Citing persistent missed opportunity promote tobacco cessation , Institute Medicine 's ( IOM ) report , `` Ending Tobacco Problem : A Blueprint Nation '' , call great effort implement effective tobacco cessation intervention health care setting . The USDHHS Task Force Tobacco Control recently highlight need well understand provider incentive system-level strategy motivate provider adherence PHS guideline leverage emerge opportunity reimbursement preventive service present 2010 Affordable Care Act . These recent health policy report highlight need potential public health value reduce tobacco-related disparity dissemination evidence-based intervention health care delivery system serve low income high-risk smoker ( Medicine . lo 2007 , Services US Department Health Human Services 2010 ) . Dental care setting several advantageous feature delivery tobacco cessation treatment include : 1 ) broad reach 62.8 % 18-64 year old report least one annual dental visit ( Manski 2007 ) , 2 ) access patient receive healthcare service ( 10 % dental patient regularly see physician ) ( Strauss 2006 ) , 3 ) dental team routinely provide preventive service ; 4 ) control trial demonstrate efficacy dental office-based cessation intervention ( Gordon 2006 ) . Moreover , dental professional credible role provide tobacco cessation treatment view oral hazard tobacco use . A recent national survey find 88.7 % dentists 96 % dental hygienist report treat tobacco use important professional responsibility ( Tong 2010 ) . Although dentist still work private practice setting , 475 federally-funded , community neighborhood health center dental clinic another 250 community dental clinic throughout United States ( Gordon 2005 ) . These community dental health center serve predominantly low income population know high prevalence smoking ( Gordon 2010 ) . Therefore , potential impact implement Tobacco Guidelines public health dental clinic substantial ( Gordon 2006 ) . Unfortunately , delivery tobacco use treatment routine dental care remain limited ( Albert 2002 , Albert 2005 , Tong 2010 ) . Although national survey indicate dental provider increasingly screen tobacco use offering brief advice , adherence PHS guideline inconsistent 10-25 % dental health professional ' routinely deliver cessation assistance ( e.g . cessation pharmacotherapy prescription and/or referral cessation counsel ) ( Albert 2002 , Tong 2010 ) . Dentists often cite lack training , adequate reimbursement explain subpar performance provide tobacco cessation intervention ( Albert 2005 ) . Challenges wide-scale implementation tobacco dependence treatment also include lack referral resource lack office-based system ( Gordon 2006 , Albert 2005 ) . PHS guideline implementation likely affect provider attitude organizational priority impact provider behavior ( Albert 2002 , Curry 2000 , Fiore 2008 ) . Study Design We propose 3-arm cluster randomize control trial analyze implementation process compare cost effectiveness three implementation strategy : 1 ) Staff train CBP implement PHS Guidelines ; 2 ) CBP + provider performance feedback ( PF ) 3 ) CBP + PF + Pay-for-performance ( provider reimbursement tobacco cessation treatment delivery ) . Guided Organizational Change Theory Theory Planned Behavior ( Ajzen 1991 , Damschroder 2009 , Greenhalgh 2004 , Solberg 2007 ) identify multi-level factor facilitate impede implementation process dental clinic . Our primary outcome improvement provider delivery tobacco cessation treatment find extensive meta-analysis ( Fiore 2008 ) essential determinant patient cessation outcomes . Our secondary outcome post-intervention patient-reported quit rate . In addition examine comparative effectiveness three implementation strategy , use mixed method approach examine implementation process ( Aim 2 ) ass degree intervention integrate practice intend clarify mechanism intervention influence provider behavior . Clinic level selection performance site guide desire ensure finding would generalizable real-world dental health care setting serve diverse population smoker . We partner 18 public health dental clinic express willingness participate . For practical ( cost staffing ) reason , recruit clinic six successive wave three site enrol per wave ( see Timeline ) . Clinic randomization conduct Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Clinical Research Database Program ( CRDB ) within Biostatistics Service use random permute block method .</detailed_description>
