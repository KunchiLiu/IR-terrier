	<brief_summary>Chronic allograft injury lead cause graft loss renal transplantation . The shortage available kidney transplantation reach crisis level increase number wait list mortality . Strategies prolong graft survival urgently need . The pediatric young adult transplant population one repeat transplantation inevitable therefore , group one especially benefit intervention prolong graft survival . The hypothesis proposal subclinical viral infection modifiable risk factor pathogenesis chronic allograft injury . The young age propose study population ideal one evaluate objective due high prevalence seronegative recipient . The study outline determine temporal relationship betWeween subclinical viremia , renal allograft infection allograft injury . This first prospective study renal transplant recipient systematically monitor subclinical viral infection peripheral blood renal allograft concurrent quantitative measure renal function , allograft fibrosis , innate immune activation . The investigator choose 3 outcome evaluate spectrum renal allograft injury represent different stage - early late - pathophysiology lead renal allograft dysfunction . In addition , role virus specific T cell immune response control subclinical viral infection associate allograft injury determine . These data critical provide insight pathogenesis injury guide development intervention strategy . Importantly , current treatment strategy viral disease prevent subclinical viral infection . Thus , result study may identify prevention , prophylaxis and/or treatment subclinical viral replication long term strategy prevent chronic allograft injury prolong graft survival .</brief_summary>
