	<brief_title>A Study Explore Pharmacokinetics Rilpivirine With Rifabutin Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label ( participant know identity treatment receive ) , 3-period study investigate pharmacokinetic ( body medication ) interaction steady-state ( constant concentration blood result fix dose regimen ) rilpivirine steady-state rifabutin . Twenty healthy participant enrol receive 3 different treatment ( treatment A : rilpivirine 25 mg daily administer daily 11 day ; treatment B : rilpivirine 50 mg daily administer 11 day + rifabutin 300 mg daily administer 17 day ; treatment C : rilpivirine ( regimen determine base interim analysis treatments A B ) administer 11 day + rifabutin 300 mg daily administer 17 day ) . All 20 participant randomize ( study drug assign chance ) receive treatment A ( 10 participant ) treatment B ( 10 participant ) washout period least 21 day treatments A B . After participant complete treatment A B , interim analysis decide upon dose regimen rilpivirine treatment C ( rilpivirine regimen treatment C could either daily twice daily total daily dose rilpivirine 25 75 mg ) . All 20 participant receive treatment C. Safety tolerability evaluate throughout study .</detailed_description>
