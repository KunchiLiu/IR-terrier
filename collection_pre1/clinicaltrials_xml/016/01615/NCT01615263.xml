	<detailed_description>Background : Lung isolation frequently use thoracic surgery . Two technique principally use : double lumen tube ( DLT ) bronchial blocker ( BB ) . Today , thoracic surgical technique perspective video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery ( VATS ) , require effective lung isolation technique The DLT one widely use vast majority anesthesiologist . It introduce eighty actual version polyvinyl chloride . Its position fibrobronchoscope ( FOB ) well establish . Its efficiency reproducible use without major complication . Its use limited presence difficult airway . The BB appear modern form end 1990 . It easy use reputation darken need multiple reposition surgery especially slow lung collapse DLT . The collapse isolate lung result denitrogenation atelectasis drain isolated lung inner channel BB . The diameter length internal channel vary depend model . The BB inner channel much small ( Cook 's Arndt : 1.3 mm ; Cook 's Cohen : 1.6 mm Fuji 's Uniblocker : 2.0 mm ) lumen DLT , vary 6 9 mm ( 35 41 Fr tube ) . A comparative study publish 2003 Campos demonstrate result favor inner channel drain hypothesis . Authors show lung collapse Arndt BB long Uniblocker BB BronchoCath DLT need suction inner channel ( p &gt; 0.06 ) . The limitation report number thoracotomy video-assisted thoracoscopies surgery ( VATS ) mention . Furthermore , side surgery specify . This point important since inflated cuff BB locate right main bronchus may obstruct origin right upper lobe , consequently impair collapse . In 2009 , series 45 thoracotomy 22 VATS , Narayanaswamy Slinger demonstrate lung isolation one lung ventilation ( OLV ) start early , mean immediately post-induction intubation dorsal decubitus position , continuously maintain pleural open . Similar surgical exposure 10 20 minute post pleural opening obtain three modern BB leave DLT . In report , duration lung isolation period one lung ventilation specify . We presume length 20 30 minute pleural opening , create lung collapse denitrogenation , show later publication research team . An early -20 cmH2O suction ( start OLV ) either DLT Cohen 's BB improve lung collapse quality compare late application ( 20 min pleural opening ) . This advantage demonstrate Arndt BB Fuji 's . Another limitation study do leave unilateral surgery avoid inflate BB cuff right main bronchus . This choice create important selection bias since result apply universal use BB . In 2009 , Ko Slinger also publish follow : use fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) 1.0 ( denitrogenation ) ventilate initiation OLV DLT give well surgical exposure 10 20 minute compare FiO2 0.4 . These result 4 VATS 100 thoracotomy . Early initiation OLV dorsal decubitus recommend author follow reason : additional OLV period 15 30 minute beneficial patient desaturation occur . Moreover , mobilization patient lateral decubitus could lead complication relate inflated BB . In fact , proximal movement BB 's cuff completely obstruct trachea . There also risk trauma airway . Note risk theoretical since note describe context . Since recommend proceed lung isolation patient position lateral decubitus , surprising complication report literature . Reading recent literature subject accord vast experience numerous hospital center , seem slowness lung collapse remain without solution . This slowness lung deflation detrimental initiation VATS could exacerbate COPD patient . For reason , BB use discredit numerous center . However , IUCPQ , investigator rarely observe slow lung collapse BB use . For many year , investigator use systematic denitrogenation lung initiation OLV . Furthermore , patient position lateral decubitus , investigator impose apnea period 30 second favor collapse isolate lung inflate cuff . This apnea always limit occurrence O2 desaturation ( ≤97 % ) . The investigator also proceed second period apnea 30 second associate deflate BB 's cuff pleural opening . Subsequently , investigator inflate BB 's cuff obtain definitive lung isolation . Actual literature allow anesthesiologist conclude clearly choice bronchial blocker . Thus , investigator propose study add essential data make good choice lung isolation device . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesis use two apnea period , isolate lung BB , allow quality surgical exposure 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 minute post open pleura compare one obtain DLT . The investigator use Fuji 's BB occlude internal channel able extrapolate investigator result BB actually market .</detailed_description>
