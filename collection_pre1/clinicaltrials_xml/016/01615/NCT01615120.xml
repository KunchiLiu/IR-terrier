A serum PSA response undetectable level serum PSA ( ≤ 0.2/mL ) least 90 % reduction serum PSA serum PSA value prior initiation treatment &lt; 10ng/mL Have rise serum PSA two successive assessment least 2 week apart serum PSA level ≥ 2ng/mL &gt; 2 ng/mL 25 % increase nadir ADT . Be continue ADT throughout study give write informed consent prior study specific procedure subject must agree , already anticoagulation therapy aspirin , take 81 mg aspirin daily throughout duration participation study 30 day completion dose GTx758 . Subjects must agree use acceptable method contraception : If female partner pregnant lactating , acceptable method contraception time first administration study medication 3 month follow administration last dose study medication must use . Acceptable method : condom use spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . If subject undergone surgical sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azospermia ) , condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository use . If male subject 's partner could become pregnant , use acceptable method contraception time first administration study medication 3 month follow administration last dose study medication.Acceptable method contraception follow : condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository [ i.e. , barrier method contraception ] , surgical sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azospermia ) barrier method { condom use spermicidal foam/gel/fil/cream/suppository } , female partner use oral contraceptive ( combination estrogen/progesterone pills ) , injectable progesterone subdermal implant barrier method { condom use spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository } . If female partner undergone document tubal ligation ( female sterilization ) , barrier method { condom use spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository } use If female partner undergone document placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) , barrier method { condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository } also use . Known hypersensitivity allergy estrogen estrogen like drug Need urgent chemotherapy , radiation therapy surgical intervention prostate cancer opinion investigator ; Any disease condition ( medical surgical ) might compromise hematologic , cardiovascular , endocrine , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , central nervous system ; condition may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion study drug , would place subject increase risk Subjects personal history abnormal blood clot thrombotic disease ( venous arterial thrombotic event history stroke , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolus ( PE ) ) . Any subject , determine central laboratory , 1. modify activate protein C reaction ratio ≤ 2.5 Factor V Leiden gene mutation , 2. antithrombin level lower limit normal range , 3. antiphospholipid antibody level indeterminate , positive , outside normal range , 4. prothrombin gene mutation Symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , history atrial fibrillation The presence consistently abnormal laboratory value consider clinically significant . In addition , subject liver enzyme ( ALT AST ) 2 time upper limit normal , total bilirubin 2 time upper limit normal , serum creatinine 1.5 time upper limit normal NOT admit study . Received investigational drug within period 90 day prior enrollment study . Received study medication GTx758 previously ; Currently take testosterone , testosterone like agent , 5areductase inhibitor ( finasteride , dutasteride ) , antiandrogens ( bicalutamide , flutamide nilutamide ) . Subjects take 5areductase inhibitor one antiandrogens may eligible subject undergoes 6 week washout period stop therapy . The subject must least two rise serum PSA level least 2 week apart therapy 5areductase inhibitor antiandrogens stop ( antiandrogen withdrawal ) complete 6week washout period eligible ; Have previously take currently take diethylstilbestrol , estrogens , abiraterone ketoconazole inhibitor CYP17 ( 17ahydroxylase/C17,20lyase ) ; Currently radiation therapy prostate cancer control ( radiation bone relieve pain acceptable ) Have previously take currently take enzalutamide ; Have previously receive cytotoxic chemotherapy prostate cancer ; Recent hospitalization ( within 30 day screen ) ; Recent surgery ( within 30 day screen ) ; Have take body build fertility supplement within 4 week admission study ; Have previously diagnose treated active cancer ( prostate cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within previous five year ; Have BMI &gt; 35 .</criteria>
