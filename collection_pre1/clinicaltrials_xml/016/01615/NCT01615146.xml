	<brief_summary>As result underlie disease therapy , common patient blood cancer low platelet count . While platelet transfusion may beneficial prevent treat bleeding symptom , circumstance risk bleed low may unnecessary even harmful . As blood product , transfusion platelet may associate infectious allergic complication , frequent hospital visit transfusion may adversely affect quality life . Additionally , potentially overuse platelet product place burden health care resource . The benefit current practice prophylactic platelet transfusion prevent hemorrhage unknown . The randomized data exist 25 year old informative give methodological limitation change standard supportive care . An alternative , therapeutic , strategy involve administer platelet control active bleeding . The standard practice inpatient receive high dose chemotherapy ( either acute leukemia part stem cell transplantation ) prophylactic platelet transfusion . In outpatient receive high dose chemotherapy , risk bleed significantly low . No randomized trial examine optimal platelet transfusion strategy outpatient blood cancer undergo supportive palliative therapy . Thus potential benefit prophylactic transfusion outpatient set unknown . The investigator propose perform pilot randomize control trial determine large trial possible . The ultimate goal determine strategy therapeutic platelet transfusion safe effective outpatient blood cancer low platelet count .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization : A local study nurse use web-based randomization system ( permuted random block two four patient ) allocate consent patient . Medical research staff investigator blind randomization scheme . Study Duration Follow-up : All patient assign either therapeutic prophylactic platelet transfusion 6-month period . This period time allow u assess primary feasibility outcomes enrollment , compliance transfusion protocol , completion bleeding evaluation quality life questionnaires patient . Patients group CBC measure least weekly study . More frequent monitoring platelet count may perform discretion treat physician . The research team clinically assess patient within 1 week ( +/- 3 day ) randomization , monthly thereafter . Patients ask report non-cutaneous grade 2 great bleed immediately treat physician study team . All self-assessments bleed review patient visit ensure clinically relevant bleed episode capture . Patients whose platelet count recovers great 20 x 109/L least six week take weekly platelet count monitoring reflect clinical practice . They continue monitor duration study . If platelet count fall 10 x 109/L restart monitoring previous transfusion protocol . Data Collection : Baseline Data - The following clinical laboratory data collect time enrolment : ( 1 ) demographic data , ( 2 ) diagnosis include date disease stage , ( 3 ) prior chemotherapy , ( 4 ) ECOG performance status , ( 5 ) comorbidites , ( 6 ) previous platelet red cell transfusion , ( 7 ) red cell transfusion history , ( 8 ) prior bleed event , ( 9 ) quality life ( EQ5D ) ( 10 ) routine bloodwork Transfusions : All platelet red cell transfusion record include date number unit . For platelet transfusion , type platelet product ( e.g . apheresis buffy coat ) ABO compatibility record . Additionally , indication transfusion ( prophylactic treat bleed ) obtain attend physician . Bleeding Assessment : Participants ask complete simple bleeding questionnaire daily basis previously test used outpatient thrombocytopenia . Patients receive short training session write material complete form . A bleeding assessment perform study follow-up visit ( interview , physical exam review daily bleed form ) . Bleeding event assign bleed grade study personnel . A final bleeding grade assign adjudication panel 2 blind physician independently assign bleed score . Any discrepancy bleed score resolve consensus . Quality Life : Quality life measure use EQ-5D . The EQ-5D validate tool measurement health-related quality life precedent use transfusion medicine trial . Quality life assessment perform baseline subsequent patient visit .</detailed_description>
