	<detailed_description>1 . The Need Trial What problem address ? Respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) major clinical challenge affect 60 % baby bear 30 week gestation significantly contribute mortality morbidity preterm infant , include chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia . Given immature lung tiny infant developmentally deficient surfactant , exogenous surfactant administration might beneficial prevent pulmonary atelectasis . The traditional method preterm infant via endotracheal tube accompany mechanical ventilation use positive pressure . The latter predisposes permanent lung injury.This study seek assess feasibility conduct large-scale clinical trial compare two minimally invasive method surfactant administration low birth weight preterm infant . As comparative study report , propose study pilot trial test feasibility study design gather preliminary data comparison two method surfactant administration . Results study inform design large clinical trial include appropriate power calculation . Current management lung disease preterm infant RDS significantly contribute mortality morbidity preterm infant , , major determinant chronic lung disease ( CLD ) premature infant . One common cause RDS surfactant deficiency ; therefore , exogenous surfactant frequently use treatment RDS preterm infant . Endogenous surfactant typically produce alveolar cell type II substance , among function , decrease modulates surface tension small gas exchange unit lung , alveoli.1 It show surfactant treatment effective use within first hour life rather later rescue therapy . The traditional method surfactant administration via endotracheal tube infant intubate mechanically ventilate , latter often result pulmonary inflammatory response . This response know significant contributor development CLD main pulmonary morbidity , short long term , associate premature birth , thus traditionally support need mechanical ventilation highly vulnerable phase lung development . Despite advance management respiratory distress , 30 % infant bear &lt; 1,000 g still develop CLD - define oxygen need 36 week postmenstrual age . Some infant develop severe lung disease require ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen month year . Significant contributor adverse long term outcome premature birth oxidant - ventilation mediate injury inflammation , lead disrupt alveolarization septation lung . One well establish therapy prevent RDS antenatal administration steroid mother imminent preterm birth induction lung maturation , treatment result significant improve outcome follow preterm birth . This treatment result improve neonatal lung compliance few infant require exogenous surfactant therapy.7 The increase use intervention lead infant necessarily require postnatal surfactant thus reduce need mechanical ventilation , allow manage even extreme low birth weight infant non-invasive pressure support CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) establish functional residual capacity . Postnatal non-invasive respiratory support use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) show effective reduce lung damage several study , especially initiated immediate postnatal adaptation period . This result few day ventilation trend towards low risk CLD , compare intubate mechanically ventilated control . However , number infant start CPAP ultimately require intubation administration exogenous surfactant within first 72 hour remain high extremely low birth weight category . Usually CPAP failure due unremitting RDS require surfactant therapy . There evidence fail CPAP therapy , define need intubation within 72 hour postnatal age , associated adverse outcome infant 25 28 week gestation high risk CLD , death CLD necrotizing enterocolitis . In trial infant 29 32 week gestation fail CPAP high risk pneumothorax . In current clinical practice neonatologists face quandary avoid mechanical positive pressure ventilation , knowledge surfactant treatment effective early phase RDS , CPAP failure could lead high risk adverse outcome . Hence effort make develop non-invasive strategy surfactant application take advantage high efficacy treatment decrease duration mechanical ventilation subsequent lung injury . To date , attempt produce effective surfactant nebulization unsuccessful . Recent advance treatment RDS In 1999 , Swedish group develop InSurE procedure surfactant administration , involve intubation solely purpose surfactant administration follow immediate extubation CPAP , thereby avoid prolonged positive pressure ventilation . A Cochrane systematic review 2008 conclude method , compare later selective surfactant therapy continue mechanical ventilation , associate less need mechanical ventilation , low incidence CLD few air leak syndrome . InSurE show effective even use multiple time patient . Failure InSurE associate severity RDS extremely low birth weight &lt; 750g . The CURPAP trial compare prophylactic administration surfactant use INSURE technique early CPAP early selective surfactant therapy require . This trial find difference outcome mechanical ventilation first 5 day life . Minimally invasive surfactant application ( MISurf ) via feed tube IV cannula device recently describe innovative method surfactant administration without need positive pressure ventilation . Using technique visualization larynx direct laryngoscopy classical intubation , respective device position infant 's trachea , surfactant apply , device remove immediately without mechanical ventilation ; If already CPAP , patient place nasal CPAP immediately follow procedure . In large open-label multi- center randomize controlled trial , method significantly reduce need mechanical ventilation preterm infant 26 28 week gestation . What is/are principal research question ( ) address ? This pilot study seek assess feasibility conduct large-scale randomized trial compare two describe method deliver surfactant , MISURF INSURE . If study design prove feasible , large trial would test hypothesis early surfactant administration via feed tube/ IV cannula device complete avoidance mechanical ventilation compare INSURE decrease incidence duration invasive ventilation whole study population decrease incidence CLD infant 25-28 week gestation . Why trial need ? Evidence show classical , invasive way administer surfactant therapy associate serious side effect . This method currently commonly use neonatology , include McMaster . MISurf InSurE common minimally invasive surfactant application technique use neonatology ; InSurE consider best practice minimally invasive application MISurf promising practice . They compare either CPAP therapy classical way administer surfactant evidence benefit . No systematic review exist randomized trial use minimally invasive surfactant delivery . Our literature review search term surfactant therapy , minimal invasive surfactant application , InSurE , comparison , preterm infant , non invasive surfactant application , different combination , reveal one trial compare two method directly . The combination minimally invasive surfactant application without mechanical ventilation early CPAP therapy offer best lung protective strategy . A theoretical counter-argument could administer surfactant without pressure ventilation ( MISurf ) , distribution surfactant lung tissue could less efficient compare ( INSurE ) intubation surfactant administration accompany positive pressure ventilation . Hence comparative randomize trial significantly contribute evidence knowledge role two minimal invasive strategy surfactant administration influence respectively change practice Hamilton Health Sciences beyond . The outcome trial could support rationale multicenter trial throughout Canada . Why pilot study necessary ? As first study compare two method , aspect feasibility test . The design propose pilot study randomize , two arm intervention trial , mask intervention . It vital investigate procedure trial mask intervention feasible . Recruitment rate , drop-out rate meeting exclusion criterion , refusal rate , consent- randomization process , acceptance clinician staff , also need investigate . The result pilot trial inform sample size calculation large trial . This pilot also confirm acceptability study inclusion criterion . Clinical relevance As described , CPAP therapy alone might lead unfavorable outcome group patient use intubation fail treatment need rescue surfactant therapy . However , undertake surfactant therapy extreme premature infant consider good clinical practice . What need able identify patient group likely benefit surfactant therapy , define optimal time method surfactant application . This lead well outcome due less day ventilatory treatment , translate significant decrease cost short term ( one surfactant application cost 300 &gt; 1000 $ , depend product country ) well long term , consider burden cost CLD , child need specialist care first year life . 2 . The Proposed Trial Study Design We propose assess feasibility mask , prospective randomize controlled trial , two intervention arm , compare surfactant application use InSurE technique versus MISurf technique . As early CPAP therapy currently standard care patient less 33 week gestation , patient arm study receive intervention . What plan trial intervention ? 1 . MISurf : Minimally invasive intratracheal surfactant application without mechanical ventilation feed tube device 2 . InSurE : Surfactant application InSurE strategy ( Intubation - surfactant - extubation sequence ) . Both intervention perform intervention team , comprise attend physician , neonatal fellow , respiratory therapist , nurse practitioner nurse . The physical visualization application surfactant perform attend physician neonatal fellow , part intervention team . For MISurf intervention , decide use minimally invasive method via feed tube exclusively due concern possibility airway injury iv cannula device . Surfactant Two porcine derive surfactant product use publish trial minimal invasive surfactant application , Curosurf© Survanta© . Due safety reason use product also pilot study however , latter currently available Canada . Hence use Survanta© 100 mg/kgBW , equivalent 4 ml/kgBW per dose . Medication Considering non invasiveness procedure , medication ( anaesthetic agent , analgosedation ) administer study intervention . What propose practical arrangement allocate participant trial group ? This pilot trial allocate participant group use simple randomization seal nontransparent envelope . Every eligible patient parental consent obtain randomized birth . What propose method protect source bias ?

Primary clinical outcome Failure rate intervention , failure define : - Need invasive ventilation , require either FiO2 0.6 pCO2 65 mm Hg pH &lt; 7.20 2 hour surfactant administration 72 hrs life - Intubation/requirement mechanical ventilation within 48h first intervention ( criterion ) - For InSurE : Failed extubation within 15 min intubation surfactant application - SAE immediate intervention lead intubation ( e.g . severe bradycardia/resuscitation , pneumothorax ) 6 . Secondary clinical outcome - Proportion infant require intervention - Proportion follow co-morbidities discharge ? - Incidence grade 3 4 IVH ( intraventricular hemorrhage ) , - PVL ( periventricular leucomalacia ) , - ROP ( retinopathy prematurity ) require treatment , - NEC ( necrotizing enterocolitis ) stage 2 3 - Total duration invasive non-invasive ventilation ( extubation criterion follow extubation- weaning guideline ) , duration oxygen supplementation discharge - Proportion patient require oxygen supplementation discharge - Proportion surfactant related adverse event like tube blockade , episodes desaturation , bradycardia , pulmonary hemorrhage , pneumothorax differ two group - Total number surfactant dos require compare two group - Incidence CLD . CLD assess per physiological CLD definition severity score mild , moderate severe - Death How outcome measure measure follow ? Clinical outcome data collect patient medical record research coordinator verify principal investigator . Feasibility outcome data document intervention team collect research coordinator . What criteria success pilot study ? We aim verify possible perform large scale clinical trial study design . Given currently almost 100 % patient treated classical surfactant application , rate &gt; 50 % recruited patient treat accord protocol recruitment consent rate indicate large scale trial estimate sample size 150 200 patient within 2 3 year perform determine success pilot trial . Sample size The sample size primarily determine base feasibility consideration . To test feasibility study design total 40 patient ( , 20 patient arm ) .In general , estimate 200 preterm infant admit McMaster NICU per year 40 % would fulfill eligibility criterion trial . Thus , sufficient number assess feasibility recruitment main trial . Main study : The sample size calculate base result pilot study . What plan recruitment rate ? How recruitment organize ? Over time period recruitment take place ? What evidence plan recruitment rate achievable ? Where possible , recruitment take place antenatally . The research coordinator screen Labour &amp; Delivery high risk patient eligibility . Mothers inform study approach consent , provide consent contact . A recruitment rate 70 % achievable base previous experience clinical study unit population . All infant gestational age &lt; 30 week eligible . Based data McMaster NICU Vermont Oxford Network Canadian Neonatal Network around proportion 40 % patient estimate meet inclusion criterion intervention . What propose type analysis ?

All test perform alpha = 0.05 level significance . We adjust overall level significance multiple test test primarily exploratory . All analysis perform use SAS 9.2 ( Cary . NC ) . What propose frequency analysis ? Interim analysis conduct follow inclusion first 20 patient , expect around 6 month , assumption population 200/year , recruitment rate 70 % eligibility rate enter one intervention arm 40 % . Safety DSMB : Considering patient population intervention DSMB establish . This comprise external trialist/statistician , external neonatologist external experience clinical researcher outside subject area . SAEs : SAEs capture report DSMB within 24h . Alternative treatment : There considerable amount patient ( around 25 % ) require intervention remain CPAP treatment alone.31 The alternative pathway would intubation mechanical ventilation due various cause respiratory failure . Ethical consideration Full approval FHS/HHS REB obtain prior commencement . 7 . Risks safety participant involve trial Although first time intervention compare neither intervention consider technically challenge new . Hence enhance risk compare classical surfactant application expect . The threshold intervention choose accord best practice recommendation similar surfactant trials.14-21,26,28,29 Adverse event relate intervention pneumothorax , tube blockage , pulmonary hemorrhage treat current best practice intensive care complication . They report describe 2.15 . 8 . Informed consent Written inform parental consent obtain research coordinator physician involve intervention team infant immediate care , coordinator available .
