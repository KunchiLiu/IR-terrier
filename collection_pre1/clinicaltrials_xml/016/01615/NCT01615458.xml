	<brief_title>Disseminating Evidence-based Mood Disorder Chronic Care Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic mood disorder ( notably , bipolar disorder recurrent unipolar major depressive disorder ) associate substantial functional impairment , morbidity , economic burden , mortality . Depression bipolar disorder common leading cause disability worldwide , associate substantial cost , leave untreated , lead premature mortality , particularly suicide . Despite proliferation evidence-based guideline treatment mood disorder , quality care subsequent outcomes remain suboptimal suffering illness . Collaborative chronic care model ( CCMs ) demonstrate efficacy cost-effectiveness manage depression recently , bipolar disorder . Many successful intervention improve depression treatment outcome ( e.g. , PROSPECT ) base Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) . These treatment model combine patient self-management education ongoing care coordination deliver care manager , coordinate care primary care mental health provider facilitate systematic dissemination guideline relate mood disorder treatment . In bipolar disorder , CCMs find cost-neutral , depression , cost-effective compare usual care ; hence make business case CCMs promise private public sector . There mount demand CCMs implement patient across different mental health diagnosis , order maximize reach across diverse clinic population , make appeal healthcare provider , might reluctant hire multiple care manager different condition . Unipolar major depressive bipolar disorder common form mood disorder treat specialty mental health well primary care setting . Up 5.5 % 16.2 % population bipolar spectrum disorder unipolar major depressive disorder , respectively . Based pilot data Colorado Access , third patent treat depression routine care setting screen positive bipolar disorder . Moreover , third patient unipolar depression remit , part might attribute under-treatment inappropriate treatment bipolar II disorder . However , CCMs unipolar depression bipolar disorder exist , date implement combination . This project pilot test combine CCM apply patient unipolar depression bipolar disorder specialty mental health primary care clinic . This one-year pilot randomize control trial compare LGCC usual care involve patient diagnose bipolar disorder unipolar depression receive care clinic affiliate NNDC site unaffiliated primary care site . The project implement three phase : training exist staff local Depression Center clinic , implementation LGCC , final outcome evaluation inform future study . Patients four mental health clinic affiliate NNDC site ( University Michigan Depression Center , Stanford University Depression Center , University Colorado-Denver Depression Center , University California-San Francisco Depression Center ) 1 primary care set ( Packard Community Health , Ann Arbor , MI ) randomize receive LGCC standard care usual ( 32 per site ; total 160 patient ) . Randomization stratify diagnosis ( unipolar depression bipolar disorder ) . At end pilot study , patient randomize receive LGCC offer intervention . An additional 10 provider ask complete survey site ( total n=50 ) , grand total n=210 participant ( 160 patient 50 provider ) .</detailed_description>
