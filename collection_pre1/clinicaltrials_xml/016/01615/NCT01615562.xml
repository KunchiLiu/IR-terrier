	<detailed_description>Overview : Although adult woman PCOS demonstrate evidence endothelial dysfunction , little known regard alteration number pro-inflammatory monocyte , CEC , CPC , ECFC ( endothelial injury/repair profile ) among affected woman . For many woman , clinical manifestation PCOS emerge adolescence . Based study document increase prevalence MetS inflammatory marker adolescent girl PCOS , non-invasive study document presence endothelial dysfunction child traditional cardiovascular risk factor , likely adolescent girl PCOS already manifest evidence early vascular dysfunction , may turn impair follicular development contribute development infertility . Consequently , hypothesize perturbation balance circulate inflammatory progenitor cell contribute endothelial dysfunction observe adult woman PCOS . Specifically , anticipate PCOS woman manifest great evidence vascular injury ( increased number inflammatory monocyte , CEC , ECFC ) impair endothelial repair ( decreased level CPC ) compare control woman . Moreover , propose , adolescent girl PCOS , endothelial dysfunction correspond alteration endothelial injury/repair profile already present . Specific Aim 1 : Determine endothelial injury/repair profile ( inflammatory monocyte , CEC , CPC , ECFC ) assess flow cytometry ( PFC ) endothelial function ( assessed flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery ) alter treatment-naïve adult ( 18-40 year age ) woman PCOS ( n=15 ) compare age body mass index ( BMI ) -matched control woman ( n=15 ) . Specific Aim 2 : Determine endothelial injury/repair profile assess PFC , AGE level , endothelial function ( assessed FMD brachial artery ) alter treatment-naïve adolescent ( 14-17 year age ) PCOS ( n=15 ) compare age BMI-Z-score-matched control girl ( n=15 ) . Specific Aim 3 : Determine observe alteration endothelial injury/repair profile ( pro-inflammatory monocyte , CEC , CPC ECFC ) level AGE correlate endothelial function ( assessed FMD brachial artery ) adolescent adult woman ( n=30 ) without PCOS ( n=30 ) , whether androgen , insulin resistance , cardiovascular risk factor influence relationship . This cross-sectional study design involve 30 post-menarchal adolescent 30 adult female subject . Specifically , adolescent population include 15 treatment-naïve adolescent female ( age 14-17 year ) PCOS 15 age- BMI-percentile-matched control adolescent subject . Similarly , adult study population include 15 treatment-naïve adult female ( age 18-40 year ) PCOS 15 age- BMI-matched control woman . All study procedure conduct Clinical Research Services Unit ( CRSU ) Virginia Commonwealth University ( VCU ) single visit ( ~3.5 hr ) . CRSU Visit : Subjects admit CRSU 12-hour overnight fast . Subjects also instruct refrain vigorous physical activity 24 hour prior visit . All participant undergo detailed medical history ( include menstrual history ) complete physical examination ( include assessment Tanner Staging breast pubic hair development ) . Hirsutism assess use modify Ferriman-Gallwey score system . At study visit , follow anthropometric measurement perform subject : - Blood pressure obtain leave arm - 3 reading 5 minute interval - Pulse - Temperature - Height ( 2 measurement ) - Weight ( 2 measurement ) - Waist/umbilicus/hip circumference measurement ( 2 measurement ) - Bioimpedence At study visit rest electrocardiogram ( ECG ) obtain subject . At study visit , follow lab obtain subject : - Comprehensive metabolic panel - Lipid panel - Urine pregnancy - TSH* - Prolactin* - 17-hydroxyprogesterone* - Testosterone* *These analysis perform additional eligibility screening need PI request . All subject undergo measurement brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) . FMD test perform PI Co-Investigator CRSU Peripheral Vascular Lab assistance train technician use ultrasound peripheral vascular imaging system . Adult subject also undergo brachial artery reactivity test assessment non-endothelial dependent ( NED ) vessel dilation follow administration nitroglycerin . NED test perform follow rest period least 15 minute completion FMD testing . 400 μg nitroglycerin administer sublingually , image record least 3 minute follow administration nitroglycerin . Following FMD test ( allow 30 minute interval ) , subject undergo 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test . • Samples collect baseline ( -15 0 ) 30 minute interval glucose , insulin</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PCOS define NIH/NICHD criterion : 1 ) oligo amenorrhea ( ≤8 menstrual period annually , persist 2 year post menarche ) ; 2 ) biochemical hyperandrogenism ( HA ) , i.e. , elevate total free testosterone concentration and/or clinical evidence HA ( define presence hirsutism ) ; 3 ) exclusion secondary cause ovulatory dysfunction HA ( include hyperprolactinemia , thyroid dysfunction , nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( NCAH ) due 21hydroxylase deficiency , Cushing syndrome , androgen secrete neoplasm , androgenic/anabolic drug use ) . Inclusion criterion adolescent adult control subject include 1 ) normal menstrual period ( define regular cycle 2236 day length ) ; 2 ) normal serum androgen ( total/free testosterone dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate [ DHEAS ] ) ; 3 ) absence clinical evidence hyperandrogenism . Additionally , adolescent control must 2 year post menarche .
