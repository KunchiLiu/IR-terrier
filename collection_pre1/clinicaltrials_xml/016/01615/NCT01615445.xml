	<brief_summary>Previous animal study find resveratrol supplementation significantly increase aerobic capacity . The investigator conduct randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study ass whether resveratrol could provide similar benefit human . All participant assign two 4-week treatment period , 2 week washout in-between . During one period , volunteer receive resveratrol period , receive identical-appearing placebo . The primary outcome interest change exercise capacity , measure change exercise duration constant load exercise test change aerobic capacity ( peak VO2 ) incremental exercise testing . Secondary outcome tolerability side-effects associate resveratrol .</brief_summary>
