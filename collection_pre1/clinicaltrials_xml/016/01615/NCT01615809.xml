	<brief_title>Nebulized Amphotericin B Lipid Complex Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis Paediatric Patients With Acute Leukaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year incidence invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) especially cause filamentous fungi increase patient haematological malignancy exist international consensus diagnostic criterion . Despite diagnostic therapeutic progress , invasive aspergillosis remain major clinical problem haematological patient , give still high mortality rate huge economic cost hospitalization patient , attributable aspergillosis . In addition morbidity mortality rate , infection interfere chemotherapy treatment plan risk compromise outcome antileukemic treatment . In uncontrolled study inhale amphotericin B deoxycholate show benefit haematological patient , however effective large multicenter study neutropenic patient . Based outcome clinical trial , use aerosolise amphotericin B deoxycholate neutropenic patient abandon nearly decade . During time use azole agent drug choice antifungal prophylaxis high risk patient consolidate . However , one main problem use triazoles activity filamentous fungi ( itraconazole , voriconazole , posaconazole ) drug-drug interaction due CYP3A4 inhibitory activity . One serious interaction occur vincristine , use throughout treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia , lead report neurotoxicity due metabolic inhibition . ABLC ( Abelcet® ) belong group polyenes antifungal activity broad spectrum fungal specie , include Aspergillus spp . The active component ABELCET® , amphotericin B , act bind sterol cell membrane susceptible fungi , resultant change permeability membrane . Mammalian cell membrane also contain sterol , damage human cell believe occur mechanism action . Abelcet® recommend intravenous treatment broad spectrum systemic fungal infection adult patient . Although pediatric indication , numerous study publish regard safety level Abelcet® administer intravenously child haematological adult patient look promise . In context , work hypothesis propose project administration aerosolise ABLC pediatric patient acute leukemia treat intensive chemotherapy effective alternative prophylaxis pulmonary fungal infection patient . In treatment pediatric patient haematological malignancy use intensive chemotherapy require , immunosuppressive therefore significantly increase risk IFI , especially filamentous fungi . IPA associate high mortality ( &gt; 50 % ) patient , make imperative adopt effective , preventive , prophylactic measure . Drug interaction occur frequently triazole antifungal drug ; case clinically significant interaction vincristine , anchor drug treatment majority pediatric leukemia , document . On hand , promise data previous study regard safety efficacy intravenous ABLC formulation ( Abelcet® ) treatment pediatric patient fungal infection . If working hypothesis confirm , aerosolise ABLC treatment would effective , safe reliable prophylactic option IPA . It would offer alternative systemic administration antifungal triazoles without affect antileukemic treatment pediatric patient AL .</detailed_description>
