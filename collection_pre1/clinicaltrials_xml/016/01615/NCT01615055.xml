	<detailed_description>Systematic study adverse cognitive neurobiological change subsequent chemotherapy lymphoma , breast , cancer attract substantial interest past decade . Little known , however , concern feasibility effect potentially protective therapy cerebral function patient undergoing chemotherapy . Animal model recently prove useful examine toxic effect chemotherapy agent work memory ability , well biological property proliferation survival neuronal precursor involve hippocampal neurogenesis . Such model also prove useful test potential neuroprotective property agent give , and/or chemotherapy . For example , impairment spatial work memory decrease hippocampal neurogenesis induce rat chemotherapy agent methotrexate , co-administration ( FDA-cleared commercially available ) drug fluoxetine show counteract negative long-term effect memory hippocampal neurogenesis otherwise occur methotrexate administration . To determine whether strategy could effective counteract effect chemotherapy may cerebral function human , well-controlled experimental data obtain cancer patient need . This investigation employ prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled design , provide rigorous test whether fluoxetine , drug long-standing excellent safety profile human commonly market antidepressant , offer protection breast cancer lymphoma patient change cerebral function occur chemotherapy ( Specific Aim 1 ) . It provide test durability protective effect beyond period fluoxetine use , re-assessing function approximately 6 month completion regimen ( Specific Aim 2 ) . Cerebral function assess determine distribution regional cerebral metabolism , previously demonstrate sensitively detect functional alteration closely reflect diminished cognitive ability high statistical power , use positron emission tomography glucose analog radiotracer [ F-18 ] fluorodeoxyglucose . Neuropsychologic test conduct parallel neuroimaging study , step towards understand mechanism underlie neurotoxic effect chemotherapy potentially relate protective effect fluoxetine , peripheral marker inflammatory cytokine measure blood sample draw time neuroimaging ( Specific Aim 3 ) . If use fluoxetine cancer patient validate manner lead adoption clinical setting , constitute first drug demonstrate utility prevention cerebral dysfunction associate exposure chemotherapy . Moreover , involve agent already FDA-cleared indication , widely commercially available throughout U.S. part world , relatively inexpensive since obtainable generic formulation , would represent pharmacologic approach amenable rapid translation clinical setting .</detailed_description>
