	<brief_title>Association Between Mother 's Exposure `` Strep Throat '' Her Baby 's Developing Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : 1. measure maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal carriage define positive throat culture absence symptom among Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome ( HLHS ) mother . 2. define incidence positive strep throat culture among asymptomatic pregnant woman , identify &lt; 18 week gestation follow term . 3 . Measure antibody may cross react select valvular/myocardial antigen HLHS/Congenital Heart Defect ( CHD ) -other neonate bear mother study 4. determine serum and/or tissue reactivity antibody match maternal serum . The secondary objective study : 1. measure maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal serology use standard serology test among HLHS mother . 2. determine history maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal exposure use study questionnaire among HLHS mother . 3 . Determine `` baseline '' strep serology history strep exposure among cohort asymptomatic pregnant woman , identify &lt; 18 week gestation follow term . The overall purpose study evaluate history β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal exposure , group A , G C ( `` strep throat '' ) pregnant woman whose pregnancy complicate diagnosis congenital heart disease . Our short-term goal identify potential association antecedent maternal strep throat exposure pregnancy identify subset heart defect 4 . To determine co-infections play role congenital heart defect</detailed_description>
