Regular physical activity perform variety cognitive activity reduce risk dementia improve ability quality life healthy people . Therefore combination activity may reduce risk develop dementia MCI . The investigator want see develop program combine activity fun social way get people active keep active . The aim improve fitness , cognition quality life . The investigator plan use computer internet help activity make available people isolate . Physical activity involve walk home , cognitive activity computer base game puzzle socialise involve regular varied group-based activity . Participants ( 128 ) recruit UCL Derwent Memory Clinic complete 26 week program . They follow yearly monitor progress . The main outcome study engagement activity .
