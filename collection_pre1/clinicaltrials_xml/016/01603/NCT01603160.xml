	<brief_title>Improving Emergency Department Management Adults With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There critical need consistently provide best practice care adult patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) present emergency department ( EDs ) . Patients SCD suffer shorten lifespan , often die many disease associate complication 4th 5th decade life . These complication include , limited : stroke , sepsis , pulmonary embolus , acute chest syndrome , multi-system organ failure . Patients typically present ED severe acute pain require rapid analgesic administration , often high dos opioids . The perception among many clinician patient , usually African American , `` drug seek '' . This result delay administration analgesic inferior pain management . Finally , small proportion adult SCD large number visit . A recent study reveal approximately 25 % adult patient SCD six ED visit per year 10 % 23 visit . Several patient 175 visit 2-year period . There also evidence SCD patient two hospitalizations/year increase risk death . ED clinician often frustrate see patient multiple ED visit . This also lead inadequate analgesic management . These issue highlight suboptimal effectiveness process system ED care adult SCD . ED practice SCD care would significantly benefit re-design implementation innovative best practice management strategy optimize ED evaluation management VOC-related pain facilitate appropriate referral primary care provider . The ED-SCANS validated reliable decision support tool develop principal investigator help guide ED clinician deliver best practice care adult SCD . However , optimal integration tool within ED system process care effect tool ED system patient outcomes evaluate . This study next logical step implementation ED-SCANS . The propose study use four key decision ED-SCANS ( triage , analgesic management , identification high risk patient , patient referral care ) framework improve process system ED management adult SCD . A proactive risk assessment methodology -- Failure Modes , Effects , Criticality Analysis ( FMECA ) -- use two EDs identify vulnerability , risk , weak point ( failure ) system process involved four key decision ED-SCANS . Based aggregated result FMECA 's , generalizable quality improvement intervention ( QII 's ) develop implement purpose change way emergency care adult SCD deliver organize . These re-designed system process ( intervention ) develop generalizable EDs , minor modification . A formal program evaluation conduct determine barrier facilitator implementation intervention . Preliminary , hypothesis generate data collect select outcomes related four decision associate ED-SCANS . A toolbox educational material electronic medical record prompt EDs develop facilitate implementation ED-SCANS EDs across country . This study therefore focus ( 1 ) develop optimal implementation strategy use formal risk assessment ( FMECA ) quality improvement ( PDSA ) method focus four key decision ED-SCANS : Decision 1 : triage , Decision 2 : analgesic management , Decision 3 : identification high risk patient , Decision 7 : patient referral care improve process system involve care adult SCD ( 2 ) conduct formal program evaluation consist process evaluation ( understand whether optimal implementation strategy performs intend ( e.g . actual versus plan ) assessment barrier facilitator implementation ) outcomes evaluation relevant clinical performance indicator , patient clinician outcome . The outcome evaluation design hypothesis generating , hypothesis testing . Finally , toolbox educational material implementation tool decision support tool ( e.g. , documentation template ) develop project .</detailed_description>
