	<brief_summary>This research do determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) improve certain mental ability , speech , language effort communication individual autism . In research , battery power device use deliver weak electrical current surface scalp participant involve task aim train measure communicative effort , speech , language relate cognitive function . Our aim find whether tDCS improve mental ability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants study ask following thing : - Grant permission researcher view medical/psychological and/or educational and/or speech record associate diagnosis low-functioning autism . - Complete questionnaire provide health history . - Complete evaluation study team ass diagnosis gain clearer understand participant 's current functioning . - Give permission audio video-tape test session later score observation . - Give permission audio video-tape classroom home environment use non-intrusive audio-visual recording device . - Complete several task train intervention involve thing learn new word picture , say word loud , naming object . - Participate eye track study complete task computer involve wear headband , attach velcro fastener , contain magnetic sensor . This equipment allow u track position head order record accurate measurement . It use eye track equipment measure gaze set point computer screen . The equipment pose risk non-invasive . - Participate computerized task monitor brain response direct result think perception . In order monitor response , electrode would place various point scalp . The electrodes record on-going activity brain ; produce introduce electrical activity . The equipment pose risk non-invasive . - Wear electrode place scalp large rubberize band . These electrode administer weak electrical current ( tDCS ) battery power device 20 60 minute . The experimental session last 1 hour participant may ask one test session day return additional session .</detailed_description>
