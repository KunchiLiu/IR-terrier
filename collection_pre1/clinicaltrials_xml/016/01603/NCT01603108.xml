	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine administration poorly-absorbable antibiotic ( rifaximin ) first three month liver transplant reduce amount fibrosis ( scar liver ) liver transplant patient recurrent hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) lower serum lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , protein blood come bacteria intestine may cause scar liver . Approximately 60 subject participate study . Subjects part study approximately 1 year post transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) common chronic liver infection remain leading indication liver transplantation ( LT ) . Although LT cure cirrhosis liver , always cure HCV infection reinfection post-transplanted liver . Post-LT recurrent HCV lead accelerate liver fibrosis . Chronic exposure lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) gut-derived bacteria show elevated level patient cirrhosis due HCV compare normal control . Therefore , investigator hypothesize LPS contributes cause liver fibrosis , specifically patient post-LT recurrent HCV , effect maybe modify poorly absorb antibiotic , rifaximin , alter gut flora patient .</detailed_description>
