	<brief_summary>Bowel cancer common disorder UK . Most cancer happen type polyp , call adenoma , become cancerous . Polyps growths large bowel cancerous , non-cancerous , pre-cancerous ( adenoma ) . Polyps commonly detect colonoscopy ( camera test lower bowel ) . The removal adenomas show reduce subsequent risk bowel cancer . Current practice polyp remove biopsied allow laboratory diagnosis ( histology ) . This important influence patient require follow-up colonoscopy , know surveillance interval . Patients non-cancerous polyp need surveillance . A new blue light technology , call narrow band imaging ( NBI ) , use colonoscopy help colonoscopists ( doctor nurse perform procedure ) differentiate polyp type colonoscopy . NBI currently available large number UK endoscopy unit however variably use . Studies 'expert ' centre demonstrate NBI allow accurate optical diagnosis colonic polyp . Benefits optical diagnosis include avoid removal non-cancerous polyp immediate ( day ) diagnosis patient include surveillance interval . The primary aim study evaluate accuracy colonoscopists assess require surveillance interval use optical diagnosis compare histology non-expert centre . The investigator invite 2500 patient , refer colonoscopy , participate . Patients undergo routine colonoscopy addition use NBI procedure . Colonoscopists provide optical diagnosis time colonoscopy addition polyp removal biopsy . The investigator compare surveillance interval provide use optical diagnosis diagnosis histology thereby accuracy colonoscopists use technology . The investigator also calculate cost saving NHS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) continue major problem UK second common cause cancer death . The annual incidence approximately 30,000 case annual mortality rate region 16,000 ( 1 ) . Most sporadic non-hereditary CRCs arise benign colorectal adenoma ( 2 ) . The detection resection colorectal adenoma colonoscopy show reduce subsequent risk CRC much 80 % ( 3 ) . The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme ( BCSP ) begin roll-out 2006 England April 2010 , establish across 99.4 % country . The BCSP base strategy biennial faecal occult blood test ( FOBt ) screen men woman age 60-75 , follow colonoscopy test positive . Among aims detection resection potentially pre-malignant colorectal adenoma thereby potentially reduce incidence CRC . The introduction BCSP result dramatically increased demand colonoscopy . To date approximately 80,000 colonoscopy perform within BCSP least one adenoma find half procedure ( 4 ) . In addition , 2012 , BCSP introduce flexible sigmoidoscopy screen individual age 55 yr old . This extrapolate approximately 500,000 flexible sigmoidoscopy per year , least one polyp expect find 75,000 procedure . Greater 90 % polyp detect colonoscopy small ( 6-9mm ) diminutive ( ≤5mm ) , latter make majority ( 5-7 ) . In addition , approximately 50 % small polyp non-neoplastic ( 8 ) , know adenoma . The number adenomas present strongly influence future risk development advance neoplasia individual patient therefore determines decision future surveillance interval . As result even small polyp , little risk harbour cancer , currently send histological assessment order determine whether adenomatous ( 9-11 ) . The ability correctly diagnose small polyp ( &lt; 10mm ) colonoscopy adenomatous non-adenomatous endoscopic characteristic ( optical diagnosis ) would allow small adenoma resect discard without need retrieve polyp formal histological assessment . Additionally , hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyp leave situ thereby reduce need polypectomy associated risk . Optical diagnosis would also enable surveillance interval determine immediately colonoscopy thereby avoid need out-patient follow , potentially lead significant time cost saving . Notably , histological assessment imperfect current gold standard polyp may lose unable assess due diathermy artefact 8-25 % case . Furthermore , standard histological technique may misclassify 15 % adenoma benign lesion . Narrow band imaging ( NBI ; Olympus , Japan ( 12 , 13 ) ) new 'blue light ' optical imaging modality available push button colonoscope head . By enhance mucosal detail particular vascular structure allow assessment microvascular density ( vascular pattern intensity - VPI ( 14 ) ; mesh brown capillary network ( 15-17 ) ) . Neoplastic tissue characterize increased angiogenesis , therefore , adenomas appear darker view NBI . The use microvascular assessment appear short learn curve , short 60 histologically verified polyp ( 18-20 ) , make potentially attractive practical option optical diagnosis . There known adverse event associate NBI . Two study date assess clinical implication endoscopic diagnosis small polyp surveillance interval use white light combination NBI . A study diminutive polyp ( ≤5 mm ) perform single expert colonoscopist ( 21 ) , 134 136 ( 98.5 % ) patient would surveillance interval recommendation base optical histological diagnosis compare . Similar result report study perform three co-applicants ( AI , JEE , BPS ) ( 22 ) 82 130 patient could give surveillance interval immediately colonoscopy base optical diagnosis alone interval find formal histopathology 80 patient ( 98 % ) use British Society Gastroenterology guideline ( 23 ) . Optical diagnosis accurately diagnose 186 198 adenoma ( sensitivity 0.94 ; 95 % CI 0.90-0.97 ) 55 62 hyperplastic polyp ( specificity 0.89 ; 0.78 -0.95 ) overall accuracy 241 260 ( 0.93 ; 0.89-0.96 ) small polyp characterisation . In study , use simple cost analysis , author estimate optical diagnosis would result 77 % cost saving polyp analysis clinical follow ( £13343 130 patient examine ) . Using Markov modelling , Hassan et al model cost-effectiveness 'resect discard policy ' find use diminutive polyp ( ≤5mm ) would result annual save $ 33 million apply colonoscopy screen US population ( correspond overall save $ 330 million , assume cumulative period 10 year screen quarter US population ) ( 24 ) . Optical diagnosis may therefore benefit : 1 . Patients : Shorter , accurate examination few complication result few polypectomy ( less perforation bleeding ) , reduce anxiety ( await histology result ) appropriate use endoscopic surveillance programme . 2 . NHS Healthcare provider : Increased efficiency ( short list , exam per endoscopy list , few out-patient appointment , avoids unnecessary use histology capacity ) reduce risk ( few complication few polyp 'misses ' ) . Since need histology set greatly increase expansion screening , move routine use NBI may substantially reduce need expand histology service . We foresee significant constraint adoption optical diagnosis financial cost easily offset saving efficiency benefit describe 90 % polyp detect colonoscopy &lt; 10mm size therefore suitable optical biopsy . Study Design DISCARD 2 blind calibration diagnostic study compare NBI optical diagnosis histological assessment ( reference standard ) patient small polyp ( &lt; 10mm ) identify colonoscopy Recruitment Patients due attend routine colonoscopy identify out-patient clinic , colonoscopy booking , day colonoscopy participate site . Patients send give information pack contain information sheet consent form . There two phase recruitment study . All consent patient undergo colonoscopy include phase 1 study . Those undergo complete colonoscopy one polyp &lt; 10mm diameter find enter phase 2 study . More detail regard inclusion exclusion criterion outcome measure provide .</detailed_description>
