	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) imaging technique show internal structure live tissue ( vivo ) . It safe , quick painless perform , damage tissue way . Recent advance technology mean use take image internal structure skin . This useful certain condition , skin cancer , alter structure . At present suspected skin cancer identify take sample ( biopsy ) analyse microscope confirm diagnosis . The cancer excise include margin apparently healthy-looking skin around ensure entirety tumour remove . The excised tumour analyse microscope confirm indeed completely remove ( histology ) , operation require repair defect . The purpose study evaluate OCT image particular type skin cancer call basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , particular BCCs affect skin around eye ( periocular ) . The study compare ability OCT define margin BCC current 'gold standard ' histology . OCT could potentially improve investigator ability define margin tumour surgery become guide minimally invasive surgery . The preservation healthy tissue represent priority , particularly area skin surround eye .</brief_summary>
