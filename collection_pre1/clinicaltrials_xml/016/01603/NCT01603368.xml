	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Mortality incidence severe complication still high among extremely premature infant . Common cause severe complication population poor nutrition , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , severe infection . Feeding intolerance also common problem result prolong need intravenous line poor nutrition . There scientific evidence dietary supplement probiotic may effect manifestation . Lactobacillus reuteri well study probiotic bacterium test several clinical study premature infant old child , result study animal study suggest bacterium may also effect growth mortality extremely premature infant . Lactobacillus reuteri reduces colonization pathogenic microbe , stimulates gastric intestinal motility shorten hospital stay moderately premature infant . In animal model , L. reuteri also induce anti-inflammatory immune response , reduces symptoms inflammatory bowel disease incidence NEC . Administration L. reuteri also improve intestinal barrier human study child animal study . Dietary supplement L. reuteri extremely premature infant may therefore improve feed tolerance nutrition reduce incidence severe complication population . HYPOTHESIS Premature infants extremely low birth weight receive daily supplement Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 reach full enteral feeding faster compare child receive placebo . STUDY DESIGN This study conduct prospective multi-center double blind placebo-controlled study neonatal intensive care unit Sweden . In total 134 neonate extremely low birth weight ( &lt; 1000g ) gestational age &lt; 28+0 week randomize receive either dietary supplement Lactobacillus reuteri placebo . Study product identical active placebo group besides addition Lactobacillus reuteri ( 1.25 x 100 million bacteria=0.2 ml oil drop per day ) active group . The supplementation commence within 1-3 day birth give daily gestational week 36+0 . The infant follow gestational week 36+0 data feed tolerance , nutrition , growth , infection , NEC , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , death , potential confounders enter individual study protocol . Stool , breast milk , blood sample collect analysis possible underlying mechanism .</detailed_description>
