	<brief_summary>MELAS patient suffer exercise intolerance , weakness , poor vision blindness , poor growth , developmental delay , deafness . They also unique 'stroke-like ' episode ( SLEs ) due blockage large medium artery . These 'strokes ' thought due energy failure small brain blood vessel combine energy failure mitochondrion ( cell battery ) brain cell , especially back region brain vision centre . This lead visual loss paralysis . The overall goal study well understand mechanism SLEs level brain cell small blood vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>L-arginine Therapy Endothelium-dependent Vasodilation &amp; Mitochondrial Metabolism MELAS Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We study family 3 sibling , different severity MELAS , use safe , non-invasive test . We determine whether decrease ability small brain blood vessel increase blood flow dilate response certain stimulus increase blood carbon dioxide level response brain cell activation vision centre visual stimulus . We use technique call BOLD-fMRI detect change brain blood flow . As exercise muscle also depend increased blood flow mitochondrial energy , study different measure aerobic energy metabolism exercise muscle use cycle exercise test special phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy measure change major chemical muscle energy metabolism . The dietary amino acid L-arginine known dilate blood vessel increase blood flow decrease toxic free radical generate dysfunctional mitochondrion . We determine effect single dose 6 week trial oral L-arginine , brain blood vessel reactivity , brain cell activation muscle aerobic function see useful would treatment patient mitochondrial disorder present stroke .</detailed_description>
