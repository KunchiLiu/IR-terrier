	<detailed_description>There 5 dose group . At begin dose group , 1 subject receive normal saline placebo 1 receive active dose . The remainder dose group receive dos begin 48 hr later , safety evaluation . Dosing remain subject dose group occur 1 time , dose subsequent subject separate minimum 24 hr . Subsequent dose group receive dos begin approximately 2 week dose precede group , pending safety analysis . The single dos administer cohort 0.2 , 0.6 , 2 , 6 , 20 mg/kg , respectively . The start dose 0.2 mg/kg , high dose 20 mg/kg ( maximum 1,500 mg ) , least 20-fold low observable adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) rat ensure subject safety . Ch-mAb7F9 administer intravenously ( IV ) saline flush clear administration tube residual ch-mAb7F9 . Each dose ch-mAb7F9 dilute 225 ml saline give two hour .</detailed_description>
