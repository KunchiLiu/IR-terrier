	<brief_summary>The underlying hypothesis whole body cholesterol - include cholesterol present tissue measure standard blood test - related heart disease risk . Endogenous cholesterol label intravenous infusion one type cholesterol tracer dietary cholesterol label another . These tracer use measure fast cholesterol synthesize excrete use mass spectrometry distinguish tracer . Data relate circulate biomarkers ( blood test ) thickness line carotid artery . The effect drug ezetimibe process also determine . Successful completion study give u knowledge cholesterol metabolism may useful design new drug treatment patient heart disease , especially already receive maximum amount current medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The central hypothesis proposal reverse cholesterol transport relate coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk . It complementary concept reduction cholesterol biosynthesis statin drug prevents CHD , focus whole body cholesterol metabolism kinetic cholesterol transport rather static level circulate lipoprotein . Although old idea , adequately test human lack suitable method . In proposal apply innovative stable isotope mass spectroscopic technology study reverse cholesterol transport human subject . The first specific aim improve preparation intravenous deuterated cholesterol tracer , critical limiting element study whole body cholesterol metabolism . The second aim use intravenous tracer , along different oral tracer , partition fecal cholesterol excrete endogenous cholesterol , unabsorbed dietary cholesterol newly-synthesized cholesterol derive liver intestine . Measurements make consumption control diet provide metabolic kitchen . The pool size rapidly-mixing body cholesterol pool measure along fractional rate cholesterol catabolism . These direct measure reverse cholesterol transport correlate plasma biomarkers metabolic covariates . The relation reverse cholesterol transport carotid intima-media thickness determine . The third specific aim use similar method study mechanism action widely-used drug ezetimibe . The fractional rate endogenous cholesterol excretion rate plasma cholesterol turnover determine two period , one drug one placebo treatment . This work represent new direction cholesterol research potential develop new complementary method reduce CHD risk add diet statin drug treatment .</detailed_description>
