	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I part clinical research study find high tolerable dose vemurafenib Aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ) give combination interferon alfa-2b patient advance metastatic melanoma . The safety combination also study . The goal Phase II learn study drug combination help control advanced metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Therapy With Interferon , Interleukin-2 BRAF Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 6 participant enrol Phase I portion study 53 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose vemurafenib aldesleukin receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level vemurafenib aldesleukin . Each new group receive high dose vemurafenib aldesleukin group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dos vemurafenib aldesleukin found . If enrol Phase II portion , receive vemurafenib aldesleukin high dos tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level interferon alfa-2b . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . You take vemurafenib mouth twice day ( 1 time morning 1 time even ) every day study cycle . Vemurafenib take without food . If miss schedule dose vemurafenib , try `` make '' dose take 2 dos next schedule dosing time . Continue take study drug schedule . You receive aldesleukin vein 96 hour Days 1-4 study cycle . To receive aldesleukin , central venous catheter ( CVC ) insert , already one . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . You receive interferon alfa-2b injection skin Days 1-5 study cycle . Supportive Drugs : You give drug help low risk side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . Study Visits : The following test procedure perform : On Day 1 ( +/- 3 day ) cycle : - Your performance status record . - Your vital sign measure . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - You EKG . Your skin check non-melanoma skin cancer Day 1 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) every 3 cycle . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . On Day 1 cycle , blood use check liver kidney function . At end cycle ( Day 21 ) , physical exam , include measurement weight . Any tumor felt hand measure measure tape physical exam see change size . On Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) every 2 cycle , chest x-ray CT MRI scan check status disease . Anytime doctor think need , photo skin lesion take . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless lesion face . Length Study : You may take study drug combination long doctor think benefit . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit Within 14 day stop take study drug combination , follow test procedure perform : - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug may take side effect may . vBlood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Â° If doctor think need , CT MRI scan . Follow-Up Every 3 month 3 year , contact phone clinic visit see . The phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Vemurafenib , interferon alfa-2b , Aldesleukin FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic cancer . Giving drug combination investigational . The study doctor tell study drug design work . Up 71 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
