	<brief_title>External Beam Radiation With Without Chemotherapy Treat High Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommend treatment high risk prostate cancer consist combination radiation therapy androgen suppression 2-3 year . Recent study show survival advantage chemotherapy prostate cancer . Chemotherapy already successfully integrated treatment cancer type belief chemotherapy prove beneficial patient high risk prostate cancer . However , clinical study necessary compare result good bad chemotherapy radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
