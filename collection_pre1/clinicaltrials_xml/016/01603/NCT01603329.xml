	<brief_summary>The goal project increase patient adherence medication use communication incentive physician .

	<brief_title>Increasing Medication Adherence Through Physician Incentives Messaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional economics would suggest best way maximize adherence would give physician financial incentive improve adherence relevant drug , communication physician emphasize relevant drug . Behavioral economics suggest theory suggests emphasize everything , effectively emphasize nothing . Behavioral econonmics would suggest maximize adherence one give physicians financial incentive improve adherence small number relevant drug , communication physician emphasize small number relevant drug . This allow physician focus energy reduces probability give 're overwhelm , word , avoid phenomenon call metric fatigue . Humana already implement incentive program physician , investigator work design program focus medication adherence . Physicians target pilot could also enrol another Humana incentives program , incentives program act independently . There two treatment dimension investigator test via random assignment practice level : 1 . Physicians give financial incentive improve patient medication adherence follow medication : oral diabetes medication , hypertension ( ACEI ARB ) medication , cholesterol ( statin ) medication vs. one follow medication : oral diabetes medication , hypertension ( ACEI ARB ) medication , cholesterol ( statin ) medication . 2 . Physicians give communication emphasize importance improve adherence previous medication class vs. one one previous medication class . In previous study increase uptake colonoscopy among employee partner firm , investigator find use post note catch attention employee statistically significantly increase colonoscopy uptake control group . The investigator also employ eye catch method propose pilot . When physician send communication regard opportunity receive incentive part pilot , also receive single patient sheet patient le 80 % adherence . They encourage include patient sheet chart reminder discus medication adherence patient next time see . For half arm , investigator make patient sheet bright , non-white , color , order futher draw physician ' attention specific paper chart . Our experimental arm : 1 . Comprehensive incentive + comprehensive communication 2 . Comprehensive incentive + comprehensive communication + print bright non-white paper 3 . Focused incentive + focus communication ( one three drug class ) 4 . Focused incentive + focus communication + print bright non-white paper ( one three drug class ) 5 . Comprehensive communiation 6 . Comprehensive communication + print bright non-white paper 7 . Control arm : communication + incentives The investigator hypothesize physician receive focus incentive focus communication patient increase medication adherence physician receive comprehensive incentive comprehensive communication . The investigator also hypothsize physician receive patient sheet use bright , non-white paper patient increase medication adherence physician receive plain white patient sheet .</detailed_description>
