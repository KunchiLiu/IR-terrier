	<brief_summary>Sunitinib everolimus two new treatment approved 2011 patient pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) . In addition , traditional chemotherapy often use treat pancreatic NETs . Traditional chemotherapy also know `` cytotoxic therapy '' work kill cell actively divide . There study compare different type treatment . Since patient eligible treatment either sunitinib , everolimus traditional chemotherapy help u identify factor may help future patient benefit therapy .</brief_summary>
