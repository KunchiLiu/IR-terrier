	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Proof-Of-Concept Study Of Intravitreal AL-78898A In Patients With Geographic Atrophy ( GA ) Associated With Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize 2:1 ratio receive AL-78898A sham injection . The study eye assess injection ensure injection procedure and/or study medication endanger health eye . The Investigator determine month whether patient eligible receive next injection . The study terminate due high likelihood continue enrollment would reach predefined study stop criterion base upon number patient drug deposit formation , make assessment efficacy futile .</detailed_description>
