	<brief_summary>This propose laboratory study extend previous finding relationship cognitive function nutritional status condition closely resemble military operation aerobic exercise , inadequate nutritional intake sleep deprivation combine degrade cognitive function . The investigator examine cognitive function , brain activity glucose level volunteer calorie-deprived , perform high workload cognitive test , exercise , one arm study , sleep-deprived approximately 48 hour . A comprehensive cognitive test battery repeatedly administer several cognitive test administer volunteer exercise . Interstitial glucose level assess whole body nitrogen utilization determine . The effect energy restriction physiological basis relationship peripheral glucose level cognitive function examine use state-of-the-art imaging technology , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) . This technique allow key brain region affect caloric deprivation identify .</brief_summary>
