	<brief_summary>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Therapy ( NMRT ) gain novel mode therapy osteoarthrosis . A prospective double blind randomise study 100 patient conducted investigate efficacy NMRT treatment mild moderate osteoarthrosis ( OA ) knee joint . The null hypothesis benefit NMRT placebo mild moderate oteoarthosis knee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study approve Regional Ethics Committee . Patients recruit referral make General Practitioners single Orthopaedic Outpatient Department October 2007 February 2008 . The study prospective placebo control , double blind randomise mono centric study follow period 6 month . All potential trial participant demonstrate symptomatic mild moderate OA knee joint diagnose experienced consultant orthopaedic surgeon . Radiographic evidence gather mean standard clinical stand antero-posterior lateral radiograph knee . Baseline assessment include : 1. clinical examination 2. active Range movement 3. plain radiograph 4 . WOMAC osteoarthritis index 5 . Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ) 6 . Severity pain VAS . 7 . Strength frequency painkiller take . 8 . Phyasiotherapy Study design direct use NMRT clinical setting . It therefore consider valid restrict use pain killer physiotherapy . Positional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( pMRI ) scan knee joint undertaken . Randomisation carry mean visually identical computer chip card number 1 100 independently program manufacturer . Thus , half computer chip card ( n=50 ) program activate magnetic field ( = treatment group ) remain half ( n=50 ) program activate magnetic field ( =placebo group ) device . The research team patient blind programmed activity card . The magnetic resonance indicator LED lamp device disable manufacturer ensure operator patient blind therapy status . Every patient enter study ask choose numbered card available , card use operate device specific patient five session NMRT . The study use manufacturer 's clinical recommendation therapy . Patients subject one-hour session NMRT ( placebo ) five consecutive day , give total five hour NMRT ( placebo ) . This give outpatient basis . The device make twelve independently control coil system space orthogonally . These design produce 3-dimensional therapy field . Along separately generate permanent magnetic field , 3-dimensional therapy field form nuclear resonance field center coil system . The desired dose NMRT achieve help MBSTÂ® - Treatment software , control computer chip card . The device generate magnetic field 3.0 mT ( typical ) maximum 10 mT extend 30 cm around device . Patients call review 1 week ( 1w ) , 1 month ( 1m ) , 3 month ( 3m ) 6 month ( 6m ) clinical examination , WOMAC osteoarthritis index OKS repeat . They also ask record VAS detail painkiller take week review . Due lack recognise analgesia equivalencies , quantity pain killer take grade reference amount frequency take baseline - less baseline grade 1 , baseline grade 2 baseline grade 3 .</detailed_description>
