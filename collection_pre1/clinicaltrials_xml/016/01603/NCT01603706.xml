	<detailed_description>In study propose evaluate utility radial strain image use speckle track predict response CRT patient ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICMP ) NYHA functional class 2-4 heart failure standard guideline-based CRT indication , determine value lead localization determine radial strain image prospective , randomized manner . We compare two randomized group CRT recipient implant CRT-D system . In control group , implantation perform usual manner lead place discretion implant physician , preferably posterolateral LV site . In study group , lead place area late contraction lack significant scar , determine speckle track imaging . The primary outcome measure comparison 2 group echocardiographic response ( assessed percent reduction leave ventricular end systolic volume ) 6 month post-implantation . In addition , clinical response parameter also measure secondary end point . We hypothesize 1 ) patient show great dyssynchrony and/or discoordination index speckle track derive significantly great response cardiac resynchronization therapy ; 2 ) patient allocate image-guided LV lead placement group derive significantly great response CRT patient non- guided implantation ( control ) group . If radial strain image prof useful improve CRT response rate identification patient likely respond , important clinical economic implication improve individual outcome effective utilization constrain health care resource . Furthermore , echo-guided lead implantation prove effective reduce relatively large non-response rate cardiac resynchronization therapy , likely result increase device utilization among eligible heart failure patient . Specific Aims Aim # 1 : To show patient ischemic cardiomyopathy , implantation CRT LV lead guide radial strain image result significantly great echocardiographic clinical response cardiac resynchronization therapy compare conventional implantation technique . Aim # 2 : To show speckle track strain data use identify degree echocardiographic response CRT , use dyssynchrony ( time peak strain ) discoordination index . Aim # 3 : The Paieon substudy comprise 40 patient enrol 3 center , additional information mechanical dyssynchrony , use Paieon CardioGuide motion map , collect device implantation detail The primary aim study relate data mechanical dyssynchrony obtain angiography Paieon CardioGuide motion map dyssynchrony data obtain echocardiogram . The dyssynchrony data available treat physician use direct LV lead location .</detailed_description>
