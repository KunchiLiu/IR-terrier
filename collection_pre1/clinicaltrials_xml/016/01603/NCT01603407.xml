	<detailed_description>Boys Duchenne muscular dystrophy experience progressive muscle weakness grow . Corticosteroids currently medicine show increase muscle strength boys DMD . Benefits include increase length time boy could continue walk , reduction development curvature spine , long time adequate breathing , possible protection development heart problem . Doctors try different way prescribe corticosteroid order decrease undesirable side effect drug . No controlled , long-term study ever look effect different corticosteroid see one improve strength one cause few side effect , period time . Different doctor different country prescribe drug different way , prescribe corticosteroid . The FOR DMD study enroll boys DMD age 4-7 . The study look three way take follow corticosteroid mouth determine increase muscle strength , cause few side effect : 1 . Prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day 2 . Prednisone 0.75mg/kg/day switch 10 day 10 day treatment 3 . Deflazacort 0.9mg/kg/day . The study take place 40 academic medical center United States , Canada , United Kingdom , Germany Italy .</detailed_description>
