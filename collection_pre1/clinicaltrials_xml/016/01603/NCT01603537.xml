	<brief_summary>Trauma lead cause death among person 60 year age . It well-established belief optimal treatment early phase trauma major impact mortality , implementation specific educational program trauma care widely adopt strategy aim improve outcome . This strategy high face validity , underlie evidence poor . The Prehospital Trauma Life Support ( PHTLS ) program introduce 1983 aim integrate prehospital trauma care Advanced Trauma Life Support ( ATLS ) program . Approximately half million prehospital caregiver 50 country take PHTLS course . It recognize one lead educational program prehospital emergency trauma care . However , scientific support improve patient outcome course PHTLS ATLS limit . According Cochrane analysis publish 2010 evidence recommend advance life-support ( ALS ) train ambulance crew . Another Cochrane analysis concern ATLS give similar result recent study indicate even worsen outcome implementation ATLS . An observational study county Uppsala indicate reduced mortality implementation PHTLS estimate uncertain due low overall mortality . The aim study investigate association PHTLS training ambulance crew member outcome trauma patient large study population . To accomplish investigator use epidemiological semi-individual design apply victim traffic injury occur implementation period PHTLS course Sweden ( 1998-2004 ) . Four outcome subsets patient analyze : Mortality hospital admission , mortality within 30 day , time death among survivor hospital admission return work among survivor hospital discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Source Population : Sweden divide 21 administrative region provide health care ( county ) . In 2004 Sweden population 9 million inhabitant average population density 20 inhabitants/km2 . The Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) -System : The ambulance staff Sweden consist register nurse emergency medical technician ( EMT ) equivalent ( nurse assistant special ambulance training ) . Statistics : Hierarchical random effect model use model binary outcome . Cox proportional hazard model analyze time event outcomes . The difference mean predict outcome PHTLS group non-PHTLS group use estimate absolute risk reduction .</detailed_description>
