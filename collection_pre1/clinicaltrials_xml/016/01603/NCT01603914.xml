	<brief_summary>The aim project answer follow question : To determine incidence catheter relate bacteremia ( CRB ) three strategy central venous catheter exchange critically ill adult patient major burn determine regimen minimize risk bacteremia . To determine incidence rate catheter colonization adult patient major burn . The scientific knowledge acquire project likely benefit care critically ill patient burns injury follow : The intention improve outcome critically ill patient minimize one frequent cause infection Burn Intensive Care Unit , central venous catheter . Decreasing infection decrease morbidity , decrease length stay , decrease cost , decrease mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : To determine incidence catheter-related bacteremia ( CRB ) three primary schedule central venous catheter exchange adult critically ill patient major burn injury . Hypothesis : A strategy catheter exchange accord clinical criterion result CRB compare routine catheter change without guidewire exchange strategy frequent guidewire exchange frequent new-site replacement . Background : The intravenous catheter-related bacteremia ( ICRB ) nosocomial infection affect patient admit intensive care lead increase morbidity . Accumulative incidence rate ICRB 5.5 infection per 1000 catheters-day . Several strategy propose decrease rate ICRB critically ill patient . However , agreement recommend replacement pattern central venous catheter adult critically ill patient major burn strategy reduction intravenous catheter-associated bacteremia . Objectives . To compare three strategy replacement central venous catheter prevention ICRB . Find risk mechanical complication associate strategy central venous catheter replacement . Method . Randomized , multicenter clinical trial , single blind compare three strategy intravenous catheter replacement patient major burn : schedule wire-guided strategy every six day : second , schedule strategy replacement every six day different punction third , re-change strategy guide clinical criterion suspicion catheter-associated infection . Primary outcome : catheter colonization rate rate intravenous catheter-associated bacteremia . Secondarily , calculate incidence rate colonization central venous catheter finally analyze associate complication . This project require enough patient show difference three intervention group . A significant decrease infection rate would current 20 infection per 1000 catheter day approximately 15 per 1000 catheter day . This would require minimum 1000 catheter day per group .</detailed_description>
