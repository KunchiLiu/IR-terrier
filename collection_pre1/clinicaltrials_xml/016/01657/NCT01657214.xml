	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : In dose escalation : determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SAR125844 . In expansion cohort : evaluate preliminary anti-tumoral effect SAR125844 patient measurable MET gene amplification ( include gastric cancer patient ) . Secondary Objectives : To characterize confirm global safety profile SAR125844 include cumulative toxicity . To assess preliminary antitumor activity SAR125844 . To explore pharmacodynamic effect ( PDy ) SAR125844 . To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile SAR125844 . To explore relationship MET gene amplification status antitumor effect . To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For cohort , escalation expansion , duration study one patient include period inclusion 3 week 4-week treatment cycle ( ) .The patient may continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity willingness stop , follow minimum 30-days follow-up . If patient treat dose escalation part expansion cohort , continue benefit treatment time Clinical Study Report , patient continue study treatment maximum 1 year continue undergo assessment per study flowchart . Such patient follow least 30 day last IMP administration .</detailed_description>
