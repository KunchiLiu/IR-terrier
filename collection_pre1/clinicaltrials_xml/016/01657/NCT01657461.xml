	<criteria>1 . Age 18 80 2 . Clinical sign consistent acute ischemic stroke 3 . Prestroke Modified Rankin Score ≤ 1 4 . NIHSS ≥ 8 &lt; 30 time randomization 5 . Initiation IV tPA within 4.5 hour onset stroke symptom ( onset time define last time patient witness baseline ) , investigator verification subject receive / receive correct IV tPA dose estimate weight prior randomization . 6 . Thrombolysis Cerebral Infarction ( TICI ) 01 flow intracranial internal carotid artery , M1 segment MCA , carotid terminus confirm CT MR angiography accessible Solitaire™ FR Device . 7 . Subject able treat within 6 hour onset stroke symptom within 1.5 hour ( 90 minute ) CTA MRA groin puncture . 8 . Subject willing conduct protocolrequired followup visit . 9 . An appropriate sign date Informed Consent Form ( allow accord country regulation approve ethic committee and/or IRB ) obtain 10 . Subject affiliated social security system ( require individual country regulation ) . 11 . Subject meet national regulatory criterion clinical trial participation . 1 . Subject contraindicate IV tPA per local national guideline . 2 . Female pregnant lactate positive pregnancy test time admission . 3 . As applicable French law , subject protect individual incompetent adult incarcerate person . 4 . Rapid neurological improvement prior study randomization suggest resolution signs/symptoms stroke . 5 . Known serious sensitivity radiographic contrast agent . 6 . Known sensitivity Nickel , Titanium metal alloys . 7 . Current participation another investigational drug device treatment study . 8 . Known hereditary acquire hemorrhagic diathesis , coagulation factor deficiency . ( A subject without history suspicion coagulopathy require INR prothrombin time lab result available prior enrollment . ) 9 . Renal Failure define serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl ( 176.8 μmol/l ) Glomerular Filtration Rate [ GFR ] &lt; 30Warfarin therapy INR great 1.7 . 10 . Subject require hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis , contraindication angiogram whatever reason 11 . Life expectancy le 90 day . 12 . Clinical presentation suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage , even initial CT MRI scan normal . 13 . Suspicion aortic dissection . 14 . Subject comorbid disease condition would confound neurological functional evaluation compromise survival ability complete followup assessment . 15 . Subject currently use recent history illicit drug ( ) abuse alcohol ( defined regular daily consumption 4 alcoholic drink per day ) . 16 . Known history arterial tortuosity , preexist stent , and/or arterial disease would prevent device reach target vessel and/or preclude safe recovery device . Imaging 1 . Computed tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) evidence hemorrhage presentation . 2 . CT MRI evidence mass effect intracranial tumor ( except small meningioma ) . 3 . CT MRI evidence cerebral vasculitis . 4 . CT show hypodensity MRI show hyperintensity involve great 1/3 middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) territory ( territory , &gt; 100 cc tissue ) presentation . 5 . Baseline noncontrast CT DWI MRI evidence moderate/large core define extensive early ischemic change Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score ( ASPECTS ) &lt; 6 . 6 . CT MRI evidence basilar artery ( BA ) occlusion posterior cerebral artery ( PCA ) occlusion . 7 . CTA MRA evidence carotid dissection complete cervical carotid occlusion require stenting time index procedure ( i.e. , mechanical thrombectomy ) 8 . Imaging evidence suggests , opinion investigator , subject appropriate mechanical thrombectomy intervention ( e.g. , inability navigate target lesion , moderate/large infarct poor collateral circulation , etc ) .</criteria>
