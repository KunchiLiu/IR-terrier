	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom syndrome characterized urgency frequency without urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) may affect patient ' quality life . Current medical treatment usually unsuccessful completely eradicate urgency sensation . Intra-detrusor injection botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) modulate release neurotransmitter sensory nerve ending effectively modulate inflammatory process mediate nociceptive afferent nerve dysfunction . Satisfactory clinical result achieve intravesical BoNT-A injection , increase bladder capacity decrease urgency sensation patient neurogenic idiopathic detrusor overactivity ( NDO , IDO ) . Excellent result achieve injection either 100 U 200 U BoNT-A . Episodes frequency , urgency , UUI reduce , maximal cystometric capacity increase , maximal detrusor pressure ( Pdet ) decrease , quality life index also improve significantly . However , post void residual ( PVR ) volume increase significantly patient required clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) evacuate PVR . Dose-related adverse event ( AE ) increase increase dose BoNT-A . Therefore , adjustments BoNT-A dose site injection might minimize de novo AE help maintain success rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design single blind , randomize , parallel , actively control trial . The urodynamic DO confirm patient randomly assign receive injection onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U ( BoNT-A , Allergan , Irvine , California , USA ) , reconstitute 10 ml normal saline suburothelial injection , one three group follow injection number : ( A ) 100 U 10ml injection , 1.0ml injection , totally 10 injection bladder body ( B ) 100 U 10ml , 0.5ml injection , totally 20 injection bladder body , ( C ) 100 U 10ml , 0.25ml injection , totally 40 injection bladder body . Permuted block randomization use trial . All treatment evaluate baseline primary end-point 3 month . The inclusion criterion patient either gender , age 20 year , urodynamic DO least one episode urgency ( urgency severity scale , USS≥2 ) UUI per day record 3-day voiding diary . Patients neurogenic bladder , urodynamically confirm bladder outlet obstruction , prior pelvic surgery , anti-incontinence surgery urinary tract infection ( UTI , white blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 10/high power field ( HPF ) urinalysis ) exclude . Informed consent obtain patient randomization . This study approve Institution Review Board Ethics Committee hospital . All patient manage behavioral modification treat certain number antimuscarinics 4 week enrol trial . Antimuscarinics discontinue day screen wash remain effect obtain void diary may reflect true bladder condition . The injection method patient record operation note study nurse control outcome measure blind treatment assignment . All procedure perform transurethrally intravenous general anesthesia operation room . Anticoagulant discontinue 1 week prior onabotulinumtoxinA treatment . The bladder volume keep 100-150 ml blood vessel avoid injection . An indwelling Foley catheter place bladder overnight patient discharge next morning . Broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotic give postoperatively 3 day . Patients develop acute urinary retention ( AUR ) PVR volume great 250 ml advise perform CIC periodically evacuate bladder . The patient monitor outpatient clinic regularly upto 24 month symptom return baseline level . Videourodynamic study routinely perform baseline , 3 6 month measure urodynamic variable detect vesicoureteral reflux . The measured urodynamic variable include : maximum flow rate ( Qmax ) , PVR , cystometric bladder capacity ( CBC ) , detrusor pressure Qmax ( Pdet ) void efficiency ( VE ) . The procedure definition videourodynamic study accordance recommendation International Continence Society .</detailed_description>
