	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma aggressive tumour poor prognosis despite current multimodal treatment . Hence , clear need new , effective therapy , among immune therapy emerge promising treatment option . When interpret follow-up magnetic resonance ( MR ) examination , radiologist often confront image difficult interpret conventional anatomical imaging technique . The difference tumour relapse therapy-mediated change always distinctive . In project , investigator attempt characterize inflammatory response parameter advance MRI technique like MR spectroscopy , MR perfusion image MR-diffusion imaging . These technique allow characterization cellular property like metabolism tissue structure respectively . Doing , investigator monitor disease evolution order timely detect treatment failure , thereby allow appropriate switch patient management .</brief_summary>
