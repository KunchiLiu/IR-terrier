	<brief_summary>Alcohol use disorder ( AUDs ) highly prevalent among U.S. civilian , even prevalent U.S . Veteran population . AUDs frequently co-morbid depressive symptom psychiatric clinical population , result increased severity condition . Indeed , return Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) /Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Veterans extraordinarily high rate alcohol misuse co-morbid psychiatric symptom , indicate future Veteran clinical population particularly affect AUDs . While FDA-approved medication available treat AUDs , efficacy low compare available psychosocial treatment . Despite lack evidence efficacy control trial , antidepressant frequently prescribe clinical population ( include Veterans ) active AUDs . A well understand patient-level clinical variable may confer poor response treatment antidepressant would allow clinician good tool distinguish alcohol-dependent Veterans likely bad antidepressant treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description Proposed Study A . Scientific Basis : Alcohol abuse dependence represent spectrum maladaptive behavior enormous public health impact , especially U.S . Veteran population . Depressive symptom frequently comorbid alcohol use disorder , despite frequent use serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) clinical practice , clinical trial agent alcohol use disorder yield mixed result concern impact drinking behavior . The characterization alcohol-dependent subject basis demographic variable , severity addiction , psychiatric symptomatology reveal divergence response treatment SSRIs among different subtypes alcoholic ( less severe `` Type A '' vs. severe `` Type B '' alcohol dependence . Type A alcoholic exhibit trend toward decreased drinking behavior clinical trial SSRIs , whereas type B alcoholic show trend opposite direction . The literature offer explanation divergence , therefore , clear research finding apply clinically . As intravenous ( iv ) citalopram infusion ( 40 mg ) bypass hepatic metabolism , single infusion produce clinically relevant concentration human brain , brain concentration remain stable 4 h post-infusion , well-tolerated . A single infusion reduces striatal dopamine receptor bind potential magnitude comparable effect chronic oral citalopram treatment , measure positron emission tomography ( PET ) . The subjective experience crave alcohol alcohol-dependent individual associate decreased dopamine receptor availability striatum via PET . Significance research : Alcohol abuse dependence occur high rate Veterans overall U.S. population , presence comorbid depressive symptom amplify health risk affect Veterans . While FDA-approved medication available treat alcohol dependence , overall efficacy low compare available psychosocial treatment . Given SSRIs frequently utilize Veteran population depressive symptom alcohol use disorder , certainty many Veterans Type B alcohol dependence receive pharmacological intervention may exacerbate drinking behavior , thereby increase morbidity . A good understanding patient-level clinical variable may confer poor response treatment SSRIs would allow clinician good tool distinguish alcohol-dependent Veterans likely worse , prevent intend beneficial medical intervention worsen Veteran 's clinical course . This research well-suited Veteran population high proportion Veterans alcohol dependence . C. Program Objectives : The nominee strong background clinical addiction psychiatry , seek accomplish two objective propose train program : 1 ) become expert field human alcohol addiction research , 2 ) learn technique PET research . The nominee 's work environment West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center ( WLAVA ) , collaboration colleague UCLA provide ideal infrastructure training . He mentor renowned expert area , Drs . Arthur Brody , Edythe London . The mentor several NIH VA grant-funded ongoing study alcohol addictive disorder research strong tie VA PET research infrastructure . As part training , nominee attend several course workshops UCLA foundational neuroimaging topic relevance PET ( statistic , neuroimaging , neuroanatomy ) , well course neurobiological base addiction . He also attend annual conference Alcohol Dependence ( Research Society Alcoholism annual meeting ) neuroimaging ( e.g. , Society Nuclear Medicine annual meeting ) , meet mentor regularly . The nominee plan submit NIH R01 and/or VA Merit Review grant toward end award period . Long term , plan found independent research career study neuropharmacological approach treat understand substance use disorder , focus primarily alcohol . D. Project Design Methods : This project propose study 20 individual 3 group ( Type A alcohol dependence , Type B alcohol dependence , healthy control subject ) double-blinded , placebo-controlled , within-subjects , outpatient study iv citalopram ( 40 mg saline , counter-balanced order ) [ 18F ] fallypride PET scan . Participants good physical health , history complicate alcohol withdrawal symptom ( e.g. , seizure , delirium tremens ) , 21-55 year age , take psychoactive medication . Typology among alcohol-dependent subject assess Kampman et al . ( 2007 ) . The project aim : 1 ) To determine whether iv citalopram ( 40 mg ) affect measure crave alcohol compare blind saline iv control infusion ; 2 ) determine change striatal dopamine receptor D2/3 receptor availability ( measure bind potential radiotracer ) iv citalopram ( 40 mg ) compare iv saline [ 18F ] fallypride PET scanning ; 3 ) ass whether change striatal D2/3 receptor availability iv citalopram ( 40 mg , compare iv saline control ) relate measure crave alcohol among subject . E. Description Intervention ( ) /Treatment ( ) : Through Internet advertising , interested participant invite call phone number anonymous phone screening , individual pass phone screening invite WLAVA screen visit . Potential subject meet criterion alcohol dependence ( via SCID ; except control subject ) , current psychotropic medication use , good physical health ( assessed clinical history physical examination laboratory assay ) , current dependence substance abuse ( SCID ; aside nicotine ) . After screen , qualified participant invite participate structural magnetic resonance imaging ( sMRI scan ) PET scan registration purpose , two day-long experimental session WLAVA , undergo infusion iv citalopram ( 40 mg saline , double blind ) ; least one week separate infusion day allow participant return baseline functioning session . After infusion , participant undergo ~30 min paper- computer-based questionnaire design assess measure mood psychiatric symptom , ~15 min assessment baseline cue-induced craving alcohol . Subsequently , participant undergo [ 18F ] fallypride PET scanning ( ~2h ) ass striatal D2/3 receptor availability . After completion infusion PET scan , participant discharge study . Participants compensate participation accord VA research guideline .</detailed_description>
