	<brief_summary>It apparent local control Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) remain significant problem . Conventional radiation therapy technique limitation dose deliver chest tumor mass due adjacent dose limit organ . Mounting evidence support use hypofractionated stereotactically deliver radiation therapy control lung cancer acceptable toxicity profile . Thus investigator propose increase dos radiation residual mass NSCL BED &gt; 100 Gy addition two fraction stereotactically deliver boost radiation therapy residual disease post-conventional chemoradiation least 59.4 Gy 180 cGy fraction . Using linear quadratic equation model dose radiation therapy , 59.4 Gy would BED approximately 70 Gy . Single fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) 10 Gy would BED approximately 20 Gy . Thus addition two fraction 10Gy SBRT limit volume PET residual disease would theoretically result high degree local control lung cancer mass , achieve minimum cumulative BED approximately 110Gy-equivalent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer represent one challenging malignancy manage . Cure rate marginally improve last 20 year . It commonly fatal cancer men woman overall 5 year survival 15 % . Lung cancer kill Americans next three common malignancy combine . Most non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) present advance stage . Only approximately 25 % present stage I/II disease , 40 % stage III 35 % patient present stage IV . ( 1 ) The optimal treatment stage II/III NSCLC complex . For patient surgical candidate complete resection technically feasible , radical surgery remain standard care . Traditionally , patient multiple N2 nodal level T4 disease consider inoperable . Given average age patient diagnose NSCLC mid-60 's usually long smoke history , many patient medically inoperable .</detailed_description>
