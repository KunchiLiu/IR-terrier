	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate effectiveness feasibility implementation revise standard care oral hygiene ( SAGE Q-care q2 Oral Cleansing Suctioning System without chlorhexidine gluconate ) relative current routine standard care mechanically ventilate patient admit adult Intensive Care Units Alberta Health Services Calgary Zone . This pilot study evaluate feasibility performing large definitive study . The primary assessment effectiveness definitive study proportion patient develop ventilator-associated pneumonia . 150 subject randomly assign use seal opaque envelope one three group ( Oral hygiene provide via current local standard care ; Oral hygiene provide commercial package product ( SAGE Q-care q2 Oral Cleansing Suctioning System ) ; Oral hygiene provide similar commercial package product added chlorhexidine rinse twice daily ( SAGE 24-Hour Suction Systems chlorhexidine gluconate ) . Subjects provide assigned method oral hygiene bedside nurse time ICU admission time ICU discharge . Key measurement include acquisition ventilator-associated pneumonia ; document frequency provision oral care ; state oral hygiene evaluate recorded oral hygiene score ; duration mechanical ventilation ; ICU hospital length stay ; ICU hospital survival ; Antimicrobial utilization ; acquisition antimicrobial resistant microbe . For comparison outcome , mean ( standard deviation ) median ( interquartile range ) report normally distribute skewed variable respectively , compare among three group use ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test , respectively . Only first episode VAP patient evaluate . Given small size pilot study , interim subgroup analysis plan .</detailed_description>
