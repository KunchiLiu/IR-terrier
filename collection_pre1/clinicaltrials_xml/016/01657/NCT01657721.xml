	<brief_summary>The overall objective current study determine whether computerized Working Memory ( WM ) train enhance WM capacity college student Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . There also four additional objective . The first investigate whether program 's efficacy impacted duration daily train session . The second determine whether improvement WM generalize secondary outcome task , inhibitory control planning . The third objective examine whether WM training also ameliorate ADHD symptom inattention hyperactivity . The last objective investigate whether improvement maintain two month follow-up period . The investigator also assess healthy control participant , receive treatment , use basis comparison ADHD participant , It expect computerized WM training program enhance WM capacity college student ADHD . In addition , believe increase WM capacity also lead improvement executive function . It also hypothesize WM train lead reduction ADHD symptomology . Lastly , improvement maintain three month follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Working Memory Training ADHD ( The Engage Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) Learning Disability ( LD ) among common neurobehavioural disorder , prevalence rate estimate 5 % 9 % . Approximately 4 % youth United States comorbid diagnosis ADHD Learning Disability ( ADHD/LD ) . Research show ADHD/LD symptom persist young adulthood , time many enrol post-secondary education . Students ADHD/LD post-secondary education level constitute emergent subgroup ADHD LD population receive far less attention literature compare child , adolescent employ adult . The actual percentage college student ADHD/LD unknown ; however , estimate suggest 2-8 % student attend post secondary education ADHD , LD . Youth additive problem disorder high risk academic failure , poor psychosocial occupational outcome adulthood . The `` multiple deficit model '' suggest common genetic neuropsychological underpinning disorder . For example , ADHD LD share similar feature , core deficit process speed work memory . ADHD LD associate several cognitive difficulty include poor working memory ( WM ) process speed . WM `` mental workspace '' provide temporary storage manipulation information closely related g , propose measure general cognitive ability . In addition , WM also find predict academic achievement . One major problem current intervention approach ADHD/LD target underlie cognitive deficit fundamental diagnosis . Thus , intervention address underlie cognitive difficulty , WM , promise avenue additional treatment youth combine ADHD/LD . WM capacity generally think fix trait , recent study suggest improved intensive adaptive computerized training . This intervention approach evaluate child adolescent ADHD , old adult , adult stroke patient show promising result . Subjects improved trained WM task , study suggest improvement may generalize non-trained WM activity , complex reasoning task , academic functioning , behavioral symptom ADHD work memory failure . Moreover , brain imaging study provide converge evidence training-related improvement work memory : specifically increase activation find cortical region implicate work memory . However , study date investigate whether WM capacity improve population young adult ADHD/LD enrol post-secondary education program . Nor result replicate elaborated upon use different image methodology , like EEG ( Electroencephalography ) , able capture millisecond time parameter cognitive processing may provide new insight neural mechanism WM effect WM training . The overall objective current study determine effectiveness WM training , administer community-based psychologist license provide training , college student ADHD/LD . Specific objectives determine whether ; ) standard-length computerized WM training enhances WM capacity college student ADHD/LD , use behavioral well neuro-imaging index change ; ii ) shortened-length WM training would also result improvement WM ; iii ) WM train normalizes WM performance , compare typically develop peer ( i.e. , healthy comparison group college student ) ; iv ) improvement WM generalize secondary outcome task , inhibitory control planning ; v ) WM training also ameliorate ADHD symptom inattention hyperactivity ; vi ) improvement sustain least month complete training .</detailed_description>
