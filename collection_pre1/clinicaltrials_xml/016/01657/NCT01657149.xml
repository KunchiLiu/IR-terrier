	<brief_title>Influence Manual Lymph Drainage During Hospitalization Swelling , Function Pain Patients After Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past decade rise number knee replacement perform due degenerative arthritis . In general year number operation rise age patient go . The aim operation improve quality life , alleviate pain improve function . Post operative complication delay recovery rehabilitation , lengthen hospitalization duration extreme case lead failure operation . These complication include infection , deep vein thrombosis , swell edema , pain , impairment range motion , muscle weakness functional disability . Reduction post operative edema may help speed recovery total knee replacement . Recently effective treatment find lymphatic edema appear oncological operation include removal lymph node due blood vessel disorder . This treatment administer physiotherapist include lymphatic drainage massage , compression bandaging exercise . This trial examine effect lymphatic massage treatment orthopedic patient ascertain use technique shorten duration improve quality post operative rehabilitation prevent post operative complication . At present time enough research do field necessary continue investigate efficiency lymphatic treatment acute orthopedic patient . Aims To investigate effect lymphatic drainage massage perform immediately total knee replacement relation reduction limb circumference , pain reduction functional improvement . Methods This blind randomize trial take place Sharon hospital Petach Tikvah cooperation orthopedic surgeon . The patient randomize two groups- contain 15 patient . The research group receive lymphatic massage individual physiotherapy control group receive individual physiotherapy . Methods In order ass effect treatment primary measurement circumferential measurement limb volume . The secondary measurement pain assessment accord VAS scale , functional assessment accord BI '' TI range motion measure inclinometer . The measurement take prior hospitalization . During hospitalization measurement take daily include day release home one last measurement take 6 week operation . All measurement valid reliable . The trial schedule last 3-4 month</detailed_description>
