Male subject , surgically sterile , must agree abstinence use double barrier method , , condom plus spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 14 day last dose medication . A female subject eligible participate neither pregnant lactating , fall one follow category : nonchildbearing potential include premenopausal female document ( medical report verification ) hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , postmenopausal female define amenorrheic great 1 year serum estradiol follicle stimulate hormone level consistent menopause , childbearing potential negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( Î²hCG ) test agree comply recognize nonhormonal contraceptive method screen least two week prior first dose ( whichever earlier ) followup visit . Recognized nonhormonal contraceptive method include : complete abstinence intercourse , two form barrier contraception ( e.g . condom spermicide , diaphragm spermicide ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) . History Gilbert 's syndrome . History deep vein thrombosis thromboembolic event . History thrombocytopenia bleed due abnormal platelet number function . Clotting factor abnormality associate hypercoagulability , include Factor V Leiden , Protein C Protein S deficiency antithrombin III deficiency . Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) screening , Day 1 predose ( systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg [ millimeter mercury ] , diastolic &gt; 90 mmHg ) . If subject 's BP elevate first measurement , complete two additional BP measurement least 2 minute apart average three assessment evaluate criterion . If average BP exceed safety criterion , subject exclude . History atrial fibrillation , mitral valve prolapse , significant heart murmur vascular bruit . Prolonged QTcF interval screening , Day 1 predose ( female male &gt; 450 millisecond [ m ] ) . If QTcF interval prolong initial ECG , complete two additional ECGs least 5 minute apart take average QTcF measurement three ECGs evaluate criterion . If average QTcF exceed safety criterion , subject exclude . Female subject currently receive hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . Positive HIV , hepatitis B virus infection HCV infection screen . Positive urine drug screen include serum alcohol screen predose ( Day 1 ) . History alcohol/drug abuse dependence within 12 month study . History alcohol consumption past six month exceed 7 units/week woman 14 units/week men ( 1 unit = 5 ounce wine 12 ounce beer 1.5 ounce hard liquor ) . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoking screen predose ( Day 1 ) . History regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day .
