	<brief_title>Whole-body Diffusion MRI Staging , Response Prediction Detecting Tumor Recurrence Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Staging -- - ( PET- ) CT use nowadays provide image information disease burden ovarian cancer patient diagnostic stag laparoscopy general anesthesia often necessary allow correct accurate staging . The applicant propose `` all-in-one '' image modality provide high quality thoracic-abdominal image without use ionize radiation and/or radioactive material . This allow accurate assessment operability minimally invasive manner . 2 . Early treatment assessment -- - Although response first administration chemotherapy quite reasonable , patient show tumor recurrence achieve increasingly poor response rate second- third-line regime . Therefore major concern individualize prediction chemosensitivity perform avoid unnecessary toxicity inefficient chemotherapeutic agent . A promising perspective predictive data generate might prove sufficiently powerful predict chemosensitivity early course treatment , facilitate timely change treatment nonresponders . This could avoid unnecessary toxicity patient , improve quality life moreover implicate considerable saving healthcare sector . 3 . Identifying tumor recurrence -- - Identifying tumor recurrence early stage could translate reduction unnecessary biopsy , cost saving reduce morbidity associate biopsy procedure . But important issue early diagnosis life save respect tumor recurrence .</detailed_description>
