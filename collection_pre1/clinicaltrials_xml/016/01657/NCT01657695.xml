	<brief_summary>Our long-term objective develop new tool base ( molecular-biology ) integrate image technology able characterize categorize hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient need liver transplant ( LT ) . To end , study aim correlate specific image traits fractional growth individual tumor collect restricted time frame ( T0 week 7 first tumor detection ) , `` molecular signature '' , obtain custom microarray , histochemical cytokine analysis . This allow u translate series purely morphologic information meaningful pathobiologic data set . Validation integrate molecular-imaging tool perform prospectively correlate imaging-molecular data HCC outcome term survival disease-free survival staging procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Organ allocation region regulate accord MELD score . Patients hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) receive additional score depend size tumor time spend transplant wait list . However , advantage give patient uniform take account profound biological heterogeneity individual HCCs . To make additional score righteous , investigator need identify patient aggressively grow HCC require salvage transplantation slow-growing HCC deserve additional score . All cirrhotics suspect HCC identify routine US screen therefore enrol prospective image bio-molecular study . They subject two compute tomography ( CT ) exams 7 week interval define fractional tumor growth image trait , baseline US-guided liver biopsy microarray histochemical characterization , serum sample cytokine assay . Survival , disease-free survival downstaging transplant outcome record analyzed relation image molecular data . The investigator expect set accurate imaging molecular diagnostic tool able identify patient aggressive HCC require urgent access transplant , reliable predict survival , standardisable expensive .</detailed_description>
