	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare evaluate ability two European Union ( EU ) regulate gel foam toothpaste formulation versus non-fluoride toothpaste use modify in-situ model dental erosion remineralization . A positive control i.e fluoride contain toothpaste market EU also compare non-fluoride toothpaste .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study assess remineralization effect two EU gel foam toothpaste formulation 1450 part per million ( ppm ) fluoride sodium fluoride ( NaF ) 5 % potassium nitrate ( KNO3 ) versus non-fluoride ( 0 ppm F ) /KNO3 toothpaste negative control . The two experimental gel foam toothpaste formulation differ relative dentine abrasivity ( RDA ) value in-vitro measure toothpaste abrasivity dentinal tissue . A marketed toothpaste contain NaF KNO3 serve positive control .</detailed_description>
