	<brief_summary>This multi-cohort , dose-escalation study XL888 fix dose vemurafenib . New dose escalation de-escalation cohort assign Principal Investigator ( PI ) discussion appropriate co-investigators safety tolerability know give cohort accordance dose escalation rule . Participants define enrol within cohort upon receipt first dose XL888/vemurafenib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study XL888 With Vemurafenib Patients With Unresectable BRAF Mutated Stage III/IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigational drug XL888 give along drug vemurafenib . The investigator want learn safety side effect XL888 hope find dose drug give safely without serious side effect . Based research do laboratory tissue sample ( cell collect living thing ) , researcher think XL888 might help make vemurafenib work fight cancer cell body longer period time .</detailed_description>
