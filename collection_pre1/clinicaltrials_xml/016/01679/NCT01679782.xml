	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether nervous system alteration motor drive failure contribute muscle weakness COPD voluntary movement . If necessary , look role nocturnal hypoxia alteration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Involvement Nervous System Muscle Weakness COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD common disease induces many systemic repercussion . Among , peripheral muscle dysfunction particularly deleterious lead decrease level activity quality life patient . Movement involve activation many structure , instructor , i.e . brain , effector , i.e . muscle . Netherless , study describe peripheral muscle dysfunction focus muscle , propose reduce vision phenomenon . Other study report cerebral alteration COPD , like cognitive disturbance , increase neuronal conduction time , decrease white matter density , associate chronic hypoxemia . Such alteration consistent existence decrease central motor drive voluntary movement COPD patient . Therefore study aim determine precisely mechanisms involved peripheral muscle dysfunction copd .</detailed_description>
