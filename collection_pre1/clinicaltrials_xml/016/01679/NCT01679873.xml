	<brief_summary>Objective : The aim study assess impact reporting , abstract randomize controlled trial , 1 ) funding source 2 ) conflict interest ( COIs ) author General Practitioners ' confidence abstract ' conclusion . Design : Randomized Controlled Trial 3 arm . Participants : General Practitioners ( GP ) . They recruit among resident Primary Care department Paris Descartes University among GP network agree participate research study . The allocation participant do computerized randomization list , sequence create independent statistician ratio 1 : 1 : 1 . Participants blind hypothesis randomization . Allocation concealment provide statistician access randomization list . Methods : Three intervention assess correspond three different type abstract : 1 ) abstract report neither funding source neither COIs author , 2 ) abstract report funding source 3 ) abstract report funding source COIs author . A sample abstract select publish randomized trial , test superiority , assess pharmacological treatment , field Primary Care General Practice conclusion favor beneficial effect experimental treatment term tolerance / efficacy . They standardize modify obtain three type abstract : 1 ) funding source , 2 ) funding source COIs 3 ) without either source funding COIs . Participants ask assess one abstract randomization arm . Outcome : The primary endpoint GPs ' confidence conclusion . The secondary endpoint quality perception study interpretation benefit experimental treatment . Responses range 10-point numeric scale . Potential interest : This study take place field Primary Care .

	<detailed_description>Dissemination knowledge research result essential step practice Evidence-Based Medicine ( EBM ) ( 1 ) .With grow number publication , lack accessibility , need timely message among information resource large large , General Practitioners ( GP ) often rely abstract publish trial ( 2 ) . Several methodological study show association mode financing , include industry funding , result conclusion publish trial report ( 3-14 ) . To improve transparency , CONSORT recommend report funding source ( 15 ) abstract randomize trial , always follow . Efforts also make report conflict interest author ( COIs ) . In version July 2010 , International Committee Medical Journal Editors Uniform Disclosure Form Potential Conflicts Interest ( ICMJE ) recommend editor ask author submit manuscript , complete ICMJE statement ( 16,17 ) . Despite , understand complexity severity conflict interest yet fully take account guideline ( 18 ) . It demonstrate interpretation result physicians varies mode presentation ( 19-22 ) . The investigator know extent knowledge funding source COIs may influence interpretation finding reader . The investigator therefore interested impact presence element abstract publish trial GPs ' confidence conclusion present . The aim study assess impact reporting , abstract randomize controlled trial , 1 ) funding source 2 ) conflict interest ( COIs ) author General Practitioners ' confidence abstract ' conclusion . STUDY DESIGN The investigator plan 3 arm randomize parallel-group , conduct among GPs resident Primary care plan accord CONSORT 2010 guideline ( 23 ) . For allocation participant , computer-generated list random number use . Randomization sequence create independent statistician R project 1:1:1 ratio use random block size 2 , 4 , 6 . The statistician upload randomization list secure internet system assure allocation concealment . GPs invite e-mail participate study . They log secure internet system randomize GP 3 different arm : 1 ) abstract report neither fund neither COIs , 2 ) abstract report funding source 3 ) abstract funding COIs . Blinding participant possible study . To reduce risk bias , physician inform objective study ( ie study impact presentation funding source COIS ) , existence randomization . They blind work hypothesis study . PARTICIPANTS GPs recruit among network GPs France : network consist GPs agree participate research study . It bring together member Collège Nationale de Généralistes Enseignants ( CNGE ) GPs recruit regional relay represent 10 physician member primary Care department . INTERVENTION Three intervention evaluate correspond 3 different type abstract : 1 ) abstract report source finance COIs , 2 ) abstract report source fund recommend CONSORT abstract 3 ) abstract relate funding source COIs . Abstracts identification : To allow reproducibility generalization result , abstract select randomize control trial ( RCTs ) publish field Primary Care . The investigator choose select abstract RCTs content standardize CONSORT guideline . The investigator also choose retain positive trial ( conclusion favor beneficial effect experimental treatment term tolerance / efficacy ) uniform interpretation result . To identify abstract , investigator search Medline via PubMed indexed abstract use limit randomize controlled trial , English , publish 1srt January 2010 31 December 2010 , Core Clinical Journal . The Core Clinical Journal chosen ensure good quality trial . The investigator restrict search year 2010 ensure physician remember original abstract thus preserve blinding . The eligibility criterion : randomize controlled trial , test superiority , assess pharmaceutical intervention ( drug ) field Primary Care ( i.e . trial assess treatment may prescribe GP , assess treatment prescribed pathology support jointly specialist GP . ) , positive conclusion fund pharmaceutical industry . Exclusion criterion : non-pharmaceutical intervention ( eg medical device , patient education , etc.. ) , equivalence noninferiority trial , safety trial , trial assess different pharmacological procedure , abstract report negative conclusion , report report result ambiguous conclusion ( successful trial relate need study ) , intermediate publication . Construction modify Abstracts : Standardization : All abstract standardize : journal , date registration number ClinicalTrial.gov delete . Authors ' name replace generic name . A list author name determine draw 20 name among 200 name common UK identical abstract . The treatment refer `` experimental treatment A '' `` treatment B '' abstract title . The names study acronym delete . Finally , abstract translate French . Modifications : The three type abstract present follow : 1 . Abstracts report funding COIs If item report original abstract , remove . 2 . Abstracts report funding Funding source search abstract reporting editor full text . If funding source find , abstract wo n't retain . Original funding report name pharmaceutical industry , end abstract , conclusion , head `` FUNDING '' . 3 . Abstracts report funding COIs Funding source report presented previously . COIs search abstract reporting editor full text . If find , abstract wo n't retain . The COIs rank ( 1 ) COIs , ( 2 ) author employ industry ( 3 ) author financial relationship industry . Financial tie regroup together COIs employ : fee , travel cost , return personal institution author work , stock option , link family member employ industry , etc.. For abstract , investigator retain number author conflict . The COIs give modify abstract take initial author type COIs , present two category : `` financial relationship '' `` employee '' head `` CONFLICT OF INTEREST '' . Note investigator consider way `` conflict interest '' author report COIs . We wo n't report abstract . PROCEDURES Participants invite participate study evaluate interpretation abstract RCTs e-mail ( 3 reminder ) investigator national annual medical congress general practice . They inform participation take less 5 minute . After accept , physician complete questionnaire collect characteristic : date birth , sex , status ( resident GP ) . Then randomized start immediately read abstract questionnaire . Participants ask evaluate abstract arm randomization . SAMPLE SIZE The investigator estimate 75 abstract available assess . Three main comparison make : comparison placebo group relate funding source , comparison placebo group relate funding source COIS finally comparison group relate funding source related funding source COIS . With significance level 1.67 % fix three comparison 2-2 ( Bonferonni correction maintain overall significance level 5 % ) , necessary 118 quotation arm demonstrate effect size equal 0.5 numeric scale power 90 % comparison 2-2 . As expected physician read single abstract , necessary include 118 physician per arm ( 354 total , abstract read 4.7 time average ( 4 5 time practice ) ) . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data analysis do software R project , intention treat . A description characteristic physician make initially . Qualitative variable describe number , percentage miss data mode response quantitative variable rate , mean , standard deviation . In case quantitative variable asymmetric behavior , present median interquartile range ( 25th percentile-75th percentile ) . The primary analysis do mean GPs ' confidence 3 possible comparison make . The primary endpoint quantitative , test use comparison 2to 2 non-parametric Mann Whitney 1.7 % threshold . The analysis repeat secondary endpoint quantitative .</detailed_description>
