	<brief_summary>Calcific aortic stenosis ( AS ) become common cardiac disease coronary artery disease hypertension . Unfortunately medical therapy prove decrease either progression valve stenosis result adverse effect myocardial remodel function . In light study perform PROGRESSA , become obvious : ) AS complex actively regulate process involve interaction several pathway include lipid infiltration retention , chronic inflammation , osteogenic activation , active mineralization within valvular tissue ; ii ) AS disease strictly limit aortic valve rather systemic disease often involve calcification stiffen aorta impairment LV function consequence pressure overload . Our finding suggest dysmetabolic milieu link visceral obesity may accelerate deterioration structure function aortic valve also aorta left ventricle . These finding open new avenue research provide strong impetus elaboration prospective study focus `` valvulo-metabolic risk '' AS . The general hypothesis : The metabolic abnormality link visceral obesity accelerate ( 1 ) progression valvular calcification stenosis , aortic calcification stiffness ; ( 2 ) progression myocardial fibrosis dysfunction . The general objective study elucidate mechanism implicate pathogenesis AS identify metabolic factor determine progression : ) aortic valve calcification stenosis ; ii ) myocardial fibrosis dysfunction ; iii ) clinical outcome . This study contribute identify key metabolic determinant AS progression pave way future development non surgical therapy disease . The result study would provide strong support realization randomize trial test efficacy lifestyle modification program new pharmacological treatment aim reduction visceral fat associate metabolic abnormality AS population . Furthermore , study contribute identification novel blood image biomarkers faster disease progression , help optimize risk stratification time AVR AS population .</brief_summary>
