Children chronic condition limit ability measure height weight substantially interfere growth , physical activity , dietary recommendation exclude . Data analysis outcome measure . Intent-to-treat analysis compare study outcome intervention control group post-intervention 6-months follow-up use . To compare difference age-associated increase body mass index ( BMI ) among intervention control group ( Aim 1 ) , mixed effect model group ( child care center ) cluster factor use , recommend several authoritative source . Similar analysis compare difference prevalence overweight ( Aim 2 ) , child 's weight-related behavior ( Aim 3a ) , child 's home environment ( Aim 3b ) , environment child care center ( Aim 3c ) perform .</detailed_description>
