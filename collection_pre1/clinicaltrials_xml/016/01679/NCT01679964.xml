	<detailed_description>A . Objectives To compare treatment-emerged AEs virological suppression switch raltegravir-based therapy stable HIV-infected patient receive ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor antiretroviral regimen Primary endpoint : 1 ) The change overall incidence severity patient-reported clinical adverse event ( base `` symptom distress module ) switch raltegravir-based therapy . Secondary endpoint : 1 . The proportion patient free `` virological failure '' week 48 switch 2 . The change baseline CD4 cell count week 48 switch 3 . The change quality life ass change domain score MOS-HIV questionnaire baseline different study time point . 4 . The change laboratory adverse event , e.g. , mean percent change baseline 48 week plasma lipid profile ( total cholesterol , LDLCholesterol , HDL Cholesterol , triglyceride ) switch 5 . The proportion patient free `` treatment failure '' week 48 switch Safety endpoints 1 . Incidence adverse event 2 . The proportion patient treatment-related grade 3 4 adverse event laboratory abnormality</detailed_description>
