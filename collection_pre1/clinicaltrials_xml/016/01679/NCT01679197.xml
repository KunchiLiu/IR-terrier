	<brief_summary>This study involve research investigational medicine call metreleptin . The reason study find metreleptin improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease associate lipodystrophy , rare disorder associate abnormal loss body 's fat tissue . In study , metreleptin consider investigational treatment lipodystrophy . Metreleptin give via injection skin . We plan continue therapy period one year evaluate change liver disease liver biopsy . We also follow metabolic parameter ( e.g . blood cholesterol , liver function , insulin resistance ) body composition characteristic ( e.g . pattern fat distribution body ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Protocol Investigate Efficacy Recombinant Human Leptin ( Metreleptin ) Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) Associated With Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal test efficacy restorative leptin therapy degree hepatic steatosis amelioration pathological feature NASH/NAFLD . In addition , study evaluate impact leptin therapy total body insulin sensitivity lipid level well energy expenditure . In order accomplish aim , propose efficacy study recombinant human leptin therapy patient form lipodystrophy also NASH/NAFLD . 1 . AIM 1 : To determine efficacy leptin promote amelioration body composition , hepatic steatosis histopathological score patient form lipodystrophy NAFLD/NASH . We conduct 1 year , open-label study , assess metabolic effect recombinant human leptin ( METRELEPTIN , AztraZeneca , Wilmington , DE ) . The primary outcome measure NASH score . We also explore body weight , insulin sensitivity , glucose lipid control , body composition , free fatty acid level . 2 . AIM 2 : To Investigate molecular effect leptin therapy . In parallel preliminary study , gene expression perform individual participate Aim 1 baseline follow 1 year leptin . We combine measure liver metabolite level provide novel insight alteration metabolism occur secondary leptin therapy . We also measure plasma metabolite baseline 2 ( optional ) , 24 48 week therapy assess dynamic change induce leptin correlate change phenotypic measure .</detailed_description>
