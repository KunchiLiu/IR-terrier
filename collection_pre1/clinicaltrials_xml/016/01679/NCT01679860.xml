	<brief_summary>Peripheral T cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) rare hematologic disease . Five-year overall survival ( OS ) PTCL patient ( pt ) range 20 30 % . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-STC ) may curative role pt toxicity high myeloablative conditioning use . Reduced intensity conditioning ( RIC ) decrease transplant relate toxicity mortality . The investigator recently prove feasibility potential efficacy RIC regimen relapse PTCL patient . We want investigate whether possible improve outcome alk negative PTCL pt , stage II-IV diagnosis , intensify therapeutic approach . The intensification obtain combine intensive chemotherapy , alemtuzumab ( anti-CD52 humanise antibody ) auto- allo-SCT pt age 18 60 year ( Clinical Study A ) add alemtuzumab standard chemotherapy ( CHOP ) pts age 61 70 year ( Clinical Study B ) .</brief_summary>
