	<brief_title>Wound Infection Obese Women After Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean section ( CS ) common major operation perform woman world . Approximately one 4 woman United States deliver cesarean section , well establish operative abdominal delivery associate significant risk infection compare vaginal delivery . These risk increase preexist operative site infection , break sterile technique , prolong preoperative admission may result colonization resistant microbe , prolong operative duration , use electrocautery , obesity , advanced age , inadequate host immunocompetence . Obese woman may increase susceptibility infection effect obesity immune system , skin barrier , wound healing , mobility , coexist chronic disease include diabetes , could increase infection risk . Cohort study show woman body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30kg/m^2 two three fold increase risk post cesarean infection , wound infection , urinary tract infection UTI ) , endometritis , pneumonia , compare non-obese woman . Other study find obesity double risk specifically post-cesarean wound infection . Wound complication major source morbidity CS contribute prolong hospital stay rate readmission . Age , ( BMI ) , length incision , time prophylactic antibiotic administration associate post cesarean surgical site infection ( SSI ) . A surgical site infection infection occur surgery part body surgery take place . SSI sometimes superficial infection involve skin . Other surgical site infection serious involve tissue skin , organ , implant material . SSI great impact economy health care resource . Infection always feature modern surgery continue significant problem health care practitioner across world . The ideal skin closure would safe effective , associate minimal patient discomfort , good cosmetic result . It would also inexpensive require few health care resource fast easy apply , require minimal follow-up evaluation , associate low rate complication . Methods close skin time cesarean delivery include stainless steel staple , subcuticular absorbable staple , subcuticular suture , adhesive closure strip , tissue adhesive ( cyanoacrylates ) . Each method postulate benefit wound outcome ; however , none compare prospective trial . The role skin closure suture material wound complication rate Obstetrics poorly study . And talk obese patient find recommendation regard suture material skin closure although Obstetricians use different suture material . Does closure skin absorbable compare non absorbable suture affect rate surgical site infection obese patient undergo caesarian section ? Our hypothesis difference absorbable compare non absorbable suture .</detailed_description>
