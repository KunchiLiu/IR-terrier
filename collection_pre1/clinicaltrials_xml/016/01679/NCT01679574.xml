Written inform consent obtain participant information sheet provide . The patient right refuse participation study withdraw time without deny full regular clinical care . All personal information medical data confidential make available third party . All participant meet Rotterdam consensus criterion diagnosis PCOS . At admission , thorough medical history take woman underwent physical examination , include anthropometric measurement spontaneous menstruation progestin induce withdrawal bleeding , basal endocrine evaluation day 3 cycle include measurement serum concentration luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) prolactin . Then vaginal sonographic examination do measure endometrial thickness exclude case endometrial pathology baseline ovarian cyst . The participant randomize receive letrozole clomiphene citrate plus metformin . Randomization perform use computer-generated random number table , allocation concealment achieve use serially number opaque envelope open intervention assign . In letrozole group , ovary stimulate use 2.5mg/day letrozole ( Femara ; Novartis Pharma , Basel , Switzerland ) 5 day , form one tablet ( 2.5 mg ) per day 5 day day 3 day 7 menstrual cycle ovulation occur pregnancy continue dose another 2 consecutive cycle , ovulation increase dose 2 tablet per day ( 5 mg ) another 2 consecutive cycle manner .

In group , endometrial thickness mean follicular diameter assess investigator use transvaginal ultrasound day 2 ,10 , 12 , 14 menstrual cycle , 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) ( Pregnyl ; Organon , Oss , The Netherlands ) inject intramuscularly least 1 leading follicle measure 18 mm diameter endometrial thickness detect time ( endometrial thickness determine great diameter perpendicular midsagittal plane fundal region , include layer endometrium ) . All participant advise intercourse 24-36 hour hCG injection . Two day give Human chorionic gonadotropin , patient assess sign ovulation ( disappearance preovulatory follicle , fluid cul-de-sac , and/or corpus luteum formation ) . Pregnancy diagnose positive pregnancy test urine do gestational sac detect transvaginal ultrasound examination 1week missed period serum β-hCG concentration 14 day HCG injection menses occur . A biochemical pregnancy consider serum β-hCG concentration 50 mIU/mL absence menstruation . All study medication stop positive pregnancy test.Pregnant patient follow ultrasound could document viability pregnancy . A clinical pregnancy define presence gestational sac beat fetal heart transvaginal ultrasound . A spontaneous abortion define spontaneous loss pregnancy end 20th week .</detailed_description>
