	<brief_title>Cost-minimization Analysis Gastric Cancer Treatments Hong Kong</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The oral chemotherapy agent Xeloda® recently extend Hong Kong Hospital Authority subsidize therapy treatment colorectal cancer1 . Xeloda®-based chemotherapy regimen show cost-effective 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) consider equivalent clinical efficacy colorectal cancer treatment2,3 . The total cost 5-FU-based regimen higher healthcare provider society whole . Gastric cancer rank fourth cancer-related cause death Hong Kong population4 . 5-FU known antitumor activity use successfully advanced gastric cancer ( aGC ) cisplatin ( FP ) , well oxaliplatin ± epirubicin ( FOLFOX4 , EOF ) . When substituted Xeloda® , XP EOX regimens demonstrate noninferior term progression-free survival compare FP EOF , respectively5,6 . In economics evaluation do manufacturer NICE submission use Xeloda® treatment aGC , use XP regimen allow cost reduction eliminate possible complication relate intravenous therapy7 . Moreover , FOLFOX4 , one common 5-FU-based regimen use locally , demonstrate produce median overall survival 10 month advanced/metastatic gastric cancer patients8 . An effect similar EOX . Currently , local data suggest similar economic impact Xeloda®-based regimen gastric cancer compare 5-FU-based regimen . It worthwhile see Xeloda®-based therapy gastric cancer cost-effective alternative . Study Objective To compare retrospective cost treatment Xeloda®-based 5-FU-based regiment patient advance gastric cancer Hong Kong . Methods This retrospective cost-minimization study conduct public hospital Hong Kong . Sixty ( 60 ) gastric cancer patient identify exist case record ( 30 complete Xeloda®-based regimen 30 complete 5-FU-based regimen ) study site . Baseline characteristic group prior chemotherapy , include demographic , ECOG performance score , liver/renal function , metastasis , survival obtain . Cost data also extract patient record . Information collect include cost hospital admission length stay , outpatient visit , diagnostic test treatment , chemotherapy regimen , drug therapy , adverse side effect management , travel , patient time . Baseline characteristic cost compare . Descriptive statistic utilized sensitivity analysis perform investigate robustness cost model .</detailed_description>
