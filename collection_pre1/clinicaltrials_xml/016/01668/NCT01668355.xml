	<brief_title>PACT Individuals With Serious Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : People serious mental illness ( SMI ) die , average , many year prematurely , rate premature mortality 2 3 time great general population . Over 60 % premature deaths population due `` natural cause , '' especially poorly treat cardiovascular , respiratory , infectious disease . Although VA centrally organize , comprehensive healthcare system , Veterans SMI still difficulty navigate system , substantially elevate risk premature death . Too often , attend schedule appointment fail engage primary care treatment , consequently get valuable preventive primary care service . Primary care VA undergone significant transformation Patent Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) model , base Patient Centered Medical Home ( PCMH ) concept . PACT goal improve quality , efficiency , patient-centeredness primary care . But remain unclear PACT impact large population Veterans whose predominant illness treat specialty setting , people SMI . Research inform effort apply PACT model . For example , people SMI poorly usual primary care arrangement , substantial evidence integrate care medical care management approach improve medical treatment outcome , reduce treatment cost , people SMI . Objective : Using available evidence , investigator propose implement evaluate specialize PACT model meet need individual SMI ( `` SMI-PACT '' ) . Methods : This project partner leadership implement SMI-PACT , goal improve healthcare outcome among people SMI , reduce unnecessary use emergency hospital service . Evidence-based quality improvement strategy use reorganize process care . In site-level controlled trial , project evaluate effect , relative usual care , SMI-PACT implementation ( ) provision appropriate preventive medical treatment ; ( b ) patient health-related quality life satisfaction care ; ( c ) medical mental health treatment utilization cost . The project include mixed method formative evaluation usual care SMI-PACT implementation strengthen intervention , assess barrier facilitator implementation . Mixed method also use investigate relationship organizational context , intervention factor , patient provider outcome ; identify patient factor relate successful patient outcome . Significance : This project 's approach SMI-PACT consistent VA PACT model , effort VA improve care Veterans psychiatric disorder . This one first project systematically implement evaluate PCMH PACT concepts patient serious mental illness . Should SMI-PACT demonstrate feasible effective , model could use broadly improve quality efficiency care Veterans .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient subject staff subject currently enrol care one 3 site study . All patient subject Veterans . Patient subject : The investigator enroll random sample 314 patient diagnose schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder bipolar disorder chronic PTSD recurrent major depression psychosis ( 250 intervention , 250 control ) . Staff subject : The investigator enroll approximately 15 staff per site . At site include : 3 member PACT 4 member SMIPACT ( intervention site ) mental health integration ( control site ) 4 provider mental health clinic 2 administrator oversee mental health clinic ( e.g. , psychiatry , psychology , nursing , social work , clerk ) 2 administrator oversee primary care . Patients exclude base comorbid mental medical diagnosis . However , subset individual mental health clinic psychiatrically stable advanced enough recovery require high intensity mental health support make effective use PACT . This assessed baseline patient 's clinician , use Milestones Recovery Scale ( MORS ) scale . This scale rate individual 's ability selfmanage care . Patients rate `` early recovery '' `` advance recovery '' scale remain standard PACT , eligible SMIPACT .</criteria>
