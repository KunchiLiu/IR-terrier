	<brief_title>Treatment Locally Advanced Metastatic Transitional Cell Carcinoma With Cabazitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer 9th common cause cancer worldwide 2002 . About 70 % patient superficial tumour 30 % invasive tumour diagnosis . Patients superficial tumour treat surgery , curative treatment . However , 50 % patient relapse , cure local treatment majority case . The survival untreated metastatic patient exceed 3 6 month , systemic chemotherapy increase overall survival patient unresectable disease . However , overall survival patient advance disease treat chemotherapy remain short ( 14 month ) , reflect substantial unmet medical need effective therapy poor prognosis disease . Cabazitaxel new taxane , taxanes demonstrate activity advanced bladder cancer , among active new cytotoxic agent assess transitional cell carcinoma . Cabazitaxel demonstrate activity cell line acquire resistance doxorubicin , vincristine , vinblastine , paclitaxel , docetaxel . This randomised , open-label , parallel-group phase 2 study cabazitaxel versus best supportive care ( include chemotherapy ) . The study divide three phase : screening , treatment , follow-up . The treatment phase comprise maximum six three-weekly cycle therapy , post treatment discontinuation visit take place 3 week last dose treatment follow-up phase begin . This phase 2 study initially recruit 25 patient interim analysis increase recruit 96 patient randomise two treatment option study expect last 2 year .</detailed_description>
