	<brief_summary>The effectiveness non-pharmacological treatment gait impairment Parkinson Disease ( PD ) exercise demonstrate ; particular example patient tailor exercise physiotherapy . The goal physiotherapy treatment enable PD patient maintain maximum level mobility , activity , independence . Several systematic review clinical study show physical therapy contribute minimize disable effect motor sensory impairment order enhance participation societal role quality life . The use electromechanical device treadmill train ( supplement conventional therapy ) last year also use PD patient systematic Cochrane conduct Mehrholz 2010 ass effectiveness acceptability treadmill train treatment gait disorder patient PD . In last year new robotic assist device use gait train neurological disorder . Till study , focus effect exoskeleton end effector robot-assisted training PD patient , interest preliminary result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim project : 1. verify whether robotics low limb treatment body weight support effective treadmill treatment reduction motor impairment PD PSP patient , improve quality gait endurance ; 2. analyze possible improvement term physiological biomechanical gait analysis kinematics , kinetics EMG evaluation ; 3. analyze possible improvement term reduction instable posture movement , represent reduction risk fall typical subject ; 4. evaluate kinematic , kinetic EMG quantitative data select movement ( gait , posture , ) compare age match reference data ; 5. investigate stability effect robot-assisted treatment 4/6 month follow-up term Quality Life ( QoL ) . A first goal project investigate difference improvement quality safety gait ( motor performance functional recovery ) kinematic/kinetic EMG parameter ( Change Step Length , Change Gait Velocity Change Stride Time Variability , 3D joint kinematics , ground reaction force , joint kinetics , muscle activation , ) traditional clinical scale Parkinson 's patient . The second goal aim identify possible advantage QoL patient undergo kind rehabilitation treatment investigate novel method enable low limb functional recovery , lead wide potential regain personal independence . The third goal analyze direct cost saving associate use technology , measure direct , indirect intangible cost , specific HTA procedure .</detailed_description>
