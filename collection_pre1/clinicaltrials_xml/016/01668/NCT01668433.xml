	<brief_summary>The emergence partial artemisinin resistance Plasmodium falciparum Cambodia-Thai border recently Myanmar-Thai border jeopardizes renew global effort control elimination malaria . Containment severe threat require reduction transmission resistant phenotype add gametocytocidal drug treatment falciparum malaria . Mathematical model also predict transmission blocking require goal malaria elimination achieve . The drug currently available strong gametocytocidal property mature gametocytes primaquine . However , oxidative property primaquine readily cause acute haemolysis glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency , degree appear inversely related G6PD enzyme activity . Because safety concern , primaquine widely deploy treatment regimens falciparum malaria , even area document artemisinin resistance . Methylene blue , exert action oxidative mechanism , promise alternative gametocytocidal adjuvant artemisinin combination therapy ( ACTs ) . Paul Ehrlich discover methylene blue first synthetic drug ever treat malaria . In contrast primaquine , thiazine dye methylene blue assert property oxidize agent high dos , whereas pharmacologic dos reduce agent property reason use medication treatment methemoglobinemia . A recent laboratory study identify methylene blue potent inhibitor gametocyte development across stage , almost fully abolish P. falciparum transmission mosquito concentration readily achievable human . In addition , recent clinical study 180 child uncomplicated falciparum malaria Burkina Faso show , compare artesunate-amodiaquine alone , addition cheap drug methylene blue either artesunate amodiaquine importantly reduce gametocyte carrier rate measure day 3 , 7 , 14 follow-up . This effect see patient without P. falciparum gametocytaemia baseline . The current series study investigate methylene blue potential gametocytocidal drug treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria .</brief_summary>
