	<detailed_description>Premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) , define spontaneous rupture membrane ( ROM ) onset uterine contraction , one common diagnostic dilemma contemporary obstetric practice . Premature rupture membrane occur gestational age , preterm PROM ( PPROM , define PROM 37 week ) responsible 20-40 % preterm birth . Early accurate diagnosis PROM would allow gestational age-specific obstetric intervention design optimize perinatal outcome minimize serious complication cord prolapse , preterm delivery , fetal distress infectious morbidity ( chorioamnionitis , neonatal sepsis ) . Conversely , false-positive diagnosis PROM may lead unnecessary obstetric intervention , include hospitalization , administration antibiotic corticosteroid , even induction labor . Therefore , correct timely diagnosis disorder critical importance clinician PROM PPROM may associate serious maternal neonatal consequence . The diagnosis fetal membrane rupture conventionally make use clinical assessment . First , speculum examination , clinician look amniotic fluid leak cervical o . If clear fluid visualize leak cervical o , diagnosis positive fetal membrane rupture . More commonly , leak absent , extensive workup require , include nitrazine/pH testing , visual inspection pool fluid posterior fornix , microscopic evaluation collect specimen ( ferning ) . Although approach consider standard care , fraught inaccuracy , require intrusive examination may provide rapid diagnosis . Rapid , point care , qualitative immunochromatographic test ( ie. , Amnisure® , ActimProm® , Amnioquick® ) detect proteins find amniotic fluid high concentration , use diagnose rupture membrane ( ROM ) several year . In many hospital , Amnisure® replace sterile speculum exam standard care diagnose ROM . It identify Placental Alpha Microglobulin-1 ( PAMG-1 ) , 34 kd fetal glycoprotein , cervicovaginal secretion . Recently new , rapid , point care , qualitative immunochromatographic test introduce market , ROM Plus® . Unlike immunoassay test , ROM Plus® use unique monoclonal/polyclonal antibody approach detect two different protein find amniotic fluid high concentration . ROM Plus® detect Placental Protein-12 ( also know Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1 ) well Alpha Fetoprotein ( AFP ) . The combination PP12 AFP chosen robust historical literature support ideal protein marker amniotic fluid5-22 , also unique characteristic . PP12 synthesize decidua placenta reach high concentration level amniotic fluid early first trim stay level delivery . However , AFP , synthesize fetal liver yolk sac , reach peak concentration late second trimester/early third trimester . This increase chance protein detect , especially preterm patient , diagnosis ROM crucial . This study design assess performance ( sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV ) ROM Plus® Amnisure® .</detailed_description>
