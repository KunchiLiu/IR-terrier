	<brief_summary>Patients present chest pain investigated test design confirm exclude presence Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) , well determine risk poor outcome . It know image test would best use first investigate patient present exertional chest pain . This trial design compare outcome use coronary CT , stress echocardiography nuclear perfusion ( SPECT ) pilot study . Patients history coronary disease present chest pain randomly assign one three test modality initial image test . The three image strategy compare regard subsequent use healthcare resource year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Patients With Suspected Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) : What Best Initial Imaging Strategy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study image strategy diagnosis coronary artery disease . The pilot trial aim answer question `` Which non-invasive test ( single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , stress echocardiography coronary CT angiography ( CCTA ) ) best first test suspect coronary artery disease respect patient outcome downstream health cost ? '' Patients randomly assign one imaging modality . All image therapeutic procedure trial clinically indicate . The change standard patient management selection initial imaging test . Instead leave selection initial image test refer physician ( whose decision evidence base ) , patient present chest pain fall inclusion/exclusion criterion study randomly assign one image modality . Patients also follow 1 , 6 12 month enrolment determine outcome . The three image strategy compare regard subsequent use healthcare resource year . In large cardiac centre , different image modality perform different specialist therefore operate grant one imaging specialty rarely cover cost image specialty comparative study . To ensure fair comparison modality , modality equal . Previous comparative trial criticize biased towards technique promote principal investigator . This trial unique director nuclear cardiology , coronary compute tomography echocardiography specialist field run state-of-the-art service involve early plan trial involvement ensure trial design meet clinical need . The result trial give insight planning large multicentre , multi-national study .</detailed_description>
