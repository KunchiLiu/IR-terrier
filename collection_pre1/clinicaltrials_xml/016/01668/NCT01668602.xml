	<brief_summary>Stroke number one cause disability . Difficulty walk affect stroke survivor . The focus project understand effect different method ( treadmill walk electrical stimulation ) use improve walk people stroke . In study , patient stroke healthy people stroke test . Study participant take part 18 session walk training . Walking pattern measure use automatic camera standard clinical test . Also , magnetic brain stimulation maybe used measure brain-muscle connection , muscle stimulation may use measure spinal-cord circuit train . This research provide information different factor affect walk stroke change walk training . The investigator hypothesize improvement brain excitability muscle target walk train occur training , change brain excitability related improvement walk pattern . By improve understand walk rehabilitation , study help improve walk function disability people stroke .</brief_summary>
