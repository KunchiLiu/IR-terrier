	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine effect ritonavir efavirenz activity P-glycoprotein human brain . Screening Health self-assessment undergo medical history physical examination , include structure interview screen history medical condition , fast blood glucose HIV blood test , urine HCG pregnancy test woman childbearing potential perform within 24hr study drug administration Study visit Subjects study three occasion , washout session . Sessions 1 : Control ( pretreatment ) - intravenous administration 10 - 14 mCi [ 11C ] desmethyl-loperamide ( dLop ) PET/CT image Session 2 : Pretreatment oral ritonavir 3 day follow intravenous administration 10 - 14 mCi [ 11C ] dLOP PET/CT image Session3 : Pretreatment oral efavirenz 14 day follow intravenous administration 10 - 14 mCi [ 11C ] dLOP PET/CT imaging</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PreStudy Period Subjects potential candidate study educate study procedure , benefit , potential risk . They fill health self-assessment undergo medical history physical examination , include structure interview screen history medical condition . Each subject qualify entry study basis inclusion/exclusion criterion , prestudy evaluation completion inform consent assign next available patient number . This indicate enrollment study . Weight record . All enrolled subject undergo screen fast blood glucose HIV blood test . Subjects exclude fast glucose &gt; 110mg/dl ( ritonavir efavirenz cause glucose intolerance ) HIV seropositive ( since monotherapy cause HIV resistance ) . Blood obtain CYP3A P-gp genotyping . Study Period Subjects study Washington University 's Center Clinical Imaging Research ( CCIR ) follow admission Clinical Research Unit arterial ( blood sample ) peripheral venous catheter ( [ 11C ] dLop injection ) insertion . Each study day consist approximately 4-5 hr stay WU Medical Center scanning , drug dosing , blood sample observation . Female subject childbearing potential ask provide urine sample pregnancy test morning study visit . Subjects standard monitoring scanner . Subjects require refrain : 1 ) alcohol caffeine 24 hr prior study day , 2 ) food/liquids midnight day prior drug administration , 3 ) non-study medication ( include counter and/or herbal ) 3 day prior study visit , without prior approval study doctor . A blood sample obtain isolate DNA determine CYP3A P-gp genotype . Subjects informed result genotype test experimental , conclusive link genotype risk disease adverse event drug therapy . Before study session start , small intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( small plastic tube ) place patient arm hand . This catheter use inject [ 11C ] dLOP . IV fluids give throughout study day . A second catheter insert wrist artery draw periodic blood sample study day . We use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , two sophisticated image technology take picture amount location [ 11C ] dLOP brain three study visit . MRI Scan : The MRI conduct day first PET . The MRI scanner take picture brain . An MRI scanner use simple radio wave create picture . The participant position back scanner bed make feel comfortable possible . The scanner bed move inside large tube participant head chest inside , able see room foot . During scan , participant hear loud , rhythmic knocking sound . Participants ears covered keep noise minimum . It may also possible listen music headphone scan . There speaker microphone scanner participant talk MRI technician something need . Once scan begin , participant need lie still since movement ruin image brain . No intravenous contrast give participant MRI scan . This procedure take 30 minute . PET/CT Scan : The PET/CT scanner use special radiation detection camera produce picture amount [ 11C ] dLOP participant brain use small amount radioactive [ 11C ] dLop . For PET/CT scan , participant ask lie still head padded holder inside scanner . A warm , plastic mask large eyehole place across top participant face . The mask harden cool help participant remember keep head still scanner . The PET scan procedure take approximately two hour start finish include set-up approximately 60 minute scan ) . At 3 study visit [ 11C ] dLop tracer dose 5.8 ug administer intravenously PET scan suite , series PET image take . Blood sample obtain arterial catheter exam evaluate plasma concentration [ 11C ] dLop . Approximately 30 sample collect . Each sample 1ml . The total amount blood collect scan approximately 2 tablespoon . Visit 1 control visit include pretreatment . Patients receive [ 11C ] dLop intravenously , PET/CT scan , MRI blood sample describe . Visit 2 occur 3-30 day Visit 1 . Participants take Ritonavir mouth 2 day PET/CT session list . On study day participant take Ritonavir 400 mg morning scan . Participants receive [ 11c ] dLop , PET/CT scan blood sample describe . Visit 3 occur 2-4 week Visit 2 . Participants take Efavirenz 600 mg mouth every night 14 day prior study day . On study day participant receive [ 11c ] dLop , PET/CT scan blood sample describe . Participants monitor member research team scan .</detailed_description>
