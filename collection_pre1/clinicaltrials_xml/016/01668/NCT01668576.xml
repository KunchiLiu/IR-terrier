	<detailed_description>Problem Interest : Lung transplantation represent potential therapy patient end-stage lung disease pulmonary fibrosis , emphysema cystic fibrosis . The major limitation long term survival lung transplant recipient development graft failure time , term bronchiolitis obliterans . The conventional therapy use prevent rejection effective preventing bronchiolitis obliterans . Therefore , new therapy need address problem . A grow body research focus unique population bone marrow cell term Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) improve range medical condition include heart failure , autoimmune disease , inflammatory bowel disease . MSCs prevent animal model bronchiolitis obliterans . Because information , plausible MSCs could help patient potential treatment lung transplantation . MSCs obtain 2 source : commercially available MSCs generate normal volunteer patient . When MSCs obtain patient use , term `` autologous MSCs '' . A major potential drawback use commercially available MSCs cell contain protein individual could provoke rejection use lung transplant recipient . Therefore , use autologous MSCs currently appear attractive option . What understand present time extent autologous MSCs obtain chronically ill patient end-stage lung disease still maintain property would beneficial . This proposal test immunologic property MSCs generate individual answer question whether generation whether would feasible use cell future prevent entity bronchiolitis obliterans . Overview study : The Investigator approach patient consider lung transplant end stage lung disease . Enrolled patient undergo bone marrow aspiration small amount fluid remove pelvic bone . Cells obtained procedure expand Emory/Georgia Tech Cell Lab . MSCs expand lab use cell culture condition standardly use MSCs . The Investigator test efficiency expansion MSCs determine obtain patient , patient demonstrate inefficient MSC expansion base age disease factor . The Investigator test in-vitro ability MSCs different patient prevent activation immune system face protein individual . The Investigator believe model system approximate type interaction would occur MSCs give patient receive lung transplant . Benefit research knowledge human health : It presently know whether patient severe medical illness able MSCs expand . If find MSCs readily obtain individual additionally find MSCs property would predict beneficial lung transplant , study would provide rationale use MSCs therapeutic agent patient undergo lung transplantation .</detailed_description>
