	<detailed_description>The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial ( ISAT ) turn point modern neurosurgical history ( 1 ) . The trial show 2143 subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) patient eligible surgery endovascular coiling , randomize allocation coil associate well one year clinical outcome , define survival without dependency ( absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) 7.4 % ( 95 % CI ; 3.6 - 11.2 , p=0.0001 ) . Because ISAT positive pragmatic trial , interpretation trial result coil adopted first-line treatment rupture lesion , patient type aneurysm include ISAT , great majority small ( â‰¥10 mm ) anterior circulation aneurysm . Although ISAT well-designed , conduct , report , trial result always properly interpret , endovascular coiling perhaps inappropriately extrapolate beyond ISAT demonstrate . Endovascular treatment rupture aneurysms become first-line treatment many center ( 2 ) , may appropriate small , anterior circulation lesion , evidence support practice wide spectrum non-ISAT patient aneurysm . A recent pre-randomized study coil first-intention ( 3 ) show good result rupture aneurysms felt readily coilable ; however , optimal management difficult-to-coil rupture aneurysms remains unclear . Further compound problem concern aneurysm coil may durable long-term surgical clipping , lead many neurosurgeon continue clip rupture aneurysm spite ISAT result . Proponents endovascular treatment sometimes justify extrapolation ISAT result basis improve catheter coil technology , although never demonstrate . However , addition stent flow-diverters , test ISAT , may increase endovascular treatment risk , especially combine dual anti-platelet agent . The introduction device allow expansion indication EVT include wide-necked aneurysm , lesion would include ISAT . The wider spectrum patient aneurysms consider EVT may experience degree benefit see original ISAT trial ( 4 ) . Considering relatively small ARR 7.4 % favour coiling , additional risk due stent include , balance may tip favour surgical clipping . These new question deserve formal study context randomize clinical trial .</detailed_description>
