	<brief_title>Detection Benign Malignant Thyroid Breast Tumors Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , method diagnosis tumor include palpation , X-ray , ultrasound , CT MRI.The doctor could get conclusion without exist mass.The FNB popular nowadays western country , report one-third malignant case neglect FNB , tissue n't enough needle.There also report increase auxilliary lymphnode metastasis breast cancer FNB.Although Mammotome use widely , still traumatic . Process malignant transformation tissue cell , first protein , lipid , carbohydrate nucleic acid constitute main substance tissue cell structure , conformation , number occurrence significant change subsequent histological change . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy major molecular bond coupling atom vibrational spectra molecular rotational spectrum . In study , consist three phase : Stage one : Continuous enrollment require inpatient surgery 300 case thyroid cancer patient breast cancer patient , 200 case preoperative determination tumor surface infrared spectroscopy , infrared spectroscopy anterior tumor tissue lymph node surgery , measure vivo ; time group 50 patient healthy people , determination surface infrared spectroscopy thyroid breast area . Paraffin pathological finding gold standard , thyroid breast cancer patient divide benign group malignant group , relatively healthy good , distribution difference surface infrared spectrum malignant group , relatively good malignant group IR spectra distribution difference . Phase II : Were enrol , infrared spectroscopy pathological specimen collect different stage . Paraffin pathological finding gold standard , establish two tumor surface , infrared spectra fresh vitro vivo tumor benign malignant diagnosis discrimination system . Phase III : Into infrared spectra collect data behalf above-mentioned discrimination system verify sensitivity , specificity accuracy ; paraffin pathological finding gold standard compare infrared spectral discrimination system intraoperative frozen section pathology diagnosis benign malignant tumor correctly rate difference , explore clinical value infrared spectroscopy discrimination system .</detailed_description>
