	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose oral Src/Abl inhibitor AZD0424 , find tolerable effective AZD0424 combination regimens treatment advance solid tumour</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study AZD0424 Alone Combination Advanced Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZD0424 potent orally available , potent ( IC50 approximately 4 nM ) inhibitor Src ABL1 kinases additional activity Src family kinase ( SFK ) member include Yes Lck . AZD0424 selective SFKs ABL1 kinase C-terminal Src kinase ( negative regulator Src ) range kinase target . The anti-cancer activity AZD0424 think mediate primarily anti-migratory anti-invasive signalling , , expect late stage cancer set strong signal efficacy compound use single agent unlikely , require administer combination anti-cancer agent . In summary study perform four main stage : - AZD0424 monotherapy , dose escalation : Phase Ia single agent ( AZD0424 ) dose escalation study determine MTD . - AZD0424 monotherapy , dose expansion : Phase Ib single agent dose expansion MTD ( six additional patient may recruit order provide pair tumour biopsy PD analysis ) . - Combination arm dose escalation : Provided deemed appropriate ( review available clinical data monotherapy part trial , available preclinical publish data combination ) , Phase Ia dose escalation arm AZD0424 combination select agent proceed determine MTD combination recommend Phase II dose . - Combination arm dose expansion : Phase Ib combination arm use recommend Phase II dose AZD0424 combination agent .</detailed_description>

Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator DDO exclude patient . Symptomatic brain metastasis ( brain metastasis present must stable &gt; 3 month ) . Patients evidence interstitial lung disease ( bilateral , diffuse , parenchymal lung disease ) . Patients peanut allergy exclude . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrollment agree use two highly effective form contraception detail protocol consider eligible . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception detail protocol ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Resting ECG measurable QTc interval &gt; 480 msec ( mean value manually verify ) least 3 time point within 24 hour period . Concurrent hypotension define baseline supine blood pressure ( BP ) systolic &lt; 90 mmHg . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] ) , prior history cardiac ischaemia prior history cardiac arrhythmia within 6 month . Coronary angioplasty stenting previous 12 month . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase Ia/Ib study AZD0424 single agent combination . Participation observational , counsel psychological trial would acceptable . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
