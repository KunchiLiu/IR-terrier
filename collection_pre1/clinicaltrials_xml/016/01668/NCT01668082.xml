	<brief_summary>The study design use infusion non-radioactive , naturally occur isotope glucose ( 13C ) patient undergo surgical resection newly identify brain mass obtain metabolic phenotype tumor , correlate histopathological diagnosis . In patient , 13C NMR spectral analysis tumor extract obtain intraoperative infusion [ U-13C ] glucose [ 1,2-13C ] glucose . Whenever feasible , patient undergo 3 preoperative image study - 18FDG-PET , diffusion tensor image 1H-spectroscopy 3T MR scanner , ultra high resolution MR image 7T MR scanner . The result image study correlate metabolic phenotype generate comprehensive non-invasive view tumor goal identify infiltrative , metabolically active tumor cell within brain . In addition , comprehensive molecular profile tumor obtain enable genotype-metabolic phenotype comparative analysis . Correlative Translational Research The investigator obtain tumor tissue patient comprehensive molecular analysis ( array CGH , expression profiling , methylation profile ) correlate tumor histology , metabolite identify 1H-MR spectroscopy 13Cglucose metabolic profile . Patients follow designated time point along treatment course obtain information ongoing treatment response , time tumor progression overall survival . These parameter use correlational analysis metabolic phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study expand include subject primary tumor outside central nervous system , include breast cancer , lung cancer , melanoma , renal cell carcinoma , prostate cancer colon cancer . Patients brain mass identify brain image need surgical resection mass eligible metabolism study . Eligible study patient screen , recruit , enrol UT Southwestern Medical Center Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center , University Hospital - Zale Lipshy University Hospital - St. Paul , Children 's Medical Center Dallas well Parkland Health Hospital System . We consent 60 patient , include project screen failure early withdrawal , anticipate study 25 patient clinical protocol . Once enrolled , patient undergo series preoperative brain image study include 3T MRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) 1H-MR spectroscopy , 7T MRI brain 18FDG-PET scan within 7-14 day schedule operation . Of study , 3T MRI standard care . The DTI 1H-MR spectroscopy additional scanning sequence do research purpose . Similarly , 7T MRI 18FDG-PET do research purpose . On day surgery , patient peripheral IV start wait preoperative hold area 20 % solution either [ U-13C ] glucose and/or [ 1,2-13C ] acetate ( determine individual patient PI ) infuse rate 4g/hr maximum 4 hour . During infusion period , 4 time blood sample collect NMR analysis 13C-glucose blood . The infusion continue tumor resect sample collect flash frozen 13C-NMR spectral analysis molecular analysis . The infusion tumor collection 13C-NMR analysis do research purpose . However , remainder neurosurgical operative post-operative procedure follow accord standard practice . The patient see 10-14 day surgery follow visit time assessment adverse event perform . Thereafter , every 6 month 5 year death , patient contact data regard treatment , response , tumor progression collect correlative analysis .</detailed_description>
