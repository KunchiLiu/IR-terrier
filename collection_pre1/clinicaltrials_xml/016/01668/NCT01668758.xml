	<brief_summary>Background : - The amount blood flow brain area go area use activity , movement seeing . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) common way measure blood flow brain . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) also use study blood flow brain . However , NIRS use often fMRI . Researchers want compare fMRI NIRS see whether give similar result . These study use look people traumatic brain injury . Objectives : - To test well NIRS measure change blood flow brain traumatic brain injury . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 60 year age traumatic brain injury . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Researchers may ask see brain image previous MRI scan . - Participants NIRS scan brain . They ask certain task inside scanner . These task involve respond image appear screen . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study able assess frontal lobe function rapid , objective , standardized way , without need expertise cognitive test administration . Such method would particularly helpful mild traumatic brain injury , objective measure need , would greatly expand capacity make assessment standard clinical practice . Our goal recruit 100 subject total two group age , gender , education match subject , follow : TBI ( n = 50 ) non-TBI ( n = 50 ) . The subject ask perform 2 computer-based cognitive test fNIRS device place . The fNIRS sensor pad record change blood oxy/deoxy hemoglobin concentration underlie cortex . Data store post processing analysis . The main outcome measure : 1 ) correlation fNIRS result TBI non-TBI group ; 2 ) correlation fNIRS result severity TBI within TBI group . Finally , plan compare individual measurement TBI patient healthy group .</detailed_description>
