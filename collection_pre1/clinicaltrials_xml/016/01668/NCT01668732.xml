Since introduction opioids substitutive treatment 2006 , 30,000 heroin addict receive treatment , nearly 12,000 continued treatment currently . However , unknown proportion patient hide community remain un-treatment . To motivate community heroin addict thus challenging task . It suggest decision make deficit core feature determine outcomes treatment motivation patient addiction disorder . Recently , state-of-the-art development epigenetics uncover environmental modification , via alter level DNA methylation gene expression influence neurocognitive functioning . Via respondent-driven sampling , study aim recruit representative sample target hard-to-reach community heroin addict . The goal study identify clinical feature well decision making-related neurocognitive deficit patient . Moreover , investigator explore interplay clinical feature , DNA methylation gene expression opioids receptor gene . The finding help clarify clinical characteristic community heroin addict , uncover link DNA methylation clinical feature heroin addiction develop modifiable treatment target future .</brief_summary>
