	<brief_summary>Forty percent patient admit contribute regional burn unit five month period receive facial burn ( n=14 ) . The purpose study examine time granulation bed well establish decrease use enzymatic agent , compare second standard ointment , patient partial-thickness facial burn . The current study use prospective , experimental study design individual match control . That , individual receive experimental ointment ( one-side face ) standard ointment ( other-side face ) . Outcomes measured benefit ( e.g. , decreased time granulation bed establishment ) one ointment achieve partial-thickness facial burn compare second ointment . Exploratory analysis examine relationship among demographic variable , granulation bed establishment time , pain , anxiety , itch , scar . That , test whether time granulation establishment may associate individual 's demographic variable , treatment type , pain , anxiety , itching level , scar . Significance analysis 0.05 level . The investigator hypothesize promote rapid granulation bed establishment decrease hospital length stay , cost , risk infection , possibly associate appearance change . The result current study provide preliminary finding future , sophisticated study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Wound Bed Establishment Facial Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid wind heal burn injury advance wound closure , decrease opportunity infection scarring ( Hansbrough , Achauer , Dawson , et al. , 1995 ; Soroff &amp; Sasvary , 1994 ) ; also lead short length stay ( LOS ) . Decreased LOS hospital support rapid wound closure facilitates reentry home work environment lead reduction cost associate hospitalization . In addition , patient facial burn , rapid granulation bed establishment may decrease associate appearance change . Use enzymatic agent describe three study ( Hansbrough , Achauer , Dawson , et al. , 1995 ; Soroff &amp; Sasvary , 1994 ; Varma , Bugatch , &amp; German 1973 ) . Treatment enzymatic agent result short time achieve clean wound bed significantly rapid wound heal compare control agent 94 patient non-facial , partial-thickness burn ( Hansbrough , Achauer , Dawson , et al . ; Soroff &amp; Sasvary ) . Twenty patient dermal ulcer treat enzmatic agent , compare placebo control , show significantly decrease pu , odor , necrosis , inflammation ( Varma , Bugatch , &amp; German , 1973 ) . There relative reduction wound size almost reach significance ( p &lt; 0.07 ) patient dermal ulcer . Though enzymatic agent without purport antibiotic property , rapid reduction bacterial burden wound show animal model ( Payne , Salas , Ko , Naidu , Donate , Wright et al. , 2008 ) . The bacterial burden decrease rapidly scald burn wound achieve bacterial balance 15 rat E-coli infect wound compare saline-treated control &lt; 105 colony form units/gram tissue ( p &lt; .05 ) . Previous study suggest exploratory variable collect associated shorter heal time low infection rate . Whether difference actually due mediating/moderating factor ( gender-specific enzyme hormone concentration , gene interaction , metabolism , etc ) exploratory variable unclear empirically establish . A future , large study hopefully fully explore relationship . However , justify detailed investigation require show difference crude level . Unfortunately , date research examine potential benefit use collagenase patient facial burn injury . As result , aim study : 1 . Show benefit ( e.g. , decreased time granulation bed well establish , short time wound closure ) enzymatic agent achieve partial-thickness facial burn compare common antibacterial agent ; 2 . Investigate interrelationship among demographic variable , treatment , pain , anxiety , itch ; 3 . Explore whether time granulation bed establishment predicted treatment ; adjust demographic variable , pain , anxiety , itch level . 4 . Examine long-term scar social experience person facial burn . Design : A prospective , experimental study design individual match control . Methods Procedure . Within 24 hour burn unit admission , patient spouse , guardian ask regard study participation . Upon patient agreement , sign institutional review board approve informed consent form , HIPAA Research Authorization , demographic information form complete wound culture result obtain ( order ) . The patient randomize receive either bacitracin collagenase right side face ( ointment one ) . Ointment two applied leave side face . Treatment partial-thickness facial burn perform nurse burn unit accord burn unit protocol . Therefore , person serve match control , thus reduce sample size require achieve sufficient power study reduce deviance case control ( i.e. , age , pain , itch , size burn , scar ) . Also , type study design allow u achieve valid , reliable result few individual . This typical study design similar ointment eye drops study . The bridge nose use guide divide face half lengthwise . The wound cleanse dressed twice daily . Treatment continue granulation bed well establish . Daily rating pain , anxiety , itch obtain morning dress change . Digital photographs facial burn take weekly first outpatient visit . Patient confidentiality maintain assign participant random , unique , study identification number link directly individual . This random number use study data set data management data analysis . Signed ( approve ) inform consent form keep locked file principle investigator 's office . The research data set store university secure computer drive . Digital photograph identify patient number . These photograph rat burn wound expert recruit post American Burn Association web site ( e.g . nurse and/or physical therapist certify wound care minimum 5 year ' experience ) . Patients ' record also assess weekly whether patient study wind blood infection confirm positive laboratory culture . Those patient confirm positive culture drop study . Patient pain , anxiety , itch scoring obtain record nurse care patient burn unit . Assessment scar obtain first out-patient visit healthcare provider patient . For three six month follow-up , every effort make health care provider patient assessment , however , may always possible patient return hospital ( e.g. , cost associate travel miss work ) patient 's assessment obtain via telephone . Assessment social experience obtain complete two instrument open-ended question either in-person telephone interview first out-patient visit , three six month injury . Instrumentation Pain Anxiety . Physician order analgesic anxiety therapy provide per patient request prior dress change . At morning dress change , patient rate perception pain anxiety , separately , 10-point visual analogue scale ( 1= pain , anxiety 10= possible ) three time point . These time : prior cleanse debridement , completion dress change , 30 minute treatment . The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) use non-verbal patient . Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) . Inter-rater reliability 290-paired observation nurse , result RASS demonstrate excellent inter-rater reliability ( weighted kappa , 0.91 0.94 , respectively ) ( Ely , Truman , Shintani , et al. , 2003 ) . Criterion validity test 411-paired observation first 96 patient validation cohort , RAS show significant difference level consciousness ( P &lt; .001 ) correctly identify fluctuation within patient time ( P &lt; .001 ) . Face validity demonstrate via survey 26 critical care nurse , result show 92 % agree strongly agree RASS score scheme , 81 % agree strongly agree instrument provide consensus goal-directed delivery medication . Itch . Physician order itch therapy ( e.g. , Benadryl , Atarax , Claritin ) provide per patient request prior dress change . At morning dress change , patient rate perception itch 10-point visual analogue scale ( 1=no itch 10=the possible ) , three time point . These time : prior cleanse debridement , completion dress change , 30 minute treatment . Scarring . Scarring measure two instrument [ The Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) ] develop Draaijers , Tempelman , Botman , et al . ( 2004 ) test Van de kar , Corion , Smeulders , et al . ( 2005 . These two instrument , one health care provider second patient , recognize need professional 's patient-based need scar assessment , whereas , Vancouver Scar Scale ( VSS ) assess scar severity professional 's viewpoint . Though VSS accept used scar assessment tool , evidence suggest `` gold standard '' measure burn scarring , additionally , include patient 's perception scarring . The POSAS item assess vascularity , pigmentation , thickness , relief pliability , rat 10-point numeric scale , normal skin bad scar use end label . Items patient scale directly correspond thesis except scar color . Patients ask rate itchiness scar pain . A ten-point numeric scale use ( 1=no complaint /normal skin , 10=worst imaginable/very different ) . Individual item sum high score represent poorer scar low score represent scar closely normal skin . Both scale show acceptable internal consistency ( Cronbach 's alpha 0.76 ( patient ) 0.69 ( observer ) . The test-retest reliability patient scale evaluate burn scar . Social Experience . It propose partial-thickness burn side face result non-normal appearance may cause stigmatize dehumanize behavior direct burn survivor ( Lawrence , Fauerbach , Heinberg , Doctor , Thombs , 2006 ; Lawrence , Rosenberg , Rimmer , Tombs , Fauerbach , 2010 ) . The following two instrument assess social experience . The social experience measure two instrument : Perceived Stigmatization Questionnaire ( PSQ ) Social Comfort Questionnaire ( SCQ ) ( Lawrence , Fauerbach , Heinberg , Doctor , Thombs , 2006 ; Lawrence , Rosenberg , Rimmer , Tombs , Fauerbach , 2010 ) . Both instrument develop test use population burn injury survivor . The PQS 21 item scale item measure 5-point Likert scale ( never , almost never , sometimes , often , always ) . Three factor load : absence friendly behavior , confuse behavior starring , hostile behavior . Scores calculate total item divide 21 . Higher score indicate level perceive stigmatizing behavior . The SCQ eight item , one factor scale . Each item also measure 5-point Likert scale ( never , almost never , sometimes , often , always ) . The final score average item ; high score indicate high social comfort . Open-ended Questions : Several open-ended question include allow participant describe instance social experience change facial burn injury . It hop answer clarify two instrument finding</detailed_description>
