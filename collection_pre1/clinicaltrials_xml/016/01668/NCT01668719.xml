	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose elotuzumab see well work give together lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma likely recur ( come back ) , spread ( high-risk ) . Lenalidomide bortezomib may stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow tumor . Also , bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , also work different way kill cancer cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving elotuzumab together lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone may better way block cancer growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1211 Bortezomib , Dexamethasone , Lenalidomide With Without Elotuzumab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine appropriate Phase II dose elotuzumab use combination lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To assess whether incorporation novel agent elotuzumab treatment algorithm high-risk multiple myeloma ( HRMM ) improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Phase II ) III . To estimate frequency severity toxicity treatment strategy patient population . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study elotuzumab , follow phase II , randomize study . PHASE I : INDUCTION : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 ; lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 ; dexamethasone PO IV day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 ( day 15 course 1 2 ) . Patients also receive elotuzumab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 2 day 1 11 course 3-8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive bortezomib SC IV day 1 , 8 , 15 ; lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 ; elotuzumab IV day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION : Patients receive bortezomib SC IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 ; lenalidomide PO QD day 1-14 ; dexamethasone PO IV day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient receive course chemotherapy prior registration begin protocol treatment course 2 receive total 7 course protocol therapy ) . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive bortezomib SC IV day 1 , 8 , 15 ; lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : INDUCTION : Patients receive bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone Arm I . Patients also receive elotuzumab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 2 day 1 11 course 3-8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone Arm I . Patients also receive elotuzumab IV day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 year .</detailed_description>
