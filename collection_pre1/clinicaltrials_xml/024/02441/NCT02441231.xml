	<brief_summary>Modern antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) transform clinical care live experience HIV infection . However , increase rate adverse health condition relate immune activation , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) neurodegenerative disease ART-treated individual persist . An important cause inflammation gut CD4 T cell loss `` leaking '' translocation luminal gut bacteria microbes across bowel wall bloodstream . The use complementary alternative therapy common among people live HIV , estimate range 16-60 % . However , efficacy generally well demonstrate . Probiotics live microbe may provide health benefit host investigator believe simultaneous use probiotic along ART improve gut CD4 T cell restoration function therefore reduce microbial translocation immune activation . A major challenge HIV treatment suboptimal CD4 T cell count despite successful HIV suppression ART immunologic non-responders ( INRs ) . These individual increase risk AIDS-related death non-AIDS related comorbidities may associate increase immune activation microbial translocation gut mucosa . With limited treatment option , alternative therapy reduce inflammation restore gut immunology important . Probiotic Visbiome consist high potency blend eight different probiotic . The precise mechanism action Visbiome unknown , preclinical study show Visbiome may modulate immune response towards immunoregualtory phenotype increase level IL-10 reduce level proinflammatory cytokine ( TNFα , IL1β IL-8 ) . Therefore , investigator believe `` beneficial '' bacteria Visbiome accelerate normalization gut immune cell function HIV-infected INRs . It hypothesize consumption Visbiome 48 week help restore immune system INRs suboptimal immune reconstitution currently available ART . Resolution gut immune cell mean microbial translocation immune activation normalize reduce rate HIV-associated comorbidities .</brief_summary>
