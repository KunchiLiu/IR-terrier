	<brief_title>Timing Rectal Cancer Resection After Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main question study whether delay surgery preoperative CRT increase disease-free survival . The standard 6-7 week wait period compare 10-11 week , time-frame identify Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit increase likelihood pCR . This trial also able determine increase wait interval increase rate sphincter-preservation , local recurrence , pCR . While similar GRECCAR-6 trial , primary outcome disease-free survival ( clinically relevant outcome ) first North American clinical trial nature . To maximize utility trial , immunohistochemical staining perform pre-CRT tumor sample prospectively validate score system propose Hur et al . [ 28 ] The question whether expression biomarkers predict patient experience pCR disease-free survival . The pilot construct prospective , open-label clinical trial , patient randomize undergo surgery 6-7 week 10-11 week completion preoperative CRT . The intention preliminary data available , centre Ontario recruit . This help answer research question , also create large , prospective database rectal cancer patient . The Primary outcome ( disease-free survival ) assess 3 year .</detailed_description>
