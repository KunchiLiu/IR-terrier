	<brief_summary>Primary orthostatic tremor ( POT ) rare progressive functionally disable tremor disorder . The characteristic feature POT symptom unsteadiness legs report patient stand improvement symptom upon walk sit . Due limit success treatment option clear merit continue effort explore investigate novel treatment modality . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) well-established physiological tool understand brain function . When repetitious TMS pulse deliver specific target predefined stimulation parameter , refer rTMS therapy.The investigator propose novel approach investigate clinical physiological effect low frequency rTMS therapy POT . The overarch hypothesis study low frequency rTMS therapy deliver cerebellum modulate cerebellar excitability result clinical improvements.In order determine physiological effect relate rTMS , tremor physiology also record surface electromyography ( EMG ) . The investigator also record change cerebellum excitability response rTMS use cerebello-cortical inhibition ( CBI ) , well-established TMS parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>POT tremor record surface electromyography ( EMG ) reveal distinct high frequency burst 13-18 Hz tremor leg muscle . POT first describe 1984 University Florida . Since several clinical description publish however despite knowledge thirty year , treatment opportunity POT remain poor . Several medication try , result disappoint . Thalamic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery , invasive therapy approve FDA treatment essential tremor , recently investigate POT early result partially successful . In clinical description , POT observe associated clinical feature cerebellar dysfunction dysmetria gait ataxia . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image show increased activation bilateral cerebellum relate either mismatch peripheral afferent cerebellar efferent traffic primary disorder cerebellum . MRI study confirm cerebellar atrophy POT finally transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , show POT reset stimulation cerebellum . The primary goal study test efficacy low frequency rTMS therapy POT . The first aim study determine clinical impact 1-Hz rTMS therapy POT deliver cerebellum . This impact evaluate clinical scoring leg tremor stand posture , functional assessment gait mobility . The second aim study determine physiological effect 1-Hz rTMS therapy POT deliver cerebellum . The investigator determine effect amplitude frequency tremor record surface EMG . They also determine effect cerebello-cortical inhibition measure TMS . Comparisons drawn rTMS therapy , immediately +5 minute 60+ minute assessment determine time course effect . In application , subject POT enrol base clinical history , physical exam 13-18 Hz tremor record surface EMG accordance Consensus Statement Movement Disorder Society . Data present mean ( SD ) unless otherwise indicate . For outcome variable , statistical analyst conduct mixed model analysis use time stimulation arm repeat factor adjust baseline value , subject random factor .</detailed_description>
