	<brief_summary>In metastasize locally advanced breast cancer patient , local problem often occur like skin metastasis , ulceration lymph node metastasis . These problem relate bad quality life , overall survival generally order month year . Treatment lesion challenge , especially failure first second line systemic therapy . Local treatment , like radiation , able give short-term palliation , effect often disappointing long run . Therefore , search new therapeutic strategy like combination local systemic treatment emerge . Recent investigation clearly show radiation capable induce systemic anti-tumor response . Both mouse model patient , report irradiate one metastasis slow growth non-irradiated metastasis . This effect call `` abscopal effect '' immune-mediated . There also several chemotherapeutics capable influence immune response like cyclophosphamide . Cyclophosphamide known inducer immunogenic cell death , lead activation dendritic cell thus presentation antigen . In pilot study investigator wish identify immunological effect combine treatment radiation cyclophosphamide breast cancer patient . Five patient metastasize breast carcinoma treat combined treatment immunological effect monitor use repeat blood draw biopsy . These effect correlate clinical response .</brief_summary>
