	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : The purpose study investigate whether High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT ) improve health wellbeing pre-diabetic elderly adult . In particular , specific interest describing effect interval exercise program inflammatory state immune function . DESIGN : Subjects sedentary , 65 80 year old adult , prediabetes define fast plasma glucose ( 100 125 mg/dl ) . Before 10-12 week High Intensity Interval Exercise train program subject undergo several test include : 1 ) maximal treadmill test , 2 ) Oral Glucose Tolerance Test , 3 ) muscle biopsy , 4 ) body composition , 5 ) several physical function test 6 ) health related measure include lung function , arterial stiffness several blood measure ( e.g . liver enzymes , kidney function ) . DATA ANALYSES &amp; SAFETY ISSUES : As comparison group , data analysis consist perform pair t-tests pre post exercise training value measurement variable interest . In addition , data use provide power calculation future grant proposal . High Intensity Interval Training safe exercise modality . The regular use vigorous intensity exercise interval use extensively exercise training . In fact , exercise interval start level low short duration use maximal exercise test . They carefully slowly make challenge subject able safely tolerate . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator hypothesize HIIT result significant improvement marker inflammation , immune system marker health-related risk factor .</brief_summary>
