	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer second lead cause cancer relate death United States . Colonoscopy commonly perform screening procedure diminutive polyp ( &lt; 5mm ) commonly find polyp colonoscopy . Although polyps low risk harboring malignancy , routinely remove determine surveillance interval . Narrow Band Imaging equip widely available colonoscope expert hand allow accurate real-time optical histologic diagnosis colorectal polyp . If practice apply widely , significant potential cost saving . This lead 'characterize , resect discard ' strategy polyp determine hyperplastic ( benign neoplastic potential ) leave place determine adenomatous ( neoplastic potential ) resect discard . It unclear endoscopists without prior expertise training Narrow Band Imaging achieve adequate diagnostic accuracy put 'characterize , resect discard ' wide practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroenterologists without prior train NBI two affiliate academic hospital participate ex-vivo training session view short audiovisual tool describe previously validate NBI criterion determine polyp histology , follow review 80 video diminutive polyp NBI record predict polyp histology degree confidence . After video , target feedback regard actual polyp histology NBI criterion support diagnosis provide . Participants employ NBI real-time colonoscopy ( in-vivo ) record predict polyp histology , degree confidence predict surveillance interval base NBI interpretation . Each study polyp send histology separately . Performance assess compare predicted histology actual histology . Structured performance feedback give promote practice-based learning , establish real-time learning curve determine number observation require achieve competency in-vivo . The primary aim study determine whether endoscopists prior experience train Narrow Band Imaging achieve threshold set forth American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy : For diminutive colorectal polyp diagnosis make 'high-confidence , ' ( 1 ) great equal 90 % negative predictive value rectosigmoid colon ( 2 ) great equal 90 % agreement surveillance interval predict narrow band image base current gold standard histology . The secondary outcome in-vivo phase include ( 1 ) evaluate overall group performance ( accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , predictive value ) optical diagnosis use NBI base degree confidence location within colon , ( 2 ) evaluate individual performance ASGE benchmark , ( 3 ) determine predictor performance , ( 4 ) determine real-time learning effect set ongoing , structure performance feedback . The secondary outcome ex-vivo ( train ) phase include ( 1 ) evaluate overall performance degree confidence , ( 2 ) determine predictor performance training ( 3 ) evaluate learn effect set ongoing feedback training . Sample size calculate show NPV 90 % high assume true NPV 95 % rectosigmoid polyp characterize `` high-confidence , '' base 26 participate endoscopists within-endoscopist correlation 0.05 . This require 336 total rectosigmoid non-adenoma polyp characterize `` high-confidence , '' assume approximately 22 % rectosigmoid polyp , 70 % high confidence 80 % hyperplastic , study require approximately 2,727 polyp 1,364 colonoscopy total , assume approximately two polyp per colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
