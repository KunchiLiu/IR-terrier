	<brief_summary>Fractures fifth metacarpal neck common injury involve upper extremity . Patients typically young adult male . Restoring function quickly reliably return work and/or activity important ; patient significant labour force demographic . Treatment historically splint approximately 3-4 week . Splinting fracture `` trade-off '' . Immobilization allow stabilization fracture healing , also cause hand stiffness weakness lead impaired function . Little prospective research exist ; agreement ideal duration splint therapy , demonstrate clinical equipoise . A new concept hand rehabilitation `` early active range motion '' ( EAROM ) . The objective trial establish EAROM provide improve early ( 6 week ) hand function compare standard immobilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fractures fifth metacarpal neck ( `` boxer 's fracture '' ) , common injury upper extremity . They result axial force flexed metacarpalphalangeal ( MCP ) joint . Typically , cause strike hard object close fist , break knuckle `` little '' finger . Restoring hand function quickly reliably return work and/or activity utmost importance . These patient significant labour force demographic . Since injury characteristically sustained work , `` return-to-work '' important patient consideration lose wage . Treatment fracture fifth metacarpal neck typically non-operative . In absence urgent operative indication ( ie . `` open fracture '' contamination ) , non-operative management initiate . Closed reduction perform local anaesthesia manual manipulation . A splint apply . Repeat x-rays obtain determine positioning . If anatomic alignment stable , surgery indicate patient remains splint 3-4 week . `` Early active range motion '' ( EAROM ) refers actively move fracture digit fracture callus begin formation 3 day . In practice , EAROM begin 3-14 days.It involve control , active tendon glide exercise patient attempt move joint injured hand . This motion perpendicular fracture pattern , apply compressive force fracture . From basic science model , compressive force EAROM improve rate bone callus differentiation , early healing , fracture angulation load bearing.This study aim translate basic science concept practice .</detailed_description>
