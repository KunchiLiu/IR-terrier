	<brief_title>Detection Tumor Associated Cell-free DNA Peritoneal Fluid Obtained Culdocentesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Feasibility Study , try evaluate whether culdocentesis detect tumor associate cell free DNA . Although first time investigator use type procedure detect cell free DNA , culdocentesis new procedure . It use do routinely past examine pelvic fluid . The investigator 's goal develop test detect ovarian cancer woman develop sign symptom disease . Currently , screen test ovarian cancer . This study use technique call `` culdocentesis '' detect DNA release ovarian cancer cell pelvic fluid . During culdocentesis , small needle insert vagina empty space uterus rectum call `` cul-de-sac . '' Fluid withdraw space sent analysis . Culdocentesis technique use many year examine pelvic fluid determine composition , previously study technique examine cell-free DNA detect ovarian cancer . The investigator suspect may useful way detect cell-free DNA ovarian cancer cell ovaries close cul-de-sac space . In study , investigator compare ability detect cell-free DNA fluid cul-de-sac ability detect cell-free DNA vaginal swab ( similar Pap smear ) , blood test , tissue specimen collect time surgery . The investigator hop learn study whether develop cell-free DNA test screen ovarian cancer involve culdocentesis would effective strategy .</detailed_description>
