	<brief_title>Polarization Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography ( PS-OCT ) Retinal Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma second lead cause blindness world . The current clinical standard-of-care procedure diagnose glaucoma visual field test disc photography . Visual field test subjective patient 's feedback physician 's interpretation feedback , disc photography require physician 's subjective interpretation . As result , estimate current method diagnose glaucoma 40 % nerve fiber layer ( NFL ) lose . Since glaucoma lead significant change NFL thickness NFL optical birefringence , non-invasive imaging property could potentially enable diagnosis glaucoma prior change vision . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) routinely use retinal imaging , ability detect change NFL health actively study . To detect NFL optical birefringence , specialize variation OCT term polarization sensitive OCT ( PS-OCT ) require . Because high noise PS-OCT image , prior study unable detect NFL change birefringence . We recently develop new method perform highly sensitive polarization-sensitive OCT . These change algorithmic nature , use optical wavelength power clinically deploy OCT retinal imaging instrument . In benchtop study , algorithmic change improve signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) PS-OCT image . We propose conduct pilot study normal , healthy subject evaluate change improve SNR NFL birefringence image .</detailed_description>
