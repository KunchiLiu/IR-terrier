	<brief_title>Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion : Endovascular Interventions v Standard Medical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial design compare safety efficacy endovascular treatment plus standard medical therapy standard medical therapy alone acute BA occlusion present within 8 h estimate occlusion time . There one ongoing clinical trial-Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study ( BASICS ) ( NCT01717755 ) aim evaluate efficacy safety additional intra-arterial treatment intravenous treatment 750 patient BA occlusion , anticipate complete Oct 2017 . Initiation intra-arterial therapy feasible within 6 hour estimate time BA occlusion . And patient require NIHSS ≥ 10 time randomization , take IV rt-PA , age 18-85 year old . In trial , investigator age NIHSS score limit , patient fulfill requirement IV rt-PA also include trial , investigator also extend time window 8 hour accelerate recruitment potential subject . In endovascular treatment arm , time interval randomization procedure finish control within 120 min . The preparation endovascular treatment start immediately randomization eligible patient IV rt-PA within 4.5 hour acute stroke onset , need wait one-hour rt-PA infusion . A positive trial suggest substantial clinical benefit endovascular treatment plus standard medical therapy standard medical therapy . This trial may provide novel evidence adopt endovascular treatment acute patient BA occlusion , may consequently advance current approach acute stroke treatment .</detailed_description>
