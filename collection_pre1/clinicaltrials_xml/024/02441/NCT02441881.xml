	<brief_title>Trial Radiofrequency Thermo-ablation Treatments Great Saphenous Varicose Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose To establish radiofrequency venous ablation modality effective prevent reflux treat segment GSV six month follow surgery . Design Results randomise trial meta-analyses show endovenous thermal ablation use radiofrequency ablation laser associate improved recovery compare conventional surgery GSV . Further , radiofrequency ( Closurefast ) show cause less pain require less analgesic intake laser . There two radiofrequency device theoretical advantage Closurefast technique . All three procedure use clinical practice ( include Worcestershire Royal Hospital ) . There trial date directly compare outcome three radiofrequency thermal ablation device . Recruitment Patients recruit Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust vascular surgical out-patient clinic . All patient receive duplex scan ( Toshiba Viamo Ultrasound , Tokyo , Japan Sonosite M-Turbo Bothell , Washington , USA ) prior entry trial confirm suitability endovenous thermal ablation treatment . During assessment patient also CEAP ( Clinical , Etiological , Anatomical , Pathophysiological ) classification severity aetiology venous disease score record . If patient consent trial ask fill disease specific Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire ( AVVQ ) generic quality life SF-36 Euroquol ( EQ-5D ) questionnaires Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) calculate . Patients recruit trial follow appropriate explanation study ( see patient information / consent sheet ) . Randomisation perform random number generator ( www.random.org ) . Patients randomise radiofrequency ablation either Closurefast ( Venefit , VNUS Medical Technologies , Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) , Radiofrequency induce Thermal Therapy ( RFiTT , Olympus Surgical Technologies Europe , Hamburg , Germany ) EndoVenous Radiofrequency ( EVRF , Medical Innovations , Bolton , United Kingdom ) . All treatment already use Worcestershire . Operation All treatment perform local tumescent anaesthesia . Patients receive thromboprophylaxis indicate line Hospital Trust 's local thromboprophylaxis protocol . Procedures perform duplex control ( Sonosite M-Turbo , Bothell , Washington , USA ) experience vascular surgery Specialist Registrar Consultant . The GSV catheterise percutaneously use Seldinger technique level low point reflux . The radiofrequency treatment catheter pass endoluminally level sapheno-femoral junction . Tumescent anaesthesia ( 50mg Prilocaine , 10mls 8.4 % sodium bicarbonate 1000mls 0.9 % saline ) inject peri-venous space patient ( 200 - 500ml ) . The position radiofrequency catheter confirm level sapheno-femoral junction prior commence radiofrequency current withdrawing catheter treat vein line local practice . The Closurefast withdrawn double treatment proximal segment long saphenous vein segmentally thereafter , RFiTT withdraw continuously retreatments , EVRF withdraw small stepwise movement ( per manufacturer 's instruction use ) . The volume anaesthetic administer , length vein treat duration ablation record . In line current NICE guidance ( CG168 ) , necessary , patient undergo avulsion local varicosity time . The number avulsion record group . Perforating vein directly treat . Treated leg dress dress pad full length bandage ( coban , 3M United Kingdom plc , Bracknell , Berkshire , UK ) compression hosiery . Patients discharge day surgery ( day-case ) oral analgesia require give contact information adverse event arise . Post-operative follow-up ) First week Patients ask keep pain score first post-operative week . This simple 10cm visual analogue score . All patient invite back clinic two week duplex scan ( blind assessment ) . During visit vascular team ass complication area ablation include bruising ( digital photographic record ) , wound infection , neuralgia , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolus . ii ) Six month The primary endpoint study ablate GSV . Treatment failure define segment treat trunk ( &gt; 2cm saphenofemoral junction ) patent ( compressible ) demonstrate reflux ( &gt; 1 second ) duplex scan . A number secondary outcome measure evaluate study : Pain score/ analgesic requirement Time return normal activity Absence recurrent varicose veins/return symptom Quality Of Life ( QoL ) : Disease specific ( AVVQ ) generic ( EQ5D &amp; SF36 ) quality life assessment compare 1 week post treatment , 6 month 12 month . The 1-week questionnaire give patient discharge , whereas QoL questionnaires sent patient . AVVQ widely utilise disease specific QoL tool venous disease extensively validate . A score 100 point calculate , high score indicate severe QoL impairment . Other Markers Of Clinical Success : The Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) assess 6 month . In addition , incidence complication relate endovenous intervention well presence residual / recurrent varicose vein also assess 2 week . Medium longer-term endpoint ( follow-up ) perform 2 year 5 year . However , likely limited high rate ( &gt; 20 % ) drop-out report study .</detailed_description>
