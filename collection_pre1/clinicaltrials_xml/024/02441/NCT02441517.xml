	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand benefit treatment medicine call enzalutamide re-treatment setting . Patients must previously treat enzalutamide pre-chemotherapy set minimum 8 month disease progress , follow docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel least 4 cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Enzalutamide Re-treatment Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer After Docetaxel and/or Cabazitaxel Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive treatment open-label enzalutamide , radiographic clinical progression ( pathological fracture , cord compression , worsen pain require radiation therapy , opioid analgesic dose increase initiation ) , unacceptable toxicity . Patients may allow continue enzalutamide next treatment initiate . If another non-cytotoxic , non-investigational , antineoplastic agent initiate protocol-defined progression determine , enzalutamide may continue long patient tolerate enzalutamide continue androgen deprivation therapy . Subjects safety follow-up visit approximately 30 day follow last dose study drug prior initiation subsequent anti-cancer drug investigational agent , whichever occur first . Disease progression survival follow every 12 week maximum 3 year first dose . The study end last subject follow 1 year date first dose</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without signet ring cell feature . Presence metastatic disease ( M1 ) assess Computed Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CT/MRI ) and/or wholebody radionuclide bone scan . Subject previously treat enzalutamide least 8 month , stop enzalutamide due progressive disease ( due adverse event ) , follow least 4 cycle docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel chemotherapy , without intervene anticancer therapy ( include limit aminoglutethimide , ketoconozole , abiraterone acetate , Rad223 , sipuleucelT ) , prior receive chemotherapy . Note : patient receive sequential taxanes , must progressive disease upon end first taxane , use anticancer agent two taxanes . Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) analogue prior bilateral orchiectomy ( medical surgical castration ) . For patient bilateral orchiectomy , must plan maintain effective GnRHanalogue duration trial . Testosterone ≤ 1.73 nmol/L ( ≤ 50 ng/dL ) screening . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 screening . Estimated life expectancy ≥ 6 month screen . Ability swallow study drug comply study requirement throughout study . Throughout study , male subject female partner childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable method birth control ( 1 must include condom barrier method contraception ) start screen continue throughout study period 3 month final study drug administration . Two acceptable method birth control thus include follow : Condom ( barrier method contraception ) AND One following require : Established use oral , injected , implanted hormonal method contraception female partner perform least 6 month screen ; Placement intrauterine device intrauterine system female partner ; Additional barrier method : Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository female partner ; Tubal ligation female partner . Vasectomy procedure result infertility ( e.g. , bilateral orchiectomy ) , perform least 6 month screen Must donate sperm screen 3 month final study drug administration . Known suspect neuroendocrine/small cell feature . Use antineoplastic treatment postchemotherapy , include limited aminoglutethimide , ketoconozole , abiraterone acetate , Rad223 , sipuleucelT , enzalutamide . Continuing steroid permit . Palliative radiation therapy within 2 week Day 1 , within 4 week Day 1 radionuclide utilized . Use investigational agent within 4 week Day 1 visit . Major surgery within 4 week prior Day 1 visit . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke significant brain trauma ) time past . History loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month screen . History clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction uncontrolled angina within 3 month ; History congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram multigated acquisition scan perform within three month result leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45 % ; History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) ; History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease screen include : Hypotension indicate systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 millimeter mercury ( mm Hg ) screening ; Bradycardia indicate heart rate &lt; 45 beat per minute screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) physical examination ; Uncontrolled hypertension indicate least 2 consecutive measurement rest systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg screen visit . Subject know suspected hypersensitivity enzalutamide component formulation use . Severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment . Known suspected brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease . Gastrointestinal disorder affect absorption ( e.g. , gastrectomy , active peptic ulcer disease within last 3 month ) . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/μL , platelet count &lt; 75,000/μL , hemoglobin &lt; 5.6 mmol/L ( 9 g/dL ) screening . Total bilirubin alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 2.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) screening . Creatinine &gt; 177 μmol/L ( &gt; 2 mg/dL ) screening . Albumin &lt; 30 g/L ( 3.0 g/dL ) screening . Treatment abiraterone acetate prior enzalutamide Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) prechemotherapy set . ( Note : Patients receive concomitant enzalutamide abiraterone acetate therapy exclude ) .</criteria>
