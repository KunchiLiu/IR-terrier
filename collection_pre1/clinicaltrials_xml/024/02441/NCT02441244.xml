	<brief_summary>Modern antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) transform clinical care live experience HIV infection . However , increase rate adverse health condition relate immune activation , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) neurodegenerative disease ART-treated individual persist . An important cause inflammation gut CD4 T cell loss `` leaking '' translocation luminal gut bacteria microbes across bowel wall bloodstream . The use complementary alternative therapy common among people live HIV , however efficacy generally well demonstrate . Probiotics live microbe may provide health benefit host investigator believe simultaneous use probiotic along antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) improve gut CD4 T cell restoration function therefore reduce microbial translocation immune activation . Probiotic Visbiome consist high potency blend eight different probiotic . The precise mechanism action Visbiome unknown , preclinical study show Visbiome may modulate immune response towards phenotype associate reduce inflammation , Visbiome also protective non-human primate model SIV infection . Therefore , believe `` beneficial '' bacteria Visbiome accelerate normalization gut immune cell function HIV-infected individual start ART . Early resolution gut immune cell may normalize microbial translocation immune activation reduce rate HIV-associated comorbidities .</brief_summary>
