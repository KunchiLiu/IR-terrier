	<detailed_description>Despite efficacy modern treatment , community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) lead cause death . Prognostic score , like CURB-65 ( confusion , urea , respiratory rate , arterial blood pressure age ) score pneumonia severity index ( PSI ) develop validated estimate risk adverse outcome register patient CAP hospital admission . Serum biomarkers also investigate patient CAP like Procalcitonin C-reactive protein . Elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) show associated adverse prognosis several cardiac condition critically ill patient . NT-proBNP also show important predictor emergency department hospitalize patient CAP . A grow number echocardiographic marker evaluate possible predictor prognosis patient pulmonary infectious disease sepsis , pulmonary tuberculosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Although effect pneumonia cardiac structure theoretically possible due increase systemic inflammatory activity , prothrombotic condition , biomechanical stress coronary artery , variation coronary arterial tone , alter myocardial metabolic balance infection , role transthoracic echocardiography never evaluate patient CAP . As echocardiography non-invasive , reliable , cost-effective , reproducible diagnostic tool evaluate cardiac function structure , investigator aim investigate leave right ventricular function aortic elastic property CAP patient . Furthermore , investigator also aim observe relationship echocardiographic finding inflammatory cardiac serum biomarkers patient CAP .</detailed_description>
