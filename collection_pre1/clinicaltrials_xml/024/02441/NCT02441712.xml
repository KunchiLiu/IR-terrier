	<brief_summary>This Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) regard conservative treatment patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) impairment base rehabilitation program . Those PFP variety impairment , knee hip muscle weakness , poor movement pattern , weak core activation muscle tightness . Several recent RCT trial look treat single impairment , date RCT address individualize patient impairment rehabilitation program . Abnormal muscle firing pattern also identify functional task ; jogging , stair climbing , perform single leg squat . Conflicting study produce change quadriceps hip muscle fire pattern PFP . The abnormal activation pattern suggest strengthen program alone improve movement pattern functional task PFP . Patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation ( PENS ) novel form electrical stimulation replicate proper fire pattern base healthy electromyography pattern . The purpose study investigate benefit PENS impairment base rehabilitation program treatment PFP . The rationale investigation ass benefit PENS therapeutic exercise improving alter firing pattern low extremity muscle functional task .</brief_summary>
