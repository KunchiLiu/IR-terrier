	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess new treatment pattern aflibercept . The aim achieve maintain best benefit visual function avoid unnecessary hospital visit . The hypothesis test whether intravitreous aflibercept give 8 week cycle treatment year 1 cap treat extend treatment paradigm year 2 lead improve vision read speed eye active wet AMD 2 year reduce hospital visit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent form Age ≥ 50 year either gender Women must postmenopausal least 12 month prior trial entry , surgically sterile . If child bear potential , serum pregnancy test negative result must obtain within 14 day prior first treatment . Women child bear potential must practice effective contraception implement trial least 60 day follow last dose study medication . No condition preclude followup 2 year . No contraindication intravitreous injection aflibercept . Study eye must meet follow criterion entry trial must vision loss account wet AMD : Newly diagnose , angiographically document , previously untreated , active CNV lesion ( i.e. , leakage fluorescein angiography AND subretinal , intraretinal , subRPE fluid OCT ) secondary agerelated macular degeneration . Best correct visual acuity score study eye 80 23 letter inclusive , use ETDRS testing , ( 6/7.5 6/96 Snellen equivalent ) , inclusive . The CNV sequela CNV ( i.e. , pigment epithelium detachment , subretinal haemorrhage , block fluorescence , macular edema , subretinal intraretinal fluid ) must involve centre fovea . The total area fibrosis must comprise less 50 % total lesion . &gt; 1 drusen ( &gt; 63 micron ) either eye OR late AMD fellow eye No previous treatment CNV study eye Clear ocular medium adequate pupillary dilation permit good quality fundus image . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study participation : 6.2.1 Prior/Concomitant Treatment Any previous treatment wet AMD ( include verteporfin PDT , Macugen® , Lucentis® , intravitreous Avastin® , thermal laser , external beam radiation surgery AMD ) study eye Current plan use systemic medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve , include deferoxamine , chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil® ) , phenothiazines ethambutol . Previous participation study investigational drug likely ocular effect within 30 day precede initial study treatment Concurrent previous use systemic antiVEGF agent . Any intraocular procedure ( include YttriumAluminiumGarnet capsulotomy ) within 2 month prior Screening anticipate within next 6 month follow Screening 6.2.2 Lesion Characteristics Permanent structural damage ( fibrosis atrophy ) involve centre fovea study eye CNV either eye due cause , ocular histoplasmosis , trauma , pathologic myopia Retinal pigment epithelial tear involve fovea study eye 6.2.3 Concurrent Ocular Conditions Any concurrent intraocular condition either eye ( e.g. , cataract diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion investigator , could either require medical surgical intervention 2 year followup period prevent treat visual loss might result condition , , allow progress untreated , could likely contribute loss least 2 Snellen equivalent line best correct visual acuity 2 year followup period . Active recent ( within 4 week ) intraocular inflammation ( grade trace ) either eye Neovascularisation iris , neovascular glaucoma vitreous haemorrhage either eye screen visit History rhegmatogenous retinal detachment , epiretinal membrane , vitreomacular traction macular hole study eye investigator opinion , think limit potential vision improvement treatment wet AMD History vitrectomy study eye Active infectious conjunctivitis , blepharitis , keratitis , scleritis , endophthalmitis either eye time screen Spherical equivalent refractive error study eye demonstrate 8 diopter myopia For subject undergone prior refractive cataract surgery study eye , preoperative refractive error study eye exceed 8 diopter myopia . Intraocular surgery ( include cataract surgery ) study eye within 2 month precede first study treatment . Uncontrolled glaucoma either eye time screen ( define intraocular pressure &gt; 25 mmHg despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) Inability photograph document CNV ( eg due allergy fluorescein dye , lack venous access cataract obscure CNV ) . Inability obtain OCT image reasonable quality allow analysis lesion macular fluid Patients ocular disease condition compromise visual acuity study eye amblyopia , anterior ischemic optic neuropathy , previous complicate cataract surgery , aphakia , vitreomacular traction diabetic macular oedema 6.2.4 Concurrent Systemic Conditions Females childbearing potential male must willing use effective method contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time consent sign 6 week treatment discontinuation . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day prior registered trial treatment NOTE : Subjects consider child bear potential surgically sterile ( i.e . undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Pregnancy breastfeed History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication Current treatment active systemic infection Evidence significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases cardiovascular disease , nervous system , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , endocrine , gastrointestinal disorder History recurrent significant infection bacterial infection Inability comply study followup procedure Stroke myocardial infarction le 3 month Screening date Known hypersensitivity aflibercept</criteria>
