	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study Bone Marrow Tryptase ( MT ) level diagnostic marker Systemic Mastocytosis ( SM ) . Determination bone marrow tryptase Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMA ) could new diagnostic criterion systemic mastocytosis sensitivity close 100 % low false negative rate . This new test could useful improve ability diagnose accurately systemic mastocytosis ( particular indolent form ) . Because limited invasiveness compare bone marrow biopsy , could also consider test perform bone marrow biopsy . Only patient high bone marrow tryptase would undergo bone marrow biopsy . In future validate study , bone marrow tryptase could useful marker mast cell load help monitor efficacy treatment systemic mastocytosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mastocytosis group disorder characterize clonal accumulation mast cell various organ . Diagnosis mastocytosis challenge patient remain undiagnosed year . Using diagnostic criterion define World Health Organization ( WHO ) mastocytosis divide Cutaneous Mastocytosis ( CM ) Systemic Mastocytosis ( SM ) . Study suggest measurement tryptase plasma Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMA ) could useful diagnosis SM . Results preliminary study Toulouse University Hospital suggest Bone Marrow Tryptase Level ( MT ) 50 µg/L may sensitive diagnostic criterion ( sensitivity 94.7 % ) histological result BMB ( major diagnostic criterion SM sensitivity 68 80 % expert center ) diagnosis SM patient mastocytosis skin . Because preliminary study do limited number patient single center , diagnostic value MT diagnosis SM , confirm large representative population . In addition , investigator propose evaluate : - The diagnostic accuracy MT diagnosis SM patient without mastocytosis skin ; - The diagnostic accuracy absolute correct MT diagnosis SM without mastocytosis skin ; - The diagnostic accuracy MT/ST ratio diagnosis SM without mastocytosis skin ; - The diagnostic accuracy flow cytometry perform cell collect BMA maintain preservative solution diagnosis SM without mastocytosis skin ; - The diagnostic accuracy quantification fraction KIT mutation-positive cell peripheral blood diagnosis SM without mastocytosis skin ; - Correlation result quantification fraction KIT mutation-positive cell peripheral blood result MT level , result MT/ST ratio result absolute corrected MT ; - Correlation result CF perform EDTA/TransFix® tube sodium heparin tube validate transport condition ( 20-25°C within 24 96H ) CF ; analyze perform first 50 sample BMA . The samples diagnosis test make day inclusion . For enrolled patient , one 5 mL sample peripheral blood ( EDTA ) 1 mL sample BM aspirate ( 0,5 mL EDTA/TransFix® tube et 0,5 mL sodium heparinate tube ) collect day , ship less 24 96H ( +20-25°C ) central laboratory . For patient , genomic DNA total leucocyte purify peripheral blood EDTA sample , use later quantification kit mutation real-time qPCR . The plasma tryptase level measure peripheral blood EDTA sample aliquot take DNA extraction . The bone marrow aspirate sample use first immunophenotyping BM mastocyte flow cytometry ( FC ) , , centrifugation , measurement BM tryptase level . The degree dilution BM aspirate peripheral blood estimate compare percentage CD16bright vs. CD16low granulocytes BM sample , use adjust BM tryptase . Tryptase measurement make EDTA Na , heparinate plasma , use standardize fluoro enzyme immunoassay automate analyzer . Immunophenotyping BM mastocyte perform BM aspiration stabilize TransFix® ( Cellular Antigen Stabilisation Reagent ) ( firsts 50 sample BM aspiration Na , heparinate ) use pre-defined mixture anti-CD45/CD117/CD34/CD2/CD25/CD16 antibody , couple appropriate fluorochrome . Genomic DNA BM leucocytes extract 300-500µL peripheral blood ( anti coagulate EDTA ) use Promega DNA automate extractor , subsequently store +4°C . Quantitative PCR perform use pre-validated qPCR assay ( Life Technologies , Foster City , CA ) 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System ( Life Technologies ) . The end study visit perform day patient see make aware result clinical laboratory investigation make . This also day plan medical management mastocytosis discuss .</detailed_description>
