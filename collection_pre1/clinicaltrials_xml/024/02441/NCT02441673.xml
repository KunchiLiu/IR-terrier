	<brief_summary>Post Anaesthetic Shivering common complication Subarachnoid block . It grade base 's severity know cause various problem like patient 's discomfort , hypoxia , change hemodynamic variable patient poor wound heal . This problem manage via pharmacologic non-pharmacologic mean . Non-pharmacologic modality involve option aim warm patient . Pharmacologically , opioids use commonly prevent treat condition . This introduces side effect nausea/vomiting sedation may reduce overall patient 's satisfaction perception Subarachnoid block . It reason Nefopam - centrally act non-opioid , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) analgesic , relatively new drug Nigerian market significant anti-shivering effect compare well establish opioid like Tramadol . Having similar cost profile , option replace Tramadol Nefopam especially condition patient hemodynamically unstable consider project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nefopam v Tramadol Prevention Post Anaesthetic Shivering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY LOCATION This study would carry Gbagada General Hospital General hospital Lagos state . They secondary health care facility 800 bed space Gbagada 3000 centre . Gbagada suburban area centrally locate Lagos state General hospital establish 1983 . STUDY DESIGN The study would prospective , double-blinded , randomise control study investigator patient would blind study drug . Patients would randomise 2 group . In one group , patient would give 1mg/kg tramadol diluted water injection volume 10mls . In second group patient would receive 0.15mg/kg nefopam diluted water injection volume 10mls . STUDY POPULATION Patients age 18 45 year American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status II III schedule Caesarean Sessions ( CS ) amenable Subarachnoid block give write informed consent recruit study ANAESTHETIC TECHNIQUE Participants would randomly divide 2 group . Nefopam Tramadol group via randomization system . PREPARATION Patients would recruit night morning surgery . They would review allay fear , determine fitness part study get consent join . They would give information/consent paper study illiterate understand , content would explain language understand . Verbal write consent would obtain . After adequately examine , routine investigation carry patient fast , 2 wide bore Intravenous line would sit patient weigh . Patients would routinely give premedication : IV Metoclopramide 10mg IV Ranitidine 50mg RANDOMIZATION Patient would randomly assign either two group , tramadol nefopam group . A randomization schedule would prepare sealed envelope randomly generate odd even number . The number would see assistant would prepare chosen medication colourless 10mls unmarked syringe . Nefopam would give 0.15mg/kg Tramadol 1mg/kg . The patient Administrator would blind content syrinx . The Assistant code would remain within theatre premise event need , repeat choose drug break code event drug reaction . The theatre environment would keep ambient temperature 20 - 25oC active warm would institute . The Administrator Researcher would assess patient primary outcome ( shiver ) side effect study medication . INDUCTION Baseline vital sign Non-Invasive Blood Pressure , Mean Arterial Pressure , Pulse Rate , Oxygen Saturation Temperature measurement would take . Patient would preloaded I0mls/kg Normal saline 15mins initiation block . Placed sit position pillow support , routine draping asepsis would maintain use 25 guage ( G ) 26G quincke needle , 12.5mg 0.5 % heavy bupivacaine would inject level L2/L3 L4/L5 interspace . Patient would place supine give pre-chosen drug via slow intravenous injection assistant part study Time 0 use Stop Clock . After initiation block , parameter would measure every 5minutes first 15mins every 15 minute 60minutes post initiation block . If shivering occur , severity would check principal investigator repeat dose drug give assistant . If n't abate another 5minutes , rescue drug 25mg Pethidine would give patient . Type surgery , Bupivacaine dose use , Highest sensory block reach 10minutes use alcohol swab , Shivering score , Sedation Scores Duration surgery would document . Hemodynamic parameter take begin surgery would also record every 5minutes 60minutes . Hypotension define less 20 % baseline MAP value 60mmHg would treat increase maintenance fluid Ephedrine use 3mg aliquot . Incidence PAS would determine group ; Duration start block onset PAS method stop PAS need adopt like repeat initial dose IV pethidine 25mg .</detailed_description>
