	<detailed_description>The replacement traditional approach surgical care demonstrate surgical recovery accelerate convalescence decrease . These multimodal approach focus enhance recovery reduce morbidity reduction surgical stress , minimal invasive surgery , optimize pain relief , early nutrition ambulation . In postoperative , bed rest lead increase muscle loss weakness , impairs pulmonary function , predispose venous stasis thromboembolism , increase infection complication reduce functional capacity even patient restrict bed . However , study focus start mobilization effect functional capacity exercise lung function hospital stay . In trial investigator consider early rehabilitation safe feasible Nuss procedure .</detailed_description>
