	<detailed_description>Cancer second most-common cause death industrialized country . Preclinical study clinical observation show PI3K/AKT/mammalian ( mechanistic ) target Rapamycin ( know 'mTOR-pathway ' ) signal deregulate several tumor . The mTOR evolutionary conserve Serine/Threonine protein kinase sense integrate signal different environmental cue . It central regulator cell growth , cell cycle progression , proliferation metabolism . It find form two distinct , multiprotein complex base bind different partner . In complex Regulatory-Associated Protein mTOR ( Raptor ) mTOR form mTORC1 , whereas bound Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion mTOR ( Rictor ) mTOR Complex 2 ( mTORC2 ) form . Not structure mTOR complexes different , also characterize distinct biological function mediate individual downstream target . The mTORC1 promote cap-dependent translation elongation , increase Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) biogenesis well promote ribosome biogenesis - via regulation p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 ( p70S6K ) well eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) bind protein 1 ( 4EBP-1 ) . In addition mTORC1 promote lipid synthesis via sterol regulatory element bind protein 1 ( SREBP1 ) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARγ ) . The role mTORC2 less define . The best characterized , mTORC2 target AKT , regulate cell survival , metabolism proliferation well differentiation many primary cancer cell type . Another direct target mTORC2 serum- glucocorticoid-regulated kinase ( SGK ) control cell survival anabolism protein kinase Cα ( PKCα ) involve control cytoskeletal organization . Thus constitutive , oncogenic activation mTOR signal promotes protein lipid synthesis need increase cell mass enhance surface transporter expression sustain good uptake glucose , amino acid nutrient sustain cell growth proliferation transform cell . Since mTOR signal pathway critical tumorigenesis , inhibitor strongly want . As first approve FDA clinical set Rapamycin activity transplant organ rejection prophylactic agent Graft-versus-Host disease allogenic bone marrow transplantation . The immunosuppressive effect Rapamycin initially attribute ability block Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) induce proliferation . However , later find case , rather work immunomodulation , part due induction expansion T cell regulatory phenotype . Moreover , T cell mTORC1 modulates T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 Th17 fate , mTORC2 control Th2 development . Also , Rapamycin involve immunostimulation long-lived memory cluster differentiation 8+ ( CD8+ ) T cell . In addition Rapamycin effect T cell , drug exerts inhibitory effect proliferation function immune cell dendritic cell , B lymphocytes , Natural Killer cell ( NK ) , neutrophile mast cell . Lastly , Rapamycin test chemotherapy agent cancer show delay growth proliferation promote apoptosis many cancer cell line , also possess anti-angiogenic property . During past year different rapalogs synthesize among Everolimus ( RAD001 , Afinitor® ) currently test clinical trial phase IV patient renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) advance large cell lung cancer neuroendocrine differentiation well phase III metastatic breast cancer . In addition , already approve different tumor first-line treatment ineffective . Even Everolimus seem promising neoplastic agent , clinical data effect immune competence patient . And still remain unknown whether Everolimus exert similar Rapamycin effect modulation immune system administrate cancer patient .</detailed_description>
