	<detailed_description>Currently , `` cure '' spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Although scientific understanding central nervous system ( CNS ) regeneration advance greatly past twenty year , still many unknown regard induce successful regeneration , especially chronic SCI . A realistic approach , base currently available knowledge , improve quality life large proportion paralyze population may develop treatment elicit partial functional recovery base neuroplastic potential spar neural pathway . In scenario , acute intermittent hypoxia ( AIH ) enhance inherit capacity neuroplasticity strengthen survive synaptic input onto spinal motorneurons , trigger functional recovery follow SCI rat humans AIH-induced neuroplasticity extensively study phrenic motor nucleus ( C3-C5 ) phrenic nerve record preparation ( Mitchell , 2007 ) . Briefly , moderate AIH ( 3 , 5-min hypoxic episode ; PaO2 35-45 mmHg ; 5-min interval ) elicit phrenic long term facilitation ( pLTF ) , type memory present cervical spinal cord . The mechanism AIH-induced pLTF episodic hypoxia activate raphe serotonergic neuron project phrenic motor nucleus . Spinal serotonin release hypoxic episodes subsequently activate serotonin type 2 ( 5-HT2 ) receptor couple Gq protein near phrenic motor neuron , initiate intracellular cascade underlie pLTF . pLTF require spinal 5-HT2 receptor activation , new synthesis brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) activation high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase ( TrkB ) follow ERK MAP kinase signal . Although downstream signal event ERK less clear , speculated glutamate receptor phosphorylated , increase glutamatergic transmission perhaps insertion within phrenic motor neuron , thereby establish LTF . Longer time domain AIH , example , daily acute intermittent hypoxia ( i.e . dAIH , 10 episode per day , 7 day ) show strengthen synaptic pathway spinal motorneurons increase respiratory locomotor recovery cervical SCI unanesthetized rat . This functional improvement accompany increase BDNF TrkB level within cervical ( C7 ) motor nuclei innervate forelimb . Although detailed mechanism functional recovery somatic thoracic lumbar motorneurons verify , propose serotonin-dependent mechanism facilitate motor output respiratory non-respiratory motor nucleus . The use dAIH improve limb function human incomplete , chronic SCI show promising result . A single presentation AIH ( 15 , 1-minute episode 9 % O2 alternate 1-minute 21 % O2 ) incomplete , chronic ( &gt; 1 year ) spinal cord injury patient , classify C D accord International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury ( ISNCSCI ) , increase ability voluntarily generate plantar flexion 4 h post-hypoxia . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover design study , impact daily AIH ( 15 episode per day , 90 sec 9 % O2 , 60 sec normoxic interval , 5 consecutive day ) combine walk train studied 19 chronic , incomplete SCI patient ( ISNCSCI D ) . Daily AIH alone increase walk speed 18 % three day treatment ( 10 walk test ) ; whereas dAIH combine walk train improved walk speed distance ( 37 % ) 5 day 1 week post-dAIH . Importantly , change cognitive function observe dAIH , suggest moderate dose AIH safe human . Although dAIH ( 5 consecutive day AIH ) demonstrate beneficial effect incomplete SCI patient , effect last one week ; therefore , important design extend protocol maintain initial functional effect dAIH time . Repetitive AIH ( rAIH ) consist AIH three time per week ( 3×wAIH ) 10 week demonstrate increase respiratory function maintain increase functional effect elicit dAIH unanesthetized rat . Moreover , rAIH increase expression key molecule involve AIH-induced spinal plasticity unanesthetized rat . Therefore , repetitive AIH may represent safe effective strategy enhance functional recovery chronic incomplete spinal cord injury . The protocol intermittent hypoxia propose project correspond moderate dose intermittent hypoxia , equivalent climb mountain 5000 meter altitude . Abundant literature demonstrate moderate AIH ( ≥ 9 % O2 , &lt; 15 cycles/day ) several multi-systemic beneficial effect : reduces arterial hypertension , strengthen innate immune response , reduces inflammation , reduce body weight , increase aerobic capacity , improve glucose tolerance , increase bone mineral density , enhance spatial learn memory , rescue ischemia-induced memory impairment , reduce symptom depression , improve post-ischemic recovery myocardial contractile function , increase respiratory capacity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Moreover , moderate repetitive AIH improve respiratory somatic function SCI , without adverse consequence hypertension , neuronal cell loss and/or reactive gliosis systemic inflammation . Therefore , potential beneficial effect AIH limit spinal cord injury include wide scope clinical condition . Combinatorial therapy , one activity-based training , augment plasticity incomplete SCI . In rat incomplete SCI , dAIH combine ladder walk lead near complete recovery ladder walk ability . Moreover , dAIH overground walk improve walk speed distance incomplete SCI patient ISNCSCI D. Research study animal human find retrain SCI use intrinsic physiologic property nervous system facilitate recovery function . This potential retraining base activity-dependent plasticity drive repetitive task-specific sensory input spinal network . The prominent well-developed activity-based therapy ( physical rehabilitation ) date locomotor training . The fundamental principle locomotor train build premise robustly approximate sensorimotor experience walk repetitive practice include : 1 ) maximize load bear low extremity minimize load bearing upper extremity , 2 ) optimize sensory cue walk , 3 ) optimize kinematics ( i.e. , trunk extremity ) motor task , 4 ) maximize recovery strategy minimize compensatory mechanism . The fundamental mechanism support intervention derive largely study conduct spinalised animal . Specifically , treadmill train increase axonal regrowth collateral sprout proximal lesion site mouse ( Goldshmit et al. , 2008 ) , phosphorylation Erk1/2 motor cortex well spinal cord injury area ( Oh et al. , 2009 ) , expression brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) spinal cord , ameliorate muscle atrophy moderate contuse SCI rat , alters property spinal motor neuron . Body weight-supported treadmill training ( BWSTT ) base optimize sensory input relevant step training , repeat practice , possible optimization neuroplasticity . Uncontrolled study acute chronic SCI patient show within-subject improvement walk ability use BWSTT . Investigators propose BWSTT therapy provide behavioral therapy independently support positive outcome . AIH combine body weight-assisted training represent simple safe , non-pharmacological method enhance neuroplasticity spinal cord thus , improve walk function patient incomplete spinal cord injury . At cellular level , BWSTT AIH increase expression BDNF . BDNF wide repertoire neurotrophic neuroprotective property CNS periphery ; namely , neuronal protection survival , neurite expression , axonal dendritic growth remodeling , neuronal differentiation synaptic plasticity synaptogenesis arborize axon terminal , synaptic transmission efficacy . Thus , BWSTT may serve catalyst tandem repetitive AIH combine develop even good response . Currently , approve therapy chronic SCI ; therefore , approach represent promise new strategy enhance function patient sub-acute chronic SCI , potential functional gain limit . Investigators propose triple blind ( patient , outcome assessor stadistician ) randomize , placebo-controlled study test combine effect intermittent hipoxia body weight-supported treadmill train incoplete spinal cord injury patient .</detailed_description>
