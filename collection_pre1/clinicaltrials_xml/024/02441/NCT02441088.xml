	<detailed_description>Participants research study tumor express somatostatin receptor neuroendocrine tumor , medulloblastoma , meningioma , neuroblastoma . The purpose research study determine 90Y-DOTATOC effective treatment tumor express somatostatin receptor 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT measure extent disease measure response therapy . This research determine process call dosimetry effective technique determine much 90Y-DOTATOC participant safely receive without damage kidney bone marrow . Goals study : 1 . Demonstrate safety efficacy dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy ( PRRT ) use 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ( 90Y-DOTATOC ) patient neuroendocrine somatostatin receptor express tumor . 2 . Monitor adverse event associate peptide receptor radiotherapy use 90Y-DOTATOC . 3 . Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ( 68Ga-DOTATOC ) PET/CT accurate technique diagnosis , stag , treatment targeting , monitor response 90Y-DOTATOC therapy . Approximately 64 people participate study conduct University Iowa .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Disease amenable standard treatment ( nonresectable disease present one surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment ) subject fail exist first line chemotherapy , biologic therapy , target agent therapy radiation therapy . 2 . Participation Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry . 3 . A pathologically confirm ( histology cytology ) malignant neoplasm least one target lesion confirm conventional imaging determine express somatostatin receptor 68GaDOTATOC ( TATE ) PET within 120 day prior treatment 90YDOTATOC . 4 . The target lesion one either never receive external beam radiation irradiate previously irradiate since demonstrate progression . Any local irradiation target lesion nontarget lesion via external beam , conformal stereotactic radiation treatment must occur 4 week prior study drug administration . Any full craniospinal radiation , whether target lesion include field , must occur 3 month prior study drug administration . 5 . Life expectancy &gt; /= 2 month time study drug administration . 6 . Neuroendocrine archival tissue previous biopsy require . 7 . Age ≥ 6 months100 year time study drug administration . 8 . Performance status determine Karnofsky ≥ 60 % Lansky Play Scale ≥ 60 % time study drug administration . 9 . Completion Norfolk Quality Life Questionnaire . 10 . Within 7±10 day study drug administration , patient must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet &gt; 90,000/mm3 total bilirubin &lt; 3X ULN age AST ( SGOT ) &amp; ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 10X institutional upper limit normal age urinalysis great 1+ hematuria proteinuria Renal function* Adults ( age 18 &gt; ) : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl ; serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL , nuclear GFR measure . GFR need ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 subject ≤40 year old , ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 subject 4150 ; ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 subject 5160 ; ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 subject &gt; 60 year old . Children ( age &lt; 18 ) : nuclear GFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 * Renal function criterion base previous experience 90YDOTATOC therapy know change GFR age 11 . The effect 90YDOTAtyr3Octreotide develop human fetus unknown . For reason Class C agent know teratogenic , woman men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Pregnant woman exclude study 90YDOTATOC Class C agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . 2 . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother 90YDOTATOC , breastfeed discontinue 6 week last administration study drug . 3 . Surgery within 4 week study drug administration . 4 . External beam radiation kidney ( scatter dose &lt; 500 cGy single kidney radiation &lt; 50 % single kidney acceptable ) . 5 . Prior PRRT 90YDOTATOC ( TATE ) 177LuDOTATOC ( TATE ) 131IMIBG therapy malignancy . 6 . Another investigational drug within 4 week study drug administration . 7 . Concurrent , malignant disease patient active therapy . 8 . Another significant medical , psychiatric , surgical condition currently uncontrolled treatment would likely affect subject 's ability complete protocol . 9 . Any subject , opinion physician , 12hour discontinuation somatostatin analogue therapy represent health risk . Also subject receive longacting somatostatin analogue past 28 day longacting lanreotide within past 16 week exclude . Subjects may maintain short act octreotide time last injection longacting somatostatin analogue 12 hr prior injection study drug . Known antibody Octreotide , Lanreotide , DOTATOC history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 90YDOTATOC . 10 . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) study drug administration recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 11 . Uncontrolled illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 12 . Subject weigh 450 pound . ( Subjects weigh 450 pound able fit inside image machine ) . 13 . Inability lie still entire imaging time ( due cough , severe arthritis , etc . ) .</criteria>
