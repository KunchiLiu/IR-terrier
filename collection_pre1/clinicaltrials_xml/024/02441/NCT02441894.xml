	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess tolerability cabazitaxel 25 mg per body surface area ( m^2 ) primary prophylactic polyethylene glycol-granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( PEG-G-CSF ) term incidence rate febrile neutropenia ( FN ) ( define : absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] &lt; 1000 per volume [ mm^3 ] single temperature &gt; 38.3 degree sustain temperature ≥38 degree Celsius one hour ) Cycle 1 . Secondary Objective : To assess overall rate FN grade ≥3 neutropenia diarrhea ; frequency dose delay due adverse event ( AEs ) ; dose reduction due AEs ; relative dose intensity ; incidence FN-related hospitalization use intravenous ( IV ) anti-infectives ; tolerability accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) v4.0 ; prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) response ( 50 % decrease ) ; tumor response accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 available .</brief_summary>
