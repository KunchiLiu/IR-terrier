	<brief_summary>This study assess utility high resolution 3D echo planar magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 3D EPSI ) monitor Novo-TTF response glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Therapeutic Response Novo-TTF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient ask 4 MRI scan brain course 6 month . Before patient participate study negative urine pregnancy test may require woman child-bearing age . Each MRI scan take approximately 1 hour complete . The first MRI scan perform patient enrolled Novo-TTF treatment therapy , prior initiation Novo-TTF therapy . The second MRI scan perform 2-3 week therapy begin . The third MRI scan perform 2 month start Novo-TTF treatment last MRI scan perform 4 month start Novo-TTF treatment . The MRI study conduct Center Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectroscopy Department Radiology , University Pennsylvania Medical Center . The study scan similar routine clinical MRI scan brain . The patient ask lie specially design bed circular antenna place around patient head . The patient give earplug wear decrease bang noise cause imaging process . The earplugs block sound since MRI tech 's wish stay communication patient time . The MRI techs move patient magnet , large hollow cylinder , patient head center . The study proceed . The MRI operator inform patient progress study . The patient need keep perfectly still scan . During MRI scan , patient intravenous line ( IV line ) place . The IV line allow contrast agent inject patient 's vein . MRI contrast agent chemical travel bloodstream . They act like dye make MRI picture brighter easy read . When study complete , patient move magnet . The MRI operator ask patient please get slowly since patient lie still relatively long period time . The investigator also review patient 's medical record information medical history , current past medication therapy , information relate patient 's GBM .</detailed_description>
