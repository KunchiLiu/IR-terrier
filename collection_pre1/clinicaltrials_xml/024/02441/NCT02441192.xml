	<detailed_description>The study cardiovascular cardiorespiratory coupling ( CVRC ) hot topic medical literature focus recognize synergy present healthy physiology [ 7 , 8 ] . Several effect age [ 9 ] , diseases [ 8 ] mental state intervention [ 10 ] cardiorespiratory coupling investigate , however , although potential interest , study effect train program detrain . Two main type train program ( aerobic- AT resistance- RT ) widely investigate important different physiological effect [ 11 ] . Its combination ( AT+RT ) , recently recommend health purpose extensive type population [ 12-14 ] . The physiological effect aerobic training program traditionally evaluate cardiorespiratory reserve detection maximal threshold subsystem variable [ 1 ] . As complex adaptive system ( CAS ) , human organism act indivisible integrated whole reduce sum subsystem function [ 2 ] . In CAS cardiovascular cardiorespiratory subsystem interdependent interact dynamic nonlinear way , i.e . non-proportional , need approach nonlinear model [ 3 ] , study time series complex system ( CS ) methodologies [ 4 ] . As CAS enter every new situation exist set capability [ 5 ] exchange continuously information environment her/his behavior unique unexpected short term ( week , month ) [ 6 ] , usual duration common training program . In order study coupling coordination multiple variable CAS , CS approach propose detection so-called order parameter , collective coordinative variable , capture order coordination system [ 3 , 15 ] . The principal component ( PC ) analysis common statistical technique use recognize coordinative variable vast domain biological research field like : motor control [ 16 ] , brain dynamic [ 17 ] , DNA replication [ 18 ] protein fold [ 19 ] . The PC analysis reduces data dimension highly couple system extract small number component account variation original multivariate data summarize little loss information . PCs extract decrease order importance first PC account much variation possible successive component account little less [ 20 ] . The number PCs reflect dimensionality system , decrease number PCs indicative major couple ( less dimension ) vice-versa . The number PCs change system suffers nonlinear change , i.e . qualitative coordinative reconfiguration . The PCs technique apply kinematic variable successfully use study effect motor learn process [ 16 ] , apply yet study training effect physiological variable . The aim research investigate dimensional change CVCRC period 6 week different train modality ( AT , RT AT+RT ) 3 week detrain healthy young men . Material Methods Participants . To determine sample size power analysis perform . Using effect size = .80 , alfa &lt; .05 , power ( 1 - beta ) = .95 , three repeat window , estimate sample size = 32 [ 21 ] . Thirty-two healthy physically active male , physical education student ( age 21.2 ± 2.4 y. , height 177.1 ± 0.66 cm , mean body mass 71.0 ± 5.1 kg mean body -mass index 22.6 ± 1.7 kg·m-2 ) sport specialization engage wide range aerobic activity least three time week volunteer participate study . After baseline test distribute four randomize group 6 week training : aerobic ( AT ) , resistance ( RT ) , aerobic+resistance ( AT+RT ) control ( C ) . Procedure . Participants complete standard medical questionnaire confirm healthy status sign informed consent form . All experimental procedure approve local bio-ethics committee carry accordance ethical guideline lay Helsinki Declaration . After baseline cardiorespiratory test maximal strength power test ( see ) follow 3 time week assign specific train program : 1 . AT group ( n = 8 ) : pedal 60 min 60 % individual maximum workload ( 60 % Wmax ) . This workload increase 5 % weekly unless participant unable keep pace throughout session . Heart rate monitor session . 2 . RT group ( n = 8 ) : perform twice 30 min strength circuit [ 14 ] . Forty per cent 1RM upper body ( i.e. , squat , chest press , shoulder press , triceps extension , biceps curl , pull-down [ upper back ] ) , 60 % low body ( quadriceps extension , leg press , leg curl [ hamstring ] , calf raise ) use start weight . They allow participant maximum 12 repetition include slow control movement ( 2 4 ) . The resting period exercise 2 min . Workloads adjust weekly , resistance increase need ( typically 5 10 % ) participant able lift weight comfortably ( i.e. , 12 repetition ) . 3 . AT+RT group ( n = 8 ) : pedal 60 % Wmax 30 min perform strength circuit ( R group ) . 4 . C group ( n = 8 ) : continue usual activity , without special training . Cardiorespiratory testing . The incremental cycling test ( Excalibur , Lode , Groningen , Netherlands ) start 0W workload increase 20W/min exhaustion participant could keep prescribed cycle frequency 70rpm 5 consecutive second . All test perform well-ventilated lab ; room temperature 23ºC relative humidity 48 % , variation 1ºC temperature 10 % relative humidity . During test subject breathe valve ( Hans Rudolph 2700 , Kansas City , MO , USA ) respiratory gas exchange determine use automate open-circuit system ( Metasys , Brainware , La Valette , France ) . Oxygen CO2 content air flow rate record breath breath . Before trial , system calibrate mixture O2 CO2 know composition ( O2 15 % , CO2 5 % , N2 balance ) ( Carburos Metálicos , Barcelona , Spain ) ambient air . Hemodynamic information participant determine non-invasive finger cuff technology ( Nexfin , BMEYE Amsterdam , Netherlands ) . The Nexfin device provide continuous blood pressure ( BP ) monitoring result pulse pressure waveform , calculates : systolic diastolic blood pressure ( SBP DBP ) . Participants connect wrap inflatable cuff around middle phalanx finger . The finger artery pulse 'fixed ' constant volume application equivalent change pressure blood pressure result waveform pressure ( clamp volume method ) . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) continuously monitor ( DMS Systems , DMS-BTT wireless Bluetooth ECG transmitter receiver , software DMS Version 4.0 , Beijing , China ) . The test carry least 3 hour light meal participant instruct perform vigorous physical activity 72 hour test . Participants repeat test 6 week train 3 week detrain . Maximal strength power testing . Maximal strength maximal power upper low limb , respectively , measure ( Musclelab Power System , Porsgruun , Norway ) participant . Estimated 1 RM-chest press 1RM-squat base submaximal load calculate . In chest press exercise load start 25 kg , continue 35 kg , 45 kg , 55 kg , 65 kg , etc . squat exercise start 45 kg continue 65 kg , 85 kg , 105 kg , etc . could perform 1 repetition . Based result maximal 1RM registered force/velocity relationship graph plot determine maximal power . All exercise test carry least 3 hour light meal participant instruct perform vigorous physical activity 72 hour test . Participants repeat test 6 week train 3 week detrain . Data analysis The follow maximal value performance cardiorespiratory variable register test : maximal cycling workload ( Wmax ) , maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) , maximal expiratory ventilation per minute ( VE max ) , maximal heart rate ( HR max ) , maximal 1RM-squat maximal 1RM-chest . The group mean different condition compare use non-parametric Friedman . A PC analysis time series follow select cardiorespiratory variable : expire fraction O2 ( FeO2 ) , expire fraction CO2 ( FeCO2 ) , ventilation ( VE ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) heart rate ( HR ) perform obtain information CVCRC participant . The median PC1 coefficient congruence obtain group condition ( , train detrain ) . The null hypothesis constant PC congruence median control group train group test non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis . Mann Whitney U match pairs test analysis also perform assess statistically significant difference couple different condition . Effect size ( Cohen 's ) compute demonstrate magnitude standardize median ' difference effect reach p &lt; .05 level .</detailed_description>
