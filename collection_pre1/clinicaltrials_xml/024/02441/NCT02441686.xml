	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate combination three drug call lenalidomide , subcutaneous ( injection skin ) bortezomib , dexamethasone ( RVD ) possible treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Efficacy Safety Lenalidomide , Subcutaneous Bortezomib Dexamethasone Therapy Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational combination drug learn whether combination drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve combination drug type cancer . Each individual drug , lenalidomide , subcutaneous bortezomib , dexamethasone , approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The combination approve yet multiple myeloma type cancer . Subcutaneous bortezomib currently approve U.S. FDA treatment patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . Lenalidomide currently approve use dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy treatment certain type myelodysplastic syndrome ( another form cancer affect blood ) . Both Bortezomib Lenalidomide kill tumor cell help body cell fight cancer . Dexamethasone commonly use , either alone , combination drug , treat multiple myeloma . Dexamethasone heps reduce irritation cell injury ( inflammation ) . In research study , investigator look explore drug combination lenalidomide , subcutaneous bortezomib dexamethasone see side effect may well work treatment newly diagnose multiple myeloma . This 3 drug regimen show promising result previous study , however administration intravenous bortezomib cause high level nerve injury ( condition involve nerve upper low extremity associate numbness , tingle burning ) . In study , investigator test hypothesis subcutaneous administration bortezomib result le nerve toxicity . Therefore , combination lenalidomide , dexamethasone subcutaneous bortezomib may well tolerate may allow long duration therapy .</detailed_description>
