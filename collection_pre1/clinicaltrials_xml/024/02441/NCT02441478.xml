	<brief_summary>Epilepsy frequent neurological disorder third patient seizures despite treatment . At least seizure link low compliance therapy adherence patient . Compliance define `` extent person 's behavior ( term take medication , follow diet , execute life style change ) coincide medical health advice '' . Therapy adherence patient suffer epilepsy low report rate 30 50 % , although adherence anticonvulsive drug therapy critical effective disease management low therapy adherence associate high mortality epilepsy . The reason low therapy adherence still matter research . Some known factor influence compliance epilepsy relate chronic nature , others seem lie complex interaction psychiatric comorbidity impairment neural system underlie behavior . Furthermore , therapy adherence rest variable difficult measure , especially epileptic patient classical tool questionnaires electronic monitoring device show imprecise . It argue term 'compliance ' replace 'co-operative behavior ' non-compliance therefore interpret troubled co-operative behavior . This behavioral approach offer potential use tool method late development behavioral neuroscience . Neuroeconomics , scientific field border psychology , economics neuroscience , use economic game paradigm order operationalize cooperative behavior identify several brain area functional brain imaging link social co-operative behavior . The majority brain area locate frontal cortex [ ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex , rostral anterior cingulate cortex . Epilepsies originate frontal lobe subsume term `` frontal lobe epilepsy '' ( FLE ) represent 20-30 % partial seizures 25 % refractory focal epilepsy refer epilepsy surgery . The investigator 's project plan study compliance cooperative behavior patient suffer frontal lobe epilepsy neuroeconomic approach ( 1 ) compare behavior patient prisoner ' dilemma game behavior age- , gender- , education-matched healthy control , ( 2 ) correlation game behavior brain activation measure functional magnetic resonance image patient healthy control ( 3 ) study link cooperative behavior compliance capture pill count questionnaire .</brief_summary>
