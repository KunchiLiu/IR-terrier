	<brief_summary>Children Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) increase year . There 1 160 child age group 6-12 year old Australia diagnose ASD . Children ASD impairment two common area include : ) social communication ii ) repetitive stereotypical pattern behaviour . These common feature result behavioural problem negatively impact child 's participation school , activity daily live social engagement . Therefore , need effective intervention overcome behavioural problem child ASD . The purpose study investigate effect sensory integration ( SI ) self-regulated learn versus activity-based control programme reduce behavioural problem child ASD interfere daily living , school , social engagement . The study adopt randomize controlled trial design three intervention group : I ) self-regulated learning , II ) sensory integration III ) activity-based intervention control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) commonly associate behavioural problem may negatively impact participation school , activity daily living social engagement . In order minimise impact daily function child , overcome behavioural problem child essential . Two intervention approach use study . These ) self-regulated learn ii ) sensory integration . Sensory integration commonly use child developmental problem . Self-regulated learning use promote child 's self-directed learning people brain injury . However , evidence towards effectiveness two intervention alleviate effect behavioural problem participation school , daily social activity child ASD limit inconclusive . Self-regulated learn theory : The origin self-regulated learning approach come Albert Bandura 's social cognitive theory . The theory state intervention affect one 's learn modifying personal , environmental behavioural factor . The personal factor refer one 's beliefs attitude . The environment factor comprise feedback , instruction , information gather teacher instructor also assistance parent peer . The behavioural factor include past performance socially unacceptable . The key self-regulated learning ensure child make use cognitive strategy facilitate behaviour learn help bring problem solution towards consciousness . Several study use self-regulated learning child adult population . It find significant improvement task performance child Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders ( ADHD ) . The positive effect also show another study show improvement performance measure read intelligence quotient among child moderate learn disability . Similar result also see adult brain injury various study . They suggest self-regulated learning could enhance active learning participant . Children ASD report commonly associate self-regulation problem affect behaviour learn ability . However , study use self-regulated learn group child alleviate effect behavioural problem school , daily social participation . Sensory integration intervention theory : Sensory integration theory develop 1960s 1970s . The theory develop target neurological process sensory information . The theory suggest purposeful behaviour may interrupt interference neurological processing integration sensory information . Sensory integration intervention widely use variety setting among child development problem . However , despite vast amount literature exist effectiveness sensory integration intervention , overall evidence effectiveness child ASD behavioural problem remain inconclusive . Some study show sensory integration effective intervention give positive result , others show benefit inconclusive finding . Studies previously use sensory integration intervention seem use fidelity measure intervention design ensure intervention met requirement sensory integration theory . This could one reason inconclusive find make effectiveness . Furthermore , study use single-case study design small sample size . In addition , previous study use sensory integration focus alleviate effect behavioural problem function daily living , school social engagement child ASD . This study , therefore , adopt randomise controlled trial ( RCT ) design investigate effect sensory integration self-regulated learning intervention ( compare activity-based control intervention ) reduce effect behavioural problem daily living , school social engagement child ASD .</detailed_description>
