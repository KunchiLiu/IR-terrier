	<brief_summary>Long-term weight loss maintenance seldom achieve individual obesity owe numerous biological adaptation involve appetite , satiety , energy expenditure post- weight loss set . Following loss body weight , peripheral central mechanism convey sense energy reserve dwindle , activate strong counter response increase caloric intake . Adolescents severe obesity immune vex issue weight regain . Indeed , 2 % able achieve maintain clinically-meaningful weight loss lifestyle modification therapy . Therefore , novel treatment paradigm focus long-term weight loss maintenance urgently need . Pharmacotherapy potential prevent weight regain target specific counter-regulatory mechanism post- weight loss setting . One promising candidate glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1RA ) class , greatly enhance weight loss maintenance follow short-term low calorie diet among adult obesity . The rationale focusing GLP-1RA treatment ( BYDUREON™ ) prevent weight regain support multiple central peripheral mechanism action target class drug ; many specifically address biological adaptation know induce relapse . The investigator strong preliminary data demonstrate GLP-1RA treatment reduces BMI adolescent severe obesity . Moreover , investigator others show although meal replacement therapy ( structured meal know caloric content ) elicit robust short-term weight loss among adolescent severe obesity , weight regain pervasive problem . Therefore , clinical trial , innovative approach utilize GLP-1RA treatment target weight regain follow short-term meal replacement therapy youth severe obesity . Participants achieve ≥5 % BMI reduction meal replacement phase randomize GLP-1RA treatment placebo additional 52 week simultaneously engage lifestyle modification therapy . Importantly , study also allow u examine extent GLP-1RA treatment address mechanism weight regain , investigate pleiotropic benefit GLP-1RA , identify predictor weight loss response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective Evaluate effect GLP-1RA treatment maintenance weight loss durability cardiometabolic risk factor improvement among adolescent severe obesity follow meal replacement induction period . The investigator hypothesize adolescent severe obesity receive GLP-1RA treatment follow short-term meal replacement induction period demonstrate superior maintenance initial BMI reduction 52 week follow randomization compare assign placebo ( primary endpoint ) high proportion assign GLP-1RA treatment vs. placebo maintain ≥5 % BMI reduction baseline 52-week time point ( secondary endpoint ) . Moreover , GLP-1RA treatment result superior maintenance initial reduction body fat ( total , visceral , subcutaneous ) , blood pressure , triglycerides/HDL ratio , inflammation , oxidative stress , postprandial glucose-insulin response , insulin resistance , β cell dysfunction , arterial stiffness 52 week . Secondary Objectives Investigate mechanisms GLP-1RA treatment facilitates weight loss maintenance identify predictor response treatment . The investigator hypothesize compare placebo , GLP-1RA treatment follow period meal replacement reduce appetite ( related hormone ) gastric empty rate , increase satiety ( related hormone ) rest energy expenditure 26- 52 week follow randomization . Moreover , base preliminary work , investigator hypothesize appetite ( appetite-related hormone ) follow meal replacement period female gender associate superior weight loss maintenance GLP-1RA treatment .</detailed_description>
