	<brief_summary>Background : High risk patient lung disease undergo cardiac surgery significant risk postoperative complication lead prolonged hospital stay . One method reduce risk lung complication treat patient non-invasive ventilation continuous positive airway pressure postoperatively . However , often require admission high dependency unit intensive care , uncomfortable need tight fit mask , well labour intensive costly . Nasal high flow oxygen ( Optiflow™ ) new alternative provide warmed humidify oxygen high flow , also show assist breathe improve recovery . It comfortable use indeed may comfortable standard ( dry ) oxygen via facemask ( Hudson type ) nasal prong . It may administer normal ward , however routine use high risk patient lung condition asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , recent chest infection heavy smoker test . Aims/Objectives : The primary aim clinical trial determine prophylactic nasal high flow oxygen ( Optiflow™ ) therapy cardiac surgical patient high-risk develop post-operative pulmonary complication associate short hospital length stay . Methods : High risk adult patient schedule undergo cardiac surgery recruit full ethical approval inform consent . Before surgery , patient perform 6- minute walk test supervision physiotherapist . This simple test measure far patient walk 6 minute . Additionally , patient undergo spirometry test use assess well lungs work measure much air patient inhales exhales quickly exhale . Patients thereafter undergo surgery general anaesthesia would normally . After operation look following recovery protocol , incorporate pain relief , regular physiotherapy , early mobilisation eat drinking , removal chest drain tube soon possible . On arrival critical care area surgery , patient randomly assign receive supplemental oxygen via soft facemask ( Hudson Type ) ( standard group ) , via high-flow nasal cannulae ( Optiflow™ ) ( intervention group ) . Patients administer oxygen least 24 hour surgery . Patients develop breathe difficulty receive treatment base clinical need . On fifth sixth postoperative day repeat walk test spirometry . The investigator use short questionnaire determine difference patient feel recover leave hospital quickly return normal activity discharge , also evaluate tolerate either facemask ( Hudson Type ) high flow nasal cannulae ( Optiflow™ ) . The investigator use data previous study calculate total 74 patient need take part , order evaluate whether high flow nasal oxygen ( Optiflow™ ) lead reduced length hospital stay high risk cardiac surgery compare usual care oxygen therapy .</brief_summary>
