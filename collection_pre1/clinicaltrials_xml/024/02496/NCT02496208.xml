	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-s-malate Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Genitourinary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination cabozantinib ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) nivolumab ( cabo-nivo ) separately combination cabozantinib , nivolumab ipilimumab ( cabo-nivo-ipi ) patient genitourinary tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Preliminarily evaluate activity , determine objective response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 modify Immune-Related Response Criteria ( irRC ) , derive RECIST1.1 , cabo-nivo cabo-nivo-ipi patient advanced/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( checkpoint inhibition therapy naive ) renal cell carcinoma second-line beyond set . II . Preliminarily evaluate activity , determine objective response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 modify Immune-Related Response Criteria ( irRC ) , derive RECIST1.1 , cabo-nivo patient adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma bladder first line beyond set . III . Preliminarily evaluate activity , determine objective response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 modify Immune-Related Response Criteria ( irRC ) , derive RECIST1.1 , cabo-nivo patient urothelial carcinoma previously treat checkpoint inhibition therapy second line beyond set . IV . To evaluate activity determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) : cabo-nivo cabo-nivo-ipi patient advanced/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( checkpoint inhibition therapy naive ) renal cell carcinoma second-line beyond set . V. To evaluate activity determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) : cabo-nivo patient advance adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma bladder first-line beyond set . VI . To evaluate activity determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) : cabo-nivo patient urothelial carcinoma previously treat checkpoint inhibition therapy second line beyond set . VII . To obtain additional data evaluate safety combination patient clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) . VIII . To assess number malignant soft tissue bone lesion fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) ( scan 1 ) versus combine fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride ( 18F-NaF ) 18F-FDG PET/CT ( scan 2 ) . IX . To assess response assessment RECIST 1.1 use CT chest , abdomen , pelvis intravenous ( IV ) contrast versus assessment combine 18F-NaF 18F-FDG PET/CT ( scan 2 ) use number malignant change ( modify PET RECIST [ PERCIST ] ) soft tissue bone lesion . X . To test feasibility automate density volume application ( ADaVA ) mean assess tumor response . XI . To assess PDL-1 MET expression data exploratory fashion analyze association response clinical benefit . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . PART I : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate PO QD day 1-21 , nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 , ipilimumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 4 course ipilimumab , patient continue receive cabozantinib-s-malate PO QD day 1-28 nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 42 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 16 week 100 day every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
