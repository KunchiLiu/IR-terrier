	<brief_summary>This open-label whole-body PET/CT study investigation radiation dosimetry , plasma pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , safety diagnostic performance 68Ga-NEB healthy volunteer patient suspected infection . Changes routine blood urine test adverse event collect volunteer . Adverse event also observe patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Translation Novel Albumin-Binding PET Radiotracer 68Ga-NEB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The labeling albumin advantage draw blood unnecessary operator label expose potentially infectious material . Evans blue ( EB ) dye high affinity serum albumin , The final obtain product NEB ( NOTA conjugate truncate form Evans blue vivo albumin label ) proceed strict quality control . No fasting , hydration specific preparation request day image . Patients blood pool imaging underwent whole-body PET/CT acquisition 30-45 min intravenous injection 111-148 MBq ( 3-4 mCi ) 68Ga-NEB bed position last 2 min standard routine 18F-FDG PET/CT within one week . Patients lymph node image include breast nodule patient underwent standard routine 18F-FDG PET/CT first , locally inject 10~20MBq 68Ga-NEB , follow dynamic chest regional PET acquisition . A Siemens MMWP workstation use post-processing . Visual analysis use determine general biodistribution temporal intersubject stability . Semiquantitative method apply image analysis .</detailed_description>
