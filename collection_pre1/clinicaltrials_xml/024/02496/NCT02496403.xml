IOT predominant model care specialty treatment , incorporate psychosocial support , 12-step , educational relapse-prevention base approach . The investigator recruit 300 adult patient induct onto bup/nx , randomize either SMM IOT , conduct telephone follow-up interview 6 12 month .

Further , investigator examine whether effect IOT versus SMM adherence SU treatment outcomes great medical psychiatric co-morbidities . This innovative approach include focus complex patient psychiatric medical co-morbidities specialty care , adapt care model previously test primary care , 12-month follow-up , research-forced medication taper , examination health care societal cost , combination patient self-report electronic medical record data .

	<detailed_description>The study contrast compare effectiveness cost two form behavioral SU treatment service total 300 opioid dependent patient seek bup/nx treatment Kaiser Sacramento Chemical Dependency Recovery Program ( CDRP ) . The design between-groups clinical trial use block randomization two treatment ( IOT SMM ) analyse base intent-to-treat model . Patients recruit study randomize induction time program intake . A full battery background , concurrent status diagnostic information collect baseline , repeat 6 12 month later assess change drug use , 30 day 6-month abstinence , quality life point . The study test illicit drug use presence buprenorphine random urinalysis throughout treatment . In addition urinalysis , bup/nx adherence measure use prescription drug refill self-report . Investigators collect self-report prescription opioid use abstinence . Finally , number type service receive treatment available EMR .

The average daily dose bup/nx range 12-24mg , typically 16 mg. After induction , patient schedule intake interview admission treatment program . Following intake session , research staff member describe study ass eligibility criterion . For patient agree participate , research associate proceed enroll patient private room . During enrollment/baseline appointment , research associate obtain informed consent administer baseline questionnaire use laptop computer ( see ) . Patients randomize either IOT SMM arm use block randomization procedure ensure equal number patient assign treatment arm . Patients unwilling unable randomize meet intake therapist treat standard manner designate treatment program 's regular intake counselor , part study . At baseline , follow recruitment consent , participant complete computerize interview private place CDRP ( research associate available computer content question ) . A full battery background , physical mental health SU disorder information collect . Study investigator conduct two follow-up telephone interview whether patient complete CDRP treatment program . At follow-up , participant remind study permission conduct interview obtain verbally . Interviews conduct 6 12 month research staff baseline measure assess treatment adherence , substance use abstinence , quality life . Also , patient ask present CDRP within 48 hour 6 12 month interview urine test additional brief question drug use .</detailed_description>
