	<detailed_description>The goal study compare common method tissue extraction time minimally invasive surgery , include vaginal extraction mini-laparotomy ; perform within containment system . The primary aim assess return normal daily activity surgical technique . Return daily activity record post-operative patient activity diary recording follow task : ) work ( applicable ) , b ) domestic task , c ) drive vehicle ( applicable ) ) physical exercise ( applicable ) . Additional information regard post-operative pain ( measure Likert scale ) , potential complication technique , tear bag leakage , peri- post-operative outcome collect . In order aid detection leakage , blue dye ( either indigo carmine methylene blue ) add containment bag prior morcellation .</detailed_description>
