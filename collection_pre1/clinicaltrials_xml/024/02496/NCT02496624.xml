	<brief_summary>The Guided Therapeutics ( GTx ) program University Health Network network clinician , scientist , engineer focus development translation image-guided technology focus minimally-invasive , adaptive therapy . Technologies develop within GTx program include portable intra-operative cone-beam CT ( collaboration Siemens ) evaluate clinical trial head neck surgery . The intraoperative imaging integrate track navigational tool optical image provide general `` surgical dashboard '' use improve accuracy surgical resection . A recent addition GTx program development GTx OR , locate within general operating room Toronto General Hospital . The GTx OR house 2 complimentary advance technology : Siemens Zeego Siemens Somotom Flash CT . The dual-energy Somatom Flash provide `` gold-standard '' CT imaging , Zeego provide excellent 3D Cone-beam CT robotic placement flexible integration within operating environment . Together , integration 2 component single OR enable critical evaluation limit CT image technology surgical guidance . This study conduct use solely Cone-beam CT ( Zeego ) percutaneous placement localization marker resection small pulmonary nodule VATS .</brief_summary>
