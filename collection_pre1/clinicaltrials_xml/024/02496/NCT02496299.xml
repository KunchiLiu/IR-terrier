	<brief_title>Effect Dexamethasone Added To Bupivacaine During Caudal Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN . The study prospective study . All patient randomize two group , B BD . In group B , patient receive 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25 % ( maximum volume = 20 ml ) . In group BD , patient receive mixture 0.2 mg/kg dexamethasone 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25 % ( maximum volume = 20 ml ) . The total volume inject 1 ml/kg patient . RESEARCH SETTING . The study take place Gbagada , Alimosho Ifako Ijaye General Hospitals Lagos . They secondary health care facility 800 bed space Gbagada , 400 Alimosho 300 Ifako Ijaye . General Hospital Gbagada establish 1983 situate Gbagada , Alimosho 2006 , situate Igando Ifako ijaye create 2005 located Ifako . These three area densely populate suburbs Lagos . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION . The minimum sample size study calculate formula 21 n= z 2 x p x q d2 Assuming 95 % interval , 5 % level precision proportion 90 % 21 . Where n =minimum sample size Z =a constant ( 1.96 ; ) percentage point standard normal deviation correspond 95 % confidence interval . P =proportion patient positive dexamethasone analgesic effect obtain past study . ( 90 % ) 21 Q = complimentary probability ; equivalent ( 1-p ) =predetermined level precision equivalent 5 % n= ( 1.96 ) 2 x 0.90 x.055 0.05 =76.0 approximate 80 Sample size increase 20 % provide attrition=16 Therefore , sample size 80+16=96 RANDOMIZATION After local ethic committee approval write informed consent obtain parent legal guardian , 96 patient undergoing elective unilateral inguinal herniotomy select prospective randomized-controlled trial . Patients would distribute two equal group : group B ( n = 48 ) , caudal block perform use bupivacaine , group BD ( n = 48 ) , caudal block perform use dexamethasone add bupivacaine . The distribution simple randomization method use computer generate random number . Numbers 1-96 randomly distribute two group group total 48 patient . ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT MECHANISM The patient see least day surgery preoperative assessment . All patient would fast accord AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGY ( ASA ) guideline ( 2 h clear fluid ; 4 h breast milk ; 6 h formula milk light meal ) . No premedication administer informed write consent form fill parent guardian adequate explanation scope study parent guardian old child case may . All patient routine investigation perform . There two resident recruit research assistants.Post emergence , first , assistant ( also unaware group allocation ) observe patient recovery room post operatively hence method pain assessment post operatively discuss research assistant . The second research assistant assign participant intervention prepares drug . This assistant stay outside operating room within theatre environ hold key code . Using sealed envelope technique , number 1-96 place envelope research assistant allow patient parent legal guardian randomly pick number . The research assistant compare computer generate random sequence determine group patient belongs . Both patient investigator blind allocation . All drug prepare aseptically research assistant . The assistant would prepare drug . On arrival operating room , routine standard monitor would apply ( Electrocardiograph , noninvasive blood pressure , pulse oximetry ) baseline vital sign take . General anesthesia would induce investigator ( unaware group allocation ) incremental dose halothane 0.5- 2 % 100 % oxygen . After induction anesthesia , intravenous line would place , follow insertion appropriately sized laryngeal mask airway secure tape . When adequate depth anesthesia attain , anesthesia would maintain use isoflurane 1-2 % 100 % oxygen . No muscle relaxant administer patient would breathe spontaneously use Mapleson F till end surgery . After properly secure laryngeal mask airway , patient turn left lateral position . Under complete aseptic condition caudal block perform use 25-G short bevel needle . Correct placement needle confirm characteristic 'pop ' felt sacrococcygeal membrane penetrate . The stilet remove plastic cannula secure . Correct placement epidural space confirm absence cerebrospinal fluid flow absence swell injection drug occur subcutaneous insertion . The investigator , anesthesiologist performing block would blind identity drug use epidural injectate patient would present 20 mls syringe contain 20mls colourless , odourless , non-particulate solution investigator performer caudal block give dose 1ml/kg . The code B BD know research assistant prepare drug discloses code end study event adverse reaction drug use study . The end injection take zero time . Surgery would commence 10 min block perform allow drug take effect . A standardized intraoperative fluid therapy use patient ( 10 ml/kg/h normal saline solution ) . Mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , arterial oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) would record use non invasive blood pressure monitor pulse oxymetry induction every 5 min induction anesthesia till end surgery . During intraoperative period , adequacy analgesia would assess hemodynamic stability , would define absence increase 20 % HR MAP compare pre incision value . An increase 20 % HR MAP would consider indication inadequate analgesia manage bolus dose intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg , follow dos intravenous diclofenac 1mg/kg need . The need intraoperative analgesic would recorded.Such patient consider part attrition . At end surgery , isoflurane switch LMA extubated patient awake . Emergence time ( time end surgery open eye call patient name ) delay anesthetic emergence ( consider 20 minute elapsed end surgery exit operate theatre ) note . After recovery , patient able maintain patent airway , would transfer recovery room , remain least 2 h transfer ward . Post operative pain hemodynamic variable ( MAP HR ) would record recovery room every 30 min till patient discharge ward 3 hour . Postoperative pain assess use modify Objective Pain Score ( mOPS ) every 30 min first 2 h 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 h postoperatively . This score include five criterion : cry , agitation , movement , posture , localization pain . Each criterion assign score 0 2 , 2 bad , yield possible total score 0-10 [ 5 ] . If mOPS score 4 , rescue analgesia form paracetamol 15 mg/kg orally would administer . Further bolus paracetamol 15 mg/kg would administer orally every 4 h require . Residual motor block sedation level also assess 30 min 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 h surgery . Motor block assess use modify Bromage scale consist four point [ 0 = full motor strength ( flexion knees foot ) , 1 = flexion knee , 2 = little movement foot , 3 = movement knee foot ] [ 29 ] . The sedation score ; assess use four-point scale ( 1 , alert aware ; 2 , asleep , arousable verbal contact ; 3 , asleep , arousable physical contact ; 4 , asleep , arousable ) . After transfer ward , rescue analgesia consumption , pain score , occurrence postoperative vomit first 24h surgery record . Any complication include itching , urine retention ( void urine 6 hour postoperative ) , respiratory depression ( respiratory rate &lt; 10 breaths/min ) , hypotension ( MAP decrease &gt; 20 % baseline ) , bradycardia ( HR decrease &gt; 20 % baseline ) would record research assistant 24 hour . Any undesirable effect treat follow ; shiver , patient cover , give warm intravenous fluid , theatre room temperature increase , itch ; intravenous chlorpheniramine give , metoclopramide vomit , urinary retention catheter pass . The time first supplemental oral paracetamol end surgery first modify objective pain score great equal 4 record . The time first micturition post caudal block incidence bladder catheterization would also record . The postoperative data recovery room would record second research assistant mention , second research assistant mention , resident also blind drug use caudal block . The assistant would patient recovery room least 3 hour transfer ward . MEASUREMENT Data collect use data collection form design investigator . Patients ' blood pressure measure noninvasive blood pressure monitor , heart rate arterial oxygen saturation ( SPO2 ) measure pulse oximeter respiratory rate count . These vital sign record 2 minute , 5 minute thereafter 10 minute interval throughout course surgery . DRUGS All drug use study license clinical use Nigeria include : 0.25 % plain bupivacaine , dexamethasone , chlorpheniramine , atropine , paracetamol diclofenac . All drug provide researcher . PERIOD OF STUDY This study do period 3-6 month DATA MANAGEMENT Based calculation sample size , 96 patient would In 2 group 48 patient . Data collection do proforma section A-D DATA ANALYSIS Data analyse use statistic package social science ( SPSS ) version 15 Demographic variable represent table chart summary statistic do mean proportion . Test association categorical variable do use chi square . Test association quantity do use test anova . Level statistical significance set p value &lt; 0.05</detailed_description>
