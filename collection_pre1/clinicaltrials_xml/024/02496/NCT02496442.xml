	<detailed_description>1.0 Purpose Investigation 1.1 Name investigational device : Aqueduct model CIS-01 1.2 Intended use investigational device : Automatic Continuous Irrigation Endoscopic procedure . 1.3 Objectives clinical investigation : 1.3.1 Primary objective . Demonstrating efficacy use Aqueduct system : - Continuity flow - Ease operation 1.3.2 Secondary objective ( ) . - Evaluation potential safety issue associate use device ; - Evaluation device design ; - Assessing certain human factor ( e.g. , patient operator ) associate use device ; - Other specified device characteristic device application consideration . 1.4 Anticipated duration clinical investigation : 1 Month 2.0 Clinical Protocol 2.1 Title clinical protocol : Operation automatic irrigation controller endoscopic procedures 2.1.1 Protocol number . Version 01 2.1.2 Version number date . Version 1 , March 4 , 2015 2.2 Study design : 2.2.1 General study design . During study system use surgeon teach system capability , feel correct . Surgeons setup system supply solution flow limiting pressure . Increase flow operation require limit set pressure safety valve 180 cmH2O . Following procedure case report form ( attach chapter 11 ) fill , report single experiment result . Both case use system standard procedure use report summarized table . The result serve analyze equipment performance efficacy . 2.3 Subject selection : 2.3.1 General characteristic propose subject population ( ) . Regular endoscopic procedure patient ( ) . There difference standard procedure use Aqueduct . Only improvements without risk expect . 2.3.2 Anticipated number research subject . Up 30 patient enrolled experiment . They sign consent form explain experiment 2.3.3 Inclusion criterion . Any adult age 18 candidate endoscopic procedure suitable experiment 2.3.4 Exclusion criterion . Only adults age 18 . 2.4 Study procedure : 2.4.1 Screening procedure . The surgeon perform operation suggest use Aqueduct relevant patient . He explain principle system advantage risk mitigation . If patient agrees sign consent form enrol . 2.4.2 Study treatment diagnostic product procedure . The study include series procedure surgeon utilize Aqueduct irrigation instead use current bag pole . The surgeon inspect parameter setting Aqueduct , experiment value may ease procedure . In general try minimal flow minimal pressure use efficiently . If need able increase decrease flow limiting pressure . In subsequent procedure surgeon use setting achieve previous procedure . After 10 procedure collect best setting future default setup Aqueduct procedure . 2.4.3 Follow-up procedure . 2.4.3.1 Procedures assess efficacy : As standard procedure call gravitational flow 60 Cm patient , create free flow 350 270 milliliter per minute nominal pressure 60 cm H2O , efficacy prove following : 1 . Nominal flow 300ml/min 2 . Nominal pressure 60cm H2O As low result less risk patient . 2.4.3.2 Procedures assess safety : Closing input tap resectoscope lead operation pressure relief valve 180 cm H2O show protection achieve overpressure . 2.4.4 Schedule activity ( Study Table ) . Incorporated referenced attachment table summarize protocol procedure perform screen , treatment diagnosis , follow-up . 2.5 Study outcome evaluation : 2.5.1 Study endpoint . After procedure surgeon fill protocol summary ( per attachment chapter 11 ) : observation 1 . If continuous flow maintain procedure 2 . If ease use equipment acceptable 3 . Any ideas improvement next system generation The study endpoint least 10 procedure use Aqueduct . The secondary objective satisfy ideas improvement next system generation . 2.5.2 Sample size determination . There need perform clinical trial . The justification sample size select estimated time need evaluate system . 2.5.3 Outcome data data analysis . Average observation and/or measurement result use system efficiently primary result experiment . The , secondary result outcomes clinical study suggestion improvement . The result use reach production model Aqueduct . 3.0 Risk Analysis 3.1 Anticipated risk : Risks patient limited system extract overpressure organ operate . The step take reduce risk triple 1 . Set system low parameter pressure value use current procedure 2 . A pressure sensor incorporate within Y-Set provide pressure reading prevent overpressure . 3 . In case system failure control low pressure mechanical safety valve set 180 cm H2O prevents risk large pressure . 4 . During operation pressure read appear screen warn message appear surgeon decide stop use Aqueduct move standard procedure . The system design ease transfer solution bag Y-Set standard gravitational activate pole . Since overpressure immediately detect acted upon real risk benefit patient . The benefit assess % flow average 330ml/min without system % pressure minimal 60 cmH2O use standard procedure . 3.2 Adverse event recording/reporting 3.2.1 Adverse event definition . Adverse effect .
