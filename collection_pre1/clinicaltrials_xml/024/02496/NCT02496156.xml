	<detailed_description>Abstract ( modify achievement Aims 1 2 ) : Treatment adherence type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) tend decline among adolescent , increase risk acute chronic complication , excess health care use , poorer quality life , T1D-related family conflict . Poor adherence associate psychiatric family dysfunction often persist early adulthood . Therapeutic advance continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII `` insulin pump '' ) continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) could improve metabolic control quality life . But , teen often benefit fully advance . Many study adults show patient-centered communication style predict favorable clinical outcome . Shared medical decision making ( SMDM ) intervention improve outcome among adult diabetes condition . Research pediatrics also show patient-centered family-centered communication style predict favorable outcome , research primary care study youth chronic condition . Since control trial SMDM chronically ill youth , propose randomize controlled trial SMDM intervention compare Usual Clinical Practice ( UCP ) . Qualitative interview youth parent previously face decision reliance expert consultant , pediatric endocrinologist diabetes educator precede trial provide value input refine plan intervention adapt structure SMDM format pediatrics . Now , recruit randomize 166 11- &lt; 17 year old youth T1D candidate CSII CGM ( parent/caregiver ) Nemours sit . The SMDM intervention deliver via web-based platform , facilitate Diabetes Educators ( DEs ) site standardize , yet individually tailored format . SMDM employ multimedia `` decision aid '' prepare award-winning Nemours Center Children 's Health Media `` e-city interactive '' web design firm Philadelphia accord pertinent international standard . SMDM also include individualized assistance DE assure youth 's parent 's preference , value cultural belief carefully address communicated attend endocrinologist . After baseline evaluation randomization SMDM UCP , effect primary outcome ( treatment adherence ; device utilization ) secondary outcome ( glycemic control , treatment alliance , decision conflict regret , treatment satisfaction , diabetes-related distress self-efficacy ) measure 1 year . Mixed effect model primary analytic technique evaluate effect primary/secondary outcome , examine select variable moderator mediator treatment effect , assess whether effect comparable two medical decision interest . The result verify whether SMDM context enhances treatment adherence , device use parent/patient-reported outcome youth T1D .</detailed_description>
