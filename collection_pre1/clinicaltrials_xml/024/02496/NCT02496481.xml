	<brief_title>A Brief MI Intervention ED Increase Child Passenger Restraint Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor vehicle collision ( MVCs ) remain leading cause death among child first year life despite substantial improvement passenger safety . Deaths severe injury MVCs reduce significantly consistent use size-appropriate child passenger restraint . Still , 10 % child ride completely unrestrained roughly one-quarter use recommend restraint size . New approach need motivate behavior change among parent consistently use size-appropriate passenger restraint child birth age 10 . Emergency department ( ED ) visit represent unique opportunity reach vulnerable child parent difficulty access primary care setting childhood injury prevention information commonly provide . Motivational interviewing ( MI ) ED use encourage variety health behavior among at-risk patient . However , MI previously evaluate child passenger safety promotion program . This study involve ED-based intervention utilize MI technique patient-centered ( e.g. , tailor ) print material promote correct consistent use size-appropriate child passenger restraint . This study design randomize pilot trial intervention utilize 2x2 factorial design examine independent additive effect ED-based MI tailor print material consistent use size-appropriate child passenger restraint . Aim 1 ) To assess feasibility acceptability ED-based intervention among parent child birth age 10 ; Aim 2 ) To determine impact intervention child passenger restraint attitude practice 6-month follow-up comparison baseline assessment .</detailed_description>
