Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude participation program meet one follow exclusion criterion : 1 . Patient geographic access qualifies enrollment ( determine Sponsor Investigator ) Alexionsponsored clinical trial asfotase alfa open enrollment ( eg , ENB01010 ) . 2 . Patient pregnant , try become pregnant , lactate . 3 . Patient document sensitivity component asfotase alfa . 4 . Patient serum calcium and/or phosphorus level normal range Screening . 5 . Patient currently enrol program study involve investigational new drug , device , treatment HPP ( eg , bone marrow transplantation ) . 6 . Patient medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , may significantly interfere program compliance , include evaluation followup activity . Patients previously receive treatment asfotase alfa may consider enrollment .</criteria>
