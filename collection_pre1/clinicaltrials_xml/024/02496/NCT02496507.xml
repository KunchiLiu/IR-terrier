	<brief_title>A Mixed-methods Evaluation Sit-stand Workstations Office Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Treatment arm two-arm parallel-group randomise control trial ( RCT ) include sit-stand workstation intervention group ( participant receive sit-stand workstation ) control group ( usual practice ) . Recruitment - Organisation level Office worker one organisation target research team August-September 2013 . Consent seek 11 departmental manager employee recruitment , installation sit-stand workstation , study contact laboratory visit work time . Departments locate across four building vary office layout ( open-plan , individual office combination ) . Employees within targeted department predominantly administrative staff . - Individual level Via email research team , employee consent department receive overview study participant information sheet , invite study information session ( two session organise per department ) . Employees give 2 week express interest . Interested employee screen eligibility use state criterion research team via telephone . If inclusion criterion meet , write informed consent obtain baseline assessment schedule . There racial gender bias selection participant . Group assignment Intervention Following baseline assessment , participant assign one member research team treatment arm use randomised block design random number table . Departments serve block participant within department randomly assign individual-level arm . Assignment individual participant within department alternate arm ( i.e . intervention , control , intervention , control… ) . Data collection At baseline , 4 week ( mid-intervention ) 8 week ( end-intervention ) , participant ' office-based behaviour assess via ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) diary . At baseline 8 week , participant attend University laboratory morning individual assessment state outcomes . Prior laboratory visit , participant require fast minimum 8 hour , avoid consumption alcohol 12 hour , avoid strenuous exercise 24 hour . Sample size Allowing small drop , study aim recruit 25 participant per arm , retain 23 participant per arm . A sample size 23 per arm chosen priori achieve 90 % power ( alpha 5 % ; two-tailed ) detect minimum difference 60 minutes/8-hour workday arm workplace sit time ( primary outcome : expect SD 60 minutes/day ) . Data collection vascular metabolic outcomes would provide effect size estimate power calculation subsequent trial . Statistical analysis - Data analyse use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 22 ( IBM , New York , USA ) alpha level set p≤0.05 . Intervention effect compare 4 week ( sit , stand walk ) 8 week ( outcome ) baseline use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . The variable change score ( 4 8 week minus baseline ) dependent variable , intervention arm ( control v intervention ) independent variable . In analysis , covariates baseline value variable control imbalance baseline . Anthropometric , sociodemographic , work-related office-environment characteristic test potential confounders outcome . Confounders enter covariates significant association ( p≤0.05 ) observe change outcome effect mean difference group exceed 20 % . For change sit , stand walking time , baseline value two behaviour test potential confounders , though effect mean difference group exceed 20 % . Adjusted change score 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) difference change group present unless state otherwise . Acceptability feasibility data report median quartile . - Missing data Intention-to-treat analysis Due participant withdrawal , lose EMA diary inability conduct assessment , data miss outcome . Accordingly , per-protocol analysis conduct participant excluded analysis outcomes miss data . For workplace sitting , stand walking , per-protocol analysis compare intention-to-treat analysis , sensitivity analysis . To treat miss data , fully conditional imputation technique ten imputation set use due low rate miss data . Imputation base 47 randomized participant . - Minimum important difference analysis Inferential statistic run use minimum clinically important difference principle , describe elsewhere . Briefly , approach make inference base meaningful magnitude recommend alongside hypothesis test . A spreadsheet compute quantitative qualitative probability true effect beneficial , trivial harmful , outcome statistic , p value , smallest/minimal important difference enter . Minimum important difference sit stand 60 minutes/day , walk 10 minutes/day . Minimum important difference outcomes determine distribution-based method Cohen 's ( standardized difference change score group ) 0.2 between-subjects standard deviation ( SDs ) . The SD pool baseline data use negate possibility individual difference intervention influence SD 8 week . For effect 8 week , quantitative probability benefit , trivial harm , qualitative descriptor report . Effects interpret unclear probability benefit harm &gt; 5 % .</detailed_description>
