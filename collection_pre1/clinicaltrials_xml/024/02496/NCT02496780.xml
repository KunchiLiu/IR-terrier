	<brief_title>The Impact Insulin Therapy Protein Turnover Pre-Diabetic Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin insufficiency relate pancreatic fibrosis β-cell dysfunction present almost every cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient . Progressive abnormality insulin secretion begin childhood , , adult , CF relate diabetes ( CFRD ) eventually present half CF population . CFRD associate weight loss , protein catabolism , loss lean body mass ( LBM ) , early death lung disease malnutrition . The negative consequence diabetes `` tip iceberg '' , since clinical deterioration document begin pre-diabetic period . Non-diabetic glucose tolerance abnormality CF associate protein catabolism , weight loss lung function decline , correlate severity insulin secretory defect , suggest key pathologic role insulin insufficiency . Insulin potent anabolic hormone , critical maintenance body weight muscle mass . In placebo-controlled clinical trial , insulin therapy improve body mass index ( BMI ) LBM patient early CFRD ( CFRD without fast hyperglycemia ) , standard care patient . There grow preliminary evidence insulin therapy beneficial even earlier , CF patient pre-diabetes due insulin insufficiency . Given universal prevalence insulin insufficiency CF , high lifetime risk develop diabetes , clinical impact insulin insufficiency protein catabolism survival CF , critical importance maintain body weight LBM population , urgent need determine whether insulin replacement therapy institute anabolic purpose prior actual onset diabetes , , ascertain optimal regimen . The current protocol describe double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine whether insulin therapy improve protein catabolism youth CF abnormal glucose tolerance , explore difference efficacy multiple daily pre-meal insulin dosing ( currently standard early CFRD ) versus convenient daily basal insulin dose ( use small uncontrolled pilot study ) . The finding study provide mechanistic rationale institute insulin youth CF pre-diabetes , inform research study clinical practice best regimen insulin delivery population .</detailed_description>
