	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) occur excess fat deposit liver . Almost patient also obesity insulin resistance ( inability body effectively use insulin ) . Obesity NAFLD intricately intertwine increase incidence . While weight loss effective therapy NAFLD , investigator ' effort fail next generation become common cause liver failure Canada . Recently , researcher focus potential use alter composition bacteria gut ( microbiome ) alter absorption energy food , deposition fat resistance insulin . This study determine transplantation bacteria stool healthy volunteer individual metabolic syndrome NAFLD ( i.e . fecal microbiota transplant/FMT ) alter insulin resistance reduce amount fat deposit liver . FMT study treat several clinical condition standard care treatment refractory Clostridium difficile infection . Investigators propose randomize control pilot study FMT 21 patient determine feasibility inform u change need large study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity obesity-related disorder metabolic syndrome , Type 2 Diabetes ( DM2 ) , NAFLD increase concern worldwide . Metabolic syndrome refers cluster 3 5 parameter - abdominal obesity , elevate blood pressure , elevate fast glucose , elevate triglyceride level , low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) level . The prevalence metabolic syndrome approximately 20-25 % North America . Those metabolic syndrome increase risk DM2 cardiovascular disease . Metabolic syndrome , DM2 NAFLD mark insulin resistance intricately link obesity . NAFLD currently common liver disease develop country Canada . About 10-20 % patient NAFLD progress non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) characterize inflammation fat deposition . Unfortunately , NASH major cause cirrhosis North America . Gut Microbiota , Obesity , DM2 , NAFLD Very strong support hypothesis gut microbiome induce insulin resistance find recent randomize control trial show fecal transplantation lean healthy donor human patient metabolic syndrome result improved insulin sensitivity . This improvement correlate increase prevalence butyrate-producing bacteria . Since butyrate help prevent programmed cell death mucosal cell colon , preserve integrity intestinal mucosa may prevent migration endotoxin gut liver induction insulin resistance . Larger metagenome wide association study fecal microbiome confirm find butyrate-producing bacteria include Clostridiales spp , C . rectales , Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , Roseburia intestinalis R.inulinvorans appear less prevalent DM2 healthy control . Differences microbiome obese patient DM2 versus normal body mass index report many publication . There evidence alter flora increase efficiency release calorie food . In study obese human twin , decrease Bacteroidetes proportion increase Firmicutes proportion correlate enrichment microbial gene encode key enzyme involve carbohydrate metabolism , potentially lead increase digestion food supply energy form short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) host . Transfer gut microbiota obese mouse obese human germ-free mouse reproduce obese phenotype . Differences microbiota composition even document child obesity child lean , suggest microbiota change may occur early life . Decrease ratio number firmicutes/bacteroidetes associate weight loss human . Other human gut organism Akkermansia muciniphilia Enterobacter cloaca B29 implicate obesity DM2 . A high concentration gut Beta proteobacteria associate development diabetes possibly via inflammatory response incite endotoxin within Gram negative rod . In fact antibiotic administration animal model lead reduced number aerobic anaerobic bacteria increase insulin sensitivity well plasma adiponectin level , correlate insulin sensitivity . Changes gut microbiota associate obesity find activate Toll like receptor thus GI inflammation result insulin resistance . Very recently find artificial sweetener despite `` no-calorie '' exacerbate glucose intolerance , effect mediate via change microbiome . Compared healthy control simple steatosis patient , patient NASH low percentage phylum Bacteroidetes , find similar gut microbial flora obese human subject . Microbial fermentation product like ethanol gut key factor induce obesity mouse may relate pathogenesis fatty liver disease . Elevated systemic ethanol level even absence ethanol ingestion note patient NASH compare control , suggest ethanol-producing microbe might relate pathogenesis NASH humans.Certain microbiomes also lead high monosaccharide absorption gut lumen , promote de novo fatty acid triglyceride production liver . It find hepatic kupffer cell activation mouse seem contribute pathogenesis NAFLD induce microbial endotoxin-related chronic inflammation . Chronic endotoxemia associate severity NAFLD . Increased intestinal permeability similarly document DM2 metabolic syndrome likely play key role pathophysiology disorder . Overall finding suggest preventive therapeutic intervention fecal transplantation may lead improvement status obesity , metabolic syndrome , NASH NAFLD , possibly even atherosclerosis . Fecal Microbial Transplantation use extensively humans recurrent C.difficile infection find safe , effective well tolerate . Frozen stool find equally safe effective fresh stool transplant . This procedure become well accepted consider standard practice patient recurrent C.difficile , include new practice guideline . Its use metabolic syndromes new , safety data much large experience patient C.difficile reassure . Goal : â€¢ To determine impact alteration gut microbiome parameter insulin resistance liver fat content . Rationale : As mention background review extensive animal also moderately extensive human study demonstrate alteration microbiome associate metabolic syndrome NAFLD . There also extensive biochemical rationale microbiome change could lead change metabolic outcome human . Justification Innovation : The inability exist therapy control weight gain , obesity associate liver diseases individual metabolic disorder major public health concern . The potential gut microbial alteration prevent control metabolic disorder ( duplicate success FMT Clostridium difficile infection ) would important advance . This proof concept study enable targeted innovation gut microbiome control metabolic syndrome NAFLD .</detailed_description>
