	<brief_title>Protective Effect Statin Sleep Deprivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In set earthquake , flood , fire disaster , rescue worker usually carry work without sleep . Sleep deprivation ( SD ) , strong stressor , exert large effect cardiovascular system rescue worker . It report SD associate arrhythmia , dyslipidemia type 2 diabetes . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) acknowledge reliable marker cardiac autonomic control , frequency premature ventricular complex indicator arrhythmogeneity . The investigator find HRV significantly decrease 24-h sleep deprivation . Metoprolol could improve HRV reduce frequency premature atrial ventricular complex . But sleepiness hypotension occur frequently subject treat metoprolol . Statins significant cardiovascular protective effect patient cardiovascular disease . Statin could regulate serum lipid level , also antioxidant anti-inflammatory property . This study aim investigate ( 1 ) change heart rate variability occurrence cardiac arrhythmia continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram ( ECG ) young , healthy subject undergo 48h SD ( 2 ) effect statin HRV arrhythmia agent administer prophylactically SD .</detailed_description>
