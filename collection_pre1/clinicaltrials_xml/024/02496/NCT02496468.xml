	<detailed_description>About 25-30 % child least one episode wheeze 3rd birthday , considerable clinical heterogeneity exists . Many child become symptom-free 3 8 year age , go persistent asthma later childhood adulthood . Despite high prevalence , still little known pathomechanisms determine different wheeze trajectory phenotypes child , begin adulthood . Frequency severity exacerbation may play important role chronification process underlie mechanism equally well understood . Therefore , decipher role airway mechanic , genetic , environmental molecular determinant different childhood adult asthma phenotype exacerbation chronification process urgently need develop personalized treatment approach target distinct underlying mechanism . Thereby , secondary prevention early disease process also achieve . In order , clinical cohort childhood asthma set identical , standardized instrument ( quality assurance plan : standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) clinical lab module , shipment , biobanking analysis well quality control measure via audit site visit develop ) across participate 'German Center Lung Research ' ( DZL ) sit . Here , new-onset steroid/leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) naïve wheeze/asthma patient wheeze/asthma patient controller therapy recruit addition healthy control . Following recruitment , yearly follow-ups exacerbation visit include patient perform identical study instrument meticulous quality control check baseline . PROJECT HYPOTHESES : 1 . Specific molecular phenotype associate distinct wheeze/asthma phenotype trajectory . Thereby , underlie mechanism well predictor biomarkers persistent asthma identify . 2 . Individuals risk exacerbation identify clinical molecular biomarkers , become novel target therapy secondary prevention . WORK PROGRAM : 1 . Identification molecular phenotype , predictor biomarkers distinct wheeze/asthma phenotype trajectory . The investigator aim recruit total 360 case 150 control ensure sufficient statistical power multivariate statistical analysis . Recruitment study participant continue case undergo 'deep phenotyping ' describe . In addition , healthy age sex match control recruit outpatient clinic . Cases control undergo comprehensive clinical assessment include questionnaire ( browser-based online data entry extensive database audit trail , plausibility quality control check implement , data dictionary accessible ) , physical examination lung function test ( spirometry bodyplethysmography include bronchodilator response , multiple breath washout , exhale nitric oxide ) . Biomaterials collect follow analysis : ) blood sample ; ii ) nasal secretion ; iii ) pharyngeal swab ; iv ) induce sputum ; v ) stool sample . Furthermore , epithelial cell collect nasal brushing . Breath sample collect analysis volatile organic compound . The case follow yearly use clinical tool collect biomaterials initial visit ass trajectory time . Two closely interact work group establish aim describe herein : one lab one data management/analysis group , head expert member participate site . The lab group initiate supervise measurement biomaterials ; data management/analysis group expand combine share data base coordinate statistical analysis across site . A common publication policy already develop . Using advanced bioinformatics , system biology machine learning approach , investigator develop predictive ( diagnostic ) algorithms include clinical molecular biomarkers transient persistent wheeze/asthma phenotype heir trajectory . These analysis also identify underlie mechanism thereby potential target future personalize therapy compare childhood adult finding . During data collection . The investigator attempt minimize miss data . In case miss data reduce power subsequent analysis , imputation use order omit power loss . 2 . Identification risk factor mechanisms underlying exacerbation . Exacerbations assess case number , trigger , severity clinical feature via questionnaire visit . In addition , study participant present acute exacerbation define acute worsen symptom post exacerbation clinical evaluation sample follow biomaterials analysis : ( ) blood ; ii ) nasal secretion ; iii ) pharyngeal swab . Furthermore , primary epithelial cell collect nasal brushing . To facilitate recruitment , new asthma case may also enrol exacerbation . This allow time course analyse biomarkers differ trigger wheeze /asthma phenotype .</detailed_description>
