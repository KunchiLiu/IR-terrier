	<brief_summary>DS-5565 ( mirogabalin ) study treatment fibromyalgia pain . Because metabolized kidney , people reduce kidney function process drug well normal kidney function , dose must reduce . This study test two reduce dose level moderately reduce severely reduce kidney function . The study test hypothesis drug safe well-tolerated people fibromyalgia chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study DS-5565 Treatment Fibromyalgia Pain Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This stratify , randomize , double-blind , placebocontrolled , multi-center safety study DS-5565 subject Fibromyalgia ( FM ) renal dysfunction . Eligible subject randomize 2:1 receive either DS-5565 7.5 mg daily ( QD ) placebo category subject creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) 15-29 mL/min , 2:1 receive treatment DS-5565 7.5 mg twice daily ( BID ) placebo category subject CrCl 30-59 mL/min . Subjects stratify renal impairment CrCl . The treatment period 13 week duration . The total study duration ( individual subject ) approximately 21 week . The study include screening period ( approximately 3 week longer 35 day , include washout period [ necessary ] 1-week baseline period ) , double-blind treatment period ( 13 week ) , 4 week follow-up period .</detailed_description>
