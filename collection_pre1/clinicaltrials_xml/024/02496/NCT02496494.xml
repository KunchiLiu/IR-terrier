	<brief_title>The Effects Conversion From Cyclosporine Tacrolimus Changes Cardiovascular Risk Profiles Serum Metabolites Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During past two decade , cyclosporine prove valuable immunosuppressive drug contribute significant reduction incidence acute rejection kidney transplantation . However , cyclosporine know major factor cause cardiovascular death kidney transplant recipient . Moreover , cyclosporine adverse effect lipid profile fibrinolytic system result hypertension cardiovascular disease . Immunosupressive mechanism tacrolimus identical cyclosporine 100 time potent T cell inhibitor cyclosporine . In multicenter study Europe United state , tacrolimus show low incidence acute rejection know effective acute rejection resistant therapy . Tacrolimus lot advantage compare cyclosporine term hypertensive hyperlipidemic effect although evidence lack . One study demonstrate cardiovascular risk profile renal function improve kidney transplant patient randomize conversion cyclosporine tacrolimus Previous study analyze metabolite tacrolimus cyclosporine reveal difference observe metabolite level hypoxanthine , lactate , succinate , taurine two immunosupressants . The objective study evaluate change cardiovascular risk profile metabolite pattern conversion cyclosporine tacrolimus kidney transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
