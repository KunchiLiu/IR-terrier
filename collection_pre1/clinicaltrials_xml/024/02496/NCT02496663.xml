	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose necitumumab give together epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor AZD9291 ( osimertinib ) treat patient EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer stage IV come back ( recurrent ) progress previous EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Monoclonal antibody , necitumumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving necitumumab EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may better treatment EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGFR Inhibitor AZD9291 Necitumumab Treating Patients With EGFR-Positive Stage IV Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed Previous EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability AZD9291 ( EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 ) combination necitumumab patient EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) resistance previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity NSCLC patient EGFR-activating mutation progressive disease previous EGFR-TKI focus EGFR T790M negative expansion cohort . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics AZD9291 combination necitumumab . II . To explore biomarkers response resistance previous EGFR-TKIs combination study biopsied tumor tissue baseline progression , well serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) specimens . III . To create patient derive xenograft ( PDX ) model patient EGFR-mutant NSCLC prior study initiation acquire resistance treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study necitumumab . Patients receive EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 necitumumab intravenously ( IV ) 50 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 12 week 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
