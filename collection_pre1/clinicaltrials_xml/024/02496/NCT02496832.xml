	<brief_summary>Researchers look good way diagnose treat pancreatic cancer . It believe look low level oxygen ( hypoxia ) tumour may give good understand certain tumour grow respond certain treatment . This study look hypoxia pancreatic tumour participant receive treatment combination gemcitabine TH-302/placebo EMR 200592-001 clinical research study . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan look hypoxia tumour . PET image test use measure hypoxia tumour . For study , radioactive tracer call Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside ( FAZA ) use `` label '' area hypoxia tumour . Determining level hypoxia tumour tissue use FAZA-PET scan compare level patient 's response treatment gemcitabine TH-302/placebo pancreatic cancer may help researcher determine relationship hypoxia response treatment . The main purpose study see useful look hypoxia tumour do different centre .</brief_summary>
