	<brief_summary>Each year France , 7 % newborn bear preterm ( 37 week gestational age ( GA ) ) . The investigator call preterm infant bear 33 week GA . These preterm infant higher risk develop neurological complication like developmental disability cerebral palsy . To date , early assessment infant difficult reliable enough detect risk develop neurological issue . Now , investigator need identify early infant provide intervention improve development ( physical therapy example ) . Consequently , investigator examine study whose aim assess preterm infant habituation . Habituation newborn ability become familiar new environmental stimulation ( noise , light… ) . This habituation allow newborn maintain sleep even onset noise light . To study phenomenon infant bear preterm near correct term ( around 40 week postnatal GA ) , allow u good understand neurological development infant . The investigator plan compare habituation skill preterm infant near theorical date birth ( 40 week GA ) population infant born term . The investigator also study link habituation ability sleep quality well neurodevelopmental outcome correct age two year old .</brief_summary>
