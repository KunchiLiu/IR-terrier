	<brief_title>Renal Nerves Stimulation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately 10-15 % adult hypertension consider treatment resistant hypertension uncontrolled despite take three drug include diuretic . Renal denervation ( RDN ) novel treatment option therapy resistant hypertension rationale originate denervating renal sympathetic efferent afferent couple central autonomic nervous system . By denervating renal artery , general sympathetic tone reduce . Currently , RDN perform place spiral pattern 5-6 ablation lesion renal artery . 15-30 % patient benefit procedure . The reason unknown . Experimental data show renal nerve stimulation ( RNS ) may serve functional endpoint ass completeness RDN procedure . A RNS-guided RDN may prove superior standard RDN ( RNS-checked ) blood pressure control . Main objective twofold : 1 . To investigate feasibility RNS patient therapy resistant hypertension , assess functional distribution renal nerve use 3D imaging differential pacing modality . 2 . To investigate blood pressure responses cardiac excitable property RNS , subsequently perform RDN procedure , guide 3D map two different technique e.g . RNS-checked RDN RNS-guided RDN procedure . Secondary objective : The secondary objective compare technique ( RNS-checked vs. RNS-guided ) term efficacy safety . Hypotheses : - We hypothesize identification localization sympathetic nerve bundle use 3D navigation system selective pacing manoeuvre allow functional approach denervate kidney improve success rate procedure patient hypertension . - We hypothesize RNS-guided RDN procedure show well blood pressure data follow , since completeness assess contrast RNS-checked RDN procedure . Study design : Investigator initiate , single centre , prospective , feasibility study Study population : 40 patient ( 18 - 80 yr old ) - 20 patient treat RNS-checked RDN - 20 patient treat RNS-guided RDN Intervention : Two different technique use trial : 1 . RNS-checked RDN 2 . RNS-guided RDN Main study endpoint : Main study parameter arterial blood pressure response RNS prior RDN absence blood pressure rise response pace renal artery RDN . Secondary study endpoint : Blood pressure 3 , 6 , 12 month intervention , change blood pressure compare measurement intervention .</detailed_description>
