	<brief_summary>Surgery primary treatment modality many type cancer extent surgical resection directly related patient survival . However , often difficult surgeon distinguish normal neoplastic tissue detect metastatic disease tumor-infiltrated lymph node . In site , surgical precision also require avoid damage critical normal tissue . The purpose exploratory study evaluate intra-operative ex vivo fluorescence BLZ-100 tumor sample subject breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Safety ex Vivo Fluorescence BLZ-100 Adult Subjects With Solid Tumors Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects diagnose breast cancer surgical resection clinically indicate enrolled study . Upon obtain sign informed consent , subject enter Screening Period 14 day determine eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion eligible participate study . All subject enter study require arrive hospital ( Phase 1 unit applicable ) BLZ-100 administration least 2 hour schedule surgical procedure . Following administration BLZ-100 , subject continuously monitor safety allergic reaction occurrence 30 minute ; thereafter , subject evaluate 7 day drug administration . All subject follow least 30 day follow drug administration monitor SAEs . Tumor sample image situ ex vivo SIRIS image system equivalent device , process , sent central laboratory evaluate ex vivo fluorescence use Odyssey® CLx image system .</detailed_description>
