	<brief_summary>A grow body literature indicate 80 % amputee may phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . The first cause limb loss vascular disease . Usually , amputee suffer PLP suboptimal treat . Therefore , many amputee disable chronic pain . The etiology pathophysiology PLP poorly understood . Some study suggest somatosensory cortex reorganization . Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) analgesic technique . TENS apply low voltage electrical current skin use surface electrode order stimulate afferent nerve fibber . Because lack evidence support treatment PLP , interest turn prevent instead . The aim study assess early use TENS immediately postoperative major limb amputation due peripheral vascular disease , decrease PLP incidence . TENS interfere mechanism PLP production level pain fiber conduction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Postamputation pain highly prevalent vascular limb amputation . The physiopathological basis divide supraspinal , spinal peripheral mechanism . Supraspinal mechanism involve somatosensory cortical reorganization ; spinal reorganization dorsal horn , occur deafferentation peripheral nerve injury peripherical nerve injury begin nerve section surgery . All factor seem end somatosensory cortex reorganization . In sense , seem ability prevent PLP depend capability modulate plasticity Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation it´s safe , easy inexpensive analgesic technique act conduction pathway pain . An adequated program mandatory : balanced symmetrical biphasic pulse , pulse length great 250microsg , modulate high frequency electrode place dermatome correspond lumbar-sacral spine ; use intervention patient Hypothesis : In patient TENS use immediately postoperative major limb amputation due peripheral vascular disease , phantom limb pain appear less frequency control patient . Study population : Patients undergo major limb amputation peripheral vascular disease . Study design : A randomized , prospective , blind ( patient , physician , statistician ) , clinical trial placebo versus intervention group study design . In intervention arm , TENS apply 24 hour immediately limb amputation . The placebo arm , also carry TENS without active program . All patient receive standard analgesic treatment limb amputation hospitalization time . Evaluation objective : Before surgery patient make two test pain evaluation : The Analogical Visual Scale DN4 questionnaire neuropathic pain . At 3 day , 1 month 3 month surgery , patient evaluate pain use recommended test neuropathic pain : The Analogical Visual Scale DN4 ( neuropathic pain 4 ) questionnaire neuropathic pain . Also , month 1 3th , two test do order evaluate quality life : The SF-12 ( short form-12 ) health survey questionnaire health Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS ) sleep test .</detailed_description>
