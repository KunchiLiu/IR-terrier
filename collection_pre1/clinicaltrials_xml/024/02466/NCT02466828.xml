	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) common primary malignant brain neoplasm adult . Despite recent diagnostic therapeutic advance , include aggressive surgical resection chemoradiation , prognosis GBM improve slightly past two decade , median survival approximately 15 month . Tumor hypoxia feature GBM contribute poor outcome multiple mechanism 1 ) overexpression enzyme play role temozolomide resistance , main chemotherapeutic agent GBM 2 ) increase expression cancer stem cell resistant radiation . Hypoxic tumour region associate high rate progression recurrence . In study investigator use advanced MRI technique call qBOLD non-invasively measure oxygenation GBM obtain targeted biopsy . The investigator take advantage physical characteristic Ferumoxytol ( Feraheme® ) iron supplement , utilize two recent technical advance previously use human tumour quantitatively measure oxygenation GBM . Prior knowledge hypoxia assist prognostication individualization treatment plan special focus hypoxic region target radiation dose regimen modulation ; consideration intensive chemotherapy regimen ; aggressive target surgical resection closer short-term clinical image follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>qBOLD MRI Glioblastoma Multiforme Assessment Tumor Hypoxia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose study demonstrate quantitative oxygen saturation estimation GBM feasible qBOLD correlate establish histopathological marker hypoxia angiogenesis , target intraoperative oxygen measurement . All patient undergo surgery part standard treatment . By coregistering hypoxia map presurgical MRI able following : 1 . Obtain targeted biopsy hypoxic area none hypoxic area correlate gold standard marker tissue hypoxia immunohistochemistry hypoxia induce factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) . 2 . Draw Volumes interest ( VOI ) area &gt; 0.5-cm3 ( amenable accurate intra-operative O2 measurement ) low high oxygen saturation ( SO2 ) value . VOIs import neuronavigation system ( Stryker ) target placement clinically approve Licox® oxygen-sensing probe ( Integra NeuroSciences ) .</detailed_description>
