	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study radiation therapy cisplatin triapine see well work compare standard radiation therapy cisplatin alone treat patient newly diagnose stage IB2 , II , IIIB-IVA cervical cancer stage II-IVA vaginal cancer . Radiation therapy use high energy proton kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Triapine may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether radiation therapy cisplatin effective triapine treat cervical vaginal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With Without Triapine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IB2 , II , IIIB-IVA Cervical Cancer Stage II-IVA Vaginal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy experimental regimen triapine ( 3AP ) , cisplatin , radiation increase progression-free survival relative standard/control regimen cisplatin radiation woman uterine cervix cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine post-therapy 3-month fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) metabolic complete rate response European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) guideline woman uterine cervix cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine acute ( &lt; 30-day ) treatment-related toxicity assess Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 4 . II . To determine chronic late ( &gt; = 30-day ) treatment-related toxicity assess CTCAE , version 4 . III . To determine overall survival triapine-cisplatin radio-chemotherapy cisplatin radio-chemotherapy . IV . To determine peripheral blood methemoglobin proportion triapine infusion ( optional Arm 2 patient ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 , 30 ( day 36 37 treat physician 's discretion ) . Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) ( either conventional radiation therapy [ RT ] intensity modulate radiation therapy [ IMRT ] ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 25 fraction follow low dose rate ( LDR ) high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy accord institution 's standard . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cisplatin undergo EBRT follow brachytherapy Arm I . Patients also receive triapine IV 90 minute day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 33 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . The patient data NCI # 9434 merge NRG-GY006 per Protocol Analysis Plan .</detailed_description>
