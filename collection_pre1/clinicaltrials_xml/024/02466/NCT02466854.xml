BleeMACS registry enroll total 15,000 patient , include data 16 hospital 11 country : North America ( Canada ) , South America ( Brazil ) Europe ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland , Spain , Italy , Macedonia , Greece ) , Asia ( Japan China ) . The end-point study characterize patient high risk bleed develop risk score accurately predict risk major bleed within first year discharge hospital ACS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In December 2014 , give actual need rigorous multicenter clinical investigation test safety antithrombotic contemporary therapy patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , Dr. Sergio Raposeiras-Roubín Dr. Emad Abu-Assi launch BleeMACS ( Bleeding complication Multicenter registry patient discharge diagnosis Acute Coronary Syndrome ) project . Antithrombotic medication commonly use secondary prevention patient follow ACS . This therapy , along invasive strategy , prove effective , although increase risk bleeding , may counteract benefit . A grow body evidence demonstrate risk death patient ACS affect recurrent ischemic event also major bleed . Bleeding complication downside antithrombotic therapy , consistently associate short- long-term mortality , addition increase risk new thrombotic event particularly due temporary permanent modification/suspension antithrombotic therapy , especially relevant first year ACS . At present , several risk score predict bleed short-term ( hospitalization stage 30 day ) . However , medium long-term ( i.e. , ≤ 1 year ) , available predict system help clinicians quantify bleed risk patient . How could physicians predict risk bleed hospital discharge ACS ? The purpose project focus help clinician estimate patient 's baseline risk major bleed within first year follow ACS . The investigator aim identify independent predictor major bleed 1-year order develop user-friendly bleeding risk score . The score system investigator intend design use data present registry would help clinicians decision-making process identify optimal antithrombotic strategy , focus close attention patient high risk bleeding .</detailed_description>
