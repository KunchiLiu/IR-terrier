	<detailed_description>Most , , patient bipolar disorder ( BPD ) clinically significant cognitive impairment . Impairment present manic depress phase BPD , well euthymic period . The percentage BPD patient cognitive impairment ( CIBD ) vary among study , 40-60 % represent best estimate . The weight evidence support overall difference type severity cognitive impairment phase BPD , i.e . stable trait feature BPD , albeit variable one patient another . The commonly affected cognitive domain speed processing , declarative memory , attention work memory . Although CIBD milder severity cognitive impairment associate schizophrenia ( CIAS ) , average , schizophrenia , CIBD major impact function quality life patient , particularly great preservation function BPD enable engage activity dependent intact cognitive function . Thus , highly likely improvement CIBD valuable clinical benefit , especially regard quality life measure . It reasonable predict treatment effective improve CIBD could also beneficial CIAS . Efficacy cognitive impairment likely great BPD schizophrenia , baseline severity milder former . Despite strong rationale target CIBD , minimal focus clinical trial improve CIBD , perhaps many resource devote effort treat CIAS , lack appreciation severity CIBD importance determinant functional outcome BPD may important factor . In recent study CIBD , use MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) , impairment find treatment resistant BP I II depress inpatient within MCCB domain . The great impairment evident speed processing , declarative memory attention . The impairment numerically great BP I BP II patient difference significant . Compared normal control , deficit , BP 1 patient , speed processing 1.2SD , attention , 1.0 SD , verbal learning , 1.8 SD . The least affected domain visual learning , mean deficit 0.8SD compare normal control . The mean composite score deficit 1.25 SD . Medication BPD , particularly mood stabilizer , may adversely affect domain cognition BPD . However , antidepressant medication find affect severity cognitive impairment major depression BPD . Based pre-clinical , pro-cognitive effect 5-HT7 antagonism laboratory , along report pre-clinical antidepressant effect JNJ-18038683 , propose conduct randomize , placebo- control parallel , design study assess effect JNJ-18038683 multiple domain cognition mood symptom . Since preclinical study show 5-HT7 receptor blockade highly effective improve declarative memory rodent , declarative memory measure primary outcome measure . Due effect JNJ-18038683 depressive symptom preclinical paradigm , investigate follow clinical trial potential antidepressant effect JNJ-18038683 patient baseline MADRS score 8 20 .</detailed_description>
