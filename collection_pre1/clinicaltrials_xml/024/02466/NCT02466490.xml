	<brief_summary>Fimasartan ( FMS ) AT1 receptor antagonist indicate day administration , currently approve treatment essential hypertension Corea Mexico . As safety efficacy FMS initially demonstrate Korea , necessary address potential ethnic factor effect drug´s efficacy safety Mexican population . To address need , cohort 272 Mexican subject grade 1-2 essential hypertension sequentially treat treat target basis ( target : sit Diastolic Blood Pressure ( sDBP ) &lt; 90 mmHg ) 60 mg FMS day ( 8 week ) , either 120 mg FMS 60 mg FMS+12.5 mg HCTZ day ( randomize 4 week treatment period ) 120 mg FMS day ( 12 week ) total treatment period 24 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Fimasartan Alone Combined With HCTZ Mexican Patients With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open , multicentre , 24 week study subject grade 1-2 essential hypertension eligible , accord participate investigator 's clinical judgement , initial monotherapy . Consenting , eligible subject 13 Mexican participate center initially assign monotherapy 60 mg FMS day . At treatment week 8 , subject sDBP ≥90 mmHg randomize either 120 mg FMS 60 mg FMS + 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) day 4 week . At treatment week 12 , non-responding subject finally assign 120 mg FMS + 12.5 mg HCTZ remain 12 week plan 24 week treatment period . At treatment week 8 12 , subject sDBP &lt; 90 mmHg remain assigned treatment rest study . This cohort study design collect information treatment effect ( blood pressure change baseline/reference time treatment response rate ) , safety ( i.e. , incidence characterization clinical , laboratory ECG adverse event ) ; accordingly , subject assess treatment week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 term vital sign , clinical laboratory safety parameter , concomitant medication adverse event . 12-lead ECG recording obtain subject screen treatment week 24 subset 11 subject underwent baseline treatment week 8 24-hour ABPM recording .</detailed_description>
