	<brief_summary>Intravenous ( IV ) tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) administration show safe effective treatment AIS within 3 hour symptom onset , new evidence show potential benefit 4.5 hour . Mechanical thrombectomy AIS patient show clinical trial safe 8 hour symptom onset . Recent trial utilize advanced imaging identify patient large vessel occlusion amenable intra-arterial thrombectomy ( IAT ) show superiority endovascular therapy medical therapy result improve patient functional outcome . Pilot data utilize ADAPT approach show superior technical result similar functional outcome lower procedure time device cost versus traditional stent retriever first line therapy approach</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMPASS Trial : Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomized trial compare mechanical thrombectomy ADAPT approach stent retriever patient present AIS within 6 hour symptom onset . Any cleared mechanical stent retriever ( SR ) aspiration catheter device common use operator 's region practice approve use . Prior release site enroll patient , collect follow information recent 20 acute ischemic stroke case , least five must use direct aspiration first approach , least five must use stent retriever first approach . It permissible go back time farther recent 20 case fulfill either requirement . There requirement remain 10 case . The datapoints collect include : - Age - Gender - LVO location - Side LVO - NIHSS presentation - Time onset - Time hospital arrival - Time image complete - Time groin puncture - Time revascularization , applicable - Time procedure terminate , revascularization obtain - tPA give pre-procedure - Time IV-tPA - Imaging type - Perfusion image - Devices use - Passes attempt - Device success - Standard modify final TICI score - Outcome measurement : incidence post-op ICH , discharge 90 day NIHSS , discharge 90 day mRS , complication Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion , consent participate , randomize consider enrolled . Treatment arm randomly assign central web-based system 1:1 manner treatment either ADAPT SR thrombectomy . Data patient collect time enrollment treatment , subsequent follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
