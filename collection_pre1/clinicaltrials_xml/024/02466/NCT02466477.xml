	<brief_summary>Evidence exist support ability genetic variation influence patient drug response side effect . Previous study utilize open-label design show significant improvement major depressive disorder ( MDD ) patient outcomes follow use GeneSight Psychotropic ( GEN ) test . The first objective trial utilize double-blinded , randomized clinical trial design replicate previous finding improvement clinical outcome MDD subject whose medication therapy guide GEN test . Another objective determine add benefit Enhanced-GeneSight ( E-GEN ) compare GEN pharmacogenomic guidance treatment selection . Furthermore , trial intend develop evidence-based case value GEN E-GEN Canadian healthcare payer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study 1 ) compare efficacy GEN treatment usual ( TAU ) improve response psychotropic treatment outpatient suffer MDD - within current episode - inadequate response least one psychotropic medication include GEN ; 2 ) validate utility new CAMH marker demonstrate superior predictive capability great clinical utility E-GEN compare GEN . This study design three-arm multi-centre , double-blind ( participant raters ) , randomize control trial compare clinical economic outcome GEN , E-GEN TAU patient suffer MDD - within current episode - inadequate response least one psychotropic medication include GEN . Participants randomize 1:1:1 ratio three treatment arm . Recruitment 24 month . Follow-up 12 month . Subjects complete short diagnostic interview specific clinical diagnosis , basic metabolic measure ( eg . blood pressure , weight ) , provide buccal swab sample genetic analysis ( unanalyzed buccal swab associate DNA biobanked ) . During first visit , blood urine sample require laboratory panel screen blood biobanking . Subjects monitor one year period clinical measure healthcare resource utilization obtain . Treating clinician GEN E-GEN arm receive easy implement report provide pharmacogenomic guidance prescribe psychotropic medication patient . The study recruit subject 10 site , stratify 2 cluster . Nine study sit altogether form one two stratified cluster . CAMH constitute tenth study site second stratify cluster.The sample size require study calculate use effect size estimate draw previous study conduct Hall-Flavin et al [ Pharmacogenetics Genomics 2013 ; 23 ( 10 ) ] . Assuming effect size 0.30 HAM-D17 score favor treatment group , intra class coefficient cluster 20 % , statistical power 90 % , alpha level 0.05 , expect 16.7 % rate premature discontinuation Week 8 ( primary endpoint ) , total 570 subject ( i.e. , 190 per treatment arm ) require detect effect study .</detailed_description>
