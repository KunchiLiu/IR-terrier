	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common chronic inflammatory neurological disorder young adult . Due heterogeneous symptom , MS patient often inactive healthy control , result inactivity relate physiological profile . In healthy people , physical inactivity contribute development increase cardiometabolic risk state include combine presence cardiovascular risk factor ( increase cholesterol , elevate blood pressure , body fat , glucose intolerance/insulin resistance , inflammation reduce heart function/autonomic control ) . In population , secondary health complication , part , reduce physical exercise , often used primary treatment strategy . Since impact exercise cardiovascular risk factor MS unknown present project first aim explore , control research setting ( 12 week ) . A good understanding describe risk factor underlie physiological mechanism reduce incidence preventable comorbidities MS improve multidisciplinary treatment MS patient MS rehabilitation particular . Interestingly , investigator already report elevated prevalence impair glucose tolerance MS , clear whether cardiometabolic state MS also impair . Therefore , second part , researcher explore whether MS patient present high risk develop cardiovascular disease , measure assessment various cardiovascular risk factor , compare healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Sclerosis : Associated Cardiometabolic Risks Impact Exercise Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first part , various cardiovascular risk factor determine group MS patient ( n=~30 ) . Subsequently , patient enrol exercise intervention group ( 12 week high intensity interval training ) sedentary control group ( usual care ) . After 12 week , baseline cardiovascular risk measurement repeat determine impact high intensity interval training risk factor MS . In second part , cardiovascular risk factor large group MS patient ( n=~50 ) compare healthy control ( n=~25 ) , order determine whether MS patient show increased prevalence cardiovascular risk factor , thus elevate risk develop cardiovascular disease . In total , group 80 subject ( MS patient HC ) investigate throughout study , MS patient participate exercise intervention study . Measurements cardiovascular risk factor include : - body composition ( DEXA ) - blood pressure heart rate ( Omron M4-I ) - whole body glucose disposal ( oral glucose tolerance test ) - blood analysis : insulin , total cholesterol , high- density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein , plasma triglyceride , C-reactive protein glycosylated haemoglobin . Furthermore , maximal exercise test ( determination maximal heart rate , workload , lactate concentration , etc ) isometric/isokinetic strength test perform determine impact rehabilitation program MS patient .</detailed_description>
