	<brief_summary>Although doubt presence lymph node metastases worsens prognosis patient , unambiguous evidence support lymph node dissection still lack . For many solid tumor , role lymph node dissection yet controversial , may depend tumor type stage patient presentation diagnosis . Axillary surgery breast cancer consider staging procedure seem influence breast cancer mortality . Women breast cancer benefit greatly series carefully perform randomize control trial focus axillary surgery . The objective INSEMA show le axillary surgery well , oncological outcome less surgical intervention result few surgical complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , axillary surgery breast cancer consider staging procedure seem influence breast cancer mortality , since risk develop metastasis depend mainly biological behaviour primary ( seed-and-soil model ) . Based , postsurgical therapy consider basis biologic tumor characteristic rather nodal involvement . The goal present study show early-stage breast cancer patient reduce extent axillary surgery inferior regard disease-free survival outcome compare standard arm . All patient first randomize either axillary surgical intervention axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) . Patients SLNB pN+ ( sn ) status secondly randomize either SLNB alone completion axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) case less four involve node ( 1-3 macrometastases ) . Patients four metastatic sentinel lymph node undergo completion ALND . Postoperative systemic treatment base local multidisciplinary tumor board recommendation accord current German AGO S3 guideline . For woman treat breast-conserving surgery , common site local recurrence conserve ipsilateral breast . Thus , whole-breast radiation therapy breast-conserving surgery mandatory perform accord current guideline ( S3 , AGO , DEGRO ) . During follow-up , patient assess disease recurrence accord standard clinical practice . History physical examination perform every 6 month first 36 month yearly thereafter . Annual mammography sonography require ; test base symptom investigator preference . The total number patient randomized trial approximately 7,095 . An event-driven final efficacy analysis perform per-protocol two primary objective .</detailed_description>
