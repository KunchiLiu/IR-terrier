	<brief_summary>In 1985 , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve multichannel cochlear implant ( CIs ) adult profound hearing loss ; 1990 , implantation approve child . Since , procedure become standard care patient severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss . Successful outcomes dependent extrinsic factor , also intrinsic factor always modify CI team . Significant predictive factor hear outcome patient CIs previously report . These include , limited , duration deafness , level preimplant speech recognition , pre/postlingual status , couple device electrode . Recipient age appear significant impact hear outcome elderly candidate . Earlier study find , dimension proximity spiral ganglion cell , scala tympani ( ST ) prefer location CI electrode placement . A number recent study propose intraoperative factor may important determinant electrode location possibly audiological outcome . Preliminary report suggest intracochlear electrode position- specifically , placement within ST-is associate improved audiological outcome . Additionally , different surgical technique propose minimize trauma electrode insertion increase likelihood placement within ST - namely round window anteroinferior cochleostomy electrode insertion . Currently , best surgical approach electrode insertion highly debate , fuel lack strong evidence support one method another . While number CI center begin utilize round window approach , many large volume center United States world wide continue routinely employ cochleostomy electrode insertion . With increase number patient implanted great degree residual hearing , data become critical towards reduce intracochlear injury optimize patient outcome . To investigator ' knowledge , clinical study prospectively investigate relationship surgical insertion technique , intracochlear electrode location , postoperative hearing outcome . To end , investigator initiate multicenter prospective randomize control double-blinded study compare round window cochleostomy cochlear implant electrode insertion .</brief_summary>
