	<detailed_description>Study Aims The relationship endometrial cancer ( EC ) obesity well establish . However , study examine acceptability potential efficacy intervention promote weight reduction alter cancer-associated biomarkers endometrial cancer survivor . This investigation two specific aim . Aim 1 : To compare efficacy novel technology-based weight loss intervention : ) telephone encounter wireless scale , b ) smart phone personalize text messaging compare c ) enhance usual care group woman obesity history endometrial cancer . Hypothesis : Women telemedicine text intervention arm lose significantly weight woman enhance usual care arm . Aim 2 : 1a ) To explore patient ' understand relationship obesity endometrial cancer , 1b ) survey acceptability novel different approach weight loss . Hypothesis : The investigator anticipate study validate pilot data predecessor single-institution study demonstrate &gt; 25 % patient aware association excess body weight endometrial cancer . Investigators also assess acceptability various intervention design promote weight loss ( i.e . person counsel , phone-based , text messaging ) predict great interest intervention require few in-person visit clinic . Study Design Aim 1 : - 3 arm randomize controlled trial , weight loss intervention - Pre post intervention patient report psychosocial measure - Pre post intervention Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) explore impact weight loss body fat distribution - Pre post intervention analyse follow biomarkers : insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 ( IGFBP-1 ) ; adiponectin , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin 1-beta ( IL1-beta ) , interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) , interleukin 6 ( IL6 ) , interleukin 7 ( IL7 ) , interleukin 8 ( IL8 ) Aim 2 : Patient-reported survey ass knowledge correlation Body Mass Index ( BMI ) endometrial cancer incidence Study Population Aim 2 : Adult woman biopsy-proven endometrial cancer ( Types I II ) , BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 . Aim 1 : Aim 2 population plus Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) 0-1 , concurrent chemo radiation therapy , access wireless internet and/or smart phone device .</detailed_description>
