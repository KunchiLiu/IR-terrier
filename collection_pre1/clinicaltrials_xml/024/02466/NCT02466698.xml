	<brief_summary>Clostridium Difficile infection ( CDIs ) treat initially antibiotic therapy supportive care , surgical intervention reserve patient significant systemic toxicity perforation . Severe CDI may refractory medical management require surgical intervention , carry mortality approximately 40 % . Mortality associate CDI increase significantly severity infection increase . In patient fail medical management , early operation associate decreased mortality . However , lack validated tool predict necessity surgical intervention , combine significant morbidity associate total colectomy significantly reduce likelihood patient receive early surgical intervention . The purpose propose study assess addition intestinal PEG lavage via nasojejunal tube usual care treatment adult patient severe CDI immediate indication surgical intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite lack definitive evidence , total abdominal colectomy ( TAC ) currently recommend surgical intervention choice set severe-complicated CDI . This recommendation base meta-analysis study compare TAC partial colectomy surgery ( exploratory laparotomy without colectomy , ostomy formation ) surgery , find statistical mortality difference . This recommendation base result sensitivity analysis expert panel consensus consider potential confounding factor TAC occur later course disease sicker patient , anticipated patient value would pace value definitive procedure initial surgical intervention . Given high mortality fulminant CDI , early surgical intervention recommend . However , data regard optimal timing surgical intervention lack . Meta-analyses guideline strongly recommend early surgical management , define development shock requirement vasopressor , base low quality evidence , potential significant mortality reduction . On basis CDI toxin mediate inflammatory process colonic mucosa , Neal et al hypothesized surgical diversion fecal stream loop ileostomy intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage may effectively treat severe CDI . Widely refer 'Pittsburgh Protocol , ' regimen include colonic lavage 8 litre polyethylene glycol ( PEG 3350 ) intra-operatively formation loop ileostomy , follow antegrade Vancomycin flush ( 500mg 500cc Ringer 's Lactate TID ) IV Metronidazole ( 500mg TID ) 10 day . The study utilize before-and-after methodology compare experimental protocol historical control . Forty-two patient submit regimen 18 month . Three patient require reoperation TAC . 30-day mortality 19 % intervention cohort , compare 50 % control . 79 % survivor go ileostomy reversal within 6 month surgery . One potential benefit regimen give reduced morbidity compare TAC , practitioner may offer surgical intervention earlier management CDI exclusively therapy last resort . Despite limited sample size methodological shortcoming study , treatment regime adopt centre select case . A randomized control trial compare less invasive surgical approach total abdominal colectomy close prematurely give lack meaningful patient enrolment ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01441271 ) . Given positive result fecal diversion antegrade lavage vancomycin flush propose Neal et al , combine limited data regard benefit intracolonic vancomycin , novel treatment institute London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) accomplish lavage colon vancomycin flush antegrade fashion use nasojejunal feeding tube facilitate delivery select patient . The protocol allow lavage intracolonic antibiotic delivery similar provide 'Pittsburgh protocol ' without surgical fecal diversion . A small preliminary cohort patient complete protocol LHSC assess retrospectively , compare outcome group undergo Pittsburgh protocol initial total colectomy . The study approve Western University Research Ethics Board ( REB File # 104944 ) . Interim analysis past 24 month include 13 patient undergo study protocol , 9 undergoing Pittsburgh protocol 17 undergoing initial colectomy . Despite significant limitation study methodology , result encourage study warrant , especially give significant mortality associate fulminant CDI .</detailed_description>
