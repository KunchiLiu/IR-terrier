	<brief_summary>It well-known non-optimal stent implantation associate under-expansion incomplete strut apposition percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) lead high incidence restenosis stent thrombosis . OCT-guided PCI metallic stent previously show safe feasible , result well clinical outcome compare angiography-only guided PCI . Everolimus-eluting bioabsorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ; Abbott Vascular , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) make bioabsorbable polylactic acid backbone coat rapidly absorb polylactic acid layer contain control release antiproliferative drug , everolimus . BVS number propose advantage current metallic stent technology . These include elimination chronic source vessel irritation inflammation , reduce potential risk late scaffold thrombosis complete scaffold bioresorption . Although current generation Absorb BVS large strut thickness 150 μm compare 80 μm strut Xience stent , acute recoil polymeric device similar metallic stent . However , operator tent use dilate device less aggressively concern limitation elongation-at-break polylactide . Previous study report 20-30 % under-expansion malapposition BVS , would increase risk adverse event include late stent thrombosis . OCT-guidance may improve optimized scaffold placement also well outcomes . Therefore , investigator compare OCT guidance angiography-only guidance PCI BVS regard incomplete scaffold apposition neointimal scaffold coverage . Investigators also go compare two strategy regard clinical outcome verification cut-off value OCT-acquired uncover scaffold rate .</brief_summary>
