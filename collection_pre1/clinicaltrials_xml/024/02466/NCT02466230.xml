	<brief_summary>This study utilize rest state fMRI , arterial spin label imaging , diffusion tensor imaging , structural MR-imaging , MR-spectroscopy GABA Glutamate probe antidepressant mechanism repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . The image modality acquire open-label 5 week course rTMS depression currently depressed individual treatment resistant depression . Changes functional , structural , neurochemical marker investigate rTMS responder nonresponders elucidate mechanism plasticity correlate treatment response . Additionally , functional , structural , neurochemical signature baseline correlate subsequent treatment response investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) apply left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) alleviate mood major depression . This treatment receive FDA approval 2009 routine clinical use treatment major depression . A recently publish sham-controlled study show response rate 14 % real rTMS compare 5 % sham rTMS . The response , define great 50 % reduction Hamilton Depression Rating Scale pre-treatment post-treatment , also find 14 % one recent meta-analysis . The inclusion criterion study admit broad spectrum participant , range subject first major depressive episode , fail multiple medication trial , suggest subgroup robust response may mask unresponsive group . Abnormal function leave frontal lobe accompanies major depression may normalize rTMS Cerebral blood flow measure SPECT image reduce left DLPFC depressed subject increase course rTMS leave DLPFC . Decreased blood flow find broad region frontal paralimbic region depressed individual treatment success associate decreased blood flow inferior frontal lobes pre- post- treatment . Greater post-treatment vs. pre-treatment BOLD activation leave frontal region demonstrate use fMRI planning task engage frontal lobe . Left prefrontal myo-inositol reduce depressed subject normalize rTMS . The functional abnormality view frontal lobe isolation . However , recent work demonstrate network-based structural marker risk familial depression consist decreased cortical white mater volume . Resting state fMRI ( rs-fMRI ) test cross-regional temporal coherence low frequency oscillation brain response ( ~0.1 Hz ) believe represent spontaneous neural activity . Correlated spontaneous fluctuation understood reflect functional connection brain region arise history co-activation across one 's lifetime . Previous work show depressed patient exhibit alter functional connectivity pattern gauge rs-fMRI , study suggest difference may mitigate treatment antidepressant medication . However , whether TMS may affect functional connectivity unknown . I propose acquire several describe MRI type rTMS treatment search predictive marker rTMS treatment success well marker treatment-induced change . Arterial spin labeling acquire measure blood flow distribution throughout brain , confirm SPECT result already report test additional region change . Resting state fMRI collect DTI use explore structural basis functional network change . Structural MRI collect measure cortical thickness white matter volume may predictive rTMS response . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy collect confirm previously report finding rTMS-induced myo-inositol change , well consider Glutamate/Glutamine GABA spectrum , give importance neurotransmitter theory depression .</detailed_description>
