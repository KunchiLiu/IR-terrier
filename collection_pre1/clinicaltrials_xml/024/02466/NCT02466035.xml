	<brief_summary>Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) able exert long lasting effect child atopic disorder . Nutramigen LGG accelerate tolerance acquisition infant cow 's milk allergy . The mechanism effect still largely undefined . The effect LGG could relate least part immunoregulatory role play LGG . This probiotic balance generation cytokine possibly involve IgE- non-IgE-mediated cow 's milk allergy Interleulkin ( IL ) -4 , IL-5 , IL-10 , IFN-γ , TGF-β , TNF-Υ ) , contribute modulation inﬂammatory process . The investigator demonstrate child IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly high level IL-4 IL-13 response cow 's milk protein , tolerance associate marked reduction IL-13 production concomitant increase frequency IFN-γ releasing cell . Epigenetics study heritable ( potentially reversible ) change genome inherited one cell generation next alter gene expression involve change primary DNA sequence , highlight complexity inter-relationship genetics nutrition . There three distinct , closely interact , epigenetic mechanism ( histone acetylation , DNA methylation , non-coding microRNAs ) responsible modify expression critical gene associate physiologic pathologic process . The profile epigenetic modification associate Th lineage commitment , couple sensitivity early developmental period , lead speculation factor disrupt pathway may increase risk allergic disease . Specifically , effect DNA methylation endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitor act specific pathway ( Th1 T regulatory cell differentiation ) may favour Th2-associated allergic differentiation . MicroRNAs another structural component epigenetic mechanism post-transcriptional regulation messenger RNA translation . It recently identify specific Th2-associated microRNA ( miR-21 ) critical regulation Th cell polarization . It previously demonstrate inverse DNA methylation pattern cytokine involve Th2 response ( IL-4 , IL-5 ) compare cytokine involve Th1 response ( IL-10 , INF- ) child CMA acquire oral tolerance , pronounced effect treat Nutramigen LGG . The current study prospectively evaluate effect Nutramigen LGG commercially available hypoallergenic formula epigenetic mechanism may relate tolerance acquisition .</brief_summary>
