	<brief_summary>To increase potential timely detection treatment cardiac event , hospital implement number different cardio-respiratory monitoring method at-risk patient . The goal study compare different monitoring method determine efficient method monitor hospitalize patient - method lead quick response critical heart rhythm . The investigator test efficiency monitoring method implement new patient care unit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most patient hospital low risk develop abnormal heart rhythm vitals sign ( e.g. , heart rate , blood pressure ) measure intermittently , every 8 hour . In contrast , hospitalize patient risk cardiac arrest arrhythmia put telemetry continuously monitor heart rhythm . A telemetry monitor portable box attach patient 's ECG lead display heart rate rhythm central station . The monitor send alarm detects abnormal rhythm , notify person monitor patient check patient . Monitor watcher dedicate nurse technician monitor bank display . The watcher-to-patient ratio varies among hospital , single watcher monitor 16 72 patient one time . There also variation additional task assign watcher , communication modality watcher nurse ( e.g. , pager , overhead speaker , landline cell phone , bi-directional voice communication badge ) , alarm presentation nurse ( e.g. , via bedside monitor , centrally locate monitor , automate phone notification , none , rely telemetry watcher notification ) . A quick efficient response cardiac arrest critical order increase patient 's chance survival . There need good understanding impact monitoring efficiency factor workload monitor watcher , communication method , supportive technology include alarm automated notification system . The objective propose research identify test determinant efficient cardiac monitoring method . There 3 phase study : 1 . Characterize candidate monitoring method ( Phase 1 ) . The investigator study usual care monitor patient 6 hospital unit . As part usual care unit different monitoring method . These method vary term 1 ) location monitor watcher , 2 ) mean communicate routine life-threatening event ( e.g. , via pager ) , 3 ) monitor watcher ' patient load workload . For 6 unit , investigator collect data interview , observation , 20 cardiac arrest simulation . 2 . Determine monitor method lead consistently rapid response time lethal arrhythmia ( Phase 2 ) . Using interview , observation , simulation data collect Phase 1 , investigator develop computer simulation model 6 monitoring method allow identify efficient method . 3 . Test efficient monitoring method ( Phase 3 ) . In new patient care unit previously include study , investigator implement efficient monitoring method , determine simulation model . In unit , conduct 40 cardiac arrest simulation implementation 40 additional simulation implementation . The hypothesis response time critical arrhythmia shorter use new monitoring method .</detailed_description>
