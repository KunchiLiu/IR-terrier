	<brief_title>Study Regorafenib Sildenafil Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-arm , open-label , phase 1 trial determine RP2D combination regorafenib sildenafil . Both study medication take orally day 1-21 28-day cycle . Using modify 3+3 dose escalation design , 3-6 patient advance solid tumor enrol dose level . Additional patient enrol MTD total 12 patient treated MTD . Eligible patient receive available standard treatment . Patients solid tumor regorafenib would consider standard treatment eligible long regorafenib previously administer . Blood sample collect correlative study include PK , PD , CTCs . Tumor sample archive previous biopsy surgery also collect correlative study .</detailed_description>
