	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Techniques Cubital Tunnel Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study compare different technique cubital tunnel release . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine difference patient-directed outcome score different technique use cubital tunnel release . 2 . Determine difference post-operative pain score different technique use cubital tunnel release . 3 . Determine difference objective measurement range motion grip strength score different technique use cubital tunnel release . 4 . Determine difference complication different technique use cubital tunnel release . Background : Compression ulnar nerve elbow ( cubital tunnel syndrome ) second common compressive neuropathy upper extremity ( carpal tunnel common ) . Patients fail conservative treatment ( activity modification , splint , medication ) offer cubital tunnel release . There multiple technique decompress ulnar nerve elbow , ideal release determine . These technique vary simple decompression nerve ( in-situ release , endoscopic release ) , decompress nerve move anteriorly take tension nerve ( subcutaneous transposition , sub-fascial transposition , sub muscular transposition ) , remove part medial epicondyle ( medial epicondylectomy ) . Each procedure purport benefit also potential complication . Simple in-situ release benefit shorter operative time less surgical dissection , however , nerve may subluxate post-operatively cause persistent pain . Procedures move nerve ( subcutaneous transposition , sub-fascial transposition , sub muscular transposition ) prevent subluxation take tension nerve , however , require dissection , large incision , also partially devascularize nerve . Medial epicondylectomy prevents subluxation decompress nerve , patient may prolong recovery persistent pain remove part bone . Significance : The result study may provide high level evidence determine specific technique cubital tunnel decompression result improve patient outcome and/or few complication .</detailed_description>
