	<brief_summary>Background : Taking consideration ongoing inversion population pyramid limitation medical condition , predispose episode fall among elderly people , implementation exercise physical treatment capable promote postural balance group study make necessary . Objectives : Assess influence electronic platform Kinect Sensor® ( KS ) tool treatment postural balance elderly individual . Method : The study include 10 elderly ( 60 70 year old ) 10 young ( 20 30 year old ) individual . Treatment protocol compose five week session perform twice week application KS . Initial final evaluation include static dynamic balance instrument : Berg Balance scale Timed Go Romberg Tandem test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample Each volunteer agree participate research signing informed consent . The present work approve Ethics Committee Research School Medical Health Sciences Juiz de Fora , SUPREMA University , Juiz de Fora , Brazil , statement 0015/12 . Each subject fill adequately anamnesis questionnaire compose item refer inclusion exclusion criterion . Those consider incapable performing activity involve maintenance balance belong health risk group exclude . Health risk define criterion , cardiopathy , uncontrolled hypertension , auditory visual impairment , neurological disturbance severe muscle-skeletal condition . Besides factor , score inferior 45 point Berg Balance Scale also result exclusion . In order collect data , 26 individual Hospital Maternity Ward Therezinha de Jesus ( School Medical Health Sciences Juiz de Fora , SUPREMA University , Juiz de Fora , Brazil ) evaluate . Among , six exclude distinct reason , , abandon propose session present risk factor insert exclusion criterion study . The experimental group compose 10 subject ( eight female ) mean age 64.5 year old control group 10 participant ( five female ) mean age 23 year . The sampled individual subject sequence test specifically devise static dynamic balance , could use comparison parameter postural balance among individual . The test apply : ) Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) ; b ) Romberg Tandem test ; c ) Berg Balance scale . Protocol Treatment protocol consist 10 session maximal length 6 minute perform activity use KS . The interval evaluation five week session take place twice time week , accord participant availability . Before first session one day precede last , individual evaluate concern static dynamic balance . Arterial pressure ( AP ) measurement stretch activity perform prior KS session . Afterwards , AP measure . Berg Balance Scale Berg Balance scale main instrument assessment postural balance , also use exclusion criterion . It use clinical practice , mainly elderly population neurologic disturbed patient , refer rehabilitation . The test constitute 14 ordinary static dynamic balance task , relate quotidian life activity , get , transfer oneself , stand , reach object turning . Each task generate score zero four point , total may 56 point . Points subtract total task , subject need aid external support device accomplish particular task . According Berg et al. , patient score less equal 45 high risk fall ambulation , justify exclusion volunteer attribute inferior score aforementioned . Timed Up Go Test In order perform Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) , subject would rise chair , walk three meter return chair . The speed task execution establish participant , stimulation use verbal command . The time execution measure initial evaluation one day past tenth session . Romberg TandemTest According protocol establish Romberg Tandem test , participant remain eye close orthostatic position , calcaneus bone non-dominant foot place ahead toe dominant foot , loose balance reach 60 second , maximal time . Arterial Pressure Arterial pressure ( AP ) measure session . Individuals present hypertension stage 3 ( ≥ 180 systolic ≥ 110 diastolic ) , pose threat practice physical activity , withdrawn treatment . Stretching After AP measurement , subject instruct perform muscular stretching exercise . The activity perform active assisted fashion , bilaterally , lateral cervical flexion , anterior posterior inclination cervical column , orthostatic torso flexion , torso lateral inclination rotation transverse plane . With upper limb , motion propose flexion shoulder elbow , horizontal adduction shoulder flexion extension finger wrist . The participant also perform global exercise , cross walk , touch knee hand alternately . Kinect Sensor All individual , include one place control group , instructed execution activity accompany verbal command . They position front KS high level Stack em Up mode ( available title Yourshape : Fitness Evolved® ) , keep static position upper limb raise , simulate sustain platform . Colored box fall upon simulated platform must deposit lateral inclination torso towards leave right , accord visual stimulus television , virtual aperture open alternate side bottom screen . Eventually , fiery box fall , necessary raise inferior limb side box fall towards platform order extinguish fire , thus flex knee pelvic region 90º . Statistic Analysis D'agostino &amp; Pearson test apply verify normality data . The mean analysis do pair Student 's t-test parametric data Wilcoxon test non-parametric data group ; unpaired Student 's t-test perform parametric data Mann Whitney test non-parametric data evaluate group .</detailed_description>
