	<brief_title>Cardiac Performance Pregnant Obese Women : Are They Jeopardy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity define : abnormal , excessive fat accumulation present risk health . A crude population measure obesity body mass index ( BMI ) , person 's weight ( kilogram ) divide square height ( meter ) . A person BMI 30 generally consider obese . A person BMI equal 25 consider overweight . Obesity reach particularly alarming level Middle East North Africa ( MENA ) region . The prevalence female obesity currently estimate 40 % , already exceed Europe USA . Obesity link several major chronic disease , include type II diabetes , cardiovascular disease , select cancer , gallbladder disease , asthma , osteoarthritis , chronic back pain . Obesity also link wide spectrum cardiovascular change range hyper dynamic circulation , subclinical cardiac structural change , overt heart failure . Obesity associate hemodynamic overload due increase metabolic demand impose expand adipose tissue augment fat-free mass obesity result hyper dynamic circulation increase blood volume . In addition increase preload , leave ventricular ( LV ) load also elevate obese individual due increase peripheral resistance great conduit artery stiffness . Right ventricular load may increase , presumably due associate sleep disorder breathe LV change . Pregnancy associate hemodynamic hormonal change affect heart . From first trimester , increase cardiac output place volume load heart . Hormonal change include increased circulate estrogen relaxin , may directly indirectly affect heart . During pregnancy , heart undergoes remodel similar observe athlete , increase chamber dimension , leave ventricular ( LV ) wall thickness , mass , consistent process eccentric hypertrophy . Myocardial contractile function also change pregnancy . Ejection-phase index LV function , include systolic fractional shortening ( FS ) mean velocity circumferential fiber thickening ( V CFC ) , variously report increase , remain constant , decrease , pregnancy . Thus , obese woman likely encounter problem become pregnant . There large evidence literature demonstrate woman overweight great risk develop pregnancy complication problem associate labor delivery .</detailed_description>
