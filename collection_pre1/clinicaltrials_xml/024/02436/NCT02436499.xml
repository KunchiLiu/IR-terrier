	<brief_title>Chronic Migraine Treatment With Botulinum Toxin-A : Investigation Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Changes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A propose 12 patient recruited participation pilot study . Consenting patient age 18-65 year old confirm chronic migraine ( defined International Headache Society criterion ) meeting inclusion criterion ( describe full protocol ) enrol participation trial . Participants currently receive migraine prophylaxis taper specified medication ( taper regimen determine clinician ) 4-week washout period observe prior baseline assessment Botox treatment . These patient permit use acute migraine medication require . Participants undergo baseline migraine significance assessment , include Headache Impact Test ( HIT-6 ) , Migraine Disability Assessment ( MIDAS ) questionnaire Migraine Impact Questionnaire . Baseline neurological assessment also conduct visit . Additionally , baseline Beck Depression Anxiety Inventories complete . Participants also undergo baseline fMRI 3Tesla Siemens MRI magnet National Research Council ( NRC ) Building locate 435 Ellice Avenue Winnipeg , Manitoba . At time , structural rest state fMRI data acquire . A 72-hour minimum migraine-free period ensure individual allow proceed imaging . A localizer image obtain . This use determine participant 's head position set field view subsequent image . Next , high-resolution 3-dimensional image take whole brain . This acquire follow image parameter [ Siemens MP-RAGE sequence , 1mm thick slice , zero spacing slice , repetition time 1900 m , echo time 2.2 m , plane resolution 0.94 x 0.94 , 256 x 256 matrix size 24 cm field view , 176 volume , result 8 minute 6 second scan time ] . After high-resolution image acquire , rest state fMRI data acquire follow parameter [ Siemens echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence , 3 mm thick slice , zero spacing slice , repetition time 3000 m , echo time 30 m , flip angle 90Â° , 64 x 64 matrix size , 24 cm field view , 140 volume , result 7 minute 9 second scan time ] . This provide data set functional connectivity analysis . The high-resolution anatomical data serf background display superimpose rest state fMRI data . All image data acquire alpha-numeric code represent study protocol number participant number ; data transfer flash drive copy principal investigator 's hard drive analysis . All participant paperwork data back-up securely store principal investigator 's locked filing cabinet . Following baseline screening , participant receive two subsequent treatment botulinum-A toxin , separate 12 week . Participants receive standardize botulinum-A toxin dose chronic migraine prophylaxis , comprise 155 total unit give 31 specify site across 7 head/neck muscle ( protocol explicitly describe full protocol ) . Second dose botulinum-A toxin either maintain 155 total unit dose initially , increase 195 total unit , depend response clinical questionnaire examination evaluate response efficacy ( describe full protocol , consistent `` Follow-the-Pain Injection Paradigm '' ) . Following initial treatment ( Day=0 ) participant request maintain daily headache diary , ask record symptom active migraine well use acute migraine medication daily basis , order track migraine frequency severity ( example headache diary include full protocol ) . Participant timeline follow : Day 0 ( baseline assessment , fMRI first Botox injection ) , Day 28 ( clinic follow-up ) , Day 56 ( second fMRI ) , Day 84 ( clinic follow-up second injection ) , Day 112 ( clinic follow-up ) Day 140 ( third fMRI ) . Clinic follow-up schedule Days 28 , 84 112 time adverse event review , well headache frequency report daily headache diary . At time point , participant also repeat assessment complete baseline visit , include HIT-6 , MIDAS Migraine Impact Questionnaire . At study termination ( Day=140 ) patient undergo final fMRI scan per baseline MRI protocol previously describe .</detailed_description>
