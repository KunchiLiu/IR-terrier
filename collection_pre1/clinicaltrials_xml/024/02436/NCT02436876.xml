	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety clinical benefit MBN-101 administer intraoperatively infected osteosynthesis sit patient diagnosed fracture site infection associate orthopaedic hardware . Three quarter patient receive MBN-101 , one quarter receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Clinical Activity Local MBN-101 Treatment Infected Osteosynthesis Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative orthopaedic infection , particularly antibiotic-resistant infection , present serious clinical challenge surgeon treat physician . These infection involve implant foreign material ( stabilize orthopaedic hardware ) , make infection site much likely foreign material involve . MBN-101 broad spectrum antimicrobial activity orthopaedic wound pathogen . This randomized , single-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center study ass safety tolerability escalate dos MBN-101 treat infect osteosynthesis site revision surgery without hardware removal replacement patient diagnose apparent fracture site infection within one year last surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
