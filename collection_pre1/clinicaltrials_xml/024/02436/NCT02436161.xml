	<brief_title>Effectiveness Multidisciplinary Care Management Program High-risk Patients With Heart Failure ( PROMIC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION In light increase prevalence chronic diseases comorbidities result increase life expectancy population , need develop care model adequately respond healthcare sociodemographic need populatión actual context apply propose . Patients chronic and/or multiple disease present great health care need tend experience imbalance system great intensity . Investigators concentrate research patient admit HF due high prevalence complexity disease fact patient present multiple chronic condition . These patient normally elderly present high degree comorbidity poly-medication , poor treatment adherence difficulty selfcare . The majority patient admit HF level 3 Kaiser pyramid together patient complex health care need . There evidence high degree multidisciplinarity result well team coordinatión train effective care complex high-risk patient , HF patient good example . PROMIC organisational care management innovation provide comprehensive integrated approach patient high degree complexity , case , patient admit HF . It promote integratión care different healthcare setting change nurse role self-care training patient . As , PROMIC help ensure continuity patient care environment . The aim innovative care model PROMIC intend provide high-risk HF patient improve health outcome modify current care model chronic disease , thereby serve foundation future intervention targetting chronic patient multiple comorbidities complex health care need . Indeed , precisely due presence comorbidities type patient , investigator consider coordination consultant specialities essential . As HF patient present marked comorbidity , investigator expect experience acquire project help design intervention broaden cover complex chronic patient likely benefit care management program . OBJECTIVES - To evaluate effectiveness multidisciplinary care management collaborative program high-risk patient HF admit hospital , base 6 component Chronic Care Model `` PROMIC '' , term reduce Combined event rate ( readmission / cardiac event / death / emergency department visit ) variable , feasibility program , improvement quality life relate health functional capacity PROMIC patient compare control patient usual care . - To understand opinion professional involve process use discussion consensus method order design effective comprehensive clinical organisational intervention . The goal project establish sustainable care model patient admit HF improve health outcome . The understanding gain implementation model lead research involve care type complex chronic patient . METHODOLOGY DESIGN : A quasi-experimental , prospective one year follow-up study . SETTING AND SUBJECTS : Primary Health care Centres Interior County Bizkaia Araba County Araba , Galdakao Hospital , Santa Marina Hospital University hospital o Araba Basque Country . Will capture minimum intervention group 125 patient admit HF NYHA functional status II-III-IV previous mention hospital . Another 125 patient different primary health care center control group . INTERVENTION : The intervention apply PROMIC , control patient receive usual care . PROMIC organizational innovation comprise complex intervention contain component support scientific evidence content base clinical practice guideline , ( CPGs ) well regard implementation , base Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) , develop Ed Wagner McColl Institute ( Seattle , USA ) 1990s . As complex intervention , investigator select theoretical methodological framework design evaluation complex intervention clinical setting develop healthcare public health service work group United Kingdom Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , comprise four phase . In phase 0 investigator undertaken strategic need research evaluation process comprehensive literature search regard management HF patient complex chronic comorbid patient order identify select area optimization . Phase 1 comprised design intervention program collaboratión professional field primary care , hospital social care , well primary researcher manager , pilot intervention small number patient take account actual context Basque country public health system Primary care well developed effective high quality hospital care . The pilot intervention deploy 15 polymedicated ( mean 11 drug ) patient admit HF multiple comorbidities ( mean six chronic disease ) confirm feasibility . This pilot study conclude positive result lead implementation quasi-experimental phase 2 trial . Intervention ( PROMIC ) perform framework six component CCM . 1 . Healthcare organisation . Investigators hold 18 joint work session involve component multidisciplinary team establish content clinical care organisational intervention . 2 . Delivery system design . A care management model describe circuit communication healthcare non-healthcare professional define joint session . 3 . Use clinical information system . Investigators use electronic case history share professional involve patient care , act care record action reminder . 4 . Decision-making support . Investigators standardise information contain discharge plan report communication professional return home protocolized pharmacological treatment indicate guideline . The individual problem present patient manage comprehensive personalize intervention . Investigators design theoretical/practical training plan study participant 27 hour physicians 42 hour nurse , complement course electrocardiography , basic recommendation cardiology drug titration nursing staff . 5 . Education self-care empowerment patient family . Creation new nursing role aim coach educate patient family evaluate level understanding self-care . Investigators prepare educational support material personalize self-care aim patient carers . 6 . Integration community resource . Investigators establish meeting contact social worker community pharmacist . MEASUREMENTS : The mean outcome measure time free event time inclusion first event ( readmission / cardiac event / death / emergency visit ) . Secondary endpoint quality life relate health ( MLFHQ SF-12 ) , functional capacity ( 6-Minute Walk Test ) , structural change cardiac structure ( brain natriuretic peptide BNP ) , adherence drug treatment ( Morinsky- Green questionaire ) , cost program base adjusted clinical group ( ACG ) , usefulness acceptability PROMIC professional patient .
