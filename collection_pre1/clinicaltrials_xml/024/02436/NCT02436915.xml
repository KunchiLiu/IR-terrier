	<detailed_description>Biological aging , especially couple cardiovascular risk factor , lead chronic endothelial dysfunction within cerebral micro-vessels impair brain 's ability meet metabolic demand place upon everyday life . This chronic mismatch blood supply metabolic demand often lead cerebral microvascular disease ( CMD ) , accumulation ischemic damage within network frontal subcortical region . CMD recognize white matter hyperintensities MRI scan manifest clinically mobility impairment , executive dysfunction depress affect . As 11-17 % elderly individual present constellation symptom , symptom independently link increased morbidity mortality , CMD critical yet understudied healthcare issue rapidly-growing personal economic cost . There currently cure CMD trial aim pharmacological improvement nonselective systemic vasodilation report therapeutic value ( Sorrond &amp; Lipsitz , 2011 ) . Our team , however , demonstrate severity clinical symptom suffer CMD critically dependent upon brain 's remain capacity activate appropriate cortical network metabolic demand increase performance various cognitive-motor task ( Purkayastha et al. , 2014 ; Sorond et al. , 2010 ; Sorond et al. , 2011 ) . Therefore , investigator predict improvement capacity activate appropriate cortical network response increase metabolic demand would ameliorate symptom improve quality life patient CMD . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) enable noninvasive , selective sustain modulation cortical activation . tDCS work send low-level current two scalp electrode , alters brain polarity thus , perfusion cortical excitability . One 20-minute session tDCS target leave prefrontal cortex acutely increase cortical activation cognitive motor task performance healthy adult . Investigators demonstrate stimulation improves mobility cognitive performance community-dwelling older adult . Moreover , repeat tDCS session one month period reduce symptom depression may improve executive function healthy individual . This preliminary evidence suggest tDCS may effective intervention CMD ; however , impact tDCS disease investigate . The study investigator ultimately aim investigate therapeutic efficacy tDCS patient CMD conduct double-blind , proof-of-principle , sham-controlled trail along extensive functional neurophysiological assessment . In order finalize design plan implementation definitive trial , investigator currently aim : 1 . Conduct pilot study establish feasibility deployment tDCS large population individual CMD , obtain preliminary evidence causal effect intervention mobility , executive function depressive symptom population . 2 . Within pilot study , investigate effect tDCS intervention cortical activation response cognitive-motor task . This study provide first-of-its-kind , proof-of-principle evidence whether tDCS provide meaningful symptomatic relief patient CMD . Moreover , inform definitive , larger-scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) provide information recruitment retention , compliance , estimate effect size , neurophysiological underpinnings expect functional improvement . If successful , knowledge gain also expect spur investigation tDCS treatment many diseases—from dementia diabetes—that negatively impact brain 's capacity activate appropriate cortical network .</detailed_description>
