	<brief_title>The Predictive Ability 4MGS IPF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study investigate simple test usual walking speed , measure use 4 metre gait speed ( 4MGS ) test patient lung disease call Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . Drug development disease slow part lack reliable measurement assess effectiveness treatment . Death hospital admission currently consider meaningful endpoint research trial due lack fully validate surrogate endpoint IPF . Using surrogate endpoint could reduce sample size , cost duration clinical trial IPF perhaps permit rapid drug development . Slow walk speed show consistently associate survival risk factor disability , institutionalisation hospitalisation old adult people another lung disease call Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . We interested see whether usual walk speed change usual walk speed 6 month predict death hospital admission IPF patient . This help inform u potential use 4MGS surrogate endpoint . To , participant consent take part study time walk usual walk speed distance 4 metre ( 13.12 foot ) one time point six month later . Incidence mortality non-elective hospital admission assess 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>IPF diagnosis accord NICE guideline Significant comorbidities would limit walk ability , exercise capacity make exercise unsafe ( e.g . unstable ischaemic heart disease , neuromuscular disease , severe hip/lower limb joint pain , peripheral vascular disease , low limb amputation ) Any patient chief investigator feel unsafe exercise ( e.g . unstable cardiovascular disease ) Any condition precludes provide informed consent e.g . cognitive impairment poor English</criteria>
