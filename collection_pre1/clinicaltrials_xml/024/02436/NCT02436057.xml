The prescription initially create website base patient 's unique GI PROMIS `` fingerprint '' , modify provider base interaction patient . The clinician patient also access PROMIS-tailored education exam room jointly review pertinent material , include animation normal abnormal GI function , reinforce patient ' educational experience around PROMIS symptom . The aim current study validate use GI PROMIS clinical practice conduct pragmatic clinical trial ( PCT ) compare delivery GI PROMIS novel e -- platform vs. usual care .</brief_summary>
