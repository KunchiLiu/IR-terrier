	<brief_title>Bed Side Thoracentesis Among Non-Ventilated Patients With Respiratory Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence pleural effusion high among medical patient , reach 62 % among Medical ICU patient . Often clinicians stand front symptomatic respiratory patient moderate large pleural effusion . The clinical question whether TC beneficial patient respiratory compromise yet show . There , small scale study benefit pleural effusion thoracentesis . Only one study find sustained effect thoracentesis oxygenation among 10 patient mechanical ventilation . Lung function find improve TC among patient paradoxical movement hemidiaphragm , relief dyspnea large pleural effusion TC demonstrate well . No study date , investigator know , benefit TC , do non-ventilated , ward patient moderate large pleural effusion . Also , study date show improved clinical outcome procedure . Although ultrasound guide TC safer mode blind TC , complication pneumothorax , pain , shortness breath , cough , bleeding , hematoma , re-expansion pulmonary edema may result TC . Although consensus exist regard benefit TC still procedure common among ventilated non-ventilated patient . The investigator seek find whether clinical benefit TC , among non-ventilated , ward patient moderate large pleural effusion . For purpose investigator aim conduct prospective randomize trial . In study investigator aim compare outcome : hospital length stay , vital sign wellbeing , utilization image modality readmission rate among patient therapeutic TC compare . Also investigator would like try predict amount pleural effusion ultrasound image well find added value point care US screen pleural effusion top routine Xr among patient respiratory instability . To best investigator ' knowledge , prospective randomize study date compare strategy TC none among non-ventilated ward patient respiratory complains . This prospective , double-center , randomized clinical trial . This stage 1 pilot trial aim provide well understand study population study group . This trial comprise total 60 patient , 30 subject intervention group equal number control group . The result pilot trial design large trial calculate require sample size .</detailed_description>
