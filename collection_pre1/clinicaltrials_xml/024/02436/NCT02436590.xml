	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study exposure PEMF alters cytokine environment OA joint associate reduction inflammation improve homeostasis extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , potentially effect symptomatic relief OA pain , reduce cartilage breakdown , stimulate new cartilage formation therefore preserve joint structure . The primary objective study prospectively determine , 12 month post treatment , safety efficacy treat OA knee PEMF . Safety assess adverse event collection . Study subject randomize 2:1 ratio ( active : placebo control ) either active placebo control ( inactive ) Physio-Stim device . The study power detect significant difference group 120 subject ( 80 active : 40 placebo control ) complete study . Planned enrollment study 150 subject , allow attrition rate 20 % .</detailed_description>
