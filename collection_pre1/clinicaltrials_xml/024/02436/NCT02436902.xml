	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common malignancy , incidence expect increase many country come decade . Though prognosis patient HCC generally poor , hepatic resection effective curative treatment , indication expand recent year . Resection reasonably safe effective even patient micro- macrovascular invasion . However , recurrence rate HCC high 74 % patient intermediate advance HCC resection . Microvascular invasion one main risk factor influence risk HCC recurrence patient prognosis resection . Therefore , adjuvant therapy prevent tumor recurrence resection important improve patient prognosis . Nowadays , adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) report effective reduce early recurrence rate mortality patient HCC risk factor recurrence . Sorafenib novel drug effective advanced stage HCC . However , efficacy adjuvant sorafenib postoperative HCC unknown . Therefore , interest investigate efficacy adjuvant sorafenib , compare efficacy TACE , TACE plus sorafenib , best supportive care patient postoperative HCC microvascular invasion .</brief_summary>
