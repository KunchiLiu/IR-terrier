	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) Patients With Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The circulation blood around body dependent effective pump heart . Patients claudication experience pain discomfort legs usually activity walking , go away rest . Claudication symptom peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . If leave untreated , patient develop arterial insufficiency lead various complication swell , painful leg , reduce heal injury loss limb extreme condition . PAD define narrow artery reduce blood flow . It commonly due atherosclerosis , association heart disease , stroke , diabetes . Its incidence estimate 7-14 % general population , increase age 20 % over-seventies . It associate effect mobility , skin condition quality life . Symptoms include pain legs walking ( intermittent claudication ) , pain rest ( particularly night ) , gangrene , limb loss . Management PAD base encouraging exercise , modification risk factor smoke , high blood pressure , high cholesterol diabetes . In patient PAD , exercise tolerance often limited . Severe symptoms disease treat procedure balloon angioplasty , stenting surgical bypass , procedures risk . There also remain percentage patient suitable revascularisation , option besides amputation available . Some trial show increase blood flow legs time use medical device ( intermittent pneumatic compression , muscle stimulators ) , addition maximal medical surgical therapy , increase claudication distance , absolute walk distance , decrease rest pain , reduce amputation rate . In unit become apparent increase number medical device available circulatory support , either use inpatient , out-patient , member general public . The support evidence variable scientific clinical content relevance , require clinical trial evaluate . The device use study , activate pump action leg muscle provide neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) cause foot muscle contraction relaxation . This squeeze blood back towards heart , improve circulation . The study evaluate whether NMES use device beneficial effect patient intermittent claudication .</detailed_description>
