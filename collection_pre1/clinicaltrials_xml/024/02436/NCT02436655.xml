	<brief_title>Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Conservative Treatment Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) therapy obvious choice symptomatic severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) patient , improve symptom , LV function survival . Therefore , accurate diagnosis disease , determination severity precise evaluation patient ' clinical status essential . However , treatment decision indication AVR asymptomatic patient severe AS normal leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) vague subject ongoing debate . The recent European American guideline class I indication AVR asymptomatic severe AS patient normal LV EF patient already schedule cardiac surgery ( example by-pass surgery ) . In case symptom positive stress test American European guideline differs , European guideline class I indication American guideline IIb indication . In case asymptomatic severe AS patient normal LV EF level evidence C , word randomize trial . The consequence decision make individually , patient patient , reason patient identical echocardiographic/clinical characteristic might operate USA Europe ( part world ) , vice-versa . With experience accumulate far , retrospective observational data elective AVR might lead favorable outcome compare late ( symptom onset ) surgery . This may especially come attention understand annual risk sudden cardiac death asymptomatic severe AS patient normal LV EF might similar even bit higher operative mortality experience cardiac surgery center . Nevertheless , majority cardiologist worldwide reluctant send asymptomatic patient isolate severe AS normal LV EF AVR , probably stay like till randomize trial give u answer whether elective AVR beneficial .</detailed_description>
