	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect new combination treatment disease . In clinical trial , study treatment option currently ibrutinib plus R-GDP , R-GDP alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Combination Therapy Treatment Relapsed Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>R-GDP use treat many people lymphoma . Ibrutinib show benefit people certain type lymphoma . They previously give together . This research do try find new combination treatment may better treat patient disease . It clear however treatment offer good result standard treatment . The standard usual treatment disease treatment rituximab plus gemcitabine , dexamethasone , cisplatin ( R-GDP ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologic diagnosis one follow histology accord World Health Organization : document initial diagnosis relapse : Diffuse large cell lymphoma , Bcell ( include primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma , Tcell rich Bcell lymphoma ) ; Previous indolent lymphoma ( follicular lymphoma , marginal zone lymphoma , include extranodal MALT lymphoma , lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma ) transformation diffuse large Bcell lymphoma recent relapse ( biopsy proof transformation mandatory ) ; Unclassifiable Bcell lymphoma indeterminate feature diffuse large Bcell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma . Biopsy proof disease initial diagnosis mandatory . A biopsy relapse preferred mandatory . Participating centre must designate local reference expert pathologist confirm diagnosis patient enrol centre . Patients must CD20+ order eligible study . Clinically and/or radiologically measurable disease ( one site bidimensionally measurable ) . Measurements/ evaluation must do within 28 day prior randomization . Prior FDGPET scan , do baseline , must positive ( know FDGavid lymphoma ) Patient must least one previous regimen therapy disease . Patients must relapse progressed RCHOP chemotherapy equivalent . Patient age ≥16 year . Patients older 65 year age recommend study . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 3 . Patient must consider fit intensive chemotherapy ASCT , appropriate candidate receive secondline salvage chemotherapy ASCT . Life expectancy &gt; 90 day . Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 14 day randomization ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L ( independent growth factor support ) Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L ( 50 x 10^9/L bone marrow involvement lymphoma , independent transfusion support ) Biochemistry : AST ALT ≤ 3x ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN Gilberts Disease ) Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN ( estimate GFR ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73m2 use Cockcroft Gault formula ) . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use reliable form contraception study . Women child bear potential men sexually active must practice highly effective method birth control study consistent local regulation regard use birth control method subject participate clinical trial . Men must agree donate sperm study . These restriction apply 12 month ( 1 year ) last dose study drug . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take ( either serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ BhCG ] ) urine ) proven negative within 14 day prior randomization . Women pregnant breastfeeding ineligible study . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients randomized trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event , followup . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer superficial bladder cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix breast , localize excised prostate cancer , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year .

Patients require anticoagulation warfarin equivalent vitamin K antagonist ( e.g . phenprocoumon ) . History stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 6 month prior randomization Clinically significant cardiovascular disease uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month Screening , Class 3 ( moderate ) Class 4 ( severe ) cardiac disease define New York Heart Association Functional Classification . Any serious active disease comorbid medical condition , include psychiatric illness , judge local investigator preclude safe administration plan protocol treatment require followup . Any serious intercurrent illness , life threaten condition , organ system dysfunction , medical condition judge local investigator compromise subject 's safety , interfere absorption metabolism ibrutinib capsule , preclude safe administration plan protocol treatment require followup , include ( example ) : active , uncontrolled bacterial , fungal , viral infection ; clinically significant cardiac dysfunction cardiovascular disease .
