	<brief_summary>A large proportion Asian patient HCC present locally advanced metastatic disease , point ineligible curative treatments.Oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin intravenous infusion prove effective prolong progression-free survival ( PFS ) doxorubicin palliative chemotherapy patient advance HCC Asia . Besides , hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy ( HAIC）is widely use method primary metastasis liver tumor high local tumor response . To knowledge , prospective study assess safety effecacy HAIC use oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin patient locally advanced HCC.Thus , purpose phase 2 study ass safety effecacy HAIC use oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin patient locally advanced HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HAIC Using Oxaliplatin Plus Fluorouracil/Leucovorin Patients With Locally Advanced HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy worldwide much common male female . Each year , number patient HCC China alone contribute 50 % total case deaths world . In men , poor prognosis make HCC second frequent cause cancer-related mortality less developed country . Locally advanced metastatic disease find 60 % -70 % HCC patient time diagnose , median survival time 3-4 month due unavailability potentially curative therapy . Therefore , treatment control progression improve prognosis advanced HCC great need sufficient liver reservation . Recently , oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib , report significantly prolong overall survival ( OS ) delay disease progression patient advance HCC . To date , sorafenib still standard treatment advance HCC approve FDA . However , low response rate , modest survival advantage , high-level heterogeneity individual response relatively high cost , limitation sorafenib prohibit widespread use advance HCC alternative therapy highly required present . In fact , past 30 year , researcher never stop search effective chemotherapeutic agent HCC , wide spectrum cytotoxic drug report variety study , include doxorubicin , gemcitabine , capecitabine , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , cisplatin . Unfortunately , low heterogeneous response well-known toxic effect cause chemotherapy severely slow pace drug development HCC . Until last year , base multicenter randomize clinical trial know EACH study , Qin et al . report FOLFOX4 ( oxaliplatin [ OXA ] , leucovorin [ LV ] , 5-FU ) regimen associate significant well OS doxorubicin regimen ( 5.7 vs. 4.3 month ; hazard ratio : 0.74 ; P = 0.03 ) Chinese subgroup account 75 % EACH study population . This study provide proof suggest FOLFOX4 regimen may become potentially efficacious alternative doxorubicin Chinese patient advance HCC . However , systemic toxicity chemotherapy impair liver function still concern could neglect . Compared systemic chemotherapy , hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy ( HAIC ) provide chemotherapeutic agent liver high concentration lower toxicity report favor result patient advanced HCC . Additionally , patient initially eligible curative treatment , e.g. , resection liver transplantation , HAIC may disease stage offer chance undergo treatment give good long-term result . Though various agent 5-FU cisplatin study HAIC , far , data use effective regimen FOLFOX4 HAIC . Therefore , carry multi-center , prospective trial investigate effect safety HAI combine FOLFOX4 regimens Chinese population advance HCC .</detailed_description>
