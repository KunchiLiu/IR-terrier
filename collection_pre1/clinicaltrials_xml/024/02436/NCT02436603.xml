	<detailed_description>This project test effectiveness integrative medicine approach treat irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . Over course 18 month , recruit 85 participant IBS New York City . These participant randomize either 4-week group-oriented treatment intervention incorporate low FODMAP ( fermentable oligosaccharide , disaccharide , monosaccharide polyols ) diet mind-body therapy follow 8-week health coach follow-up period waitlist control group . At end 12-week study period , waitlist subject offer four-week nutrition mind-body intervention . Over 12-week study period , examine report impact treatment intervention IBS symptom quality life population . The investigator collect data IBS outcomes well depression stress . The hypothesis participant report decrease symptom improve function quality life result four-week nutrition mind-body intervention 8-week health coach follow-up period . The goal project develop low-cost , effective integrative intervention IBS , replicate setting across U.S . Objectives The purpose project examine whether low cost , group-oriented integrative medicine approach irritable bowel syndrome improve participant outcome . The intervention combine nutrition counsel low FODMAP diet mind-body train follow-up health coaching . The hypothesis participant report decrease symptom measure IBS Symptom Severity Score improve function quality life result intervention compare usual care . Background Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) chronic debilitate functional gastrointestinal disorder profound effect quality life ( QOL ) individual IBS . The estimated prevalence IBS general population range 3 % 20 % , study estimate IBS affect 10 % 15 % general population . Despite high level prevalence , exact cause IBS well understood . Researchers believe IBS cause wide variety mental physical health problem include hypersensitivity , brain-gut signal issue , bacterial gastroenteritis , depression , anxiety , food sensitivity , body chemical imbalance , and/or genetics . Background : Low FODMAP Diet IBS More 60 % IBS patient report worsen symptoms meal , 28 % within 15 minute eat 93 % within 3 hour . The role diet induce exacerbate IBS system explore decade . Numerous study examine role lactose intolerance fructose malabsorption IBS . Additional research oligosaccharides incompletely absorb sugar alcohol polyols , sorbitol , mannitol , reveal role IBS symptom . Grouping poorly absorb , short chain carbohydrates- fermentable oligosaccharide , disaccharide , monosaccharide polyols- accord chain length result acronym FODMAP , 2005 , first paper describe FODMAP hypothesis publish . Evidence continue accumulate consumption FODMAPs may contribute symptom individual IBS . FODMAPs poorly absorb , osmotically active , increase delivery water fermentable substrate proximal colon rapidly ferment bacteria . The poor absorption fermentation short chain carbohydrate contribute bloat , distension , abdominal pain , flatulence individual IBS . In comparison standard dietary advice versus FODMAP individual IBS , low FODMAP diet show significantly great reduction abdominal pain , bloating , flatulence compare standard dietary advice group . A high FODMAP diet alter pattern gas production , induce prolonged hydrogen production intestine great individual IBS versus healthy control , influence amount methane produce , induced gastrointestinal systemic symptom individual IBS . A low FODMAP diet reduce abdominal pain , bloating , flatulence , diarrhea individual inflammatory bowel disease . In prospective study 90 patient IBS follow 15 month , low FODMAP diet significantly decrease abdominal pain , bloating , flatulence , diarrhea , great improvement great dietary adherence . Background : Mind-Body Therapies IBS Psychological therapy mind-body therapy hypnosis , biofeedback , psychotherapy represent effective treatment IBS especially useful motivated patient moderate severe IBS . The scientific evidence involve mind-body therapy IBS begin 1927 American researcher , Dr. Edmund Jacobson , conduct first randomize trial use progressive relaxation IBS treatment find significant benefit . In recent year , vast majority research surround mind-body approach IBS come research group University Hospital South Manchester , UK lead Dr. Peter Whorwell . In 1984 , Whorwell group develop hypnosis procedure specifically treat IBS call `` gut direct hypnotherapy '' . The intervention consist seven half-hour session decrease frequency . In addition , patient give self-hypnosis tape daily practice . A 2005 review publish American Society Clinical Hypnosis examine 14 study measure efficacy mechanism hypnosis IBS treatment ( 12 14 study utilized adaptation Whorwell group procedure ) . Based study investigate , review conclude `` hypnosis consistently produce significant result improve cardinal symptom IBS majority patient . '' A separate 2006 review conduct researcher University Birmingham England , conclude exist scientific evidence suggest hypnosis effective treatment management IBS ( 10 18 study examine indicated significant benefit ) . Regarding long-term benefit , exist scientific evidence supportive mind-body approach IBS treatment . A long-term follow-up study IBS patient ( n=204 ) treat hypnosis reveal 71 % initially respond hypnosis , 81 % maintain improvement overtime remain 19 % report slight deterioration IBS symptom . Also important patient report use few medication manage IBS follow hypnosis treatment . In conclusion , study author determine benefit hypnosis seem last 5 year treatment . A 1989 comparative study England determine hypnosis treatment IBS group 8 patient effective individual therapy .</detailed_description>
