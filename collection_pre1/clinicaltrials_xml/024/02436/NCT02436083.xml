	<detailed_description>Study Design Patient Recruitment All clinical investigation conduct accord principle express Declaration Helsinki . Patient consent write . Any patient require reconstructive surgery oncological reason within oral cavity microvascular free flap eligible . Patients receive preoperative neoadjuvant previous adjuvant radiation therapy medical history include study protocol available comparable dos effect irradiate tissue.14 A prospective study initiate July 2007 June 2012 . All patient prospectively evaluate . Postoperative Care The investigator standard regimen keep patient sedate one night intensive care unit transfer surgical ward . The specific intravenous antibiotic therapy start 30 minute operation administer 10 day . Data Analysis Recorded parameter include : age , sex , preoperative medical history , American society Anesthesiologists classification preoperative status 15 , diagnosis , stage disease , defect localisation , type microvascular free flap , choice recipient vessel , flap success , rate number operative revision , primary secondary reconstruction , type previous treatment ( radiation surgery ) , type previous neck dissection ( ) , microvascular complication , total operative time , wound heal disturbance subdivide dehiscence infection neck , region reconstruction , donor site , prophylactic antibiotic agent , use . Infection define purulent discharge wound . Descriptive statistic quantitative variable give mean ± standard deviation . The data analyze `` Statistical Package Social Sciences '' software ( IBM® SPSS® Statistics Windows , Version 22.0 ; IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Figures generate SPSS Microsoft® Office Excel ( Microsoft Excel Windows , release 11.0 , 2003 , Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA , USA ) .
