	<brief_summary>The literature outcome measure assess upper limb Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) quite scanty . While considerable advance ambulant DMD boy , prospective study far devote outcome measure non ambulant patient , increase complaint family patient . This information appear highly important well understanding progression disease also possible enrollment patient future trial . The aim project identify outcome measure non ambulant patient Italian population DMD patient . At least 200 non ambulant DMD boys adult include study . All patient assess use newly develop Performance Upper limb ( PUL ) test . This measure use baseline 6 12 month baseline . This allow monitor possible change time rate change patient different level ability age . As part study investigator also correlate possible change upper limb function measure care function EK scale . The investigator aim assess suitability individual measure large number patient , try establish whether whole scale individual item appear relevant across age level ability . The investigator also aim assess suitability select measure multicentric set quantity training require The data collect also analyse use Rasch analysis order improve statistical property measure use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicentric study involve large number patient could collect single Unit . The aim project collect large number patient allow assess suitability different measure assess upper limb function . As DMD relatively rare condition , goal reach multicentric setting . All participate centre ( Rome Gemelli , Messina , Rome Bambin Ges√π , Pavia , Genoa , Naples , Turin , Bologna , Padua , Milan , Bosisio Parini , Pisa ) good record cooperation similar project already involved validation North Star DMD Hammersmith Functional motor Scale SMA . The project develop different step , relate different specific aim : 1 . Interobserver reliability/quality quantity train One aim study assess reliability select measure multicentric set quantity training required sure reliability among observer train session . Following experience train North Star Ambulatory Assessment ( NSAA ) network , investigator become aware single training session may sufficient sure interobserver reliability maintain training session ( Mazzone et al , 2009 ) . 2 . Natural history data collection The PUL apply whole cohort repeat assessment 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . This allow monitor possible change time rate change patient different level ability age . This also help evaluate responsiveness change level sensitivity measure interval would useful study putative agent could improve muscle power . 3 . Correlation measure Another aim study relate possible change upper limb function measure care function EK scale , provide information aspect function , transfer self feed important everyday life . Correlation respiratory function also perform . 4. improve statistical property scale . There increase evidence last year Rasch analysis may help improvethe statistical property . The data collect offer opportunity perform new psychometric technique .</detailed_description>
