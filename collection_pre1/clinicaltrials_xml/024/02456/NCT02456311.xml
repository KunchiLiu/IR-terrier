	<brief_summary>VATS anatomical lung resection provide effective minimally invasive treatment strategy stage I II lung cancer . VATS lobectomy associate significantly less postoperative atrial fibrillation , blood transfusion , renal failure , complication compare lobectomy via thoracotomy . Although VATS lobectomy proven effective safe experience hand , devoid risk . Intra-operative surgical complication time catastrophic . Complications include : pulmonary vascular injury ( PA , pulmonary vein ) necessitate urgent conversion open thoracotomy even death14 . Causes conversion include PA injury , difficult anatomy , bulky/calcified lymph node , technical problem include stapler misfire . PA injury alone constitute 37.5 % conversion . Proper dissection tissue around PA branch sometime difficult especially presence adhesion large , calcified lymph node may increase risk vascular injury . Currently , spite safe effective technique experience hand , minority anatomical pulmonary resection perform VATS . In analysis utilizing Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) database United States , 15 % anatomical lung resection perform VATS . The technical difficulty danger VATS lobectomy directly relate PA branch manipulation , staple division . PA manipulation main hesitation many thoracic surgeon regard adoption VATS lobectomy . The investigator believe decrease manipulation dissection require surgeon PA branch , procedure safe therefore prevalent anatomical pulmonary resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist pilot study evaluate feasibility energy seal lobar PA branch lobectomy human . All patient plan undergo open lobectomy CHUM - Hôpital Notre-Dame approach attempt enroll pilot study . In investigator 's institution , lobectomies either do open ( thoracotomy ) minimally invasive approach , know VATS ( video assist thoracoscopic surgery ) . This decision base surgeon , tumor size , tumor localization patient characteristic . Only patient already plan open lobectomy approach . Potential patient identify go operation request form . Patients book open lobectomy approach either preoperative clinic day surgery , admit . Goal recruit 10 patient .</detailed_description>
