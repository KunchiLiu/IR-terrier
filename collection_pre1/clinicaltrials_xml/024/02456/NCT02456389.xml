	<brief_title>Perioperative Risk Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major cancer surgery associate significant rate postoperative mortality major morbidity . Postoperative morbidity adversely impact healthcare utilization , healthcare cost , rate discharge home , quality life , rate receipt postoperative anti-neoplastic therapy , disease-free survival , overall survival . The investigator hypothesize perioperative risk stratification risk-based , protocol-driven management ( compare standard perioperative management ) lead reduction 30-day post-operative mortality major morbidity patient undergo major cancer surgery . This base theory preoperative/postoperative use newly develop , perioperative risk-prediction tool help identify patient increase risk postoperative death serious complication might benefit risk-based , protocol-driven perioperative management , include escalating level care , escalate level monitoring , escalate level hospitalist co-management . The set assessment intervention propose study conceptually similar `` bundle '' intervention recently recently test demonstrate reduce perioperative mortality morbidity .</detailed_description>
