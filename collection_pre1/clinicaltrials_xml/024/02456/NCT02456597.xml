	<brief_summary>To investigate function novel catheter continuous peripheral nerve block popliteal nerve : Two key issue investigate 1 ) Successful primary placement function catheter continuous peripheral nerve block confirm decrease motor function follow injection local analgesic catheter ; 2 ) The rate displacement standardize movement limb catheter continuous peripheral nerve block insert .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Concept Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block - Sciatic Nerve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although peripheral nerve block know provide superior postoperative analgesia . Continuous peripheral nerve block ( CPNB ) use extent deserve . This predominantly due variable success rate . Furthermore , exist technique place catheter CPNBs technically complicate time consuming.4,5 Major problem include difficult insertion catheter tip past needle , difficult visualization catheter advancement , secondary displacement local anesthetic ( LA ) injection orifice ( ) limit possibility reposition catheter leave situ . We develop new catheter CPNBs address overcome limitation . Hence , new catheter primarily provide precise initial placement catheter , less risk secondary displacement possibility readjust new catheter time point initial placement . Furthermore , in-plane ultrasound ( US ) visualization entire procedure readjustment possible . The new catheter also provide simple rapid technique component . Initial proof concept study cadaver promise success rate close 100 % initial placement readjustment</detailed_description>
