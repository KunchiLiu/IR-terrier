	<brief_summary>This study conduct pilot test feasibility , usability , acceptability , clinical utility use virtual reality ( VR ) immersion experience inpatient set . In addition determine whether patient enjoy experience would like participate future tailor immersion virtual reality , attempt determine whether positive impact visit , include distraction pain anxiety associate procedure reason admit hospital . Because inpatient population Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ( CSMC ) dynamic diagnostically diverse , intend develop series VR intervention broadly address patient concern . VR test select patient population , equally interested feasibility deploy VR across inpatient hospital environment demonstrate effectiveness reduce pain anxiety , improve satisfaction . The present study follow aim : 1 . Adapting exist VR environment inpatient variety impairment , utilize cost-effective VR hardware ( Phase 1 ) . 2 . Assess usability acceptability VR equipment software hospital inpatient conduct qualitative interview ( Phase 2 ) . 3 . Assess clinical utility VR intervention measure patient report outcome use modify care satisfaction survey , administer inpatient receive VR match control sample ( Phase 3 ) . Concerning Aims 2 3 , hypothesize following : 1 . Inpatients find VR intervention helpful enjoyable , believe benefit outweigh difficulty encounter use hardware software . 2 . Inpatients expose VR intervention report significantly improve pain management , great satisfaction inpatient visit , great overall health compare match control inpatient expose VR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance Virtual Reality ( VR ) technology make possible researcher develop intervention wide variety disease state , include obesity , pain , impaired motor functioning , anxiety . Over last decade , improvement software hardware design , well associate cost reduction , make VR practical tool widespread use , rather expensive novelty . Interventions would possible practical real world develop virtual world , result immersive multi-sensory ( primarily audio-visual ) experience distract patient painful experience motivate achieve personal goal . VR environment allow patient visualize non-disease state , practice live healthily , whether focus stroke rehabilitation , exposure therapy social anxiety , simply interact world reduce pain level . A number study demonstrate efficacy VR intervention , build around basic premise . For example , meta-analysis diagnosis-specific exposure therapy anxiety disorder - PTSD , agoraphobia/panic disorder , social anxiety , animal phobia ) report large effect ( Cohen 's Q-statistic &gt; 0.80 ) VR intervention symptom report therapy termination.1 Similarly , meta-analysis post-stroke motor rehabilitation VR intervention report , observational study , patient experience significantly reduce impairment ( 14.7 % ) improve motor functioning ( 20.1 % ) . Hospital inpatient likely benefit VR distraction acute pain procedure , painful drug infusion , adverse side effect treatment , boredom inactivity , could lead increase report distress reduce satisfaction care . Several area research may provide useful model bring VR distraction intervention type hospital inpatient . A recent review Li colleague ( 2012 ) highlight advance treatment area . To date , widely study form VR intervention reduction pain anxiety associate burn care . Compared use analgesic medication alone , patient use VR distraction intervention combination analgesic drug report reduced pain distress burn wound care across study , low pain rating increase range motion physical therapy study . Use VR distraction environment call SnowWorld - develop H.G . Hoffman colleague , employ across many study - allow burn patient move ice canyon play snow . Additions VR hypnosis relaxation module SnowWorld also test burn patient , mixed result ; patient undergo hypnosis report low pain anxiety level , undergo relaxation receive morphine report high pain level . Studies cancer patient demonstrate efficacy use VR patient receive chemotherapy lumbar puncture . Although pain score often reduce direction favor use VR , study date demonstrate conclusive , long term benefit symptom reduction . However , patient report short perceived time treatment , reduce physiological arousal treatment , low perceive pain treatment . During routine medical procedure , VR deliver via head-mounted display demonstrate promising effect . In study outpatient blood drawn , receive immersive VR report low level moderate severe pain . In similar study patient IV place CT scan contrast , receive VR report change pain level , compare standard care patient report four-fold increase pain . VR also use treatment chronic pain . In sample adult chronic neck pain , use VR mirror visual feedback environment result promising non-significant report pain reduction . In another study patient chronic neck pain , single session VR encourage increase range motion ( spray fly ) . Notably , many study ( except chronic neck pain patient ) conduct use child adolescent population . This group may receptive VR , give common exposure video game screen-based entertainment . Nevertheless , use VR patient study , intervention may present novel cost-effective method improve patient experience satisfaction . VR intervention use distraction diversion medical procedure . This study one first test feasibility deploy low-cost VR intervention nonsurgical inpatient hospital setting . The VR hardware configuration software currently develop AppliedVR , leader development medical application virtual reality technology , include intervention weight loss health , safety training , education , personal development .</detailed_description>
