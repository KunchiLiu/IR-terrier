	<detailed_description>This project one nine project four translational platform form core interdisciplinary consortium research important area uncertainty unmet need early recognition diagnostic assessment , prevention relapse , therapeutic strategy BD . Within project , currently use diagnostic tool subthreshold bipolar symptom ( BPSS-P , EPIbipolar , BAR criterion ) deploy within first 24 month define risk group . Predictive power individual risk factors/risk constellation determine regard manifestation prodromal development BD within ≥24 month ( follow-up every 6 month ) . Potential resilience factor ascertain . Additionally , diagnostic tool use representative cohort ( IMAGEN , ascertain prevalence clinical/neurobiological at-risk constellation non-selected youth young adult , data previous follow-up use , suffering/help-seeking behavior assess ) . Regarding treatment , at-risk subject identify stag accord pilot stag model . Treatment guidance provide link model , however , naturalistic setting allow individual decision making . Reasons decision ascertain , efficacy assess respect symptomatology , psychosocial functioning conversion full BD , tolerability/safety assess accord research standard . Outcomes assess within ≥ 24 month . Using result , clinical stag model &amp; guidance refine . The long-term goal provide model research clinical initiative . Synopsis study goal : 1 . Determination predictive power individual risk factor risk constellation define risk group BD , 2 . Identification resilience factor , 3 . Integration result development diagnostic tool harmonization diagnostic process across center , 4 . Investigation process treatment decision making , efficacy ( acute/preventive effect ) tolerability/safety at-risk subject naturalistic setting , test feasibility pilot clinical stag model treatment guidance , 5 . Refinement stag model guidance .</detailed_description>
