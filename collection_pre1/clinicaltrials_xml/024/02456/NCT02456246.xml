	<brief_summary>Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) emerge one lead curative method early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , assess status disease post-SBRT follow present challenge . Currently , chest Computed Tomography ( CT ) main technique detect whether cancer come back , method demonstrate poor accuracy reliability determine observe post-operative lung change benign malignant . Positron-emission tomography ( PET ) imaging technique use special radioactive tracer cell growth . The use PET scan tracer target pathway DNA synthesis may accurate CT detect cancer come . The purpose study see PET radiotracer call 18F-FLT ( 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine ) identify cancer recurrences accurately compare regular CT scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) demonstrate impressive 3-year control rate high 90 % early stage NSCLC , lead increase use technique curative method lung cancer treatment . With grow clinical experience technique , post-SBRT follow receive attention . Follow SBRT do primarily thorax CT , affect radiation-induced radiographic lung change resemble obscure local recurrence . FLT ( 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine ) thymidine analogue non-toxic tracer dos , label 18F . FLT-PET type imaging ( similar concept widely use 18-FDG PET-CT ) base integration thymidine DNA assessment proliferation . Conceptually , increase DNA synthesis correlate tumor aggressiveness response therapy , glucose utilization - FDG-PET could . The purpose study therefore see added information use FTL-PET provide distinguishing change lung occur result treatment cancerous due recurrence progressive disease .</detailed_description>
