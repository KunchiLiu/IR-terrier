	<brief_summary>Background When first diagnose , colorectal cancer already metastasize 20 % patient liver ( term synchronous disease ) . For patient metastatic disease limit liver , major surgery resect primary colorectal cancer liver metastasis provide 5-year survival rate 25-40 % . Conventional surgery remove colorectal primary first , follow adjuvant chemotherapy , resection liver metastasis . Surgical advance make synchronous resection ( remove primary liver metastasis together ) liver-first resection possible . Currently , conclusive evidence show approach improve morbidity survival , therefore optimum clinical pathway . Treatment decide multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) meeting dependent multiple factor : cancer staging , patient health preference , clinical experience . Methods `` Colorectal cancer Synchronous liver-limited hepatic Metastasis : Inception Cohort ( CoSMIC ) '' , consent recruit patient new diagnosis synchronous colorectal cancer limit liver . Patients recruit Manchester Royal Infirmary ( National Health Service ( NHS ) regional cancer-network approve Hepato-pancreato-biliary specialist center 2 year use standardize data collection . The sequence treatment receive patient , factor influence treatment decision , record evaluate European Society Medical Oncology guideline . The effect surgery patient quality life , morbidity , mortality long-term outcome measure compare different treatment sequence adjust prognostic factor . Anticipated Outputs Value Findings Direct comparison conventional new surgical sequence explore . Patient engagement , use standardise recording , identify common clinical pattern decision making , understanding source variation essential step develop definite randomize control trial resolve optimal clinical pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients present metastatic liver disease follow treatment primary ( term metachronous disease ) receive care focus new metastatic disease . In contrast , management patient present colorectal cancer concurrent liver metastasis ( synchronous metastasis ) complex . These patient may less favourable cancer biology thus may less likely become long-term survivor . Logically , management patient colorectal cancer synchronous metastasis dichotomise hepatic disease together extra-hepatic metastatic disease liver-limited metastatic disease . In first category , systemic chemotherapy mainstay treatment advocate current guideline patient advance multi-site metastatic ( liver systemic metastatic ) disease colorectal cancer origin . The second category patient liver-limited synchronous metastasis represent complex common clinical management problem . Traditional management ( refer variously classical stag approach ) comprise resection colorectal primary tumour follow adjuvant chemotherapy liver resection undertaken subsequent operation . Advances surgery , anaesthesia critical care make two alternative option feasible patient synchronous disease . The first synchronous resection liver metastases colorectal primary . This attraction remove macroscopic tumour burden single operation . However , morbidity complex liver resection combine major bowel resection may considerable evidence negative effect progression-free survival . The second option management synchronous disease resection liver metastatic disease first step , term reverse liver-first approach . Liver-first surgery manage synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastatic disease become widely utilised oncological technical development . Oncologically , evidence improve outcome locally advanced rectal cancer treat pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy prior surgical resection create potential `` window '' liver resection may undertake . The technical development colonic stenting permit symptom associated rectal cancer partial obstruction palliate without recourse urgent bowel surgery . The liver-first strategy may oncologically advantageous liver metastatic disease rather primary cancer give rise systemic metastasis - although establish . A potentially important benefit liver-first approach pelvic surgery may either avoid less extensive patient rectal tumour complete endoscopic , radiological clinical response chemo-radiotherapy . Currently , evidence inadequate inform selection treatment patient colorectal cancer synchronous liver-limited hepatic metastasis . Specifically , patient , optimal pathway define dearth prospectively record cohort- defining factor influence treatment selection outcome . Given treatment permutation understood , inception cohort study would allow u understand patient outcome function clinical decision patient/disease characteristic . By limit care available patient common evidence-informed pathway , source treatment variation minimise , within prospective design , data quality optimise respect patient treatment characteristic . Following informed consent recruitment , data collect patient colorectal cancer liver-limited hepatic metastasis include patient variable , treatment selection , factor influence treatment , treatment-related morbidity outcome . Regression model finding permit influence patient treatment factor upon outcome quantify . Patterns clinical decision make help understand characteristic patient equipoise exist absent .</detailed_description>
