	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Magnesium Alloy Screw Novel Bioabsorbable Material Patients Due Hand Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Hand fracture include intra- extra-articular phalanx metacarpal common account approximately 40 % upper extremity fracture lead functional loss hand.Fractures treat conservatively nonsurgical approach ( Closed reduction ) place damage figure splint ; may result displacement , rotation , angulation and/or instability , therefore require surgery . Surgical technique treatment hand fracture include internal fixation metal plate screw Open reduction external fixation insertion percutaneous pin screw . Percutaneous external fixation one widely use method , difficult maintain accompany unstable fracture soft tissue injury severely comminute fracture sometimes result restrict motion adjacent joint due prolonged fixation . In comparison , internal fixation operation use internal fixators plate , wire , screw etc . solely concurrently depend location severity hand fracture . With recent advancement implant design fixation technique , variety screw widely use fixation small-bone fracture . The present study design evaluate efficacy safety magnesium alloy screw novel bioabsorbable biodegradable material . Study Duration : After approval clinical protocol MFDS Korea , total 20 month require include 14 month subject enrollment 6 month follow-up . An additional 1 month require completion study handle data , statistical analysis preparation study report . Target Subjects : Patients require internal fixation use screw due hand fracture Investigational Device : K-METâ„¢ Bioresorbable Bone screw ( manufacture U &amp; I ) This device divide two type , Cortex screw Headless compression screw . Number Subjects : A total 34 case bone fracture 28 subject .</detailed_description>
