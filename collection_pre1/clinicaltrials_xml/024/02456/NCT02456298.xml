	<detailed_description>Managing challenge behavior autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) profoundly improve quality life child family . However , many family lack access research-based treatment , apply behavior analysis ( ABA ) . This study randomize trial compare outcome treatment ASD use either standard Functional Analysis Plus Functional Communication Training ( FA+FCT ) package pragmatic version offer briefer , less time-intensive model FA+FCT . Both type FA+FCT provide via telehealth family home maximize generalizability real-life setting . Providing ABA telehealth make effective treatment accessible across geographic barrier child exclude base live . The study also examine key family factor influence successful outcomes . The study 3 primary aim : ( 1 ) To assess outcomes ABA telehealth assign child either Pragmatic FA+FCT group group receive Standard FA+FCT . Outcomes compare base percent reduction problem behavior , communication increase , time achieve outcome , treatment fidelity , family acceptance treatment , generalization maintenance treatment gain . ( 2 ) The study assess relation family factor treatment efficacy acceptability assess parent stress , mood , social support relation outcome . ( 3 ) Cost effectiveness assess relation treatment method use efficiency ABA telehealth . The study include 102 child meet eligibility criterion among large sample 150 child . Thirty-six child receive intervention three state : Iowa , Georgia , Texas . Study design randomize trial use intent-to-treat analysis . Half sample randomize Pragmatic FA+FCT half Standard FA+FCT . Treatment provide via telehealth use FCT , function-based ABA technique parent trained therapist direction behavior consultant . Study procedures typically complete within 6 month , follow-up assessment occur 6 month treatment completion . Data analysis include comparison assessment group , single-case design examine response individual child , cost analysis , regression analysis effect family factor outcomes . The investigator prior research show problem behavior reduce 90 % child ASD 4-6 month telehealth treatment . If Pragmatic FA+FCT reduce problem behavior rate comparable Standard FA+FCT , treatment start sooner family achieve successful outcome low cost . Although pragmatic FA+FCT provide less behavioral information , may resistant treatment relapse involve reinforce high rate problem behavior .</detailed_description>
