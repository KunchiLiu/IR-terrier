	<brief_title>Effect Oxcarbazepine Serum Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder ( BD ) chronic psychiatric illness partially unknown pathophysiology . BD likely involves , molecular cellular level , dysfunction critical neurotrophic , cellular plasticity resilience pathway neuroprotective process . Abnormalities neurotrophins ( NTs ) trophic factor orchestrate important alteration could implicate etiology BD . As consistently report post-mortem study , modification generally associate disruption distinct subregions function brain , one deregulation neurotrophins . NTs capable signal neuron , glial cell cellular system enable survival , differentiation growth . BDNF one study abundant NTs brain , play important role variety neural process development animal human . Initially , BDNF important neurogenesis , neuronal survival , normal maturation neural development pathway . In adult , BDNF important synaptic plasticity dendritic growth , also long-term memory consolidation . Several study prove BDNF significantly reduce manic , hypomanic depressive stage BD , whereas euthymic patient exhibit BDNF level similar healthy control . Rafael T. de Sousa et al observe significant increase serum BDNF level 28 day lithium monotherapy patient BD suggest neuroprotective role lithium due direct regulatory effect BDNF . Oxcarbazepine commonly use mood stabilizer demonstrate comparable efficacy divalproate sodium well tolerability profile till date study effect BDNF . The aim present study evaluate change serum BDNF level oxcarbazepine monotherapy bipolar disorder explore possibility neuroprotective effect .</detailed_description>
