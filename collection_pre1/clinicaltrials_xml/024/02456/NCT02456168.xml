	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment occur many 80 % lupus patient affective disorder , depression anxiety , also common . Both problem contribute significantly disease burden disability . Associations serum anti-NMDAR Aab cognitive behavioral change human SLE remain controversial , however , elevate titer Aabs cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) correlate severe central nervous system manifestation , coma psychosis . The aim study progression disease ( cognitive behavioral impairment ) 2 year period SLE subject neuropsychologic behavioral test correlate disease progression use rest FDG-PET serum Anti-NMDAR Aab . The correlation hippocampal hypermetabolism , Anti-NMDAR Aab memory impairment observe cross-sectional study validate baseline measurement propose study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Novel Glutamate Receptor Ligand PET Scans Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropsychiatric lupus comprise numerous , complex central peripheral nervous system symptom whose pathophysiologic mechanism remain poorly understood . Cross-reactive anti-dsDNA antibody show bind NR2A/NR2B subunits N-methyl D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) neuron synergize glutamate concentration dependent manner either modulate receptor function cause excitotoxic , non-inflammatory neuronal death . Mice immunize express anti-NMDAR Aab demonstrate causal relationship anti-NMDAR Aab persistent behavioral cognitive neuropathology follow compromise blood brain barrier ( BBB ) necessary Aab access brain . The investigator ' previous cross-sectional FDG-PET study rest brain glucose metabolism demonstrate robust hypermetabolism hippocampus SLE subject associate independently serum Anti-NMDAR Aab titer impair memory . Moreover , combination hippocampus hypermetabolism elevate serum titer Anti-NMDAR Aab higher predictive value memory impairment either variable alone . These significant correlation must test longitudinal study evaluate utility FDG-PET biomarker Anti-NMDAR Aab-mediated brain damage . The propose longitudinal study inform investigator correlate cognitive behavioral change time use FDG-PET imaging ( Aim 1 ) . Additionally , investigator explore NMDAR biology novel PET ligand , [ 11C ] -CNS5161 , use localize quantify NMDAR activation ( Aim 2 ) explore role blood brain barrier ( BBB ) integrity cognitive behavioral impairment ( Aim 3 ) .</detailed_description>
