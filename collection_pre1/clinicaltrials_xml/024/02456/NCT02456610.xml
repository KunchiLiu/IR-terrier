	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) cause significant morbidity mortality hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) patient China . Antiviral drug give either prophylactically early therapy patient detectable viral load appear effective strategy reduce viral infection . However , long-term treatment drug associate significant toxicity , expense appearance drug resistant virus isolate ultimately resulting treatment failure . CMV EBV specific T cell infusion immunocompromised patient follow HSCT able induce successful anti-viral response . The primary purpose study determine safety efficacy infusion CMV EBV specific cytotoxic T cell ( CTLs ) patient CMV EBV reactivation infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration Virus Specific CTLs Prophylaxis Treatment EBV/CMV Infections After HSCT China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To generate CMV/EBV specific CTLs , G-CSF mobilize hemopoietic progenitor cell ( G-HPC ) product nonmobilized peripheral blood apheresis collecting stimulate CMV/EBV specific peptide cover HLA allele among Chinese population . Once investigator make sufficient number T cell , test ex vivo properties.Then fraction CTLs separate immediate infusion others frozen infusion . If donor available , donor derive CTLs start produce CMV reactivation detect qPCR recipient peripheral blood . Otherwise , autologous CTLs use . For patient high risk develop CMV/EBV infection stem cell transplantation , small part G-HPC product extract CTLs generation .</detailed_description>
