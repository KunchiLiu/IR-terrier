	<brief_summary>The International Continence Society ( ICS ) define overactive bladder ( OAB ) clinical syndrome characterize urgency without urge incontinence , usually accompany frequency nocturia , since absence prove infection pathology relate . The negative impact quality life patient OAB already know . The etiology pathophysiology OAB completely understand . However , study indicate alteration sympathetic parasympathetic nerve stimulation involve mechanism OAB . A Transcutaneous Electrical stimulation Tibial Nerve ( TENS ) study noninvasive inexpensive , treat symptom syndrome therapeutic way . However , study literature evaluate effect electroconvulsive therapy mechanism involve sympathetic parasympathetic modulation woman . The objective study investigate effect TENS sympathetic parasympathetic system woman OAB . This randomized , double -blind , assess , first , pilot study , 30 female patient OAB randomly allocate 2 group : TENS group placebo group . Interventions take place one day assessment sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system perform . After collect data analyze accordance statistical analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects TENS Autonomous System Women With Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis True : Electrical stimulation tibial nerve ( TENS ) decrease activity parasympathetic nervous system increase activity sympathetic nervous system woman overactive bladder . Null Hypothesis : The electrical stimulation tibial nerve ( TENS ) decrease activity parasympathetic nervous system increase activity sympathetic nervous system woman overactive bladder . Alternative Hypothesis : The electrical stimulation tibial nerve ( TENS ) increase activity parasympathetic nervous system decrease activity sympathetic nervous system woman overactive bladder . Intervention Programmes The randomization technique carry sequential number keep opaque envelope , translucent close . This take account major goal randomization prevent researcher identify intervention perform patient . The generation sequence number make researcher `` blind '' study patient selection criterion inclusion exclusion . The sequence number use randomization keep confidential exact moment begin intervention . In study , two self-adhesive electrode , one immediately behind medial malleolus 10 cm use . Through chain 1Hz , aim correctly identify tibial nerve . This position confirm rhythmic movement finger flexion . The frequency change 10Hz , pulse width set 200 `` microsecond '' adjust accord intensity threshold patient , motor threshold . This current generator also device , VIF ( variation intensity frequency ) aim ease accommodation sensory receptor enhance effect . The application time 30 minute . The placebo group receive active current 30 second gradually decrease 15 second pass current . It noteworthy study participant instruct eat , drink , smoke exercise two hour prior data collection . Evaluation sympathetic parasympathetic system For analysis Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) time series RR interval obtain continuous ECG signal record ( sample frequency = 1 kHz ) MP150 system ( Biopac , California , USA ) interpolate decimated obtain equally spaced time series subject Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) algorithm develop use Matlab ( Matlab 6.0 , Mathworks Inc. , USA ) language . The spectral power calculate integrating frequency band interest . The time series RR analyze time domain frequency variability parameter autonomic balance obtain . In time domain calculate mean value RR interval , standard deviation square root sum square successive difference ( rMSSD ) . The evaluation sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system hold Federal University Health Sciences Porto Alegre ( UFCSPA ) , Laboratory Physiology , application TENS . Calculation Sample Due lack study relate study effect sympathetic parasympathetic TENS woman overactive bladder nervous system , pilot study conduct consist : Group A : TENS Group , compose 15 woman overactive bladder Group B : placebo group , consist 15 woman overactive bladder . Based obtained value actual sample size calculation study conduct .</detailed_description>
