	<brief_title>A Prospective European Post-Market Clinical Evaluation CuraSeal Percutaneous Intraluminal Closure System Anorectal Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective post-market study generate clinical data evaluate performance safety PICS AF device treatment anorectal fistula compare success rate fistula closure historical control commercially available device anorectal fistula repair perform participate clinical site . Data obtain study support safety effectiveness PICS AF device promote fistula closure heal . PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT : Fistula closure success 6 month define complete heal fistula tract associate external opening without drainage abscess . Fistula closure success PICS-AF device assess 6 month follow visit use MRI . The rate PICS-AF closure success 6 month compare closure rate obtain historical control follow similar time period . PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT : The proportion subject experience serious adverse event ( i.e. , infection , enlargement fistula , allergic reaction PICS-AF device , etc . ) 6 month post-procedure follow-up . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS : 1 . Fistula closure 3 month post-procedure determined physical examination . 2 . The cessation egress enteric fluid fistula tract stable complete closure mucosal internal fistula open physical examination . 3 . Safety post-procedure 3-month follow-up period . 4 . Infection ( e.g. , systemic abscess ) . 5 . Time fistula closure . 6 . Need repeat procedure require surgical intervention . 7 . Incontinence level treatment . 8 . Quality life assessment treatment .</detailed_description>
