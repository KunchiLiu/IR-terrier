	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study determine whether adipose tissue lose ability expand response overfeed old compare young men . The investigator hypothesize adipose tissue response overfeeding may weaken old compare young men , thereby lead worsen ectopic storage depot old men .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expandability Aging Adipose Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study begin address whether adipose tissue biology change advance age . Specifically , test whether adipose tissue lose ability expand response overfeed old compare young men . To test possibility Investigators recruit overweight mildly obese old ( age 55-75y ) young ( age 25-40y ) men collect adipose tissue biopsy 7 day overfeed . The investigator test well cell adipose tissue expand response overfeed whether differs young old men .</detailed_description>
