	<brief_summary>Pancreatic Cancer lead cause cancer-related death . To date , one fifth patient diagnosis present resectable diagnosis often delay make 5-year survival disease globally le 5 % . An early diagnosis patient currently possible give economic disadvantage population-wide screen . New evidence identify patient new-onset diabetes subgroup patient high risk develop disease ( RR 5:38 ) . In subset patient mediator secrete tumor , Adrenomedullin , could responsible onset diabetes . Our goal therefore assess different impact Pancreatic Cancer depend Adrenomedullin value patient newly diagnose diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study define prospective observational . The research project involve recruitment prospectively consecutive patient age 45 75 year receive new diagnosis diabetes , accord criterion establish American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) ( fast glucose great equal 126 mg / dl , random blood glucose great equal 200 mg / dl , glycated hemoglobin great equal 6.25 % ) . The recruitment take place Sant'Andrea Hospital . The suitability subject include study evaluate medical history , physical examination investigation carry medical researcher team , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The research team multidisciplinary , translational , compose medical specialist belong department General Surgery , Internal Medicine , Diabetology Occupational Medicine . An informed consent mandatory recruitment study . At recruitment Adrenomedullin serum level record along every relevant clinical laboratory data . An annual telephone follow-up applied necessary patient benefit outpatient examination . A sample size 440 patient achieve 80 % power detect statistically significant difference . The 3 year clinical follow-up allow detection symptom sign could relate presence pancreatic mass ( jaundice , pain , weight loss ) , investigation follow case confirm Pancreatic cancer diagnosis proceed treatment .</detailed_description>
