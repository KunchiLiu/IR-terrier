	<brief_summary>The combination breast conserving surgery ( lumpectomy ) radiation therapy show result equivalent overall survival rate compare mastectomy local treatment breast cancer . As result , majority patient diagnose breast cancer United States undergo lumpectomy primary surgical therapy . Multiple study demonstrate association positive lumpectomy margin increase risk ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence , even postoperative radiation . Studies report 20-40 % lumpectomy procedures result one involve ( positive ) surgical margin , lead need surgery , emotional distress , poor cosmesis , delay adjuvant treatment , increase cost . Current available intraoperative margin assessment technique include specimen Xray , gross pathology , frozen section , touch prep cytology . To reduce incidence positive margin , MarginProbe ( Dune Medical Devices , Caesarea , Israel ) develop provide real-time , intraoperative assessment presence tumor lumpectomy margin . In current study , investigator aim determine effectiveness MarginProbe adjunctive tool standard practice intraoperative identification tumor lumpectomy margin , ability reduce positive margin decrease need additional surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Outcomes Intraoperative Margin Assessment With MarginProbe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current study , investigator aim determine effectiveness MarginProbe adjunctive tool standard practice intraoperative identification tumor lumpectomy margin , ability reduce positive margin decrease need additional surgical procedure . Aims study : Primary objective 1 . Determine positive margin rate follow lumpectomy Secondary objective 1 . Determine accuracy intraoperative margin assessment use MarginProbe plus standard care ( gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen Xray ) versus standard care ( gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen Xray ) alone . 2 . Determine impact MarginProbe total tissue volume remove 3 . Determine impact MarginProbe need additional surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
