	<brief_title>Efficiency Study About Effect Acupuncture Postoperative Pain After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Patients Methods 1.1 All patient treat Medical University Vienna receive TKA due advance gonarthrosis . The study include male female patient . Every patient admit TKA ( Total knee arthroplasty ) implant invite take part study . Exclusion criterion : renal insufficiency , cardial insufficiency , coronary heart disease , use morphine , hydrocodones , benzodiazepine surgery . 1.2 The acupuncture carry use sterile disposable acupuncture needle , steel copper coil , size 0.25 x 30 mm experience acupuncturists student third train year post graduate TCM ( traditionel chinese medicine ) training course Medical University Vienna .

In sham acupuncture give acupuncture point prick 2-3 centimetre define point . The group patient receive acupuncture use PCA ( Patient Controlled Analgesia ) pain pump therapy choose control group . The pain pump therapy subject clinical study routinely use postoperative pain TKA operation need evaluation . 1.3 Randomising Patients agree take part study randomise blind surgeon 3 group regard plan pain therapy . For postoperative pain therapy patient receive , demand pain pump morphine control amount analgesic . The group form assumption 30 % reduction pain use acupuncture power analysis α=…… assume 3 group 30 people . : The method randomise occurs sequence . The blinding apply especially surgeon patient receive real sham acupuncture . 2 . Outcome measure : The primary aim find additive pain therapy form body ear/auricular acupuncture effectively prove pain reduction TKA implantation . The amount apply analgesic every postoperative day ( 1.-5 . ) defines command variable . The efficiency acupuncture measure accordingly reduction demand pain pump therapy . Secondary objective VAS every postoperative day ( 1.-5 . ) , assessment operate leg 's mobility well peri-operative nausea . The intensity pain record follow : A ) indirectly use protocol amount morphine administer PCA pump B ) measure pain VAS ( routinely 3 x daily )</detailed_description>
