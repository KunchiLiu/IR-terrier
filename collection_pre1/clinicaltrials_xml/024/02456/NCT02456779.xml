	<brief_summary>The primary objective clinical study determine whether Peptest ( Human Pepsin lateral flow vitro diagnostic medical device ) equivalent GERD diagnostic method commonly apply clinical practice test large number clinical sample . This perform evaluate Peptest result GERD patient ( Erosive esophagitis NERD ) , define use standard clinical procedure , compare healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Non-invasive In-vitro Diagnostic Test ( Peptest ) Against Other Diagnostic Methods GERD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) mainly manifest three type , erosive esophagitis ( EE ) , non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) Barrett 's esophagus . EE characterize damage distal esophageal mucosa visible endoscope , also refer `` endoscopically positive gastroesophageal reflux disease '' . NERD define discomfort relate reflux without obvious mucosal damage endoscope , also know `` endoscopically negative gastroesophageal reflux disease '' . At present diagnosis GERD use syndrome-based diagnosis , proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) test , 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring , endoscopy , etc . However , method lack specificity may bring great suffering patient due invasive ( e.g. , 24-hour esophagus pH monitoring ) . The disadvantage endoscopy lie low detection rate , 2.95 % 4.1 % NERD frequent diagnosis . Therefore , diagnosis base GERD syndrome still remain one common diagnostic method . In recent year , questionnaire survey GERD carry abroad , aim find simple feasible diagnostic method . As one world 's recognize commonly use diagnostic scale diagnosis GERD , reflux disease questionnaire ( RDQ ) survey medical history mainly base symptom score . Studies home abroad confirm validity reliability diagnosis GERD . The reflux symptom index ( RSI ) validate questionnaire use confirm presence ( absence ) extra-esophageal reflux atypical symptom reflux control subject may overlook . Peptest ( Human Pepsin lateral flow vitro diagnostic medical device ) use clinic fast convenient pepsin detection patient ' saliva . Pepsin , detect saliva sample , regard marker reflux event diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux disease . The primary objective study determine whether Peptest ( Human Pepsin lateral flow vitro diagnostic medical device ) produce RD Biomed Limited equivalent GERD diagnostic method commonly apply clinical practice test large number clinical sample . GERD patient control provide saliva sample test presence pepsin use Peptest . Peptest result ( positive negative ) evaluate GERD patient ( Erosive esophagitis NERD ) define use standard clinical diagnostic tool compare control ( confirm reflux use two validated questionnaire ) .</detailed_description>
