	<brief_title>Hyperfractionated Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) Versus Conventional Fraction IMRT Patients With Loco-regionally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local recurrence one challenging issue face nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) patient . 8.4 % 10.9 % patient develop recurrent disease primary or/and regional site definitive radiotherapy . Although patient limited recurrent lesion underwent surgery , main treatment recurrent NPC patient still re-irradiation . Multiple retrospective prospective study report : condition conventional fraction IMRT total dose 60 gray ( Gy ) ( division 27 time , day , every 2.2Gy ) , get good local tumor control rate survival outcome . However , patient still underwent severe late complication include nasopharyngeal necrosis , nasopharyngeal bleeding , temporal lobe necrosis , incidence rate 28.8 % , 18.6 % , 20.3 % , respectively . Approximately 50 % recurrent NPC patient die severe late complication , significantly compromise overall survival rate patient . Previous study show hyperfractionated radiotherapy could reduce severe late complication rate significantly , without affect local control rate . Indeed , find condition equal irradiation time tumor equivalent dosage hyperfractionated IMRT ( total dose 65Gy , division 54 time , twice day , 1.2Gy , irradiation interval 6-8 hour ) conventional fraction IMRT ( total dose 60Gy , division 27 time , day , every 2.2Gy ) , normal late respond tissue equivalent dosage ( EQD2 ) significantly decrease compare conventional fraction IMRT . Therefore , use hyperfractionated IMRT expect decrease severe late complication rate , thereby improve quality life overall survival patient .</detailed_description>
