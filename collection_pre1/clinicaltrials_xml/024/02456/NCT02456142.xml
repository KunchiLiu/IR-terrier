	<brief_summary>Pain subjective sensation child experience time express . Pain management child thus fall short adult counterpart . Acute pain surgery cause significant suffer stress . In child , pain management lag behind belief child 's pain receptor less well developed adult counterpart . However proven false development pain receptor show 26th week gestation . Caudal analgesia plain bupivacaine use effective post operative analgesia . Resources sometimes limit acquisition additive bupivacaine deliver intrathecal space . The fear pharmacological adverse effect opioids restrict use especially among anesthesia officer deliver bulk anesthesia service Uganda lead poor pain management pediatric population Mulago national referral hospital resource limit centre regard human resource , equipment drug . This mainly due lack sufficient fund large volume patient nursing staff overwhelm patient capacity . Drug administration often do time continuous assessment pain score child adequate result poor post operative pain management . Pain control thus depend analgesia provide time operation create need prolong pain control measure . Studies do compare intravenous morphine administration versus caudal analgesia mostly focus sub umbilical surgery however none do setting . Bupivacaine morphine readily available use post operative analgesia . However study time next analgesic requirement compared/done Mulago national referral hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients wheel operate theatre . - Anaesthesia induce use inhalation anaesthetic ( sevoflurane ) intravenous anaesthetic use propofol thiopental old child ( 3 year ) . - Maintenance anaesthesia do use either inhalation anaesthetic ( sevoflurane ) - Intra-operative analgesia maintain intravenous fentanyl give start surgery hourly surgery longer one hour . - Monitoring intra post operatively do WHO standard monitoring . ( Blood pressure , heart rate , saturation , temperature , ECG , End tidal carbon dioxide ) . - The intervention give end surgery last stitch place patient receive either caudal bupivacaine intravenous morphine . - receive caudal baby place left lateral position knee hips flex - The skin coccyx sacrum cleanse povidone-iodine solution alcohol . - After palpation sacral cornu , 22- 23-gauge needle place sacral hiatus identify epidural space loss resistance needle pass sacral ligament . - Aspiration do check cerebrospinal fluid blood , test dose administer rule intravenous injection drug caudal bupivacaine inject . - The patient ' pain score assess research assistant post anaesthesia care unit 30 minute discharge parent ward hourly intervention give . - monitoring pulse rate saturation ward do pulse oximeter . - On ward pain score assess every hour research assistant time pain score 4 record - The pain score time next analgesic requirement record continuation analgesia give intravenous paracetamol . The cry , require oxygen , increase vital sign , expression , sleeplessness ( CRIES ) pain tool use score pain neonate Face , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) pain score use child 2 month . Analgesic requirement give child find pain .</detailed_description>
