	<detailed_description>HemoSonics develop novel POC diagnostic device , Quantra System , perform whole blood coagulation analysis suitable use surgical intensive care setting . The Quantra System employ patented technology name sonorheometry , invent University Virginia . Sonorheometry use ultrasound pulse characterize dynamic change viscoelastic property blood sample coagulation clot lysis . The initial assay perform Quantra System surgical assay monitor hemostasis major surgical procedure adult patient . A clinical study conduct evaluate analytical performance well provide preliminary evaluation performance comparability HemoSonics ' device compare exist coagulation monitoring technology heart surgery . This study perform HemoSonics University Virginia Health System involve patient undergo cardiac surgery require bypass .</detailed_description>
