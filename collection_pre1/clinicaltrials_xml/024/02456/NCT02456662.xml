	<detailed_description>Scheduled Prophylactic Anti-emetics Reduction Emesis Doxycycline ( SPARED ) Trial - Study Protocol Principal Investigator : Sarah Betstadt , MD MPH Department Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology University Rochester Medical Center 601 Elmwood Avenue Rochester , NY 14642-8668 Phone : ( 585 ) 276-5367 Co-Investigators : Amy Harrington , MD Whitney Hanan , MD 1 . PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND 1.1 Purpose study The goal study determine administer anti-nausea medication ondansetron prior doxycycline decrease rate nausea vomit patient take doxycycline antibiotic prophylaxis prior undergoing surgical pregnancy termination . 1.2 Background The use prophylactic antibiotic standard care prevent surgical site infection gynecologic surgery 1 . Doxycycline recommend antibiotic choice surgical pregnancy termination completion spontaneous abortion give effectiveness , low cost , rare occurrence allergic reaction 2 . Previous study show common side effect doxycycline nausea vomiting , report rate high 30-40 % 3 . Nausea vomiting may reduce take antibiotic food 4 . Doxycycline give empty stomach morning surgical pregnancy termination result nausea vomit 50 % patient rate decrease 15 % take food night surgery 5 . It know whether use schedule prophylactic anti-emetics prior doxycycline use would reduce rate associate nausea vomit . The goal investigator ' propose study determine . The investigator ' study double blind randomize controlled trial examine whether use schedule prophylactic anti-emetics prior doxycycline use reduces incidence associate nausea vomit . Nausea vomit distress patient affect perioperative care . It well document minor gynecologic procedure , uterine evacuation , perform safely moderate deep sedation without endotracheal tube 6 . At investigator ' institution , patient experience nausea vomit prior surgical procedure receive general anesthesia endotracheal intubation , due symptom , would prefer route anesthesia . For minor gynecologic procedure , time general anesthesia induction long duration entire surgical procedure would without general anesthesia . The use general anesthesia increase duration time operate room , increase cost operate room anesthesia time , well recovery time patient 7 . General anesthesia also pose possible risk impairment cardiovascular function development pneumonia 8,9 . In addition anesthesia risk patient discomfort , nausea vomit many also affect antibiotic efficacy due reduce serum level . Reeves ' et al . show low serum doxycycline level patient emesis within one hour doxycycline administration . A serum level great 0.8 mg/L show provide adequate antibiotic prophylaxis . Vomiting ingestion doxycycline decrease serum level average 0.26 mg/L5 . Reducing rate nausea vomit patient undergo minor gynecologic procedure may increase efficacy antibiotic prophylaxis , decrease rate general anesthesia , patient risk hospital cost . Most importantly , decrease nausea vomit certainly improve patient experience clinically relevant doxycycline antibiotic commonly use many gynecologic procedure . 2 . STUDY DESIGN 2.1 Overview This randomize controlled trial . Data collect ask patient fill demographic questionnaire baseline visual analog scale rating nausea , pain anxiety clinic appointment 1-2 day prior procedure . Patients take either ondansetron placebo 30 minute prior take doxycycline night procedure . They fill symptom/medication log record symptoms time take study medication time present procedure . When present procedure , patient fill second identical visual analog scale rating nausea , pain anxiety . The primary outcome nausea vomit take study drug doxycycline night prior surgery . Doxycycline prophylaxis night prior surgery current standard care . Eligible patient enrol course two year . 2.2 Rationale Study Design A randomize control trial select order study ondansetron 's effect rate nausea vomit investigator ' particular population , patient 's know give ondansetron placebo take doxycycline . Some potential barrier expect study include patient may fill symptom/medication log do home . There approximately 450 patient undergoing surgical termination pregnancy University Rochester year .
