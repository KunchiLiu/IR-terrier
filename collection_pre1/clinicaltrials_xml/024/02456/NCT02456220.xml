	<brief_summary>The aim study perform three-dimensional ( 3D ) evaluation dentoskeletal change pubertal Class II malocclusion subject treat Herbst appliance ( HAG ) , comparison Class II comparison group ( CG ) . 3D virtual model generate three time-point CBCTs ( T0 , baseline ; T1 , immediately Herbst insertion ; T2 , 8 month ) 25 HAG patient evaluate . Virtual model obtain 25 Class II malocclusion patient , stage biologic maturation skeletal abnormality , orthopedic treatment construct CG subject . These CG patient orthodontic treatment , teeth alignment . Voxel base registration anterior cranial fossa use assess maxillary mandibular displacement/articular fossa remodel ; regional registration mandibular corpus perform evaluate mandibular growth mandibular dental change ; regional registration anterior region maxilla perform evaluate maxillary growth maxillary dental change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dentoskeletal Changes Associated With Herbst Appliance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND Class II malocclusion highly prevalent worldwide , major reason orthodontic treatment initiate . This type malocclusion restrict dentoalveolar region , majority Class II patient exhibit strong skeletal component malocclusion , include frequently mandibular skeletal retrusion increase low anterior facial height . With increased severity mandibular deficiency , orthodontist challenge treat underlie skeletal problem appropriately . For grow patient , use fix removable mandibular advancement appliance advocate many decade . A variety fix Herbst appliance design achieve worldwide acceptance eliminate major patient compliance factor . Today Herbst appliance ( HA ) far frequently use mandibular jump device United States , Herbst appliance fabricate function appliance combine . The Herbst appliance originally introduce Emil Herbst early year twentieth century , achieve worldwide clinical acceptance re-introduction Hans Pancherz 70 year later . Since , significant number clinical scientific study conduct HA , particularly Pancherz colleague . Two-dimensional cephalometric study report increase length mandible forward displacement mandible follow HA comparison match untreated control . On average , 2 mm mandibular length gain ( measure Gonion Pogonion ) 1.5 degree improvement SNB angle observe follow Herbst appliance therapy . Investigations experimental animal provide histological evidence change condyle , ramus , articular fossa mandible advanced laboratory set . Previous report show increased proliferation condylar cartilage monkey mandible advanced Herbst appliance . These adaptation occur primarily posterior posterosuperior region condyle . They also report significant bone deposition along posterior border mandibular ramus early part experimental period well significant deposition new bone anterior surface postglenoid spine articular fossa . It note , however , post-glenoid spine well-defined human . Clinical investigation use Magnetic Ressonance Imaging ( MRI ) lateral radiograph show change mandibular condyle articular fossa may occur Herbst therapy . It demonstrate follow Herbst therapy articular fossa remodel see anterior surface postglenoid spine , cause relocation articular fossa downward forward direction . But fossa adaptation Herbst patient less extensive experimental animal , much individual variation response evident . Although Herbst study convergent extent skeletal dentoalveolar adaptation , question still remain : - How much mandibular growth achieve therapeutic mandibular advancement ? - How much mandibular rotation skeletal bite opening occur ? - How much original mandibular advancement maintain long-term ? - Is adaptive behavior articular fossa mandibular advancement , bone remodel occur fossa . In last decade , new methodology use 3D virtual modeling develop allow change paradigm assess skeletal change associate growth treatment ; technology open new horizon scientific investigation dentofacial orthopedics . Recently , American Journal Orthodontists Dentofacial Orthopedics publish first 3D report Herbst treatment , pilot study 7 Class II subject treat Herbst appliance compare 7 Class II subject treat fixed appliance intermaxillary elastic . It report Class II patient undergo Herbst treatment demonstrate anterior displacement condyle articular fossa along maxillary restraint compare Class II patient use comparison . The aim present prospective control clinical trial investigate skeletal change mandible articular fossa Class II patient undergo Herbst appliance therapy , use 3D virtual model comparison control group comprise Class II subject . 2 . PATIENTS AND METHODS b.1 ) Study design This non-randomised controlled clinical trial , intervention . Two group plan : 1 ) Class II malocclusion subject treat Herbst appliance ( HAG ) ; 2 ) Class II malocclusion subject treat teeth alignment . The two group match stage skeletal maturation , type malocclusion , chronological age , gender . There blind outcome evaluator . Due ethical concern , comparison group compose Class II subject need previous alignment level teeth orthopedic phase treatment . b.2 ) Participants - setting location data collect The treatment perform Orthodontic Clinic Pontifical Catholic University Minas Gerais ( Belo Horizonte , Brazil ) . This private university , patient mostly low-income subject . Data collect August 2013 finish September 2015. b3 ) Sample size Based standard deviation 1.85 mm report Pancherz et al.28 , alpha significance level 0.05 power 0.80 detect change 1.5 mm , preliminary sample size 25 patient per group calculate . Therefore , 25 individual receive Herbst appliance begin treatment one-step full activation - Herbst Appliance Group ( HAG ) ; 25 skeletal Class II malocclusion individual , indication HA therapy , clinical condition require prior treatment HA insertion , allocate CG . The two group match chronological age ( 12 year 16 years-old ) , stage skeletal maturation stage dental development ( permanent dentition ) . b4 ) Appliance design The Herbst appliance design include bilateral telescoping arm ( 3M Abzil , São José Rio Preto , Brazil ) articulate pivot position maxillary mandibular arch . The pivot weld rigid cantilever wire ( .040-in stainless steel ) extend low first permanent molar band ( TP Orthodontics , La Porte , IN ) canine region mandible . In maxillary arch , pivot weld band permanent first molar . A Hyrax expander ( Morelli Ortodontia , Sorocaba , Brazil ) .040-in stainless steel ( SS ) low lingual arch add HA structure improve appliance stability transverse dimensional control . Two .028-in SS wire use occlusal rest permanent second molar avoid extrusion activation . The occlusal rest remove interfered occlusion avoid bite opening . b5 ) Method registration Cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) , intra-oral picture , extra-oral picture collect three time-points HAG ( T0 , T1 , T2 ) , two time-point CG ( T0 , T2 ) , regular protocol orthodontic record clinical treatment . b6 ) Method measurement Analysis serial CBCT image evaluate change T0 , T1 , T2 include 3D analysis methodology use ITK-SNAP ( open-source software , www.itksnap.org ) ; SLICER ( open-source software , www.slicer.org ; VAM - Vectra Analysis Model software version 3.7.6 ( Canfield Scientific Inc. , Fairfield , NJ ) . The tridimensional image analysis procedure include : ( 1 ) approximation scan ; ( 2 ) construction 3D label model ; ( 3 ) voxel base image registration ; ( 4 ) quantitative qualitative assessment use 3D mesh surface model . Quantitative assessment positional change 3D surface model cranial base , maxilla , mandible perform use point-to-point landmark measurement ( VAM software ) , virtual analytics ( SLICER software ) . Interactive visual analytics include graphic display qualitative assessment use semitransparent overlay 3D surface model different time-points quantitative assessment surface displacement use color-coded surface distance map . All visual analytics assessment perform use two module ( Model-to-Model Distance Shape Population Viewer ) SLICER software . Voxel base registration anterior cranial fossa use assess maxillary mandibular displacement/articular fossa remodel ; regional registration mandibular symphysis perform evaluate mandibular growth mandibular dental change ; regional registration anterior region maxilla perform evaluate maxillary growth maxillary dental change . b7 ) Method analysis For primary secondary outcome measure use Statistical Package Social Science ( SPSS ) software ( version 16.0 Chicago , IL ) . Descriptive statistic present group . Statistical difference two group calculate Mann-Whitney test ( comparison difference mean HAG CG ) . The comparison change within group perform use Wilcoxon 's test .</detailed_description>
