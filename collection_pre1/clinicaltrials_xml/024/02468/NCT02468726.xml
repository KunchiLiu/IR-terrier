	<brief_summary>In order flexible sigmoidoscopy successful screening procedure , bowel must free solid matter endoscopist clear view , increase chance detection abnormality . This achieve use bowel cleanse preparation , administer prior procedure . Enemas prefer method clear low bowel quickly oral formulation require dietary restriction . The medical device test clinical investigation NER1008 , enema contains PEG3350 ( polyethylene glycol 3350 ) . PEG3350 osmotic agent , hold water content rectum sigmoid colon , consequently increase stool volume , result rectal distension subsequent distal colon empty . The increased colonic luminal content stimulate motility , propulsive transportation rectal evacuation distal colon content . This study design assess performance NER1008 bowel cleanse compare performance Fleet® enema , widely use purpose .</brief_summary>
