	<brief_summary>Introduction Maternal neonatal mortality continue prominent public health issue sub Saharan Africa include Ghana , slow progress make towards attainment Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) 4 &amp; 5 . Studies identify poor quality maternal child healthcare major challenge prevention neonatal maternal death . Effective intervention require make significant inroad area . Objective To evaluate effect SMS text message intervention support clinical decision make frontline health care professional neonatal maternal mortality . Methods We propose conduct randomize controlled trial Eastern region Ghana , involve 8 intervention 8 control district . The intervention consist text message standard protocol maternal neonatal care front line health care provider region . A total 17,040 pregnant woman receive care ( include antenatal , delivery post-natal ) hospital select district region monitor monthly aggregate data outcome measure neonatal maternal death eclampsia , postpartum haemorrhage , puerperal sepsis , birth asphyxia , low birth weight neonatal sepsis . Cord sepsis also include neonatal sepsis study . Also , quality care assessment four sample district measure adherence safe motherhood protocol conduct . Stata software package.55 MLwiN software version 2.2456 employ data analysis . Descriptive analysis carry explore baseline characteristic study group logistic regression apply evaluate effect intervention . A two-tailed statistical significant level 0.05 use . Expected outcome We hypothesize intervention improve maternal neonatal service delivery health outcome intervention area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale Study Based preponderance evidence provide far , Ghana track MDG 4 &amp; 5.31 Despite increase antenatal care attendance health facility , number pregnancy deliver skilled health care worker , neonatal maternal mortality see need decline . Maternal death neonatal death cause complex interaction economic , financial , social , cultural clinical factor . Clinical factor related access quality antenatal care , skilled attendance delivery emergency obstetric care . With 90 % pregnant woman receive antenatal care health professional , believe adequate care offer woman , birth outcome improve . Gaps identify quality care give pregnant woman include poor quality clinical decision guide provider decision management choice . Considering propose evidence-based intervention facilitate easy access maternal neonatal guideline routine emergency obstetric antenatal/neonatal care frontline provider , public facility . For purpose intervention , choose reference guideline national Safe Motherhood protocol , elaborate tool , provide detailed state-of-the-art guideline maternal newborn care , start prenatal care , antenatal , delivery , postpartum , newborn care . We choose text messaging base Unstructured Supplementary Service Data ( USSD ) system low-cost , easily-accessible instant way request need information standard emergency situation health care provider enhance clinical decision making . Objectives Primary objective - To assess quantitative effect USSD-based text message standard protocol maternal neonatal care incidence neonatal mortality Secondary objectives - To assess quantitative effect USSD-based text message standard protocol maternal neonatal care incidence maternal mortality - To assess quantitative effect USSD-based text message standard protocol maternal neonatal care incidence neonatal morbidity - To assess quantitative effect USSD-based text message standard protocol maternal neonatal care incidence maternal morbidity - To assess adherence health care provider clinical guideline maternal antenatal care Study design A cluster randomize control trial49 design use examine effect CDMSS form USSD-based text message standard protocol management maternal neonatal care provider , neonatal maternal mortality Eastern region , Ghana . This research plan commence January 2015 end June 2016 . Each district region cluster unit randomization . This design adopt order avoid contamination patient health professional level , may occur result social interaction . After randomization , baseline study conduct district facility collect data district facility characteristic , baseline measure choose outcomes obtain District Health Information Management System - 2 ( DHIMS - 2 ) show provide accurate estimate neonatal health indicators.50 This take place November December 2014 . The baseline study follow intervention study run period 18 month . During period monthly monitoring , include data collection outcome measure carry study team . In addition , quality care study , do assessment provider adherence guideline send SMS text messaging conduct 2 select district intervention control district , record review random sample client see period . The process implementation intervention document . At end intervention period , post intervention evaluation carry district facility level .</detailed_description>
