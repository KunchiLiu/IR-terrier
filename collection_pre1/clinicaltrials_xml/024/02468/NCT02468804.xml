	<brief_title>Cognitive Dysfunction In Parkinson 's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative illness ( Alzheimer 's disease ) affect 1-2 % people age 65.3 Although PD traditionally characterize motor symptom ( e.g . tremor , stiffness , slowness ) , research demonstrate cognitive dysfunction great impact patient suffer caregiver burden despite under-recognized . Cognitive dysfunction significant risk factor psychosis , dementia , nursing home placement affect 20- 40 % PD patient even time initial diagnosis.4,5 In patient PD survive 20 year longer , cognitive dysfunction lead cause nursing home placement three fourth PD patient ultimately develop dementia.6 We know neuron brain communicate fire certain frequency . A grow literature show high frequency ( 30-50 Hz ) brain activity call gamma activity particularly important communication distant brain area critical normal cognition.7 Prior study also show gamma activity reduce PD.8 However , know gamma activity reduce PD relationship change gamma activity cognitive dysfunction . We hypothesize reduction gamma activity key mechanism underlie cognitive dysfunction PD intervention increase gamma activity improve cognition . To test hypothesis propose use novel combination research method include magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . MEG measure magnetic activity scalp determine brain activity . We use MEG determine whether reduction gamma activity relate cognitive dysfunction PD . TMS use magnetic coil place scalp stimulate brain activity . While evidence repetitive TMS ( transcranial magnetic stimulation ) increase gamma activity may improve cognition , study purpose PD . We apply repetitive TMS PD patient determine whether gamma activity and/or cognitive function may improve non-invasively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We recruit 60 PD patient University Colorado Hospital ( UCH ) Movement Disorders Clinic diagnose probable PD use United Kingdom ( UK ) Brain Bank Criteria . PD patient mild moderate severity base Hohn Yahr scale ( score 3 less medication state ) stable dose PD medication . Clinical severity also assess use Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale . We anticipate recruitment difficult UCH Movement clinic see 800 PD patient annually , majority stage 3 less . Controls approximately match age gender group recruit clinic ( spouse ) advertisement community . Subjects exclude significant depression ( Beck Depression Inventory33 &gt; 14 ) Dementia ( Mini Mental State Examination34 &lt; 26 Frontal Assessment Battery35 &lt; 14 ) Other neurological psychiatric illness Significant history head injury , significant systemic medical disease ( e.g . liver failure , kidney failure , poorly control diabetes ) Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Cognitive enhance medication ( e.g . stimulant acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ) contraindication either TMS MRI ( pregnancy , pacemaker , unstable cardiac disease , skull lesion , claustrophobia , history epilepsy medication know low seizure threshold ) .</criteria>
