	<brief_summary>The purpose extension study : 1 ) evaluate durability effect skeletal muscle mass , strength physical function upon discontinuation treatment receive core study 2 ) evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics efficacy additional 24 week bimagrumab treatment old patient sarcopenia previously receive 24 week treatment core study . The parallel group , placebo-controlled randomize withdrawal design allow unbiased comparison duration effect upon withdrawal 3 different dose regimen bimagrumab placebo change muscle quantity patient physical function population old adult sarcopenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Withdrawal Extension Study Bimagrumab 70 , 210 , 700 mg Older Adults With Sarcopenia Previously Participating Core Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective ass durability effect bimagrumab ( BYM ) compare withdrawal BYM ( i.e. , BYM/placebo PBO switch ) treatment continue BYM administration every 4 week 24 additional week treatment ( follow participation core study ) old adult sarcopenia measure change week 25 week 49 6MWT . The secondary objective : - To evaluate effect BYM give intravenously every 4 week 24 additional week treatment ( follow completion 24 week treatment core study ) safety tolerability assess measure vital sign , clinical laboratory variable , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , adverse event compare treatment PBO old adult sarcopenia . - To evaluate durability effect BYM comparing withdrawal BYM ( i.e . BYM/PBO switch ) treatment continue BYM administration every 4 week 24 additional week treatment ( follow completion 24 week treatment core study ) old adult sarcopenia measure change week 25 week 49 : - performance Short Physical Performance Battery score mobility measure gait speed ( GS measure component SPPB ) 4 meter - total lean body mass appendicular skeletal muscle index measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry</detailed_description>
