	<brief_title>Effect Vitamin E Skin Aerobic Bacteria Palmar Arsenical Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arsenicosis emerge one main hazardous public health problem Bangladesh . Melanosis keratosis common manifestation arsenicosis . The exact mechanism development keratosis clear . With chronic ingestion arsenic contaminate water excretion arsenic skin increase also oxidative stress , turn cause cellular damage . These change may influence growth normal bacteria consistency skin , may responsible keratosis . In different study result show , vitamin E , potential antioxidant halt lipid peroxidation maintains cell membrane integrity , also detoxify arsenic body . Normal skin bacteria mainly compose Gram +ve bacteria . In arsenicosis , pattern change Gram +ve bacteria Gram -ve bacteria . Still study conducted see , effect vitamin E skin bacteria arsenicosis , skin bacteria change . Therefore , study conduct observe change aerobic bacterial pattern skin arsenicosis administration vitamin E capsule . Fifteen patient skin manifestation , 15 arsenic expose control , 15 healthy volunteer recruit basis inclusion exclusion criterion . They provide vitamin E capsule 200 IU twice daily 12 week without interruption . Water nail sample collect confirm diagnosis . Skin sample collect two time ( give vitamin E ) qualitative analysis bacteria . All patient , arsenic expose control healthy subject provide capsule dosage schedule . So , study find change skin bacteria pattern administrate vitamin E capsule .</detailed_description>
