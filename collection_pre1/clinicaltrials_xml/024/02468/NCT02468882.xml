	<brief_title>Does Watercress Intake Have Impact Cancer Patients Outcomes : Longitudinal Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relation cancer nutrition well establish ; cancer build upon damage cellular DNA result carcinogenic environmental factor , nutrition play major role . Many diet lifestyle factor influence development cancer , disease expect affect worldwide 1 3 people . Population study associate high intake cruciferous vegetable reduce risk cancer several location . In 1977 , study laboratory animal show potential effect phenylethyl isothiocyanate ( PEITC ) inhibit carcinogenesis . Recent study identify several active isothiocyanate watercress extract may significant anticarcinogenic activity PEITC alone . Potential anticarcinogenic mechanism include : prevent carcinogen activation inhibit phase I enzymes cytochrome P450s , increase cell ' resistance detoxification/antioxidant enzymes ; e.g . phase II enzymes ( quinone reductase , glutathione S-transferases , UDP glucuronosyltransferases ) ; , inhibit cell cycle progression and/or induce apoptosis . Several watercress component antigenotoxic effect vitro result reduce DNA damage anti-proliferative effect . These component include flavonols quercetin , hydroxycinnamic acid ferulic acid p-coumaric acid . In HT29 colon cancer cell , extract watercress juice associate inhibition three stage carcinogenesis : initiation , proliferation metastasis . In MDA-MB-23 human breast cancer cell , watercress extract inhibit metalloproteinase-9 activity , thus suppress invasive potential cancer cell . In breast cancer , epidemiological study suggest cruciferous vegetable may reduce cancer incidence . In animal study , 9-week PEITC-NAC supplement diet vs non-supplemented diet significantly associate reduction tumour size weight . A recognised mechanism PEITC inhibit growth survival establish cancer cell inhibition angiogenesis . A study explore impact PEITC specific pathway central angiogenesis expose human MCF7 breast cancer cell PEITC measure hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) signal activity . PEITC show effective inhibitor HIF activity may contribute anti-angiogenic anti-cancer property . A follow experiment demonstrate , similar PEITC , crude watercress extract inhibit cancer cell growth HIF activity vitro . Furthermore 6 8 hour significant amount dietary intake watercress four healthy participant , peripheral blood cell demonstrate significantly reduce HIF signal activity , suggest dietary intake watercress may sufficient modulate potential anti-cancer pathway . Of relevance , blind , randomize crossover study carry 60 healthy volunteer instruct consume one pack ( 85g ) raw watercress daily 8 week . Compared control phase , watercress supplementation increase lymphocyte ' DNA resistance free radical , thus reduce DNA damage . The hypothesis set watercress may reduce cancer risk via decreased damage DNA possible effect antioxidant status increase level plasma carotenoid . These finding justifiably interest primary care set cancer primary prevention . Yet , cellular effect watercress supplementation may prove useful modulation cancer progression disease recurrence , yet explore area . Of note , role nutrition intervention medium long term outcome cancer demonstrate . It today acknowledge grade A evidence individualize nutritional counseling education play central role improve long-term outcome cancer , prolong survival , reduce late RT toxicity improve QoL . The present clinical trial nutritional supplementation cancer , intend explore effect therapeutic diet supplement nutraceuticals via watercress may prove useful DNA damage modulation , well global disease prognosis .</detailed_description>
