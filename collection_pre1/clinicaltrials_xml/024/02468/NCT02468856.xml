	<brief_summary>Sleep deprivation slow reaction time , reduces vigilance impairs judgment information processing . Chronic effect include metabolic dysfunction , cardiovascular disease cancer . Sleep deprivation affect quality life cause error judgment , whether occur behind wheel automobile hospital . Armodafinil , non-amphetamine wakefulness promote medication , indicate excessive sleepiness associate obstructive sleep apnea , narcolepsy , shift work sleep disorder use mitigate effect sleep deprivation . This study characterize effect armodafinil drive simulator performance . The effect armodafinil compare placebo study double blind crossover trial involve 10 healthy subject serial assessment baseline extensive sleep deprivation . Using simultaneous electroencephalogram ( EEG ) record simulated drive neurocognitive assessment vigilance , relationship brain activity cognitive performance establish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On first study day , subject come Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) early morning . In first 90 minute ( acclimation session ) study day EEG electrodes apply EEG signal measure continuously throughout session . Subjects instructed control operation drive simulator perform 10 minute test drive familiarize . Afterwards perform psychomotor vigilance task ( PVT ) , go/no-go association task ( GNAT ) , flanker inhibitory control attention task ( FLANKER ) Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) get familiar cognitive test . Each cognitive test last approximately 10 minute . The collect data acclimation session wo n't part analysis . The purpose session subject adapt measure . Following acclimation session , rest baseline subject measure consist simultaneous assessment cognitive performance brain activity . The subject first drive 60 minute drive simulator establish rest baseline drive performance . Afterwards rest baseline PVT , GNAT , FLANKER , IGT establish measure attention , vigilance , risk-taking decision-making . EEG record concurrently drive cognitive test . No blood sample take assessment rest baseline . Subjects discharge CRC completion baseline session ( approximately 2 hour ) even . During time subject allow sleep informed consume caffeine containing product ( e.g . Red Bull , coffee ) . To make sure subject n't go sleep time , sleep-wake activity monitor via actigraph . Upon return CRC , subject sleep deprived supervise least one study coordinator least one additional person make sure subject n't fall asleep night . The following day , 24 hour rest baseline session , fatigue baseline session start . Sessions rest baseline fatigue baseline schedule time day two consecutive day account circadian alignment . The testing procedure identical rest baseline session mean subject drive 60 minute drive simulator perform cognitive test baseline session . After completion fatigue baseline session , study drug ( armodafinil 250 mg placebo ) administer . To determine pharmacokinetics , blood sample obtain prior drug dose 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7.5 10 hour post-dose intravenous catheter place arm vein subject . After study drug intake subject perform 3 session drive simulator consist 60-minute drive 1 session consist 90-minute drive . The battery test perform baseline perform drive . Our study utilize PVT , GNAT , FLANKER , IGT addition EEG measure assess reaction time , decision-making , risk-taking ability focus specific task . These cognitive ability play important role drive investigator investigate extent sleep deprivation alters ability armodafinil able counter deteriorate effect sleep deprivation capability .</detailed_description>
