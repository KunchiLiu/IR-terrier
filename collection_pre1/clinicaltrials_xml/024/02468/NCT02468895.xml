	<brief_summary>Adult patient suspect confirmed idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( IIM ) recruit . Patients approach , consent , baseline demographic , diagnostics disease activity measure record , blood take . The collection data biological material mirror usual clinical practice far possible . Subjects ideally attend visit 3 , 6 12 month blood take , outcome measure record questionnaire complete . In addition , blood , muscle biopsy image undertaken part usual care also collect research purpose measure number biomarkers assessment diagnostic accuracy clinical utility evaluation . As per usual practice , muscle biopsy perform baseline , biopsy offer 6 month assess treatment response . A magnetic resonance ( MR ) muscle protocol also perform per usual clinical practice , gadolinium-enhanced MR heart scan offer . Both scan repeat 6 month . An exist electronic database entry system use data entry capture anonymised basis . The study thus base around diagnostic evaluation outcome measure improve quality care IIM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MYOPROSP - Prospective Cohort Study Myositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bioresource protocol , ethic application future funding comprise follow : ) UKMYONET cross-sectional study ii ) MYOPROSP inception cohort study iii ) MYOACT novel therapy registry iv ) UK neuromuscular biobank Primary endpoint The primary study endpoint sensitivity change biomarkers interest . Secondary endpoint This include limited : - Response treatment - Drug reduction cessation due treatment failure , adverse event clinical remission - Differentiation myositis subgroup use new image modality - Sensitivity biomarkers diagnose extramuscular manifestation ( include myocardial pulmonary lung disease ) predict severity clinical course - Identification novel genetic variant associate IIM subtypes - Cost economic analysis - Validations definition improvement criterion Cases adult &gt; 18 year , number different IIM clinical phenotype encounter clinically practice . It vitally important patient suspect , confirm , IIM also include natural history subsequent final diagnosis track . Subsequent investigation often confirm diagnosis confirm initial presentation . Patients confirm PM/DM IIM accord Bohan Peter criterion , remain internationally accept criterion inclusion clinical trial . Disease duration onset initial symptom would ideally less one year enrich cohort patient high disease activity minimal establish disease-related damage . Patients suspect `` possible '' polymyositis ( PM ) /dermatomyositis ( DM ) , diagnosis IIM suspect confirm probable/definite Bohan Peter criterion , also eligible . Patients myositis primary condition also fulfil criterion associate connective tissue disease , include limited , systemic sclerosis , Sjogren 's , SLE , rheumatoid arthritis , also allow inclusion study . Patients also eligible present ILD/Raynaud 's CTD feature association myositis specific antibody anti-synthetase obvious IIM-diagnostic feature . Patients IBM also accept study , meeting revise MRC Neuromuscular criterion . Patients also accept study posse amyopathic hypomyopathic DM , per Sontheimer criterion , state `` amyopathic DM subset DM characterize biopsy-confirmed hallmark cutaneous manifestation classic DM occur 6 month longer clinical evidence proximal muscle weakness serum muscle enzyme abnormality . If extensive muscle test carry , result within normal limit '' . STUDY METHODS : Initial approach Patients send letter consultant . The letter give brief introduction propose study patient information sheet include . A unique identifier would assign potential new recruit . Potential participant give full explanation study provide patient information sheet consent form sign , follow opportunity ask question . If allow sufficient time consider decision , want participate , informed consent sought . The sample anonymised , process , send The University Manchester storage analysis . No treatment withheld purpose study . Data collection ) UKMYONET cross-sectional study Baseline core data encompass clinical information outline UKMYONET collect . Blood serum plasma also collect . Retrospective data collection also allow interrogate baseline characteristic may influence outcome . ii ) MYOPROSP inception cohort study Baseline core data encompass clinical information outline UKMYONET collect , extend data medication use disease activity . As genetic material ( DNA ) change time , would necessary obtain one time-point ( 0 month ) ; however , epigenetic , psychological , clinical serological factor alter course treatment , therefore sequential sample take 3 , 6 12 month time point comparison . Whilst take part routine clinical practice , patient also consent part muscle biopsy , use research purpose , well follow-up biopsy . If tissue take part routine clinical practice , patient also consent use part research study . Patients may also approach clinical data collection yearly intervals 5 year inception . iii ) MYOACT novel therapy registry Baseline core data encompass clinical information outline UKMYONET collect , extend data medication use disease activity . Patients also give option partake MYOPROSP blood collection . iv ) UK neuromuscular biobank Blood/tissue relate underlying disease process collect take clinical purpose . Blood sample use extracted DNA , RNA , PBMC ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) , serum plasma sample also store use future study . Additionally , patient ask permission use anonymised clinical demographic detail future research project . Blood sample Patients consent take part study ask provide blood sample outline baseline , 3 month , 6 month 12 month . Normally , routine clinical practice ass patient time point . These blood test take addition routine test require assessment . Hence , although additional blood sample take , additional venepuncture require thus minimise inconvenience patient . In exceptional circumstance , may require blood sample take extra visit clinic/nurse time available routine sampling . Standard laboratory assay ELISA use measure serum enzyme , cytokine antibody level . Patient questionnaires Clinical data attain regard level disability ( Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire ) health outcome ( EQ-5D-5L ) . When patient attend review time point ( 3/6/12 month ) , ask complete questionnaire . If diagnosis DM , patient ask fill dermatology life quality index ( DLQI ) questionnaire , IBM , Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Related Scale ( IBM-FRS ) . The blood sample questionnaire already label unique identifier return Centre Musculoskeletal Research , The University Manchester , use pre-paid , pre-addressed blood box blood separate pre-paid stamp address envelope documentation . Core dataset The core dataset comprise UKMYONET basic dataset questionnaire blood serum plasma . Consent also allow data collection per MYOPROSP study patient regular follow . The International Myositis Assessment Clinical Studies ( IMACS ) Group agree core-set measure assess myositis disease activity , include assessment following : IMACS core measure disease activity 1 . Physician/patient global activity assessment visual analogue scale 2 . IMACS core measure disease activity 3 . Physical function 4 . Muscle enzymes 5 . Extraskeletal muscle disease 6 . Physical impairment measure Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Muscle tissue primary organ affected myositis , organ may also involve , hence requirement capture extraskeletal disease activity use Myositis Intention Treat Index ( MITAX ) Myositis Activity Assessment Visual Analogue Scales ( MYOACT ) . The Myositis Damage Index ( MDI ) assess extent severity damage . MITAX , MYOACT MDI physician-initiated questionnaire . Further optional information also collect performed part routine clinical assessment , eg information endurance . Clinical Data As well information Core dataset , data capture baseline include demographic , clinical disease classification , data detail confirmation diagnosis ( include muscle biopsy , electromyography , autoantibody status , MR finding ) co-morbidities therapy . Changes therapy captured subsequent visit along IMACS core measure . For IBM , additional monitoring perform include limited IBM functional relate scale , 6 minute walk test , time go , grip strength . MR image As sub-study , patient give option MR imaging femur image thigh musculature , gadolinium-enhanced MR image heart month 0 6 . It normal clinical practice perform MR femur baseline follow-up , would consider best practice MR image heart . In patient gadolinium contrast would deem high-risk ( renal impairment , history previous contrast reaction ) , would offer . A protocol develop conjunction musculoskeletal radiology colleague standardise method use MR image different participate centre . Muscle biopsy At diagnosis , muscle biopsy routinely perform local anaesthetic non-invasive fashion . Several sample usually take one pas , one sample store PAXgene tube RNA expression study . The remainder sample process analysed local clinical histopathological department . Muscle biopsy specimens snap-frozen isopentane use liquid nitrogen store -80C . Protocols muscle tissue mounting , section storage already test optimised part UK juvenile dermatomyositis research study use . A biopsy plan offer 6 month post-recruitment study . Although routine clinical practice , important clinical question need address clinical utility repeat biopsy whether may quantify change disease activity thus allow accurate decision-making treatment reduction/escalation .</detailed_description>
