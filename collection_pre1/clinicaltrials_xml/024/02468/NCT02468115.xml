	<brief_title>Influenza Challenge Study VIS410 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2a randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study conduct healthy volunteer . The study design compare infusion single dose VIS410 placebo . Eligible volunteer admit clinical center receive single intranasal administration influenza A ( H1N1 ) . One day ( 24h ) inoculation , subject receive single administration VIS410 placebo . Subjects confine clinical center 10 day virus administration . Assessment safety determine vital sign measurement , physical examination , hematology , chemistry urinalysis laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , pulmonary function , use concomitant medication , review adverse event ( AEs ) occur . During confinement clinical center symptom score card influenza symptom complete three time day ; nasopharyngeal swab obtain three time day assay presence influenza virus VIS410 concentration ; serum sample assay VIS410 presence cytokine . Upon release clinical center subject return follow-up visit day 14 , 28 either 56 84 .</detailed_description>
