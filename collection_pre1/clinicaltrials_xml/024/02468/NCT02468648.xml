	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis C serious liver disease . Current treatment side effect . New drug develop , work well people others . Researchers want learn . Objective : - To learn new hepatitis C drug sometimes work . Also , learn drug safe well work people different virus strain . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 older infect hepatitis C virus genotypes 1-4 either never treat treat previously interferon regimen ( without ribavirin ) fail clear virus . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test complete questionnaire . - Participants Fibroscan ultrasound measure liver stiffness liver scan . They electrocardiogram . - Eligible participant liver biopsy . - Participants admit Clinical Center . They physical exam blood test , complete questionnaire . - They take first study drug dose tablet take daily . - Participants take drug home 12 week . - Participants 6 study visit . They blood vital sign take , complete questionnaire . - At week 4 , participant another liver biopsy . - After last drug dose , participant 5 follow-up visit . They blood vital sign take , complete questionnaire . They discuss medication side effect . They may another Fibroscan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Viral Kinetics , Interferon Stimulated Genes ( ISGs ) mirRNA Among Subjects Infected With Different Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes During Therapy With Sofosbuvir GS-5816</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 140 patient chronic hepatitis C , genotypes 1-4 , never treat previously treat failed course therapy interferon ribavirin combination regimen eligible enrol pilot study evaluate combination sofosbuvir GS-5816 fix dose tablet improve response antiviral therapy . To enrich study population subject great likelihood virological relapse stop therapy , plan enroll minimum 60 % treatment-experienced subject 50 % cirrhosis . These two drug inhibit key enzyme necessary viral replication . Sofosbuvir , NS5B polymerase inhibitor already approve use combination interferon ribavirin treatment HCV genotype 1 infection . GS-5816 NS5A replication complex inhibitor potent activity strain hepatitis C virus . Combining two agent single pill improve patient compliance improve tolerability interferon ribavirin part regimen . After medical evaluation liver biopsy , patient receive combination therapy sofosbuvir GS-5816 one pill day 12 week . The baseline liver biopsy necessary ass amount liver damage cause HCV measure expression gene associate clearance HCV . Blood sample collect monitor safety response therapy research purpose . HCV RNA level monitor frequently initial 4 week monthly interval remain 8 week antiviral therapy . All subject undergo second liver biopsy , 4 week start therapy . The second biopsy perform research purpose investigator determine specifically liver gene associate failure therapy ( response therapy ) . Subjects refuse second liver biopsy continue receive SOF/GS-5816 treatment plan 12 week duration Patients serum HCV RNA great equal low limit quantification ( LLOQ ) 2 consecutive HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ confirm &gt; 1 log10 increase nadir discontinue therapy ( continue therapy consider futile i.e . unlikely work ) . The major endpoint change interferon stimulate gene protein expression liver change HCV RNA level liver serum baseline 4 week rate sustain virologic response post-treatment week 12 . Secondary endpoint safety sustain virologic response post-treatment week 24 week .</detailed_description>
