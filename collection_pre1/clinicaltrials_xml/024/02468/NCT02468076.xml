	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Biliary obstruction relevant factor survival quality life patient suffer primary bile duct malignancy pancreatic head carcinoma . Due insidious course , cancer often diagnose advanced stage . Thus , therapy frequently restrict palliative management . Within set , prevention/treatment biliary complication jaundice , cholangitis , sepsis one key therapeutic factor extend survival maintain quality life ( 1-3 ) . Endoscopic stenting biliary tract generally accept primary approach reestablish sufficient biliary drainage , provide approximately 50 % liver parenchyma drain ( 4 ) . As tumor grows , unfortunately , often occur jaundice reappears despite primary stenting . Most oftenly relate unbridled tumor expansion lead either stent-dysfunction tumor ingrowth ( mesh case metallic stenting via clog plastic stent ) either extension proximal bile ducts/branches shut sufficient/adequate biliary drainage . Given context incurable disease , minimally-invasive strategy could reduce tumor burden addition stenting might consider beneficial term longer sustain bile duct drainage , improve quality life , efficiently administer well tolerated course chemotherapy delayed disease progression . An example potential minimal invasive strategy RadioFrequency Ablation ( RFA ) . It involve modified electrocautery technique emerge among many choice local , minimally invasive tissue ablation . It proven effective , versatile , relatively inexpensive . RFA use year treatment cardiac dysrhythmias aberrant conduction pathway , osteoid osteoma , prostate hypertrophy , chronic pain ( 5-8 ) . Recent clinical application include tumor ablation liver ( 9-11 ) , kidney ( 12,13 ) adrenal gland ( 14,15 ) , bone ( 16 ) , lung ( 17 ) , breast ( 18 ) well soft tissue debulking pain palliation ( 19 ) . In context gastro-intestinal endoscopy , RFA take place reduction neoplastic progression Barrett esophagus 3 year follow-up ( 20 ) . With regard biliopancreatic endoscopy oncology particular , approach recently introduce . A primary experience use alternative endoscopically applicable RFA-system bile duct lesion , show feasible safe ex vivo resect fresh pig liver open-label pilot study involve 22 patient malignant biliary obstruction ( 21,22 ) . Similar result obtain animal test ELRA-system ( StarMed , Taewoong Medical , Seoul , Korea ) . The presumed theoretical advantage current system ( ELRA system , StarMed , Taewoong Medical , Seoul , Korea ) capacity well control locally apply temperature time maintain temperature continuous , prevent tissue adjacent active tip carbonization procedure . Additionally 4-ring appliance thermal ablation allow well thermal spread therefore appliance ablation STUDY OBJECTIVE &amp; DESIGN This project involve single center investigator-driven prospective non-randomized non-controlled trial evaluate feasibility , safety efficacy thermal ablation biliary obstructive malignancy mean ELRA RF ERCP primary intent obtain palliative biliary drainage via stenting . STUDY METHODOLOGY : POPULATION &amp; INTERVENTION ELIGIBLE PATIENT POPULATION All patient inoperable biliopancreatic tumor obstructive jaundice therefore need biliary drainage via ERCP , eligible consent inclusion ( cfr infra ) , consider entry study . This non-randomized non-controlled investigator-driven trial . ENDOSCOPIC INTERVENTION All procedure perform general anesthesia , accord standard good clinical practice . After perform endoscopic sphincterotomy with/without balloon dilatation stenosis ( conventional approach ) preparation stenting , RFA catheter ( ELRA , Taewoong , Seoul , Korea ) , suitable endoscopic delivery biliary tree 0.035-inch guide wire , advance level malignant stenosis . The `` end follow−up '' define end follow−up period ( designated 3 month index procedure ) failure treatment death . The outcome parameter compare historically match control group ( i.e . stented without RFA ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female subject age 18 year old 2 . A confirmed diagnosis ( endoscopic radiology , histology etc ) pancreatic cholangiocarcinoma obstructive jaundice consider inoperable accord multidisciplinary assessment 3 . Willing able give write informed consent 1 . Refusal consent undergo ERCP 2 . Less 50 % liver parenchyma potentially drainable preintervention image 3 . Platelets &lt; 40 x 109 mm3 , international normalize ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.5 4 . Other concomitant disease condition likely significantly decrease life expectancy ( e.g. , moderate severe congestive heart failure , severe COPD ) 5 .
