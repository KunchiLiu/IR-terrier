	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) effective surgical therapy select Dystonia patient refractory medication generalize symptom ( e.g . patient Early-Onset Primary Dystonia ( DYT1 ) mutation dystonia subtypes ) . DBS patient typically experience significant improvement disabling symptom ; however , detailed programming always require , stimulation-induced side effect commonly emerge . Clinicians may empirically vary voltage , pulse width , frequency also active contact DBS lead achieve observe optimal benefit . The majority DBS patient undergo repeat surgery replace implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) every 2.5 5 year . It demonstrate , dystonia patient , high setting require adequate symptomatic control , neurostimulators considerably short life compare neurostimulators patient essential tremor Parkinson 's disease . Additionally , several small study suggest alternative pulse stimulation property pulse shape modification low IPG battery consumption . Newer pattern stimulation ( regularity pulse shape pulse ) widely test clinical practice , part current FDA device label . Novel pattern stimulation however , potential improve symptom , reduce side effect , preserve neurostimulator life . The current research proposal prospectively study biphasic pulse stimulation paradigm effect dystonic symptom . The investigator aim demonstrate tailor DBS setting address dystonia symptom , improve safety profile , characterize distinct clinical advantage , carefully document safety neurostimulator battery consumption profile biphasic stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In research study , different stimulation pattern DBS device try effectiveness current symptom . There two different stimulation pattern perform occur different clinic date . Each stimulation pattern time vary 2-3 hour per stage . One part study deliver stimulation continuous manner , part study deliver stimulation base upon response obtain change brain wave pattern . These procedure perform clinic regular program visit different visit . The current DBS setting record end session set reset back previous setting . The participant option participate one part . During visit , participant analyze tremor slowness use Trigno wireless Electromyography ( EMG ) Kinesia system . The system include unit compose two module : wrist module , size I-Pod attach wrist comfortable wristband , sensor module , place index finger . The entire visit videotape UDRS ( Unified Dystonia Disease Rating Scale ) BFMDRS ( Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale ) score evaluate two scorer . Pre-DBS `` '' `` '' score also take .</detailed_description>
