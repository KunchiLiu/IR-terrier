	<brief_title>Transcriptomic Biochemical Changes During Migraine Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine common neurological disorder affect approx . 16 % European population . Despite fact migraine common disorder , pathogenesis still sufficiently know . Studying transcriptomic biochemical change spontaneous migraine-attacks greatly enhance understand migraine mechanism may point new target drug development . Two blood sample ( one RNA analysis one biochemical analysis ) take minimum 15 patient migraine aura 15 patient migraine without aura experience spontaneous migraine attack . A second sample take 2 hour treatment subcutaneous sumatriptan . Another two blood sample take patient migraine free least 5 day headache least 24 hour . A fourth set blood sample collect cold pressor test .</detailed_description>
