	<brief_title>Clinimetric Properties Outcome Measures Bronchiectasis UK</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis persistent progressive condition characterise dilated thick-walled bronchus . The recent guideline stipulate high resolution computerise tomography scan ( HRCT ) radiological investigation choice establish diagnosis bronchiectasis . The key radiological feature bronchiectasis include bronchial wall dilation ( internal lumen diameter great accompany pulmonary artery ) characteristic feature bronchiectasis . Prevalence bronchiectasis population largely inaccurate due lack recent study . United Kingdom ( UK ) figure indicate prevalence figure 100/100,000 base study undertaken 1950 's involve use high resolution computerise tomography scan diagnosis . This number five ten time high people 55 year age . The mean age death 72 year . The aetiology bronchiectasis variable , however , current data suggest common cause : post infectious ; immunological ; congenital ; proportion also idiopathic . Bronchiectasis increasingly recognise major cause pulmonary morbidity . The sign symptom bronchiectasis include chronic sputum production , shortness breath fatigue ; contribute increase morbidity may progress respiratory failure cor pulmonale . The management bronchiectasis incorporate intense regime prevention treatment . These often include daily intake inhaled nebulised medication , antibiotic therapy , airway clearance , visit GP and/or respiratory clinic hospitalisation . The burden treatment associate bronchiectasis therefore significant provide huge economic cost health service . Many treatment provide absence sound evidence base clear need develop assessment tool use clinical trial clinical practice . There increase demand researcher regulatory body use robust outcome measure clinical trial evidence validity , reliability , responsiveness . There currently little agreement core clinical endpoint use bronchiectasis . The importance improve endpoint outcome measurement well recognised group condition focus activity achieve consensus core set outcomes clinical trial . The Bronch-UK collaboration explore current evidence clinimetric property commonly use outcome measure bronchiectasis ( e.g . forced expiratory volume one second [ FEV1 ] , health relate quality life [ HRQoL ] , pulmonary exacerbation ) . The result extensive rigorous literature review 68 paper clearly demonstrate whilst good evidence validity key outcome measure bronchiectasis little information available reliability ( period clinical stability ) response treatment ( effect size ) . Spirometry method assess lung function measuring volume air patient able expel lung maximal inspiration . Spirometry method measure speed volume airflow see `` gold standard '' test lung function . Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) healthy individual early disease mostly reflect proximal airway , however , annual rate change FEV1 bronchiectasis small FEV1 responsive many treatment especially mild disease . In recent year measure lung function emerge potential outcome measure bronchiectasis . The pathological change bronchiectasis involve small airway . Forced expiratory flow 25 75 % ( FEF25-75 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) propose sensitive measure early airway dysfunction . The major barrier use FEF25-75 dependent patient effort , less reproducible FEV1 poorly define normal range different age group . Lung clearance index measure multiple breath washout ( MBW ) measure ventilation inhomogeneity consider reflect abnormality small airway . Small airway disease cause inflammation obstruction lead ventilation heterogeneity . This therefore cause increase number breath remove tracer gas due uneven gas mix subsequently increase lung clearance index . To date , majority study use lung clearance index conduct cystic fibrosis . These study show lung clearance index sensitive spirometry detect early lung pathology sensitive repeatable clinical endpoint . It use secondary end-point UK cystic fibrosis gene therapy multidose study ; Invacaftor study ; hypertonic saline study ; , DNase study . The investigator conduct preliminary study explore use lung clearance index bronchiectasis show lung clearance index repeatable short period time sensitive indicator compute tomography ( CT ) scan abnormality spirometry bronchiectasis . Further research need provide data long term repeatability period stability ( noise ) also establish responsiveness change ( effect size ) . Multiple questionnaire include St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) ; Quality Life - Bronchiectasis ( QOL-B ) Questionnaire; , EuroQol 5 Dimension ( EQ-5D ) use capture impact health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) /patient report symptoms bronchiectasis . There comparative data direct choice appropriate questionnaire use clinical trial . With respect individual questionnaire also need provide data long term repeatability reliability . Aims : The aim study explore clinimetric property range outcome measure , order make recommendation use clinical trial bronchiectasis . These measure include : lung function ( spirometry , lung clearance index ) ; health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) assessment [ St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) ; Quality Life - Bronchiectasis ( QOL-B ) Questionnaire; EuroQol 5 Dimension ( EQ-5D ) ] ; , blood ( white cell count , c-reactive protein ) sputum ( microbiology , inflammatory marker ) processing . Specific Objectives : - To ascertain relative stability ( least noise ) potential outcome measure bronchiectasis one year timeframe . - To ascertain relative effect size outcome measure pulmonary exacerbation signal interval ( great signal-to-noise ratio ) . - To compare clinimetric property ( reliability , validity responsiveness change ) health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) questionnaires .</detailed_description>
