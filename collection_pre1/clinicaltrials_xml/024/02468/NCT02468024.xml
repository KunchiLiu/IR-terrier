	<brief_title>JoLT-Ca Sublobar Resection ( SR ) Versus Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SAbR ) Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy show single institution phase II match cohort study effective control primary early lung cancer . Recent pool analysis STARS ROSEL randomize trial compare SABR versus lobectomy show significantly improve 3-year survival SABR , give impetus successful completion randomize trial . Pre-randomized trial- Patients screen pre-randomized either SR SAbR . Informed consent obtain patient make aware randomized assignment . Despite pre-randomization prior consent , patient maintain right accept decline any/all study activity . Only consent patient allow participate study activity , include observation either randomize treatment observation standard care treatment , decline consent manage physician ( ) study.Patients accrue follow minimum 2-years treatment .</detailed_description>

Those ground glass opacity &lt; 50 % solid component exclude . Biopsy confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer . Tumor ≤ 4 cm maximum diameter , include clinical stage IA select IB PET/CT scan chest upper abdomen perform within 60 day prior registration . All clinically suspicious mediastinal N1 , N2 , N3 lymph node ( &gt; 1 cm shortaxis dimension CT scan and/or positive PET scan ) confirm negative involvement NSCLC one follow method : mediastinoscopy , anterior mediastinotomy EUS/EBUS guide needle aspiration , CTguided , videoassisted thoracoscopic open lymph node biopsy . Tumor verify thoracic surgeon location permit sublobar resection . Tumor locate peripherally within lung . NOTE : Peripheral define touch surface within 2 cm proximal bronchial tree direction . See . Patients nonperipheral ( central ) tumor NOT eligible . No evidence distant metastasis . Availability pulmonary function test ( PFTs spirometry , DLCO , +/ arterial blood gas ) within 90 day prior registration . Patients tracheotomy , etc , physically unable perform PFTs ( therefore test Major criterion 3.1.10 ) potentially still eligible study credentialed thoracic surgeon document patient 's health characteristic would otherwise acceptable eligibility high risk nonetheless operable patient ( particular eligible sublobar resection ) .
