	<brief_summary>Research animal first experiment human indicate insulin action brain regulate peripheral insulin sensitivity . One major organ might liver . Previous study human show human brain insulin sensitive organ lean overweight/obese person . Therefore , study include lean versus overweight/obese person . In study , insulin action introduce intranasal insulin administration lean overweight human . As control , placebo spray administer . To mimick know spill small amount intranasal insulin circulation , small bolus insulin administer 15 minute follow placebo spray application . Peripheral insulin sensitivity assess hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp glucose uptake endogenous glucose production assess tracer dilution technique . Autonomous nervous system activity address heart rate variability . Involved brain area address fMRI nasal insulin application .</brief_summary>
