	<brief_title>Reduction Venous Emboli Load After Breathing Normobaric Oxygen Compared Air</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3.1 Overall study design flow chart This prospective , double blind , randomize control , cross-over study Sweden . The study perform three different set , contain identical standardized dive . The dive include movement depth . Dive-computers use . In pair dive 10-20 professional diver Swedish navy perform no-decompression dive . If multiple dive perform one day , appropriate adjustment dive depth time , accord establish Swedish navy standard . The gas use dive compress air . After surface diver breathe ( 15 L/min ) either normobaric oxygen normobaric air 15-30 minute , depend study set . Both oxygen air administer use free-flowing mask . The content gas container unknown diver examine personnel . Immediately post dive diver assess use TTD , TTE TCD determine VGE load , time VGE detection VGE duration . In Set 3 measurement do second dive . The subject avoid strenuous activity examination period dive Set 3 . Signs DCS actively seek . TTD measurement do every five min first 30 min , thereafter every 15 min 90 min . TTE perform every 30 min , use apical 4-chamber view . TCD measurement do continuously . Set 1 : 10-20 diver , divide two equal group ( A B ) . Dive 42 msw 10 min safety stop five msw three min . Five minute post dive breathing oxygen ( group A ) air ( group B ) 30 min . VGE load , time VGE detection VGE duration record . Blood sample draw pre dive two hour post dive . After least 48 hour , dive repeat switched gas group . Set 2 : 10-20 diver , divide two equal group ( A B ) . Dive 42 msw 10 min safety stop five msw three min . Five minute post dive breathing oxygen ( group A ) air ( group B ) 15 min . VGE load , time VGE detection VGE duration record . Blood sample draw pre dive two hour post dive . After least 48 hour , dive repeat switched gas group . Set 3 : 10-20 diver , divide two equal group ( A B ) . First dive 42 msw 10 min safety stop five msw three min . Five minute post dive breathing oxygen ( group A ) air ( group B ) 30 min . After surface interval 150 min Mikael - r√§tt dykintervall ... ? second dive 33 msw 12 min . VGE load , time VGE detection VGE duration second dive record . After least 48 hour , two dive repeat switched gas group . Blood sample draw first dive two hour second dive . AE include SAE record study . DCS may consider either AE SAE depend severity . Ongoing AE SAE follow . Any question concern arise relate study protocol direct principle investigator .</detailed_description>
