	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize obstruction fully reversible airway , severity disease prognosis determine solely change lung function . Pulmonary rehabilitation multidisciplinary program care patient chronic respiratory disease , individually design optimize physical social performance autonomy patient , promote improvement functional exercise capacity , quality life , reduce dyspnea , frequency duration hospitalization reduce frequency exacerbation disease . It still report survey improved ability perform activity daily life , exercise capacity , quality life , reduction respiratory symptom , anxiety depression patient chronic lung disease . The overall objective research evaluate effect pulmonary rehabilitation program exercise capacity , lung function , quality daily life reduction dyspnea patient COPD . A study type randomize , open-label trial follow recommendation CONSORT ( Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ) hold . The study conduct Clinical Department Physical Therapy School The calculation sample hold LEE program ( epidemiology laboratory statistic ) 95 % confidence interval allow loss 20 % sample go 58 patient . Inclusion criterion : Patients COPD eligible moderate COPD accord criterion gold GOLD ( Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ) well ex-smokers exacerbation disease last three month . Accompanied pulmonologist . Age 40-85 year . Be practice physical activity without cardiovascular orthopedic disease , make use bronchodilator oral theophylline , oxygen therapy corticosteroid . Exclusion criterion : Patients comorbidities musculoskeletal , peripheral saturation oxygen fall lower 90 % 6 minute walk test ( six ) minute . Difficulty cognitive understanding body awareness . The evaluation procedure : functional independence measure ( FIM ) ; london chest activity daily living ( LCADL ) ; scale medical research council ( MRC ) ; world health organization disability assessment schedule 2.0 ( WHODAS 2.0 ) ; anthropometric examination ; walk test six ( 6 ) minute ; step test ; As repetition maximum ( RM ) ; muscle activation - electromyography ; grip strength upper limb ( DMS ) ; ultrasound diaphragm dynamometer ; spirometry ; respiratory muscle strength ; saint george respiratory disease questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . The intervention perform session three time week 16 week ( 8 week assessment 8 week adaptation PR training ) . PR last 60 120 minute . Patients agree participate PR divide two group randomly envelop draw . Group A ( control ) receive treatment traditional pulmonary rehabilitation without resistive training upper limb ( UL ) group B receive treatment control additional upper limb resistance training . For data analysis continuous variable analyze central tendency dispersion measure , data dichotomous categorical variable analyze frequently measure . For realization inferential statistic . Since data normally distribute , Student test independent sample . The Mann-Whitney test use compare difference mean variable group . To analyze correlation functional capacity variable QOL use calculate Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) data normally distribute calculation Spearman correlation coefficient distribute normally . To evaluate reliability use coefficient intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences Windows ( version 17.0 ) .</detailed_description>
