	<brief_summary>Hemianopia refers compromise vision one half visual field , either one eye . Hemianopic Alexia ( HA ) read disorder relate impairment , usually cause stroke head injury . In order read , participant move eye along line text three four time per second . Such eye movement call saccade . One make use peripheral visual information right ( read left right , e.g. , English ) leave ( read right leave , e.g. , Arabic ) word . HA patient deprive much information . Patients HA require far saccade , slow read significantly often prevent read efficiently work pleasure . It follow read ability read left-to-right would compromise right-sided HA , read right-to-left left-sided HA . This study propose explore rehabilitation left-sided HA follow stroke , Arabic reader . An online treatment package develop English ( http : //www.readright.ucl.ac.uk/ ) . Currently , assessment treatment resource exist condition right-to-left reader . The aim develop novel Arabic reading test rehabilitation material . The current project propose 1 ) translate package Arabic , 2 ) develop new Arabic reading test material 3 ) collect data Arabic read stroke patient Phase 2 clinical trial . The hope develop effective , novel , empirically support read treatment package Arabic reader HA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>App-delivered Therapy Arabic Readers With Hemianopic Alexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Purpose Experimental Design Reading line text usually achieve plan series saccade , allow eye jump one word another ( read scan-path ) . Arabic reader use peripheral visual information leave word order plan read eye movement . Patients HA deprive information compensate create inefficient read scan-paths many additional saccade , result accurate slow reading . Some patient abandon read altogether , lose job read fast enough . Healthy subject read move ( scroll ) text faster static text . This type text , also call `` Times Square '' presentation , induces form involuntary eye movement call optokinetic nystagmus ( OKN ) reader , use part rehabilitation program , show improve subsequent reading performance static text . This study propose adapt technique scroll Arabic text , test Arabic-reading patient left-sided HA . Rehabilitation material make available Internet ( via iPhone and/or iPad Application ( 'app ' ) ) suitable subject , order investigate whether patient benefit use outside control trial condition . During pre- post-therapeutic intervention investigator record following : reading speed , visual field test score , visual search test score , eye-movements , Activities Daily Living score . Length time patient access rehabilitation material , also record . This study help determine efficacy Internet-based behavioural rehabilitation . It also provide information : 1 ) much improvement may gain program , 2 ) much practice patient likely require order improve reading significantly . Objectives This study propose : 1 . Adapt test reading rehabilitation technique patient left-sided HA , use scroll Arabic text ; 2 . Investigate whether patient benefit use material outside controlled trial condition . Hypothesis 1 . Patients report significant improvement speed read static text ( newspaper , book , letter , etc . ) function quality activity daily live . 2 . Patients decrease number fixation ( progressive regressive type saccade ) read static text . Methods Thirteen Arabic-reading patient left-sided homonymous HA follow stroke study period three month . A single-subject baseline control design employ . There treatment-free interval reading therapy . Baseline assessments visual field , eye movement performance text reading , text reading speed , visual search performance carry pre-intervention . Behavioural assessment repeat immediately follow every five hour therapy , follow-up . Patients determine long wait test point , differ read speed . Patients meet study criterion identify Dr. Alex Leff 's Alexia clinic National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery , University College London Hospital ( UCLH ) , well formal collaboration neuropsychology department Wellington Hospital . In addition , patient give option join study download read therapy app Apple iTunes store . An online consent form include registration . The aim recruit least thirteen patient study follow three year . Thirteen healthy age-matched Arabic reading control recruit variety source , include relative friends patient . Controls undergo assessment patient , assess . They undergo read therapy . Consent Initially , information sheet consent form deliver hard copy ( write Arabic English ) . When application develop , pilot study conduct . Participants complete online consent form , require click certain key box confirm read listen , understood , information . Risks , Burdens , Benefits : Benefits . App-delivered reading therapy never available rehabilitation package Arabic reading patient HA . The app may use stand-alone self-help reading therapy , part formal speech-language therapy . Additional benefit include real-time activity monitoring , track treatment progress , personalise feedback motivation support , portability flexibility use , potential improve practice . Risks/Burdens . This first study patient left-sided HA use scroll Arabic text . Thus little literature guide study . In order maximize potential , investigator adapt establish English-reading treatment approach use patient right-sided HA . There way predict many patient use application . Some participant may meet study criterion . In addition , patient manage use application . There therefore inherent risk access rehabilitation material require period time , enter data correctly . Data Collection Participants require enter follow data order gain full access rehabilitation material : Data collect App-based patient 1 . A unique login , create . ( This real name . ) This ensure time access application ; data collect name . 2 . Their email address ( optional ) , use forget login detail . 3 . The extent side hemianopia . If test perform doctor optometrist , section application provide self-testing . 4 . A test reading speed . This self-administered . Participants time ( timer application activate touch screen ) read standard text aloud . Their text read speed calculate feedback . Participants may check recheck various time study . 5 . A test performance visual search test . This self-administered . Participants test accuracy speed find object section application . Their performance score calculate feedback . Participants may check recheck various time study . 6 . Participants rate ability perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) measure functional status regard read impairment . Their score calculate feedback . Other optional field , may prove useful data analysis enough subject complete include : 1 . The cause hemianopia . ( This usually stroke head injury , free text option provide . ) 2 . How much reading manage hemianopia 3 . Whether hemianopia cause change loose employment Participants access app enter personal data . The data collect directly control participant amount time access rehabilitation material logon identification . The latter ensure participant log application multiple name . Rehabilitation material use app-based reading train The rehabilitation material consist simply chapter text , scroll left-to-right : , blind visual field participant normal visual field . The text source book copyright , freely available Internet . The aim provide stream text website , news , current affair etc . The participant may control speed text scroll . Participants advise practice read therapy day aim 20 40 minute per day . They also ask test reading speed every time complete five hour rehabilitation . Subjects prompt check reading speed every five hour exposure therapy . If choose record data , access rehabilitation material affect . Data collect Face-to-Face patient Patients HA adopt inefficient reading strategy compensate visual impairment hemianopic side . Therefore , want compare patient ' read scan-paths generate healthy control read static passage . We record eye movement participant read 10 passage use eye-tracking device . A group statistical analysis perform .</detailed_description>
