	<brief_summary>The primary objective research measure neurochemical activate human brain normoxia ( normal oxygen availability ) induce mild hypoxia ( reduce oxygen availability ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Changes Activated Human Visual Cortex During Mild Hypoxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal determine effect mild hypoxia human brain energy metabolism healthy young adult subject . For purpose , Investigator utilize non-invasive imaging modality base functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) spectroscopy ( fMRS ) , subject expose well-controlled gas mixture resemble condition either normoxia mild hypoxia . Identifying impact mild hypoxia functional brain energy metabolism healthy human brain crucial step generate hypothesis multiple patient population experience mild hypoxia consequence pathological condition , sleep apnea traumatic brain injury . The Investigator hypothesize energetic demand neuronal activation reveal fMRS affect mild hypoxia , despite altered hemodynamic response observe fMRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Those volunteer evaluate normal meet exclusion criterion potential candidate study . Subjects type bioimplant activate mechanical , electronic , magnetic mean ( e.g . cochlear implant , pacemaker , neurostimulators , biostimulators , electronic infusion pump , etc. ) . Subjects type ferromagnetic bioimplant could potentially displace damage , aneurysm clip , metallic skull plate , etc . Pregnant female ( questionable doubt , selftest counter pregnancy kit ) . Subjects exhibit noticeable anxiety and/or claustrophobia . Subjects adhere experimental protocol reason . Subjects cardiac know circulatory impairment , and/or inability perspire ( poor thermoregulatory function ) . Subjects know condition lead emergency medical care . Been diagnose physician psychiatric disorder , substance abuse , neurological , cardiovascular . Been diagnose physician respiratory disease . Had brain tumor stroke .
