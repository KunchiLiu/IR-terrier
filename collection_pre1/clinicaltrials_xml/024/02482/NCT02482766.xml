	<detailed_description>EFFICACY OF A NEW TECHNIQUE - '' IN-REC-SUR-E '' - IN PRETERM NEONATES WITH RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME DURING NON INVASIVE VENTILATION : A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL BACKGROUND The initial stabilization Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) provision rescue surfactant necessary least beneficial quite possibly preferred standard therapy intubation infant risk delivery room subsequent support mechanical ventilation ( 2-4 ) . The percentage CPAP failure newborns 25-28 week ' gestation 45 % ( 30/66 ) Australian experience ( 5 ) , high report Ammari et al . ( 25 % ) ( 6 ) similar report De Jaegere et al . ( 50 % ) ( 7 ) COIN trial ( 46 % ) ( 2 ) . As potential alternative , INSURE ( INtubate , SURfactant , Extubate ) approach ( 8 ) attractive . Recently , several study investigate effectiveness association non-invasive ventilation surfactant , administer transient intubation ( INSURE ) , show effective prevent need mechanical ventilation . Although beneficial clinical practice , INSURE method universally apply preterm neonate Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( RDS ) unsuccessful particular section population . The INSURE failure rate recently report preterm infant different gestational age widely range 19 % 69 % ( 10 , 11 ) . Unfortunately , randomize control trial directly evaluate efficacy INSURE extremely preterm neonate ( &lt; 28 week gestation ) ( 8 ) . Nevertheless , data `` Sustained Lung Inflation ( SLI ) study '' ( 14 ) recently conduct infant GA 25+0- 28+6 week show nasal CPAP failure need Mechanical Ventilation ( MV ) 72 hour life 53 % SLI group 65 % control group ( nasal CPAP ) . In study surfactant preferably administer INSURE approach Fraction Inspired Oxygen ( FiO2 ) threshold 0.40 could reasonably argue least 50 % 25-28 week ' gestation infant , even receive SLI maneuver INSURE treatment CPAP failure , undergoes mechanical ventilation first 72 hour life unsuccessful INSURE . One possible mechanism responsible unsuccessful INSURE , require subsequent re-intubation mechanical ventilation inability preterm lung RDS achieve maintain `` optimal '' Functional Residual Capacity ( FRC ) . Prophylactic early rescue surfactant administration alveolar recruitment probably result uneven surfactant distribution already open alveolus thus result poor clinical response first surfactant treatment . We , therefore , seek compare application recruitment manoeuver - High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation ( HFOV ) modality - surfactant administration , follow rapid extubation ( INtubate-RECruited-SURfactant-Extubation : IN-REC-SUR-E ) INSURE alone spontaneously breathe preterm infant require nasal CPAP initial respiratory support reach pre-defined CPAP failure criterion , evaluate effectiveness decrease need MV improve respiratory outcome . Study design This unblinded multi-center randomize trial IN-REC-SUR-E vs. IN-SUR-E infant born 24+0-27+6 week ' gestation . Sample size The investigator hypothesize recruitment manoeuver ( HFOV modality ) surfactant administration might decrease need subsequent mechanical ventilation first 72 hour life 50 % ( 2 , 5 , 7 ) 30 % . The investigator calculate 103 newborn must enrol group detect difference statistically significant 80 % power 0.05 level . Randomisation Infants unit block ( 1st block : gestational age 24+0 25+6 week ; 2nd block : gestational age 26+0 27+6 week ) randomly assign treatment group use automatically generate sealed envelope prepare Policlinico A. Gemelli Hospital Rome distribute participate center . Permutated block randomization 1:1 randomization two arm use . Blinding The study blind , staff performing study also take care infant later . However , decision start mechanical ventilation make clinician investigator , moreover , parent , nurse involve patient care researcher assess study end-points blind nature study treatment . To minimize bias , strict criterion definition maintain trial . Management Delivery Room Positive pressure neonatal mask T-piece system ( Neopuff Infant Resuscitator , Fisher Paykel , Auckland , New Zealand ) use stabilize newborn birth . All neonate receive one ( two ) SLI manoeuver ( ) ( 25 cmH2O 10-15 second ) ( 14 ) transfer Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) nasal CPAP ( 6 cmH2O ) . Infants start mechanical ventilation agreement American Academy Paediatrics guideline neonatal resuscitation ( 16 ) . In latter case baby exclude study ( see exclusion criterion section , page 4 ) . CPAP Failure Criteria In NICU , nasal CPAP give nasal prongs/mask use standard method single centre ( ventilator , flow-dependent system ) initial pressure 6 7 cmH2O , infant . CPAP failure define meet follow criterion : FiO2 â‰¥ 0.30 nasal CPAP ( 17 ) maintain pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) 87-94 % ( 18 ) least 30 minute unless rapid clinical deterioration occur , respiratory acidosis define pCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg ( 8.5 kPa ) pH &lt; 7.20 arterial capillary blood gas sample , apnea define &gt; 4 episode apnea per hour &gt; 2 episode apnea per hour ventilation bag mask require . HFOV Recruitment manoeuver Infants IN-REC-SUR-E group undergo follow approach : intubation , HFOV deliver ventilator available NICU . The following initial ventilator set advocate : Continuous Distending Pressure ( CDP ) : 8cmH2O ; Frequency : 10-15 Hz ; Delta P : 15 cmH2O Amplitude 30 % eventually increase - chest `` visibly vibrate `` - ; I : E 1:2 . Delta P ( amplitude ) first and/or frequency subsequently adjust achieve Tidal Volume ( VT ) 1,5-2 ml/kg and/or maintain transcutaneous partial carbon dioxide pressure ( TcPCO2 ) 40 60 mmHg ( 5.3 8.0 kPa ) . The infant subject open lung ventilation strategy aim recruit stabilize majority collapse alveoli/sacculi , use oxygenation indirect parameter lung volume . Optimal recruitment define adequate oxygenation use FiO2 0.25 le . Starting 8 cmH2O , CDP increase stepwise ( 2 cmH2O every 2-3 minute ) long SpO2 improves . The FiO2 reduce stepwise , keep SpO2 within target range ( 87-94 % ) . The recruitment procedure stop oxygenation longer improve FiO2 equal less 0.25 . The corresponding CDP call opening pressure ( CDPO ) . Next , CDP reduce stepwise ( 1-2 cmH2O every 2-3 minute ) SpO2 deteriorate ( least 2-3 point ) . The corresponding CDP call closing pressure ( CDPC ) . After second recruitment manoeuver CDPO 2 minute , optimal CDP ( CDPOPT ) set 2 cmH2O CDPC least 3 minute ( 19 ) . A chest radiograph point advise . Surfactant Treatment Infants IN-REC-SUR-E arm undergo follow approach : soon possible recruitment manoeuver ( CDPOPT ) dose poractant alfa ( Curosurf [ Chiesi Farmaceutici , Parma , Italy ] ) 200 mg/kg administer via close administration system one-two aliquot ( 1-2 minute ) . The tube position confirm auscultation . A temporary reduction frequency may necessary increase VT 2.5 ml/kg improve surfactant spreading . Infants IN-SUR-E arm undergo follow approach : intubation , dose poractant alfa ( Curosurf [ Chiesi Farmaceutici , Parma , Italy ] ) 200 mg/kg administer via close administration system one-two aliquot ( 1-2 minute ) . The tube position confirm auscultation . During surfactant administration , infant manually ventilate facilitate surfactant distribution . If necessary , mechanical ventilation peak inspiratory pressure ( PIP ) 20-22 cmH2O , Positive End-Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ) 5-6 cmH2O respiratory rate 30-40 breaths/min subsequently start achieve VT 4-6 ml/kg and/or maintain transcutaneous partial carbon dioxide pressure ( TcPCO2 ) 40 60 mmHg ( 5.3 8.0 kPa ) . After surfactant administration , baby group extubated within 30 minute ( satisfactory respiratory drive present ) receive nasal CPAP ( 6-8 cmH2O ) ( 20 ) . In case insufficient respiratory drive , CDP ( baby IN-REC-SUR-E arm ) PIP ( IN-SUR-E arm ) reduce spontaneous respiratory activity restore . Maintaining FiO2 &lt; 0.30 obtain SpO2 value desire range ( 87-94 % ) drive eventual reduction level CPAP follow day . The decision whether begin Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ( BiPAP ) nasal-Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation ( N-IMV ) prevent need re-intubation infant group neonatologist duty , consider final analysis . Infants group receive subsequent dose surfactant ( 100 mg/kg poractant alfa ) use method ( INSURE INRECSURE ) meet CPAP failure criterion follow 12 24 hour . Data collection All collect data obtain clinical record . They report electronic data sheet design study . Statistical analysis The primary efficacy analysis conduct intention treat basis . Clinical characteristic infant `` IN-REC-SUR-E '' `` IN-SUR-E '' group describe use mean value standard deviation , median value range , rate percentage . Univariate statistical analysis perform use Student `` '' test parametric continuous variable , Wilcoxon rank-sum test non-parametric continuous variable , Fisher 's exact test categorical variable .
