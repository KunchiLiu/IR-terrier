	<detailed_description>Currently commonly perform definitive treatment symptomatic esophago-gastric junction outflow obstruction laparoscopic esophageal myotomy ( LEM ) . In procedure outer longitudinal inner circular muscle fiber distal esophagus proximal stomach divide , release spasm result open lumen . Although procedure effective relieving trouble swallow improve esophageal emptying , often accompany development GERD ( muscle division result incompetence antireflux barrier , low esophageal sphincter ) . For reason laparoscopic esophageal myotomy often accompany fundoplication , part fundus stomach fold around distal esophagus suture place , recreate flap-valve mechanism . ( It best perform time laparoscopic myotomy reoperation area difficult ) . The fundoplication however may imperfect , may result degree outflow obstruction fail control reflux . LEM result 80 % 90 % global patient satisfaction ; 10-20 % continue experience moderate dysphagia 10-35 % GERD esophageal pH test . Others evaluate possibility surgically divide muscle fiber within esophagus , use endoscope rather laparoscope , animal model . The first human experience report Japan use per-oral endoscope ( ) incise mucosa proximal esophagus entry point , ( b ) create submucosal tunnel downwards , ( c ) perform esophageal myotomy distal esophageal circular muscle , ( ) close mucosal entry site clip . The creation submucosal tunnel distance myotomy safety measure , mucosal closure fail , native tissue appose help seal leak ( rather like Z-entry thoracentesis ) . Subsequent initial report , multiple single-arm study report technique safe associate excellent medium-term relief dysphagia.. In POEM technique fundoplication perform . By endoscopic creation esophageal submucosal tunnel inner circular muscle layer could easily visualize contrast conventional laparoscopic esophageal myotomy , author describe division inner circular esophageal muscle layer leave out longitudinal muscle layer intact . The distal esophagus expose LEM , hence disrupt attachment diaphragm . These attachment contribute overall antireflux mechanism . It hypothesize divide inner circular muscle , disrupt contribution outer longitudinal muscle diaphragmatic attachment antireflux mechanism , POEM may potential reflux LEM . If case antireflux procedure may need POEM procedure .</detailed_description>
