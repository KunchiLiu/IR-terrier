	<brief_title>Comprehensive Management Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) characterize repetitive obstruction upper airway sleep . OSAS associate wide range health consequence daytime sleepiness , cognitive impairment metabolic cardiovascular disease . In Spain prevalence disease 3 6 % , constitute public health problem . The recommend first line treatment OSAS continuous positive pressure airway ( CPAP ) . Physical exercise show ameliorate consequence OSAS cardiovascular disease , glucose intolerance fatigue . Scientific study show vigorous physical activity associate decrease prevalence OSAS , improve sleep efficiency Epworth Sleepiness Scale . Moreover , recent evidence show oropharyngeal exercise useful treatment OSAS decrease neck circumference , snore , subjective sleepiness AHI well improve quality life saturation oxygen . The 60-70 % patient OSAS overweight obese show high body mass index ( BMI ) independent risk factor occurrence OSAS . Many study show weight loss associate significant reduction AHI . However , despite scientific evidence justify inclusion modality , study analyzed impact perform together intervention . It expect combination produce cumulative effect impact significantly improve indicator OSAS . The investigator include patient recent diagnosis moderate severe OSA . Patients randomized interventional control group . Patients include study follow almost three month examine baseline time follow-up intervention .</detailed_description>
