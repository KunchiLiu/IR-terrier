	<brief_summary>Whole-body periodic acceleration ( WBPA ) new , non-invasive , promising therapy diverse grow list disorder include cardiovascular disease 6 . During WBPA , patient lie supine position bed capable translate back forth parallel ground , along head-to-foot axis patient . Thus , treatment best described form `` passive exercise . '' The frequency translation ( 180 cycles/minute ; cpm ) well distance travel ( 2-24mm ) bed adjust patient health care professional . The science behind therapeutic effect WBPA still remain largely unknown . The objective study determine WBPA may use effective way reduce lactic acid concentration recovery intense exercise rapidly previously establish method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each visit Subjects perform grade treadmill exercise test . They rest 10 minute . At end rest period , rest vital sign ( HR BP ) record well rest oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) . Resting capillary blood sample take analyzed Accutrend portable lactate analyzer measure blood lactate level . The cardiac metabolic recording measure PFT GX machine ( Medgraphics Ultima ; St. Paul , Minnesota ) record VO2 , VCO2 , RER ( respiratory exchange ratio ) , Ve . Heart Rate monitor PolarÂ® HR monitor . This machine attach motorize treadmill handrail . Each subject perform Modified Bruce Protocol consist maximum five 3-minute stage . The criterion set peak exercise one following : 1 ) 90 % THR ; 2 ) plateau oxygen uptake indicate ; 3 ) subject unable maintain pace treadmill ; 4 ) RER 1.0 and/or 5 ) plateau Ve ( 3 ) . Additionally , American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) guideline terminate exercise testing follow ( American College Sports Medicine ) . TIMELINE PROCEDURES The following recovery test 3 separate day : Visit 1 The subject walk 30-40 % V02 max next 20 minute treadmill peak exercise . Blood lactate take minute 20 . Visit 2 The subject take treadmill 3 minute walk place WBPA bed . The horizontal displacement hold constant 14 mm , cycles/min hold constant 140 . There footboard subject foot strap wear shoe . The platform move repetitive motion head-to- foot impart mild periodic inertial force subject 's spinal axis ( pGz ) . Blood lactate take minute 20 . Visit 3 The subject take treadmill 3 minute walk ask sit chair 20 minute . Blood lactate take minute 20 .</detailed_description>
