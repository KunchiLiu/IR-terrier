	<brief_title>MEDIHONEY速 Gel Versus Collagenase Wound Debridement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND An important aspect wound bed preparation heal graft recognition wound often underlie pathogenic abnormality cause necrotic tissue accumulate . Therefore , order facilitate wound progression , repeat removal necrotic tissue may necessary long wound chronic . Debridement define removal nonviable material , foreign body , poorly heal tissue wound . Although surgeon recognize importance debridement , data generate randomized trial support use . Traditionally , debridement undertaken single therapeutic step within defined time frame . The direct form debridement surgical excision . Although may applicable acute wound , unlikely remove necrotic burden may continually accumulate chronic wound . Although form debridement include enzymatic biologic ; case non-healing wound , form debridement compel evidence heal efficacy autolytic debridement , Therefore , patient poor candidate surgical debridement limit access surgeon , autolytic debridement may consider effective form continuous debridement . 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective study evaluate non-inferiority MEDIHONEY速 Gel ( Active Leptospermum Honey-ALH Gel ) compare ( Santyl ) Collagenase , two FDA cleared/approved treatment , respect percent reduction necrotic ( include slough eschar ) tissue wind end 14 day +/- 2 day . 2.2 Secondary Objective The secondary objective study compare two treatment group respect percent reduction randomization necrotic tissue ( include slough eschar ) week 1 , 3 4 +/- 2 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A sign date informed consent obtain subject . Subject able willing comply study procedure . Subject able comply weekly visit . Subject 18 year age old . There presence least 50 % great necrotic tissue ( include slough eschar ) wound bed total wound surface area &gt; 1cm2 &lt; 64cm2 . Subject currently use parenteral oral antibiotic except UTI . Diabetic subject : HbA1c &lt; 12.0 % within 90 day precede enrollment . Prealbumin great 16 mg/dl within 90 day precede enrollment . Subject pressure ulcer must currently receive adequate pressure redistribution affect area via group 2 3 specialty bed , static wheel chair cushion patient bed . Subject diabetic plantar surface ulcer use offload boot ambulatory . Subject venous ulcer must currently receive use compression therapy manage daily . Subject caregiver trainable able perform dressing change . Subject allergy collagenase honey . Subject allergy semiocclusive absorptive secondary dressing . If subject multiple wound wound fit inclusion criterion select . If one wound meet criteria large wound select . Steroid use &gt; 5mg daily . Subject unable cooperate offload and/or compression recommendation . ABI = &gt; 0.8 wound locate low extremity . Wound presence callus require sharp surgical debridement within 3 day prior randomization and/or need debridement use method study agent throughout study treatment . Subject medical instability deem investigator . Subject pregnant . Subject participate another clinical trial wound dress evaluation 30 day prior enrollment .</criteria>
