	<detailed_description>Marrow adipocytes identify component bone marrow micro-environment . Evidence exist suggest marrow fat play important physiologic role bone mineral energy metabolism human . Studies show nutritional status , particularly body fat distribution , may important marrow fat . For example , anorexia nervosa , state low body fat , associate elevate marrow adiposity low bone mineral density . However , know whether direct response nutritional deprivation hormonal change occur anorexia nervosa . Drugs know cause adipose redistribution associate low bone mass , thiazolidinediones glucocorticoid , also show stimulate accumulation marrow adipocytes . Therefore , relationship bone marrow fat , bone mass , body fat depot hormone regulator dynamic one yet well understood . Although study show inverse relationship high marrow adiposity low bone mineral density ( BMD ) , physiologic role marrow adipose tissue define relationship hormonal factor human . A role marrow adipose tissue ( MAT ) mineral energy metabolism support fact number pathologic state associate increased marrow adiposity . Visceral adipose tissue , intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) , intrahepatic lipid ( IHL ) serum triglyceride , elevate obesity , also positive predictor MAT , whether acute weight gain human result elevate marrow adiposity unknown . Therefore observe change marrow fat acute weight gain acute nutritional deprivation understand role marrow adiposity energy homeostasis . While known marker bone formation dramatically decrease 4 day fasting , know quickly marrow fat change response physiologic cue . In rat model , increase marrow fat observe 14 day space suggest change marrow adiposity may occur acutely human model well .</detailed_description>
