	<brief_summary>The conventional treatment spinal cord injury ( SCI ) include physical therapy rehabilitation case may require surgical intervention . Although improved emergency care aggressive treatment help prevent damage even restore minimal sensory function , still large proportion patient suffer prolonged disability . It lead neurologist search new treatment option otherwise debilitate disorder . Recent advance research develop good understanding stem cell biology especially role tissue repair regeneration . Encouraging result pre-clinical phase limit human trial prove stem cell safely effectively deliver injured site regeneration damage tissue . Although variety cell type try role repair spinal cord injury , majority clinical trial employ stem cell take bone marrow especially mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC ) . Bone marrow MSCs good choice regenerative therapy owe advantage like ease collection ex-vivo culturing , immune tolerance ability differentiate variety cell type include neuronal lineage cell . Intravenous application direct injection MSCs cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via lumber puncture animal model SCI brain trauma show MSCs migrate towards integrate injure spinal tissue reduce cyst size increase functional recovery . The literature indicate acute , sub-acute chronic injury therapeutic target MSC grafting . The mechanism action may however vary among condition . In acute phase , MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role , sub-acute/chronic setting may use neurostimulator cell bridge effect possibly glial neuronal cell replacement . The investigator propose non-randomized , single group , open label , phase-I , interventional study evaluate safety efficacy intrathecal delivery patient 's ( autologous ) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell treatment spinal cord injury . This include determination functional recovery ( neuro-muscular control sensation ) affect area overall improvement quality life patient also take account side effect , observe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation Spinal Cord Injury- A Phase I Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role regenerative therapy gain importance due increase number SCI wake recent anti-terrorism operation arm force non-availability curative treatment category patient . The promising result preliminary clinical trial prove adult stem cell especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell safely inject well tolerate show functional improvement SCI patient . The successful treatment patient improve functional status otherwise debilitate patient , also reduce burden health care facility . Mesenchymal stem cell show promote anatomical functional recovery animal model SCI promote tissue sparing , axonal regeneration , remyelination . Therapeutic effect MSCs primarily due secretion soluble factor provision extracellular matrix provide protection support repair . MSC attractive candidate transplantation human patient easily harvest , expand bank , derive directly patient allow autologous transplantation , obviate need immune suppression . In study patient suffer sub-acute chronic phase spinal cord injury shall include . Patients undergo detailed screening MRI motor sensory assessment ASIA score . Further evaluation include electromyography ( EMG ) test electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) also do . Bone marrow aspiration do iliac crest patient , follow mononuclear cell ( MNCs ) separation density gradient centrifugation . MNCs wash cultured tissue culture flask . After 48 hour non-adherent cell remove culture . Medium change twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence . At point MSCs harvest microbiological quality control test cellular preparation dilute final concentration infuse intrathecal injection . Primary outcome measure safety determine clinical evaluation two independent neurologist one month hospital stay receive treatment course . Secondary outcome measure include American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) impairment scale NCV/EMG .</detailed_description>
