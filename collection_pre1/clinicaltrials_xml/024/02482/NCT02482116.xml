	<brief_title>A Comparison Diagnostic Approaches Malaria Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of preventable treatable disease , malaria pneumonia significant contributor under-five mortality Nigeria . To reduce burden disease , Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) guideline develop World Health Organisation ( WHO ) use first point contact ( e.g. , primary healthcare centre ) child age five year old . Preliminary literature review suggest although intervention base numerous diagnostic approach trialed , burden malaria pneumonia remain unacceptably high Nigeria , suggest limited effectiveness exist approach . Therefore , study aim compare accuracy different early diagnostic approach use community ( e.g . WHO Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) guideline versus gold standard diagnostic test comprise microscopy malaria chest radiography pneumonia ) child age five year present suspect malaria pneumonia primary healthcare centre Benin City , Edo State Nigeria . The research compare accuracy various diagnostic approach use measure sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , area receiver operate characteristic curve . The research also assess patient outcome like complication , hospitalisation death follow diagnosis either pneumonia malaria study participant well cost associate malaria pneumonia .</detailed_description>
