	<brief_summary>Medication discrepancy , define unintentional difference find patient ' medical record patient ' report medication taking , occur frequently hospital discharge , predispose adverse drug event ( ADEs ) , emergency department visit readmission . Resolving medication discrepancy - medication reconciliation - mandate every care transition , little know intervention strategy improve medication reconciliation post-discharge period , patient may lack prompt access primary care high risk ADEs . To address gap , investigator develop pilot test Secure Messaging Medication Reconciliation Tool ( SMMRT ) , pharmacist communicate Veterans review medication reconcile discrepancy hospital discharge via Secure Messaging ( SM ) , within My HealtheVet ( MHV ) , VA 's patient portal . The objective The SMMRT Trial therefore To optimize end-users ' experience SMMRT usability test refinement tool ; To conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) usual care vs. usual care plus MHV Training vs. usual care plus MHV Training plus SMMRT reduce hospital utilization ; To evaluate Veterans staff perceive impact SMMRT routine clinical practice , specifically , Veterans ' interaction primary care provider .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Procedure Work Done Richard L. Roudebush VAMC Indianapolis Aim 1 SMMRT conduct Human-Computer Interaction &amp; Simulation Laboratory within HSR &amp; D Center Health Information Communication Richard L. Roudebush VAMC Indianapolis , IN . The work Indianapolis include formal usability test SMMRT access improve usability pharmacist , nurse , patient . Ten VA pharmacist , 10 VA nurse , 10 VA patient participate usability test Indianapolis . They assess well SMMRT interface support respective medication reconciliation task . Pharmacists work Roudebush VAMC responsibility medication reconciliation normal work eligible participate study . Roudebush VAMC nurse work part Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) eligible . Eligible patient must take least 5 medication must discharge Roudebush VAMC within last 30 day . Veterans exclude cognitively impair , base Callahan screener . Patients recruit regardless prior MHV use . No patient previous experience SMMRT , new feature MHV . Usability test session 30 minute include audio video recording computer screen movement participant 's face . A standardized script read participant instruct certain task evaluate specific usability issue SMMRT . The participant enter reconcile medication SMMRT complete work send research team analysis . Although investigator intend complete data collection procedure Aim 1 Indianapolis VA , investigator note submit grant proposal ( Section 4.g.1 ) investigator would recruit ( VA ) Boston pharmacists Aim 1 data collection unlikely event investigator recruit sufficient number Indianapolis . If unlikely contingency arises ( i.e. , investigator determine need recruit pharmacist VA Boston ) , investigator submit amendment VA Boston IRB appropriate consent authorization form time . Study Procedure Work VABHS A three-armed randomized control trial ( RCT ) ( Aim 2 ) formative evaluation SMMRT ( Aim 3 ) conduct VA Boston Healthcare System 's West Roxbury inpatient facility . The usability testing result Aim 1 Indianapolis incorporate improve SMMRT RCT conduct . The RCT compare effectiveness ( 1 ) Usual Care ( UC ) , ( 2 ) UC plus MyHealtheVet ( MHV ) enrollment training , ( 3 ) UC plus MHV training plus medication reconciliation pharmacist use SMMRT . The RCT enroll 1,400 hospitalized Veterans VA Boston ass main outcome hospital utilization ( include hospital readmission emergency room ) 30 day discharge . Secondary outcome assess include medication discrepancy , community tenure , measure patient satisfaction self-efficacy related medication use . Aim 2 : Dr. Simon research team member meet clinical team describe study patient recruitment eligibility . Research assistants review daily census hospitalize Veterans ascertain anticipated discharge date identify Veterans obvious exclusion criterion . After patient complete consent-to-contact form , research assistant introduce patient study . Interested patient screen eligibility eligible consented participation . Veterans eligible study age 18 old , VA primary care provider VISN-1 VA facility , discharge home , computer internet access , discharge least five medication , cognitively impair ( base Callahan screener ) . Patients randomly assign one three study arm . Usual care ( UC ) include medication reconciliation every transition hospitalization . At discharge , Veteran receive printed list medication instruction . After discharge , Veterans receive `` care coordination '' telephone call , ideally within 2 business day hospital discharge , nurse Patient Aligned Care Team ( PACT ) . The call include review symptom , diet , activity , upcoming visit , medication , medication reconciliation usually occur call . The study arm UC MHV include describe UC plus train MHV . Veterans yet enrol MHV assist enrol complete in-person authorization . Key feature MHV explain demonstrated Veterans , include secure messaging ( SM ) , Blue Button , send message recognize received message . They also instruct regard SMMRT . Participants show save , edit , re-attach attachment SM . Usual care MHV training SMMRT include previously describe care well communication pharmacist discharge SMMRT . In SMMRT intervention arm , pharmacist review patient chart within 3 day discharge , reconcile medication SMMRT add photographs patient 's medication Medication Image Library ( MIL ) . The SMMRT send patient pharmacist review . The patient encourage medication review edit SMMRT reflect actually take . The patient sends SMMRT back pharmacist . The pharmacist record medication reconciliation Computerized Patient Record Systems ( CPRS ) communicate PCP urgent unclear issue . The pharmacist send final SMMRT patient . Research assistant blind participant ' study arm contact participant phone 30 day discharge learn hospital visit since discharge . This 30-40 minute interview follow write protocol also obtain information regard patient 's medication discrepancy , health status , satisfaction care post-discharge , self-efficacy relate take medication . Reminder letter send week schedule phone interview . Letters send reschedule phone call Veteran unreachable several attempt . A data abstraction tool develop use obtain participant 's hospital utilization information , include reason , length , whether plan . CPRS CDW review find date hospital readmission emergency department visit . The research assistant also uncover participant reach `` care coordination '' call medication reconciliation occur conversation . Interview data record analyzed SAS . Aim 3 involve in-depth interview Veterans staff within two week study completion understand characteristic MHV SMMRT user prefer . A subset participant Aim 2will select participate Aim 3 . Twenty Veteran participant study arm participate interview Aim 3 . The investigator use semi-structured interview guide include core list question supplement prepared spontaneous follow-up question seek clarification example . The interview identify factor relate successful unsuccessful implementation MHV Training SMMRT intervention . The interview design encourage Veterans provide feedback specific detail intervention find helpful feature confuse helpful . The investigator also recruit 15-20 PACT nurse brief , focus interview explore SMMRT influence post-discharge call generally workflow communication Veterans .</detailed_description>
