	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot randomize trial determine feasibility e-cigarettes telephone counselling ( compare transdermal nicotine replacement telephone counsel ) harm-reduction tool may lead increase smoke cessation perioperative setting smoker present elective surgery San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center . Secondary outcome include acceptability e-cigarettes transdermal nicotine replacement , length-of-stay post-anesthesia care unit , hospital length-of-stay , postoperative complication within first 30-days , smoke status 8-weeks randomization . This pilot study design provide preliminary data necessary plan fund larger-scale randomized clinical trial assess utility e-cigarettes achieve smoke cessation perioperatively . Our ultimate goal add limit exist data safety efficacy e-cigarette use smoking cessation , specifically perioperative setting risk continue smoke great motivation stop high .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well-known smoker suffer complication high risk mortality surgery non-smokers . Despite knowledge , unclear clinician minimize risk . Surgery represent 'teachable moment ' might encourage smoker engage permanent cessation . Several small trial show smoke cessation intervention increase smoke cessation reduce postoperative complication , particularly wound-healing complication , absolute risk reduction 25 % . Smoking cessation initiate perioperative period also promote long-term smoking cessation . Despite benefit comprehensive smoke cessation intervention include nicotine replacement therapy , current standard care SFVAMC routinely include specific preoperative smoking cessation pharmacotherapy counsel . Although urgent need data , e-cigarettes propose alternative nicotine replacement therapy least effective smoking cessation , may acceptable patient . The main hypothesis pilot study use e-cigarettes telephone counselling , compare telephone counsel transdermal nicotine replacement , perioperative period result increase smoking cessation day surgery 8-weeks randomization smoker present elective surgery . As secondary hypothesis , study also assess acceptability e-cigarettes versus nicotine patch , postoperative complication within first 30-days , length-of-stay PACU hospital length-of-stay . The investigator examine hypothesis follow aim : `` Aim 1 ) To determine e-cigarettes plus counsel compare transdermal nicotine replacement plus counsel achievement smoking cessation , introduce prior elective surgery veteran . The investigator plan carry-out pilot randomize control trial parallel design compare e-cigarettes telephone counsel transdermal nicotine replacement telephone counselling . Our primary outcome smoking cessation day surgery , confirm biochemically exhale carbon monoxide . Smoking reduction ( self-reported cigarette per day ) 50 % bedside spirometry reading assess secondary outcomes. `` Aim 2 ) To determine acceptability e-cigarettes amongst veteran aid smoke cessation determine feasibility recruitment , randomization , follow-up procedure preparation large-scale trial . Through implementation pilot trial , investigator determine feasibility acceptability e-cigarettes smoke cessation perioperatively veteran population obtain preliminary data necessary run large trial effectiveness e-cigarettes perioperative smoking cessation aid. `` Aim 3 ) To determine safety e-cigarettes harm reduction strategy achieve short-term perioperative smoking cessation . The investigator plan improve overall knowledge safety short-term e-cigarettes use careful surveillance adverse event side effects. `` Aim 4 ) To determine e-cigarette use preoperatively associate low risk complication postoperatively . The investigator plan measure follow secondary outcome : postoperative complication mortality within first 30 day , post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) length-of-stay , hospital length-of-stay . This help u understand e-cigarettes potential use harm-reduction perioperatively .</detailed_description>
