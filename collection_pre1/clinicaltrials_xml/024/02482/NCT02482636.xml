	<brief_summary>This multicentre , parallel group , block randomise clinical trial aim investigate post booster antibody response UK infant give reduce prim schedule meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine . It provide information best include meningococcal B vaccine ( likely introduce late 2015 ) routine immunisation schedule . The UK Department Health provide routine vaccination schedule child UK advise Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation ( JCVI ) . The Department Health announce meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ) introduce routine schedule 2+1 schedule . Cost effectiveness could also improve remove current MenC conjugate vaccine dose give 3 month age . There publish immunogenicity data Bexsero give 2 , 4 12 month age ( 2+1 schedule ) concomitant Infanrix/IPV/Hib replace Pediacel infant programme . This change schedule would result three injection 2 , 4 12 month , give previous reluctance among parent three injection one visit , option reduce PCV13 1+1 schedule ( prim dose 3 month booster 12 month ) assess study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study 's primary objective ass antibody response pneumococcal vaccine final infant vaccination approximately 13 month age , secondary objective include antibody response follow meningococcal B C vaccine , tetanus , diphtheria pertussis vaccine . In addition , effect maternal pertussis vaccination pregnancy infant immune response vaccine , prevalence carriage pneumococcal serotypes 12 18 month age reactogenecity follow vaccine assess . 200 healthy child yet receive routine infant immunisation enrol 8 12 week old . Participants randomise one two group differ vaccine schedule . Children group receive routine immunisation follow change : addition 3 dos meningococcal B vaccine 2 , 4 12 month meningococcal C vaccine 12 month ( instead dose 3 12 month ) . The 2 group differ number dos 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV13 ) ; give either 2 , 4 , 12 month age ( currently give routine schedule ) 3 12 month age . Each participant 2 blood test : 5 13 month age , 2 nose swab : 12 18 month age address objective study . Parents ask complete health diary record adverse event 7 day follow vaccination continuous thermometer ( ibutton ) use record temperature 24 hour vaccination . If blood sample 13 month reveal antibody titres level indicative protection , recommendation make booster vaccination .</detailed_description>
