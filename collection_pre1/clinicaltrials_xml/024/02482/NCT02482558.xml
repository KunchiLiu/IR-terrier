	<brief_title>Investigating Effects High GI Versus Low GI Diet Hepatic Metabolism Satiety Levels Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>8 Healthy subject scan start end 7 day high versus low glycaemic diet 4 week washout arm . During scan day hepatic glycogen response correspond high versus low glycaemic index test meal measure use 13C Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) explore acute change metabolic response . Baseline liver lipid level measure use 1H MRS explore long term change liver lipid level . Blood sample also obtain throughout test day measure blood glucose , insulin blood hormone response . Satiety survey also take throughout test day diet week . The main hypothesis one week calorie match Glycaemic index vary diet result alter response liver glycogen level acutely follow meal also long term hepatic liver lipid level . A secondary hypothesis also associate change blood sugar hormone level change effect satiety level subject .</detailed_description>
