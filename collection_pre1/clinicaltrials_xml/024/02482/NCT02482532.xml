	<brief_title>Vaccine Enriched , Autologous , Activated T-Cells Directed Tumor Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate progression free survival one ( 1 ) year &lt; 20 % patient stage IV metastatic melanoma , despite aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens newly approve immunomodulatory target therapy . Immunotherapy seem hold promise achieve prolonged survival even cure , therefore , effort focus several different approach . Such approach use tumor vaccination , adoptive transfer tumor infiltrate lymphocyte , even monoclonal antibody , unconjugated conjugate cytokine , toxin , radionucleotides . The tumor-associated antigen GD2 note surface several tumor , notably neuroblastoma , express melanoma well . Clinical study show activity GD2-specific chimeric T-cell receptor express activate , autologous , T-cells patient neuroblastoma . It investigators intention enrich peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient stage IV metastatic melanoma vaccine-specific T-cells pre-harvest/ phlebotomy vaccination common , well understood vaccine . The investigator modify T-cells attack GD2 antigen . These tumor redirect , vaccine specific , activate T-cells infused patient follow revaccination common vaccine . The Investigators monitor expansion modify T-cells serial polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay follow vaccination . The Investigators intend re-vaccinate select vaccine one month follow infusion monitor expansion modify T-cells .</detailed_description>
