	<brief_summary>Trial Rationale/ Justification To assess efficacy safety inhale Iloprost treatment naïve patient leave heart failure pulmonary hypertension , wait list orthotopic heart transplantation . As patient often show increase hemodynamic value wait donor organ , transplantation becomes infeasible time identification appropriate donor organ reach exclusion limit . Therefore , high need improvement stabilisation patient ' hemodynamic value PVR , PAP TPG . In retrospective , non-controlled study inhale Iloprost already show beneficial effect hemodynamics reduction PVR , TPG CI ( Schulz 2010 ) . Treatment inhale Iloprost could stabilize hemodynamics prevent patient classify ineligible time appropriate donor organ identify . However , adverse event profile regard frequency , time-dependency validate show safety tolerability inhale Iloprost indication . All patient transfer long-term medically supervised observation period inhale Iloprost therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific Background In many patient severe left heart failure ( LHF ) chronic pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) occur follow-up lead remodel pulmonary artery increase pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) transpulmonary gradient ( TPG ) . According International Society Heart Lung Transplantation German Standing Committee Organ Transplantation , cardiac transplantation contraindicate value PAP , PVR , and/or TPG 40 mmHg , 240 dyn x x cm-5 , 15 mmHg , respectively . Even patient show slightly elevate hemodynamic value time application transplantation , value often reach respective exclusion limit wait period . Patients sign transplantation partially longer electable orthotopic heart transplantation ( OHT ) time identification appropriate donor organ . In meantime time wait list heart transplantation increase . In 2001 , patient wait list undergoing heart transplantation within one year . In contrast , 972 patient wait list 325 heart transplantation perform Germany 2011 ( www.eurotransplant.nl ) . At present , specific therapy PH due leave heart disease available ( Galie 2009 ) , treatment PAH agent recommend due lack data ( Rosenkranz 2011 ) . There study PH-targeted medication within indication . Phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( e.g . Sildenafil ) , Endothelin-receptor antagonist Prostacyclin potential agent treatment PH wait period heart transplantation . Iloprost synthetic analogue Prostacyclin PGI2 . Iloprost dilate systemic pulmonary arterial vascular bed lead reduction blood pressure . In previous study investigator administer aerosolized Iloprost ( ILO ) 14 patient pulmonary hypertension due chronic cardiac failure wait list heart transplantation . Iloprost cause significant reduction pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance without severe side effect effective nitric oxide ( Sablotzky , Grünig et al . 2002 , 2003 ) . In retrospective non-controlled study 51 patient await orthotopic heart transplantation Iloprost inhalation cause significant decrease PVR ( 458 dyn x x cm-5 345 dyn x x cm-5 ) , significant decrease TPG ( 21 mmHg 17 mmHg ) , significant improvement Cardiac Index ( CI ) 2,09 l/min/m2 2,23 l/min/m2 ( Schulz et al. , 2010 ) . In retrospective non-controlled study low-dose Bosentan improve hemodynamic parameter 1-year survival rate 82 end-stage heart failure patient wait list cardiac transplantation ( Hefke et al. , 2011 ) . Randomized-controlled trial miss within indication . Sildenafil medication first choice due contraindication well many patient wait OHT treated nitrate ( medication due coronary heart disease ) . In contrast , inhale Iloprost advantageous effect coronary perfusion . However , indication adverse event profile inhale Iloprost regard frequency time-dependency yet clear . In Germany inhale Iloprost administer I-Neb AAD-System allow precise , reproducible dose drug . Due positive result retrospective analysis treatment patient pulmonary hypertension , initiation proof-of-concept study seem justified .</detailed_description>
