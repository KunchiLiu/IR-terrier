	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two barrier membrane product , Cytoplast ( dPTFE ) BioXclude ( human amnion chorion allograft ) , relative efficacy dental socket preservation procedure , socket fill overfilled freeze dry bone allograft ( FDBA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Alveolar Ridge Preservation Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blind , randomize clinical trial aim compare two different , commercially available material assess relative efficacy socket preservation procedure tooth extraction . Patients present single teeth deem clinically hopeless treatment plan removal normal course clinical dentistry consider study . If eligible , ridge/socket preservation procedure perform time extraction . Periodontics resident perform procedure supervision board certify staff . Patients randomize via concealed random number sequence one four group , base combination material graft placement technique . Patients equally distribute follow group : ( 1 ) dense polytetrafluoroethylene ( Cytoplast ) ( 2 ) Cytoplast additional buccal augmentation/onlay graft , ( 3 ) human amniotic-tissue derive membrane ( BioXclude ) , ( 4 ) BioXclude additional buccal augmentation/onlay graft . All four treatment group consistent current standard care , study seek compare technique material part routine , clinical/periodontal therapy order determine superiority . Approximately 150 patient enrol distribute equally among four group . Any post-operative complication manage document follow-up appointment 1 , 2 4 week . Cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) use primary assessment tool , scan compare pre-operative baseline time point scan take 4 month heal prepare implant placement . The primary dependent variable ( 1 ) percent baseline alveolar ridge change ( horizontal vertical ) ( 2 ) whether anticipate dental implant could place appropriately . Secondary outcome include ease use , perception pain , complication , cost-effectiveness , change keratinize tissue .</detailed_description>
