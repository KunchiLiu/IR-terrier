	<brief_title>Study Preoperative Boost Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study team propose trial build favorable result intraoperative boost trial use preoperative delivery approach . The PI demonstrate feasibility preoperative approach successfully complete Phase I dose-finding partial breast trial . The preoperative approach several advantage : 1 ) expensive intra-operative equipment unnecessary , 2 ) small intact breast tumor result significantly less uninvolved breast tissue receive high radiation dos likely decrease toxicity ; 3 ) accurate target high-risk area subclinical disease surround tumor possible , 4 ) small treatment volume amenable dose escalation accelerate treatment improve accessibility subject , 5 ) pre-operative approach provide novel opportunity study breast cancer radiation response . Radiotherapy intact tumor relatively rare event breast cancer irradiation , particularly set early stage breast cancer . Tumor normal tissue radiation response remain relatively poorly understood . Markers capable predict radiation response rare indeed . Therefore , pair pre- post-radiation tissue examine FAS gene expression compare among breast cancer subtypes . FAS name gene ( acronym ) know play critical role induction program cell death establish prognostic marker breast cancer . Previous study team finding FAS induction appear breast cancer subtype-specific previously observe provide possible explanation differential rate tumor response observe clinically distinct breast tumor subtypes . The study team 's preclinical work FAS suggest potential role radiation response biomarker . The study goal validate finding large cohort diverse breast cancer subject . However , preoperative delivery boost intact tumor unique , study include secondary cosmetic outcome include predefined stop boundary early indication suboptimal cosmetic outcome novel approach</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Women biopsy proven diagnosis ductal carcinoma situ invasive carcinoma breast . Biopsy tissue ( either slide block ) outside institution review confirm diagnosis . 2 . Breast preservation candidate ( prior breast nodal radiotherapy , image evidence multicentric disease prevent resection single incision , pregnant woman , comorbid condition preclude surgery ) 3. cTisT3 cancer judge benefit ( treat radiation oncologist ) tumor bed boost 4 . Women childbearing potential must consent use adequate contraception course study : ( 1 ) surgical sterilization ( tubal ligation hysterectomy ) , ( 2 ) approve hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill , patch , implant injection ) , ( 3 ) barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) use spermicide , ( 4 ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Contraceptive measure Plan B ( TM ) , sell emergency use unprotected sex , acceptable method routine use . 5 . White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 3000 , Hgb &gt; 10 , platelet &gt; 100000 within 30 day consent 6 . Eligible contrasted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) initial evaluation glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) â‰¥ 60 ml/min . A diagnostic MRI order within 60 day diagnosis consider acceptable alternative repeat . 7 . Outside breast imaging review Duke confirm finding consistent trial eligibility 1 . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2 . Breast implant breast treat ( contralateral breast implant acceptable ) 3 . Medical condition may increase risk poor cosmetic outcome ( i.e . Lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma ) 4 . Subjects unable receive study treatment plan secondary body habitus inability lie flat stomach least 1 hour 5 . Positive serum pregnancy test 6 . Insufficient breast imaging judge clinical stage 7 . Subjects without placement biopsy clip diagnostic procedure unwilling undergo clip placement . 8 . Subjects treatment plan constraint meet</criteria>
