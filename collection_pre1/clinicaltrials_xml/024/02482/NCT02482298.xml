	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effect Ticagrelor Reducing Number Days With Pain Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , study evaluate 2 dos ticagrelor 90 patient age 18 30 year , sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . Patients randomise double-blind double-dummy treatment period 1:1:1 ratio ( 30 treatment group ) receive ticagrelor 10 mg twice daily ( bid ) , ticagrelor 45 mg bid , placebo bid determine frequency day pain use electronic diary ( eDiary ) every day . Approximately 180 patient enrol . Patient follow safety assessment 2 week treatment completion . During 16 week treatment period , patient complete daily eDiary concern daily pain intensity , pain location , use analgesic absence school work . At end study patient ask rate change sickle cell pain compare start treatment . Platelet aggregation measure report P2Y12 reaction unit ( PRU ) pre-dose 2 hour post-dose week 4 week 5 treatment start . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter measure 2 hour post-dose week 4 , pre-dose 2 hour post-dose week 5 . Biomarkers assess pre-dose week 4 , week 5 week 8 . During study , patient evaluate adverse event ( AEs ) include bleed vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) .</detailed_description>
