	<detailed_description>After first medical visit ensure adolescent ability complete whole study , participant complete several clinical examination : - anthropometric measurement - Body composition assess DXA - Maximal aerobic test - Blood sample ( appetite-regulating hormone ) - daily energy intake assessment 24h intake exploration . The adolescent recruit randomly assign one two intervention group : - High Intensity program moderate intensity program . Those two physical activity program last 4-months compose 3 4 exercise session per week . The High intensity program consist High intensity interval exercise start 70 % adolescent ' capacity begin end around 95 % . The moderate intensity program propose continuous exercise set 50-65 % VO2max . No energy intake intervention perform . By end 4-months intervention , clinical examination perform intervention repeat .</detailed_description>
