	<detailed_description>Statin therapy improve coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) decrease cardiac morbidity mortality patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) hypercholesterolemia via pleiotropic effect statin , include regression atheroma , stabilization atherosclerotic plaque . Lipid lower statin also provide beneficial effect hypertensive patient average level serum total cholesterol Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm ( ASCOT-LLA ) . Improvements endothelial dysfunction CFR may relate beneficial effect statin hypertensive patient without hypercholesterolemia . Previously CFR could invasively measure use Doppler guide wire cardiac catheterization laboratory , recent advance echocardiographic image technique make feasible measure CFR noninvasively patient without CAD , highly correlate CFR measure invasive means.Accordingly , investigator recently demonstrate CFR significantly improve rosuvastatin therapy hypertensive patient average level serum cholesterol measure change CFR 1 year treatment rosuvastatin also find weak correlation change CFR change LDL cholesterol RESERVE ( Rosuvastatin Effect Coronary Flow Reserve Hypertensive Patients ) I trial . However , trial could include placebo-control group due limit study budget . Although CFR measure blind , batch reading store echocardiographic image , bias measurement might affect result . In previous study , study patient continue take antihypertensive medication educate follow lifestyle modification study period , may influence change CFR follow-up , absence placebo group make difficult exclude possibility lifestyle modification antihypertensive medication also play role improve CFR . Investigators hypothesize rosuvastatin added lifestyle modification superior lifestyle modification alone improve CFR control hypertensive patient cardiovascular risk , try examine hypothesis double-blind , randomize comparison study use echocardiography .</detailed_description>
