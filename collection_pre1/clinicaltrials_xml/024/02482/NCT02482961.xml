	<brief_title>Impact Plasma Levels Colistin Patients With Carbapenem Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acinetobacter baumanii usually cause pneumonia sepsis , susceptible antibiotic ampicillin/sulbactam carbapenem , easily become tolerant drug usable . Particularly Korean patient ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) , percentage carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ( CRAB ) increase recently . Colistin ( polymyxin E ) antibiotic polymyxin line use multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumonia , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , produce bactericidal action destroy bacterial cell membrane . Colistin antibiotic isolate Bacillius polymyxa subspecies colistinus first Japan 1949 , long use clinic since 1959 , use intravenous infusion decrease 1970s due acute kidney injury neurotoxicity . Recently , however , use frequently hospital infection multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria , result , various study conduct colistin . Colistin consist 30 different polymyxin compound include colistin A ( polymyxin E1 ) colistin B ( polymyxin E2 ) , colistimethate sodium ( CMS ) colistin sulfate use . In Korea , usually administer intravenously form CMS , inactive precursor . In body , CMS metabolize various metabolite include colistin discharge urine . In contrast , active metabolite colistin hardly discharge urine , remove non-renal elimination , accurate extracorporeal elimination mechanism still unknown . CMS reach peak serum concentration 10 minute intravenous administration , half-life 2.2 hour half-life colistin 18.5 hour . With regard bactericidal activity colistin , unbound area concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ( fAUC/MIC ) important , adequate exposure drug know important curative effect , still controversial optimal dose interval . Although drug use long , accurate measuring colistin blood concentration become possible mid 2000s , therefore , pharmacokinetic research drug conduct relatively recently increase interest validity establish us , adequate us , therapeutic drug monitoring , etc . Two established us drug intravenous administration 2.5~5mg/kg/day divide 2~4 time patient normal renal function , adjust dose interval administration accord renal function ( package insert ) , administration load dose follow 2~3 time administration depend renal function . The major side effect colistin nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity , accord recent study , incidence nephrotoxicity cause colistin 30~60 % . Renal insufficiency frequent vancomycin use together VAP . Renal insufficiency know reversible , case require dialysis . Known risk factor renal insufficiency include cumulative CMS dose , combine use drug induce renal insufficiency , female , age . There ex vivo study assess bactericidal effect colistin explore adequate us case study evaluate risk factor nephrotoxicity , one major side effect yet still controversial issue relate drug . Furthermore , study conduct Western subject , result hardly applicable Koreans . Thus , study purpose examine adequate range therapeutic concentration Korean people .</detailed_description>
