	<detailed_description>Hypertension common one major risk factor cardiovascular disease . Therefore , major societal economic health problem . A substantial proportion ( 20-40 % ) treat hypertensive patient sub-optimal blood pressure control despite use multiple drug . All patient increase cardio-vascular risk . Furthermore , use multiple drug diminishes compliance treatment , increase risk side effect . This underscore need new approach hypertension management . Elevated ( renal ) sympathetic nerve activity contribute importantly development hypertension subsequent vascular risk . Deliberate disruption sympathetic nerve activity ( sympatholytic therapy ) lead improvement vascular outcome blood pressure dependent blood pressure independent effect . Recently , promise novel sympatholytic approach introduce , i.e . catheter-based renal denervation small clinical trial resistant hypertensive patient . Many clinical centre start perform procedure process start . The Dutch Minister Health decide allow renal denervation patient call resistant hypertension , `` conditional reimbursement '' available start Jan 1st 2013 maximum 4 year . The Netherlands Organisation Health Research Development ( ZonMw ) provide u grant perform randomize trial ( SYMPATHY ) evaluate effect blood pressure 6 month intervention . Maximum follow-up trial 2 year . Important limitation study , firstly follow-up limited 2 year renal denervation . Secondly , patient undergo renal denervation , participate abovementioned trial . The Dutch National Renal Denervation Registry complement information trial several aspect . These deal safety , non-responders , sustainability . Objectives national database collect data deliver information : Safety : 1 . What short long term procedural relate complication ? Responders 2 . What predictor effect blood pressure , particular patient relate factor procedural related factor ? 3 . Are differences various renal denervation device ? Sustainability 4 . What effect blood pressure ( 3 ) , 6 , ( 9 ) , 12 , ( 18 ) , 24 , ( 30 ) , 36 , 60 month thereafter patient consider eligible base judgement treat physician ? 5 . What effect kidney function ( 3 ) , 6 , ( 9 ) , 12 , ( 18 ) , 24 , ( 30 ) , 36 , 60 month thereafter patient consider eligible base judgement treat physician ? 6 . What cardiovascular event rate population , strata achieve blood pressure level , potentially compare population . Methods : With database nationwide cohort build comprise patient treat renal denervation year , uniform baseline data collection uniform follow-up measurement term safety measurement , blood pressure measurement , hospitalisation , cardiovascular outcome all-cause mortality . The data collection occur web-based data entry application . All center Netherlands perform renal denervation ask participate . All patient underwent renal denervation include , irrespective reason device use . To address outstanding research question specific statistical analysis plan apply . Conclusion : Our expected result : 1. able identify patient characteristic , associate high probability favourable blood pressure response renal denervation , 2. provide short-and long-term ( 24 -60 month ) side effect renal denervation Perspective : These result , collect routine clinical practice large number clinic Netherlands , major impact treatment 'resistant hypertension ' . The safety efficacy data pave way formal cost-effectiveness analysis . The data potential high relevance decision policy maker government health insurance . When deem cost-effective safe , approach widely use treatment 'resistant hypertension ' revolutionise treatment patient . Furthermore , open way evaluation group patient characterize high sympathetic tone ; particular patient less severe hypertension , heart failure chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
