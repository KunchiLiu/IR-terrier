	<brief_title>Impact CPAP Treatment Arterial Stiffness Patients With T2DM Newly Diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) common disorder characterise recurrent episode apnoea hypopnoea sleep . OSA associate excessive daytime sleepiness link increased cardiovascular morbidity mortality . OSA alleviate Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) treatment . Cardiovascular disease major cause decrease life expectancy , morbidity reduce quality life patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Increased stiffness aorta associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality diabetic patient . Previous study report much high frequency OSA patient obesity T2D compare non-diabetic subject , find OSA associate arterial stiffness . However , whether CPAP treatment improve arterial stiffness insulin sensitivity T2D patient remain elucidated . Objective : To investigate effect three month ' treatment CPAP-device versus sham CPAP change arterial stiffness T2D patient newly detect OSA . Design : Randomised , control , multicentre study intervention CPAP treatment versus control group . The treatment period three month subsequent 9 month open extension . Patient population : 70 patient T2D newly diagnose OSA recruit Department Cardiology , Nephrology Endocrinology , Nordsjællands Hospital , Department Endocrinology , Gentofte University Hospital , Department Endocrinology Internal Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital Nørrebrogade Department Internal Medicine , Silkeborg Sygehus . Intervention : CPAP treatment versus control group . Endpoints : Primary endpoint : Change arterial stiffness measure office carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( cf-PWV ) start end 12 week intervention .</detailed_description>
