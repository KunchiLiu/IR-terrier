	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) secondary rupture aneurysm represent 5 15 % case stroke . The mortality rate SAH 40 % risk serious neurological sequela among survivor 10 20 % .The cause morbidity mortality mainly related initial damage induce SAH delay cerebral ischaemia ( DCI ) , generally secondary cerebral vasospasm . Cerebral vasospasm one main factor poor prognosis SAH , associate 1.5- 3-fold increase mortality rate 2 week follow SAH patient . Despite significant improvement time management disease fact rupture aneurysm often rapidly exclude surgical endovascular intervention , patient survive initial SAH remain risk severe complication follow 2 week . Vascular stenosis arterial segment , call cerebral vasospasm , observe 70 95 % case digital subtraction angiography 7th 14th day rupture aneurysm . This angiographic vasospasm responsible cerebral infarction 52 81 % case . Despite 50 year research , clearly demonstrated effective treatment vasospasm currently available . This multicentre , randomize , comparative study , include 364 patient acute phase follow ruptured aneurysm , management often limit control complication , exclusion aneurysm . The objective study validate efficacy transcutaneous trigeminal nerve stimulation prevention vasospasm limitation consequence delay cerebral ischaemia SAH . This innovative project , comprise intervention patient prior development complication could limit development complication . The prevention tool , base external facial nerve stimulation , totally innovative , reversible noninvasive technique . Use nerve stimulation indication never previously report could radically modify intensive care management disease year come .</brief_summary>
