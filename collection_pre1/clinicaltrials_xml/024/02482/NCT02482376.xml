	<detailed_description>In study , investigator hypothesize 21Gy deliver preoperatively large group subject pathologic complete response observe 20 % . Rationale single-fraction preoperative technique This trial propose build favorable result investigator ' phase I trial extend finding large cohort subject . The preoperative approach several advantage : 1. small intact breast tumor result significantly less uninvolved breast tissue receive high radiation dos likely decrease toxicity ; 2. accurate target high-risk area subclinical disease surround tumor possible , 3. small treatment volume amenable dose escalation accelerate treatment improve accessibility subject , 4. technical approach widely utilized tumor site deliver radiation facility 5. pre-operative approach provide novel opportunity study breast cancer radiation response .</detailed_description>
