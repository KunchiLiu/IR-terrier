	<detailed_description>Recruitment volunteer take place via announcement Anesthesiology Departmental Grand Rounds well flyer post UT Southwestern Department Anesthesiology &amp; Pain Management . After verbal consent obtain , volunteer place seated position . Upper-arm non-invasive blood pressure measure use WelchAllyn Propaq CS via standard size cuff place standard fashion elbow shoulder . Pulse oximetry measurement obtain use WelchAllyn Propaq CS via 4th digit hand . The smart phone application Instant Blood Pressure , Instant Blood Pressure Pro , Pulse Oximeter Pulse Oximeter Pro purchase principal investigator download via iTunes App Store onto iPhone 5S iOS 7.1.2 own principal investigator . The application-based measurement perform volunteer accord instruction application user without explanation investigator . Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , pulse ( P ) peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) collect 100 volunteer . Serial measurement take follow fashion : right upper extremity , smartphone application measurement , leave upper extremity repeat smartphone application measurement . Thus , volunteer data point reference record six time : two time use standard equipment reading ( one per extremity ) four time application-based reading ( two time per application ) . The two application measure blood pressure ( Instant Blood Pressure Instant Blood Pressure Pro ) utilize camera flashlight iPhone . In addition , Instant Blood Pressure application also utilize microphone instructs user hold iPhone chest specific fashion complete measurement . Both application also request user input certain demographic data : Gender , Age , Height Weight . In addition , one application ( Instant Blood Pressure Pro ) also instruct user input data `` Body Condition '' provide follow option : Poor , Below Average , Average , Above Average , Good , Excellent Athlete . The application provide direction one distinguish option . If application measure data base yet unexplained function use iPhone 's onboard technology , change demographic data alter result measurement . In way , sphygmomanometer pulse oximeter need know one 's gender , height , weight age accurately measure blood pressure pulse . The application base vital sign reading may change concert change demographic variable even though clinical vital sign monitor remain relatively consistent . To test hypothesis , subgroup ( n=20 ) , serial measurement use clinical vital sign application base vital sign reading evaluate change demographic variable application base vital sign monitor . For subgroup volunteer perform serial measurement follow change demographic data application : Correct data , Age + 10 , Age + 20 , Age - 10 , Age - 20 , Weight - 10 % , Weight - 25 % , Weight + 10 % Weight +25 % . Additionally , Instant Blood Pressure Pro application additional reading take change `` Body Condition '' demographic follow : Poor , Average , Good Athlete . For measurement take use application another take use clinical monitor , thirteen total reading per volunteer .</detailed_description>
