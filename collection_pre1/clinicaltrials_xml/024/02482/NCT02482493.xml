	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one commonly perform orthopaedic procedure . Approximately 84,000 knee replacement procedure record UK 2012 . The main goal TKA relieve disable pain arthritic disease . Patient satisfaction follow TKA related quick recovery return daily activity . This dependent design implant use knee . Improvements implant design surgical technique mean many modern design offer implant survival rate beyond 10 - 15 year . As cost pressure increase NHS unit cost implant scrutinise , particularly regard cost effectiveness . The Press-Fit Condylar ( PFC ) Sigma implant use either conventional metal back alternatively polyethylene tibial component ( part fit shin bone ) , latter considerably cheap manufacture . Four small prospective randomise trial one large regional registry study long follow support safe use polyethylene tibial component TKA . The investigator therefore undertake prospective randomise control trial compare result polyethylene tibial component conventional metal back tibial component patient age 75 , compare clinical outcome radiological survivorship . The type knee replacement use patient ( metal-backed polyethylene ) chosen random patient agree take part study . Data collect mean follow-up appointment questionnaires clinical test operation 1 year , 2 year 5 year postoperatively . This allow u see types knee replacement perform time one perform good term patient movement , pain functional activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary design methodology . When patient appropriate study add wait list Total Knee replacement give ( miss , post ) information sheet study . This allow patient several week read information telephone Orthopaedic research department , wish , question may . The Patients come preassessment clinic usual . At point study explain person , patient give time ask question ask wish consent participate . If patient consent take part complete preoperative measure questionnaires There 3 questionnaire patient functioning . 2 complete patient 1 help Researcher The questionnaire : Oxford Knee Score American Knee Society Score ( AKSS ) Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey ( MOS SF-36 ) All questionnaires perform preoperatively , 1 year , 2 year 5 year postoperatively . Six week postoperatively patient attend follow-up clinic . This standard patient undergoing knee replacement surgery Tunbridge Wells Hospital . Routine wound check postoperative care take place patient 's concern dealt . At point patient book another routine follow appointment 3 month postoperatively . No study data collect visit besides adverse event lose follow-up appropriate . At one year post-operatively patient ask attend appointment . The knee assess clinical series clinician patient questionnaire complete . A series x-ray also take allow position implant record . Measurements take take x-rays Similarly patient invite attend 2 appointment 2 year 5 year post-operatively . At appointment questionnaire repeat along x-ray . Should patient wish withdraw point free contact subsequent appointment unless due routine clinical appointment . Any patient undergoing total knee replacement study attend routine 6 week 3 month one year follow-up appointment , routine discharge appropriate subject long term follow-up .</detailed_description>
