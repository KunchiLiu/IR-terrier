	<brief_summary>Adoptive T cell therapy tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) achieve impressive clinical result durable complete response patient metastatic melanoma . The TILs isolate patient tumor tissue follow vitro expansion activation around 4-6 week . Before TIL infusion patient receive 1 week precondition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine . After TIL infusion Interleukin-2 administer support T cell acitivation proliferation vivo . Recent study suggest , TIL therapy work cancer Metastatic Melanoma , include Ovarian Cancer . In study TIL therapy administer patient metastatic Ovarian Cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adoptive T cell therapy tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) achieve impressive clinical result durable complete response patient metastatic melanoma . The TILs isolate patient tumor tissue follow vitro expansion activation around 4-6 week . Before TIL infusion patient receive 1 week precondition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine . After TIL infusion Interleukin-2 administer support T cell acitivation proliferation vivo . Objectives : To evaluate safety feasibility treat patient metastatic ovarian cancer ACT TILs . To evaluate treatment relate immune response To evaluate clinical efficacy Design : Patients screen physical exam , medical history , blood sample ECG . Patients undergo surgery harvest tumor material TIL production . Patients admit day -8 order undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludara start day -7 . On day 0 patient receive TIL infusion shortly start IL-2 infusion continually follow decrescendo regimen . The patient follow progression 5 year</detailed_description>
