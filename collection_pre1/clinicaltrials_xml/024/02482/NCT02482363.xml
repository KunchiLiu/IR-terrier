	<brief_summary>Season birth influence pregnancy reason remain unclear however answer may lie amount sunshine pregnant woman expose . Sunshine , ultraviolet light ( UV ) exposure already know benefit health heart disease , stroke depression . In pregnancy , relationship sunshine exposure evident birth weight , preterm birth risk blood pressure complication . Vitamin D , UV generate hormone , think responsible low vitamin D level associate pregnancy complication . However , vitamin D replacement ineffective preventing outcome , investigator hypothesise UV beneficial pregnancy work different pathway . A new understanding skin function central , 2014 study show expose adult 20 minute low dose UV light lower blood pressure improve blood flow . These investigator demonstrate direct effect UV skin mediate nitric oxide , chemical central many aspect pregnancy include blood pressure regulation uterine activity . The investigator study fund Tommy 's investigate similar effect see pregnancy circulation . The design similar previously successful method volunteer would recruit clinical area second trimester . As rest warm 20 minute potential similar effect circulation , control arm expose participant without UV . This pilot study would involve one visit measurement take would include heart rate , blood pressure , arteriography , ultrasound uterine artery blood measurement nitric oxide level . Arteriography perform use specialised arm cuff safe non-invasive . A subset woman would invite repeat third trimester investigate difference effect late gestation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis ultraviolet A ( UVA ) exposure pregnancy release nitric oxide ( NO ) skin turn cause blood vessel dilatation . This see change uterine artery blood flow , blood pressure , arterial stiffness ( arteriography ) . The aim investigate low risk group high risk group , 2 group woman different baseline characteristic vascular system potentially different response intervention . A subset woman invite repeat intervention third trimester pregnancy establish effect differs advance gestation . Birth outcomes participant collect check high low risk group representative status . Participant contact information keep separately collect data anonymise collect data outcome data de-identified . All collect information store secure university server password protect . Participants recruit participate low sunshine month November 1st March 1st minimise background sunshine UV exposure . LOW RISK ARM : 20 participant recruit community hospital antenatal clinic , day assessment unit , labour ward first trimester screen appointment poster , research midwife member clinical research team . Potential participant give information form ask give write consent follow sufficient time consideration . The participant 14 28 week pregnant time intervention pregnancy relate complication risk factor pre-eclampsia growth restriction . Over single morning afternoon protocol complete participant expose intervention control one 4 hour period . The intervention participant expose ultraviolet A 20minutes dermatology phototherapy cabinet . This equivalent 2 standard erythemal dos ( SED 's ) UV light exposure . On normal summer day Northern Europe general population would expect receive 30-40 SED 's . In control intervention participant expose sham irradiation undergo exposure wear loose fitting paper boiler suit UVA impenetrable prevent UVA exposure . Protective sunglass provide . On arrival Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility , participant randomize active control treatment arm first simple randomisation method ( coin toss ) member clinical research team . As group control risk factor , main important covariate age . The purpose randomisation set aid blinding ultrasound investigator arm patient , investigator affect ultrasound result . As , simple randomisation procedure coin toss research nurse arrival appropriate . One toss determine group allocation head get control exposure first tail get intervention first . This record participant information sheet unblinded analysis . The participant rest seat 30 minute comfortable clothing temperature control room 25 degree Celsius . They assign study number researcher collect pregnancy maternal characteristic . A member research team measure baseline blood pressure , skin temperature , heart rate perform arteriography . Arteriography standard collecting procedure establish tool measure stiffness aorta ( large blood vessel heart ) . An ultrasound confirm fetal viability baseline uterine artery Doppler measurement . An intravenous ( IV ) cannula insert 5ml venous blood sample collect experienced member clinical research team . The participant expose intervention UVA 20 minute either underwear ( active ) loose fitting paper boiler suit UVA impenetrable . The suit allow skin heat , expose UVA . This control temperature effect . The investigator perform ultrasound blind whether participant wear suit use research nurse investigator present irradiation . Immediately follow exposure BP , heart rate , skin temperature uterine artery Doppler 's measure 10 minutely interval 1 hour . 3 measurement collected time point BP , heart rate uterine artery Doppler . A venous blood sample collect cannula 0 , 30 60 minute time point . At 60 minute time point , arteriography repeat . Uterine artery Doppler image store study number offline analysis . The participant cross arm , investigator remain blind process repeat . HIGH RISK ARM : 20 participant 14 28 week refer direct care team base historical risk factor previous pregnancy high risk factor current pregnancy include essential hypertension , renal vascular disease , previous intrauterine growth restriction low Papp-A result first trimester screen blood test . Papp-A measure part first trimester screen produce develop placenta . Low result associate poor fetal growth pre-eclampsia . Their direct care team community hospital antenatal clinic , day assessment unit ultrasound department may identify potential participant refer research team interest participate . This include midwives , doctor ultrasound staff . A poster mechanism self referral present care area antenatal clinic ultrasound department . If give consent , recruit participate . If concern fetal maternal well exclude trial . They undergo protocol include randomisation . LONGITUDINAL ARM : All participant invite return undergo trial protocol third trimester time point within 3 month window trial run . The investigator would aim collect 10 low risk group 10 high risk group . Participants whose third trimester commences outside window eligible longitudinal group . FOR ALL GROUPS : The consent include permission collect birth outcome deliver . Outcomes interest pregnancy outcome ( stillbirth , live birth ) , birth weight , gestational length , incidence pre-eclampsia pregnancy induce hypertension . This retrieve medical record use post hoc subgroup analysis ass difference response UVA exposure . The study conclude last baby deliver birth data collect . Results record anonymised way study number , anonymised data store separately participant data . After last pregnancy deliver , data completely de-identified . Blood sample store Edinburgh Reproductive Tissue Biobank participant consent .</detailed_description>
