In addition , several meeting researcher health care professional hold pre-intervention , intervention . The researcher also arrange meeting give health care professional various setting chance meet share experience relate deliver intervention . Both patient family caregiver include study . The inclusion criterion patient : receipt palliative care , limited life expectancy nevertheless assume &gt; 5 week . Patients include active data collection , ask consent use specific information medical record , include diagnosis illness duration . Patients also ask approval preference family caregiver ( ) ask participate study . The inclusion criterion family caregiver : ≥18 year old , able understand speak Swedish .

Inclusion baseline assessment complete March 2014 end intervention delivery April 2014 . The 2-month follow-up assessment participant complete June 2014 . The long-term assessment may extend since time dependent time death patient . All data collection , however , finalize December 2015 . Data collect family caregiver , patient health care professional order evaluate intervention influence well intervention delivery To determine effect intervention , participant assessment make four time point : randomization ( i.e . baseline ) , upon completion intervention , 2 month intervention 6 month patient 's death The questionnaire include background characteristic age , sex , living condition , level education , relationship patient , marital status , financial situation , morbidity , health care need .

A sample 110 would sufficiently large detect medium effect size . Descriptive statistic , χ2 statistic categorical variable , Student 's t-test ( unpaired ) continuous data ( equivalent non-parametric test ) use describe characteristic participant compare intervention control group baseline . Due violation assumption independence multiple linear regression analysis base robust variance estimate conduct test short longer-term effect intervention ( baseline , upon completion intervention two month follow intervention ) 6 month patient 's death .

For reason , write oral information emphasize voluntary nature participation right withdraw study time point . Ethics approval project extend project obtain regional ethical review board Stockholm ( 2012/377-31 , 2012/2191-32 , 2013/934-32 ) . Significance clinical relevance The Project base RCT design contribute high evidence value result .
