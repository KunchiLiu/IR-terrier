	<detailed_description>Protocol : Informed consent obtain document . Subjects agree participate intravenous line least 16 gauge place anesthesiologist via standard sterile technique , lidocaine use patient comfort procedure . The intravenous line contain two stopcock connect intravenous fluid order obstetrician anesthesiologist patient care . If reason intravenous line use blood draw , second intravenous line place purpose draw blood sample . This line place anesthesiologist us lidocaine operate standard sterile condition . This line connect fluid , device short piece tube use commonly purpose ( often call `` heplock , '' although heparin use ) ; two stopcock attach end device . Blood sample draw intravenous line ( `` heplock '' becomes necessary place one ) use following procedure : 10 mL sterile syringe attach distal stopcock 5 mL blood withdrawn ( clear line intravenous fluid ) . A second 10 mL sterile syringe attach proximal stopcock 5 mL blood withdrawn assay ( total 10 mL blood withdrawn ) . The blood withdrawn clear line waste . Finally , 5 mL normal saline flush administer clear line blood . Blood drawn baseline ( placement intravenous catheter ) , immediately delivery placenta ( within 15 minute ) , 1 hour postpartum ( within 1 hour 1 hour 15 minute ) , 4 hour postpartum ( within 4 hour 4 hour 15 minute ) , 24-36 hour postpartum ( 5 sample total per subject ) . After last blood draw , intravenous line discontinue clinically indicate . Blood place standard `` yellow top '' tube send University 's flow cytometry lab centrifuge undergo flow cytometry measure microparticles stain identify endothelial- , platelet- versus leukocyte-derived microparticles determine placental origin . In addition Tissue Factor level microparticles measure . Also , confirmatory image stream microscopy perform . Data acquisition perform ImageStreamX validation Gallios Cytometer . Demographic data collect include age , height , weight , American Society Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification , gravidity , parity , estimate gestational age , co-existing maternal obstetric condition . Note make date time blood draw , date time delivery baby placenta . Estimated blood loss record , blood product transfusion . Sample size : As pilot data , convenience sample 10 patient study . Statistics : Demographic data present primarily descriptive statistic . Comparisons make assay result among various time point ( i.e. , baseline value compare value subsequent time ) . Tests normality perform ; mean standard deviation report normal data median interquartile range non-normal data . Assay result various time point compare mixed-model analysis variance . A P &lt; 0.05 require reject null hypothesis .</detailed_description>
