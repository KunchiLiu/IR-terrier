	<brief_summary>The investigator design phase 2 , open label , randomize trial Tamoxifen ( 20 mg/day ) Letrozole ( 2.5 mg ) treatment squamous carcinoma cervix . Forty four patient recurrent persistent disease recruit , randomize , treat follow three-monthly 12 month . The primary end point treatment response rate . Secondary end point include survival , ECOG performance status , quality life efficacy biomarkers predict response . Candidate biomarkers include ER , PR , GPER HPV genotype paraffin cancer tissue well methylated gene blood studied relation therapeutic outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although human papillomavirus ( HPV ) necessary cause cervical cancer , HPV infection inefficient insufficient cause cancer . New evidence suggest endogenous exogenous sex hormone confer risk develop cervical cancer . In unscreened population , incidence cervical cancer start menarche constantly increase menopause , incidence flatten decline [ 21 ] . Indeed , menopause , newly incident CIN3 seldom detect [ 22 ] . Large-scale epidemiological study also show high number full-term pregnancy [ 23 ] ( rather abortion ) long-term use hormonal contraceptive [ 24 ] independent risk factor cervical cancer . These evidence point female sex hormone another culprit cervical cancer . The role estrogen ERα HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis best demonstrate pK14-HPV E6/E7transgenic mouse , without estrogen exposure , develop benign skin tumor . However , mice treat exogenous estradiol physiological level , develop cervical cancer nearly 100 % efficiency [ 25-28 ] . These cervical neoplasia recapitulate characteristic human cervical cancer aspect : originate squamous-columnar junction , early lesion atypical squamous metaplasia , CIN invasive squamous cell carcinoma [ 29 ] . Most importantly , removal exogenous estrogen castration mouse lead diminish progression partial regression pre-existing neoplasia [ 30 ] . The investigator design open , randomize , multi-center trial tamoxifen letrozole treatment recurrent persistent squamous cell carcinoma cervix . Patients recurrent persistent SCC cervix amenable cytotoxic treatment randomize block participate center one two arm . The block size two . Medication give orally daily dose tamoxifen ( Nolvadex ) 20 mg , letrozole ( Femara ) 2.5 mg disease progression end study . Primary end point study response rate ( complete response partial response rate ) tamoxifen letrozole arm . Secondary end point include progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) compare historical result , ECOG Performance Status , quality life outcome predictor ( biomarkers clinical characteristic ) responsiveness survival . The experienced survival data participate center compare .</detailed_description>
