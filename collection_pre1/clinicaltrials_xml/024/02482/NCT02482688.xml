	<detailed_description>Stroke one major cause death worldwide , second coronary disease , lead cause disability patient need long hospitalisation long-term community care ( Mackay , Mensah , Mendin , &amp; Greenlund , 2004 ) . Stroke patient perceptual cognitive impairment unilateral neglect particular concern among bad prognostic outcome ( Di Monaco et al. , 2011 ; Narasimhalu et al. , 2011 ) . Unilateral neglect , commonly observe brain damage right posterior parietal cortex , often associate reduced awareness visual auditory stimulus present contralesional ( leave ) side space ( Humphreys &amp; Riddoch , 2001 ) , particularly presence compete stimuli ipsilesional ( right ) side ( i.e. , extinction ) ( Humphreys , Romani , Olson , Riddoch , &amp; Duncan , 1994 ) . This manifest failure cancel line one side page ( 'neglect ' ) . In milder case patient detect single stimulus contralesional side fail detect item another item present simultaneously ipsilesional side ( 'extinction ' ) . Currently consensus optimal training strategy alleviate neglect extinction , therefore , remain important attempt develop new procedure effective medium long-term , generalise outside clinic clinically applicable . Multisensory integration potentially important vehicle neurorehabilitation know generate large facilitative effect information processing across wide range individual . For example , motor reaction time ( RTs ) significantly faster ( Barutchu , Crewther , &amp; Crewther , 2009 ; Barutchu , Freestone , Innes-Brown , Crewther , &amp; Crewther , 2013 ) , perceptual sensitivity ( Stein , London , Wilkinson , &amp; Price , 1996 ) , work memory learning ( e.g. , Shams &amp; Seitz , 2008 ) , enhance response spatially temporally synchronous multisensory stimulus compare stimuli present single sensory modality . In addition , multisensory integration use compensate unisensory decline elderly restore motor function level generally observe young adult ( e.g. , Laurienti , Burdette , Maldjian , &amp; Wallace , 2006 ) . Critically , recent evidence suggest stroke patient general may benefit early post-stroke rehabilitation ( Bai et al. , 2012 ) , stroke patient heminopia benefit multisensory integration ( e.g. , Passamonti , Bertini , &amp; Ladavas , 2009 ) . These study also demonstrate multisensory rehabilitation strategy long last effect 1 year initial training , improvement generalize daily activity , reading . However , unknown whether finding generalize type perceptual cognitive impairment . This study first investigate combine long-term effect multisensory signal establish effective intervene acute chronic stage disorder . The aim project develop novel approach remediation neglect extinction compare multisensory integration unisensory integration , determine whether best intervene acute chronic stage disorder . In addition , project investigate neural underpin functional recovery neglect patient , use fMRI . The specific aim research project : - To assess perception improve stroke patient unilateral neglect/extinction result multi- uni-sensory integration , well train effect generalize task longevity rehabilitation deliver acute stage vs. chronic stage disorder . - To evaluate , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , adaptive change plasticity brain network follow multisensory learn patient neglect/extinction , understand gain neural mechanism link functional recovery neglect/extinction patient . Description rehabilitation A randomise control design , compare individual receive visual unisensory stimulation alone ( i.e. , control rehabilitation ) receive multisensory stimulation ( i.e. , experimental rehabilitation ) , use assess effect multisensory rehabilitation learning , performance accuracy speed participant neglect/extinction . Participants neglect/extinction recruit 2 day - 2 month post stroke randomly allocate one 4 group : 2 stage post-stroke ( acute vs. chronic ) x 2 rehabilitation type ( unisensory vs. multisensory ) ( ~20 participant per group ) . Search memory task develop participant present visual stimulus ( e.g. , object - unisensory stimulation group ) visual stimulus sound ( multisensory stimulation group ) . Participants present stimuli ask detect remember object location . Participant option respond verbally press button . Task begin easy level ( e.g. , one object present time ) gradually increase difficulty participant performance improves ( e.g. , increase number object detect remember ) . All participant subject 2 week unisensory multisensory rehabilitation ( 6 session approximately every second day ) . The rate improvement across session measure order judge best training 'dose ' use future clinical setting . To gauge recovery , generalisation across cognitive process , long-term carry effect , participant assess use Birmingham Cognitive Screen ( BCoS ) Oxford Cognitive Screen ( OCS ) ( Humphreys , Bickerton , Samson , &amp; Riddoch , 2012 ) 1- 6-months post rehabilitation . The investigator also include measure functional outcome ( e.g. , Stroke Impact Scale - SIS , Nottingham Extended ADL test ) measure quality life QoL ( participant carer ) . At begin study ( screen phase ) , participant screen assess eligibility study fMRI . Participants meet eligibility criterion invite participate rehabilitation program ( study phase ) . Only participant meet inclusion criterion fMRI invite brain scan study phase rehabilitation 1-month post rehabilitation . For fMRI scan , T1 , Flair DTI record simple detection task auditory visual stimulus use measure functional activity unilateral bilateral stimulus presentation . There know potential risk study , well know contra-indication MRI participant invite brain scan , inconvenience attend nine session : one screening phase , six study phase , two follow-up session 1 month 6 month follow completion 6th session study phase .</detailed_description>
