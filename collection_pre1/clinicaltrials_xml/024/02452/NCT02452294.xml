Patient currently receive increase chronic treatment ( &gt; 5 day ) corticosteroids another immunosuppressive agent ; 1 . The following us corticosteroid permit : single dos ; e.g . standard premedication taxanes ; topical application ( e.g. , rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g. , obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g. , intraarticular ) 2 .

Participant must EIAEDs least two week prior start study 3 . Requirement 4 mg dexamethasone daily 6 . Patient treat start study treatment follow drug : 1 . Drugs know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A include herbal medication . 2 . Drugs know risk induce Torsades de Pointes 3 . Note : The patient must discontinue strong inducer least one week must discontinue strong inhibitor treatment initiate . Switching different medication prior start study treatment allow . 4 . Patient receive prior treatment PI3K inhibitor , AKT inhibitor mTOR inhibitor 5 . Patient receive antiangiogenic antiVEGF target agent 7 . Patient currently receive warfarin coumarinderivative anticoagulant treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , fondaparinux allow 8 . Patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , contraindicate patient participation clinical study ( e.g. , active uncontrolled severe infection , chronic active hepatitis , immunocompromised , acute chronic pancreatitis , uncontrolled high blood pressure , interstitial lung disease , etc . ) 9 . Patient known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ( test mandatory ) 10 . Patient follow cardiac abnormality : a. symptomatic congestive heart failure 1. history document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association NYHA functional classification IIIIV , see Appendix 6 ) , Documented cardiomyopathy 2 .

Patient impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) 12 . Participants follow mood disorder judge Investigator psychiatrist , result participant 's mood assessment questionnaire : . Patient score ≥ 12 PHQ9 questionnaire , see Appendix 7 b .

Patient history noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent 15 . Patient concurrently use approve investigational antineoplastic agent . 16 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Patients elevate hCG baseline judge related tumor eligible hCG level show expect double repeat 57 day later , pregnancy rule vaginal ultrasound 17 . Patient apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment : a. Sexually active male use condom intercourse take drug 16 week final dose study treatment father child period , may recommend seek advice conservation sperm . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . b . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study least 4 week final dose study treatment c. Highly effective contraception define either : . Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] . ii . Female sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment iii . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . [ For female study subject , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient ] iv . Use combination follow ( a+b ) : 1 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 2 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/ film/ cream/vaginal suppository . 3 . Note : Hormonal contraception method ( e.g . oral , injected , implant ) allow buparlisib decrease effectiveness hormonal contraceptive . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . For woman therapyinduced amenorrhea , oophorectomy serial measurement FSH and/or estradiol need ensure postmenopausal status . NOTE : Ovarian radiation treatment luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate ) permit induction ovarian suppression . 18 . Patient poorly control diabetes mellitus ( glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8 % ) poorly control steroidinduced diabetes mellitus ( glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8 % )</criteria>
