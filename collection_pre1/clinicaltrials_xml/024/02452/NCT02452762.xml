	<brief_title>Rapid Normalization Vitamin D Critically Ill Children : A Phase II Dose Evaluation Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Rationale : Documented role vitamin D calcium homeostasis , cardiovascular respiratory health , inflammation , innate immunity , neuromuscular function lead hypothesis deficiency might represent modifiable risk factor outcomes critical illness . In recent year , dozens adult study report high deficiency rate , association low vitamin D level organ dysfunction , health resource utilization , mortality intensive care unit ( ICU ) . More recently , similar observation make critically ill pediatric population . The cumulative body basic science clinical literature demonstrate deficiency common critical illness rapid normalization vitamin D status could improve clinical outcome and/or reduce health care cost . However , conduct phase III trial determine whether restoration vitamin D status improve outcomes PICU , appropriate dose regimen must identify . Consequently , investigator propose phase II , double blind randomize control trial determine load therapy dose regimen safely rapidly normalize vitamin D status critically ill child . Objectives : Primary Objective : Determine whether weight-based load protocol rapidly normalize blood vitamin D level critically ill child Secondary Objectives : ( 1 ) Evaluate whether weight-based loading protocol , compare usual care , result great occurrence vitamin D related adverse event ( hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria ) ; ( 2 ) determine barrier feasibility multicenter phase III randomize control trial evaluate whether rapid vitamin D normalization improve clinical outcome and/or reduce health care spending critically ill child . Eligibility Criteria : The inclusion criterion study : ( ) Admitted ICU , ( ii ) Corrected gestational age &gt; 37 week age &lt; 18 year , ( iii ) Expected ICU admission excess 48 hour expect access blood work Day 7 hospital admission , ( iv ) Blood 25 ( OH ) D le 50 nmol/L ( regardless prior approach supplementation ) . Exclusion criterion : ( ) Significant gastrointestinal disorder prevent enteral drug administration ( e.g . necrotizing enterocolitis ) ; ( ii ) Hypercalcemia ( exclude transient abnormality relate parenteral calcium administration hypocalcemia ) ; ( iii ) Confirmed suspect William 's syndrome ; ( iv ) Patient know nephrolithiasis Nephrocalcinosis ; ( v ) Imminent plan withdrawal care transfer another ICU ; ( vi ) Physician refusal ; ( vii ) Previous enrollment study ; ( viii ) Patient know granulomatous disease ( tuberculosis sarcoidosis ) , ( ix ) Severe liver dysfunction/liver failure ; ( x ) Patient know hypersensitivity allergy vitamin D non-medicinal ingredient formulation ; ( xi ) Patient thiazide diuretic also receive regular ongoing calcium supplementation daily recommend intake ( reason hypocalcemia ) ; ( xii ) Adolescent female child-bearing age positive serum pregnancy test ; ( xiii ) Patient digoxin-therapy Patients meet inclusion criterion # 1-3 exclusion criterion approach regard participation . If consent give , 25OHD determine 50 nmol/L randomize . Participants stratify age two category ( 30 day age below/equal 30 day age ) . Randomization/allocation concealment perform use web-based randomization system . Interventions : All participant may also receive standard vitamin D dosing ( e.g . 400 IU/day ) 1 . Enteral loading arm ( n=40 ) : 10000 IU/kg cholecalciferol ( max 400000 IU ) 2 . Placebo arm ( n=20 ) : For blind purpose , arm receive placebo solution Data Collection : Blood urine collect day 0 ( enrolment day ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , hospital discharge , intervention trigger know influence vitamin D status ( e.g . cardiopulmonary bypass , hospital stay &gt; 30 day ) . Information demographic , hospital course , adverse event , health resource utilization enter electronic case report form . Sample Size : Randomization 40 child load arm provide sufficient power estimate proportion achieve target 25OHD confidence interval Â±15 % . Assuming 5 % non-compliance/drop-out rate arm , randomization 60 patient ( total ) may require achieve desired power . Significance : Critical illness occur ten thousand child year North America result death , significant suffering , prolong period rehabilitation , chronic illness . High vitamin D deficiency rate PICUs recognize interaction vitamin D status health multiple organ system suggest vitamin D could represent inexpensive , safe mean improve outcome reduce health care spending . Unfortunately , approve daily dose regimen require month restore vitamin D level study load therapy pediatric critical illness . Consequently , despite significant literature suggest vitamin D deficiency modifiable risk factor , evidence inform physician true benefit risk load therapy . The propose phase II clinical trial determine provide cholecalciferol load facilitate rapid normalization vitamin D level , provide initial information toxicity .</detailed_description>
