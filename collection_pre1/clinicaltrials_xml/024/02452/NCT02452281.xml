	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see combination HSPPC-96 ipilimumab safe effective treatment advance melanoma . HSPPC-96 investigational vaccine create tissue patient 's tumor . The vaccine design capture cancer 's `` fingerprint . '' Injection vaccine may cause patient 's immune system recognize attack cell specific cancer fingerprint . Ipilimumab drug approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma boost immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Effects Vaccine ( HSPPC-96 ) Combined With Ipilimumab Patients With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label , single-center , phase I-II trial determine safety , feasibility immunogenicity combination treatment HSPPC-96 ipilimumab patient therapeutically unresectable Stage III Stage IV malignant melanoma . The main purpose study ass whether administration combination ipilimumab HSPPC-96 safe . The rationale combining two treatment resides respective role immune system describe base clinical experience collect far . HSPPC-96 able initiate tumor specific immune response ipilimumab could theoretically amplify block checkpoint naturally down-regulates T cell .</detailed_description>
