	<detailed_description>This randomize , parallel phase II study evaluate rate progression-free survival unacceptable toxicity patient receive NK cell-enriched donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLIs ) administer alone administer TLR9 agonist , DUK-CPG-001 , 7-8/8 HLA-matched related unrelated donor ( Cohort A ) 4-6/8 HLA-matched relate donor ( Cohort B ) follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Randomization stratify disease type ( myeloid versus lymphoid malignancy ) . Patient prior start therapy Prior initiating therapy , patient update history physical examination perform . Prior NK cell-enriched DLI , follow test require within 2 week consent study : CBC ( differential prefer ) , creatinine , AST , ALT , total bilirubin , calcium , LDH , potassium , pregnancy test patient female childbearing potential . Patients blood marrow store analysis immune function chimerism . Tests document patient 's disease state require study entry well ( marrow exam , blood study , and/or radiographic test CTs , MRI , PET scan determine treat physician , require standardized response evaluation outline section 4.31 reference standard response criterion ) do close initiation NK cell-enriched DLI possible . It recommend do within 1 week , however patient stable significant change disease status note treat physician , test may do 3 week initiate NK cell-enriched DLI . Other recommended test ( require helpful final analysis ) include : sodium , chloride , bicarbonate , glucose , total protein , albumin , magnesium , phosphorous , alkaline phosphatase . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy patient know abnormality marrow previous transplant test repeat check prior abnormality morphology , flow cytometry , PCR , cytogenetics . Donor apheresis cell processing Donors return center fresh collection NK cell need growth factor mobilization . One collection use NK cell infusion . Cells transfuse immediately collection process next day . Cell processing perform cryopreservation lab accord SOP collection , label handling . The cell NK select use CD56 antibody ( CliniMACS CD56 Reagent ) , CliniMACSplus instrument CliniMACS tubing set provide Miltenyi Biotec use company protocol ( Miltenyi Biotec Inc , Auburn , California ) . Pre post processing cell count , viability , Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Assay ( HPCA ) flow analysis per SOP do . Patient Evaluation 4.31 Assessment disease use standardize criterion shall include careful examination study need detect disease ( PET , radiograph , immuno phenotype , marrow , molecular study etc ) . Restaging may alter discretion transplant physician follow patient ( subinvestigators study ) patient felt progressing time point recommend restaging q3 month 1 year last NK-enriched DLI , q6 month next 2 year , indicate clinically . Toxicity formally evaluate post infusion week later ( determine treatment team ) minimum every week 6 week post infusion history ( specific GI toxicity well overall new problem ) , physical exam , CBC , liver function test ( AST , ALT , bilirubin minimum ) , Chemistry CS include creatinine BUN toxicity assessment follow NCI common toxicity criterion ( version 4 ) standard GVHD criterion ( appendix I ) . The test procedure addition excess standard allogeneic transplant outside protocol . Further follow require need patient toxicity due transplant infusion procedure . Patients grade 3 great toxicity due study see every week minimum toxicity &lt; grade 3 , see clinically appropriate . Patient NK cell infusion CpG administration plan The target cell dose NK cell-enriched DLI many cell collect less 0.5 x 106 CD3+ CD56- cells/kg patient weight 4-6/8 HLA-matched relate set 1 x 106 CD3+ CD56- cells/kg patient weight 7-8/8 HLA-matched related unrelated setting . The first NK cell-enriched DLI administer around 6-8 week ( range , 4-12 week ) post transplant . The second NK cell-enriched DLI administer 8 week ( ±4 week ) post first infusion , patient &lt; grade II aGVHD time infusion unacceptable toxicity ( see 6.2.1 Definition unacceptable toxicity ) least possibly relate previous DLI resolve grade 1 less . The second DLI NOT administer patient ≥grade III aGVHD time infusion unacceptable toxicity least possibly relate first infusion . If patient GVHD immunosuppressive therapy study entry , patient continue stable dose immunosuppressive agent start therapy acute GVHD NK cell-enriched DLI , taper least 6 week follow NK cell-enriched DLI ( unless disease progression patient toxicity agent require early taper ) . The donor NK cell infuse 30 minute . Diphenhydramine 25 mg iv po , Acetaminophen 650 mg po use prior reinfusion , unless history allergy contraindication patient , case hydrocortisone 50mg IV use . These cell infuse patient via peripheral intravenous line central line . If sign GVHD occur NK cell-enriched DLI , immunosuppressive agent ( prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus and/ mycophenolate prefer first choice ) may start .</detailed_description>
