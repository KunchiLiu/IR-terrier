	<detailed_description>ISC-hpNSC cellular therapeutic consist human parthenogenetic neural stem cell ( hpNSC ) . ISC-hpNSC inject intracerebrally striatum substantia nigra patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The study enroll 4 patient cell injection three different dos . A total 12 patient moderate severe PD treat . Each patient receive single dose . The main objective study evaluate safety cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
