	<brief_title>Observational Plan Obtain Clinical Experience Follow Data Use ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational plan design obtain clinical experience follow data use ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device fixation osteotomy reconstruction less toe follow correction procedure hammertoe , claw toe mallet toe . Collection data patient treat FDA 510k approve ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device assist Cartiva evaluation effectiveness safety ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device utilize bone fixation per specify indication . The ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device currently approve commercial distribution use country protocol administer ( FDA 510k approval K142490 ) . . Given product approve distribution use , product use within approved indication use , data collect burdensome outside standard care , determine additional regulatory requirement applicable data collection . The ProxiFuse Hammer Toe Device consist three component : implant , deployment instrumentation , bone awl . The implant comprise 2-0 suture , two Nitinol anchor PEEK Inserts , PEEK Stabilizing Body . The device deliver specifically design instrument . The method delivery allow shift PEEK Body limit amount traction require place middle phalanx device . The suture utilized device serf shift PEEK Body apply tension Nitinol anchor turn stabilizes proximal interphalangeal joint . In accordance guideline outline ISO 14155 , ICH GCP , 21 CFR Part 50 , patient must grant document informed consent authorization disclosure identifiable health information prior collection clinical data . Each patient inform procedure perform data collect . It intent use de-identified research data potential purpose product development publication marketing literature , journal , peer-reviewed medical journal . A copy sign informed consent document provide patient original maintain part patient 's clinical record . The authorization use information collect expiration . Cartiva affiliate may continue rely authorization obtain use information unless patient revokes/cancels authorization write . Confidential information share anyone outside Cartiva affiliate . Patient names identify information use report , publication , presentation . All data de-identified maintain University Rochester . Data collection occur baseline follow time point surgical procedure : 1 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month . The study last 6 month follow patient 's surgical procedure , last subject see 6 month follow visit , withdrawn . The baseline/preoperative information assessment perform subject consent enrol . All operative , discharge , rehabilitation information capture eCRFs . Any additional procedure perform operation document well . The Investigator complete foot exam subject complete PROMIS questionnaires clinical follow visit . The PROMIS data collect study compare historical AOFAS hammertoe data PROMIS database . Weight bear anteroposterior lateral x-ray treat toe ( ) take 1 6 week follow visit . The Investigator perform radiographic assessment observe presence displacement complications.. Any finding capture eCRFs . The following data capture electronic case report form ( eCRFs ) : 1 . Baseline / Preoperative Assessment 2 . Operative 3 . Follow-up Assessment 4 . Adverse Events CRFs complete treat physician designate clinical representative . Every attempt make provide CRFs University Rochester complete entirety patient . Where information directly available patient , review patient 's clinical record conduct order complete much information possible CRFs . The sample size study base analysis primary endpoint . A minimum 70 patient enrolled goal least 59 patient complete 6 month visit . All variable analyze use intent-to -treat ( ITT ) data set . The ITT data set include enrolled patient receive ProxiFuse Hammer Toe device least one qualify toe . No method use impute value miss data . Adverse event summarize present number percent patient report event .</detailed_description>
