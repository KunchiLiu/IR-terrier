	<brief_title>Oncoplastic Approach Excisional Breast Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excisional breast biopsy one routine surgical intervention general surgery clinic , implement clinical diagnosis suspicious breast lesion . It diagnostic method choice especially fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNA ) , core cut needle ( trucut ) biopsy vacuum-assisted core biopsy part non-invasive approach provide sufficient diagnostic efficiency diagnosis non-palpable breast lesion . This invasive biopsy approach must selectively tailor accord nature lesion , either directly second-stage procedure , necessarily , sufficiently precise diagnosis reach practice less-invasive protocol . By definition , basic difference segmental mastectomy lumpectomy excisional breast biopsy surgical procedure remove suspicious breast tissue small amount normal tissue around pathologic diagnosis confirm . Prebiopsy localisation modality like wire-guidance radioisotope occult lesion localization ( ROLL ) proven reduce rate margin positivity initial lumpectomy breast cancer . Accomplishing excision whole 1 cm layer normal tissue around mean incision confine possible mastectomy line , whilst preserve skin 1cm far away suspicious area three-dimensional marking specimen consider general principle conventional excisional breast biopsy . In way , another ground rule would close collaboration plastic reconstructive surgery department , especially significant relative breast volume loss anticipate defect restore use volume replacement method nipple areola complex ( NAC ) threat . It imperative patient inform common risk reasonable alternative propose treatment . For patient seek additional advice NAC disturbances important keep mind tattoo art might appeal suggestion ; many consider tattoo practical complementary solution sequela reconstruction Nipple-areolar complex . On hand , vast majority case mainstay treatment entail surgical resection NAC requisite volume replacement , still debate whether surgeon place parenchymal suture approximate cut edge cavity wall . The rationale behind debate closure tissue defect direct suture approximation bring considerable heterogeneity come cosmetic parameter . Besides , many case , couple overlie skin dissection probable dimple observe skin knotting suture , modality end far target merit high degree patient satisfaction . Fortunately , surgical algorithm breast tumor refine great deal recent year rapid development key technique definition field oncoplastic surgery opinion favor parenchymal suture strengthen . Many study focus breast conserving surgery affirm cosmetic effectiveness oncologic success oncoplastic method even modify variant method reinforce videoscopic application . However , primary lumpectomy subject study mainly patient already receive diagnosis malignancy surgery . There much comprehensive work report patient without diagnosis malignancy .
