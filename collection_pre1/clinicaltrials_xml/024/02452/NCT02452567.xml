	<brief_summary>Obesity associate constellation cardiometabolic abnormality ( include insulin resistance , elevate blood pressure dyslipidemia ) risk factor diabetes cardiovascular disease . Weight loss improve cardiometabolic abnormality associate obesity . Up ~25 % lean people ( Body Mass Index [ BMI ] 18.5-24.9kg/m2 ) many cardiometabolic abnormality associate obesity refer metabolically abnormal lean ( MAL ) people . However , MAL phenotype well characterize unclear whether weight loss beneficial metabolic effect already lean people . Accordingly , goal study : 1 ) carefully phenotype MAL people 2 ) evaluate effect moderate ( 8-10 % ) diet-induced weight loss MAL people . This investigate 15 MAL ( define intrahepatic triglyceride ( IHTG ) content ≥5.6 % glycated hemoglobin ≥5.7 % , fast plasma glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dl , 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) plasma glucose concentration ≥140 mg/dl ) men woman . Only lean people BMI &gt; /= 21.0 &lt; 25.0kg/m2 ask lose weight avoid risk participant become underweight ( BMI &lt; 18.5kg/m2 ) weight loss therapy..</brief_summary>
