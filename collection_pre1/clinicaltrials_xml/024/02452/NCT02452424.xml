	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn PLX3397 pembrolizumab work together affect cancer cell . PLX3397 design target receptor CSF1 ( CSF1R ) . Pembrolizumab design block interaction receptor PD-1 molecule bind PD-1 . In study , PLX3397 pembrolizumab give together order study combine effect patient ' immune response tumor . Tumor-specific immune response show kill cancer cell and/or stop tumor grow . Part 1 study ( dose-escalation phase ) establish safe dose PLX3397 give combination pembrolizumab . Part 2 study ( expansion phase ) include evaluation efficacy combination follow tumor type : - Advanced melanoma : prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy never respond - Advanced melanoma : prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy respond later progress define irRECIST therapy - Non-small cell lung cancer - Ovarian cancer - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST ) - Squamous cell cancer head neck</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject must satisfy follow criterion consider inclusion study : Subjects histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis cancer recurrent , metastatic , persistent , relapsed refractory treatment also meet follow corresponding requirement cohort phase study enroll : Doseescalation Phase : Subjects advance solid tumor ( tumor type ) consider standardofcare treatment malignancy curative intent , either initial therapy progress prior therapy ; subject treat previously CSF1R inhibitor anti PD1/PDL1 inhibitor may enroll . Expansion Phase : Subjects advance melanoma , nonsmallcell lung cancer ( nonsquamous ; EGFR , ALK wild type ) , squamous cell carcinoma head neck , ovarian cancer , gastrointestinal stromal tumor . Subjects melanoma must histologically confirm diagnosis stage III disease amenable local therapy . Melanoma subject may receive number prior line therapy metastatic disease must measurable disease per RECISTv1.1 . Subjects melanoma receive prior treatment BRAF/MEK inhibitor acceptable candidate . Expansion cohort : Subjects must relapse refractory standard treatment . NSCLC , SCCHN , Melanoma must show primary progression antiPD1/antiPDL1 therapy . They must tumor accessible sequential biopsy ( core needle biopsy excision require ) willing provide study tumor tissue biopsy . Subjects newly obtain sample obtain ( e.g . inaccessible patient safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement Sponsor . ECOG performance status 0 1.. Adequate organ function demonstrate laboratory value . A subject meet follow criterion disqualify enter study : Disease suitable local therapy administer curative intent . Diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 28 day prior first dose study treatment . Has monoclonal antibody within 28 day first dose study treatment recover AEs due agent administer 28 day earlier . Has chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 14 day prior first dose study treatment recover AEs due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 alopecia exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start study treatment . Has receive transfusion blood product ( include platelet red blood cell [ RBC ] ) administration colony stimulate factor ( include granulocyte colonystimulating factor , granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor , recombinant erythropoietin ) within 28 day prior Day 1 . Evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy , situ cervical cancer isolate elevation prostatespecific antigen . Subjects completely treat prior malignancy evidence disease ≥ 2 year eligible . For Expansion cohort subject previously receive antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , anti‑PDL2 agent previously participate pembrolizumab clinical trial exclude , except follow tumor type Melanoma , NSCLC SCCHN ( must show primary progression antiPD1/antiPDL1 therapy ) . Radiation therapy within 14 day first dose study treatment . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy consider form systemic treatment . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has know central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Note : Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate meet follow criterion : 1 ) stable least 28 day prior first dose study treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) ; 2 ) evidence new enlarge brain metastasis ; 3 ) use steroid least 7 day prior first dose study treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis , exclude regardless clinical stability . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , external biliary shunt , significant small bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . QT interval correct use Fridericia 's formula ( QTc ) ≥ 450 msec ( male ) ≥ 470 msec ( female ) Screening . Congenital long QT syndrome patient take concomitant medication know prolong QT interval . Major surgery within 28 day prior first dose study treatment . Has receive live vaccine administer within 30 day prior first dose study treatment . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Active clinically significant bacterial , fungal viral infection , include hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome related illness ( HIV test require ) , include subject active infection require systemic therapy . Any follow within 48 week ( ~1 year ) prior first dose study treatment : myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start screen visit 120 day last dose study treatment . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Has prior exposure PLX3397 .</criteria>
