Antibody-drug conjugate , lorvotuzumab mertansine , create attach antibody ( protein use body 's immune system fight foreign diseased cell ) anti-cancer drug . The antibody use recognize tumor cell anti-cancer drug kill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lorvotuzumab Mertansine Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Wilms Tumor , Rhabdomyosarcoma , Neuroblastoma , Pleuropulmonary Blastoma , Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor , Synovial Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy IMGN901 ( lorvotuzumab mertansine ) Wilms tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastoma cluster differentiation ( CD ) 56-expressing tumor pleuropulmonary blastoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) synovial sarcoma . II . To determine tolerability adult recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) IMGN901 administer intravenous infusion , administer day 1 8 21-day cycle , child refractory Wilms tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastoma , pleuropulmonary blastoma , MPNST , synovial sarcoma . III . To define describe toxicity IMGN901 administer schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate tumor response tumor CD56+ expression . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics IMGN901 child refractory cancer , include assessment impact circulate CD56+ peripheral blood cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive lorvotuzumab mertansine intravenously ( IV ) 1-1.5 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
