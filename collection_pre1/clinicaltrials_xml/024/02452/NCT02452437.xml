	<brief_summary>To measure oxycodone 's intradialytic mass transfer rate coefficient oxycodone 's removal rate use ODE/PDE hemodialysis model . To implement rational clinical strategy estimate patient 's post-hemodialysis oxycodone restoration dose use result ODE/PDE model hemodialysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical Trial Simulation Design Investigational Plan : Our study sample consist group 10 randomly select virtual Caucasian hemodialysis patient Stage 5 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) group 10 randomly select Caucasian age weight match healthy control . Patients , 5 woman 5 men group , synthesize use clinical trial simulation technique case report data report Lee , Leng , Cooper experiment Kirvela coworkers . Our goal learn population study sample draw . To meet goal , investigator perform Monte Carlo simulation . Both virtual control subject experimental hemodialysis patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study two phase . In phase 1 , subject receive ceiling dose controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride ( hereafter CR-OC ) total 40 mg twice daily 2 week prior experimental hemodialysis procedure day 15 . Because patient hemodialysis group anuric , undergo hemodialysis three time weekly.10 During time , receive supplemental oral immediate-release oxycodone every 4 h need control pain visual analog scale level &lt; 3 . These pain level would correspond plasma oxycodone concentration 20-50 ng/mL . Patients instruct take last dose CR-OC 2 3 hour start experimental hemodialysis procedure . This dose schedule ensure time CR-OC 's maximum concentration ( Tmax ) maximum concentration ( Cmax ) reach time blood sample = 0 , enable accurate assessment CR-OC 's elimination negligible influence absorption redistribution . At 8:00 15th day , phase 2 study , individual undergo hemodialysis 4 hour . Two independent simultaneous blood sample measurement plasma oxycodone concentration arterial inflow ( Cin ) venous outflow ( Cout ) sit obtain immediately upon start hemodialysis ( = 0 ) immediately hemodialysis shut machine ( = 4 ) . For calculation ODE/PDE modeling ( see Model Diagram ) , oxycodone concentration sample combine average . Oxycodone 's intradialytic extraction ratio calculate simultaneously sample arterial ( inflow ) venous ( outflow ) plasma oxycodone concentration divide difference arterial plasma oxycodone concentration . Controls eat three light meal bedtime snack daily . Hemodialysis patient eat standard renal diet . Foods free know inhibitor CYP2D6 . Individuals digitally abstain nicotine , caffeine , grapefruit juice alcohol course study .</detailed_description>
