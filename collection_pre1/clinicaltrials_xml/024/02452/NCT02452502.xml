	<brief_summary>Emerging study show statin treatment pleiotropic non-cholesterol-dependent effect set ischemic stroke . Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) proven effective pharmaceutical treatment hyper-acute management ischemic stroke , spite deleterious side-effects hemorrhagic transformation reperfusion injury . These harmful impact counteract proper neuro-protective therapy . In fact , simultaneous use effective neuro-protective agent prove reduce comorbid vascular injury rt-PA . In experimental research , high dose atorvastatin combine rt-PA significantly reduce infarct volume improve neurologic deficit . Previous study show few 40 % ischemic stroke patient establish early reperfusion intravenous thrombolysis , high dose atorvastatin reveal favor maintenance cerebral vascular patency integrity , likely reduce thrombosis secondary rt-PA administration . Moreover , suggest statin sufficiently improve restoration remodel neurovascular unit cerebral cortex . Investigators thus design study prospectively investigate whether high dose atorvastatin prescribe within 24 hour IV-thrombolysis synergic effect improve neurological outcome acute ischemic stroke patient . Moreover , investigator deem necessary non-invasively monitor neuronal vascular morphological change brain indication functional improvement . In investigation center , investigator develop implement novel multimodality MR image dynamically monitor neurovascular remodeling . Therefore , worthwhile evaluate MRI measurement early prediction neurovascular reorganization long term functional recovery thrombolytic stroke patient administrate high dose atorvastatin . The primary target study prospectively investigate whether high dose atorvastatin ( 80mg ) administrate within 24 hour IV-thrombolysis synergic effect improve neurological outcome acute stroke patient , versus moderate dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Study High Dose Atorvastatin After Thrombolytic Treatment Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design It bi-center , randomize , open-label prospective study . Investigators enroll ischemic stroke patient receive IV-thrombolysis rt-PA. Those meet inclusion criterion randomize either high dose group ( atorvastatin 80mg ) moderate dose group ( atorvastatin 20mg ) within 24 hour IVT . The initial dose atorvastatin last least 2 week , adjust accord stroke risk stratification tolerance . All patient follow 0 , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , evaluate neurological deficit patient randomly assign perform multimodality MRI scan . Other standard secondary prevention stroke life-style guidance provide accord 2014 AHA/ASA stroke secondary prevention guideline . All patient follow stroke prevention clinic phone train investigator . Study Endpoints Primary endpoint The percentage patient mRS ( modify Rankin Score ) equivalent le 2 high dose group moderate dose group 90 day . Secondary endpoint NIHSS score 7 day , 1 month mRS 6,12 month Inflammation biomarkers 6 month Imaging outcomes include neuronal vascular morphological change indicate multi-model imaging . Safety tolerability evaluate record incidence severity adverse event , abnormal physical examination finding , abnormal laboratory value study . Especially monitor patient follow event : Hemorrhagic complication include intracranial , digestive tract . New stroke TIA Death all-cause death , stroke event cardiovascular event The patient muscle symptom myalgia , fatigue , weakness , creatinine kinase value 10 time upper limit normal , rhabdomyolysis , persistent elevation alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , ( define two consecutive measurement obtain 4 10 day apart three time upper limit normal range ) .</detailed_description>
