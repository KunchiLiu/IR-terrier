	<brief_title>Study Clinical Efficacy Safety Tosedostat MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open label , two-arm phase II study clinical activity tosedostat adult patient MDS fail prior hypomethylating agent-based therapy . Arm A define Revised International Prognostic Scoring Systems ( IPSS-R ) low , low , intermediate disease . Arm B define IPSS-R high high risk disease . The two arm separate enroll simultaneously . The dose tosedostat 120 mg day continuously 28 day treatment cycle . Patients assess disease response , average , every two cycle define protocol . If patient response define protocol two cycle , azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC IV 5 day may combine tosedostat , investigator 's discretion.The primary endpoint study evaluate safety efficacy tosedostat two group patient myelodysplastic syndrome relapse refractory intolerant azacitidine decitabine . The primary endpoint patient IPSS-R low , low intermediate disease transfusion independence primary endpoint patient high high risk disease overall survival .</detailed_description>
