	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study assess inflammatory response brain tumor central nervous system condition pediatric adult patient use ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI . Imaging feature correlate number inflammatory cell ( macrophage ) histopathology . Determining extent inflammation associate pathology central nervous system may helpful diagnostic prognostic purpose well monitor treatment response current future immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI Measure Inflammation Patients With Brain Tumors Other Conditions CNS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , establish MR image characteristic macrophage malignant brain tumor CNS condition pediatric adult population use ferumoxytol , ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide ( USPIO ) particle approve treatment iron deficiency anemia patient chronic kidney disease . The investigator correlate MR signal ferumoxytol uptake number macrophage surgical specimen histopathology . This information may potentially offer clinicians new mean risk stratification monitoring treatment efficacy .</detailed_description>
