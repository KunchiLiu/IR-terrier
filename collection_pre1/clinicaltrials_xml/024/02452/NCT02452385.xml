	<criteria>Active choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) associate AMD , evidence fluorescein angiography ( FA ) OCT . Patients either previous antiVEGF therapy prior antiVEGF therapy evidence response treatment need additional treatment . Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) BCVA 20/40 20/320 study eye ( ) . Adequate bone marrow , hepatic , renal function . Willing able provide write informed consent , comply investigational study protocol return study visit . Patients Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy ( PCV ) evidence Indocyanine Green Angiography ( ICG ) . Previous treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , external beam radiation , subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation , submacular surgery , transpupillary thermotherapy . CNV due cause AMD , include ocular histoplasmosis syndrome , angioid streak , multifocal choroiditis , choroidal rupture , pathologic myopia . Geographic atrophy involve foveal center study eye . Any retinal vascular disease retinal degeneration AMD study eye . Any significant disease study eye could compromise bestcorrected visual acuity . Cataract surgery study eye within three month screen . Trabeculectomy aqueous shunt valve study eye . Use investigational agent participation clinical trial investigational agent investigational therapy within thirty ( 30 ) day baseline . Females child bear potential pregnant use medically acceptable contraception ; male unwilling take adequate contraceptive measure . Serious allergy prior significant adverse reaction fluorescein . Undiagnosed acute illness first observe screen screen baseline , severe concurrent medical condition , investigator judgment , represent safety concern . Severe cardiac disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction coronary artery revascularization , arterial thrombosis within 12 month start study drug , inadequately control hypertension , ventricular tachyarrhythmias require ongoing treatment . QTc â‰¥450 msec subject history risk factor Torsades de Pointes . Stroke transient ischemic attack within 12 month trial entry . Clinically significant impair renal hepatic function . Presence active gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease condition interfere significantly absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion CM082 . Serious active infection , serious medical condition condition would impair ability subject administer investigational drug adhere study protocol requirement . Presence condition , judgment investigator , would prevent subject complete study . Need take medicine strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 .</criteria>
