	<brief_title>The Norwegian Family Centered Care Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two Norwegian neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) participate study ; Haukeland University Hospital ( HUH ) Vestre Viken Hospital Trust ( VVHT ) . The NICU HUH build around 1980 traditional unit . It crowd , single room access room parent . The NICU VVHT open April 2012 unique kind Norwegian European context . A shift traditional NICU FCC unit involve physical structural change involve entire interdisciplinary team around individual family . The main difference firstly involvement parent right present together infant secondly establishment parent responsible caregiver infant , even infant hospitalize . This comprise so-called `` minimal handling '' , number medical procedure reduce strict necessity , restructure common nursing intervention . The infant give Kangaroo Mother Care ( KMC ) skin-to-skin rather incubator . The first question raise discuss whether FCC - parent present Single Room Care 24 hour perform KMC - affect preterm infant 's growth attainment breastfeeding . The second question raise discussed whether surroundings FCC-unit - parent present - affect parent ' report parental health relation psychological stress , anxiety depression , also longitudinal perspective . The purpose study evaluate possible effect two different NICU design ; traditional open bay unit limit space possibility parent continuously stay infant , novel model physically culturally optimize parent-infant interaction 24 hour day 7 day week birth discharge . Although intrigue novel asset neonatal intensive care , effect FCC child 's family 's somatic mental health , NICU staff cost care , scientifically scrutinize . There far lack valid knowledge effect FCC single room unit parent present extent offer Nordic country . A randomize control study ( RCT ) single unit would ethically methodologically impossible conduct , e.g . since impossible avoid `` contamination '' group , Cochrane review argue comparison different unit would valid method . This recommend approach follow present study , challenge minimize factor may act confounders . To minimize confound follow detail design adhere : - Recruitment comparable infant - parent dyads - Strict definition independent outcome variable , e.g.nutrition - Prospective registration : Parental presence duration KMC , infant nutrition , growth , investigation occurrence morbidity prospectively similarly registered hospital stay supervision designate research nurse . All data growth transfer z-scores base standardized growth chart Norwegian infant pre post term growth . Relevant statistical method comparison apply statistical method choose cooperation biostatistician . The main outcome weight 34 week 40 week post menstrual age ( PMA ) , basically calculate z-score increment 34 40 week . Judged pilot study actually sufficient ten child group detect difference weight 100 gram 34 Gestational age ( GA ) week power 80 % significance level less 0.05 . However , due variable analyzes ( among mixed model ) appropriate 100 infant , 50 group . An important secondary outcome length stay term PMA discharge . From data HUH difference PMA discharge 5 day ( consider clinically relevant ) require 42 infant leg ( calculated standard deviation 13 day , power 80 % p &lt; 0.05 ) . From data one year recruitment sufficient , experience , 90 % agree participate . We consider expand inclusion 1 Â½ year ( 75 infant branch ) allow power ass effect explanatory variable . Parents agree participate register database containing name , personal identification number , code number corresponds file , information relate date questionnaire send receive , whether reminder send . No information store database . The data store respective Research server VVHT HUH accord requirement hospital Regional Committees Medical Health Research Ethics ( de-identified study file file key study file ) . Transfer data HUH VVHF perform encrypted file accord requirement . All participant ask sign inform consent form enrolment study .</detailed_description>
