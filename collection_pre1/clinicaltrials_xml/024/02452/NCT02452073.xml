	<brief_summary>Radiation enteritis ( RE ) simple definition inflammatory process occur level intestine response abdominal pelvic radiation energy exposure . Due dosage radiation , sensitivity organ radiation , patient characteristic , RE present either acute chronic syndrome . Clinical manifestation differ may include abdominal pain , malabsorption , diarrhea , cachexia , intestinal bleeding , obstruction , even perforation , compromise quality life . For many year , radiotherapy abdominal pelvic region commonly use significant percentage patient rectosigmoid genitourinary system tumor . Different technique develop prevent occurrence radiation induce injury . However , incidence CRE expect continue rise come year . What 's , abdominal pelvic radiotherapy also lead side effect addition RE , skin desquamation , local soft tissue injury , . Till , lots attention pay local complication , little report systemic damage abdominal pelvic radiotherapy . Low triiodothyronine syndrome ( LT3S ) , condition characterize low circulate triiodothyronine ( T3 ) level , normal thyroxine ( T4 ) , free thyroxine ( FT4 ) thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) level absence intrinsic thyroid disease , variously know `` nonthyroidal illness syndrome ( NTIS ) '' . This condition frequently detect critical illness . Reichlin et al . first noticed aspect thyroid hormone metabolism might change many chronic illness early 1973 . Data show 35-70 % acute chronic critical condition associate significant abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism , LT3S common type . Furthermore , change show associated disease severity connect poor short-term prognosis . To date , lots literature include detailed report relationship LT3S chronic illness rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , sepsis , . However , systematic analysis LT3S patient CRE undertaken . As , present study aim investigate frequency LT3S CRE patient .</brief_summary>
