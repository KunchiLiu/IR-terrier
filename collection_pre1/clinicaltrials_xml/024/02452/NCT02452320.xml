	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine administration acetaminophen give intravenously ( IV ) begin surgery 3 additional dos first 24 hour post-operatively reduce length time subject undergo elective sleeve gastrectomy spend hospital following operation . Additional question may answer include whether administration study medication lead improvement pain control , reduction post-operative nausea vomiting , overall improvement quality recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Morbid obesity define body mass index ( BMI : weight [ kg ] / height [ ] 2 ) ≥ 40 ≥ 35 associated comorbidities , widely prevalent , nationally globally . Overweight obese individual increase morbidity mortality . Among many available treatment option , surgical management obesity show reliably effective achieving sustain weight loss improvement glycemic , lipidemic , blood pressure control , improve five ten year survival contrast match control surgery . Various surgical approach use provide long-term control morbid obesity associate comorbidities , include laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . During sleeve gastrectomy great curvature stomach separate less curvature antrum , thereby eliminate ~85 % total stomach , include grehlin-producing portion stomach . A common complication procedure postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , occur nearly 80 % patient undergoing procedure . Risk factor PONV include : female sex , history PONV motion sickness , nonsmoking , young age , general vs. regional anesthesia , use volatile anesthetic nitrous oxide , administration postoperative opioids , duration anesthesia , type surgery ( include cholecystectomy , laparoscopic , gynecological ) . At individual level , PONV adversely impact patient satisfaction quality life score . At system level , PONV associate increased length stay ( LOS ) post-anesthesia care unit hospital , result increase cost . Both pharmacological surgical approach study effort reduce incidence PONV sleeve gastrectomy patient . Omentopexy unsuccessful , pharmacologic prophylaxis two [ dexamethasone + odansetron ; dexamethasone + granisetron ; aprepitant + odansetron ; three ( dexamethasone + odansetron + haloperidol ; antiemetic agent effective single agent ( odansetron granisetron ) alone decrease nausea vomiting . Even triple therapy , 50 % patient nauseous 20 % vomit within first 36 hour follow surgery , hospital LOS unaffected . Thus , press need improve control PONV sleeve gastrectomy patient . Acetaminophen ( N- ( 4-hydroxyphenyl ) acetamide ; paracetamol ) mild analgesic whose main , sole , mechanism action think arise inhibition cyclooxygenase pathway ; intravenous ( iv ) formulation ( acetaminophen iv ; ACP-iv ) receive US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval November 2010 available Europe since 2002 . It approve FDA management mild moderate pain single agent management moderate severe pain adjunctive opioid analgesic . Recently , two meta-analyses evaluate use ACP-iv postoperative period efficacy prevent postoperative pain [ 45 ] reduce PONV [ 46 ] . In study De Oliveria et al. , ACP-iv administration find significantly reduce postoperative pain , opioid consumption , PONV . Similarly , study Apfel colleague indicate iv-ACP , administer prophylactically , reduce PONV consequence improve pain control . With direct relevance sleeve gastrectomy patient , retrospective analysis patient undergo bariatric surgery ( sleeve gastrectomy laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ) find ACP-iv administration reduce opiate consumption hospital LOS . The investigator hypothesize administration ACP-iv perioperative period reduce hospital LOS sleeve gastrectomy subject associate reduction hospital cost . The secondary hypothesis administration ACP-iv reduce PONV improve subject satisfaction score subject population .</detailed_description>
