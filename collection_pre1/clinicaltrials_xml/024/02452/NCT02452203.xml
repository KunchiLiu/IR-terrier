	<detailed_description>The human brain constantly bombard sensory information external world . This series study aim explore effect reduce environmental stimulation use specially design floatation pool minimize visual , auditory , tactile , proprioceptive , thermal input brain . Previous research show `` float '' unique set significantly reduce level anxiety , stress , blood pressure , cortisol , significantly increase level subjective physiological form relaxation . Much past research contain various methodological weakness , include small sample size , lack control group , longitudinal follow-up . Moreover , little know potential benefit float clinical population , essentially nothing known effect float brain . The study propose protocol aim explore float 's potentially salubrious effect autonomic nervous system , begin investigate largely unknown effect central nervous system . We attempt improve upon weakness past research use large sample size , control group , longitudinal design . The current project focus document subjective , behavioral , physiological neural effect float healthy anxious population . The subjective effect float examine use self-report measure experience sample method . The behavioral effect float examine use measure interoceptive awareness distress tolerance . The physiological effect float examine use waterproof wireless track blood pressure , heart rate , respiration , movement , addition collect measure cortisol magnesium . A portable electroencephalography ( EEG ) system use measure sleep night float experience . The neural effect float examine use waterproof wireless EEG collect float experience , well use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) collect immediately float . Using longitudinal within-subject design , unique opportunity ass functional brain change , also structural brain change induce repeated exposure float . An active control condition aim control effect simple relaxation collect measure participant lay supine zero-gravity chair situate quiet , dimly lit room . This program research constitute first systematic investigation float body brain , finding potential illuminate physiological neural correlate deep relaxation induce float experience .</detailed_description>
