	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective observational study ass potential clinical effect adjunctive verteporfin photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) persistent disease activity among patient neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( NV AMD ) . No specific intervention occur part study ; participate subject undergo PDT part standard-of-care ask consent prospective collection data medical record five year date consent , include result ophthalmologic exam , image , treatment . The primary study outcome percentage subject resolution persistent disease activity six month post-PDT treatment . Aside small risk loss confidentiality , risk associate study great related standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NV AMD remain leading cause vision loss among people 65 . Intravitreal injection drug block vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , major protein mediator angiogenesis vascular leakage , revolutionize treatment NV AMD . However , less 40 % treated patient clinically significant improvement vision . Further , spite continuous monthly anti-VEGF therapy , 40-50 % patient demonstrate persistent disease activity ( PDA ) , define ( 1 ) unresolved intraretinal , subretinal , sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid ; ( 2 ) progressive lesion enlargement fibrosis ; and/or ( 3 ) persistent new hemorrhage , assess either load dose therapy sustain treatment anti-VEGF . Since affected patient increase risk long-term vision loss , PDA remain vital clinical unmet need . Verteporfin PDT ( Visudyne® , Bausch+Lomb ) approve 10 year ago FDA treatment NV AMD , prior advent anti-VEGF therapy . As monotherapy , PDT much less effective anti-VEGF therapy improve vision NV AMD patient . Furthermore , general , PDT combination anti-VEGF therapy offer benefit anti-VEGF therapy alone , assess among previously treatment-naïve NV AMD patient . However , unknown whether adjunctive PDT may effective treatment PDA . The investigator perform several retrospective study PDA adjunctive PDT among NV AMD patient Duke Medical Retina practice . Preliminary result indicate moderate severe PDA occur 40 % NV AMD patient , adjunctive verteporfin PDT may effective improve PDA vision affect patient . The present study assess potential clinical benefit adjunctive PDT NV AMD patient PDA spite anti-VEGF therapy prospective observational clinical case series .</detailed_description>
