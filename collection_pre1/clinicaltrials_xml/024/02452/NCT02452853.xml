	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cancer third frequent cause cancer death worldwide . Hepatic resection ( HR ) conventional `` curative '' treatment HCC . In European United States Proposed Guidelines HCC , HR recommend patient preserve liver function early stage HCC . Unfortunately , tumor multifocality , portal vein invasion , underlie advanced cirrhosis , 10 % 30 % HCCs amenable `` curative '' treatment time diagnosis . Transarterialchemoembolization ( TACE ) become popular palliative treatment patient unresectable HCC , longer consider contraindication HCC portal vein tumor thrombus ( PVTT ) . Unfortunately , long-term outcome generally poor HCC treat TACE , especially HCC PVTT . To improve result treatment HCC PVTT , attempt make perform HR patient . HCC PVTT remain contraindication liver transplantation high rate tumor recurrence , severe shortage donor organ . HR remain therapeutic option may still offer chance cure . With advance surgical technique , become feasible remove gross tumor , include PVTT , extend main portal vein , safely surgery . More HCC PVTT , previously consider unresectable , become resectable.Recent study even show favorable long-term survival outcome HR well-selected case HCC PVTT . However , recurrence rate HR PVTT still high prognosis patient HCC PVTT poor . Systemic chemotherapy consider one main treatment malignant tumor . HCC know highly refractory conventional systemic chemotherapy heterogeneity multiple etiology . Before advent molecular-targeted agent sorafenib , subsequently become standard care , standard systemic drug treatment regimen show obvious survival benefit HCC . Nowadays , systemic chemotherapy regimen definitively recommend standard treating HCC . Clinical activity several regimen contain oxaliplatin ( OXA ) advance HCC demonstrate phase II study . In phase II study FOLFOX4 ( infusional fluorouracil [ FU ] , leucovorin [ LV ] , OXA ) regimen Chinese patient HCC , median overall survival ( OS ) 12.4 month , mean time progression 2.0 month , response rate ( RR ) 18.2 % . The safety profile acceptable . Recently , result phase Ⅲ randomize study show FOLFOX4 serve palliative chemotherapy induce high overall survival , progression-free survival response rate compare doxorubicin patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma Asia . The safety data also acceptable.So investigator ' hypothesis post-surgery FOLFOX4 reduce high recurrence rate HR HCC PVTT . The aim open-label , single prospective study evaluate efficacy safety HR combine FOLFOX4 systemic chemotherapy patient HCC PVTT .</brief_summary>
