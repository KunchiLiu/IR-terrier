	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well nintedanib work compare placebo treat radiation-induced pneumonitis ( inflammation lung ) patient non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery undergo chemoradiation therapy . Nintedanib may help shrink slow growth radiation-induced pneumonitis block enzyme need cell grow may prevent growth new blood vessel . It may also help reduce recurrence non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nintedanib Compared With Placebo Treating Against Radiation-Induced Pneumonitis Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery Are Undergoing Chemoradiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare rate symptomatic radiation pneumonitis patient unresectable Stage II/III/ oligometastatic IV non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) complete chemoradiation follow nintedanib versus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare quality life ( QOL ) patient receive nintedanib versus placebo active treatment 6 month completion treatment . II . To compare progression-free survival , overall survival 1-year progression-free survival rate patient receive nintedanib versus placebo . III . To compare pulmonary function test ( PFT ) result radiation pneumonitis ( RP ) score patient receive nintedanib versus placebo . IV . To compare composite index ( base PFT , RP score QOL ) end active treatment 6 month completion treatment patient receive nintedanib versus placebo . V. To investigate blood-based biomarkers evaluate risk develop radiation pneumonitis well efficacy nintedanib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Beginning 4-6 week completion radiation therapy , patient receive nintedanib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-30 . Treatment repeat every 30 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Beginning 4-6 week completion radiation therapy , patient receive placebo capsule PO BID day 1-30 . Treatment repeat every 30 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 76-97 day , 166-187 day , 2-2.5 year .</detailed_description>
