	<brief_summary>The study evaluate efficacy safety imipenem+cilastatin/relebactam ( MK-7655A ) versus colistimethate sodium + imipenem+cilastatin treatment imipenem-resistant bacterial infection . Infections evaluate study hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia ( HABP ) , ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia ( VABP ) , complicate intra-abdominal infection ( cIAI ) , complicate urinary tract infection ( cUTI ) .</brief_summary>
