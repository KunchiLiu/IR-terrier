	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare efficacy add 0.05 % chlorhexidine gluconate splash basin reduce bacterial growth splash basin end total joint replacement procedure . Hypothesis : The 0.05 % chlorhexidine gluconate solution reduce bacterial growth end elective total joint arthroplasty case . Null Hypothesis : There difference bacterial growth splash basin end case despite addition antimicrobial solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total joint arthroplasty hip knee procedure grow substantially number United States . Projections approach 2 million combined total hip total knee arthroplasty procedure year 2021 [ 1 , 2 ] . With incidence post-arthroplasty infection range 1-2 % primary 3-5 % revision , number case periprosthetic infection significant [ 1 , 3-7 ] . The associated economic burden project exceed $ 1.62 billion [ 2 ] . With number mind responsibility orthopaedic community reduce social economic impact devastate complication creates . While surgical procedure carry risk bacterial contamination , implant prosthetic material particularly high risk future problem due development biofilms difficulty eradicate infection . The common time inoculation implant time surgery . Whyte et al . [ 8 ] show source infection operate room personnel 98 % case 2 % time patient 's skin . The transfer contaminant occur via direct transfer hand instrument 70 % time . Knobben et al . [ 9 ] report transfer bacteria biomaterial surface rate 17 % -71 % demonstrate ability bacteria spread type material operative field . The direct contact surface patient prosthetic implant make early contamination surgery likely cause periprosthetic infection . Maathuis et al . [ 10 ] suggest least 30 % patient leave operate suite bacterial contamination . The splash basin use many year operate room place wash instrument clean debris potential re-use surgical case . This often place multiple instrument within bath washing direct contact previously use tool . Several study show evidence bacterial contamination basin [ 11-14 ] . Rates 2.17 % 74 % contamination splash basin report . In study Anto et al . [ 11 ] average 45.7 instrument place splash basin per case . The opportunity bacteria transfer surgical wound upon re-use instrument basin therefore concern . Given splash basin potential source surgical wound contamination seek eliminate bacterial colonization source addition antimicrobial solution normal sterile water bath . To compare potential intervention , prospective study compare 0.05 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) antimicrobial solution current standard sterile water control propose . This concentration CHG follow saline rinse show decrease risk infection wound irrigation without increase risk adverse effect [ 15 , 16 ] . Given expertise area total joint arthroplasty experience treat periprosthetic infection well familiarity various antimicrobial solution feel well qualify perform study . The result study could improve patient outcome potentially eliminate source infection operate room .</detailed_description>
