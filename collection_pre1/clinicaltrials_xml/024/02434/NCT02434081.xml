	<brief_title>NIvolumab COnsolidation With Standard First-line Chemotherapy Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , concomitant chemotherapy radiotherapy become first choice treatment patient stage III non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . However , least half patient NSCLC old multiple comorbidities withstand aggressive treatment , sequential chemotherapy radiotherapy often give . Currently , approximately 30 % patient alive 5 year con¬comitant therapy , 20 % sequential therapy , 10 % radiotherapy alone . These figure remain approximately addition surgery . After chemo-radiotherapy , least 30-40 % patient show local tumour progression CT scan first site relapse . Also surgery , 30 % patient fail locally first site recurrence . In addition , half patient eventually develop distant metastasis may present undetected time stag may come persistent recur local disease . It thus obvious new approach preferentially tackle local distant disease site need improve long-term survival cure rate . Dose-limiting toxicity thoracic radiotherapy include radiation pneumonitis ( RP ) . Starting two month end radiotherapy , 15 % patient develop increase dyspnoea cough , provoke mixed T-lymphocyte infiltrate lung area irradiate . RP may happen 6 month post-treatment , however three quarter RP case occur 3 month radiotherapy . Besides dose volume parameter radiotherapy , mean lung dose ( MLD ) V20 ( percentage lung receive 20 Gy ) , important risk factor develop RP inflammatory status lung therapy . The baseline inflammation , high risk RP . Inflammation lung visualize quantified measure 18F-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) lung parenchyma standard FDG-PET-CT scan obtain time stag . As relative FDG uptake lung vs. aorta use , specific calibration PET-scanner require . Attempts improve long-term survival include radiotherapy dose escalation/acceleration , new chemotherapy combination , add biological agent cancer vaccine standard regimen . At present , none demonstrate improved outcome . Improved understanding immune profile NSCLC lead immunotherapeutic strategy , include inhibitory molecule responsible abrogate anti-cancer immune response PD-1 CTLA-4 . Bristol-Myers Squibb 's nivolumab , investigational monoclonal antibody inhibit immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 express activated T cell , demonstrate positive result phase I trials previously treat patient advance NSCLC . However , rare case severe fatal pneumonitis report throughout clinical trial use anti-PD1 anti-PDL1 compound . Pre-clinical data show clear beneficial effect combine local radiotherapy anti-PD-1 . Not local tumour control increase , `` abscopal '' effect distant metastasis could observe . Radiotherapy clearly act `` situ '' tumour vaccination result induction specific anti-tumour immunity site body could result clinical anti-tumour effect combination anti-PD-1 . While role immunotherapy currently evaluate monotherapy combination chemotherapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor line treatment advance NSCLC , monotherapy early NSCLC adjuvant set well monotherapy consolidation completion definitive chemo-radiotherapy , yet assess combination radiotherapy . While anecdotal data concurrent treatment palliative setting suggest acceptable safety good tolerability combination , formal prospective assessment require embark trial compare concurrent versus sequential checkpoint inhibitor radiotherapy design . The rationale concurrent checkpoint radiotherapy resides description case unexpected immune sensitization offer combination , demonstration tumour response localize radiotherapy immune stimulation non-irradiated site - call abscopal effect . A strong rationale also provide pre-clinical model show synergistic effect approach various vitro vivo model . In summary , definite unmet need multi-disciplinary care improve prognosis patient diagnose stage III NSCLC , strong rationale support combination chemo-radiotherapy anti-PD-1 . A major theoretical concern development pneumonitis , rare toxicity radiotherapy checkpoint inhibitor . The main aim current trial proposal therefore evaluate pneumonitis rate patient treat chemotherapy radiotherapy combination concomitant sequential nivolumab treatment .</detailed_description>
