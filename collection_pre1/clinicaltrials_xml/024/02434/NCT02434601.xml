	<detailed_description>Ethical consideration This study design conduct accord guideline Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) preparation randomize control clinical trial ( Altman et al. , 2001 ) , approval Research Ethics Committee ( protocol number CEP-035 -2011- FO / UFPel ) , Faculty Dentistry , Federal University Pelotas - RS / Brazil . Study design Calculation determine sample Based literature , sample size obtain assume average annual rate failure 6 % Class V restoration perform conventional adhesive system ( PEUMANS et al. , 2005b ) , 80 % power significance level 5 % . From recommendation American Dental Association ( 2010 ) , estimate annual failure rate 12 % restoration relative isolation . For , sample 28 determined monitoring patient minimum 5 year , consider possible attrition 20 % . Recruitment selection patient The search strategy individual interested participate clinical trial conduct dissemination project display poster distribution pamphlet FO / UFPEL well basic health unit ( BHU ) locate urban area Pelotas . In addition , study collaboration student representative class association , coordinate teacher clinical activity dentists public health system , increase receptivity accession potential volunteer . All patient refer , directly seek dental care , diagnosis non-carious cervical lesion , schedule evaluation exam . Two student seventh semester , supervision responsible study , carry consultation premise FO / UFPEL . Initially , presence LCNC assess visual inspection wooden spatula aid . If , fill patient 's medical record , contain identification data , general dental history . In addition , dental chart perform use mirror , explorer , millimeter periodontal probe , clinical tweezer , cotton roll saliva sucker . From clinical examination , LCNC sort review feature . The dentin sensitivity evaluate apply air jet 3 second , distance 2-3 cm labial surface , sensitivity degree record visual analogue scale . Likewise , pulpal vitality visualize use cotton ball previously moisten gas jet cool -50 째 C. Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion receive information letter nature proposal study . After read , ask volunteer sign consent form inform participation . In second clinic session , patient underwent process adaptation oral health prevention , control , removal plaque dental calculus . Professional intervention consist scraping , smooth polish dental , use curette / periodontal file , glass / rubber cone , Robinson brush , prophylaxis paste contra angle low speed . Operator train Six candidate operator ( student seventh eighth semester FOUFPEL ) participate train process ensure standardization clinical procedure minimize variation different operator . First stage ( theoretical ) : A lecture give , last two hour , consist presentation material technique removal modification hypermineralized surface layer dentin-carious cervical lesion . It also perform routine detailed statement institute session . A manual contain material operating instruction protocol clinical procedure , make available student . Second stage ( practice ) : Students go pre-clinical activity , watch demonstration subsequently perform Class V restoration mannequin . Secondly , perform procedure volunteer , despite present LCNC restorative need , include study . Therefore , patient receive restorative treatment condition identical patient involve study , part sample . At end train calibration step , function work group delegate use performance individual student selection criterion . Were choose two operator , restorative procedure , two assistant support operator completion medical record . The student charge sterilization instrument , schedule appointment , molding , photographic record , oral hygiene orientation , periodontal treatment , among dental procedure offer patient . All mention step perform direct supervision responsible study . Preparation patient : Four week start study , patient subject sweep session , smooth polish supragingival . In addition , patient receive individualized instruction mechanical control dental biofilm , include guidance brushing technique floss . During monitoring period , also offer dental support patient involve study . Clinical Protocol Initially , prophylaxis element restore make glass rubber base slurry pumice water . Then color restoration select aid color scale ( Vitapan Classical , Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad S채ckingen , Germany ) . Local anesthesia Also , necessary . In query , patient receive restorative action three LCNC submit clinical feature compatible . Randomization technique surface layer removal modification hypermineralized applied place draw lot . The restoration initiate previous LCNC , priority need , main complaint : aesthetic , functional aspect / symptom tooth sensitivity , etc . Each patient least 3 teeth restore 3 type treatment employ . It draw lot 3 treatment individually tooth . For example , patient possess three lesion select , draw perform select tooth treatment subject treatment . If patient posse 3 lesion perform draw element 4 . We emphasize also operator hold number restorative intervention , one prepare follow protocol recommend manufacturer material , another increase etching time 30 second dentin finally third cavity restore perform cavity prophylaxis ultrasound probe apply 30 second . The remain step carry follow protocol recommend manufacturer restorative material employ . The rubber dam accomplish use lip retractor , wire retractor # 000 ( Ultrapak Cord , Ultradent , South Jordam , UT , USA ) , cotton roll saliva sucker . The first element introduce oral cavity lip retractor , print expulsion lip cheek . Cotton roll position upper labial sulcus lower labial sulcus sublingual region , absorb saliva flow come mainly major salivary gland . The retractor wire insert gingival sulcus aid blunt spatula , without generate excessive pressure periodontium . Prior implementation restoration , type cavity preparation , bevel cavosurface margin . However , LCNC dentin surface subject various removal modification technique hypermineralized ultra-surface layer , follow : - Control Group : Restoration make follow protocol recommend manufacturer material ; - Experimental Group 1 : Increase etch time 30 second , perform phosphoric acid gel 37 % , prior application resin adhesive . The following step acid etch follow protocol recommend manufacturer material ; - Experimental Group 2 : Prophylaxis cavity ultrasound probe , apply 30 second dentin surface hypermineralized cervical lesion non-carious . Soon , restoration make follow protocol recommend manufacturer material . Both restorative procedure perform use conventional adhesive system ( Single Bond II , 3M ESPE , St. Paul , MN , USA ) composite restorative nanoparticulate ( Filtek Z350 , 3M ESPE , St. Paul , MN , USA ) , closely follow operate instruction provide manufacturer . The restoration place incremental technique use 2 3 increment restorative composite , size LCNC . The increment take adapted cavity start margin enamel spatula , brush siliconadas tip composite resin . An LED device minimum intensity 1450 mW / cm2 use polymerization . Finally , finish restoration perform use # 12 scalpel blade , diamond fine-grained multi-laminated drill , order remove excess material / improve shape contour restoration . The polish do employment siliconadas tip , floppy sandpaper ( Sof-Lex Pop-On , 3M ESPE , St. Paul , MN , USA ) , felt-specific folder polish disc . Reviews restoration Two examiner ( graduated Dentistry ) go train process calibration present intra agreement index inter-examiner least 80 % . In event disagreement assessment criterion , teri찾o get consensus direct revaluation restoration / mean digital photograph . After train phase calibration , evaluator 'blind ' , ie without involvement condition patient submit , shall proceed independently , clinical evaluation restoration . At time , evaluator use magnify glass , mirror , explorer , millimeter periodontal probe , clinical tweezer , cotton roll saliva sucker . Data relate dentin sensitivity pulp vitality also collect air jet application application cotton ball wet gas jet cool -50 째 C , respectively . Digital photograph also consult evaluator . The property evaluate sensitivity , color change integrity restoration . Statistical analysis Clinical evaluation occur follow period : 1 week ( baseline ) , six month , year , two year three year insertion restoration use evaluated criterion . The data tabulate submitted statistical analysis , consider 80 % power 5 % significance level . Will hold descriptive analysis calculation ratio characterize sample dental restoration . To compare outcomes pre- post-intervention accord treatment group also comparison outcome treatment group use chi-square test McNemar test . The analyzes perform use Stata 12.1 software .</detailed_description>
