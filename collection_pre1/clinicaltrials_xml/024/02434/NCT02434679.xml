	<brief_summary>Antibiotic resistance major public health issue multiresistant bacteria ( MRB ) increase . Among action control resistance , one interesting lead : prevent emergence resistant bacteria limit possibility bacteria acquire resistance . Mechanisms resistance gene acquisition deeply study data dynamic acquisition time . Among genetic component disseminate resistance gene , resistance integrons ( RI ) play major role acquisition dissemination antibiotic resistance gram-negative bacteria . The digestive tract newborn ( NB ) , initially sterile , colonized bacterial microbiota first day life . It thus appear appropriate model study dynamic resistance acquisition . This project intend follow NB neonatology time order study dynamic digestive acquisition RI MRB</brief_summary>
