	<brief_summary>This clinical trial inform role Low dose ketamine acute treatment severe painful sickle cell crisis child day-case sickle cell centre . The primary aim determine whether Low dose ketamine non inferior morphine management acute painful sickle cell crisis . The specific objective determine maximal change NRS pain score follow administration ketamine examine safety profile ketamine compare morphine population . The investigator hypothesize low dose ketamine result similar effective pain control morphine alone associated increase adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute pain episode associate sickle cell disease ( SCD ) difficult manage effectively . Opioid , phobia , tolerance , availability side effect major roadblock ability provide patient adequate pain relief . Ketamine cheap , widely safe , readily available drug low-middle income setting , analgesic effect sub-anesthetic dos wide range use include surgery ( opioid spar drug ) , burn ( change dress ) cancer relate pain . However literature concern use sickle cell crisis still limit set . This double-blinded , randomize control , study compare low-dose ketamine ( LDK ) morphine acute pain control child sickle cell crisis . A sample 240 child enrol population patient Sickle Cell Anemia age 7-18 present Mulago Referral Hospital Sickle Cell Clinic acute painful Vaso-occlusive Crisis ( VOC ) . To take part study , patient must pain score 7 assessment treat physician addition patient meeting study criterion . After enrollment , consent patient 's weight kg determine hold area standardize calibrate weigh scale ( SECA - From National Medical Stores , Uganda ) transfer treatment room . Baseline clinical parameter include pulse rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure , temperature , oxygen saturation , level consciousness , Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) Pain score ( 0 pain 10 bad pain possible ) sit VOC pain note . This follow placement peripheral intravenous cannula , G22-G20 ( part standard care ) subsequent fluid load 15mls per kg crystalloid , repeat require . Other non analgesic therapy prescribe primary care provider start concurrently . The recruited patient randomize allocated receive Ketamine 1mg/kg ( study drug ) morphine 0.1mg/kg ( active control ) intravenous infusion use syringe pump ( Agilia , Fresenius Kabi ) 10 minute . The vital sign NRS Ramsay sedation score ( RSS ) reassess record 5 , 10 20 minute end drug infusion . However , patient monitoring continuous . At 20 minute , patient NRS 5 give second dose without cross . Monitoring continue . If NRS le 5 , continue reassess every 20 minute ( vital sign , NRS , RSS adverse event ) either inpatient admission ward 120 minute care ward team.. If require third dose pain medication time study , deem treatment failure treat pediatrician contact provide pain control . Any Ketamine ( even morphine ) side effect list risk safety section monitor among study subject treat study team .</detailed_description>
