	<brief_summary>Background : Mechanical ventilation life save intervention patient acute respiratory failure , instance , due infection trauma . The main goal mechanical ventilation improve oxygenation decrease load impose respiratory muscle . Unfortunately , mechanical ventilation come adverse event include disuse atrophy weakness respiratory muscle . The diaphragm main muscle inspiration therefore clinical entity commonly refer ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction ( VIDD ) . Several study show inspiratory muscle weakness associate adverse outcome , include prolonged duration mechanical ventilation . Inactivity disuse recognize risk factor development VIDD : disuse may result excessive unload diaphragm ventilator . Therefore , clinician aim limit risk VIDD use ventilator mode allow patient perform least part total work breathing deem clinically appropriate . However , even so-called assist mode ventilation use , excessive unload diaphragm may occur ; without use technology allow monitor diaphragm function , clinician often uncertain whether muscle indeed actively work . Continuous record electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) use monitor diaphragm muscle activity ICU patient . Furthermore , sonographic measurement diaphragm thickness allows easy quantification diaphragmatic activity ( thicken fraction ) well provide potentially useful mechanism study diaphragm injury function mechanical ventilation . Aim : To assess duration diaphragm muscle inactivity patient admit ICU use EAdi monitoring ass correlation diaphragm thicknening fraction , measure ultrasound , electrical activity , measure EAdi . Hypothesis : Diaphragm muscle inactivity frequently occur early phase ICU admission Design : Observational pilot study ventilate adult ICU patient admit ICU St Michael 's Hospital . The investigator aim enroll 75 patient . Primary outcome : Time catheter position first EAdi ( &gt; 5 uV last least 5 minute )</brief_summary>
