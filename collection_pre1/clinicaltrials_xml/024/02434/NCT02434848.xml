	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection result great risk adverse outcomes HIV-infected individual , include rapid progression cirrhosis associate complication hepatocellular carcinoma . For reason , well share route transmission two virus , UK International guidance recommend HBV-negative HIV-infected individual offer vaccination HBV . Unfortunately , response rate population low 17.5 - 40 % standard vaccination course . To improve response , strategy use double dose standard vaccine ( e.g . Engerix B ) recommend several guideline previous non-responders , although currently limit evidence approach . An alternative strategy use vaccine novel adjuvant Fendrix observational clinical data Investigators HIV cohort suggest response rate high 81 % individual achieve HBV surface antibody ( HBsAb ) level &gt; 100 group respond previous standard HBV vaccine course . However , cost Fendrix considerably high Engerix B control trial require confirm whether approach warrant . Furthermore , insights potential mechanism Fendrix may elicit good response would valuable optimising future vaccine strategy population . The Investigators propose conduct randomise , open label , active-controlled pilot study compare double dose Engerix B Fendrix HIV-infected non-responders standard HBV vaccine course , provide necessary data design power large multicentre randomise control trial . Outcome measure include proportion individual seroconverting HBsAb level &gt; 100 follow vaccination course , magnitude quality HBV-specific CD4+ T-cell response elicit vaccine durability HBsAb response 1 year follow end vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing Immunogenicity Fendrix vs. Double-dose Engerix B HIV-infected Non-responders Standard Hepatitis B Vaccination Courses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare immunological response HIV-infected non-responders standard hepatitis B vaccination course immunization either double-dose Engerix B Fendrix : 1 . Investigators measure proportion individual seroconverting Hepatitis B surface antibody titres &gt; 100 ( ≥10 ) IU/ml 8 week immunisation course , well durability response 1 year follow completion course . The primary aim provide preliminary data head head study two approach power large multi-centre randomized control trial . 2 . Investigators define magnitude quality Hepatitis B-specific CD4+ T-cell response follow vaccination , thus obtain key immunological data fill knowledge gap T-cell responses Hepatitis B vaccination , require support rationale design future multi-centre , randomize study compare vaccination strategy HIV-infected non-responders standard Hepatitis B vaccine course . The research original . There one publish study date look efficacy double-dose Engerix B HIV-infected non-responders standard courses1 . There currently anecdotal experience use Fendrix group Investigators cohort others . There head-to-head comparison two strategy .</detailed_description>
