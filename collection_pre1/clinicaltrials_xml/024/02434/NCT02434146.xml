	<brief_title>Topical Phenylephrine Solution Preventing Oral Mucosa Bone Marrow Transplant Patients Receiving Cyclophosphamide Total Body Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability phenylephrine ( topical phenylephrine solution ) apply topically oral mucosa bone marrow transplant patient treat cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose phenylephrine apply topically oral mucosa bone marrow transplant patient treat cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation . III . To evaluate efficacy phenylephrine apply topically oral mucosa prevent and/or decrease severity oral mucositis bone marrow transplant patient treat cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study topical phenylephrine solution follow phase II study . Patients undergo cyclophosphamide total body irradiation regimen receive topical phenylephrine solution via spray oral mucosa 15-20 minute prior cyclophosphamide infusion , 25-30 minute begin cyclophosphamide infusion , 15-20 minute prior radiation treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 2 week 3 month .</detailed_description>
