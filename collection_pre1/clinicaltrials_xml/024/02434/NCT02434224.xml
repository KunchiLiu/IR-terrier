	<brief_title>Creative Music Therapy Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature infant highly prevalent vulnerable group paediatric care , face several short- long-term challenge . Research brain development premature infant demonstrate high incidence white grey matter abnormality neurobehavioral delay , well increase risk brain injury . There grow awareness premature infant need individualize nurturing interaction caregiver neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) support healthy development prevent future difficulty . One particular intervention may considerable potential NICU creative music therapy ( CMT ) , individualize , interactive , resource- needs-oriented music therapy approach . Results demonstrate CMT facilitate relaxation stabilization premature infant ; experience inter-subjectivity music , infant empower engage meaningful nurturing interaction ( Haslbeck , 2013 , b ) . Several researcher ( Als , 2012 ; Trevarthen , 2008 ; Schore , 2003 ) describe interactive multi-sensory experience fetus particularly facilitate brain development learn socio-emotional figure , respectively , prematurely born infant . It assume positive auditory experience promote premature infant ' early brain maturation contribute healthy neurodevelopment ( Xu et al. , 2009 ) . Studies music neuroscience demonstrate music promotes neurobiological process modulate synaptic plasticity , neuronal learning readjustment human brain ( Rickard et al. , 2005 ) . The individualized approach active music therapy may especially activate brain structure involve emotional , sensorimotor cognitive processing ( Koelsch , 2009 ; Fachner et al. , 2012 ) . Since , one hand , individualize interactive experience , hand , music may alter brain development fetus young infant , question arise whether CMT might actually promote premature infant 's brain development facilitate nurture socio-emotional auditory interactive experience time . Therefore randomize , control , clinical trial conduct . 30 premature infant receive CMT hospitalization time 30 premature infant without music therapy serve control group . The primary objective explore experience CMT premature infant improve brain growth development 38-42 week correct GA . The main secondary objective explore CMT improve neurobehavioral outcome premature infant 9 24 month , well 5 year age . Magnetic resonance imaging use evaluate infant ' cerebral cortical development myelination . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) use evaluate infant ' brain function maturation . Insights possible long-term sustainable outcome gain via neuro-developmental follow-up examination . It hypothesize experience CMT neonatal care improve short- long-term neurological outcome . We expect experimental group demonstrate superior brain growth development 38-42 week correct GA well improve cognitive , behavioral motor developmental outcomes later . This paper introduce first insight preliminary result ongoing study . Strategies challenge inherent conduct controlled clinical trial within vulnerable group discuss .</detailed_description>
