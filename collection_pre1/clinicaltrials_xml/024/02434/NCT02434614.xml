	<brief_summary>Several prospective randomize trial demonstrate concurrent chemoradiotherapy superior radiotherapy alone treatment locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . Based evidence , concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) with/without sequential chemotherapy become standard care locoregionally advance NPC . However , evidence standard treatment locoregionally advance NPC base two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy ( 2DCRT ) . As intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) technique widely use last decade , IMRT improve treatment outcome patient NPC , especially local control rate . Currently , retrospective study compare IMRT alone vs. IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy , report concurrent chemotherapy fail improve survival rate patient locoregionally advanced disease , increase severity acute toxicity . People start reconsider role CCRT . Therefore , propose randomized phase III non-inferiority study reassess efficacy contribution concurrent chemotherapy locoregionally advance NPC IMRT era .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Followed IMRT With Without Concurrent Chemotherapy Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients previously untreated non-metastatic newly histologically-confirmed non-keratinizing III-IVb NPC ( UICC/AJCC 7th edition ) randomly assign receive induction chemotherapy follow IMRT alone ( investigational group ) induction chemotherapy follow IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy ( control group ) . During induction chemotherapy , patient group receive 60 mg/m2 docetaxel intravenously day 1 , 60 mg/m2 cisplatin intravenously day 1 , 600 mg/m2/d fluorouracil continuous infusion day 1-5 ; three cycle administer interval 3 week . During radiotherapy , patient investigational group receive IMRT alone patient control group receive IMRT , concurrently weekly intravenous cisplatin 30 mg/m2 6-7 week . IMRT give 2.0-2.3 Gy per fraction five daily fraction per week 6-7 week , Cumulative dos &gt; 66 Gy primary tumor &gt; 50 Gy bilateral cervical lymph node potential site local infiltration . The primary endpoint failure-free survival ( FFS ) . Secondary clinical endpoint include overall survival ( OS ) , locoregional failure-free survival ( LRFFS ) , distant failure-free survival ( DFFS ) rate toxic effect .</detailed_description>
