	<brief_summary>Background : Music therapy recommend adjuvant therapy preterm infants mother throughout stay Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , show beneficial effect , although conclusive evidence remain lack . Objectives : To study usefulness two form music , well music , pain physiological behavioral parameter preterm infant heel stick procedure obtain blood Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . Hypotheses : Infants hear music chosen mother less pain optimal behavioral physiologic response compare infant hear lullaby music . Methods : An analytical observational study randomize cross-over design utilized . Inclusion stable infant bear 28 36 week gestation , normal hearing . Neonatal Physiologic responses [ heart rate ( HR ) , oxygen saturation , ( 02 sat ) respiratory rate ( RR ) ] Behavioral States record heel stick procedure . Maternal age , education , pregnancy complication also document . Pain response record use Neonatal Pain , Agitation Sedation Scale ( NPASS ) . Ethical consideration : The study impose minimal risk infant . One potential risk infant may become agitated listening music , especially time feed . Based previous research , infant tend calm listen music . However , infant may hungry fussy , music exacerbate agitation . To prevent occur investigator perform heel stick close feeding time investigator vigilantly time monitor infant 's agitation . Because music show calm infant stop cry , benefit outweigh risk . The heel stick perform routinely infant ( often 3-6 time day ) . The investigator perform additional heel stick study , rather intervene one schedule heel stick procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance Study In United States half million infant bear prematurely every year , approximately 12.3 % % birth ( CDC , 2011 ) . These infant require extensive care hospitalize long periods time Neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . They expose multitude stressful painful event link negative developmental outcome . ( Badr et al. , 2010 , Orcesi et al. , 2012 ) . To reduce stress NICU allow optimal neurobehavioral function , range therapy study . Music therapy one intervention suggest tool alleviate stress NICU ( Keith , Russell &amp; Weaver , 2009 ) . Music therapy long document reduce stress , fatigue , pain enhance relaxation . A meta-analysis 30 clinical trial use MT infant NICU ( Standley , 2012 ) conclude MT significant benefit heart rate , behavior state , oxygen saturation , sucking/feeding ability , length stay . However , efficacy music pain , physiologic behavioral response preterm infant fully support . While recent meta-analysis focus preterm infant note music therapy significant benefit especially live music use early infant 's NICU stay , study support beneficial effect music ( Alipour et al. , 2013 ) . The American Music Therapy Association ( AMTA ) define music therapy clinical evidence-based use music intervention address physical , psychological , emotional , cognitive , social need individual , order promote overall well-being , relieve stress alleviate pain . Physiologically music act redirect one 's attention away pain inducer distraction , induce rhythmic breathing , allow systematic rhythmic release body tension . It also trigger autonomic nervous system allow relaxation muscle tone , brain wave frequency , galvanic skin response , pupillary reflex ( Kaminski , 1996 ) . The preterm infant music The benefit classical music therapy preterm infant NICU document study . Outcomes measure include improved physiological behavioral response . Physiological condition assess include high oxygen saturation level , decrease heart rate , decrease incidence episode apneas bradycardia low energy expenditure ( Amini et al. , 2013 ; Chou , Wang , Chen &amp; Pai , 2003 ; Keidar Mandel , Mimouni , &amp; Lubetzky 2010 ) Enhanced behavioral response include : increased calm , quiet , alert behavioral state , decrease cry fussy state improve feeding behavior ( Keith , Russell &amp; Weaver 2009 ; Lowey et al 2013 ) . Increased formula intake , increase weight gain less day hospitalization also report ( Cevasco &amp; Grant , 2005 ; Standley et al. , 2010 ) . In term effect music pain response main objective study , four study publish date . One study assess physiological . behavioral pain response preterm infant recovery heel lance 14 preterm infant 29 36 week post-conceptual age ( PCA ) listen Brahms ' lullaby . Results show rapid return baseline heart rate , enhance behavioral state less pain infant listen music ( Butt &amp; Kisilevsky , 2000 ) . Bo &amp; Callaghan ( 2000 ) compare four different type intervention ( non-nutrative sucking ( NNS ) , music therapy ( MT ) , combine NNS MT ( NNS + MT ) , intervention 27 infant . Results show three intervention significant effect HR , oxygen saturation pain NNS + MT strong effect . Whipple ( 2008 ) randomly assign 60 infant age 32 37 week one three treatment group : pacifier-activated lullaby ( PAL ) , pacifier-only , no-contact . Pacifier-only infant receive music reinforcement sucking , no-contact infant provide pacifier music point procedure . There significant difference physiologic measure group ; however , infant PAL group low stress level during-the heelstick procedure no-contact group pacifier group . To test enhance kangaroo mother care ( KMC ) add rocking , sing suck efficacious simple KMC procedural pain preterm neonates 90 preterm infant GA 32-36 week randomly assign 2 condition : KMC addition rocking , sing suck infant hold KMC without additional stimulation . The result show significant difference condition ( Johnston et al , 2009 ) . To summarize 4 study provide inconclusive evidence benefit music therapy pain response preterm infant research warrant . Furthermore , systematic review randomize controlled trial Hartling et al. , ( 2009 ) conclude study efficacy music pain response preterm infant low quality methodologically study necessary . The GAP Research Studies investigate impact exposure form auditory stimulation infant complicate large range decibel level mode delivery . A likely explanation many study conduct close time American Academy Pediatrics Committee Environmental Health make recommendation consider safe sound level within NICU ( hourly Leq 50 dB , hourly L10 55 dB , 1-second duration Lmax &lt; 70 dB ) . Furthermore , study use different mode music auditory stimuli lack standardization . No one study look efficacy music chosen mother list pregnant likely soothe infant Methods Design : An analytical observational study randomize cross-over design utilized . Setting : The NICU American University Beirut Medical Center ( AUBMC ) . Subjects : To achieve power 0.8 α = 0.05 one-tailed medium effect size 0.61 medium correlation ( r = 0.50 ) among two repeat measure use F-test , sample size 40 infant suffice . This sample size base previous study show significant difference pain score use follow formula : N = ( Zα + Zβ ) 2 x 2 σ 2 Mean difference 2 Instruments/outcome measure All outcome measure record three nurse train reliability r = 80 NPASS Behavioral States blind intervention type . Physiologic measure : Heart rate , oxygen saturation level respiratory rate record every 1 minute , ( 5 minute , 5 minute heel stick ) observe monitor Behavioral state : The infant 's state give numerical score follow : 1 , deep sleep ; 2 , light sleep ; 3 , drowsy ; 4 , quiet awake alert ; 5 , actively awake arouse ; 6 , highly arouse , upset , cry ; 7 , prolong respiratory pause &gt; 8 second ( Als et al. , 2005 ) Pain assessment : The N-PASS , Neonatal Pain , Agitation Sedation Scale use ass pain valid , clinically reliable , age-appropriate method continuously systematically assess pain stressful behavior state infants gestational age 23 week 0 100 day life ( Hummel , Puchalski , Creech , &amp; Weiss , 2008 ) . At AUBMC 's NICU , N-PASS use routinely pain agitation tool nurse assess infant ' response pain . The intervention : Music therapy include either lullaby use earlier research study mother choice music listen infant utero . Music deliver portable mp3 player head phone . Procedure A within-subject , crossover , repeat design use infant act control . Infants receive either mother 's music 5 minute , classical lullaby 5 minute music heel stick procedure regularly schedule infant NICU . After heel stick 5 minute music provide . Noise level assess continuously 10 cm infant 's ear sound analyzer decibel scale filter ( 407790 Octave Band Sound Analyzer , type 2 Integrating Sound Level Meter Decibel-A Scale Filter , respectively ; Extech Instruments , Melrose , MA , USA ) . Infants ' physiological behavioral state assess record heel stick pain assessment do heel stick . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS Windows version 22.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Comparisons intervention make use repeated measure analysis variance ( RANOVA ) , appropriate distribution normality post hoc analysis Bonferroni adjustment Categorical data analyze use chi-square test .</detailed_description>
