	<criteria>Histologic proof malignancy suitable thoracic radiation therapy Patient planning undergo radiation therapy primary recurrent carcinoma lung oligometastatic carcinoma lung . Age ≥ 18 year old Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60 % At least part tumor must visible observed diagnostic planning CT . The RCCT scan must interpretable exhibit excessive motion artifact cause irregular patient breathing . Able bronchoscopic placement Calypso transponder confirm recent ( within past 8 week ) CT scan . Able breathe regularly gate treatment , measure Varian RPM system . Patients clinically significant active infection . Bronchiectasis region intend implantation . History hypersensitivity nickel . Other medical condition laboratory value would , discretion investigator , preclude patient participation clinical study . Deemed unable safely undergo tolerate flexible bronchoscopy per institutional guideline Unable tolerate anesthesia sedation Enrolled clinical study investigator believe conflict investigation . Female patient pregnant nursing Exclusion criterion Calypso transponder : Implants chest region contain metal conductive material ( e.g. , metal implant , rod , plate ) Calypso Medical considers interfere Calypso System 's electromagnetic localization . Active implanted device , pacemaker , defibrillator , drug infusion pump since effect Calypso System operation device unknown . Patients whose lung tumor monitor MR image part standard clinical care . Implantation transponder degrade MR image . Posterior lesion would &gt; 19 cm distance Calypso detector plate .</criteria>
