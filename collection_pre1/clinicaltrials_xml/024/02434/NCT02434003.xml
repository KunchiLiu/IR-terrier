	<detailed_description>By identify patient model predict significant progression investigator could focus effort pro-active towards brace wear risk progression . With advent new growth modulation technique , patient could also potentially receive early management curve prevent progression diminish need surgical correction fusion curve . Alternatively , identify patient progress immediately first visit , investigator could arguably decrease number need treat 4 2 remove patient wo n't progress matter treatment . So , prediction model impact patient risk progression also impact brace despite low risk progression . Patient enrollment : Patients meet inclusion criterion offer enrollment project . If family wish enroll project , informed consent process undertaken patient enrol . If Patients need treat brace No change usual treatment monitoring institute . Therefore , patient allow undergo brace treatment . The investigator aware brace treatment could impact curve progression patient still include progression despite brace treatment may give meaningful information regard difficult-to-treat curve . Patient brace treatment remove brace least night appointment follow-up spine radiograph . Also protocol require patient least one spine radiograph brace every 12 month . Bracing compliance evaluate specific covariable upcoming study . To good understand impact brace progression , investigator use brace monitor , pressure sensitive transducer monitor brace wear brace effectiveness , multicenter study use data generate monitor co-factor improve prediction model . If patient need surgery Although patient show sufficient curve progression undergo surgical correction keep prospective cohort surgery , data still analyze assess correlation local 3-D measurement curve progression . -Data collection Data collect first visit include : - Demographic data - past medical history - gender - body-mass index ( weight height ) - family history - sexual maturity ( start menses girl ) - rib prominence - initial radiographic evaluation . Data collect follow-up visit ( ideally every 6 month ) - body-mass index ( weight height ) - menarchal status , - skeletal maturity - rib prominence . - Radiographic evaluation ( least every 12 month study period , without brace ) . - Image acquisition transfer central measurement site . Image acquisition standardize site accord standard operating procedure . All image acquire EOS™ system fashion base position propose Horton et al . standardized lateral radiograph use hand-on-clavicle position . The radiograph take way thus minimize variability . For center without EOS™ system part entire study , utilization calibration belt allow radiograph take calibrated environment . The position use image acquisition EOS™ system . - Three-dimensional reconstruction spine The stereo radiographic image use create external three-dimensional representation vertebral body use specific algorithm . First , spline fit center vertebral body PA lateral view . The information image use reconstruct 3-D spline curve act rough three-dimensional scaffold onto local vertebral intervertebral reconstruction take place . The vertebral endplate represent crude preliminary model spine use set cubic template roughly represent vertebral body stack top one another form spinal column . A global configuration deformable spine model thus describe cubic template associate vertebral level . The final reconstruction complete use priori knowledge database scoliotic normal vertebra measure investigator 's research group . The priori knowledge model rely description vertebra deformable model , incorporate statistical knowledge geometrical structure pathological variability . The statistically optimized reconstruction use determine intervertebral disk shape level . - Three-dimensional stereoradiographic reconstruction pelvis The pelvis reconstruct 3-D normal AIS subject use combination Non-Stereo Corresponding Points ( NSCP ) Non-Stereo Corresponding Contours ( NSCC ) method , successfully investigator 's team reconstruct spine 3D . Preliminary evaluation technique give overall accuracy 1,6 mm , adequate calculation clinical geometric index pelvis . Four step require 3D reconstruction technique : 1 . Identification seven specific region pelvis ; 2 . Display preliminary model 45 control point . The control point modify real time user ( NSCP ) ; 3 . Interactive identification regional contour ( NSCC ) ; 4 . Generation personalize 3D pelvic model deform generic 3D pelvic model use 3D geometrical kriging . - Local three-dimensional measurement vertebrae disk : The calculated parameter divide six category . Each category refers global ( whole spine ) , regional ( scoliotic segment ) local ( vertebra ) descriptor . Vertebra centroid understood halfway point center two endplate vertebra . The local vertebra axis system define Scoliosis Research Society ( SRS ) 3D terminology group : origin centroid vertebral body , local ' z ' axis pass center upper low endplate , ' ' axis parallel line join similar landmark base right leave pedicle . 1 . Cobb Angles : Cobb angle define angle upper low endplate respective end vertebra curve . Cobb angle measure frontal plane , plane maximal deformation 3D sagittal plane thoracic kyphosis ( T4-T12 ) lumbar lordosis ( L1-S1 ) . 2 . Plane maximal deformation : Axial angle plane Cobb angle maximal . 3 . Three-dimensional wedge vertebral body disk : Wedging apical vertebral body plane maximal deformation ( 3D plane ) mean maximal 3D wedge two apical intervertebral disk . Maximal 3D wedge represent wedge measure plane , wherein wedge value maximal around vertical axis . If apex disk , mean 3D wedge apical vertebral body calculate 3D wedge apical disk document . 3D disk wedge analyzed level spine ( T1-T2 L4-L5 ) . 4 . Axial intervertebral rotation apex , upper low junctional level thoracolumbar level : Rotation two adjacent vertebra upper , apical , low curve level thoracolumbar junction ( T12-L1 ) axial plane accord inferior local vertebra reference . 5 . Torsion : Mean sum intervertebral axial rotation ( measure accord local referential inferior vertebra ) two hemicurvatures curve ( upper end vertebra apex low end vertebra apex ) . 6 . Slenderness ( local T6 , T12 L4 regional T1-L5 ) : Ratio height ( distance superior inferior endplate center vertebra ) width ( measure center vertebra use line perpendicular height line medio lateral direction ) vertebral body T6 , T12 L4 vertebra . Ratio length spine T1 L5 mean width vertebral body T6-T12 L4 . The measurement make replace width depth ( line perpendicular height line center vertebra anteroposterior direction ) . - Geometric pelvic index : Geometric pelvic index calculate automatically generation 3D pelvic model . Indices describe orientation pelvis 3D ( positional index ) , base line join center femoral head ( hip axis ) , calculate first . Pelvic axial rotation orientation hip axis around vertical axis ( gravity line ) view transverse plane . Pelvic obliquity orientation hip axis around horizontal line view coronal plane . Pelvic tilt orientation pelvis around medio-lateral axis pelvis view sagittal plane . In last case , least another landmark pelvis ( center upper sacral plate ) need identified addition hip axis . The sacral slope ( angle upper sacral plate horizontal line also calculate since highly correlate lumbar lordosis . Sacral obliquity angle upper sacral plate horizontal line . Morphological index pelvis ( dependent patient 's position ) compute reference coordinate system base hip axis orientation , order eliminate effect pelvic axial rotation obliquity . This mean transformation reference coordinate system allow calculation morphological index true coronal , axial sagittal plane pelvis . The investigator select pelvis reference system base pelvic vertebra principle Dubousset , state pelvis view separate vertebra . As describe earlier , numerous morphologic parameter pelvis use past , detailed Tables I III . Of , thorough review literature , investigator select consider 7 pertinent specific index . The investigator base decision potential association pelvic index pathogenesis AIS . Since demonstrate close relationship pelvic incidence lumbar lordosis AIS , investigator select morphological index pelvis correlate spine geometry .</detailed_description>
