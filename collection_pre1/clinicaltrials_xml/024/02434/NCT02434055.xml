	<brief_summary>Purpose : To evaluate accuracy AVERT PLUS monitor contrast volume use angiographic procedure . Research Design : The AVERT PLUS FDA 510K clear device consist contrast delivery modulator design reduce unnecessary contrast dye delivery patient angiography ( coronary peripheral ) concomitant system precisely measure contrast volume deliver patient . This first man prospective observational study accuracy system quantify contract volume use clinically indicated angiography cardiac catheterization laboratory .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Novel Method Contrast Volume Quantification - AVERT PLUS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty consecutive subject consent participate undergoing plan angiography enrol . The AVERT PLUS system external patient connect control syringe physician use deliver contrast dye patient . For injection physician performs , start syringe volume , end syringe volume , net contrast deliver patient record . At time , net volume deliver patient also record AVERT PLUS console . For injection , two set variable compare determine accuracy AVERT PLUS quantify net contrast volume use .</detailed_description>
