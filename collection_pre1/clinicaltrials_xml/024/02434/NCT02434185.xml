	<brief_summary>The bilateral deficit phenomenon ( BLD ) define inability neuromuscular system generate maximal force two homonymous limb operate simultaneously ( bilateral contraction ) respect force develop limbs act separately ( unilateral contraction ) . From applied perspective , movement pattern bilateral homonymous limb often developed activity day living , e.g . rise chair open jar . The BLD consider intrinsic property human neuromuscular system could enough important constitute performance-limiting factor postmenopausal woman involve degenerative loss muscular strength . Therefore , specific analysis phenomenon relation activity daily live , climb step rise chair , crucial detecting variable neuromuscular performance develop strategy minimize loss strength .</brief_summary>
