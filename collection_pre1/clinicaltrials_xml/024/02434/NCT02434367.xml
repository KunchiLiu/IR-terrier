	<detailed_description>Recruitment , consent , randomization occur first postoperative visit radiation oncologist . A 1:1 randomization occur WWE program usual care ( script discussion benefit exercise radiotherapy ) . Prior initiation radiation , woman arm complete 68 question questionnaire pain , depression , sleep , social support . In addition , peripheral blood drawn analysis pre-radiation measure inflammatory biomarkers . Women randomize WWE program also receive daily walk log ask fill return last week radiation ( 6 week standard fractionation 4.5 week hypofractionation ) , 4-6 week post radiotherapy . Also , last week radiotherapy 4-6 week radiotherapy patient repeat questionnaire blood draw measure inflammatory biomarkers . Contact study participant 3 point time enrollment randomization : Baseline : At meeting , requirement study review , study material provide ( control arm : one page explanation discuss potential benefit exercise fatigue , experimental arm : WWE workbook , print walk log ) . Participants complete questionnaire undergo assessment include blood draw . For experimental arm , ask begin walk program within week , note walk experience daily log . Last week radiation : All participant repeat questionnaire assessment day last week radiation . A repeat blood draw take . In addition WWE arm walking log review . For receive hypofractionated radiotherapy , occur week 4 . For receive standard fractionation occur week 6 . 4-6 week follow end radiation : All participant repeat questionnaire assessment . A repeat blood draw take . In addition WWE arm walking log review . Patients randomize usual care arm receive document information exercise improve fatigue radiotherapy . The sheet summarize finding 3 randomized study exercise intervention radiotherapy . The primary activity require study subject 4-6-week self-directed ( non-group ) WWE walk program participant place time convenient . Participants ask walk safe comfortable pace , increase minute per day rate sustain , ultimate goal 30 minutes/day least 5 days/week . They ask maintain daily walk log provide , enter total minute per day .</detailed_description>
