	<brief_summary>Objectives : To estimate rate appropriate hospital admission , discharge home episode would appropriate admission hospital , patient exacerbation COPD use appropriateness explicit criterion develop RAND appropriateness methodology . To evaluate validity criterion look correlation morbid-mortality , use medication health resource . To identify variability appropriateness admission/discharge among different centre participate study . Methodology : Prospective observational cohort study . 1 . The investigator apply previously develop explicit criterion sample COPD exacerbation present Emergency Department participate hospital ( 16 centre ) . 2 . The investigator evaluate variability among centre compare appropriateness rate . 3 . To study validity criterion , admit investigator collect information evolution ( length stay , need medication , quality life ) , complication , vital status admission discharge , 2 month visit Emergency Department vital status , complication , readmission quality life . On discharged home Emergency Department , investigator check presence complication , vital status , readmission quality life . People train collect need information , Emergency Department , admission , personal interview discharge home 2 month visit Emergency Department .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Appropriate Admission COPD Exacerbation From Emergency Department . Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective cohort study perform validate explicit criterion develop RAM . Other goal cohort study : predict mortality , ICU IRCU admission , hospital length stay , change symptoms evaluate variability among hospital appropriateness hospital admission patient experience COPD exacerbation study variability access care outcome . Sixteen hospital belong Spanish National Health Service agree participate : Hospital Costa del Sol , Hospital Valme , Hospital de Motril , Corporació Sanitaria Parc Taulí , Hospital del Mar , Hospital Universitario de La Princesa , Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón , Hospital Universitario La Paz , Hospital de Móstoles , Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla , Hospital Santa Marina , Hospital San Eloy , Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo , Hospital Txagorritxu , Complejo Hospitalario Donostia , Hospital Cruces . Patients attend EDs 16 hospital exacerbation COPD inform goal study invite voluntarily participate . All information keep confidential . The Institutional Review Boards participate hospital approve project . Recruitment start June 2008 end September 2010 . Patients candidate study present ED participate hospital symptom consistent exacerbation COPD . Exacerbation define event natural course disease characterize change patient 's baseline dyspnea , cough , and/or sputum beyond normal day-to-day variation , acute onset , may warrant change regular medication patient underlie COPD . Two possible presentation consider : Existing COPD . Patients consider previously diagnose COPD FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) quotient &lt; 70 % , negative bronchodilation test FEV1 change &lt; 200 mL 15 % baseline value . New COPD . Patients previously diagnose COPD disease suspect also eligible inclusion study . This include smoker former smoker 15 pack per year dyspnea , cough , expectoration three month per year , experience symptom resemble clinical manifestation compatible COPD exacerbation . The diagnosis confirm spirometry within 60 day index episode time patient stable , i.e. , absence increase symptom change background therapy . If diagnosis COPD confirm , patient exclude study . Patients exclude study COPD complicate comorbidity pneumonia , pneumothorax , pulmonary embolism ; lung cancer ; left cardiac insufficiency . Other exclusion criterion include diagnosis asthma , extensive bronchiectasis , sequelae tuberculosis , pleural thickening , restrictive disease . Patients wish participate also exclude . Data collect cohort study A substantial amount clinical data need meet objective IRYSS-CAS . Data several time point need : patient 's evaluation ED ; time decision make hospitalize patient discharge home ; medical ward ( need ) ; post-hospitalization post-discharge follow-up . It must note ED physician ask gather information would usually collect patient experience exacerbation COPD . Instead , train data manager gather data hospital primary care medical record use manual instruction aim standardize data collection . Some information require review patient 's medical record . Patients admit hospital interview 1 7 day admission . Patients discharge ED home interview telephone , around , 1 7 day discharge . All patient interview telephone 60 day index event . In ED . As true almost encounter ED , substantial information gather patient experience exacerbation COPD . The main data collect related patient 's respiratory function ( gasometry , respiratory rate , dyspnea ) , consciousness level measure Glasgow Coma scale , background , presence pathology record Charlson Comorbidity Index . At time decision making . Data collect ED decision time related patient 's respiratory status moment well variable need create appropriateness scenario , determine severity exacerbation , evaluate study criterion . In hospital . For patient admitted hospital , collect data directly patient 's medical record direct interview first day admission discharge . Patients interview general health status ( response question 1 Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) questionnaire [ 16 ] ) , degree dyspnea , base Medical Research Council Dyspnea Index [ 17 ] , physical activity level ( base scale employ previously various study also complete EuroQol-5D . Patients also ask social support level functional dependency . This information record first 24 hour arrival ED discharge . Following discharge home ED . Among patient discharge home ED , telephone interview conduct around 1 day , 7 day , 60 day discharge assess level dyspnea , physical activity , general health ( see previous description ) , use response medication , need supplemental oxygen , need visit patient 's primary care physician , subsequent ED visit hospital readmission , vital status , presence symptom , social support , level functional dependency . During follow-up . Data collect follow-up include general health status ( SF-36 question ) , degree dyspnea , physical activity level , quality life , previously describe . Readmission within 30 day index exacerbation reason , readmission reason 31 60 day index exacerbation record , complication , include sign , symptom , syndrome disease , appear worsen 60-day observation period attributable COPD treatment . For patient know COPD , additional variable collect medical record include baseline severity COPD measure FEV1 ; hospital admission previous 12 month ; baseline therapy ( inhaled long-acting beta agonist , long-acting anticholinergic , inhale corticosteroid and/or supplemental oxygen ) , presence associate disease diabetes , hypertension , ischemic heart disease and/or valve disease , cor pulmonale , peptic ulcer disease , psychiatric disorder , rheumatic disease , history stroke deep vein thrombosis , others need determine Charlson Comorbidity Index . Mortality information one year also record patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible study present Emergency Department symptoms consistent exacerbation COPD . COPD confirm patient forced expiratory volume 1 second/forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) quotient &lt; 70 % . When COPD newly diagnose Emergency Department visit , include study patient COPD confirm spirometry within 60 day index episode time stable . Patients exclude study , time see Emergency Department , exacerbation COPD complicate comorbidity pneumonia , pneumothorax , pulmonary embolism , lung cancer , leave cardiac failure . Patients wish participate also exclude .</criteria>
