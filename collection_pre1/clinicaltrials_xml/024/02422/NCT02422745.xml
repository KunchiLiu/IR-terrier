	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether take daily , dietary supplement cocoa extract ( contain cocoa flavanols theobromine cocoa bean ) and/or standard multivitamin reduces risk develop cardiovascular disease ( include heart attack , stroke , coronary revascularization , cardiovascular mortality ) cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COcoa Supplement Multivitamin Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The COcoa Supplement Multivitamin Outcomes Study ( COSMOS ) randomize clinical trial cocoa extract supplement ( contain total 600 mg/d flavanols , include 80 mg. ( - ) -epicatechins ) , standard multivitamin supplement reduce risk cardiovascular disease cancer among woman age 65 year old men age 60 year old . Women recruit among active Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) Extension Study participant , men recruit among non-randomized respondent VITamin D OmegA-3 Trial ( VITAL ) . Women respond randomized VITAL also include well woman men express interest research conduct Brigham Women 's Hospital . Several small randomize trial demonstrate benefit cocoa flavanols intermediate outcome , include blood pressure , lipid , insulin sensitivity , flow-mediated vasodilation . For multivitamin , prior large-scale randomized trial middle-aged old men show significant reduction cancer , comparable trial data woman lack . For intervention , large-scale clinical trial COSMOS could major clinical public health implication . Eligible participant assign chance ( like coin toss ) one four group : ( 1 ) daily cocoa extract multivitamin ; ( 2 ) daily cocoa extract multivitamin placebo ; ( 3 ) daily cocoa extract placebo multivitamin ; ( 4 ) daily cocoa extract placebo multivitamin placebo . Participants equal chance assign four group 3 4 chance get least one active agent . Participants group take three pill day : two capsule contain either cocoa extract cocoa extract placebo , one tablet contain either multivitamin multivitamin placebo . Participants receive study pill convenient calendar pack via U.S. mail . Participants also ask complete short mail questionnaire year . The questionnaire ask health ; lifestyle habit , diet , physical activity , smoking ; use medication dietary supplement ; family history illness new medical diagnosis . Occasionally , participant may receive phone call study staff collect information clarify responses questionnaire . At baseline , approximately 6,000 COSMOS participant provide optional blood urine sample determine whether study agent significantly change biomarkers risk factor related cardiovascular disease cancer . Selected participant either specimen collect mailed specimen collection kit return participant , blood , urine , blood pressure , anthropometric measurement collect technician Examination Management Services , Inc. ( EMSI ) , national clinical service provider . A subgroup provide baseline specimens measurement ask provide follow-up sample measurement . At baseline year 2 trial , approximately 500 participant live within drive distance Boston , Massachusetts provide additional measurement in-clinic study visit Clinical Translational Science Center ( CTSC ) Brigham Women 's Hospital . These visit include cognitive function assessment , anthropometrics , physical function assessment , blood pressure measurement . At baseline year follow-up , approximately 4,000 COSMOS participant complete web-based assessment cognitive function . Over course trial , participant complete 4 assessment , take approximately 25 minute complete .</detailed_description>
