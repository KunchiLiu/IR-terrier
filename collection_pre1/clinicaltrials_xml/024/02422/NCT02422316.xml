	<brief_summary>Background : Only around 20 % patient see hospital suspect Acute Coronary Syndrome Acute Myocardial Infarction . However , several study indicate patient ACS exclude conventional method sustain high cardiac morbidity mortality background population . Not patient identify traditional risk factor cholesterol , hypertension , diabetes conventional method ECG , troponin clinical symptom . Non-Contrast Cardiac-CT measure amount calcification coronary artery might useful addition predict future cardiac event patient group . The aim study double-blinded study determine whether non-contrast CT scan calcium score use identify patient increase risk death cardiac event within follow 12 month acute admission troponin measurement normal . Methods : The study investigate patient suspect Acute Coronary syndrome examine subsequently send home emergency- cardiology department without ACS another obvious explanation . 750 patient , age 30-70 year include study : `` Identification risk factor non-cardiac chest pain patient '' offer non-contrast CT scan calcium score within 14 day hospital contact . The participant include 12 month follow , result calcium score reveal neither patient investigator . After 12 month result scan compare rate cardiac event . This project multicenter study recruit patient 6 emergency - cardiology department region Southern Denmark . The study commences September 2014 result project expect contribute risk stratification Non-cardiac chest pain patient .</brief_summary>
