	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , two part , study patient recurrent Head Neck Cancer ( HNC ) , opinion physician , satisfactorily treat surgery , radiation platinum chemotherapy . Part I drug dose-escalation , fix low fluency light application study determine drug dose safely give saturate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tumor . Part II light treatment dose-escalation , fix drug dose infusion study determine optimal light application , combination Part I drug dose , need achieve clinical response acceptable safety profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study RM-1929 Photoimmunotherapy Patients With Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photoimmunotherapy ( PIT ) new cancer target technology invented National Cancer Institute , USA . PIT utilizes monoclonal antibody conjugate dye ( abbreviated IR700 ) activate upon near-infrared light illumination induce rapid cell kill cell express antigen antibody bind cellular antigen . The requirement light-induced activation antigen-antibody binding induce cell kill enables selective destruction cancer cell minimum damage healthy tissue surround tumor cell . Photoimmunotherapy require two treatment step : ( ) administration drug infusion AND ( ii ) irradiation tumor 690 nm light use sufficient energy ( light fluence ) induce cell kill . Light irradiation typically apply 24 hour 72 hour post drug administration enable drug distribution within tumor . The experimental drug therapy , RM-1929 , injectable formulation consist chemical conjugate dye IR700 FDA approve antibody , Erbitux® ( Cetuximab ) , target EGFR antigen . EGFR highly express squamous cell carcinoma head neck , Erbitux® Photoimmunotherapy RM-1929 may result significant improvement clinically use treat HNC colorectal cancer . It expect systemic administration RM-1929 lead tumor accumulation RM-1929 binding EGFR express cancer cell . After RM-1929 administration , subsequent light irradiation induce rapid tumor destruction recurrent HNCs provide effective therapy manage disease . Preclinical pharmacology demonstrate light-induced activation RM-1929 elicit rapid tumor destruction human cancer xenograft implant mice progression free survival overall survival well quality life use exist standard care ( SOC ) approach . Part I study determine safety pharmacokinetics RM-1929 administered IV infusion use single low energy localize light irradiation . Upon identify optimal light fluence , Part II explore safety anecdotal efficacy associate repeat dose 4 treatment cycle patient display incomplete tumor response . Both part study document safety profile treatment cohort well pharmacokinetics RM-1929 . Preliminary efficacy outcome also record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients recurrent squamous carcinoma Head Neck , opinion treat physician , satisfactorily treat surgery , radiation , platinum chemotherapy . Diagnosis must confirm biopsy histopathology . 2 . Patient must receive prior systemic platinumbased chemotherapy treatment head neck cancer , unless opinion medical oncologist , use platinumbased chemotherapy contraindicate recommend , e.g. , renal impairment , allergy platinum compound , age , liver disease , myelosuppression , neuropathy , hearing loss , etc . 3 . Patients must life expectancy &gt; 6 month base investigator judgment . 4 . Male female patient least 18 year old . Female patient must pregnant breast feeding must practice medically acceptable form birth control , sterile , postmenopausal . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) define premenopausal woman capable become pregnant . This include woman postmenopausal least 12 month last menses . FCBP must agree use medically acceptable form birth control study least 6 month discontinuation Erbitux® study medication . Females must agree breast feed study least two month discontinuation Erbitux® study medication . Male patient use double barrier protection method medically acceptable form birth control study sterile . 5 . Patients must ECOG score 0 2 . 6 . Patient must understand investigational nature study sign Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approve write informed consent form prior receive study related procedure . 1 . Patients history significant Erbitux infusion reaction ( ≥ Grade 3 ) . 2 . Patients chemotherapy Erbitux® therapy radiation therapy within 4 week enrollment . 3 . Tumor invade major blood vessel ( carotid artery ) unless vessel embolized , stented surgically ligate prevent hemorrhage . 4 . Tumor clearly show CT scan clinically measurable . 5 . Location extension tumor precludes effective PIT . 6 . Patients impaired hepatic function ( ALP ( hepatic ) , AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 time upper normal limit , total serum bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL . 7 . Patients impairment renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL ) . 8 . Unwilling unable follow protocol requirement . 9 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion deem patient unsuitable candidate receive study drug . 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 11 . Patient require examination treatment within 4 week study drug administration would expose significant light , e.g. , eye examination , surgical procedure , endoscopy , etc .</criteria>
