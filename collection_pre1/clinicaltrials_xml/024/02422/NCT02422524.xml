	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single dose , open-label , sequential group study compare pharmacokinetics safety PA-824 subject mild , moderate , severe hepatic impairment match , non-hepatically impaired subject . This study enroll approximately 6 subject mild hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh A ) , approximately 6 subject moderate hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh B ) , approximately 6 subject severe hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh C ) , approximately 18 match non-hepatically impaired subject . Non-hepatically impaired subject control group match subject hepatic impairment base age ( +/- 10 year ) body weight ( +/- 20 % ) . Study Duration approximately 15 month . Primary objective : To evaluate pharmacokinetics single oral dose PA-824 subject mild , moderate , severe hepatic impairment ( assessed Child-Pugh score ) , relative match non-hepatically impaired subject . Secondary objective : To evaluate safety single oral dose PA-824 subject mild , moderate , severe hepatic impairment ( assessed Child-Pugh score ) , relative match non-hepatically impaired subject .</detailed_description>
