	<brief_summary>The Genomic Sequencing Childhood Risk Newborn Illness ( BabySeq Project ) research study explore use genomic sequencing newborn . The National Institutes Health funding study . The investigator enroll 240 healthy infant parent Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) Well Newborn Nursery 240 sick infant parent Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . A small blood sample collect infant genome sequencing may perform . Six week later , result return explained . Over 12 month investigator study experience parent pediatrician infant receive sequence help understand best use genomics pediatric care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective research protocol conduct pilot randomize clinical trial ass benefit risk add information genomic sequence report physician-mediated medical care newborn pediatric year . The investigator enroll 240 healthy infant parent Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) Well Newborn Nursery 240 sick infant parent Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . A small blood sample obtain enrolled infant . Samples collect infant enrol , regardless arm assign , order follow protocol subject prior randomization . Infants within cohort randomize ( 1:1 ) either standard-of-care ( family history standard newborn screen report ) standard-of-care plus genomic sequencing . A study physician genetic counselor disclose infant 's randomization assignment study result in-person consultation family . The study physician genetic counselor provide consultation family utilize available medical information . In sequence arm study , include medical history , physical exam , family history , standard newborn screen ( NBS ) report sequence report ( ) . In non-sequencing arm study , include medical history , physical exam , family history standard NBS report . Parents survey four point 12 month enrollment : baseline , immediately post-disclosure ( approximately 6 week enrollment ) , 3 month post-disclosure , 10 month post-disclosure .</detailed_description>
