	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) currently one standard diagnostic imaging method use diagnose tumor stage treatment Radiology Oncology Department . It also use check response radiation treatment . However , MRI n't traditionally use planning radiation treatment check treated tumor tissue change radiation treatment . The goal find possible benefit MRI image technique setting radiation treatment . Participating study would NOT change current treatment plan , allow investigator use MRI method research future patient care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol demonstrate proof concept feasibility new MRI hardware , pulse sequence data analysis software plan radiotherapy treatment assess tumor response radiotherapy ( FDA approve hardware allow study ) . Efforts develop , modify evaluate new exist MR image technique must continuous practice goal enhance use MRI radiation therapy . The investigator therefore anticipate ongoing need protocol believe ability perform study critical translation new image technology concept routine clinical use . Under protocol , modification follow item may test : pulse sequence program , radiofrequency coil , reconstruction processing software , MR system hardware analysis software . A brief description item describe . The potential risk associate modify item , measure take minimize risk describe subsequent section . Given perform MRI examination radiation therapy current standard care , change radiation treatment plan , radiotherapy delivery treatment recommendation guideline do base finding participant enter protocol .</detailed_description>
