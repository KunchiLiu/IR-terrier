	<detailed_description>The receptor activator NF-kB ligand ( RANKL ) system consider important bone homeostasis . RANKL exist three isoforms effect isoforms mediate bind specific receptor ( receptor activator NF-KB ( RANK ) ) . RANKL predominantly find transmembrane protein signal therefore dependent cell-cell interaction neighbour cell express RANK subsequently activate NFKB regulate cellular activation regulation cell cycle i.e proliferation , differentiation apoptosis . RANKL-RANK interaction modify osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , endogenous secrete protein bind RANKL inhibit signal . RANK/RANKL trigger network TRAF-mediated kinase cascade promote osteoclast differentiation . RANKL express osteoblast cell receptor , Rank , pre- osteoclastic cell . RANKL expression stimulate number factor , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-11 , IL-17 , TNF- α , vitamin D , Ca2+ , parathyroid , glucocorticoid , prostaglandin E2 , immunosuppressive drug , down-regulated TGF-α . The RANK/RANKL interaction induces differentiation formation multinucleated mature osteoclast , cause bone resorption . The third protein agonist , osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , also produce osteoblast know exert inhibitory effect pre-osteoclastic differentiation process . By bind RANKL also know osteoprotegerin bind protein ( OPGbp ) , OPG inhibit RANK/RANKL interaction subsequent osteoclastogenesis . OPG thus efficient anti-resorptive agent . It also serve decoy receptor tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) increase cell survival block apoptotic effect ligand . The fact overexpression OPG mouse result severe osteopetrosis OPG-null mouse osteoporotic testimony physiological importance OPG . The lack RANK RANKL induce osteopetrosis mouse . Thus , RANK/RANKL system vital activation bone resorping cell ( osteoclast ) . In skeleton bone synthesize cell ( osteoblast ) express RANKL signal RANK immature osteoclasts . This induce proliferation activation cell start proliferate resorp bone . OPG produce somatic cell bone production regulate sex hormone , TGF-B various substance . Today human make recombinant antibody RANKL , Denosumab use treat osteoporosis inhibits RANKL signal cause less bone resorption human . RANKL signal two known additional function healthy human involve lactation immune response . The investigator data show RANKL , RANK OPG express RNA protein level human testis . The Sertoli cell express RANKL , germ cell express RANK peritubular cell express OPG . Normally , RANKL activate NFKB activation pathway male gonad appear regulate whether testicular cell proliferate undergo apoptosis testis . The investigator ' vitro , ex vivo vivo data functional model support suggestion pathway appear therefore novel regulator germ cell proliferation . Decreased semen quality major factor male infertility . Semen quality indirect measure ability sperm accomplish fertilization . Evaluation male fertility potential evaluate semen analysis . Semen analysis evaluate certain characteristic common variable measure evaluate sperm quality : sperm count , motility morphology . There treatment men spermatozoa ejaculate even drug increase sperm number infertile men.Therefore , suggest antibody RANKL Denosumab , may use novel treatment option male infertility , highlight new indication Denosumab treatment . The investigator therefore test whether inhibition RANKL Denosumab humans increase sperm production semen quality small prospective intervention study . We invite 15 infertile men detail screen secure inclusion study completion anticipate 12 infertile men BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS All analyse perform accord Good Clinical Practice guideline primary analysis intention-to-treat population , include patient receive first dose medicine day 1 . We analyze data two way . The primary analysis proceed accord baseline value compare outcome variable intervention . The secondary analysis base stratify men accord subgroup analyse relation predefined primary secondary endpoint . Data analysis quality The primary end point protocol change sperm production evaluate total sperm number , sperm concentration follow number progressive motile sperm , morphologically normal sperm , sperm motility , progressive motility morfology compare paired t-test . Multiple secondary endpoint exist initial investigation focus change follow secondary endpoint : Sperm DFI , FSH , Inhibin B , serum OPG , RANKL , OPG , vitamin D calcium homeostasis . Subjects terminate participation visit day 1 visit day 180 include data analysis last day provide semen bloodsample . Men deliver semen sample occasionally miss data visit still include analysis . Men meet criterion protocol exclude analysis . Men fever 38.5 degree Celsius include analyse 3 month fever episode . Semen sample obtain abstinence period le 24 hour semen volume &lt; 1.5 ml include analysis . Those value carry forward analysis . A significance level 5 % use . For primary analysis Bonferronu-Holm p-value correction calculate additionally . For secondary analysis multiple test correction use . Instead result discuss view multiple testing situation . 1 . Analyses baseline versus different timepoints The first step compare change primary outcome baseline versus different timepoints . Spermatogenesis normally take 70 day men therefore determine difference individual timepoints calculate average day 80 , 120 180 compare baseline value determine effect RANKL inhibition whole length spermatogenesis . This analysis show significant difference group . For outcomes measure repeatedly , entail comparing estimate slope , rate change , outcome group . Mixed model allow correlation repeat observation baseline-day 1-day 80- day 180 man suitably incorporate parameter estimation . For endpoint measured baseline day 180 , pair t-tests used ass significant difference group determine whether mean change within group differs significantly zero . In case , data transform necessary meet model assumption . Afterwards , analysis conduct use multiple regression relevant confounders season , BMI , smoking , duration abstinence , time ejaculation motility assessment , fever etc . see change result For outcomes measure compare t-test parametric test day 1 , day 80 day 180 , group compare use non-parametric test Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test . For Binary outcome data compare two group mean conditional logistic-regression analysis adjustment relevant confounders ( define significantly p &lt; 0.05 associate ) . 2 . Analyses stratification subgroup Subjects group accord BMI , semen quality , serum RANKL , OPG , calcium , PTH , osteocalcin bonefactors evaluate day screening . The subgroup analyse accordance normal clinical practice stratification appropriate group accord clinical ( BMI &lt; 25 , 25-30 , &gt; 30 etc . ) , tertiles highest/lowest versus remain baseline . Analyses perform timpeoint compare baseline addition mean/median visit day 80 , 120 , 180 baseline mean/median visit intervention .</detailed_description>
