	<brief_title>Prospective Cohort , With Biobanking , Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) 20-30 % prevalent liver disorder Western society . Most patient NAFLD , mainly aspecific symptom ; generally silent progression simple steatosis NASH end liver-related morbidity mortality . Further insight factor contribute initiation NASH patient simple steatosis early diagnosis essential identifying future therapeutic option limit risk complicate NASH ( i.e . fibrosis , cirrhosis portal hypertension ) HCC , liver-related mortality extrahepatic morbidity . This cohort study , cross-sectional longitudinal part , include obese subject ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 , age 18-65 ) proven NAFLD base liver biopsy and/or MRI . All participant ask complete several questionnaire ( i.e . demographic , clinical data , SF-36 , GAD-7 PHQ-9 , FFQ , SQUASH , Baecke ) , undergo anthropometric measurement . Furthermore , blood , urine , faeces exhale air collect fibroscan DEXA-scan performed . Additionally , participant ask participate multi-sugar test intestinal permeability . The majority eligible subject undergo/have undergone MRI liver biopsy clinical reason . It expect 33 % subject ask undergo MRI study purpose . After 5 10 year , participant invite undergo study procedure , data sample collection study factor responsible development NASH group simple steatosis baseline , development ( extra ) hepatic complication group NASH baseline .</detailed_description>
