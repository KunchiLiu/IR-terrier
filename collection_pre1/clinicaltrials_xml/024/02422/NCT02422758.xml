	<brief_summary>Perioperative hypothermia bring numerous recognize postoperative complication . Active warm intraoperatively help maintain body temperature postoperative period , study Brazil , assess effect prewarming maintain normothermia . It believe prewarming force air warm system keep body temperature intra post-operative . This study aim evaluate effect prewarming maintain body temperature patient undergo elective surgery Gynecology specialty use force air warm system . The study experimental design , control type randomize clinical trial , simple blinding patient . Eighty adult patient undergo gynecological surgery art , surgical time least hour randomize allocated experimental group - prewarming system force air warm system 20 minute , control - Prewarming sheet blanket 20 minute . The patient keep warm anesthetic-surgical procedure . The measurement temperature use tympanic thermometer . Participants follow receive surgical center end surgery . Data record validated instrument . Data analysis use Model Linear Mixed Effects Structure Error Auto-Regressive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maintaining patient perioperative normothermia challenge surgical nursing staff . Despite advance development new technology prevention perioperative hypothermia , event still happen operate room health service To prevent patient 's body temperature loss , passive active cutaneous warm method use . Passive method prevent loss body heat heat transfer block , blanket , clothes cotton sheet ; however , evidence show although assist maintain body temperature , passive method alone effective . Active warm method effective keep perioperative normothermia . Among different technology available emphasize circulating water mattress , force air warm system carbon fiber resistive heating blanket . Based due lack research Brazilian reality effective measure prevention perioperative hypothermia , among , prewarming , find guided professional experience direct investment maintenance body temperature patient perioperative period , health service , justified conduct study .</detailed_description>
