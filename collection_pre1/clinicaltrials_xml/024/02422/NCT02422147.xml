	<detailed_description>Visit 1 participant consist go Informed Consent form talk patient study . If patient agrees participate , he/she ask sign form , copy give him/her his/her record . This conducted day endoscopic procedure participant anesthesia . The treatment provide standard-of-care offered patient pancreatic cyst lesion ( PCL ) interest undergoing EUS-guided ethanol ablation . An MRI abdomen obtain baseline measure determine size pancreatic cyst confirm diagnosis . Prior undertaking ablation , cyst fluid sample prior EUS session check mucin , viscosity , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) ( &gt; 200U/L=mucinous cyst ) , amylase require molecular marker analysis . Once PCL determine malignant potential patient select EUS-guided ablation . All patient receive dose intravenous ciprofloxacin 500mg 30 minute prior ablation . These evaluation treatment measure standard-of-care patient pancreatic cyst lesion undergo EUS-guided ethanol ablation . Procedural Technique : All procedure undertake use curvilinear echoendoscope . Once cyst identify ablation puncture use 22G needle . After subtotal evacuation cyst , injection perform volume alcohol equal quantity aspirate , cyst lavaged 3 5 minute , alternatively fill empty cavity . The injected ethanol evacuate end lavage , leave enough fluid outline cavity . A second ablative agent paclitaxel inject leave cyst cavity ; volume inject exceed volume aspirate fluid . The needle tip must carefully maintain within cyst avoid parenchymal injury cyst wall leak . At completion procedure , needle remove cyst cavity . When cyst restore original size ethanol injection , vigorous lavage aspiration must avoid probable communication main pancreatic duct . In patient multi-loculated cyst , single injection may provide sufficient drug delivery locule within cyst . It important determine optimal angle needle introduce maximum number target locule . When punctured locule visualize endosonographic image , needle passage across septation may indicate . The simultaneous collapse locule across septum cyst fluid evacuation spread echogenic bubble across septation injection ablative agent indication good distribution ablative agent locule . This important miss locule may result cyst regrowth treatment failure . While additional needle pass different angle may increase effectiveness cyst ablation also increase incidence adverse event . Therefore second needle puncture may consider risk adverse event appear low . The relative effectiveness procedure relate degree contact ablative agent cyst epithelium . However , important maintain needle visual plane within cyst cavity entire procedure . All technique describe standard-of-care treatment measure offer patient undergo EUS-guided ethanol ablation pancreatic cyst . Ablative agent : 1 . Ethanol : concentration 80-99 % may use . 2 . Paclitaxel : Because high viscosity cosolvent ( castor oil ) paclitaxel solution must dilute 1:1 0.9 % normal saline yield final dose concentration 3mg/mL . However , agent available less viscous format ( polymeric micelle ) use without dilution ( dose concentration 6mg/mL ) . Follow-up : 1 . Patients admit overnight observation keep nil mouth . A complete blood count serum amylase level check next day patient discharge home clinically well , evidence pancreatitis adverse event tolerate low fat diet . Patients prescribed oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg take twice day three day . This standard-of-care follow-up . 2 . A CT abdomen obtain 3 month assess treatment response . If change size cyst , CT scan schedule 3-month interval another attempt EUS-guided cyst ablation . If complete partial cyst resolution , follow-up CT scan obtain 6-month interval . If complete resolution document two CT scan , patient schedule annual CT scan . This standard-of-care follow-up . 3 . Patients persistent partial cyst resolution despite two ablative treatment session refer pancreatic surgeon consultation . If patient high-risk surgical candidate , surveillance EUS cross-sectional image continued per International Society Pancreatology guideline . This standard-of-care follow-up . 4 . Definitions : Using multi-detector CT scan specialize software original volume ( OV ) cyst calculate radiologist . Complete resolution define cyst nonvisible less 5 % OV follow-up CT ; Partial resolution cyst define decrease size 5-25 % OV cyst define Persistent &gt; 25 % OV .</detailed_description>
