	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Of High-Dose Systemic Methotrexate In Patients With Breast Cancer And Leptomeningeal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Management LMD patient metastatic breast cancer area unmet clinical need . Increased survival era hormonal HER2 direct therapy heighten need effective therapy late complication metastatic disease . Prognosis dismal median survival range 6-8 week untreated patient little improvement demonstrate past 20 year . Recently , renew interest systemic chemotherapeutic option patient . Incorporation systemic therapy standard treatment algorithm limit many agent show adequately penetrate blood brain barrier . High-dose methotrexate ( HD-MTX ) , however , unique penetrate blood brain barrier . In fact , evidence suggests may target area poor cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow , penetrate bulk disease , provide treatment systemic disease burden . Methotrexate drug know activity breast cancer use combination cyclophosphamide 5-fluorouracil part standard adjuvant treatment regimen . Currently , HD-MTX include NCCN Guidelines LMD use intermittently Johns Hopkins cancer center across nation LMD breast cancer . These recommendation , however , representative lack available therapy LMD oppose strong evidence-based data . Only two retrospective study suggest HD-MTX may effective option treat central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis , substantial methodological limitation . STUDY OBJECTIVE This phase II , prospective study evaluate systemic , intravenous high-dose methotrexate ( HD-MTX ) breast cancer patient leptomeningeal metastasis ( LMD ) . The primary objective determine treatment systemic intravenous HD-MTX result overall survival ( OS ) exceed 12 week among patient triple negative , HER2-positive , hormone refractory metastatic breast cancer patient LMD without parenchymal brain involvement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults ( male female ) age &gt; 18 Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) Performance Scale 01 ( see Appendix I ) Histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer follow subtype : TRIPLE NEGATIVE ( ERnegative , PRnegative , HER2negative disease ) . Triplenegative patient define per ASCOCAP Guidelines ( American Society Clinical OncologyCollege American Pathologists ) . HER2POSITIVE : HER2positive patient define per ASCOCAP Guidelines . HORMONE REFRACTORY : Patients ER/PRpositive disease accord ASCOCAP guideline may consider disease progression two line hormonal therapy ( administer adjuvant metastatic setting ) , deem clinically hormoneresistant take consideration rate progression disease short interval time first line hormonal therapy progression . Clinically hormoneresistant patient MUST also discuss Study Chair , Study coChair designee advance approval . NOTE : ASCOCAP guideline state ER PR assay consider positive least 1 % positive tumor nuclei sample test presence expect reactivity internal ( normal epithelial element ) external control . HER2positive define HER2 IHC 3+ , ISH ≥ 2.0 , average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signal . NOTE : A patient change receptor status ( e.g . PR negative positive ) may stratify triple negative hormone positive , contrary recent receptor testing , purpose study , base upon clinical course discretion Study Chair , Study coChair , designee advance approval . Cytologic unequivocal radiographic confirmation leptomeningeal metastasis dural puncture and/or neuroimaging without know brain metastasis Adequate organ function follow : Estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 70 cc/min ( calculate CockcroftGault formula ) White blood cell count &gt; 3000 cells/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 cells/mcL Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mcL Hematocrit &gt; 30 % Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 2.5x ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x ULN &lt; 5x ULN secondary liver metastasis Able provide confirm consent Prior allergy adverse reaction methotrexate New York Heart Association Heart Failure Class &gt; 3 ( see Appendix II ) Active diabetes insipidus Active mucositis Chemotherapy stereotactic radiotherapy within last 2 week Whole brain radiotherapy within last 6 month Prior treatment methotrexate contain systemic regimen within 1 year ( exclude intrathecal methotrexate ) Concurrent plan systemic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , new hormonal antiHER2 direct therapy direct management breast cancer ( exist antiHER2 therapy continue recently recommend National Consensus Guidelines Uncontrolled progressive systemic disease concurrent condition Investigator 's opinion make HDMTX undesirable treatment option patient would jeopardize compliance Contraindication MRI Use salicylates , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , sulfonamide medication within one week start methotrexate Pregnant woman woman breastfeed . Patients significant visceral fluid collection include ascites , pericardial effusion , pleural effusion others may experience delayed clearance methotrexate third space accumulation could result methotrexate toxicity inability tolerate propose study treatment . While absolute exclusion Study Chair coChairs contact discuss possible enrollment . Patients significant ascites define European Association Study Liver &gt; grade 2 , asymptomatic pleural effusion estimate size &gt; 200 mL , symptomatic pleural effusion size exclude .</criteria>
