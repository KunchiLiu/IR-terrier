	<detailed_description>Abstract : Complicating severe stag chronic venous insufficiency , venous leg ulcer common dermatology responsible important health care cost . Healing remains long many persistent case one year , despite compression local dressing . Several pharmacological study demonstrate benefit beta-blockers wound heal process : present skin , beta-adrenergic receptor play role wound heal . Their stimulation inhibits heal block promotes angiogenesis , fibroblast migration keratinocyte migration . Using topical timolol several patient seem confirm effect : ulcer treat timolol heal week whereas evolve local care compression . The purpose study demonstrate whether interest topical timolol venous leg ulcer combination compression wound dressing versus placebo . The primary endpoint evaluate heal rate W12 . The effect evaluate photography , evaluation surface ulcer W12 compare W0 . The research side effect also evaluate .</detailed_description>
