	<brief_summary>Inherited thrombocytopenias heterogeneous group disorder characterize reduced number blood platelet consequent bleed tendency range mild life-threatening . Thrombocytopenia cause genetic mutation therefore present throughout patient ' life transmit progeny . Some patient severely reduced platelet count present spontaneous bleeding , represent major clinical problem : fact , bleed diathesis expose subject risk severe hemorrhage , affect quality life often require hospitalization and/or transfusion . Conversely , patient inherit thrombocytopenias absent mild spontaneous bleeding tendency . However , even patient risk major bleeding occasion surgery invasive procedure . Therefore , potential hemorrhage occasion invasive procedure represent clinical problem patient affect inherited thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag drug , available tablet , stimulate production platelet bone marrow . A previous study demonstrate short course eltrombopag effective increase platelet count patient MYH9-related disease ( MYH9-RD ) , one form inherit thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag give 3 6 week 12 patient MYH9-RD platelet count low 50 x10e9/L . Eleven patient respond drug 8 obtain platelet count high 100 x109/L three time baseline value . Remission spontaneous bleed achieve 8 10 patient treatment well tolerated case . Based finding , short-term eltrombopag course successfully use prepare major surgery two patient MYH9-RD le 20 x10e9 platelets/L . The present study two main objective . - To verify eltrombopag effective transiently increase platelet count 100 x 109/L abolish bleeding tendency patient different form inherit thrombocytopenia . To end , eltrombopag give 3-6 week patient different form inherit thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag administer dosage 50 mg/day 3 week . After 3 week treatment , patient obtain platelet count high 100 x10e9/L stop therapy . The patient achieve platelet count low 100 x10e9/L treat eltrombopag high dosage ( 75 mg/day ) 3 additional week . This treatment schedule call `` Phase 1 '' study . If study achieve goal , short-term eltrombopag could potentially used future prepare patient surgery invasive procedure - To verify eltrombopag use stably reduce spontaneous bleeding tendency long periods time patient clinically significant spontaneous bleeding . To end , patient clinically significant spontaneous bleeding bleed tendency reduce Phase 1 study without severe side effect , admit `` Phase 2 '' study . During Phase 2 , patient treat eltrombopag 16 week . In order determine low dose eltrombopag able reduce abolish bleeding tendency , patient start treatment eltrombopag 25 mg/day 4 week . Then , every 4 week , patient re-evaluated dosage eltrombopag adjust accord bleeding tendency 7 day evaluation . The dosage eltrombopag use Phase 2 range 12.5 75 mg/day . Other objective study : - evaluate safety tolerability Eltrombopag patient inherit thrombocytopenia . - identify dosage Eltrombopag require obtain objective Phases 1 2 . - study effect treatment laboratory parameter related platelet production function . All patient undergo follow-up visit 30 day completion treatment . Patients treat outpatient . The evaluation patient enrollment include : medical history ; physical examination ; peripheral blood examination count blood cell , examine blood cell microscope , measure parameter related liver/kidney function platelet production ; standard urine analysis ; ophthalmic assessment . Studies dose adjustment include examination perform enrollment exception ophthalmic assessment . Evaluation patient end Phases 1 2 30 day end treatment include examination perform enrollment : moreover , patient obtain platelet count high 100 x10e9/L , vitro platelet function study .</brief_summary>

ITGA2B/ITGB3related thrombocytopenia ( OMIM available ) . ANKRD26related thrombocytopenia ( OMIM 188000 ) . TUBB1related thrombocytopenia ( OMIM available ) ACTN1related thrombocytopenia ( OMIM available ) GFI1Brelated thrombocytopenia ( OMIM available ) Patients fulfill follow criterion : Age ≥ 16 year ≤ 70 year Average platelet count previous year less 80 x109/L Written inform consent Phase 2 Patients clinically relevant chronic recurrent bleeding baseline ( grade 24 WHO bleed scale ) : ( ) complete phase 1 without severe side effect ( ii ) obtain reduction remission bleed Eltrombopag administration . Phases 1 2 Hypersensitivity Eltrombopag one excipients . History thromboembolic event . Treatment antiplatelet drug drug affect platelet function and/or anticoagulant . Concurrent disease condition significantly increase risk thromboembolic event . Moderate severe liver failure ( ChildPugh score ≥ 5 ) . Altered renal function define creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL Previous concurrent clonal disorder myeloid series ( acute myeloid leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome ) . Females pregnant nursing ( negative pregnancy test require enrolment fertile woman ) . Formal refusal recommendation safe contraception . Alcohol drug addiction . Any disease condition advice responsible physician would make treatment dangerous patient would make patient ineligible study , include physical , psychiatric , social behavioral problem .</criteria>
