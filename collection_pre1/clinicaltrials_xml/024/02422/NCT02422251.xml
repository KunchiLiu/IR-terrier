	<brief_summary>The aim project compare biomechanics three different bear design use total knee replacement ( TKR ) implant . The bearing part middle knee implant allow metal tray attach shin bone ( tibia ) move relation metal part attach thigh bone ( femur ) usually make plastic ( high density polyethylene ) . There three different bear type study , give different movement . This study see bear like natural knee design give best function feeling patient TKR . 90 TKR patient Golden Jubilee National Hospital recruit randomise receive one three study bearing ( 30 group ) . In addition , control group 30 healthy individual similar age recruit comparison . Before surgery 4 8 week 1 year operation patient attend biomechanical assessment session University Strathclyde . The control group attend assessment session . In session carry number everyday task walk , move sit stand go stair . These task measure use motion capture technique . Reflective marker place participant tracked camera movement record . Force plat floor record force task . Movement force data analyse see difference exist group show bear give natural movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomechanical Assessment High Congruency Knee Bearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind randomise control trial . The aim study compare biomechanical performance knee replacement different bearing design native natural knee . The hypothesis mobile bearing design high congruency bear allow knee replacement work like native knee give natural movement carry everyday task . The current evidence whether fix mobile , low high congruency bearing give natural movement provide good knee function sparse . By carry randomise controlled trial include cohort healthy individual take indepth functional assessment number different common activity daily live possible show level functional outcome three bearing use give . Ninety patient schedule total knee arthroplasty care four consultant orthopaedic surgeon Golden Jubilee National Hospital meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit randomise one three study group ( low congruency fix bearing , high congruency fix bear high congruency mobile bear ) . Invitation letter participant information sheet send suitable patient prior preoperative consultation . They approach consultation visit seek consent take part study . At time give opportunity ask question study . Following write consent , patient randomise use sequentially number opaque seal envelope . A nominated person , independent approach consent patient , sign open envelope inform hospital research team randomisation . The patient university research team blind randomisation . For patient arrangement make preoperative movement analysis test session . Subsequently , surgery rehabilitation prior discharge accord standard hospital practice . Participants return hospital standard follow appointment six week one year . At time arrangement make attend follow movement analysis session . Clinical data record preoperative assessment postoperative follow appointment , range movement , Oxford Knee Score , patient satisfaction , EQ5D radiographic measurement collect study patient compare functional outcome measure movement analysis session . Participants ask attend movement analysis test session University Strathclyde Glasgow three separate occasion ; preoperatively , 4 8 week postoperatively one year postoperatively . Each session follow procedure . Prior data collection , participant ask change tight fit short vest top provide ( male participant ask forego vest top ) changing room within laboratory facility . Measurements weight body dimension take ( required processing data ) reflective marker attach leg , pelvis , torso arm . These attach use toupee tape elasticated strap require . They ask wear headband ( provide ) another four marker attach head . There eight activity daily live ( ADLs ) test protocol , carry one two laboratory ; one standard motion capture laboratory ( S ) laboratory CAREN system ( Motek Medical , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) consist virtual reality screen , move platform treadmill ( M ) . The ADLs : 1 . Level walk straight line ( S ) 2 . Level walk along curve pathway ( S ) 3 . Sit stand sit ( S ) 4 . Sit stand walk ( S ) 5 . Ascending descend stair ( S ) 6 . Getting car ( S ) 7 . Single leg balance ( M ) 8 . Walking incline ( M ) Participants ask perform ADL fix order several time three good set data collect . Participants give instruction perform ADL prior perform ask practice data collect . During demand task , participant support harness prevent fall hand rail provide test staircase . Participants allow rest break ADL test require . At end task participant ask set question find perform task . On completion test protocol , marker remove , participant get change free leave . It expect test session last 4 hour . The three good data set average reduce variability . Statistical analysis carry use appropriate statistical package determine significant difference exist data three patient group patient group control group . All data test parametricity . Parametric data analyse use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) test post hoc Bonferroni correction . If data find nonparametric , KruskalWallis test use . For data time appropriate repeat measure analysis use . A 95 % confidence level use throughout . The study fund three year period . The first year involve set development protocol recruitment control participant . It hop recruitment patient start nine month study period take 25 month complete data collection analysis . This allow two month report study .</detailed_description>
