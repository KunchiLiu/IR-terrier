	<brief_summary>The overall aim project investigate healing process human tendon suturing rupture Achilles tendon , specifically determine optimal load pattern tendon rehabilitation period ensure complete good recovery tendon structure function . The investigator hypothesize restrict early weight bear allow passive stretch early phase tendon heal ensure good tissue regeneration thereby prevent chronic tendon elongation improve tendon tissue recovery clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical repair Achilles tendon rupture know significantly reduce risk re-rupture accelerate time return activity compare non-surgical treatment ( 1 , 2 ) . Although sutured , Achilles tendon rupture require extended rehabilitation period follow surgery function normally . However , currently available information post-operative treatment suggest currently available rehabilitation guideline , include early weight bearing , accomplish optimal recovery muscle-tendon function . It demonstrate reduced capacity perform heel-rises , diminish range motion ankle joint , reduce calf muscle mass correlate delay return activity , factor could relate elongation heal tendon ( 3 ) . Importantly , appear prevent tendon elongation rehabilitation improve clinical outcome , actual mechanism elongation thus prevent remain unknown ( 4 ) . With newly develop technique laboratory determine mechanical property human whole Achilles tendon , vivo , make possible explore tendon respond regime follow suture repair rehabilitation regime . In contrast current rehabilitation regime tendon surgery , include early high loading ( weight bearing ) already first week surgery , hypothesize avoid early weight bear allow early passive ankle joint range motion ( tissue strain minimal loading ) prevent chronic tendon elongation , increase tendon stiffness , increase calf strength muscle volume/thickness , thus improve long-term clinical outcome tendon rupture human . Patients acute Achilles tendon rupture undergo standardized suture repair ( a.m. Kessler ) use resorbable suture ( Vicryl size 1 ) Bispebjerg Hospital place brace inhibits ankle joint movement . During surgery , patient get four tantalum bead diameter 1.0 mm implant venflon needle proximal distal stub tendon . Thereafter randomize three post-operative treatment regime : Control , range motion immobilize From currently available data ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) suggest brace worn 6 week surgery three group present experiment . The control group allow partial weight-bearing day 0 full weight-bearing week 4 , toe rise 16 week , jog 24 week return sport 34 week . The two delay weight-bearing group ( range motion group immobilize group ) restrict completely weight-bearing initially ( 6 week ) , allow partial weight-bearing 6 week full weight-bearing 8 week .</detailed_description>
