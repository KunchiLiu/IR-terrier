	<brief_title>Colonoscopy Quality Assurance With Focus Key Quality Indicators Patient Satisfaction Aalborg University Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study part complete Colonoscopy program begin April 2015 . The full program follow : Colonoscopy North Jutland Surgical Departments A quality assurance research project focus key quality indicator , patient satisfaction colonoscopy training . Introduction Population screen colorectal cancer introduce Denmark 2014 lead substantially increase demand endoscopy unit , typically base surgical department . Colonoscopy effective detecting cancer early stage even prevent cancer removal premalignant polyp . A prerequisite effect high quality endoscopy service low incidence complication miss cancer . Another important aspect compliance within target population . This also largely dependent quality colonoscopy include minimal discomfort perception endoscopy staff competent , knowledgeable , friendly courteous . In reality little known quality colonoscopy Denmark region North Jutland . There systematic collection quality data national regional level , endoscopy unit level individual surgeon level . Data population screen programme cover potential point , much detail data acquisition necessary order ascertain service international standard . This theoretical interest , endoscopy service quality lack thereof determine screen programme effective whether actually detrimental population . Prior implementation population screen United Kingdom colonoscopy quality survey carry . The result appal , low completion rate many complication , lead nationwide quality improvement programme , include systematic data monitor comprehensive training effort . All NHS endoscopy provider invite participate regular feedback quality data endoscopy service level individual colonoscopist 's level . This lead marked improvement overall quality . In region investigator intuitive belief general endoscopy quality good , although endoscopists would preferable others case u refer colonoscopy . The investigator also perceive endoscopists good teacher others , reality evidence assumption . Traditionally little attention pay colonoscopy training country oppose teach-ing type surgical skill . Colonoscopy potentially unpleasant procedure usually carry minimal sedation , carry risk rare serious complication even death . There ample evidence part learn curve move away patient train virtual reality simulator , mandatory surgical education Denmark . In region two endoscopy simulator course provide free charge . Some training , how-ever , must necessarily undertake clinical setting . The literature suggest competency achieve trainee perform 200 procedure . In Danish surgical curriculum , demand specify number procedure without supervision , colonoscopy competency must vouch supervisor programme director end specialty training . Teaching colonoscopy difficult time consume . Most experienced colonoscopists unable give detailed guidance without actually take procedure trainee perform-ance colonoscopy become largely `` automate '' `` unconsciously competent '' year . It follow necessary foundation effective high quality training faculty trainer ( experienced colonoscopists ) receive train trainer , aware quality performance , agree criterion high quality colonoscopy . In educational quality assurance research project investigator wish focus quality data quality training wherever possible take patient ' perspective account inquiry patient satisfaction aspect . Method 1 . Quality colonoscopy Quality data acquisition - The investigator wish implement nurse assess patient comfort score - The investigator wish explore patient satisfaction colonoscopy service questionnaires possible link result quality parameter - The investigator wish gather retrospective epidemiological data regard miss cancer serious complication basis future comparison . This cooperation clinical epidemiology service - The investigator wish implement IT system enable automate capture select quality parameter directly colonoscopy note . This facilitate regular feedback unit individual level decide later date . It also provide reliable basis research Quality parameter colonoscopy registered site include completeness ( percentage examination coecum reach ) , adenoma detection rate , use sedative analgesic , time per colonoscopy patient comfort score . In previous yet publish study , one investigator validate patient questionnaire detail information colonoscopy experience , may also use . Serious complication bleed perforation must also note , fortunately rare . Ultimately close zero rate miss cancer ( cancer occur 6 36 month colonoscopy ) important quality indicator , information obtain search national register data . 2 . Quality teach learn • Determining base line technical quality colonoscopy . In order establish baseline inform educational activity investigator wish assess surgeon nurse colonoscopists technical performance ( Miller 's level 3 4 - show ) basic knowledge ( Miller 's level 1 ) . The technical performance assess two way . One , perform 3 case endoscopy simulator utilizing inbuilt feedback data direct observation ( aid DOPS assessment tool develop The Joint Advisory Group GI Endoscopy , Royal College Physicians Great Britain ) . Two , perform two live colonoscopy assess two faculty use DOPS assessment tool . The basic knowledge test MCQ originally develop nurse colonoscopists . On basis assessment benchmarks novice , intermediate , proficient expert decide . If possible investigator also wish use novel assessment tool base automatic registration time movement scope-guide system compare DOPS simulator data . It may also possible correlate technical data patient ' feedback . • Train trainer As described introduction local faculty colonoscopy educator receive training trainer , aware quality performance , agree criterion high quality colonoscopy prerequisite successful training programme . Some trainer key mover behind highly successful British quality improvement process agree teach faculty . They already knowledge colonoscopy training ( lack ) Scandinavian country teach course Oslo Mid Jutland Region Denmark . The course consist three separate day precede even theoretical session . Day one deal basic technical aspect colonoscopy . Day two deal polypectomy day three teach aspect i.e . teach trainees peer . There three teacher day 6 participant , experience colonoscopists three surgical department region . The course consist mainly hand teach training , also video-linked teach session lead one teacher . The participant ask register quality data course . The participant function colonoscopy supervisor intervention train programme • Training programme Other study demonstrate marked improvement acquisition surgical skill module base programme , theoretical aspect simulate skill train deliver shortly prior intensive training period example 6 8 week trainee schedule perform high number supervise similar procedure i.e . herniotomies laparoscopic cholecystectomy . ( CG Carlsen , PhD dissertation : Fast-track training improve surgical skill compare traditional training , 2013 ) . Intuitively also effective colonoscopy training . The investigator wish deliver module base colonoscopy train programme surgical trainee ( PGY1 , 2 3 - Danish equivalent : introduktionsstilling , hoveduddannelse 1 , 2 ) . The programme consist theoretical session , two day simulator course aim basic scope handle number day ' clinical training . 3 day ' supervised training ( supervisor present colonoscopy room ) - approximately twenty colonoscopy . And 6 day ' possibility supervision short notice - approximately 50 colonoscopy . The supervisor participate train trainer programme . All trainee give information prior experience colonoscopy . The investigator determine learn curve DOPS assessment 20 50 colonoscopy rank previously agree benchmarking framework . The investigator interested note learn curve differ accord trainee start point . I.e . high initial score indicate training programme unnecessary . 3 . The patient ' perspective The investigator wish explore patient ' perception colonoscopy nurse assess comfort score questionnaire deal aspect communication , safety , comfort , ultimately patient ' willingness return repeat colonoscopy deem necessary . The investigator would like see parameter correlate observed technical quality . 4 . Epidemiological data The investigator wish collaborate clinical epidemiology service provide retrospective data miss cancer ( colorectal cancer diagnose 6 36 month colonoscopy ) serious adverse event , readmission death .</detailed_description>
