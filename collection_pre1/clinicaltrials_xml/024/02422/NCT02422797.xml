	<brief_summary>The aim study determine virologically suppress , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infect adults antiretroviral regimen ( include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTIs ] plus third agent ) remain suppressed upon switch two-drug regimen dolutegravir ( DTG ) + rilpivirine ( RPV ) . The study primarily assess non-inferiority antiviral activity switch DTG + RPV daily compare continuation current antiretroviral regimen ( CAR ) Week 48 switch visit eligible subject CAR group initiate DTG + RPV therapy Week 52 . CAR include 2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor ( INI ) , 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , 1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) . The study include 148-week open-label treatment phase , comprise Early Switch Phase ( Day 1 Week 52 ) Late Switch Phase ( Week 52 Week 148 ) . The participant fulfil study eligibility criterion participate Early Switch Phase either switch CAR DTG + RPV , continue take CAR , Week 52 . At end Early Switch Phase , eligible participant proceed Late Switch Phase participant DTG + RPV CAR treatment group receive DTG + RPV therapy Week 148 . After Week 148 , subject may eligible continue receive DTG +RPV Continuation Phase . The study plan conduct approximately 476 participant .</brief_summary>

HIV1 infect men woman &gt; =18 year age . Must uninterrupted current regimen ( either initial second combination antiretroviral therapy [ cART ] regimen ) least 6 month prior screen ; Any prior switch , define change single drug multiple drug simultaneously , must occur due tolerability and/or safety concern access medication , convenience/simplification . Acceptable stable cART regimens prior screen include 2 NRTIs plus INI ( either initial second cART regimen ) , NNRTI ( either initial second cART regimen ) , Boosted PI ( atazanavir unboosted ) ( either initial second PIbased cART regimen ) . Documented evidence least two plasma HIV1 RNA measurement &lt; 50 c/mL 12 month prior Screening : one within 6 12 month window , one within 6 month prior Screening ; Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL Screening ; A female may eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential either define postmenopausal ( 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea &gt; =45 year age ) physically incapable become pregnant document tubal ligation , hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , Childbearing potential negative pregnancy test Screening Day 1 agrees use one follow method contraception avoid pregnancy : Complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration study drug , throughout study , least 2 week discontinuation study medication ; Male condom/spermicide , male condom/diaphragm , diaphragm/spermicide ; Any intrauterine device publish data show expected failure rate &lt; 1 % per year ; Male partner sterilization prior female participant 's entry study male sole partner participant ; Approved hormonal contraception participant randomly assign DTG + RPV arm approve hormonal contraception plus barrier method participant assign CAR ; Any method publish data show expected failure rate &lt; 1 % per year . Any contraception method must use consistently , accordance approve product label treatment study drug least 2 week discontinuation study drug . All participant participate study counsel safe sexual practice include use benefit/risk effective barrier method ( e.g. , male condom ) risk HIV transmission uninfected partner . Participants willing able understand requirement study participation provide sign dated write informed consent prior screen . For participant enrol France : participant eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Exclusionary Criteria prior screen Day 1 Within 6 month prior Screening confirm suppression &lt; 50 c/mL current ART regimen , plasma HIV1 RNA measurement &gt; =50 c/mL . Within 6 12 month window prior screen confirm suppression &lt; 50 c/mL , plasma HIV1 RNA measurement &gt; 200 c/mL . Within 6 12 month window prior screen confirm suppression &lt; 50 c/mL , 2 plasma HIV1 RNA measurement &gt; =50 c/mL . Any drug holiday window initiate first HIV Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) 6 month prior screen , except brief period ( less 1 month ) ART stop due tolerability and/or safety concern . Any switch second line regimen , define change single drug multiple drug simultaneously , due virologic failure therapy ( define confirm plasma HIV 1 RNA measurement &gt; =400 c/mL initial suppression &lt; 50 c/mL first line HIV therapy regimen ) .
