	<brief_summary>Widespread food insecurity malnutrition largely main impairing factor human capital development Pakistan . Rates chronic malnutrition high , acute malnutrition critical : 44 % child five stunt nationwide global acute malnutrition ( GAM ) rate amongst child five exceed WHO critical threshold 15 % . Nutritional status trend also show deteriorate situation since 1994 , stunt rate 36 % . This study evaluate effectiveness food base intervention prevent stunt among child under-five year focus window opportunity ( 1000 day conception 2 year ) address stunt . Pregnant woman , lactate mother child 6-59 month receive supplement monthly basis intervention area , participant control area receive routine public health service available study area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stunting Prevention Project Thatta Sajawal Districts , Sindh Province , Pakistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children two consume less half daily energy requirement ( 560 kcal ) low recommend level micronutrient ( one-third reference nutrient intake Iron one-half Zinc ) . Overall , less 4 % child receive acceptable , diverse diet . Food security nutrition situation Sindh province even dramatic . According National Nutrition Survey , 2011 , GAM prevalence exceed 18 % anemia level amongst child five reach alarm level 72.5 % . With high level poverty food insecurity , food base approach prevent stunting , together non- food base approach need . Therefore , Division Women Child Health , Aga Khan University propose research study strong evidence base effectiveness preventive food/nutrient base intervention reduction stunt develop viable programme nutrition `` real '' operational condition . The effectiveness project measure term impact propose intervention stunt micronutrient deficiency prevalence target group ( child mother ) . Given condition project implementation , quasi-experimental `` double difference '' design would appropriate assess impact intervention . We propose compare intervention non-intervention ( control ) group ( first difference ) intervention ( second difference ) . Then , operational implementation research comprise baseline end line survey . In addition , nested cluster randomize control trial implement track evolution key variable relate quality intervention delivery intermediate nutrition outcome . The control cluster receive routine public private health service available area . To achieve purpose objective project design include core intervention complementary feed use food/nutrient base supplement along behavior change communication , complement non-food intervention . Using preventative ( blanket ) approach , three type food/nutrient supplement ( Wawamum , MNP &amp; WSB ) consider part intervention .</detailed_description>
