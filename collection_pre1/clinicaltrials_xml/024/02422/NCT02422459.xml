	<brief_title>Chronic Pain Self-management Support With Pain Education Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : This study test hypothesis participant chronic pain experience great change function ChrOnic pain self-ManageMent support pain science EducatioN exerCisE ( COMMENCE ) comparison wait-list control . Secondary objective # 1 : This study test hypotheses people chronic pain experience great change pain intensity , pain interference , self-efficacy , catastrophic thinking , fear movement/re-injury , pain neurophysiology knowledge , much participant bother difficulty functional activity , fatigue , depressive symptom , health care utilization work status COMMENCE comparison wait-list control . Secondary objective # 2 : This study identify demographic , psychological , psychophysical variable predictive treatment response . Design : This study randomize trial parallel group , wait-list control balance randomization . A cross-over take place 12-week follow-up assessment ( ie . group initially receive treatment receive treatment group initially wait-list receive treatment 6 week ) . The group comparison perform use data 12-week follow-up due anticipate carry-over effect self-management support . Data collect cross-over use help identify factor predict response intervention . Blinding : Due nature treatment comparison , participant treat physiotherapist blind . The assessor complete two objective measure blind treatment allocation . Data analysis perform someone blind group allocation . Setting : 110 participant chronic pain recruit Woodstock Area Community Health Centre ( WACHC ) Woodstock , Ontario , Canada . WACHC interdisciplinary team health care provider provide care priority population Oxford County , Ontario , Canada . The priority population include people follow barrier access health care : addiction concern , mental health challenge , low income , lack health insurance , isolated senior . The investigator expect sample represent marginalize population people chronic often exclude chronic pain treatment research barrier access health care . Sample Size : The sample size necessary randomize control trial three repeat measure 0 , 7 18 week calculate use online sample size software ( GLIMMPSE 2.0 ) . The calculation perform use significance level 0.05 , power 0.8 , minimum detectable mean difference group 10 point Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Dysfunction Index ( SMFA-DI ) 7 week 18 week , standard deviation 23 point SMFA-DI base clinical data WACHC . The needed sample size calculate 88 participant . To account potential 20 % drop-out rate , 110 participant recruit Allocation : The allocation sequence generate study investigator involve enrolment participant assign intervention . A computer-generated blocked random number schedule use determine allocation sequence . The block size unknown study investigator . The allocation sequence conceal use sequentially number , opaque envelope , open initial assessment . Co-intervention : Participants free continue treatment . Other treatment record self-report assessment time-point analyze group difference . Withdrawing Participants Study : Participants may withdraw treatment time . Participants choose withdraw document data analyzed member group randomly assign ( intention-to-treat ) Potential prognostic indicator predictor response : Potential predictor response secondary objective # 2 include baseline measure outcome measure list outcomes well post-traumatic stress measure Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist , sense perceive injustice measure Injustice Experience Questionnaire , number medication , comorbidities measure disease count , expectation recovery . Expectations recovery assess two question : ) Do think pain improve ? ii ) Do think functional ability improve ? Demographic information : The follow information collect initial assessment analyze potential covariates predictor response : age , sex , work status prior symptom onset , length time since symptom onset month , diagnosis provide medical professional report patient , medication use , previous treatment receive , expectation recovery . Treatment fidelity : Treatment fidelity assess combination attendance ( categorize &lt; 25 % , 25-49 % , 50-74 % , â‰¥75 % visit ) adherence self-management strategy . This measured clinician report clinician review workbook individual treatment session . Data monitoring auditing : This trial include data monitor committee audit outside study investigator Analysis : Statistical analysis conduct use Stata software , version 13 ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas , USA ) . Baseline characteristic treatment wait-list group compare use Student 's t-test continuous data Chi square Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . Analysis primary objective secondary objective # 1 perform use linear mixed-effects model data three repeat measure ( baseline , 7 week , 18 week ) . A p value le 0.05 consider indicative statistical significance . The primary analysis use intention treat principle , secondary analysis investigate efficacy complete 75 % visit perform well ( per protocol analysis ) . Predictors response ( change SMFA-DI ) determine use series multiple regression model .</detailed_description>
