	<detailed_description>EGFR tyrosine kinase mutation frequently see NSCLC , especially adenocarcinoma.1 The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) receptor tyrosine kinase ( TKs ) regulate many developmental , metabolic physiological process . In tumor cell , TK activity EGFR may dysregulated several mechanism , include EGFR gene mutation , increase gene copy number EGFR protein overexpression.1 Improper activation EGFR TK result increase malignant cell survival , proliferation , invasion metastasis . EGFR overexpression observe tumor 60 % patient metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) correlate poor prognosis.2 Treatment reversible EGFR TK inhibitor ( TKIs ) , gefitinib erlotinib , result dramatic antitumor activity subset patient NSCLC . Sequencing EGFR gene reveal majority tumor respond EGFR TKIs harbor mutation TK domain EGFR . For patient whose tumor exhibit EGFR mutation , response rate gefitinib erlotinib approximately 75 % , suggest mutation , least part , drive malignant transformation . However , disease-free time progression still less 1 year study.3-5 More half patient acquire resistant new EGFR T790M resistance mutation . A second biopsy time progression become issue . However , Only around 30 % NSCLC patient receive gene test predict target therapy response risk difficulty obtain adequate tissue primary lung tumor biopsy . Serial monitoring emergence resistant mutation almost possible . Recently , circulate free DNAs ( cfDNAs ) become promising topic cancer research . cfDNA use liquid biopsy , allow repeat blood sample take change mutation status track throughout cancer treatment , pave way potential use follow treatment response , gauge prognosis , monitor recurrence.6 It know hundred year disseminate tumor cell find circulation patient metastatic cancer hypothesize circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) may represent cancer stem cell high metastatic potential cellular population.7 The major challenge since one CTC may find background 105-106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells.8 CTCs attractive alternative tumor tissue biomarker analysis include EGFR mutation . CTCs obtain routine blood draw minimal risk inconvenience patient compare fresh biopsy . Another appeal facet CTCs surrogate diagnostic tissue idea CTCs could also constitute `` liquid biopsy '' like cfDNA provide real-time information patient 's current disease state.9,10 Analysis biomarker status CTCs collect prior treatment could potentially use select appropriate target therapy , repeat longitudinal sampling treatment could use detect appearance resistance marker potentially enable switch appropriate therapy . A side-by-side comparison EGFR mutation analysis DNA extract circulate tumour cell ( CTCs ) versus cfDNA plasma suggest mutational analysis CTCs capture CellSearch platform low comparison frequency EGFR mutation identify plasma.11 However , limitation might relate CellSearch platform used,11 CTC platform ( eg , CTC biochip ) great sensitivity specificity EGFR mutational analyses.12 New technology , next generation sequence digital PCR ( Figure 1 ) , permit precise quantification cfDNA also CTCs , offer opportunity design appropriate treatment . Longitudinal analysis EGFR mutation cfDNA CTCs might well prove ideal non-invasive technique include oncologist 's repertoire time assign monitoring treatment patient NSCLC . In study , investigator collect blood NSCLC patient harbor EGFR mutation biopsy specimen . Buffy coat serum/plasma separate DNA extract . The investigator check EGFR mutation next generation sequence digital PCR . Blood volunteer without lung cancer patient also collect standard . Serial follow-up change EGFR mutation every month cancer patient correlate clinical course . The Investigators hope detection EGFR mutation serial change patient blood could offer marker early diagnosis early relapse .</detailed_description>
