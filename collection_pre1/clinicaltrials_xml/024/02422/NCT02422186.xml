	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Intranasal Esketamine Plus Oral Antidepressant Elderly Participants With Treatment-resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , active-controlled , multicenter study ( 1 study site ) elderly participant TRD ass efficacy , safety , tolerability flexible dos intranasal esketamine plus newly initiate oral antidepressant compare newly initiate oral antidepressant ( active comparator ) plus intranasal placebo . The study consist 3 phase : Screening/Prospective Observational Phase ( 4 7 week ) , Double-blind induction Phase ( 4 week ) , Follow Phase ( 2 week ) . Participants rollover long-term open-label safety study participate Follow-up Phase . At start Screening/Prospective observational Phase , participant must document nonresponse least one antidepressant treatment ( base Massachusetts General Hospital - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [ MGH-ATRQ ] criterion ) current episode depression , participant take different oral antidepressant treatment MGH-ATRQ least previous 2 week minimum therapeutic dose . This antidepressant treatment discontinue prior double-blind induction Phase . Participants take benzodiazepine ( dosage equal less equivalent 6 mg/day lorazepam ) and/or permit non-benzodiazepine sleep medication ( example , zolpidem , zaleplon ) screening/prospective observational phase continue medication . All participant start first dose ( Day 1 28 milligram [ mg ] ) ; second dose ( Day 4 ) either 28 56 mg. All subsequent dos may 28 , 56 84 mg. After first dose , dose decision determine investigator base efficacy tolerability . In addition , participant assign receive 1 4 oral antidepressant medication 2 different class antidepressant treatment , Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ) ( escitalopram sertraline ) Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor ( SNRI ) [ duloxetine venlafaxine extend release ( XR ) ] , initiate Day 1 continue double-blind induction Phase . Participants primarily evaluate improvement depressive symptom assess change Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score Week 4 . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
