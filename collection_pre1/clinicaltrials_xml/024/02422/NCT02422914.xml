	<brief_summary>Background . Smoking consider global public health problem . For reason , smoke dependence call expert global epidemic . Over past three year , electronic device ( Tobacco Free Cigarettes , TFC ) important expansion many country . Nevertheless , poor evidence TFC beneficial smoking cessation . In particular , even though proved nicotine replacement device help many individual give smoke tolerate withdrawal symptom , still unclear long-term effect . Hence , must test contribution tobacco reduction . This protocol particularly innovative , since aim test efficacy electronic device screen program ( lung cancer prevention program COSMOS II IEO ) , tobacco reduction strictly need order lower individual 's risk . Methods Design . This experimental protocol design main aim investigate role Tobacco Free Cigarettes ( TFC ) , also call e-cigarettes , help smoker improve lung health quit reduce tobacco consume . In particular , investigator aim investigate clinical ( physical symptom , particular focus breathe quality difficulty ) , behavioral ( number tobacco cigarette smoke ) , psychological ( wellbeing , mood quality life ) effect shift TFC . The investigator also analyze , secondary aim , psychological lifestyle component smoker involve order fine correlation data might use compute predictor index able suggest probability success , respect reduction tobacco consuming , use TFC maintain abstinence . The study organize nested randomized control study two arm : one experimental group one control group . The study nest screen program lung cancer , subject recruit . All subject enter psycho-cognitive low-intensity counseling program ( 6 month ) , experimental group TFC ( without nicotine ) use replacement device three month , control group low-intensity counseling provide . Furthermore , low-cost non-invasive electronic device ( FitBit activity tracker ) use order monitor behavioral ( lifestyle ) , sleep quality physical activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Tobacco Free Cigarette</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate cigarette smoking claim live 500 million people alive today many one billion people 21st century . Even though clinical therapy smoking cessation show efficacy , long-time abstinence rate low yet . Tobacco Free Cigarettes ( TFC , also know electronic cigarette ) battery-operated device design vaporize liquid solution propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin nicotine aroma may dissolve . The worth tool reduces risk smoke related disease . If use TFC heavy smoker favor reduction cancer ' risk , role antismoking program complete cleared yet . World Health Organization ( WHO ) US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) promote launch research field . In prospective 6-month study , TFCs show substantially decrease tobacco cigarette consumption without cause significant side effect . The study show decline cig/day use expire carbon monoxide ( CO ) level observe study visit three study group , consistent difference among study group . Furthermore , rapid improvement breathing symptom record . However , tobacco cigarette consumption 1 year report 10 % participant . This probably due fact research target smoker non intend quit . We argue motivated smoker much well result might achieve . From physiological point view TFCs appear contrast crave tobacco , manner nicotine replacement therapy . In overview Cochrane Library study 35.000 patient assessed show NRT utilization antismoking treatment help smoker short-time ( three month ) , long-time ( six month ) . This probably due exclusively focus physiological issue . The protocol provide opportunity test efficacy TFC tool clinically control setting , order reduce tobacco consumption improve clinical . Furthermore , protocol nest lung cancer screen program COSMOS II , allow subject recruitment continuous monitoring . The Cosmos II ( Continuous Observation SMOking Subjects ) aim improve early diagnosis lung cancer consider today important life-saving tool . This Italian study , coordinate IEO create identify optimal personalize protocol early diagnosis people subject high risk lung cancer . The COSMOS II enroll 10,000 heavy smoker former smoker throughout Italy . COSMOS II derive previous successful screening project COSMOS I. Methods/Design Main objective : To evaluate impact three month TFC program reduce smoking-related respiratory symptom ( dry cough , breath shortness , mouth irritation catarrh ) consequence reduce tobacco cigarette consumption among CT screen population . Secondary objective : 1 . To assess success rate smoke cessation attempt three group 2 To monitor safety toxicity study 3 . To evaluate psychological behavioral ( lifestyle ) effect TFC 4 . To assess TFC use impact quality life . More detail , main aim project refers efficacy TFCs tobacco improve lung health heavy smoker involve COSMOS II program . If prove safe efficacy , TFC include lung cancer screen program standard tool reduce smoking-related risk lung disease . Naturally , aim require scientific approach , since TFC increase nicotine dependence . Another fundamental aim project refers efficacy TFCs tobacco consume reduction . In particular , none study already test feasibility efficacy tool limit risk behavior ( tobacco smoke ) among heavy smoker enrol lung cancer screen program . Consequently , want analyze provide TFC participant control protocol reduce tobacco consumption related health problem breathe problem . We also aim analyse psychological characteristic need subject enrol COSMOS II program , order evaluate risk perception ( premise risk behaviour adoption ) associate psycho-cognitive profile . We argue important successful screening project , COSMOS , incorporate comprehensive approach individual . Finally , thanks use continuous data track system concomitant use questionnaire base anamnestic assessment lifestyle behavior habit , possible collect data order find consistency discrepancy two method . TRIAL DURATION AND STUDY DESIGN The project last 24 month design 6-months Nested Randomized Control Study conduct European Institute Oncology . The protocol address physical clinical characteristic , order find effect smoker ' behavior , psychological parameter , test individual feature may hinder behavioral change relate positive effect health . Indeed , heavy smoker characterize specific psycho-cognitive trait . In particular , generally present high level impulsivity non-smokers . At time , smoker tend high level activity behavioral approach system ( BAS ) . It suggest high BAS sensitivity involve addictive behavior , instance smoking . Individuals high level BAS incline enact approach behavior experience positive affect receive positive reward . Furthermore , Dovratek colleague ( 2011 ) demonstrate smoker high rumination attitude show great risk relapse abstinence , especially , smoker characterize high level impulsivity . The experimental design , timeline nicotine dos derive previous research protocol demonstrate suit achieve similar objective . With respect group 1 group 2 , double blind randomization use , order avoid confound effect . Consequently , participant use TFC wo n't know `` vape '' nicotine-containing nicotine-free . Starting framework In order achieve objective describe design protocol follow : 1 . To subject physical , psychological , cognitive behavioral ( lifestyle ) screen base battery fast validated tool , administer . It allow assessment personality trait , awareness 's degree openness change . 2 . Each subject recruit involved behavioral support program ( low-intensity counseling ) , order support subject track data gather fast information need research activity . 3 . The protocol organize three arm : 1 . In first arm subject receive 3-months TFC ( nicotine ) program 3-months monitoring program ; undergo basal final evaluation ; 2 . In second arm subject receive 3-months TFC ( nicotine-free ) program ; undergo basal final evaluation ; monitor 6 month ( data track ) ; 3 . In third arm , baseline/final evaluation , data track behavioral support deliver . Subjects randomly assign group first assessment point . In group , participant follow 6 month program ( 3 month active program plus 3 month monitor ) . All participant monitor time sleep quantity quality sleep lifestyle , either traditional instrument , use electronic bracelet . Participants train use electronic bracelet data collect cloud system allow compute statistical correlation lifestyle , withdrawal symptom , desire smoke , recurrence , . From point view , research project collect data currently available . An e-messaging base helpline activate order offer full assistance participant use bracelet research related activity .</detailed_description>
