	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( FDG ) /positron emission tomography ( PET ) direct treatment improves response patient stomach gastroesophageal junction cancer spread past stomach respond usual treatment . PET scan different way take picture cancer use look much energy ( glucose ) use cancer . Using PET scan early monitor success treatment may allow doctor measure response change treatment accordingly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG-PET Directed Treatment Improving Response Patients With Locally Advanced Stomach Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-registered patient receive standard pre-operative chemotherapy comprise epirubicin intravenously 50mg/m^2 ( IV ) day 1 ; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m^2 IV cisplatin 60 mg/m^2 IV day 1 ; capecitabine 625 mg/m^2 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) fluorouracil 200 mg/m^2/day IV continuously day 1-21 ; undergo FDG-PET follow course 1 ( day 15-19 ) . Patients define FDG-PET non-responders register randomized 1 2 treatment arm . Primary objective To assess compare overall survival ( OS ) patient locally advanced gastric cancer classify FDG-PET non-responders one cycle pre-operative chemotherapy randomly assign receive either salvage chemotherapy surgery immediate surgery follow fluorouracil sensitized radiotherapy . Secondary objective 1 . To assess compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment arm ( Arms A B ) . 2 . To assess compare R0 resection rate treatment arm ( Arms A B ) . 3 . To assess compare pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate treatment arm ( Arms A B ) . 4 . To assess adverse event ( AE ) profile safety treatment arm ( Arms A B ) , include post-operative mortality rate , 30-day post-operative targeted adverse event ( i.e. , dehiscence , significant infection , re-operation rate ) . 5 . To examine change FDG-PET SUV induce pre-operative chemotherapy different time point ( baseline completion one cycle treatment randomization , 2 cycle salvage treatment ) patient randomized salvage treatment arm ( Arm B ) . 6 . To collect measurement fatigue overall perception QOL registration study ( Alliance registration QOL assessment study ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Eligibility Criteria 1 . Documentation Disease 1.1 Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma stomach gastroesophageal junction ( Siewert type II , III ) 1.2 Pretreatment clinical stage T34N M0 T N positive M0 determine laparoscopy , CT scan ( PET/CT ) , endoscopic ultrasound ( histologic confirmation lymph involvement require ) . Therefore , patient measurable nonmeasurable disease . 1.3 Patients T12N0M0 tumor patient metastatic disease NOT eligible . 2 . Patients must eligible curative intent surgical resection . 3 . FDG Avid malignancy Patients must FDG avid tumor ( ) . FDG avid tumor define primary tumor increase uptake region tumor SUV &gt; 5.0 tumor : liver SUV ratio &gt; 1.5 . 4 . No prior history congestive heart failure NYHA class I IV know DPD deficiency 5 . No current grade 2 , 3 , 4 neuropathy . 6 . No known hypersensitivity epirubicin , oxaliplatin cisplatin , capecitabine 5flurouracil , docetaxel irinotecan . 7 . Not pregnant nursing , study involve agent know genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect . 7.1 Therefore , woman childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test pregnancy test do ≤ 7 day prior preregistration require . 7.2 A female childbearing potential sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . 8 . Age ≥ 18 year 9 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 10 . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , except patient Gilbert 's disease AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Registration Eligibility Criteria Treatment Arms A B 1 . Patient must continue eligible curative intent surgical resection . 2 . Disease Progression : FDG avid malignancy classify FDG PET non responder . PET nonresponders define &lt; 35 % reduction FDG uptake primary tumor compare baseline . 3 . Concomitant Medications 3.1 Chronic concomitant treatment strong inhibitor CYP3A4 allow trial . Patients strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must discontinue drug 14 day prior start study treatment . 3.2 Chronic concomitant treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer allow . Patients must discontinue drug 14 day prior start study treatment . 4 . Patient must receive one cycle follow regimen preregistration time period therapy gastric gastroesophageal junction cancer : Epirubicin , Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine Epirubicin , Oxaliplatin , Fluorouracil Epirubicin , Cisplatin , Capecitabine Epirubicin , Cisplatin , Fluorouracil 5 . Toxicity recovery include follow : Grade ≤ 2 neuropathy Grade ≤ 2 diarrhea Grade ≤ 2 mucositis 6 . Preregistration chemotherapy give within 42 day treatment ( treatment meaning surgery Arm A , chemotherapy Arm B )</criteria>
