	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety immunogenicity investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine administer approximately 3 000 adult Africa single IM dose Considering risk exposure Ebola potential ( base animal data ) investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine afford least partial protection , subject study receive investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine . The subject Group EBO-Z receive vaccine Day 0 study , whereas subject Group Placebo/ EBO-Z receive placebo Day 0 ( control ) receive investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine Month 6 , provide safety concern raise . In addition , vaccinate subject study investigational ChAd3 EBO Z vaccine allow increase safety database investigational vaccine . In case geographic range Ebola virus Zaire ( EBOV ) transmission expand encompass region trial conduct , early administration investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine subject Group Placebo/ EBO-Z consider region .</brief_summary>
