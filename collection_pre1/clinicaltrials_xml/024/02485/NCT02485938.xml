	<detailed_description>Approximately 24 , 30 , subject randomize study , two sequential enrollment group . Safety data Group 1 undergo Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review prior initiation enrollment Group 2 . The first 6-8 randomize subject comprise Group 1 , include minimum 3 subject complete intracoronary infusion CAP-1002 . The DSMB conduct review interim safety data 72 hour post-Day 0 least 3 infused subject least 6 subject overall . Enrollment Group 2 begin per DSMB recommendation follow review 72 hour safety data Group 1 . Group 2 include approximately 18 subject . Screening randomization continue total 12 subject infuse CAP 1002 30 subject randomize study , whichever come first . All subject assign active treatment arm receive intend total dose 75 million ( M ) CAP-1002 cell infuse 25M cell three leave ventricle cardiac territory ( anterior , lateral , inferior/posterior ) . Subjects randomize receive usual care continue care treat whatever manner investigator deem appropriate subject ongoing basis , receive infusion . Randomization take place within 30 day first screen procedure . After completion screening procedure , eligible subject randomize active treatment arm receive CAP-1002 administer via intracoronary infusion Day 0 . Day 0 eligible subject randomize usual care arm occur 7 day date randomization . All randomized subject follow-up telephone call Study Day 3 , study visit Weeks 2 6 , Months 3 , 6 12 post Day 0 .</detailed_description>
