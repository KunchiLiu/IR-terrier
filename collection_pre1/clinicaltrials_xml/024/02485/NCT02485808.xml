	<brief_title>Symptoms Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network ( LURN ) Prospective Observational Cohort Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Symptoms Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network ( LURN ) establish National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) advance understand low urinary tract dysfunction ( LUTD ) woman men . LUTD term intend comprehensive challenge current paradigm symptomatic pelvic disorder define 'diseases . ' Lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) likely cause exacerbate variety factor thus represent manifestation single disease . Clinical management LUTD , include treatment outcome , remain suboptimal since biological psychosocial factor initiate , exacerbate , modify group symptom remain largely unknown . As initial effort well characterize biological psychosocial factor initiate , exacerbate , modify LUTS , LURN investigator establish prospective Observational Cohort Study men woman LUTS present first time LURN physician . Information obtain study participant initially ( time enrollment ) include standardized clinical examination , medical history , select test low urinary tract , participant ' self-report LUTS , pelvic floor symptom include sexual function bowel symptom , depression , anxiety , sleep pattern , stress , metabolic risk factor , health-related quality life . We also collect serum , urine , saliva , perineal swabs men vaginal swab woman storage NIDDK Sample Repository future study LURN investigator broader research community . This information use construct subgroup patient similar symptom , clinical presentation , comorbidities , pelvic floor dysfunction , psychological profile . These patient characteristic behavior likely affect evaluation , diagnosis , and/or treatment LUTS . Additional information collect 3 month 12 month enrollment 3 12 month surgery patient receive surgical treatment , include interval clinical history , participant ' self-report LUTS , pelvic floor symptom include sexual function bowel symptom , depression , anxiety , health-related quality life . We also collect biological sample 3 12 month enrollment . The LURN Neuroimaging Sensory Testing component study investigate abnormal sensation lower urinary tract level organism . Subjects controls one-time visit soon baseline visit , undergo fMRI scan brain multimodal quantitative sensory test assess perceptual response physical stimulus ( pain sound ) . The information collect prospective Observational Cohort Study limit sufficient fully understand pathophysiology biology LUTS . Therefore , Observational Cohort Study serve basis LURN study . The long-term goal LURN well characterize patient LUTD order advance future research pathophysiology</detailed_description>
