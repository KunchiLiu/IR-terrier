	<brief_title>Identifying Subgroups With High Cardiovascular Risk Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Breast cancer ( BC ) incidence increase , mortality BC decreasing . Since life expectancy BC patient improve , evaluation treatment-associated cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) BC survivor become increasingly important . An excess risk CVD , mainly due coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , observed radiotherapy ( RT ) administer 1960s-1980s . Anthracycline-containing CT trastuzumab know induce cardiotoxicity , especially congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . However , long-term risk CVD anthracycline-containing CT , trastuzumab , hormonal therapy ( HT ) contemporary RT technique hardly examine . Furthermore , potential interaction treatment modality well address , limited knowledge contribution classic cardiovascular risk factor metabolic syndrome risk severity treatment-associated CVD BC survivor . Objectives : • evaluate prevalence ( sub ) clinical CVD , cardiovascular risk factor metabolic abnormality among BC survivor treat without anthracyclines two group ( ) 5 - 7 year ( b ) 10 - 12 year diagnosis ; • prospectively evaluate change prevalence ( sub ) clinical CVD , cardiovascular risk factor metabolic abnormality two year patient . Secondary objective evaluate predictive role newly develop marker CVD evaluate effect BC treatment modality , psychosocial outcome , endocrine function menopausal status risk develop ( sub ) clinical CVD . Study design : multicenter ( AVL UMCG ) cross-sectional cohort study prospective monitoring cohort . Study population : female BC survivor treat without anthracyclines 5 - 7 10 - 12 year ago AVL UMCG , age 40-50 year time therapy . Main study parameter : difference ( sub ) clinical cardiovascular damage patient treat without anthracyclines , measure leave ventricular function parameter .</detailed_description>
