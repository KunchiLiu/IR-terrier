	<brief_summary>Sulfonylurea know associate risk hypoglycaemia . However , little known real frequency asymptomatic unreported hypoglycemia impact glycemic control quality life among patient use sulfonylurea ( SUs ) . The frequency hypoglycemia probably underestimate since self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) fail identify asymptomatic episode , especially among patient high risk hypoglycemia unawareness ( long diabetes duration , elderly , recurrent hypoglycemia , etc. ) . No previous study report total hypoglycemia measure continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) large group Canadians , therefore underestimate true incidence event . As age hypoglycemia perception reduce consequence increase due frailty , elderly could especially sensitive risk hypoglycemia . Documentation total number hypoglycemia relevant objective really appreciate potential impact SUs Canadian context . The investigator propose multicenter observational prospective study order study incidence hypoglycaemia measure CGMS among patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) newly prescribe SU . The investigator propose perform baseline test ( pre-initiation SU ) , initiation ( first week first dose SU ) 3 month follow-up treatment , include medical history measure , quality life diabetes treatment satisfaction . In patient T2DM goal ( A1c &gt; 7.0 mmol/L ) , newly prescribe SU , objectives hypothesis study estimate incidence rate hypoglycaemia measure continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) total 3 week period follow initiation SU .</brief_summary>
