	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) affect 30 million people United States represent nation 's leading cause disability . Data year 1996-2005 , indicate OA raise overall health care cost $ 185.5 billion annually . Largely consequence disease , number patient undergoing joint replacement surgery quadruple next 17 year . Importantly , several recent study demonstrate OA independent risk factor cardiovascular disease . Presently investigator medication alter natural history OA . Weight control , exercise physical therapy measure intervention short total joint replacement alter course disease . To make matter bad , investigator experience setback use medication aim symptom control . Recognition toxicities non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) narcotic-based analgesic narrow presently available armamentarium pain control OA . Clearly OA major factor demand well solution health care system redesign . OA involve hand represent major part overall burden disease . In radiographic survey quarter total US population change consistent OA involve hand . Among elderly , radiographic hand OA find half individual many quarter suffer pain functional incapacitation . The joint affect typically first carpometacarpal ( CMC-1 ) joint , distal interphalangeal ( DIP ) joint , proximal interphalangeal ( PIP ) joint . Therapeutic option include acetaminophen , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , variety physical measure physical therapy , bracing , heat cold application . To achieve symptomatic benefit limit systemic toxicity , topical therapy develop either act counter irritant , seek reduce substance P ( capsaicin ) , deliver NSAID locally skin . The lead example latter Diclofenac sodium gel show reduce pain intensity improve hand function double blind control trial . However none measure proven sufficiently effective meet patient need . Topical polytherapy employ study see effective pain OA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Analgesic Activity Topical Formulation Patients With Osteoarthritis Hands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A potentially effective approach provide combination analgesic anti-inflammatory agent topical delivery system . In present study compound anti-inflammatory analgesic property combine vehicle promote penetration molecule skin deeper underlie tissue joint capsule articulation hand . The vehicle consist Versapro cream base ( formulation Medisca , Inc. contain Vitamin E Aloe Vera , along ingredient proprietary ) , Tranilast powder , Pentoxifylline USP powder , Cetyl Myristoleate 40 % wax , liquid Pentylene Glycol , liquid Dimethyl Sulfoxide ( DMSO ) USP , liquid Propylene Glycol USP , liquid Ethoxy Diglycol reagent , liquid Ethyl Alcohol 190 proof USP . These inert ingredient , i.e . promote penetration molecule skin . A mixture follow compound incorporated vehicle active test medication : Diclofenac 3 % - NSAID . FDA pregnancy category C first 30 week , category D. Baclofen 2 % - agonist GABAB receptor . FDA pregnancy category C. Orphenadrine 5 % - anticholinergic drug ethanolamine antihistamine class . FDA pregnancy category C. Bupivacaine 2 % - local anesthetic bind voltage-gated sodium channel block sodium influx nerve cell prevent depolarization . FDA pregnancy category C. Due FDA pregnancy category drug use study , pregnancy exclusion criterion . The control medication : The vehicle alone serve control compound .</detailed_description>
