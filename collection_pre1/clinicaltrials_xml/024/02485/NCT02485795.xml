	<brief_title>Observational Study Impact Genetic Testing Healthcare Decisions Care Interventional Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific genetic variation identify result alteration expression function receptor , enzyme , transporter relevant safety efficacy medical treatment . By provide information regard genetic risk effective therapy individual patient , clinician may improve efficacy treatment decrease risk adverse event . The purpose study evaluate currently available genetic test implement various interventional pain management clinic around United States , whether information result benefit patient care . Considering patient genotype correlate pain sensitivity perception , well autonomic nervous system dysfunction due variation sodium potassium channel , genotypic association significantly improve outcome interventional pain management modality include : - Injections ( also call nerve block use medication ) , steroids opioids , include epidural steroid injection , facet joint injection , single nerve root block , sacroiliac joint injection ; - Radiofrequency Rhizotomy ( radiofrequency ablation neuroablation ) , use x-ray guidance needle electrode tip get heat , temporarily turn nerve 's ability send pain message brain ; , - Intrathecal pump implant provide potent medication straight source pain . Patient receive Proove Bioscience 's genetic test complete validate questionnaire measure specific outcomes related treatment clinical visit , include medication efficacy , reduction adverse drug event , healthcare utilization . Physicians document change make treatment regimen , include adjustment medication non-pharmacological treatment , improvement outcome measure . Statistical analysis perform calculate relationship genotypic phenotypic data point collect study . The result study provide measurable understand medical economic value implement genetic test interventional pain management . Furthermore , data point collect used examine novel correlation association single nucleotide polymorphisms longitudinal clinical outcome measure .</detailed_description>
