	<brief_summary>This clinical trial healthy volunteer administer two experimental Ebola vaccine : ChAd3-EBO Z MVA-EBO Z . Two group volunteer vaccinate vaccine one prime/boost regimen . All ChAd3-EBO Z dose 2.5 x 10^10 - 3.7 x 10^10 vp MVA-EBO Z dose 1.0 x 10^8 pfu . All volunteer receive ChAd3-EBO Z prim vaccine MVA-EBO Z boost vaccine 7 day later . The site administration MVA-EBO Z vaccine differs two group : Group 1 receive MVA-EBO Z vaccine arm ChAd3-EBO Z vaccine . Group 2 receive MVA-EBO Z vaccine opposite arm ChAd3-EBO Z vaccine . The study assess safety vaccination , immune response vaccination . Immune responses measure test blood sample . The ChAd3-EBO Z MVA-EBO Z vaccine call viral vectored vaccine . They make virus modify multiply . The virus extra DNA injection , body make Ebola protein ( Ebola develop ) , immune system build response Ebola without infect . Healthy volunteer recruit Dakar , Senegal . The study fund GSK .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CHUD study team hold sensitisation meeting , specific area target specific population , explain study potential volunteer . During meeting investigator explain follow : need vaccine ( include simple picture burden Ebola disease affect community ) ; current status vaccine development ( include fact likely prolong process probably influence course current epidemic ) ; study screening inform consent procedure ; risk vaccination unproven benefit vaccination . It stress experimental vaccine current evidence provide protection , therefore still necessary take preventive measure seek treatment ill reason vaccination . After sensitisation meeting , CT team actively identify . The study explain eligible participant individual basis . Potential volunteer invite CHUD CT site discussion . Potential volunteer inform free withdraw CT time without give reason . Individuals feel trial appropriate invite attend formal screening visit . Detailed information study provide Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) least 24 hour prior consent undertaken . The informed consent process start screen visit . The volunteer give opportunity ask detail trial , time consider whether participate . The investigator ensure volunteer briefed content PIS language understand . The investigator also ensure volunteer fully understand risk . Any volunteer appear less complete understanding enrol . All volunteer sign date inform consent form study specific procedure ( include screen visit ) perform . If volunteer illiterate , s/he sign inform consent form ; latter case literate adult impartial witness present throughout whole consenting process , write subject 's name date signature sign date consent form . Volunteers sign date two copy consent form , one take away keep , one store subject 's medical record . Vaccinations Group 1 commence 7 day vaccination interim safety review first 5 volunteer receive dose UK CT . The first 5 volunteer vaccinate staggered fashion . The first volunteer receive ChAd63-EBO Z vaccine dose Group 1 vaccinate alone wait 24 hour vaccinate subsequent volunteer group . Two Group 1 volunteer vaccinate 24 hour first , least another 24 hour gap pas vaccinate subject receive ChAd63-EBO Z vaccine Groups 1 &amp; 2 . The staggered vaccine administration procedure adopt vaccination MVA-EBO Z vaccine . A total 20 volunteer enrol group . In Group 2 , vaccination commence 5 volunteer Groups 1 receive ChAd63-EBO Z vaccine dose . The staggered vaccine administration procedure Group 1 adopt vaccination MVA-EBO Z vaccine . A total 20 volunteer enrol group . Volunteers visit daily home study field worker nurse record adverse event ( solicit unsolicited six consecutive day vaccination ) . Additional schedule visit CHUD clinic day 7 , 14 , 28 , 35 , 56 , 90 , 180 post-first vaccination interim history collect , physical examination blood test perform time-points indicated schedule attendance . Blood also take exploratory immunology analysis . All volunteer follow 6 month begin day first vaccination .</detailed_description>
