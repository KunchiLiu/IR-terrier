	<brief_summary>The study aim compare efficacy Nasal High Flow Therapy ( NHF ) low-flow oxygen supplementation improve postoperative intermittent desaturations . If , mode therapy would provide cost effective , relatively easy implement , well tolerate treatment Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) oxygen stabilization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Nasal High Flow Versus Oxygen Positive Airway Pressure Non-Compliance Sleep Apnea Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients identify preoperatively previously diagnose obstructive sleep apnea ( intermittent collapse upper airway asleep ) refuse Continuous Positive Airway Pressure use surgery treat routine postoperative supplemental oxygen alone ( 1 liter per minute ) oscillation oxygen saturation night ( measure overnight oximetry ) treat high nasal flow air insufflator ( Fisher &amp; Paykel Airvo 2 device ) amount oxygen supplement ( 1 liter per minute ) .</detailed_description>
