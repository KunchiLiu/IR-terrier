	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To compare radiographic progression-free survival ( rPFS ) chemotherapy ( cabazitaxel plus prednisone , Arm A ) versus AR-targeted therapy ( enzalutamide abiraterone acetate plus prednisone , Arm B ) mCRPC patient treat docetaxel disease progression receive AR-targeted therapy within 12 month AR treatment initiation ( ≤12 month , either docetaxel ) . Secondary Objectives : - To compare efficacy : - Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate time PSA progression ( TTPP ) . - Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - Overall survival ( OS ) . - Tumor response rate duration tumor response . - Pain response time pain progression . - Symptomatic skeletal event ( SSE ) rate time occurrence SSE . - Health status Health-related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) . - To evaluate correlation signature resistance AR-targeted agent clinical outcome via analysis circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) phenotypes well expression localization proteins include AR isoforms CTCs . - To evaluate safety 2 treatment arm .</brief_summary>
