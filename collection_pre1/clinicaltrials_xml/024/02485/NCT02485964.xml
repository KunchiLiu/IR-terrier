	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assess Immunogenicity Candidate PSA Peptides Prostate Cancer Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project collect information regard immunogenicity PSA peptides order develop novel therapeutic vaccine . This vaccine consist prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) peptide Candida skin test reagent . Candida recently show promising new vaccine adjuvant promote T-cell response . It induce interleukin-12 ( promote T-cell response ) secretion Langerhans cell , main antigen present cell skin . In Phase I clinical trial treat woman biopsy-proven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSILs ) , precursor cervical cancer , combination human papillomavirus peptide Candida demonstrate safe , induce immune response human papillomavirus , promote T-helper type 1 ( Th-1 ) response ( promotes cellmediated immunity ) vaccine recipient . For treat prostate cancer , PSA ideal antigen express prostate cancer organ . The characteristic peptide effectively use therapeutic vaccine solubility single solution , immunogenicity term contain large number T-cell epitope ( vaccine use patient express certain Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) tissue type ) , ability mature Langerhans cell turn promote T-cell activity . In protocol investigator focus immunogenicity candidate peptide .</detailed_description>
