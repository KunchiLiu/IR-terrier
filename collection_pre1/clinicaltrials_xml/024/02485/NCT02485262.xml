	<brief_summary>Chronic Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection lead cause advance liver disease worldwide . The virus successfully evade host immune detection highly restricted requirement growth vitro many year hamper effort find safe , uncomplicated , reliable oral antiviral therapy . Ten year discovery , pegylated interferon-alpha ribavirin ( PR ) treatment 24-48 week become standard care ( 1-5 ) . PR therapy offer limited performance availability across diverse spectrum HCV disease fraught excessive often limiting side effect . The first direct act agent ( DAAs ) protease inhibitor ( PIs ) introduce 2011 could use combination PR concern rapid PI viral resistance . Although first generation PIs add increase efficacy PR regimen , also add new side effect untoward drug interaction ( 6-8 ) . Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) potent nucleoside inhibitor ( NI ) recently approve treatment HCV . The drug low toxicity , high resistance barrier , minimal drug interaction HCV DAAs PIs anti-NS5A agent . SOF safe effective across different viral genotype , disease stage , special patient group co-infected HIV . When used combination ribavirin another DAA , SOF revolutionize HCV treatment spectrum set stage nearly universal HCV antiviral therapy . Sustained virologic response ( SVR12 ) SOF plus ribavirin pegylated interferon ( PR ) 90 % genotype 1 85-94 % genotypes 2 3 ( 9-16 ) . SOF plus simeprevir ( protease inhibitor ) show 94 % SVR12 genotype 1 ( 9-16 ) . More anti-HCV drug develop date , SOF offer wide applicability infect patient yet give personalize regimen maximize performance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SOF plus simeprevir PR become backbone HCV treatment . The demographic characteristic HCV patient Inland Empire different cohort enrol SOF trial . There need determine community base outcomes match outcome report clinical trial . Aim study To propectively evaluate efficacy tolerability SOF treatment regimen prescribe ARMC compare outcomes report clinical trial basis FDA approval . Study Description This prospective registry study conduct ARMC . Targeted subject HCV patient ARMC receive one SOF base treatment regimens December 20 , 2013 December 19 , 2014 . Primary end Point sustain virological response 12 week ( SVR 12 ) secondary end point compliance safety . Safety compliance determine base symptom report clinic visit number refill dos dispense every patient .</detailed_description>
