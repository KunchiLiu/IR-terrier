	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose selinexor give stem cell transplant treat patient acute myeloid leukemia intermediate high risk spread come back ( intermediate- high-risk ) , myelodysplastic syndrome high risk spread come back ( high-risk ) . Selinexor work stop cancer growth block enzyme , may cause cancer cell die also kill cell cause cancer grow , commonly respond regular chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor Treating Patients With Intermediate- High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome After Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) selinexor patient hematologic malignancy , especially acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) /myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , allogeneic ( allo ) -stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity selinexor maintenance treatment allo-SCT . II . To determine incidence non-relapse mortality . III . To determine 2 year post SCT progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival rate . IV . To determine incidence acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . V. To assess lymphoid myeloid chimerism post transplantation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze donor immune re-constitution allo-SCT selinexor maintenance . II . To monitor minimal residual disease ( MRD ) Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) selinexor treatment AML/MDS patient . III . To characterize physiopathology leukemia initiate cell ( LIC ) time disease relapse selinexor maintenance compare initial diagnosis disease . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Beginning day 60-100 allo-SCT without evidence GVHD grade 1 disease relapse stable hematopoietic recovery , patient receive selinexor orally ( PO ) day 1 week day 1 3 week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
