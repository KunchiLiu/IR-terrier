	<brief_summary>Background : Prostate cancer difficult detect use ultrasound . As result , case suspicion prostate cancer base digital rectal examination ( DRE ) Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level , currently recommend perform `` blind '' systematically distributed biopsy 10-18 sample obtain predefined location gland . These so-called systematic biopsy ( SB ) may lead improper patient management ( ) miss clinically significant cancer , especially anterior half gland tend undersampled , ( ii ) induce chance detection clinically insignificant cancer focus may result overtreatments , ( iii ) undersampling tumor focus thus underestimating volume aggressiveness . Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( mp-MRI ) yield promising result detect aggressive ( Gleason ≥7 ) prostate cancer . Several monocenter study show targeted biopsy ( TB ) base mp-MRI finding could detect significantly aggressive cancer , reduce diagnosis clinically insignificant cancer , good evaluate aggressiveness detect cancer SB . However , monocenter study provide low-level evidence three recent independent review literature conclude need robust multicenter trial evaluate diagnostic yield TB compare SB . This particularly important since many academic private center France already perform mp-MRI prostate biopsy daily routine . Therefore risk approach become norm without properly evaluate crucial urgent perform control multicentric study provide high-level evidence whether mp-MRI obtain prostate biopsy . One control multicentric study publish recently SB TB obtain two different operator 95 patient . TB yield significantly high detection rate prostate cancer ( 69 % vs 59 % , p=0.033 ) clinically significant cancer ( 67 % vs 52 % , p=0.0011 ) . However , study limit fact patient negative mp-MRI include . Research hypotheses : There currently robust multicenter trial compare prostate TB base mp-MRI finding versus current standard care ( SB ) . We propose multicentre prospective trial compare result SB TB perform patient two independent operator . Our hypothesis TB detect aggressive ( Gleason ≥7 ) cancer significantly high percentage patient SB . Main objective : Compare percentage patient `` clinically significant cancer '' ( use definition A , i.e . cancer Gleason score ≥7 ) detect SB versus TB .</brief_summary>
