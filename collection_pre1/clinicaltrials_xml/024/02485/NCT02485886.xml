	<brief_summary>Inflammation mediate macrophage infiltration play vital role diverse range physiological condition . In particular , recent evidence suggest type macrophage response important disease pathology pulmonary fibrosis . Because cysteine cathepsins proteases highly express antigen present cell macrophage , serve promise biomarkers . Employing non-invasive imaging agent 68Ga-BMV101 specifically recognize cysteine protease immune cell potential aid early detection also significantly aid effort monitor progression patient response therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-BMV101 PET/CT Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For interest clinical translation 68Ga-BMV101 , open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study design investigate safety diagnostic performance 68Ga-BMV101 patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . A single dose nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BMV101 intravenously inject healthy volunteer patient suspect IPF . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image . Changes blood pressure , pulse , respiration , temperature , routine blood urine test , serum alanine aminotransferase , albumin , creatinine , adverse event collect volunteer . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Males female , ≥18 year old Characteristic clinical sign , symptom laboratory test suggest diagnosis IPF . The diagnosis IPF base The Centres Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) criteria diagnose IPF . They rely combination clinical , radiological , operative histological finding , addition result laboratory test . Females plan bear child recently childbearing potential Renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ( 270 μM/L ) Liver function : hepatic enzyme level 5 time upper limit normal . Known severe allergy hypersensitivity IV radiographic contrast . Patients able enter bore PET/CT scanner . Inability lie still entire imaging time cough , pain , etc . Inability complete need examination due severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease , opinion investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
