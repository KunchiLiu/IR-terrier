	<detailed_description>In study , part EC FP7 project Aggressotype ( FP7-Health-2013-Innovation-1 602805 , Aggression subtyping improved insight treatment innovation psychiatric disorder ) , investigator focus test innovative , non-pharmacological therapeutic approach child adolescent different subtypes aggressive behavior problem . Participants trained acquire control arousal measure skin conductance/electrodermal activity . As aggressive behavior involve dysregulation arousal rest response emotional stimulus ( low electrodermal activity heart rate , difference EEG ) , individualized acquisition self-control one arousal level might represent promise therapeutic approach kind disorder . While try control arousal level , participant receive direct continuous feedback physiological state change , reward successful manipulation , i.e . up- downregulation . During transfer trial continuous feedback omit . Biofeedback method currently use treat patient variety psychiatric disorder ADHD . The investigator would like focus follow question concern effectiveness treatment approach : 1 . Can participant gain increase control arousal level biofeedback train electrodermal activity ? 2 . Which short- long term consequence expect improved self-control physiological measure arousal upon aggressive antisocial behavior problem ? Before training , subject undergo extensive pre-treatment assessment part characterization subtyping aggression within large multicenter subtyping study ( EU-Aggressotype EU-MATRICS ) . The assessment include clinical psychometric measure , neuropsychological testing , fMRI ( 3 task + rest state ) , MRS ( 2 voxels ) DTI well biosampling ( blood/saliva genetics/epigenetics/hormones ) . Comparison typically develop ( TD ) control group receive intervention allow interpret change term normalisation compensation . After completion pretest , subject meet inclusion criterion arousal-biofeedback treatment study randomly assign two different treatment arm , either experimental arousal feedback condition comparator condition TAU last 20 week . Subjects assign experimental condition receive 20 session ( 1/week ) arousal ( electrodermal activity ) -feedback , learn either in- decrease level electrodermal activity . At begin first treatment session , baseline assessment arousal measure do order determine arousal subtype participant ( hypo- hyperarousal ) , main direction individualize training ( up- downregulation ) . Afterwards , train last 1 hour consist several experimental block , include feedback well transfer trial EEG heart rate record simultaneously session . Video clip emotional aggressive situation use support regulation arousal . During first 10 session , participant ask increase/decrease electrodermal activity proportion 2:1 depend dominant arousal subtype , order train mainly upregulation patient hypoarousal , downregulation patient hyperarousal . Subjects comparator TAU arm receive several session psychoeducation counsel parents/caregivers group train 20 week . After first 10 session feedback training ( several appointment parents/caregivers group training TAU group ) approximately 10 week begin training , parents/caregivers ask shortly evaluate behavioral measure aggressive behavior fill MOAS . In feedback group arousal measure reassess do begin first training ass stability . After completion either train TAU , subject undergo post-treatment assessment include teacher parent report behavioral measure , well neuropsychological testing , fMRI MRS. A follow-up assessment parent teacher report behavioral measure take place 6 month end treatment phase .</detailed_description>
