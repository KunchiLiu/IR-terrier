	<brief_summary>A single-blinded randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) design compare Single-Site robot-assisted single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The study directly compare surgical approach cohort 60 patient ( 30 patient arm ) benign gallbladder disease Department Surgery Cantonal Hospital Winterthur ( Kantonsspital Winterthur ) Switzerland . The primary endpoint study surgeon 's physical mental stress load time surgery assess validated Local Experienced Discomfort ( LED ) Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire ( SMEQ ) visual analogue scale . The secondary endpoint include cost procedure , intra-operative blood loss , operate time , intra-operative conversion rate additional trocar placement , complication , length hospital stay , Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) cosmesis . HRQoL cosmesis assess use validated Gastrointestinal Quality Life Index ( GIQLI ) Body Image Questionnaires ( BIQ ) , respectively . The inclusion criterion cover notably symptomatic cholecystolithiasis , chronic cholecystitis , benign gallbladder polyp age ≥18 year . The exclusion criterion , among others , acute cholecystitis , emergency cholecystectomy , previous extensive upper abdominal surgery suspicion malignant disease . Non-stratified block randomization ( random block size 2 4 ) use achieve balance allocation participant treatment arm prevent premature decode randomization scheme . Hereby , patient inform group assignment last outpatient follow-up he/she complete return required questionnaire ( GIQLI BIQ ) . The operation perform accord group assignment senior surgeon wide experience robotic Single-Site conventional single-incision laparoscopy . All data record safely use SecuTrialTM program . Sample-size calculation base result previously mention experimental setup Schatte et al , utilize estimate effect size 0.8 , power 0.8 alpha-error level 0.05 , well consider potential additional error margin 10-15 % calculation ( G-Power 3.1 software , Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf/Germany ) . The estimated total duration study 1.5 year , include schedule 1-month 1-year postoperative follow-up visit . The study carry accordance principle enunciate current version Declaration Helsinki , guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) issue International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) , Swiss regulatory authority 's requirement .</brief_summary>
