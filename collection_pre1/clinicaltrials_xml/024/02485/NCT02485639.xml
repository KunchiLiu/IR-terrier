	<brief_summary>The primary objective investigate longevity humoral immunity influenza virus human . Our overarch hypothesis understand long-term humoral immunity influenza virus generate maintain essential development `` universal '' vaccine influenza virus . The secondary objective longitudinal track vaccine-induced B cell responses special emphasis broadly neutralize HA stem reactive response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase IV open label single arm study enrol 55 healthy male non-pregnant female single site , 18-49 year old , inclusive . The primary objective study design assess humoral response influenza vaccination longevity humoral immunity influenza vaccination healthy adult . Secondary objective include longitudinal track vaccine-induced B cell responses special emphasis broadly neutralizing HA stem-reactive response . The laboratory technique characterize persistence clonotype antigen specific B-cells plasmablast blood bone marrow . Enrolled subject receive license seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine ( administer part study ) . The vaccine administer accord package insert , study participant donate serial sample blood bone marrow aspirate immunology monitoring . Safety assess time study enrollment last study visit , via monitor vital sign , change health status , target physical exam safety lab prior bone marrow aspirate procedure . Repeated measurement humoral immunity obtain 7 day , 14 day , 28 day , 90 day one year post vaccination ass magnitude , clonal diversity persistence B-cell responses influenza vaccination . The study duration 4 year subject offer opportunity participate study 3 consecutive year provide eligibility criterion meet year . Subjects elect continue study first year participation rescreened verify continued eligibility re-consented prior subsequent participation . Re-enrolling subject receive new subject identifier count towards total enrollment number subsequent year participation . A separate subject record maintain year subject re-enrolls study . Enrollment next year begin availability seasonal flu vaccine . For subject elect re-enroll study , Day 365 visit ( +/- 3 month window ) would also Day 0 visit subsequent year .</detailed_description>

Female subject child bear potential must negative urine pregnancy test screen visit , enrollment visit prior subsequent bone marrow aspirate procedure . Female subject childbearing potential must agree practice abstinence , use barrier method birth control , use FDA approve form birth control . 11 . Subjects receive seasonal flu vaccine current year ( September June ) 1 . If female , active pregnancy breastfeed plan become pregnant study participation . 2 . Subject report medical disease condition , opinion site principal investigator appropriate subinvestigator , contraindication study participation . This include acute chronic medical disease condition , define persist 3 month ( define 90 day ) long , would place subject unacceptable risk injury , render subject unable meet requirement protocol , may interfere evaluation response subject 's successful completion study . 3 . Subject report take anticoagulant , longterm ( great 14 day ) systemic steroid immunosuppressive medication 4 . Subject report know allergy lidocaine . 5 . Subject report know hypersensitivity allergy egg , egg chicken protein , report allergy component study vaccine component study vaccine 6 . Subject report know latex allergy 7 . Subject report history severe reaction follow previous immunization license unlicensed influenza virus vaccine 8 . Subject report history GuillainBarre syndrome 9 . Subjects believe tolerate bone marrow aspiration without sedation . 10 . Subjects active infection acute illness within 72 hour prior study vaccination . Subject acute illness nearly resolve minor residual symptom remain allowable , opinion site principal investigator appropriate subinvestigator , residual symptom interfere ability ass safety parameter require protocol . 11 . Subjects participate another clinical trial involve use investigational agent vaccine .</criteria>
