	<brief_summary>The investigator PGIMER practice hypofractionation radiotherapy dose 35Gy/15 # /3wks chest wall post mastectomy 40Gy/16 # /3wks breast conservation breast cancer patient last 4 decade . It also routine practice UK center Canada . Hypofractionation reduce treatment time half maintain cosmesis give control rate equal conventional fractionation . As breast cancer lead cancer female radiation therapy important part local management , hypofractionation help radiation center worldwide meet grow need radiation breast cancer , particularly develop country resource limit . It also reduce financial burden patient family . In study investigator want reduce treatment duration 3 week 2 week . The study include 20 patient breast cancer post mastectomy breast conservative surgery treat radiotherapy dose 34Gy 10 fraction 2 week . Patients assess acute radiation toxicity weekly treatment one month completion treatment .</brief_summary>

Twenty patient histologically prove post lumpectomy/mastectomy case carcinoma breast suitable radiotherapy enrol study . Patients would evaluate Department Radiotherapy PGIMER , Chandigarh thorough clinical examination follow routine investigation include hemogram , liver function test , kidney function test , chest X-ray . Patients treated standard rectangular tangential fields.The study include 20 patient breast cancer post mastectomy breast conservative surgery treat radiotherapy dose 34Gy 10 fraction 2 week follow boost 10Gy/5 # /1wk case intact breast . Acute toxicity assess use RTOG grade system . This carried weekly radiotherapy 4 week treatment . If symptoms persist patient assess weekly reaction settle RTOG grade 1 less ( Annexure I ) . Statistical analyse The principle end point study analysis acute toxicity , cosmetic score analysis . Skin , subcutaneous toxicity cosmetic assessment do treatment regular follow study . Chi-square test use compare radiation toxicity parameter . Descriptive statistic include mean standard deviation obtain variable . p value &lt; 0.05 take significant .
