	<brief_summary>Rationale : Hallucinations occur many patient different kind disease , include psychiatric , neurological perceptual impairment . The origin hallucination partly understood . This prevents correct prediction treatment response hamper development new , effective treatment strategy . Different subtypes hallucination result different neuropathology may exist across diagnostic entity , responsive different treatment strategy . Understanding origin subtypes use fMRI EEG help make rational treatment decision individual basis enhance development innovative treatment paradigm . Objective : The primary objective find specific abnormality rest state fMRI related pathophysiology different subtypes hallucination . Secondary objective find EEG connectivity measure related pathophysiology different subtypes hallucination , reveal correlate pattern EEG fMRI underlie experience hallucination across different disorder , examine frequency spontaneous synchronize burst activation auditory visual cortex use fMRI . Study design : The investigator intend examine neural correlate hallucination different disorder use rest state EEG , fMRI sMRI observational study . Study population : A total 140 hallucinating patient include , 20 7 different diagnostic group . As control group , 140 non-hallucinating patient disorder similar severity include . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study endpoint difference rest state correlate measure fMRI hallucinate non-hallucinating participant hallucinate individual different subtypes , namely : connectivity within DMN connectivity DMN sensory cortex hippocampal-amygdala complex . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Participation study entail MRI scan 40 minute EEG measurement 5 minute . Total visit time , include preparation , approximately 2,5 hour . The risk associate participation benefit individual negligible . The potential benefit society future considerable finding lead optimization treatment strategy treatment response .</brief_summary>
