	<detailed_description>Introduction Atrophic vaginitis condition affect majority postmenopausal woman . It characterize dryness inflammation vagina , thin vaginal tissue . Atrophic vaginitis cause decreased effect estrogens post menopause . This condition become significant time , systemic level estrogen decline . This contrast vasomotor symptoms peri-menopause early post-menopause , generally subside time pass . Therefore , age demographic , condition ever-growing population require treatment . However , minority woman suffer atrophic vaginitis seek medical help . Instead , many woman make difficult lifestyle change deal symptom . This may include avoid sexual activity avoid associate pain intercourse . The vagina significant estrogen receptor . Effects estrogens vagina well study . Currently , numerous estrogenic therapy option , systemic local , treat symptom vaginal atrophy . Recent evidence support efficacy population lower vaginal estrogen dos ( 10mcg ) previously use ( 25mcg ) . Emerging evidence demonstrate efficacy ultra-low dos estrogen therapy . The search low dos estrogen therapy suggest ongoing distrust among public scientific community acceptability estrogen therapy . Despite low , many woman still unable unwilling use local estrogen therapy . The option woman limit . Studies show progesterone receptor vaginal tissue . The use progesterone treat atrophic vaginitis yet study . However , use studied population . Progesterone therapy long use support fertility reproductive age woman , side effect . Progesterone also long history use menopausal population . It administer combined therapy estrogen , provide endometrial protection hyperplasia malignancy . This addition progestin systemic estrogen therapy woman uterus standard care . There significant group woman use , choose use , respond estrogenic therapy . The goal study evaluate efficacy vaginal progesterone treatment urogenital atrophy , compare placebo . The ultimate goal expand treatment option patient symptoms vaginal atrophy . Hypothesis The current standard care woman vaginal atrophy treatment local estrogen . However , significant number woman prefer use estrogen therapy potential side effect . The alternative option provide limited symptomatic relief . The investigator propose vaginal progesterone alternative therapeutic option relief vaginal atrophy . The objective study find effective alternative therapeutic option vaginal estrogen , way vaginal progesterone , treatment vaginal atrophy . Hypotheses include : 1 . Local progesterone superior placebo patient report symptom . 2 . Women receive course local progesterone superior physician assessment vaginal atrophy compare placebo . 3 . Local progesterone improve vaginal pH maturation index compare placebo . Methods Population : The study conduct Dr. Wolfman 's Gynecology Menopause Clinics Mount Sinai Hospital Ontario Power Generation Building . Women post menopausal present complaint vaginal atrophy eligible inclusion study . Women may self identify participate study , response recruitment material present clinical office , may identify health care professional . Study Design This randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . The participant randomize 1:1 ratio either vaginal progesterone suppository , identical placebo . The dose vaginal progesterone suppository 100mg . The study medication provide Australia Research Centre Health Women Babies , University Adelaide . Randomization complete computer generate system Mount Sinai Pharmacy . Study medication ship directly home study participant . Participation study consist two clinical visit . The first clinical visit baseline visit . The second visit occur follow twelve week use study medication . The visit similar procedure time involve , follow : Baseline : - Symptom questionnaire - Clinical breast exam - Vaginal speculum exam , include Pap test - Serum progesterone level - Cholesterol panel , complete within previous year - Approximately 60 minute length Follow-Up : - Symptom questionnaire - Clinical breast exam - Vaginal speculum exam , include vaginal exam - Serum progesterone level - Approximately 60 minute length The symptom questionnaire ask patient rate symptom vaginal atrophy . It evaluate following : - vaginal dryness - vaginal and/or vulvar irritation itch - vaginal pain associate sexual activity Symptoms rat scale 0 3 , zero none , one mild , two moderate three severe . Patients ask identify bothersome symptom . Patients sexually active may participate . The vaginal exam perform study gynecologist , Dr. Wolfman Menopause fellow . Patients also vaginal speculum exam perform staff gynecologist fellow . Vaginal swab collect assess vagina pH maturation index . pH measure insert pH test strip upper third vagina complete read strip damp . A sample slide vaginal cell collect send laboratory order measure maturation value . Clinical breast exam conduct rule clinically evident breast disease prior study , follow 12 week study participation . Blood work collect assess serum progesterone level . The investigator anticipate systemic absorption low . A serum cholesterol panel also collect ensure patient normal baseline value recent ( within one year ) result available . Adverse event also record outcome . These include headache , vaginal discharge , vulvo-vaginal mycotic infection ( either diagnose self-treated ) , increase vulvo-vaginal pruritis , vaginal bleeding . On Consent Form , contact information patient able reach study personnel , question concern , need report adverse event . A 24 hour emergency number also available patient study , need contact study personnel time . Adverse event deal case-by-case basis , occur . A record make adverse event , study investigator . For serious adverse event , patient advise immediately study study medication . Unblinding staff and/or study participant occur deem necessary . All relevant clinical outcome evaluate therapy initiation , baseline visit , follow 12 week therapy . Improvement symptoms two time period evaluate .</detailed_description>
