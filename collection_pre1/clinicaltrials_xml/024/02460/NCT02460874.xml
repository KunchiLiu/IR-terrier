	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : Pilot Portion : To determine feasibility safety administer oral glyburide non-diabetic patient receive stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) newly diagnose brain metastasis . Randomized Portion : To determine number patient newly diagnose brain metastasis increase edema measure volumetric FLAIR image number patient require dexamethasone administration ( corticosteroid administration purpose treat cerebral edema ) day SRS one month follow-up MRI group receive glyburide versus placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glyburide v Placebo Prophylaxis Against Cerebral Edema Patients Receiving Radiosurgery Brain Metastases ( RAD 1502/UAB 1593 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient cancer spread brain side effect cause swell around tumor . A common treatment swell medicine call dexamethasone . Dexamethasone steroid . Long-term use steroid several known side effect . Recent study show drug commonly use control high blood sugar diabetes , call glyburide , decrease brain swell patient brain damage stroke . Animal study show drug may also reduce swell tumor brain . Researchers interested whether glyburide could treat brain swell well dexamethasone few side effect . This study do see whether glyburide safe use patient without diabetes combination receive SRS brain metastasis . This study also find glyburide decrease brain swell patient get radiosurgery ( SRS ) brain metastasis . This study also find take glyburide decrease chance need steroid due brain swell causing symptom . It yet know , investigator ' hope glyburide decrease brain swell lessen chance need steroid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 110 newly diagnose brain metastasis . Subject must cytologically histologically confirm malignancy ( original malignancy , brain metastasis ) .The large measurable brain metastasis must least 1.0cm short axis dimension . A diagnostic contrastenhanced MRI brain must perform within 60 day prior registration . The contrastenhancing intraparenchymal brain tumor must well circumscribe must maximum diameter ≤ 4.0 cm direction enhance scan . If multiple lesion present one lesion maximum diameter , ( ) must exceed 3.0 cm maximum diameter . History physical neurological examination , height , weight within 14 day prior registration No dexamethasone use ( corticosteroid use purpose treat cerebral edema ) start 3 day prior treatment planning MRI . Patients may taper meet criterion deem safe treat physician . Women childbearing potential ( e.g . postmenopausal permanently sterilize woman ) must negative pregnancy test obtain within 14 day prior registration . This prevent potential harm fetus glyburide radiotherapy . CBC differential CMP include Liver Function Tests ( LFTs ) obtain within 14 day prior registration meet follow requirement : Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Glucose ≥ 80 mg/dL . Hemoglobin ≥ 7 mg/dL . Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt; 100 cells/mm3 . For Randomized Portion : Subject must least 2 follow risk factor : { For Pilot Portion , require patient risk factor mention Inclusion Criteria 9 . } Pretreatment Edema/Tumor ratio ( ≥ 35:1 ) contour baseline MRI obtain 60 day prior registration . Patients allow Whole Brain Radiotherapy ( WBRT ) corticosteroid use time pretreatment MRI SRS ( long corticosteroid safely taper least 3 day prior treatment plan MRI WBRT least 4 day prior registration ) . Greater 40 pack year history smoking cigarette . Whole Brain Radiotherapy least 4 day 1 year prior registration . RPA Class III . Known sulfonylurea treatment within 7 day prior registration . Sulfonylureas include glyburide/glibenclamide ( Diabeta , Glynase ) ; glyburide plus metformin ( Glucovance ) ; glimepiride ( Amaryl ) ; repaglinide ( Prandin ) ; nateglinide ( Starlix ) ; glipizide ( Glucotrol , GlibeneseR , MinodiabR ) ; gliclazide ( DiamicronR ) ; tolbutamide ( Orinase , Tolinase ) ; glibornuride ( Glutril ) . Leptomeningeal metastasis . Known allergy sulfa specific allergy sulfonylurea drug . Use VEGF inhibitor within 10 day prior registration . Patients receive investigational drug within 10 day prior registration Allergy gadolinium . Type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus actively receive treatment . Cognitive impairment precludes patient act agent provide inform consent . Concurrent use Bosentan . Any major medical illness psychiatric impairment treat physician 's opinion prevent administration completion protocol therapy ( may include patient elderly , debilitate , malnourish person and/or renal , hepatic adrenal insufficiency ) . Pregnant breast feed woman due potential damage fetus Patients treat therapeutic clinical protocol within 10 day prior registration participation study . Inability undergo MRI SRS ( e.g . due safety reason presence pacemaker ) . Deemed treat physician unable eat regular meal . Melanoma renal histology</criteria>
