	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct randomize clinical trial compare incidence dysphagia patient receive general anesthesia without endotracheal tube Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . If incidence dysphagia find increase follow endotracheal intubation procedure could influence investigator practice anesthesiologist may mandate future routine use laryngeal tracheal application lidocaine time intubation example .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial- Dysphagia From ETT GI Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients age 5-17 normal cognitive function present Upper GI endoscopy consider participation study . After consent obtain parent/legal guardian , patient undergo general anesthetic facilitate procedure . All patient study receive general anesthetic . Following routine inhalation induction 8 % sevoflurane oxygen nitrous oxide , 100 % oxygen administer intravenous access secure . Intravenous administration Propofol 3mg/kg Fentanyl 1mcg/kg administer facilitate endotracheal intubation age appropriate endotracheal tube child randomize receive endotracheal intubation . Following endotracheal intubation , oropharynx auscultate presence audible air leak around endotracheal tube . If audible leak appreciate 20cm H2O pressure , cuff endotracheal tube gradually inflate air audible leak longer appreciate . This routine practice follow endotracheal intubation . The endotracheal tube lubricate prior intubation . Those receive endotracheal intubation undergo inhalation induction , intravenous access secure intravenous propofol 3mg/kg Fentanyl 1mcg/kg administer prior placement nasal trumpet connection anesthesia circuit . Both arm patient receive general anesthetic consist sevoflurane oxygen air routine concentration maintenance anesthesia either via endotracheal tube via nasal trumpet Upper GI endoscopy procedure . Other medication administer procedure arm patient include Dexamethasone administer dose 0.15mg/kg 20 mg Ondansetron 0.15mg/kg 4mg post operative nausea vomit prophylaxis . Additional maneuver may aggravate post operative dysphagia use Yankauer suction catheter , placement nasopharyngeal temperature probe cough emergence prior extubation patient avoid . Utilization soft tip suction catheter skin axilla temperature probe employ trachea extubated deep anesthesia . Data collect include : Pre-operative data : recent need breathe treatment , allergy history smoker home . Intraoperative data : presence bucking/coughing intubation , experience level intubating practitioner , laryngoscopic view , endotracheal tube size , number intubation attempt , experience endoscopist , size endoscope use duration procedure . With technique ( intubation nasal trumpet use ) , data collect include : Coughing buck prior extubation emergence removal nasal trumpet , occurence laryngospasm , bronchospasm desaturation le 95 % require treatment , breath-holding method resolution . PACU data : Incidence laryngospasm , breath-holding , apnea , presence absence nausea/vomiting treatment require , requirement additional pain medication , documentation dysphagia prior first oral intake grade sore throat previously document . Postoperatively , presence dysphagia seek two different time point : Via face face interview post operative anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) prior first per oral intake 24 hour later point presence/absence dysphagia ascertain via phone . Complaints grade accord score system ( Capon LM et al . Anesthesiology 1983 ) : Presence sore throat ( ST ) : Yes/No If No , ST grade 0= sore throat If Yes , ST grade 1-3 follow : 1=mild sore throat ( pain swallow ) 2=moderate sore throat ( pain present constantly worsen swallow ) 3=severe sore throat ( pain interferes eat require analgesic medication relief ) . Pain also assess VAS score immediately postoperatively 24 hour</detailed_description>
