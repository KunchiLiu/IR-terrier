	<brief_summary>This study assess telerehabilitation people chronic stroke use combination noninvasive brain stimulation finger track training . Telerehabilitation allow patient train home also allow longer train period currently allow clinically . Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) use two surface electrode connect small battery attach head . This used modulate neuronal excitability . With sensor attach finger wrist , patient move joint track target display screen . The combined treatment apply two experiment . The first 3 patient come lab second 3 patient home , supervision . We integrate two component test result novel treatment system technical feasibility safety , set stage future efficacy study federal grant support . We hypothesize developed system safe feasible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study ass safety feasibility telerehabilitation protocol involve non-invasive brain stimulation . Therefore , two arm study 1 ) implementation protocol control laboratory set 2 ) implementation protocol patient 's home , set patient control remotely use blue-tooth system investigator different location . The two arm study occur successively first arm complete three patient follow second arm complete second group three patient .</detailed_description>
