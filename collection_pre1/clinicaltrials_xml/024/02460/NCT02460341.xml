	<detailed_description>Objectives : The overall objective study examine effect single dos 8 mg , 16 mg , 24 mg ondansetron compare placebo neural mechanism cognition perception healthy individual . Background : Many psychiatric disorder associate altered sensory experience arise within body . Examples include increased experience sensation urge muscle , skin , joint visceral organ tic disorder , OCD patient symptoms `` right experience '' disgust sensitivity , impulse control disorder ( ICDs ) trichotillomania skin-picking . In OCD , sensory phenomenon occur approximately half patient , associate earlier age onset , may harder treat classic cognitive-behavioral approach OCD . Of interest , sensory phenomenon OCD associate Tourette 's syndrome respond pharmacological treatment primarily use tic . As , abnormal sensory processing may basic mechanism link various psychiatric disorder . The process attend body sensation refer interoception , broadly include detection , attention , experience arise viscera soma . Research reveal cortical interoceptive circuit involve insula , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , somatomotor cortex . Ondansetron ( OND ) good candidate modulation above-described interoceptive circuit . It selective 5-HT3 ( serotonin ) receptor antagonist act peripheral central receptor . OND long use treat nausea vomit due chemotherapy , radiation therapy , anesthesia , opioid-induced emesis . It also use alone adjunctive therapy treatment OCD Tourette 's disorder , show efficacy small clinical trial . The mechanisms ondansetron improve symptom OCD tic disorder unknown , recent study find OND application directly insula decrease disgust reaction rat . This data suggest ondansetron 's clinical efficacy could relate effect interoceptive circuit activity insula sensorimotor region , possibility explore current protocol . Typical dosage anti-emetic action 8-24 mg . The investigator 's pilot data find single 16 mg dose ondansetron reduce activation insula somatosensory cortex healthy control patient OCD . As follow-up pilot work , current protocol compare effect three different dosage ondansetron ( 8 mg , 16 mg , 24 mg ) activation insula somatosensory cortex task cognition perception healthy adult .</detailed_description>
