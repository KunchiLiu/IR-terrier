	<detailed_description>The propose randomized trial aim investigate neural mechanism brain connectivity compare response TCC health wellness education class use fMRI biomarkers emotional regulation cognition . Control group include health wellness education program ( HEW ) help control non-specific social support factor . Primary outcome include measure depressive symptom severity . Secondary outcome include cognition , resilience , health functioning , quality life . Maintenance response relapse major depression determine 6 month follow-up . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) correlate emotional processing connectivity relate functional network . Neural correlate work memory , brain structure examine Â½ sample . The researcher investigate whether variation emotional regulation moderate predict emotional functional improvement link TCC . The investigator recruit 220 old adult depressive symptom stable antidepressant treatment least 4 month , randomly assign 12 week : 1.Ta-Chi-Chih ( TCC ) class ; 2 . Health/Wellness Education Program ( HEW ) ; 120 minute per week . All subject receive comprehensive evaluation mood , mental physical health , cognition baseline , 12 week , 6 month . Changes time measure depressive symptom , resilience , quality life , cognition assess random regression model . The investigator anticipate great clinical improvement mood cognition TCC group compare HEW . The investigator also expect clinical improvement correlate change activation right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( VLPFC ) amygdala affect labeling task , work memory-related activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , change functional connectivity brain network activity . This first randomized trial response TCC integrate use fMRI biomarkers response guide development treatment preventive approach geriatric depression .</detailed_description>
