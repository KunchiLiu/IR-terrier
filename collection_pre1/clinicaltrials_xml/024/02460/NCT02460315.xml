	<detailed_description>The aim compare early versus delay laparoscopic cholecystectomy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography patient gall bladder stone calcular obstructive jaundice regard operative difficulty , conversion rate , sign inflammation , degree adhesion , blood loss , postoperative morbidity , hospital stay . Moreover , bacterial examination bile culture sensitivity test assessment bacterial colonization relate degree colonization time laparoscopic cholecystectomy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , decide upon optimal timing surgery . The study population divide 2 group ; group ( A ) manage early laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) within 3 day ERCP group ( B ) manage late LC one month ERCP .</detailed_description>
