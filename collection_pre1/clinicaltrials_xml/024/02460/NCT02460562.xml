	<brief_title>Caries Prevention Effect S-PRG Filler Incorporated Denture Base Resins Edentulous Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design 1.5-year , double blind randomize clinical trial , 150 volunteer 35-60 year age wear palatal removable partial denture contain with/without S-PRG filler . This study perform 3 local government hospital locate around Bangkok metropolitan , Ministry Public Health , Thailand . The subject assign control group ; resin denture base contain without S-PRG filler experimental group ; resin denture base contain 20 % weight S-PRG filler . Two parameter measure ; ( 1 ) Salivary fluoride level , access different time point ; day 1 , 14 , 15 3 , 12 month wear denture , ( 2 ) Caries incidence use ICDAS-II , take 18 month . Regarding agreement participate dentist dental assistant hospital , patient wait list removable partial denture screen accord eligible criterion . If meet eligibility criterion , complete description follow : `` If agree participate study , today 's visit ask question medical dental health medication presently take , whether use fluoride supplement except toothpaste . You answer every question . The dentist brief examination mouth look see decay . You able participate study obvious untreated tooth decay . Following completion questionnaire examination , simple test saliva . We collect stimulate saliva chew piece wax 5 minute . You spit saliva form 5 minute cup . We measure volume saliva produce . You normal flow rate participate . Collecting information , saliva test , complete dental examination take 30 minute today 's appointment . You may refuse participate saliva test answer question item questionnaire . If case , qualify study . If qualify agree take part , dentist take mold mouth make upper resin denture replace miss teeth wear . This routine dental procedure . Some subject may gag mold take denture . The dentist method help control gag reflex . Depending group assign , resin denture make standard material standard material contain new type biological material . This new material testing use formulation dental product filling material . At next appointment , approximately two week later , come denture fit . Slight discomfort may occur gum margin denture pinch . The plate adjust relieve pinching . On rare occasion , allergy resin denture base may occur . We stop participation study allergy resin denture . We give resin denture need wear day exclude sleep night . You must take brush teeth . You may clean denture water toothbrush use brush teeth keep denture denture storage box . We want use anything else denture except material supply . You receive box keep denture , toothbrush toothpaste brush teeth home . At first 14 day receive denture , want soak denture denture storage box contain tap water every night sleep . After supply tube fluoride gel store denture instead tap water . We ask apply gel ( approximately 1 cm length ) denture spread totally side denture keep denture box sleep every night 1.5 year . After wear denture , ask return clinic check-up recall . We collect saliva wearing denture periodically total six time within one year accord schedule analysis fluoride level . At 1.5 year , ask return clinic dentist dental examination follow-up . That conclude participation study . We assess salivary fluoride different time point 1 year . The fluoride level saliva show u capability new material fluoride release recharge . The follow period extend 6 month . The caries information collect 1.5 year show u incidence new caries . All procedure do dental clinic hospital . The subject identify number assign . The principle investigator project coordinator access code remain locked time . The saliva collect subject discard immediately complete analysis . The sample size assessment consider base long term outcome , caries incidence , short term outcome , salivary fluoride concentration , study . The optimal sample size address outcome study allow 20 % drop rate would 75 subject per group ( 150 total ) provide sufficient statistical power detect difference mean caries incidence control intervention group . Collected data enter computer database analyze STATA software version 12 Windows . The statistical significance level set α = 0.05 . The analysis plan salivary fluoride level phase follow base two-sample test linear regression adjust confounders ( age , number remain teeth ) . Data analysis caries incidence record per surface use ICDAS-II severity score 1.5 year . The caries outcome define score 1 6 1 2 root caries . Two-sample test linear regression adjust age perform assess different control intervention group mean number new surface caries ( dmfs ) ± standard deviation 1.5 year follow-up examination .</detailed_description>
