	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Motor symptom associate Parkinson 's disease may impair one 's independence ability perform daily activity consequently decrease quality life . Hippotherapy show effective treatment improve function daily activity quality life neurological population , thus study conduct assess effect hippotherapy people Parkinson 's disease . METHODS : Nine volunteer form treatment group participate ten-week hippotherapy program , nine individual form control group ( attend ten-week series lesson Parkinson 's disease ) . Outcome measure include 30-second chair stand ( measure strength-endurance ) , gait velocity ( 10m walk test ) health-related quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) associate motor symptom bradykinesia , rigidity postural instability 1 interfere patient 's independence , ability carry activity daily life 2 . In addition , loss functional may result decreased health-related quality life ( HRQL ) 3 . Thus , PD progress HRQL get bad 4 . Exercise program suggest improve functional capacity HRQL people PD 3 . However , later stag PD , mobility problem restrict potential participate exercise program , result even great loss functional capacity HRQL . Furthermore , decline efficacy pharmacological treatment complication due motor fluctuation medication side effect make role complementary treatment hippotherapy critical individual PD late stage . Hippotherapy therapeutic intervention commonly use population mobility deficit , since require effort walk patient exercise stand position . When horse , patient exercise he/she walk unassisted 5 . Neurological condition improve horse 's movement stimulation . The set form patient horse performs rhythmic three-dimensional oscillation trigger important neuromuscular response rider 's postural reflex mechanisms 6 . The horse 's movement sense participant saddle , horse slowly walk argue similar pelvic movement produce human gait , thereby strengthen trunk muscle improve balance 7 . The sens integrate act rid perform sensory stimulation 8 . Furthermore , hippotherapy demonstrate effective method improve functional capacity increase gait velocity people brain disorder 9 , functional mobility elderly 10 functional strength people stroke 11 people spinal cord injury 5 . In addition , hippotherapy show improve HRQL child adults 6 . Considering potential benefit hippotherapy anticipatory postural adjustment sensory stimulation 9 , 11 , could hypothesize hippotherapy may increase functional capacity improve HRQL individual PD . This hypothesis test yet . Therefore , purpose study assess effect hippotherapy program functional capacity HRQL people PD . ( 4 ) Methods Subjects People confirm diagnosis PD medical report invite advertisement radio , television , public announcement poster around hospital participate Physical Activities Program Persons Neurodegenerative Diseases . Among 81 register volunteer , 18 participant , six woman twelve men , unable perform usual physical activity late stage accord Hoehn Yahr scale ( H &amp; Y≥ 3 ) , need use wheelchair severe mobility problem enrol hippotherapy program form sample ( n=18 ) . Exclusion criterion uncontrolled hypertension , unstable cardiovascular disease practice rid hippotherapy six month intervention period . Among 18 volunteer sample , three woman six men randomize intervention group call hippotherapy group ( HT ) ( n=9 ) , perform ten week hippotherapy session ( 2 familiarization + 8 hippotherapy week ) twice week session last thirty minute . Nine participant wait allocated hippotherapy program follow semester attend lecture PD , twice week ten week , session last thirty minute . Demographics characteristic sample see Table 1 . This study approve Research Ethics Committee University Brasilia 10/10/2013 number CAAE 17329213.7.0000.0030 . All participant inform procedure agree participate study sign informed consent term . Instruments Quality life measure use Parkinson 's Disease Quality Life Questionnaire ( PDQL ) Brazilian version 4 . Functional mobility evaluate Timed Up Go Test ( TUG ) accord Podsiadlo Richardson 12 . Strength endurance measure use Thirty-second Chair Stand Test ( 30CST ) accord Gill McBurney 13 . Gait velocity evaluate use Ten Meter Walk Test ( TMW ) accord Bohannon , Andrews Thomas 14 . All functional test three trial 2 minute interval trial , average two last measurement use analysis . Hippotherapy Procedures Familiarization session initially 15 minute gradually evolve 30 minute order allow participant adapt horse 's rhythmic movement act mount horse . The session perform First Regiment Cavalry Guard Brazilian Army . All practitioner use helmet , shirt , pant close shoe . The team compose auxiliary guide , physical education teacher two auxiliary . In order mount dismount , participant use specific ramp hippotherapy class . All horse use saddle rid equipment , stirrup individually adjust . The session begin 5 minute warm involve stretch body awareness exercise . Then , train conduct 20 minute arm torso exercise , change direction call serpentine movement ; hip movement foot stirrup , force expiration . In final 5 minute , exercise relaxation conduct horse involve move hand horse 's neck , lay forward head stroke horse . The horse walk speed 5.8 6.4 Km/h . In order ass effect hippotherapy difference post pre-tests score dependent measure calculate ( delta ( ∆ ) ) . To assess whether data normal distribution Shapiro-Wilk test use , indicate normal distribution functional capacity variable . Thus , Mann-Whitney U test independent sample use order compare change functional capacity group . The Shapiro-Wilk test demonstrate normal distribution PDQL variables data , parametric statistic perform one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Statistical analysis perform use program Statistica 7.0 ( StatSoft Inc. , Tulsa , Oklahoma , USA ) , adopt significance level p≤0.05 .</detailed_description>
