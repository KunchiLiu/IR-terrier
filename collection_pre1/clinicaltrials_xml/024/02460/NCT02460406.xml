	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate effectiveness progressive functional strength training protocol ( functional squat system virtual reality leg press , plyometric exercise , exercise Bosu ball &amp; heel-rise exercise ) Body Functions activity child unilateral spastic Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) apply current guideline . According literature , study investigate effect functional strength training child CP . But randomize control trial , explore effect progressive functional strength training protocol body function activity unilateral spastic CP . Hypothesis study progressive functional strength training protocol improve performance-related physical fitness , gross motor function , dynamic , balance , muscle tone muscle strength unilateral spastic CP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Progressive Functional Strength Training Unilateral Spastic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) describe group disorder development movement posture , cause activity limitation , attribute non-progressive disturbance occur develop brain . It common cause movement disability childhood . Children CP may experience variety impaired muscle function , spasticity , muscle weakness , loss selective motor control . Muscle structural change cause activate mechanism limited function grow maturation . The weakness find child CP attributable alter neural mechanism muscle tissue change . Several factor affect level weakness find muscle child CP . First , weakness may differ proximal distal limb muscle . Stackhouse et al . find maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) impair plantar flexor quadriceps child mild CP compare control . Second , peak torque may vary accord velocity limb movement . Peak torque knee flexor extensors 24 child CP find decrease increase velocity isokinetic machine . Third , peak torque may vary accord muscle length . An isokinetic study 44 child young people CP find peak torque hip abductor occur muscle lengthen position leg still adduction . Fourth , type contraction find consistently affect peak torque child CP typically develop , eccentric force great concentric force muscle . Although impaired muscle function limit performance daily life activity participation child CP , recent study show muscle weakness show strong association mobility limitation child CP spasticity . Strength train child , therefore , expect improve maintain strength functional performance .</detailed_description>
