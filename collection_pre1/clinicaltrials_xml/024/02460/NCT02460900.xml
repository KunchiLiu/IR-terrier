	<brief_title>Optimizing Smoking Cessation People With HIV/AIDS Who Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose factorial design strategy evaluate effect , individually combination , promise pharmaco- behavioral cessation therapy available PLWH accord review extant literature HIV-infected general population smoker . The sizable cohort prospective design also permit u evaluate effect tobacco use , treatment , cessation panel soluble biomarkers inflammation likely contributor cardiac morbidity mortality people live HIV/AIDS . The specific aim proposal : Primary Aim 1 : Compare varenicline placebo rate 7-day point prevalence abstinence ( PPA ) 24 week smoker HIV/AIDS . We hypothesize rate smoke abstinence week 24 high treat varenicline compare placebo . Primary Aim 2 : Compare Positively Smoke Free low intensity , brief counsel rate 7-day PPA 24 week smoker HIV/AIDS . We hypothesize rate smoke abstinence week 24 high treat Positively Smoke Free compare brief counsel . Primary Aim 3 : Compare Positively Smoke Free + varenicline two study condition outline rate 7-day PPA smoker HIV/AIDS 24 week . We hypothesize effect PSF varenicline great effect PSF varenicline alone . Secondary Aim : Explore effect successful cessation/smoking abstinence level cardiac specific biomarkers , nicotine biomarkers , generalize marker inflammation , lipid , coagulation monocyte/macrophage activation . We hypothesize smoke cessation associate significant reduction level biomarkers monocyte/macrophage activation .</detailed_description>
