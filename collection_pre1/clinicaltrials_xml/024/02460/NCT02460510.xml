	<brief_summary>Patients ALF ( Acute liver Failure ) would undergo detailed clinical evaluation . Information would collect regard onset duration symptom , etiology , severity disease , baseline clinical feature , demographic characteristic , routine biochemical hematological investigation . Patients would also screen assessment raise intracranial hypertension either clinical neuroimaging ONSD ( optic nerve sheath diameter ) TCD ( Transcranial doppler ultrasonography ) . Patient find rise ICP ( Intra Cranial Pressure ) would randomize two group study . The group A would receive intravenous mannitol 20 30 minute every 4 hourly group B would give 3 % hypertonic saline continuous infusion rate 25ml /hr titrate q4 hr per slide scale achieve target serum sodium level 144-155 mmol/L .Both group would receive supportive measure head end elevation , oxygen supplementation , dextrose infusion maintain normoglycemia standard medical treatment .</brief_summary>
