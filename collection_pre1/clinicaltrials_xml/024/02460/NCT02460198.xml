There two cohort study : Cohort A Cohort B . For Cohort A , participant require previously treat standard therapy , must include fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan . Enrollment Cohort A complete . For Cohort B , participant require previously treat least one line systemic standard care therapy : fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidine + irinotecan +/ - anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) / epidermal growth factor regulator ( EGFR ) monoclonal antibody .</brief_summary>
