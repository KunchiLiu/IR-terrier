	<brief_summary>1 . To determine low nasal cannula flow rate upper airway deadspace reduce . Hypothesis - The low flow rate high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) reduce upper airway ( extrathoracic ) deadspace improve respiratory efficiency reduce transcutaneous CO2 and/or low respiratory rate . 2 . To determine low nasal cannula flow rate regional distribution ( define EIT ) ventilation change . Hypothesis - Moderate high flow rate create positive pressure lead improved regional distribution ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects High Flow Nasal Cannula Deadspace Reduction Regional Distribution Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Historically , oxygen nasal cannulae use hypoxemic patient therapy increase arterial oxygenation . In neonatal community , oxygen flow &gt; 2 L/min &gt; 4 L/min pediatric patient seldom use due potential excessive drying nasal mucosa risk develop hypothermia . It speculate large pediatric adult patient able good tolerate flow rate excess 4 L/min large nasal mucosal surface area support hydration dry medical grade gas . High flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) therapy form respiratory support provide flow believe excess patient 's spontaneous inspiratory expiratory flow rate . In last decade , proliferation heated-humidified high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) device introduce clinical setting . These device intend provide optimal heat humidification medical gas regardless flow set . In case neonate , predominant patient population receive HFNC , clearly consensus flow constitute `` high '' population . If `` high '' intend mean flow rate exceeds spontaneous inspiratory flow rate reasonable clinical measurement ascertain relationship . Thus , true definition HFNC remain elusive term protocol hop shed light subject . Our prospective randomize trial effect 3 different oxygen nasal cannula flow rate ( low , medium , high ) respiratory rate , SPO2 , transcutaneous CO2 regional distribution ventilation measure EIT help clinician define range HFNC flow rate deadspace washout occurs without positive distending pressure ( low range ) deadspace washout occur positive pressure create regional distribution ventilation change . C. Preliminary Studies One neonatal source defines HFNC flow &gt; 1 L/min another defines flow &gt; 3 L/min HFNC.1 Classification complicate large pediatric adult patient flow HFNC report excess traditionally use standard nasal cannula ~ 6 L/min ) high 30-40 L/min.2 With technologic ability provide good heat humidity , clinician find HFNC may able support large fraction patient would otherwise require continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) , invasive mechanical ventilation . There several propose mechanism HFNC may provide great respiratory assistance standard oxygen delivery device . Flows exceed expiratory flow rate may provide `` back-pressure '' nasal airway open exhalation similar nasal CPAP . Additionally , gas may provide physiologic purge carbon dioxide anatomic dead space via anatomic leak ( nasal/oral airway ) . These effect likely vary base flow , minute ventilation , patient size , leak , nasal airway opening/prong size relationship . There currently three FDA approve HFNC system . Clinical acceptance relate fact HFNC less expensive , simple operate require less complicated airway interface standard CPAP NIV device . Another propose benefit HFNC prongs generally less occlusive may cause less nasal airway injury CPAP prong BiPAP mask . The widespread acceptance use approach implement little experimental data support HFNC flow setting safe effective option patient hypoxic respiratory failure . Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) Electrical impedance tomography capitalize change impendence air-filled versus tissue-filled space characterize quantify regional distribution lung volume bedside . This technology validate animal3 human4 , 5 study perform past decade Boston Children 's Hospital . The technology utilizes series 16 electrode place across patient 's chest ( Figure 1 ) . As small current pass electrode , impedance measure amongst series . Through complex interrogation manipulation impedance value , two-dimensional image form ( Figure 2 ) , show correlate clinical radiographic change patients4 . The ability estimate lung volume regional distribution gas non-invasively real time may give u insight mode ventilation effective . Physiologic effect safety HFNC There several propose physiologic mechanism HFNC believe effective . These include : 1 ) flush upper airway deadspace CO2 , allow good alveolar gas exchange ; 2 ) provide flow adequate support inspiration therefore reduce inspiratory work breathing ; 3 ) improve lung airway mechanic eliminate effect drying/cooling ; 4 ) reduce eliminate metabolic cost gas conditioning ; 5 ) provide positive expiratory distending pressure . While variable measure either animal human , short-term study enrol small number subject specifically design address safety HFNC . Hasan et al observed effect pressure generate static neonatal lung model use two commercially available HFNC device flow 0-12 L/min different leak settings.6 They demonstrate naris model leak minimize ( mouth close ) systematic increase simulate tracheal pressure proportional increase flow . The measured airway pressure similar report nasal CPAP ( ~5-6 cmH2O flow ~6-8 L/min ) . Frizzola colleague measure tracheal pressure gas exchange 13 lung-injured neonatal piglet support N-CPAP HFNC high-leak low-leak conditions.7 The major finding study HFNC tracheal pressure comparable CPAP pressure flow range , washout nasopharyngeal dead space associate improved ventilation oxygenation independent tracheal pressure alone HFNC . A number short-term study evaluate magnitude distend pressure lung small group infant . Sreenan et al find similar end expiratory pleural pressure could maintain standard oxygen delivery nasal cannula ( 1-2.5 L/min ) N-CPAP group 40 premature infant difference desaturations , bradycardia , apnea.8 However , pressure likely highly variable due leak airway/cannula size relationship . Lampland observe similar end-expiratory pleural pressure HFNC ( 2-6 L/min ) N-CPAP 6 cm H2O premature neonates.9 A recent Cochrane meta-analysis evaluate prospective , randomize control trial limit premature infant population.1 The primary objective meta-analysis determine safety efficacy HFNC . When used primary respiratory support birth , one trial find similar rate treatment failure infant treat HFNC ( 5-6 L/min ) nasal CPAP.10 Following extubation , one trial find infant treat HFNC ( 1.8 L/min ) significantly great need reintubation treat nasal CPAP.11 Another trial find similar rate reintubation humidify non-humidified HFNC ( ~ 2-3 L/min ) 12 fourth trial find difference two different model equipment use deliver humidify HFNC ( 6 L/min ) .13 There patient enrol study two study ( Woodhead , Miller ) poor methodological approach use . In one study enrollment stop short due infection relate HFNC device used.10 Based finding , insufficient evidence establish safety effectiveness HFNC within range commonly use flow , form respiratory support preterm infant . Also , data demonstrate use follow extubation , HFNC may associate high rate reintubation nasal CPAP.14 There study evaluate safety efficacy large infant pediatric patient . Despite lack support evidence , HFNC still implement many pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) use flow ≥ 20 L/min adult study conduct use high flow HFNC . Thus , difficult extrapolate finding promote use similar flow child . It apparent HFNC may provide clinical benefit CPAP even NIV less complicate nasal airway naso-oral interface . While nasal CPAP serve intermediary form support oxygen therapy invasive ventilation neonate , common large pediatrics adult support bi-level NIV alternative invasive ventilation . There compel data also support use NIV neonatal population augment ventilation effect nasal CPAP . HFNC provide baseline pressure similar CPAP also augment alveolar ventilation level may similar NIV . D. Design Methods 1 . Study Design .
