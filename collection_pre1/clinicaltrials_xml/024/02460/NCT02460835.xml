	<brief_summary>This pilot single arm study primary endpoint feasibility preliminary estimate safety efficacy . This protocol build 25 year experience high dose liver RT ( Radiation Therapy ) , particular adaptive RT aim adjust global radiation dose base patient 's measured sensitivity treatment . This current protocol use functional image specialized radiation planning technique spare highly functional portion liver preserve function . The investigator feel improve safety efficacy RT patient customize treatment . If approach promising , investigator proceed phase II randomize study standard versus spatially dosimetrically adapt RT .</brief_summary>
