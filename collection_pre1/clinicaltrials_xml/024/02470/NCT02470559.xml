	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose activate T-cell therapy give together low-dose aldesleukin sargramostim treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer stage III-IV , respond previous treatment , come back . Activated T cell coat bi-specific antibody , anti-cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor , sargramostim , may increase production blood cell . Giving activated T-cell therapy low-dose aldesleukin sargramostim may better treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Perform phase I clinical trial consist dose-escalation/de-escalation intraperitoneal ( IP ) infusion anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu ( HER2Bi ) arm anti-CD3 activated T cell ( aATC ) woman high risk recurrent ovarian cancer determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) IP injection combination fix intravenous ( IV ) dose 10 x 10^9 ( ± 20 % ) aATC week . II . To clearly define toxicity profile IP IV HER2Bi aATC MTD technically feasible dose patient ovarian cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate clinical response , time progression , overall survival . II . Evaluate phenotype , cytokine profile interferon ( IFN ) -gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOTS ) , cytotoxicity antibody direct laboratory ovarian cancer cell line . III . Monitor cancer antigen ( CA ) 125 tumor marker , antibody response mouse protein ( human anti-mouse antibody [ HAMA ] ) . IV . The migration arm ATC peritoneal serum cytokine level induce IP IV arm ATC infusion assess study appearance arm ATC various time point ( 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour IP infusion ) blood IP infusion perform flow cytometry detect anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) x anti-Her2 ( Herceptin® ) bi-specific antibody ( BiAb ) surface aATC . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study IP infuse HER2Bi-armed activate T cell . Patients receive HER2Bi-aATC IV 5-15 minute IP within 3-4 day IV dose weekly 4 week . Patients also receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) daily sargramostim SC twice weekly begin 3 day first HER2Bi-aATC infusion infusion end 7 day last HER2Bi-aATC infusion . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month , every 6 month .</detailed_description>
