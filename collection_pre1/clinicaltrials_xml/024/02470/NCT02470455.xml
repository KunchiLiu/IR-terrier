	<brief_title>Effect Atorvastatin Glycemic Control Prediabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes grow public health problem throughout world , threaten global health economic prosperity . Currently , approximately 171 194 million people world diabetes , majority case Type II . This number expect increase 330 million year 2025-a record double within single generation . India 62.2 million diabetic patient fast become diabetes capital world possibility number diabetic patient reach 80 million mark 2030 . Every sixth diabetic world Indian . China 43.2 million patient come second , follow US 26.8 million people suffer disease . This spectacular increase frequency Type II diabetes parallel similarly alarm increase obesity , one major risk factor Type II diabetes . Because close linkage two condition , Ziv Shafrir suggest term `` diabesity '' describe association . This dual epidemic largely ignore public health community recently come great surprise involve enormous economic burden well term health . Disorders glucose metabolism associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) complication , include coronary , peripheral cerebral arterial disease , account majority morbidity mortality among patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . Type II diabetes commonly associate dyslipidaemia , represent synergistic risk factor cardiovascular disease . The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATP III ) list diabetes coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk equivalent set therapeutic goal LDL cholesterol . A goal LDL cholesterol &lt; 100 mg/dl recommend patient CHD CHD risk equivalent . For majority patient diabetes , LDL cholesterol goal would evoke use cholesterol-lowering drug , particularly statin . Some Interventional study emphasize statin treatment lead reduction cardiovascular event independent lipid reduction possible benefit patient Type II diabetes . Statins could also contribute diabetes prevention owe lipid-lowering so-called pleiotropic action . Statins improve endothelial function , inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation , reduce oxidative stress inflammation . Thus , recent FDA approve indication statin widen , statins currently amongst widely use drug patient without diabetes . Although statin therapy reduces cardiovascular risk , relationship development diabetes controversial . Retrospective analysis West Scotland Coronary Prevention Study ( WOSCOPS ) reveal 5 year treatment pravastatin reduce diabetes incidence 30 % . The author suggest although lower triglyceride level could influence diabetes incidence , mechanisms anti-inflammatory action may involve . On contrary , pravastatin decrease diabetes incidence another trial include glucose-intolerant human , suggest early inception statin therapy may require effective diabetes prevention . Likewise , simvastatin affect diabetes incidence patient atherosclerosis Heart Protection Study . In contrast , atorvastatin marginally increase diabetes incidence Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial ( ASCOT-LLA ) , could explain statistical variation . A recent review 13 study Naveed Sattar , et al . publish The Lancet 2010 , statins side-effects include total 91,140 participant suggest use statin associate increase risk Type II diabetes 9 % . However researcher meta-analysis stress study prove statin directly raise risk Type II diabetes , raise possibility either direct indirect link statin diabetes merit investigation . Thus , explore role statin initiation progression diabetes mellitus exciting area investigation .</detailed_description>
