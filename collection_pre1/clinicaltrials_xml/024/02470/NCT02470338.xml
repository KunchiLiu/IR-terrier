	<brief_summary>This study show investigator believe Modified Brostrӧm Procedure complete without routine ankle arthroscopy . Routine ankle arthroscopy , determine necessary case , waste resource term operate room , surgeon , staff time well cause increase hospital financial expense . Most importantly , procedure morbid . Ankle arthroscopy force patient 's foot distraction one hour , expose patient potentially long anesthesia exposure unnecessary , increase infectious risk , require exposure portal site near superficial nerve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Brostrӧm Procedure With Without Possible Arthroscopy Lateral Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose investigation determine ankle arthroscopy necessary treatment routine ankle instability without evidence intra-articular pathology MRI . Our study population include individual whose ankle MRI inconclusive negative intra-articular pathology , intra-articular ankle pain predominant presenting symptom . Although current practice WBAMC conduct ankle arthroscopy group patient , debate literature whether arthroscopy conduct . Thus , purpose study examine MBP without ankle arthroscopy .</detailed_description>
