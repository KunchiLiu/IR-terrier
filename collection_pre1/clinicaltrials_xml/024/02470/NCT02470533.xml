	<brief_summary>Rationale : This study compare head head patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ineligible surgery radiofrequency ablation , standard treatment arm , transarterial chemoembolization drug-eluting bead ( TACE-DEB ) , experimental arm , stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . The investigator hypothesis time progression favorable SBRT TACE-DEB . The expected time include require patient trial four year . To best investigator knowledge study first world compare technique randomize trial . Objective : To assess time progression TACE-DEB SBRT comparable population patient diagnose HCC . Study design : Randomized , prospective , open-label , phase II study . Study population : Patients diagnose HCC , Child-Pugh grade A , one tumor ( 2 satellite lesion ) ≤ 6cm , ≥ 18 year old . Intervention : Patients HCC randomize receive standard treatment , TACE-DEB load doxorubicin experimental arm , SBRT . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint study time progression , define time randomization radiological progression . Secondary endpoint : - Time local recurrence - Response rate ( complete partial response ) - Overall survival - Toxicity - Quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization Versus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary liver cancer , particularly hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major health problem . Curative therapy HCC consider hepatic resection , liver transplantation radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . Hepatic resection prefer patient limited disease , non-cirrhotic liver select patient Child-Pugh A cirrhosis . Unlike resection , liver transplantation treat tumor underlie cirrhosis present liver . Candidates liver transplantation preferably cirrhosis tumor comply Milan criterion ( single tumor &lt; 5cm 1-3 tumor ≤ 3cm ) . Because patient amenable resection liver transplantation , RFA emerge effective treatment option . RFA limit location tumor liver tumor size best result RFA achieve tumor ≤3cm . For patient eligible RFA due large multifocal tumor , transarterial chemoembolization drug-eluting bead ( TACE-DEB ) prefer treatment . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) deliver highly effective dose irradiation tumor maximally avoid dose delivery surround healthy structure . SBRT offer ablative local treatment report high percentage complete partial response limited toxicity . An international expert committee HCC recommend time progression ( TTP ) primary endpoint phase II randomize trial . Although data scarce best publish median TTP TACE-DEB 16 month SBRT 36.5months less comparable patient population ( Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage system A-C ) . The present study include patient eligible resection RFA . Patients may eligible bridge stag transplantation . Well compensate liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh A ) disease confine liver ( one tumor two satellite ≤ 6cm ) require . To knowledge trial first world compare TACE-DEB SBRT . This trial may big impact control disease may contribute change standard care palliative radical/curative intention patient population</detailed_description>
