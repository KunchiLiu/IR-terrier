	<brief_title>FAST Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold device/drug combination product provide mechanical structure vascular lumen support ( scaffold component ) pharmacological agent ( everolimus ) target toward reduce injury response lead restenosis scaffold implantation . The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold intend improve luminal diameter subject ischemic heart disease due de novo native coronary artery target lesion ≤ 12 mm length reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.75 mm ≤ 3.25 mm . Subjects candidate PCI treatment de novo native coronary artery lesion screen accord protocol inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects consider enrol sign informed consent form attempt make implant fully absorbable study scaffold . During index procedure 1 target lesion de novo native coronary artery may treat . Up 1 non-target lesion separate epicardial vessel may treat commercially approve DES</detailed_description>
