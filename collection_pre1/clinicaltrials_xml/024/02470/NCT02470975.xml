Second , CC consider `` we-family disease '' , , stressor affect patient , parent interaction within family member subsystems , since interdependent unit . Third , high survival rate increase chronicity CC demand ongoing adaptation whole family illness-related stress . As , several study find association family child variable cancer treatment , study suggest causal relationship family function child adjustment quality life ( QoL ) . Nevertheless , ( 1 ) family dimension related process stress , appraisal cop CC , ( 2 ) change ( 3 ) divergence within dimension predict child QoL time , remain answered . Research stress cop couple identify two crucial dimension well relational health outcome potential provide answer . `` We-Appraisals '' , process individual tend evaluate happens couple , i.e. , relational-oriented way ( `` '' problem ) individual way ( `` I/you '' problem ) ; Dyadic Coping , i.e. , process couple cope together stress . Therefore , aim expand understand dimension context family cop CC . Aims Using three-wave longitudinal design , investigator aim examine ( 1 ) role parental we-appraisals we-disease appraisal , couple parent-child dyadic cop child 's QoL time , ( 2 ) variable change time change predict change child 's QoL , ( 3 ) congruence discrepancy within we-appraisals we-disease-appraisals , couple parent-child dyadic cop predict change child 's QoL time , ( 4 ) observe parental we-appraisals , partner 's parental ex-pressed emotion predict child ' QoL . Hypothesis The investigator expect high score parent ' variable predict positive change child QoL first 12 month cancer diagnosis ( T2 T3 ) . The investigator expect change discrepancy within parent ' variable time predict change child QoL T2 T3 . Methods One hundred child newly diagnose cancer mother father recruit University Children 's Hospitals Zurich Berne assess three time 12 month . The child interview time point .
