	<brief_title>Denosumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether denosumab therapy either increase disease control rate 4 month patient recurrent measurable osteosarcoma compare historical Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) experience denosumab therapy produce objective response rate great 5 % ( Cohort 1 ) . II . To determine whether denosumab therapy increase disease control rate 12 month patient recurrent resect osteosarcoma compare historical COG experience ( Cohort 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) denosumab subject recurrent osteosarcoma . II . To describe tolerability denosumab subject recurrent osteosarcoma . III . To report disease control rate objective response rate patient recurrent osteosarcoma limited bone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate biological marker potentially associate response denosumab patient recurrent osteosarcoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 ( day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 4 week ( 28 day ) 24 month 26 course , whichever occur first , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
