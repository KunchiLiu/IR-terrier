	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose stereotactic body radiation therapy use intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) plan help avoid radiation normal tissue patient prostate cancer . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy send x-ray directly tumor use small , high dos radiation several day may cause less damage normal tissue . This treatment schedule allow high dose radiation administer short overall treatment period comparison standard radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Boost Using Urethral-Sparing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate incidence genitourinary ( GU ) gastrointestinal ( GI ) acute late toxicity patient treated prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) simultaneous integrative boost , urethral ring sparing , enhance prostate localization ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI\-computed tomography [ CT ] fusion ) . II . To also evaluate incidence GU GI acute late toxicity patient treated prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) conventional uniformly deliver dose 7.25 Gy/fraction prostate . III . Disease-free survival : disease-free failure event include local progression , distant progression , biochemical failure define Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) Phoenix definition , death cause . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate patient quality life ( QOL ) use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26 ( EPIC-26 ) evaluation QOL 3 year completion SBRT . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . Patients unable undergo MRI , whose MRI prove technically inadequate delineating need anatomic structure , decline enroll Arm A assign Arm B . ARM A : Patients undergo 5 fraction moderate dose SBRT simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) every day 10 day follow urethral-sparing IMRT planning . ARM B : Patients undergo 5 fraction uniform dose SBRT every day 10 day follow undergo urethral-sparing IMRT planning . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , 4 , 8 , 12 month , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
