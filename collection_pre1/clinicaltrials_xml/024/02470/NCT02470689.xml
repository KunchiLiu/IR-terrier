	<brief_summary>Epidermolysis bullosa simplex type Dowling-Meara ( EBS-DM ) one severe subtypes EBS . Blisters erosion skin mucous membrane upon minor trauma consequence dominantly inherit mutation either keratin 5 ( K5 ) keratin 14 ( K14 ) gene , encode protein constitute intermediate filament ( IF ) network basal keratinocytes . Autosomal dominant mutation lead conformational change increase self-aggregation protein . Upon stress , aggregate present periphery cytoplasm , subsequently lead disintegration collapse IF network . Clinically , patient suffer blister skin mucous membrane upon minor trauma , result impaired life quality due pain pruritus . In vitro study Dowling-Meara keratinocytes reveal significant upregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta ( IL-1ß ) . Apart paracrine effect IL-1ß upon wound ( e.g . attraction lymphocytes , activation dermal fibroblast ) , IL-1ß also activate keratinocytes via cjun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) stress pathway . The activation pathway lead activation number transcription factor enhance transcription number gene , like matrix metalloproteinases , kallikreins , also IL-1ß K14 . Interestingly , state activation constitutive also find keratinocytes non-lesional site . It seem upregulation IL-1ß K14 presence dominant Dowling-Meara mutation , result positive feedback loop , potentially aggravate EBS-DM phenotype . This strongly corroborate fact impair IL1ß signaling , use IL-1ß neutralizing antibody ( IL-1Ab ) small molecule diacerein , expression level IL-1ß K14 decrease keratinocytes much less susceptible heat shock vitro . Furthermore , activation level JNK widely correlate expression level K14 IL-1ß . ( Wally V et al , 2013 ) . These finding lead hypothesis block IL-1ß also lead amelioration EBSDM phenotype effect patient . Based previous vitro finding diacerein choose topically apply pilot study five patient suffer EBS-DM . In study , participant receive 1 % diacerein-cream one armpit , placebo ( randomize withdrawal ) . The number blister reduce significantly ( leave : -78 % ; right : -66 % baseline ) within two week remain significantly initial level even withdrawal four patient . These finding point relevant effect diacerein provide important information confirmative study . Diacerein component rhubarb root , report block release active IL-1b inhibiting plasma membrane-bound IL-1 converting enzyme . Diacerien already approve systemic application osteoarthritis . In general , small molecule ( SM ) low molecular weight compound biological function influence molecular process . They allow symptomatic treatment , offer short-term benefit patient term amelioration phenotype . Although kind treatment correct genetic alteration , still highly beneficial damp disease symptom , thereby increase life quality minimize secondary manifestation . It important emphasize besides dressing , currently treatment , therefore , investigator prevent accepted treatment patient risk participant . The treatment give armpit although disease involve area , stop dressing armpit study risk patient . Should deterioration patient , whether related treatment diacerein , investigator stop use diacerein .</brief_summary>
