	<detailed_description>Oritavancin approve United States treatment adult patient acute bacterial skin skin structure infection ( ABSSSIs ) cause suspect caused susceptible isolates designate Gram-positive microorganism . The purpose study determine ( ) safety tolerability ( b ) pharmacokinetic profile multiple dose Oritavancin give 7-8 week period . Cohort 1 consist 14 subject , randomize receive total four dos either oritavancin placebo , give every two week double-blind fashion . After completion cohort 1 , Data Safety Monitoring Board review blind safety data pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cohort 1 determine whether continue cohort 2 , modify cohort 2 end study . The cohort study sequential . Cohort 2 consist 14 subject , randomize receive total eight dos either oritavancin placebo ( 4 subject ) give every week double-blind fashion .</detailed_description>
