	<brief_summary>A clinical trial plan study effect cannabis dystonia spasticity child neurological disease . The clinical trial include 40 child divide two group : child spasticity dystonia due cerebral palsy , child spasticity dystonia due genetic neurodegenerative disease . Each group randomly divide two arm receive Avidekel cannabis oil 6-to-1 ratio CBD THC enrich Avidekel cannabis oil 20-to-1 ratio CBD THC . During study , various variable collect include : medication intake , spasticity , dystonia score , pain scale , restlessness scale , quality life measure , safety test , side effect , addiction test . The investigator hypothesize cannabis consumption reduce dystonia spasticity child motor disability relate genetic neurodegenerative disease cerebral palsy result improve motor function , non-motor function quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect two cannabis oil contain main cannabinoid Δ9 -THC CBD ratio 1 6 1 20 ( respectively ) , spastic movement disorder dystonia . 40 child enrol study divide 2 group : 1 . Children spasticity dystonia due cerebral palsy 2 . Children spasticity dystonia due genetic neurodegenerative disease Each group randomly divide two group : I . Active comparator : 6-to-1 ratio CBD THC oil II . Active comparator : 20-to-1 ratio CBD THC oil During study follow variable collect : - Consumption drug \ medication intake - Spasticity grade measure use Modified Ashworth Scale - Dystonia grade measure use Barry Albright Dystonia Scale - Patient 's subjective report severity his/her spasticity and/or dystonia - Pain scale - Restlessness scale - Quality life measure : function , sleep , mood , appetite , weight - Safety test : liver function , renal function , blood test ( complete blood chemistry ) , blood pressure , pulse , ECG - Side effect - Addiction test The purpose study : 1 . Efficiency - examine effect cannabis dystonia spasticity . 2 . Examining effective cannabinoid ratio relief dystonia spasticity . ( Δ9 -THC CBD ratio 1 6 1 20 , respectively ) . 3 . Examining effect cannabis quality life measure ( medication intake , mood , appetite , sleep ) . 4 . Safety : examination side effect unwanted effect cannabis limitation . Research Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize cannabis consumption reduce dystonia spasticity symptom child motor disability relate genetic neurodegenerative disease cerebral palsy result improve motor function , non-motor function quality life .</detailed_description>
