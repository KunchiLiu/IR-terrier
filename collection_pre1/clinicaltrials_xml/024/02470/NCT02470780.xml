	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient motor fluctuation screen presence Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth ( SIBO ) use two hydrogen breath test . SIBO-positive individual eligible enroll , randomize receive either rifaximin placebo . This study include two treatment regimen ( include placebo control ) , design patient receive active drug point trial . Motor outcomes follow 3 6 month follow enrollment , depend treatment arm subject assign . The primary endpoint ass effect rifaximin treatment decrease `` '' time SIBO-positive PD patient . This pilot study support design large , randomize control trial investigate effect SIBO eradication reduce motor complication PD patient motor fluctuation . The current proposal design demonstrate ability detect treat SIBO PD patient motor fluctuation , inform selection best SIBO detection method , determine optimal timeline assess motor endpoint , estimate duration benefit treatment .</detailed_description>
