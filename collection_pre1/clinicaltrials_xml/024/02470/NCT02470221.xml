	<detailed_description>The study conduct patient undergo either laparotomy gynecological malignancy orthopedic surgery Peking Union Medical College Hospital . The study include two stage . In first stage , one cohort 100 participant conventional fluid therapy involve , 50 patient select laparotomy gynecological malignancy 50 patient select orthopedic surgery . All participant stage follow conventional fluid therapy direct amount intraoperative fluid . Specifically , fluid administer base principle crystalloid solution ( colloid solution =2-3:1 ) . The total volume fluid adjust accordance blood pressure , heart rate urine output patient . It standard procedure Peking Union Medical College Hospital . Then , incidence postoperative complication group record . In addition , sample size estimate base study 's result ( estimate 100 participant ) . In second stage , goal-directed therapy apply another cohort 200 participant , 100 patient undergoing laparotomy gynecological malignancy 100 patient undergoing orthopedic surgery . Specifically , fluid administer base upon real-time monitoring stroke volume variation cardiac output achieve Flo-Trac monitoring system . The incidence postoperative complication group record .</detailed_description>
