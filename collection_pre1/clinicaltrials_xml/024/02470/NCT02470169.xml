	<brief_title>Stimulated Versus Un-stimulated Intrauterine Insemination Cycles Women With Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometriosis define presence endometrial like tissue ( gland stroma ) outside uterus , induce chronic inflammatory reaction . The exact prevalence endometriosis unknown estimate range 2 10 % woman childbearing age . Its prevalence rise 50 % woman infertility . In subfertile patient moderate-to-severe endometriosis , anatomy pelvic cavity disturb result impaired ovum retrieval diminish patency Fallopian tube , make IVF first choice fertility treatment . However , patient surgically treated endometriosis normal function ovum retrieval patency least one Fallopian tube establish , intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) provide prior IVF . The application ovarian stimulation IUI advocate , even woman ovulatory cycle , improve pregnancy rate IUI . However , application ovarian stimulation two main drawback : The increased chance multiple pregnancy ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome . To avoid complication unstimulated IUI cycle investigate . The objective study evaluate role stimulate unstimulated IUI cycle woman endometriosis . The study conduct Cairo university hospital BeniSuef University hospital All patient laparoscopic document endometriosis attend site invite participate study . The study explain couple sign write consent include study . Four hundred fifty woman endometriosis divide 3 equal group use computer generate random number : Group 1 4 stimulate IUI cycle , group 2 4 unstimulated cycle , woman become pregnant 4 cycle group 1 2 advise regular intercourse expect time ovulation . Group 3 control group advise regular sexual intercourse time ovulation 6 month On 3rd day menstruation group 1 vaginal ultrasound receive daily intramuscular 150 IU human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG , Merional ® , IBSA , Lugano , Switzerland ) start 3rd day menstruation . On day 8 ultrasound repeat serum E2 measure , hMG dose adjust continued frequency ultrasound scan individualize . HMG stop least 2 follicle measure 18 mm associate serum E2 500-3000 Pg/mL , follow administration 10000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ; Choriomon® , IBSA ) Women group 2 ask test morning urine specimen luteinizing hormone daily start 4 day expect day ovulation . This do use qualitative kit . Intrauterine insemination perform day surge urinary excretion luteinizing hormone . Women group 3 ask test urine luteinizing hormone method group 2 . They ask intercourse day surge urinary excretion luteinizing hormone repeat 12 month . Semen specimens group 1 2 evaluate prepared IUI within one hour collection . Semen dilute 1:2 ( vol/vol ) HEPES-buffered Ham 's F10 medium contain 1.5 percent serum albumin . After centrifugation 10 minute , pellet re-suspended combined 3 ml medium . The sperm suspension centrifuge 10 minute , pellet resuspend 0.35 ml medium . Approximately 0.05 ml use determine concentration motility sperm . The remain sample drawn shepherd catheter attach 1 mL syringe inject uterus . The procedure repeat 4 month group 1 2 , pregnancy occur . Women conceive 4 trial ask check urine luteinizing hormone use ovulation detection kit intercourse day follow luteinizing hormone surge . This repeat 8 month . The pregnancy rate 3 group compare 4 month one year .</detailed_description>
