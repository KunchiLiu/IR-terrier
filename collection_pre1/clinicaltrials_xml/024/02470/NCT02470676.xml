	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize control trial determine whether cervical pessary plus vaginal progesterone superior vaginal progesterone alone decrease preterm delivery rate , improve perinatal outcome , among woman present asymptomatic mid-pregnancy short cervix , singleton twin gestation . All woman singleton twin pregnancy undergo routine ultrasonography 24 complete week gestation ( examination fetal anatomy growth ) diagnose cervical length ≤25 mm singleton , ≤38 mm twin , invite participate clinical trial . Women meet eligible criterion invite participate clinical trial . Women randomly assign one follow group : group A ( vaginal progesterone ) group B ( vaginal progesterone + pessary ) . Follow-up visit ultrasound assessment fetal growth cervical length carry every two week 37 week gestation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Pessary v Vaginal Progesterone Preventing Preterm Birth Among Women Presenting With Short Cervix : An Open-label Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth represent major challenge obstetrician well healthcare policy maker . It lead cause perinatal morbidity mortality among singleton multiple pregnancy . In USA , frequency preterm birth ( &lt; 37 complete week gestation ) 10-13 % singleton pregnancy , 57 % twin rate substantially change last decade . A short cervix ( &lt; 25 mm ) measure vaginal ultrasonography mid pregnancy ( 18-24 week gestation ) powerful predictor spontaneous preterm birth ( PTB ) . The relative risk PTB increase cervical length decrease . The two study treatment option case short cervix mid pregnancy vaginal progesterone preparation , cervical cerclage . Vaginal progesterone , give either 90 mg gel 200 mg suppository , repeatedly show significantly reduce PTB rate perinatal morbidity mortality woman find short cervix ( 20 mm less ) 24 week gestation . Progesterone proven ineffective prevention preterm birth case multiple gestation , present preterm labor , preterm premature rupture membrane . Cerclage may consider alternative vaginal progesterone woman history PTB find short cervix present pregnancy ( cervical length &lt; 25 mm 24 week gestation ) . According recently publish indirect meta-analysis , vaginal progesterone cerclage equally efficacious prevention PTB woman singleton gestation , mid trimester sonographic short cervix , history previous preterm birth . Unfortunately , vaginal progesterone cervical cerclage proven effective prevention PTB twin gestation . Moreover , cervical cerclage context may even lead bad outcome compare conservative treatment . Additionally , contrast singleton pregnancy , neither vaginal progesterone injection 17alpha-hydroxyl-progesterone caproate prevent neonatal morbidity preterm birth multiple pregnancy . One meta-analysis suggest vaginal progesterone mid trimester short cervix twin gestation may improve neonatal outcome without prolong pregnancy . Cervical Pessary renovate method , currently study clinical advantage exist available treatment context midtrimester asymptomatic short cervix singleton twin gestation . The large multicenter randomize control trial ( RCT ) pessary use select woman screen Trans Vaginal Sonography ( TVS ) exclude woman one following : know major fetal anomaly , painful regular uterine contraction , active vaginal bleeding , rupture membrane , placenta previa , history cone biopsy cervical cerclage situ . The conclusion study woman short cervical length ( &gt; 25mm ) 18-22 week , use cervical pessary significantly prolong pregnancy reduce rate poor neonatal outcome compare control , untreated patient . A second , small , RCT fail corroborate finding previously describe . In study , mean gestational age delivery 38.1 week pessary group compare 37.8 week expectant management group , significant difference rate delivery 28 , 34 37 week gestation . Currently , publish RCT compare efficacy cervical pessary cerclage progestogens short cervix singleton twin . A retrospective comparison method show significant difference rate perinatal loss , neonatal morbidity PTB singleton pregnancy ( apart high rate PTB &lt; 34 week ' gestation vaginal progesterone v pessary group ) . In 2003 , first case control study twin pregnancy cervical pessary conduct . Twenty-three woman short cervical length ( &lt; 25 mm ) prior 24 week gestation treat pessary match 23 control . The mean gestational age delivery 35+6 week pessary group 33+2 week control group ( p value=0.02 ) . A large RCT publish 2013 include 403 woman twin pregnancy randomize either prophylactic pessary expectant management . Women cervical length include . The author conclude prophylactic use pessary unselected twin pregnancy prolong pregnancy reduce poor perinatal outcome . However , sub group analysis woman cervical length le 38 mm ( &lt; 25th percentile ) , significantly low incidence poor neonatal outcome , delivery 32 week , neonatal mortality find pessary group .</detailed_description>
