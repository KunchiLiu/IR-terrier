	<detailed_description>Electronic cigarette ( EC ) nicotine delivery device generate nicotine-containing aerosol inhale user . EC perceive user useful help quit smoke conventional tobacco cigarette ( TC ) well presume low risk adverse health effect compare TC , potential use public place , reduce cost , lack noxious cling odor associate TC use . Many believe electronic cigarette ( EC ) function nicotine delivery device way tobacco cigarette ( TC ) , EC prove addictive TC , may case fundamental difference design method use product . Investigators hypothesize systemic nicotine exposure low EC compare TC ; despite low nicotine intake EC user experience similar reward great withdrawal symptom crave compare TC ; dual EC/ TC user titrate daily intake nicotine way TC smokers high- vs low-yield nicotine TC . Investigators specifically focus area think closely relate addictive potential EC , namely : ( 1 ) EC nicotine delivery device , cover issue nicotine intake pharmacokinetics , temporal pattern use titration nicotine ; ( 2 ) subjective effect EC use , include relationship use reward , withdrawal craving . The investigator also examine aspect safety EC use ( assessment cardiovascular hormonal effect use biomarkers exposure potentially toxic constituent ) explore identification validation biomarkers may useful distinguish EC TC use . Study subject dual user TC EC investigator may compare modality use experienced user within-subject design . The study consist two 1-week block ( EC-only TC-only condition ) 4 day outpatient ad libitum product use follow 3 day clinical research ward include single-use pharmacokinetic study , monitor product use , subjective assessment , blood urine collection ass biomarkers , 24-hour period cardiovascular monitoring . Two additional day end 2nd block ass similar measurement period nicotine-product abstention .</detailed_description>
