	<detailed_description>The purpose study calculate sensitivity specificity novel image device associate software algorithm detect early stage melanoma versus nevi skin . The instrument , invent PI , purpose study , loan three external ( Rockefeller ) institution use patient schedule biopsy pigmented lesion . The purpose correlating output screen result novel device output diagnosis gold standard histology analysis procedure two diagnosis compare generate number true positive , true negative , false positive false negative novel device . The purpose disseminating device external institution achieve appropriate power specificity evaluate 99 % sensitivity . The rationale power need study order clinically useful , device need extremely sensitive ( i.e . 99 % ) false negative diagnosis dangerous situation , lead potential progression melanoma , deadly form skin cancer . The scientific hypothesis diagnostic mechanism superficial melanoma light tissue interaction occur blue shift wavelength ( i.e . blue light , ultra violet light ) superficial epidermis mechanism diagnosis deeper melanoma ( i.e . Breslow depth &gt; 0.5mm ) light/tissue interaction occur red shift light ( i.e . red light , infrared light ) portion pigment lesion lie within dermis . These hypothesis fuel initial observation diagnostic sensitivity specificity wavelength dependent study look red , green blue wavelength available traditional digital dermoscopy imaging . The initial finding multiple feature analyze , feature statistically significant diagnostics blue channel ( relative minority ) feature fare well red channel . It hypothesize diagnostic feature well red channel feature deep melanin superficial region , theoretically atypical ALL melanoma , evident quantitative endpoint metric generate blue channel .</detailed_description>
