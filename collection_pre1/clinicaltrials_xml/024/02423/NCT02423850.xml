	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulcer venous leg ulcer constitute increase health problem Denmark concurrent age population increase diabetes prevalence . Diabetic foot ulcer belong serious costly complication . Several study find size depth ulcer one major etiologic factor delay heal . Wound measurement important monitoring wound heal process . For last decade different 3D technique measure ulcer propose order measure ulcer volume , none technology widely use . A 3D photo-optical camera develop , able measure ulcer area volume . The investigator hypothesize volumetric measurement diabetic foot ulcer venous leg ulcer feasible assessment ulcer healing . A prospective cohort study conduct newly admit patient diabetic foot ulcer venous leg ulcer include first visit polyclinic . The patient follow one year complete ulcer healing , amputation death . Ulcer area volume measure 3D camera frequent interval . Patient anthropometrics ulcer data collect study correlate ulcer healing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method Newly admit patient diabetic foot ulcer venous leg ulcer include first visit polyclinic . The data mention gather first visit follow examination perform include 3D photo . The ulcer area ulcer volume estimate photo 3D camera . The ulcer examination repeat 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 52 week heal ulcer . Ulcer heal estimate use change ulcer size per time unit . Patients treated standard ulcer treatment method unaffected project per se . During trial different method treatment note include change initial treatment . The variable quantify one year depend time heal , establishment chronic ulcer ( non-healing one year ) amputation perform . At baseline follow patient data collect : - Demographic data : gender , age - Smoking habit - Time period onset ulcer first visit polyclinic - Body Mass Index - Comorbidity use Charlson Comorbidity Index score - Type diabetes , duration diabetes - Diabetic complication include retinopathy , albuminuria , coronary heart diseases neuropathy The following examination perform baseline : - Blood pressure measurement - Peripheral blood pressure - Examination neuropathy use monofilament - Blood sample patient diabetic foot ulcer The clinical examination ulcer perform baseline 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 52 week heal ulcer : - Size wound ( surface area , volume ) measure 3D camera - Location ulcer - Classification ulcer : granulation , necrosis , epithelialisation - Secretory potential - Foot deformity - Bone affection - osteitis suspect x-ray take - Signs infection The different type ulcer treatment register every ulcer : - Type bandage - Antibiotics ( local , systemic ) - Revision ( method , frequency ) , - Surgery Effect variables - Ulcer volume surface area - Percentage change volume surface area 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 52 week - Ulcer texture ( e.g . granulation , black/yellow necrosis ) Endpoints - Healing ulcer - Amputations - Chronicity ulcer ( non-healing 1 year ) - Death cause Significance This project seek clarify whether 3D photo ulcer provide accurate structural measure illuminate background delayed ulcer healing , thereby create platform evidence base treatment algorithm .</detailed_description>
