	<brief_summary>Through multinational pooled dataset approach , trial aim derive validate specific vivo Corneal Confocal Microscopy ( CCM ) parameter threshold identification diabetic polyneuropathy , - importantly - identification individual future risk . Results study permit application clinical practice intervention trial diabetic polyneuropathy ( DPN ) risk stratification . The primary goal study re-examine individual type 1 type 2 diabetes without neuropathy , CCM perform past part neurological examination , assess concurrent predictive validity different CCM parameter individual . These subject invite study re-examined CCM along neurological test ( physical exam , nerve conduction study , quantitative sensory testing , blood test centre also skin biopsy ) single study visit . Additionally CCM data analyze manually recently develop automate analytical software evaluate accuracy automate method . Evaluation automate image analysis influence likelihood successful knowledge translation surrogate biomarker DPN clinical practice - procedure could harmonize annual retinal examination - intervention trial . Secondary aim study determine factor associate CCM parameter longitudinal change collect bio-samples future research field .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diffuse injury peripheral nerve ( diabetic neuropathy ) exceptionally common type 1 diabetes , lack objective surrogate marker identify early subclinical stage treatment might effective , prior late-stage progression troublesome costly foot infection , ulceration , limb amputation . In contrast ability objectively measure disease-specific surrogate marker retinopathy nephropathy , lack diabetic neuropathy surrogate marker seriously impede development specific intervention clinical research trial . Representing 5 independent research group together create consortium investigator dedicate development surrogate marker early diabetic neuropathy , focus use eye window non-invasively image method in-vivo corneal confocal microscopy ( CCM ) small nerve fibre innervate cornea . We demonstrate change nerve fibre ending occur early development neuropathy , reflect well change see peripheral nerve invasive skin biopsy evaluation , measurement feasible reproducible . As multinational consortium , benefit proposal pool multiple cohort apply valid study method biomarker development . First , aim determine analysis exist pool dataset 516 type 1 524 type 2 diabetes subject exact level CCM measurement identify presence diabetic neuropathy . Secondly , propose three year re-examine least 70 % cohort , provide 5- 7-year follow-up data determine type level CCM measurement predict future onset neuropathy , well progression neuropathy baseline . Finally , evaluate role time- cost-saving automate image analysis software . By virtue large sample size data pooling , uniquely afford methodological power confirm objectives way separate derivation validation analysis set . Through unique unprecedented multinational pool dataset approach diabetic neuropathy , work derive validate specific CCM parameter threshold identification neuropathy , - importantly - identification individual future risk . These result permit application clinical practice intervention trial neuropathy risk stratification . Evaluation automate image analysis influence likelihood successful knowledge translation surrogate biomarker clinical practice - procedure could harmonize annual retinal examination - intervention trial .</detailed_description>
