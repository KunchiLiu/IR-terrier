	<brief_summary>OCT provide high-resolution information regard anatomic structure tissue eye 2-dimensional 3-dimensional view . Much information able recognize clinician . Utilizing information surgery allow ophthalmic surgeon well understand surgical procedure impact anatomic structure eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PIONEER : Intraoperative Perioperative OCT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last decade , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) become critical component evaluation ophthalmic disease . Similar ultrasound , OCT use light reconstruct image tissue interest . In effect , OCT become function light biopsy , allow clinician visualize subtle pathologic change tissue , macular edema subretinal fluid . The use OCT clinic set become standard monitoring disease macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy . It quickly become frequent ordered diagnostic test ophthalmology . Due restraint size structure image equipment , use OCT operating room limit . More recently , modification OCT table-top model well development hand-held OCT probe allow translation OCT technology operate room . The high resolution anatomic information gain OCT image natural complement ophthalmic surgeon . Using OCT vitreoretinal surgery reveal subtle change microarchitecture retina disease retinal detachment , macular hole , optic pit , previously know . Using OCT lamellar corneal transplant procedure , anterior segment surgeon able image proper placement graft previously unattainable standard surgical microscopic view . Using information gain OCT , surgeon may able improve surgical decision make improve clinical outcome . For study , subject undergoing ophthalmic surgery , include vitreoretinal surgery anterior segment surgery , would OCT image performed perioperative period , intraoperative period , document architectural change ocular tissue . This information would prospectively collect review association anatomic functional outcome . A microscope-mounted OCT system use assess feasibility utility image ophthalmic surgical milestone .</detailed_description>
