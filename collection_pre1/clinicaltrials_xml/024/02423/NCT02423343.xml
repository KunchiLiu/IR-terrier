	<criteria>For Phase 1b , must advance refractory solid tumor line therapy . In Phase 2 few 3 NSCLC , HCC glioblastoma participant include Phase 1b , safety runin must occur cohort few 3 participant Phase 1 . For Phase 2 , must one follow tumor type : recurrent refractory NSCLC ( histology ) , HCC elevate alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) â‰¥200 nanogram/milliliter ( ng/mL ) , glioblastoma ( primary ) . For Phase 2 , disease progression refractory intolerant 1 prior line therapy ( first line therapy ) recurrent refractory NSCLC , HCC glioblastoma refuse currently approve secondline therapy . First line therapy define therapy use treat advanced disease . This may include multiple chemotherapeutic , targeted immunotherapeutic agent without radiation therapy and/or surgery . Each subsequent line therapy precede disease progression . A switch agent within drug class ( eg , cisplatinum carboplatinum ) within regimen order manage toxicity define start new line therapy . For NSCLC : Prior line therapy must include platinumbased therapy . Investigational agent use combination standard therapy allow . Participants receive platinumbased neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy subsequently receive platinumbased therapy firstline therapy eligible . Participants complete neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy platinum doublet experience disease recurrence within 6 month complete platinum doublet eligible . Tumors driver mutation ( epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive ) treat tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib eligible . For participant progressed tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib intolerant target therapy , participant must receive platinumbased therapy prior enrollment study . Documentation mutation must available enter electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . Maintenance switch maintenance therapy firstline chemotherapy consider part firstline regimen acceptable . Participants complete progressed platinumcontaining regimen adjuvant , neoadjuvant , part course chemoradiation therapy give locally advanced disease develop recurrent ( local metastatic ) disease within 6 month screen would count receive 1 prior platinumcontaining regimen therefore would require retreatment platinumcontaining regimen Stage IIIB , IV , recurrent disease eligible . However , participant must receive least 2 cycle platinum doublet base chemotherapy discontinuation toxicity . If participant receive one cycle platinum doublet discontinue due clear progression , regimen count prior line therapy . For HCC : One prior line therapy must include sorafenib participant must progress intolerant sorafenib participant eligible transarterial chemoembolization . Participants sorafenib locally advanced disease intolerant sorafenib eligible . Participants may clinical progression follow sorafenib local therapy . Must ChildPugh A . Participants may viral status ( hepatitis B , hepatitis C , none ) . Have viral load &lt; 100 international units/milliliter ( IU/mL ) . For hepatitis B participant , must nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( lamivudine , telbivudine , adefovir , tenofovir , entecavir ) . For Glioblastoma ( GB ) : Previous first line therapy least radiotherapy temozolomide except participant O6methylguanineDNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) unmethylated newly diagnose GB . Participants MGMT unmethylated newly diagnose GB may receive radiation therapy . Have adequate organ function . Have performance status 0 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Use approve contraceptive method . Have moderate severe cardiovascular disease : Have presence cardiac disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association Class III/IV congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension . Have document major electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities clinically significant investigator 's discretion ( example , symptomatic sustain atrial ventricular arrhythmia , second thirddegree atrioventricular block , bundlebranch block , ventricular hypertrophy , recent myocardial infarction ) . Have major abnormality document Echocardiogram Doppler ( example , moderate severe heart valve function defect and/or leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % , evaluation base institutional low limit normal ) . Have predispose condition consistent development aneurysm ascend aorta aortic stress ( example , personal history aneurysm location , family history aneurysms location , MarfanSyndrome , bicuspid aortic valve , evidence damage large vessel heart document compute tomography [ CT ] scan/magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] contrast ) . Have evidence interstitial lung disease symptomatic may interfere detection management suspect drugrelated pulmonary toxicity active , noninfectious pneumonitis .</criteria>
