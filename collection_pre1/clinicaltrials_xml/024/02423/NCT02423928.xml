Autologous dendritic cell obtain leukapheresis elutriation stimulation cytokine . The induced dendritic cell pass viability , immunophenotyping sterility criterion inject cryoablated region primary prostate cancer tumor .

	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Trial Cryoimmunotherapy Against Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study treatment dendritic cell ( ACT2001 ) inject prostate follow prostatic cryoablation . It speculate antigen cryoablated cancer available vicinity cryoablation field immediately following procedure . Autologous , immature dendritic cell capable internalize antigen , migrate lymphatic system , present antigenic epitope T lymphocytes . In way , dendritic cell capable initiate cell-mediated systemic immune response . In concept , cancer provide specific potentially broad spectrum cancer-related antigen . Regulatory T lymphocytes , implicate dampen halt cell-mediated , antigen-specific immune response , selectively deplete use regimen low-dose cyclophosphamide . Low-dose cyclophosphamide empirically show selectively deplete number circulate regulatory T cell . The second half patient addition receive treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab antibody one additional measure avoid cancer cell immune evasion . Using combination therapy , think clinically significant anti-cancer immune response might elicit .</detailed_description>
