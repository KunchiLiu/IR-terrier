	<detailed_description>Cycle 1 , Weeks 1 8 • Weeks 1 2 ( Days 1 , 3 5 two week ) study subject receive prim treatment course , consist total 6 IT injection 0.5 mg Poly-ICLC lesion . A pre-treatment biopsy day first IT injection prior injection . One readily accessible tumor site target intra-tumoral injection Poly-ICLC . - Weeks 3-5 , study subject receive boost treatment course , consist IM injection Poly-ICLC twice weekly . A second biopsy perform prior , within 7 day follow last injection cycle 1 . The pre-designated injected target lesion biopsied . - Weeks 6-8 rest period treatment . A third biopsy target lesion perform prior , within 7 day last IT injection cycle 2 . Cycle 2 , Weeks 9 16 - Weeks 9 10 study subject receive second priming treatment ( IT injections thrice weekly 10 ) . - Weeks 11-13 study subject receive boost treatment course 1 mg Poly-ICLC IM injection twice weekly . The second cycle IT injections may target different metastatic site discretion investigator , give cycle target one site repeat injection . - Weeks 14-16 rest period treatment . If clinically indicate , per standard care , week 16 study subject may CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis extremity neck assess response , use Immune relate Response Criteria ( irRC ) . MRI brain may also obtain part clinical follow disease , per standard care . Study subject possible progression inflammatory pseudoprogression disease significant functional decline keep study discretion investigator . Cycle 3 , Weeks 17 26 - Weeks 17 18 study subject receive third priming treatment ( IT injections thrice weekly ) . - Weeks 19-21 study subject receive another boosting treatment course 1 mg Poly-ICLC IM injection twice weekly ) The third cycle IT injections may target different metastatic site discretion investigator , give cycle target one site repeat injection . - Weeks 22-26 rest period treatment allow evaluation response week 26 , absence possible drug induce acute inflammation Maintenance Therapy Week 27 36 • Weeks 27 36 study subject complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) may offer maintenance therapy administration 1 mg IM Poly-ICLC twice weekly . At week 36 repeat tumor assessment , include optional tumor biopsy , perform . Follow Period : • After completion treatment subject may contact telephone twice yearly 36 month inquire health status ( e.g. , alive , dead , remission , progressive disease , new cancer treatment ) . Study subject initial tumor response long-term recurrence follow period may offer additional cycle treatment depend subject 's health status , cost and/or drug availability .</detailed_description>
