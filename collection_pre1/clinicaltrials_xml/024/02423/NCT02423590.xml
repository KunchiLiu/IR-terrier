	<brief_summary>This study carry see new drug call Apatorsen combination standard gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy effective treat squamous cell lung cancer . This study part research project collect information effectiveness safety Apatorsen use gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy . The main purpose study see Apatorsen , combine gemcitabine/carboplatin , effective treatment squamous cell lung cancer . Recent research find protein call Hsp27 help cancer cell protect effect cancer treatment . Hsp27 find lung cancer present , cancer drug might work well would without Hsp27 present . Blocking action Hsp27 remove Hsp27 cancer cell Apatorsen may slow stop cancer grow . This study therefore look relationship Hsp27 level tumour blood effect treatment . The development Apatorsen intend provide new treatment option patient cancer . Apatorsen may also make cancer sensitive gemcitabine carboplatin make chemotherapy treatment effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gemcitabine/Carboplatin First-line Chemotherapy +/- Apatorsen Advanced Squamous Cell Lung Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicentre , 2-arm randomise phase II trial gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen ( OGX-427 ) versus gemcitabine/carboplatin alone patient previously untreated advanced squamous cell lung cancer . Patients randomise ( 1:1 ) one two treatment arm : - Gemcitabine/carboplatin - Gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen ( OGX-427 ) Randomisation stratify follow criterion : - Stage ( IIIB versus IV versus recurrent disease ) - Performance status ( 0 1 versus 2 ) Gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy continue 4-6 cycle unless evidence unacceptable toxicity , disease progression , patient request study treatment discontinue withdrawn study . If chemotherapy discontinue prior disease progression , patient combination arm continue Apatorsen ( OGX-427 ) single agent therapy disease progression unless evidence unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal consent termination study , whichever occur first . All patient follow disease progression . Tumour evaluation perform initiation treatment every 6 week completion chemotherapy . Once disease progression document , patient enter Survival Follow-up Period data collect every two month regard cancer therapy , secondary malignancy survival status . The study also assess relationship anticipate anti-tumour activity treatment regimen biological characteristic patient ' tumour baseline .</detailed_description>
