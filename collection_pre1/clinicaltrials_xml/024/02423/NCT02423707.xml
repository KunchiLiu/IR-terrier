	<brief_summary>Allergen-specific immunotherapy ( ASIT ) commonly use treat patient allergic rhino-conjunctivitis asthma , proven treatment affect long-term development allergic rhinitis asthma . The current treatment regime ASIT require numerous subcutaneous allergen injection take several year complete . Hence , need develop convenient protocol induction allergen tolerance . Emerging evidence suggest target antigen present cell within lymph node immunogenicity allergen enhance number injection reduce . The purpose study evaluate whether intralymphatic administration ASIT safe effective treatment patient pollen-induced allergic rhinitis . The long term goal provide base efficient administration ASIT , reduce dose necessary number clinic visit associate conventional subcutaneous ASIT . The investigator make attempt reproduce result recent human study intralymphatic ASIT ( clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT00470457 ) Swedish clinical setting . The first part study complete publish ( PMID : 23374268 )</brief_summary>
