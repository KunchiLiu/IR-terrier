	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study epidural anesthesia within enhanced recovery pathway ( ERP ) reduce pain patient undergo gynecologic surgery . An epidural analgesia ( pain relief ) small tube place low back numbs nerve stop feel pain . It stay place several day surgery may helpful pain control patient gynecologic cancer surgery . ERP set specific step use , , surgery health care provider care patient surgery . ERPs include patient education , use laxative surgery , increase activity surgery , schedule use medication pain nausea . Giving epidural anesthesia part ERP may improve pain control patient undergo gynecologic surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Mean postoperative pain score first 24 hour post-operatively , ( measure Numeric Rating Scale [ NRS ] , rate pain 1-10 scale , collect routinely post-operative floor ) compare epidural no-epidural group . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Total opioid use measure oral morphine equivalent first two day post-surgery . II . Length hospital stay ( measure hour admission time discharge order placement ) . III . Post-operative antiemetic use number record episodes emesis . IV . Return bowel function ( measure hour completion surgery passage flatus ) . V. Subject satisfaction 4 week post-operative visit ( measure two pain satisfaction question take Hospital Consumer Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems [ HCAHPS ] survey ) . VI . Post-operative complication ( urinary tract infection [ UTIs ] , thromboembolic event , pneumonia , blood transfusion , myocardial infarction , fall ) . VII . Readmission rate . VIII . Epidural discontinuation rate prior plan removal ( epidural group ) . IX . Stress inflammation serum saliva marker baseline first day surgery , well postoperative visit . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo epidural placement First Day Surgery pre-operative area similar area suitable insertion epidural catheter . In post-operative anesthesia care unit , patient may receive medication via epidural need basis , determine anesthesia team . Dosing rate standardize medication manage anesthesia team epidural remove . Patients complete ERP comprising increase activity , dietary restriction , fluid balance , well anti-nausea , anti-inflammatory pain medication specific time . Patients access additional pain medication need control pain . ARM II : Patients complete ERP comprising increase activity , dietary restriction , fluid balance , well anti-nausea , anti-inflammatory pain medication specific time . Patients access additional pain medication need control pain .</detailed_description>
