	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether peri-operative period neonates infant associated increase blood biomarkers , specific neuronal injury , correlate clinical variable sedative/analgesic agent . Patients , meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion , enrol . Blood sample measurement serum concentration marker ( S100-B Neuron-Specific Enolase ( NSE ) ) drawn surgery ( baseline ) 1-st , 2-nd 3-rd day surgery . During surgery cerebral oxygenation ( rSO2 ) monitoring continuously apply ; rSO2 , hemodynamic respiratory value simultaneously record every 5 minute . Anesthesia , pre postoperative treatment , include analgesia sedation , give per standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retrospective study show surgery infancy associate bad neurodevelopmental outcome , compare general population . The reason may complex , patient risk unknown . Brain growth central nervous system formation extremely active neonate infant . Metabolic circulatory derangement may negative influence develop brain . Disease perioperative period , may put population risk physiological abnormality . Near infrared spectroscopy show convenient method monitor cerebral tissue oxygenation surgery . The great majority anesthetic sedative drug , use perioperative period , show cause neuronal apoptosis experimental animal . Some study find neurological marker S-100B increase cerebrospinal fluid blood immediately follow anesthesia animal . Several clinical study support found child follow cardiac general surgery . The aim study ass dynamic S-100B protein pre- 72 hour surgery neonates infant age 1-93 day , operate abdominal/thoracic/urologic malformations/disease . As S-100B blood may extracranial source , simultaneously assess neuronal marker Neuron-specific Enolase .</detailed_description>
