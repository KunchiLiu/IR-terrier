	<brief_title>Composite Resin Plus Connective Tissue Graft .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel control clinical trial . Group CTG ( n = 18 ) - patient receive connective tissue graft treat gingival recession associate non-carious cervical lesion . Group CTG+RC ( n = 18 ) - patient receive connective tissue graft plus resin composite restoration treat gingival recession associate non-carious cervical lesion . The surgery , well postoperative follow-up , perform dental clinic ICT- UNESP . Two horizontal incision make right angle adjacent interdental papilla , without interfere gingival margin neighbor teeth . Two oblique vertical incision extend beyond mucogingival junction , trapezoidal mucoperiosteal flap raise mucogingival junction . After point , split-thickness flap extend apically , release tension favor coronal position flap.The expose root surface gently scale planed become smooth CTG group . For allocated CTG+RC group , sterile rubber dam place isolate operative field non-carious cervical lesion restoration perform nanocomposite resin ( Filtek Supreme - 3M ESPE - St. Paul , MN , USA ) , follow manufacturer 's instruction . Afterward , group receive thin small connective tissue graft suture root/restoration surface . Then , flap coronally position suture completely cover graft . Clinical parameter assess baseline 3 6 month post-operatively . Statistical Analysis The null hypothesis consider study absence difference clinical parameter different group . For data analysis , statistical program use ( Sigmaplot ) . The demographic clinical data compare group use Student 's t-test . The data first analyze homogeneity use Shapiro-Wilk test , indicate non-normal distribution . . Those present Shapiro-Wilk p value &lt; 0.05 analyzed use Friedman test ( intragroup comparison ) Mann-Whitney test ( intergroup comparison ) . Patients ' esthetic discomfort measure use VAS analyze T-tests . The frequency sit score good excellent group QCE analysis , frequency complete root coverage , BOP , presence absence plaque site compare use χ2 test . Intergroup RES comparison perform T-test . A significance level 0.05 adopt .</detailed_description>
