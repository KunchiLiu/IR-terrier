	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people advance heart lung disease heart lung transplant . But organ often reject . When happen , organ recipient must repeat biopsy . These invasive expensive . Researchers want see blood test predict rejection take place biopsy . The test show much donor DNA recipient blood . Objective : - To see new blood test use instead biopsy diagnose rejection transplant . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old lung heart transplant waitlist . Design : - Participants 4 teaspoon blood drawn arm transplant . - Researchers collect demographic data participant . They also collect basic medical information condition . - After surgery , still hospital , participant 2 teaspoon blood drawn twice week go home . - At biopsy visit transplant , participant 4 teaspoon blood drawn test 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute rejection ( AR ) occur within first 6 month transplantation 20 percent heart-transplant patient 50 percent lung-transplant patient . Given often silent clinical presentation AR , patient require monitoring repeat invasive costly endomyocardial ( EMB ) transbronchial biopsy ( TBBx ) . Since organ transplantation essentially genomic transplantation , prior study leverage use distinctive graft recipient genotype single-nuclear polymorphism ( SNPs ) barcode donor DNA circulate recipient serum . We show level donor DNA measure percentage circulate cell-free donor-derived DNA ( % ccfdDNA ) correlate AR diagnosis severity detect biopsy . The performance receiver operator curve ( ROC ) % ccfdDNA yield area curve ( AUC ) 0.83 . Using technique , diagnose AR measure elevation % ccfdDNA 5 month EMB-detected pathology . While finding suggest monitor % ccfdDNA may offer high-performing , non-invasive , early diagnostic tool AR , validation study require determine clinical utility . The ability diagnose AR earlier possible biopsy offer opportunity investigate pathogenesis rejection well identify potential AR biomarkers . Thus , primary objective study validate predictive accuracy ROC characteristic % ccfdDNA AR multicenter , prospective cohort study heart- lung-transplant patient , recruit consortium 5 transplant center Washington , DC metropolitan area . The secondary objective : 1 ) compare % ccfdDNA characteristic AMR ( antibody-mediated rejection ) ACR ( acute cellular rejection ) , 2 ) study early immunological change associate significant rise % ccfdDNA , 3 ) determine association early graft injury cause acute rejection infecton development chronic refection .</detailed_description>
