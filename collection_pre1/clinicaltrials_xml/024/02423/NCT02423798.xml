	<brief_summary>The trial investigate accuracy performance new sensor continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) , ( new generation ) Enlite , CE-marked 2013 , conjunction new Medtronic 640G system component . To evaluate accuracy performance new generation Enlite sensor . This postmarket , interventional , open-label , non-randomized , single center clinical research trial . The trial adopt prospective single-sample design use Yellow Spring Instruments ( YSI ) plasma glucose reference sample procedure clinic self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) plasma glucose reference sample procedure home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial investigate accuracy performance ( i.e . life-time ) new sensor CGM , ( new generation ) Enlite glucose sensor , CE-marked 2013 , conjunction new Medtronic 640G system component . Accuracy life-time sensor important parameter contribute safety patient patient acceptance still fairly new technology . The current trial investigates accuracy new sensor conjunction new 640G system component clinic home . This enable u assess sensor accuracy well-controlled environment use highly accurate laboratory glucose analyzer reference well sensor accuracy real-life condition use blood glucose meter reference analyzer . The data gather trial help understand effect technological advancement make guide future development glucose sensor continuous glucose monitoring .</detailed_description>
