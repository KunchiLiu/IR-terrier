	<brief_title>Strain Echocardiography Predict Cardiotoxicity Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Containing Doxorubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 . Determine 20 % reduction global longitudinal strain echocardiography predict subsequent composite cardiotoxicity collection patient either HER2 ( - ) breast cancer , sarcoma , lymphoma receive modern chemotherapy regimens contain anthracyclines . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Determine troponin I level least 0.08 ng/mL use high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay ( Hs-cTn-I ) predict composite cardiotoxicity . 2 . Determine serum B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level least 200 pg/mL predict composite cardiotoxicity . 3 . Determine independent predictor cardiotoxicity among clinical parameter , serial echocardiography strain measurement , biomarkers . Exploratory Objectives : 1 . Determine various pharmacogenomic factor predict composite cardiotoxicity . 2 . Determine independent predictor cardiotoxicity among clinical parameter , serial echocardiography strain measurement , biomarkers , pharmacogenomics marker . Study Procedures : Enrollment begin regulatory approval obtain . Potential patient identify treat oncologist . Eligibility criterion must confirm site staff . Patients meet eligibility criterion register Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office ( IUSCC-CTO ) prior first dose plan chemotherapy . Applicable regulatory document registration must complete file prior registration patient . A sign informed consent , complete eligibility checklist , support source documentation send IUSCC-CTO eligibility verification . Written inform consent obtain subject initiation study-specific procedure . Procedures perform part subject 's routine clinical management obtain prior sign inform consent may utilize screen baseline purpose provide procedure perform within timeframe specify protocol . Echocardiograms strain perform determine cardiac structure mechanical function course treatment . All echocardiograms include addition new signal ( sound wave ) processing method , call strain echocardiography . This technology allow precise analysis individual region heart determine cardiac function . Echocardiograms strain do four visit use GE strain-capable technology . Echocardiograms perform manner compatible strain calculation either GE Tomtec software depend software echocardiography lab experience use . The baseline echocardiogram within window 28 day prior start doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimen . The second obtained 1-4 week receive cumulative dose least 240mg/m2 another dose give . The third echocardiogram obtain 6 month ( +/-4 week ) start C1D1 . The final echocardiogram obtain 12 month ( +/-4 week ) start C1D1 . The first last echocardiogram complete study strain calculation 3D volume . The middle two study ( receive least cumulative 240mg/m2 doxorubicin 6 month start treatment ) limit study consist seven 2D image ( PLAX , APLAX , 4CH , 2CH , SAX-base , SAX-mid , SAX-apex ) strain calculation . Blood pressure record sonographers time every exam . Strain analysis IUH facility do online ( i.e . on-cart ) sonographer conclusion echocardiogram . Strain analyse institution may do off-line institution necessary software . As standard strain study , intraobserver interobserver reproducibility strain measurement perform portion test population . 20-25 % patient ' reproducibility study perform initial echocardiogram . For IUH study , follow initial examination sonographers recalculate strain image another strain sonographer recalculate strain image . Efforts make blind 2nd measurer result previous strain calculation . For non-IUH facility , process may perform offline use either sonographers staff echo reader . A maximum 11 mL blood drawn biomarkers visit 28 day prior begin chemotherapy , receive least cumulative 240 mg/m2 doxorubicin , 6 month ( +/- ) 4 week start chemotherapy , 12 month ( +/- ) 4 week follow start chemotherapy . Serum Troponin I BNP level draw interval echocardiograms . Blood sample also obtain patient pharmacogenomics . Preferably sample draw approximately time second echocardiogram/second set blood draw , obtain time study . Pharmacogenomic study largely exploratory consist TaqMan SNP genotype assay genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) annotate UGT1A6 , ABCB4 , ABCC1 , HNMT , SLC28A3 , FMO2 , SPG7 , SLC10A2 , SLC28A3 use germline DNA sample patient . In addition , employ next generation sequencing ( NGS ) approach use TruSight One Sequencing Panel base Nextera Enrichment DNA Sample Prep kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) target 4,813 gene 100X average coverage , 20X minimum coverage 95 % region panel . This targeted enrichment approach focus gene , limited HAS3 , CBR1 , CBR2 , involved cardiotoxicity , well gene cod protein involve heart cytoskeleton metabolism . Other high-throughput approach may also use . An electronic medical record review do research staff member patient enrol study . The following information collect medical record prior enrollment : - demographic include age , sex , race ethnicity - diagnosis include stage disease - previous treatment include radiation therapy mediastinum - previous medical concomitant medication history - performance status - height weight - plan ( previous ) chemotherapeutic regimen include dose ( mg/m2 ) doxorubicin - extent previous radiation therapy include site radiation dose deliver Upon completion final echo , interim information collect chart review subsequent visit include follow : - Vitals - Height weight - Total amount chemotherapy drug give - Medication change - ECOG Karnofsky Performance Status - New radiation therapy ( applicable ) - Presence new medical condition hypertension , hyperlipidemia , tachycardia A complete physical exam include vital sign , weight , measure activity level complete visit . Height collect pre-treatment visit . Body surface area calculate visit PI co-investigator ensure consistent equation use . All concomitant medication record visit except annual follow-up visit . Follow-up obtain investigator and/or study staff year begin 12 month ( +/- 2 month ) C1D1 5 year . Follow-up information obtain patient 's electronic medical record , call patient 's treat primary care physician , contact patient directly . Sample Size : The primary objective show change strain echocardiography parameter ( `` 240mg/m2 '' baseline ) associate 1-year event rate primary endpoint . Based exist literature , overall 1-year event rate 8 % targeted cancer population . We project 30 % population experience deteriorate echocardiography parameter ( risk group ) rest 70 % ( normal group ) stable value parameter . Previous study show normal group close zero event rate . Assuming event rate normal group 3 % thus event rate risk group 20 % , total 128 subject allow u 85 % power detect difference type I error rate ( one-sided ) control 0.05 . Alternatively , overall event rate low 5 % 1 % normal group 15 % risk group , use χ2 test still 85 % power detect difference . With 15 % attrition rate , recruit 128/0.85=150 patient . With project enrollment 6 patient per month , anticipate recruitment period 25 month . Statistical Analysis : Continuous baseline variable summarize typical parameter mean , standard deviation range compare use two-sample T test at-risk non-risk group ( normality assumption hold ) Wilcoxon rank-sum test ( normality assumption hold ) . Normality distribution determine use Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test . Categorical data summarize frequency percentage analyze use Chi-square Fishers exact test , appropriate . Logistic regression use analyze association change ( `` 240 mg/m2 '' baseline ) echocardiography parameter , biomarkers ( BNP troponin ) pharmacogenomics marker primary endpoint , separately . Pharmacogenomics measure consider exploratory . Logistic regression use study dosage effect primary endpoint . Multi-variable logistic regression use identify independent predictor among echocardiography parameter , biomarkers pharmacogenomics marker . If event rate 8 % , able perform multivariate analysis . However , event rate highly variable , substantially high event rate ( 16-20 % ) note recent study . If event rate 8 % , able perform multivariate analysis , 16-20 % , able fit multivariable model without overfitting . Hence , consider perform multivariate analysis event rate least 16-20 % . All analysis perform SAS SPSS . Strain cut-off level define risk vs. non-risk 20 % relative decrease global longitudinal strain . For secondary objective , cutoff value troponin ≥ 0.08 ng/mL time . For BNP cutoff value ≥ 200 pg/mL time . Data Safety Monitoring Plan : Investigators conduct continuous review data patient safety . Quarterly review meeting low risk trial require include PI member per PI 's discretion . Quarterly meeting summary review full IUSCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee time study review .</detailed_description>
