	<brief_summary>Anti-anginal drug relieve ischemia symptom reduce myocardial oxygen demand reduce heart rate contractility ( beta-blockers , phenylalkylamine benzothiazepineate class calcium antagonist ) vasodilatation venous system ( fall pre-load ) coronary vessel . Late sodium channel remain open long presence myocardial ischaemia . Ranolazine , novel anti-anginal agent , act inhibit inward late inward sodium current ( INaL ) , reduce intracellular sodium accumulation consequently intracellular calcium overload via sodium/calcium exchanger . It currently think reduction intracellular calcium reduce diastolic myocardial stiffness therefore compression small coronary vessel . There considerable animal data support theory . There good theoretical reason postulate patient chronically occlude vessel may derive less benefit conventional anti-anginal agent , particularly vasodilator . The ischemic myocardium , subtend occluded vessel , already subject significant concentration paracrine vasodilator adenosine . Ranolazine , therefore , may basis mechanism action , provide great relief ischemia patient conventional anti-anginal agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Ranolazine Patients With Chronic Total Occlusions Coronary Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test hypothesis , randomize study compare addition ranolazine addition minimum 2 conventional anti-anginal agent patient chronic total occlusion would require . To sufficiently power , would require significant number patient recruit multi-center trial . This study initial pilot study inactive placebo , addition conventional anti-anginal agent , control use MRI image data primary end-point .</detailed_description>
