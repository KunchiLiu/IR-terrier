	<brief_title>The Long-term Effect D4 Lymphadenectomy Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Gastric cancer second lead cause cancer-associated death worldwide , high incidence China . The prognosis advance gastric cancer quite poor . Although perioperative chemotherapy may help prolong survival case advance disease , radical tumor resection remain effective treatment curable gastric cancer . Nowadays , radical gastrectomy extend ( D2 ) lymphadenectomy become standard treatment advance gastric cancer . However , surgical procedure achieve radical tumor resection case advance disease . Hence , extensive ( D2 plus para-aortic nodal dissection , D4 ) lymphadenectomy along gastrectomy perform Japan Asian country . A recent study Sasako et al . indicate prophylactic D4 lymphadenectomy improve prognosis curable gastric cancer , increase blood loss operation time compare single D2 procedure . We review database , collect almost 2,000 gastric cancer case since establishment 1994 , find D4 surgical procedure actually improve prognosis T4 tumor tumor lymph node metastasis second station . To confirm result retrospective analysis , perform prospective study multicenter , open-label , randomized design affiliate hospital Sun Yat-sen University . This study would helpful improve prognosis patient advance gastric cancer , find efficient management curable gastric cancer . Method : This study , start January , 2011 plan close ten year , approve ethic committee Sun Yat-sen University , write inform consent obtain enrolled subject . Patients histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma confirm lymph node metastasis para-aortic node ( &lt; 3 enlarge lymph node ) prospectively enrol trial . A standard D2 lymphadenectomy D4 procedure randomly decide formal randomization program . The primary end point study overall survival , define time randomization death . The secondary end point recurrence-free survival , postoperative complication , length stay , hospital charge . Recurrence-free survival define time randomization first recurrence cancer death cause . The follow-up period would last least five year definitive operation . Significance : This study would confirm efficacy D2 plus para-aortic nodal dissection ( PAND ) procedure management advance gastric cancer compare classic D2 lymphadenectomy operation . Moreover , therapeutic measure employ current study may guide future treatment advance gastric cancer China .</detailed_description>
