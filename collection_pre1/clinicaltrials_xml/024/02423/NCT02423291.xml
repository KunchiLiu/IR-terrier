	<brief_summary>Study Objectives Primary : • To determine antitumor efficacy single-agent Brentuximab vedotin ( 1.8 mg/kg administer intravenously every 3 week ) measure overall objective response rate patient relapse refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma . Secondary : - To assess duration tumor control , include duration response progression-free survival - To assess survival - To assess safety tolerability Brentuximab vedotin Additional : • To assess disease-related symptom Number Planned Patients 20 patient enrol study . Duration study The study duration 18 month enrollment 2 year follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study SGN-35 ( Brentuximab Vedotin ) Patients With Relapsed Refractory PMLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population Eligible patient relapse refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma . Patients must also histologically-confirmed CD30-positive disease , fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -avid measurable disease least 1.5 cm , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 , adequate hematologic , kidney , liver function . Eligible patient must previously treat Brentuximab vedotin previously receive allotransplant . In addition , patient must congestive heart failure , know cerebral/meningeal disease , active viral , bacterial , fungal infection require treatment antimicrobial therapy within 2 week prior first study dose . Study Design This single-arm , open-label , multicenter , clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety Brentuximab vedotin single agent patient relapse refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma . Brentuximab vedotin administer single IV infusion Day 1 21-day cycle . Measures anti-cancer activity assess use revise response criterion malignant lymphoma . CT scan ( chest , neck , abdomen , pelvis ) perform baseline Cycles 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 PET scan do baseline Cycles 4 7 . Patients EOT assessment 30 ± 7 day receive final dose study drug . Long-term follow-up assessment ( include survival disease status information ) perform every 12 week either patient death study closure , whichever occur first . Patients discontinue study treatment stable disease well CT scan do every 12 week disease progression . Test Product , Dose , Mode Administration Brentuximab vedotin , 1.8 mg/kg , administer via outpatient IV infusion Day 1 21-day cycle . Number Planned Patients 20 patient enrol study . Duration Treatment Brentuximab vedotin administer single IV infusion Day 1 21-day cycle . Patients may continue study treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease well receive minimum 8 , 16 cycle study treatment . Duration study The study duration 18 month enrollment 2 year follow-up . Efficacy Assessments Treatment response assess tumor imaging ( spiral CT neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis PET scan ) perform protocol-specified timepoints . Determination antitumor efficacy base objective response assessment make accord Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma . Clinical response progressive disease ( PD ) , stable disease ( SD ) , partial remission ( PR ) , complete remission ( CR ) determine assessment . Responses determine investigator . Safety Assessments Assessment safety course study consist surveillance record adverse event ( AEs ) , record concomitant medication measurement protocol-specified physical examination finding laboratory test .</detailed_description>
