	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) provide high resolution information regard anatomic structure tissue eye cross-sectional 3 dimensional view . Much information able visualized clinician . Utilizing information surgery allow ophthalmic surgeon well understand surgical procedure impact anatomic structure eye . In study OCT device build microscope ( rather mount side hold surgeon 's hand ) utilize take image various milestone surgery ass feasibility potential utility technology . Since build microscope , potential significant advantage separate system include increased efficiency , improve work distance , ability visualize tissue-instrument interaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) become critical component evaluation ophthalmic disease . Similar ultrasound , OCT use light reconstruct image tissue interest . In effect , OCT function almost like light biopsy , allow clinician visualize subtle change tissue , macular edema subretinal fluid . OCT clinic set become gold standard monitoring disease macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy ; become one frequently order diagnostic test ophthalmology . Due restraint size structure image equipment , use OCT operating room limit . More recently , modification OCT table-tops model well development hand-held OCT probe allow translation OCT technology operate room . The high resolution anatomic information gain OCT image natural complement ophthalmic surgeon . Using OCT vitreoretinal surgery reveal subtle change microarchitecture retinal disease retinal detachment , macular hole optic pit , previously know . Our research team examine intraoperative OCT operating room use handheld microscope-mounted portable spectral domain OCT probe excellent success outstanding safety record . In study OCT device build microscope ( rather mount side hold surgeon 's hand ) utilize take image various milestone surgery ass feasibility potential utility technology . Since build microscope , potential significant advantage separate system include increased efficiency , improve work distance , ability visualize tissue-instrument interaction .</detailed_description>
