	<detailed_description>Muscle cramp common patient liver disease associate significantly diminish quality life . Patients cirrhosis often experience muscle cramp vary frequency severity . The exact mechanism occur remain unclear , although number pathophysiological event unique liver disease may contribute . Clinical study identify alteration 3 area : nerve function , energy metabolism , plasma volume/electrolytes [ 1 ] . Although number mechanism cramp liver disease postulate targeted medical therapy , clear picture causal event emerge . Several agent vitamin E , human albumin , zinc , taurine , eperisone hydrochloride branched-chain amino acid show benefit small uncontrolled study , although large randomize controlled trial lack [ 2 ] . Orphenadrine anticholinergic drug prominent central nervous system ( CNS ) peripheral action use treat painful muscle spasm similar condition . The combination anticholinergic effect CNS penetration make orphenadrine useful pain etiology , include : radiculopathy , muscle , headache . [ 3,4 ] Orphenadrine structurally related diphenhydramine carry relatively strong anticholinergic weak sedative property , It mostly excrete kidney . [ 5 ]</detailed_description>
