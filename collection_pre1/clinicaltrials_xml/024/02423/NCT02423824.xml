	<brief_summary>Cognitive deficit core feature across disparate brain disorder , highly prevalent pervasive . Impairments executive function one consistent finding clinical meta-analytical study report principal mediator psychosocial impairment disability . Cognitive dysfunction think underlied abnormality distribute brain circuit , cellular molecular level . Nonetheless , neural mechanism underlie dysregulation circuit poorly understood . Emerging evidence indicate metabolic abnormality highly relevant domain cognitive function indicate alteration metabolic pathway may relevant neurocognitive decline across different population . The incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) hormone secrete intestinal epithelial cell . GLP-1 receptor widely express central nervous system . Pre-clinical trial demonstrate significant neuroprotective effect GLP-1 . Ongoing clinical trial measure cognition mood population various psychiatric disorder lend impetus explore effect GLP-1R agonist brain structure cognitive function . We hypothesize GLP-1 GLP-1R relevant molecular cellular process think underlie formation maintenance brain circuit . A derivative hypothesis administration GLP-1 agonist may result enhanced neuronal survival consequential increase gray matter volume . We therefore propose explore cellular molecular abnormality within neural circuit subserve cognition use GLP-1R agonist liraglutide . The overall goal study explore relationship metabolic molecular target ( i.e . GLP1 system ) , neural circuit interest behavioral phenotype cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose explore effect GLP-1 agonism brain structure function . We hypothesize administration GLP-1 agonist may result increased connectivity executive control network . Multiple clinical trial pharmacological agent , well cognitive therapy , report measurement brain structure function correlate cognitive performance , indicate valid biological correlate cognitive function . To assess hypothesis recruit clinical population , represent individual measurable impairment executive function , wherein target propose intervention show altered . We currently position sufficiently homogenize subgroup adult mood disorder basis single combinatorial biomarkers . It also unlikely alteration GLP-1 receptor function , propose model herein , sufficiently explanatory sub-populations adult mood disorder . Instead , propose adult mood disorder , co-existing metabolic disorder ( e.g . type 2 diabetes mellitus ) , would likely brain illness influence ( i.e . cause , consequence ) alteration cellular bioenergetics . Moreover , convergent evidence suggest GLP-1 receptor function may , least partially , dependent glucose level and/or insulin sensibility . It separate , yet testable , hypothesis subpopulation enrich basis metabolic comorbidity ( i.e . insulin resistance ) may responsive intervention target metabolic pathway . We plan test effect adjunctive liraglutide executive function . We select subpopulation patient , mood disorder impairment executive function , define below-average ( i.e . 1 standard deviation norm ) performance Trail Making Test-B ( TMTB ) . Furthermore , plan recruit two group patient , without insulin resistance , define homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) 2.5 , allow comparison effect liraglutide metabolically heterogeneous population .</detailed_description>
