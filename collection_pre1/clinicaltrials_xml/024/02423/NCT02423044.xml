	<brief_summary>Background : - Fear normal response threat . Learning fear helpful sometimes . For people anxiety disorder , fear long-lasting intense . Researchers want study people become fearful situation . They want understand brain learns helpful feel fear . Objective : - To good understand brain process related fear anxiety . Eligibility : - Right-handed adult age 18 50 generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder , social anxiety disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder . - Right hand volunteer age 18-50 without psychiatric disorder . - And free psychiatric medication 2 week Design : - Participants first screen another protocol . - Participants play video game inside magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner . The scanner metal cylinder It surround strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide scanner . A device call coil place head . - During scan , participant may play virtual reality video game . Game instruction explain enter scanner . - While play game , participant wear 2 electrode finger . These measure sweat skin . They also 2 small electrode attach left hand . These give brief mild electrical shock . - Participants ask question play game scan . - Before scan , participant fill questionnaire emotion . They may complete questionnaire online clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To examine process involve distinguish threaten safe condition , aim investigate neural base contextual fear learn use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . To , study behavioral , physiological , brain response aversive stimulus encounter virtual environment , explore fear-related response depend surround environment . In addition , examine response differ clinical anxiety . We interested study Pavlovian aversive context conditioning healthy control patient anxiety disorder . We examine extent participant learn discriminate dangerous safe virtual context , learn map neural network underlie anxiety context coding . We expect successful learn contextual fear response healthy control , evidence differential skin conductance response neural activation safe vs. threat context . Accordingly , anticipate high neuronal activity hippocampus , prefrontal cortex , amygdala . These finding accompany increase hippocampus-prefrontal cortex connectivity approach exploration dangerous context , increase amygdala activation anticipation shock dangerous context . Physiologically , SCR increase threat context compare safe context . However , anxious patient expect fail learn differentiate safe threat context , exhibit increase SCR neural activation safe threat context , index contextual generalization fear . Particularly , lack contextual fear discrimination anxious patient associate weak hippocampal activation contextual learning . To examine differential context fear conditioning , use virtual reality ( VR ) paradigm . VR provide optimal way probe spatial navigation simulates context . The VR task present outdoor space , comprise dangerous ( probabilistic electrical shock ) safe ( shock ) location . Healthy control patient anxiety disorder compare physiological neural reactivity task performance . Preliminary psychophysiological data suggest propose procedure effective way promote different response safe dangerous spatial location . Hence , anticipate procedure allow u examine brain correlate differential contextual fear response human compare healthy participant patient diagnose anxiety disorder . Study population : Two study population , healthy volunteer patient diagnose anxiety disorder ( generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , panic disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder ) complete protocol . Participants adult male female , age 18 50 year . Design : This fMRI study compare performance , physiological neural measure healthy adult patient anxiety disorder , perform threat VR task scanner . The VR task entail navigate virtual outdoor environment , , unbeknownst participant divide safe dangerous context , recognizable environmental characteristic ( e.g. , mountain , cloud ) . The dangerous context associate probabilistic shock , never encounter safe context . Participants learn two context collect flower ( cue ) , one time , either context . In dangerous context , flower associate 50 % chance shock Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure cerebral fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) responses three event : ( 1 ) shock anticipation : collecting cue ( flower ) anticipation potential shock , ( 2 ) context exploration : participant navigate threat context safe context trial ( start flower appear environment ) , ( 3 ) cue approach : approach towards flower , threat safe context . The secondary outcome measure consist change psychophysiological response , SCR , heart rate , pupil dilatation , respiratory rate , validate fear response .</detailed_description>
