	<brief_summary>Background : - Medical problem treatment cause stress people . Researchers want learn measure distress young people medical illness . A screening tool call Checking In developed order help researcher find way identify concern stress common group . Objective : - To create screen tool help health care provider identify psychological social distress young people serious illness . Eligibility : - Outpatient youth age 8 21 enrol research protocol NIH time study . Design : - Phase 1 participant complete paper-and-pencil version Checking In . It ask mood , pain , fatigue , peer relationship , sleep . During phase , participant ask word question Checking In . They also talk thought question understood . - Phase 2 involve participant enrollment . During phase researcher work technologist develop software electronic version Checking In . - Phase 3 participant complete electronic version Checking In . Researchers ask question ease difficulty use electronic screen . - Phase 4 participant one caregiver complete electronic version Checking In . They also complete questionnaire relate mood , pain fatigue , peer relationship sleep . They ask thought use Checking In . On day , NIH doctor get summary data questionnaire answer . The doctor also provide feedback summary form . - Researchers compare data Checking In data questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Checking Out Checking In : The Development Validation Electronic Screening Tool Pediatric Psychosocial Distress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study develop implement Checking In , brief interactive screening measure distress , design identify emotional , physical , social , practical spiritual concern pediatric patient .

Objective 1 : The primary objective protocol develop brief electronic screening tool , Checking In , would assist clinician assess presence psychological distress child adolescent cancer serious medical illness . The electronic scale , develop , meet NIH requirement gather store electronic data . In order accomplish aim , researcher conduct cognitive interview 60 pediatric patient order refine question phrase item Checking In . The result phase study use develop electronic screen , use accomplish remain aim . Objective 2 : To assess concurrent validity ( i.e . extent test correlate previously validate measure similar construct ) Checking In compare validated measure psychological symptom ( i.e . depression , anxiety , pain fatigue ) patient pediatric cancer , Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) Primary Immune Deficiencies ( PIDs ) . Objective 3 : To assess feasibility administer Checking In pediatric patient caregiver . Researchers administer Checking In complete brief questionnaire rating feasibility administration barrier encounter . These find help guide refinement electronic screen tool . Objective 4 : To evaluate usefulness Checking In summary report . Providers complete survey evaluate usefulness summary report indicate whether : 1 ) report provide useful information , 2 ) information present user-friendly manner , 3 ) summary report impact care plan child . Objective 5 : Another objective study assess acceptability complete Checking In screen tool among patient cancer serious illness primary caregiver . This aim achieve patient caregiver answer brief questionnaire ass acceptable find Checking In complete . Secondary Objective 1 : To assess burden benefit complete Checking In . Secondary Objective 2 : To assess inter-rater reliability Checking In compare rating patient distress give patient primary caregiver . -Study Population : This study take place National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . All outpatient , age 8-21 , enrol research study either Pediatric Clinic Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic NIH diagnosis pediatric cancer , NF-1 PIDs invite participate study . -Design : The initial phase study consist researcher conduct cognitive interview 60 patient order refine question phrase item Checking In . Preliminary question Checking In derive modified PI previous protocol Distress Thermometer . During first phase , paper pencil version Checking In use . Results initial phase use phase 2 develop electronic version Checking In . A bid conduct NIH hire technology development group build Checking In application . This include interface development , graphic , ability application generate printout summary report . De-identified data phase 1 physician survey utilize guide application development . During phase 3 , electronic version Checking In pilot test . Twenty-five patient enrol phase . Patients give tablet ask complete Checking In . A researcher present ensure application run smoothly interface feasible . Once electronic version Checking In finalize , researcher begin phase 4 study . During phase 4 , patient complete brief electronic self-report distress scale , Checking In , standardized measure depression , anxiety , pain , fatigue . Additionally , participant ask assess benefit burden Checking In . Primary caregiver rate child level distress use Checking In , well complete measure assess child pain , fatigue , anxiety , depression . Caregivers also ask question assess benefit burden Checking In . Both patient primary caregiver assess acceptability complete Checking In . Medical provider rate usefulness Checking In summary report , well provide performance rating patient use Lansky/Karnofsky Performance status score . Additionally , data collector assess feasibility administer Checking In pediatric outpatient clinic . -Outcome Measures Measures include Checking In ; PROMIS measure Anxiety , Depression , Fatigue , Pain Intensity , Pain Interference , Sleep Disturbance Peer Relationships ; Acceptability Feasibility scale completion Checking In ; Benefit Burden Scale .</detailed_description>
