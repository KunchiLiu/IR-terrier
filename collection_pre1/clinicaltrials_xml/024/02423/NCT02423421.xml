	<brief_title>Faecal Microbiota Transplantation Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) chronic , debilitate , functional gastrointestinal disorder estimate population prevalence Europe 10 -15 % ( Ford et al ) . These symptom debilitate lead significant reduction quality life particularly severely affected . Alterations function composition gut microbiota increasingly implicate potential aetiological factor . ( Collins et al ) . One strong indictors concept significantly increase risk develop IBS episode acute gastroenteritis . Prospective study demonstrate 3- 36 % enteric infection lead new , persistent IBS symptom . ( Gwee al. , Neal et al ) A number study demonstrate diversity , stability metabolic activity gut microbiota alter IBS patient compare healthy individual ( Jeffrey et al ) . Although distinct microbial signature identify IBS , several study show gut microbial composition enrich Firmicutes together reduce abundance Bacteroides ( Jeffery et al , Rajilic-Stojanovic et al ) . Faecal microbial transplantation ( FMT ) proven safe , inexpensive effective treatment recurrent Clostridium difficile infection achieve 90 % cure rate study good side effect adverse event profile ( van . Nood et al. ) . In study investigator wish investigate whether restore healthy gut microbiota profile , use stool healthy donor , lead improve clinical outcome patient IBS . Autologous fecal microbiota transplant use - infusion participant faeces previously use placebo study use FMT ( Vrieze et al ) 2 . Study Design The design study prospective randomise , placebo control study carry single site . The study involve four visit total 8 week period . The first visit screen visit ass eligibility study . Visit two treatment visit patient receive FMT use stool healthy donor placebo . An autologous faecal microbiota transplant use placebo study . Follow visit perform 4 week 8 week treatment . Up 50 patient IBS recruit study . All patient establish diagnosis IBS per Rome III criterion . Subjects recruit population IBS patient attend Cork gastroenterology outpatient . Subjects randomly assign either treatment group placebo control group . 3 . Donor Selection : Donor stool obtain healthy donor . The donor interview ensure good health undergo screen questionnaire identify potential infectious risk could transfer stool . Certain exclusion criterion apply donor undergo test stool serum . The donation process safe donor ( Bakken et al ) . A select healthy individual diverse microbial composition preferentially use donor candidate unless recipient wish dictate use designate donor . 3.1 Donor Exclusion criterion Risk infectious agent Known Human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis B C. Known exposure HIV viral hepatitis Known current communicable disease High risk lifestyle factor Factors increase risk Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Gastrointestinal co-morbidities History inflammatory bowel disease History IBS History gastrointestinal malignancy polyposis History major Gastrointestinal surgery Factors affect composition intestinal microbiota . Antibiotics within precede 3 month Major immunosuppressive medication Systemic anti-neoplastic drug Additional recipient specific consideration Recent ingestion potential allergen recipient know allergy . Systemic autoimmunity Atopic diseases Chronic pain syndrome Obesity . 3.2 Donor Testing The following screening test perform potential donor : Stool test Clostridium difficile polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) PCR Shigella , Salmonella , E.coli verotoxin , Campylobacter Cryptosporidium Ova parasites Serological test HIV , type 1 2 Hepatitis A IgM Hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody hepatitis B surface antibody . Hepatitis C screen human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV ) Rapid Plasma Reagin fluorescent treponemal antibody absorb . 4 . FMT procedure protocol : The following procedure follow term donor recipient preparation preparation administration donor stool . 1 . Donor Preparation Can use gentle osmotic laxative night procedure . Provide stool sample morning procedure . 2 . Recipient Preparation Standard pre colonoscopy bowel preparation day FMT . 3 . Stool preparation After passage stool donor immediately transfer anaerobic hood process . The stool dilute filtered produce liquid slurry consistency The liquid stool place anaerobic bottle transfer site administration . 4 . Stool administration . The stool administer soon possible 's prepared , maximum 2 hour . The FMT perform endoscopically . All patient undergo colonoscopy liquid stool infuse endoscope . Ideally patient also duodenal infusion stool perform via oesphogastrodoudenoscopy session . However patient consent deem protocol breach . 5 . Study Procedures : The study conduct outline protocol accordance ICH Guidelines Good Clinical Practice , declaration Helsinki [ Appendix A ] . Informed consent obtain prior study related procedure undertake . 5.1.1 Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) The aim study procedure undertake explain potential subject . Subjects request read subject information sheet read sign inform consent form , receive sign copy . The following assessment perform Visit 1 Informed consent Demographics Medical medication history Rome III questionnaire Evaluation eligibility criterion Vital sign Physical examination , body weight , height BMI assessment Food frequency questionnaire IBS symptom assessment score Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale International Physical activity Index Blood sample Stool sample If patient meet eligibility criterion return within 28 day undergo faecal microbiota transplantation . 5.1.2 Treatment Visit ( Visit 2 ) At visit 2 patient undergo faecal microbial transplantation . Prior procedure patient undergo standard bowel preparation . At Visit 2 follow assessment perform patient FMT perform Brief interview previous week Vital sign physical examination . Eligibility assessment Informed consent endoscopy . The donor stool administer patient endoscopically . All patient undergo colonoscopy donor stool infuse colonoscope . Decision perform duodenal infusion well colonic infusion dictate patient preference . If patient consent also undergo oesphogastrodoudenoscopy donor stool infuse gastroscope patient duodenum . Following procedure patent manage recovery per standard endoscopy guideline . 5.1.3 Visit 3 4 - Follow visit . At visit 3 4 patient undergo follow Interview previous week . Vital sign physical exam incl BMI Concomitant medication Adverse event monitor Blood sample clinical research . Stool sample ( collect home prior visit ) . Food frequency questionnaire IBS symptom assessment score Global assessment question . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale International Physical activity Index 5.2 Removal subject study Subjects withdrawn study subject ; Elects independently withdraw study ; If he/she develop condition contravenes original criterion ; Is consider point unsuitable continue study , discretion investigator . 5.3 Concomitant Medication Subjects question medication history . The detail medication take recorded patient case note case report form 5.4 Endpoint assessment Subjects follow endpoint assessment perform : assessment medical surgical history change since baseline/treatment visit , IBS severity/QOL score , faecal sample assessment/analysis , blood sample analysis , physical assessment , concomitant medication adverse event . To ensure subject safety follow evaluation perform study : vital sign , adverse event monitoring , physical examination laboratory assessment 6 . Biological Sample Collections Analysis : 6.1 Blood Blood collect visit clinical haematological biochemical analysis cytokine analysis . Haematology biochemistry panel do per standard care - Full blood count ( include haemoglobin , white cell count , platelet count , haematocrit differential white cell count ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , sodium , potassium , chloride , urea , creatinine , protein , albumin , crp , liver function test quantitative immunoglobulin ( IgA , Immunoglobulin G , IgM ) . Participants also HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HTLV syphilis screen perform visit 1 . This analysis perform Cork University Hospital ( CUH ) laboratory . All laboratory result review report sign investigator record patient case repot form ( CRF ) . Research blood serum analysis inflammatory immune marker include cytokine perform , theses blood process laboratory Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre , University College Cork ( UCC ) . 6.2 Faecal Sample Faecal sample collect visit .
