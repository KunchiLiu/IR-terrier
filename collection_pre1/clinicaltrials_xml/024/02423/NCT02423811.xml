	<brief_summary>Esophageal cancer common fatal malignancy . It eighth common incident cancer sixth lead cause cancer death world . In Taiwan , esophageal cancer newly diagnose 2199 patient cause 1507 deaths 2011 . Squamous cell carcinoma predominant histological tumor type , account 90 % case . Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) aggressive disease , characterize extensive local growth frequent metastasis . Concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) without surgery treatment option locally advance ESCC . Further , target therapy use conjunction CCRT surgery ESCC since several year ago . However , therapeutic outcome satisfactory due emergence chemo-radioresistance . It imperative investigate new biomarkers find novel treatment target ESCC . A small population tumor-initiating cell cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) posse biological function like normal stem cell , include self-renewal , asymmetric cell division , slowly proliferation rate drug-resistance . CSCs many primary tumor cell line express specific stem cell marker , include Oct4 , Sox2 , Nanog , CD133 ( promimin-1 ) , Nestin , CD44 , CD24 , ALDH ( Aldehyde dehydrogenase ) c-Kit . There many evidence CSCs responsible tumor initiation , progression metastasis . CSCs also believe important role cancer recurrence due resistance anti-cancer drug radiation . CSCs express high level ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter . ABC transporter pump cytotoxic drug cell one important mechanism multidrug resistance CSCs . In addition , CSCs high reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) scavenger expression remove ROS produced irradiation therapy . Fursultiamine ( also know thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide , TTFD ) derivative vitamin B currently use nutrition supplement . The investigator identify Fursultiamine suppress OCT-4 , SOX-2 , NANOG expression decrease ABCB1 ABCG2 tumor sphere ESCC cell line . In project , investigator conduct prospective phase II study investigate effect Fursultiamine combine CCRT ESCC patient . Stem cell marker clinical specimen collect CCRT evaluate .</brief_summary>
