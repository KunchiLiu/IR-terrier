	<brief_summary>This research study study new image method show lymph node lung lung cancer surgery . The name study intervention involve study : -- The combination FluoSCOPE device Indocyanine Green</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Novel Fluorescence Endoscopic Device Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Indocyanine Green specific disease , approve us . In research study , investigator interest learn new investigational device , FluoSCOPE , perform operate room . This study also allow investigator optimize setting image system . The investigator hope device , along local injection Indocyanine Green around tumor , help find sentinel lymph node real-time surgery remove lung cancer . Although first time FluoSCOPE use human , technology near-infrared fluorescence imaging use detection sentinel lymph node patient breast cancer , skin cancer lung cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participant must histologically confirm lung cancer deem appropriate surgical candidate thoracoscopic lung resection consent sentinel lymph node map oncologic surgeon . These patient invasive nonsmall cell lung cancer thoracoscopic mediastinal lymph node dissection time thoracoscopic lung resection standard care . The extent lung resection potential trial patient could span sublobar resection ( i.e . wedge resection ) pneumonectomy , though anticipated patient undergoing common anatomic operation lung cancer lobectomy . All stage lung cancer would otherwise undergoing thoracoscopic lung resection mediastinal lymph node dissection would eligible . Age minimum : 18 year . The minimum eligible subject age trial 18 year . Individuals old age 18 typically cared adult oncology clinic institution . Individuals age 18 exclude safety study include dose adverse event data population currently available . Essentially patient operate upon lung cancer BIDMC adult men woman . Because nature disease , anticipate , , enrol child study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition indocyanine green , include patient history iodide seafood allergy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Women pregnant may become pregnant , well woman breastfeed , exclude study . Pregnant woman exclude study unknown risk associate ICG ( US FDA Risk Category C : control study woman , study available either animal woman ) . Because unknown , potential , risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . Patients tumor might accessible peritumoral injection indocyanine green , e.g . small , central tumor . No appropriate agentspecific exclusion criterion .</criteria>
