	<brief_summary>Background : - Genes make DNA instruction book cell . When people cancer , gene might slow growth tumor cell turn . Researchers think drug call TdCyd might help turn gene back . This may slow growth tumor people cancer . Objectives : - To test safety TdCyd find work . Also , find dose drug safely give human . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old advance cancer progress standard treatment , effective therapy exists . Design : - Participants take TdCyd mouth . The drug give 21-day cycle . TdCyd take day week 1 5 day . Then 2 day participant take drug . Then take 5 day week 2 . No TdCyd take week 3 . - Participants keep diary study drug dos . - Participants test every 3 week see study drug affect body . They blood urine test , medical history , physical exam . They may compute tomography ( CT ) scan measure tumor . They may electrocardiogram , measure heart electrical activity . - If participant develop side effect , may ask visit often . - Participants stay study long tolerate TdCyd tumor either stable get good . One month stop drug , follow-up phone call .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial 4'-Thio-2'-Deoxycytidine ( TdCyd ) Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Methylation-mediated silencing gene epigenetic mechanism implicate carcinogenesis ; agent inhibit mechanism clinical interest potential re-activate silence tumor suppressor gene . Two DNA hypomethylating nucleoside , 5-azacytidine ( azacytidine ) 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( decitabine ) approve FDA treatment patient myelodysplastic syndrome certain leukemia . - The nucleoside analog 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine ( TdCyd ) incorporate DNA engages active site DNA methyltransferase I ( DNMT1 ) , maintenance methyltransferase contribute hypermethylation silence tumor suppressor gene . DNMT1 become trap covalent complex DNA , thus deplete free enzyme inhibit normal maintenance methylation CpG sit , result reactivation tumor suppressor gene . - Data generate Southern Research Institute NCI suggest correlation TdCyd activity solid tumor xenograft model decrease level DNMT1 . - TdCyd offer improvement current DNA methyltransferase inhibitor virtue high incorporation rate DNA low level cytotoxicity ; treatment TdCyd anticipate result inhibition tumor growth due DNMT1 depletion oral dos well tolerate extend dose schedule . - Two patient dose level 6 7 develop Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PJP ) patient administer PJP prophylaxis . Primary Objective : -To establish safety , tolerability , MTD oral TdCyd administer daily 5 day week 2 week , one week , q 21-day cycle , patient refractory solid tumor Secondary Objectives : - To determine pharmacokinetics oral TdCyd - To document preliminary evidence TdCyd activity - To determine effect study treatment re-expression select gene silence methylation circulate tumor cell Eligibility : -Patients must histologically document solid tumor whose disease progress standard therapy available standard therapy Study Design : - TdCyd administer orally day 5 day week 2 week , one week , 21-day cycle . - The trial follow accelerate titration design , change traditional 3+3 dose escalation design ( 3-6 patient per cohort ) specify toxicity criterion meet . Intrapatient dose escalation allow . - Blood sample obtain pharmacokinetic analysis isolate circulate tumor cell assess re-expression gene silence methylation .</detailed_description>
