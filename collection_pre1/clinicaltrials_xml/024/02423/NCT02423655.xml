	<brief_title>Routine Deferred Dialysis Initiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The timing initiate dialysis progressive chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient important issue yet well establish . There strong trend early dialysis initiation end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient past decade . However , observational data find early initiation seem produce benefit additional burden patient health care system . The IDEAL study , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) issue , find all-cause mortality , comorbidities quality life difference early ( glomerular filtration rate , GFR 10-14ml/min/1.73m2 ) late ( GFR 5-7ml/min/1.73m2 ) dialysis starter . However big limitation study difference average GFR two group ( 12 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 9.8 ml/min/1.73m2 ) separate . Recently , Canadian Society Nephrology release clinical practice guideline issue . The guideline recommend `` intent-to-defer '' approach dialysis initiation initiate dialysis absence symptom patient estimate GFR 6 ml/min /1.73 m2 le . In guideline specialist also express optimal management patient estimate GFR 6 ml/min per 1.73 m2 less base limited data . There gap knowledge . This research evaluate efficacy safety defer dialysis initiation fill gap . In study , algorithms adopt determine time dialysis initiation routine defer dialiysis group , difference two algorithms GFR level initiate dialysis ( 7 Vs. &lt; 5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 ) . The theory blood access ( arteriovenous fistula ) timely prepared accord past GFR decline trajectory also test .</detailed_description>
