	<brief_title>Yoga During Chemotherapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance among common symptom experienced cancer patient , occur 80 % patient chemotherapy , result serious impairment quality life . Although pharmacologic therapy improve sleep disturbance , numerous side effect , problem tolerance dependence , well studied oncology patient . While non-pharmacologic therapy may decrease sleep disturbance , current level evidence efficacy insufficient . Fatigue occur 95 % receive chemotherapy , result major impairment function quality life . Despite significance , effective treatment currently exist fatigue . Prior study suggest yoga may helpful sleep disturbance fatigue , study limitation . An important challenge yoga research typically multi-modality practice include physical posture , breathe practice , and/or meditation component . Prior study adequately address effect individual component . Therefore , key question remain unanswered effective element yoga ; best combine particular problem chemotherapy symptom ; optimal dosing . The current study address gap literature perform key developmental step prepare large randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . It build preliminary work yoga breathe practice chemotherapy find improve sleep disturbance , show trend toward improvement fatigue , feasible implement patient undergoing chemotherapy . Using mixed-methods approach evaluate intervention component , investigator pursue three closely interlinked step cancer patient receive chemotherapy . In Aim 1 ( n=10 ) , investigator manualize individualized approach yoga breathe intervention iteratively refine insure feasibility acceptability . In Aim 2 ( n=20 ) , investigator manualize yoga posture intervention , evaluate restorative/static pose flow pose , perform iterative refinement test feasibility acceptability . In Aim 3 ( n=70 ) , investigator assess final multi-modality yoga intervention select final intervention element delivery method test planned future RCT . This proposal help improve treatment debilitate cancer associate symptom advance approach develop therapeutic yoga intervention trial .</detailed_description>
