	<brief_summary>Currently , UVA , handheld ultrasound device ( like use view unborn baby ) two dimensional . The Accuro three dimensional handheld ultrasound device . This device use sound wave create picture spine three dimension . This may allow physician view spine detail procedure spinal anesthesia diagnostic procedure . Epidural analgesia mainstay procedure management labor pain . The precise placement needle catheter proximity landmarks spinal bone anatomy required procedure succeed . The current standard care call 'blind approach ' ( i.e . without medical imaging ) involve physician manually palpate patient 's back locate spinal bone landmark . The needle inserted respect location landmark insert loss-of-resistance manually detect . This approach , common , associated success rate low 68 % obese patient ( 2 ) . Alternative method investigate problem , include ultrasound ( US ) guidance , offer real-time imaging . Several study demonstrate ultrasound 's efficacy spinal anesthesia ( 1-6 ) . However , standard US system engineer image soft tissue rather bone structure , consequence bone image poorly . US image often degrade number noise source include speckle noise , reverberation off-axis scattering , particularly bone present , make visualization bone anatomy feature difficult . Moreover , arrange access ultrasound purpose spinal anesthesia alone cumbersome . Thus , efficacy guide spinal anesthesia diagnostic procedure use standard ultrasound system limit benefit offer heavily dependent user 's familiarity skill ultrasonography ( 4 ) . Recently , new medical imaging technology develop Rivanna Medical , LLC address significant clinical need technological advance improve placement spinal anesthesia , epidural analgesia diagnostic procedure . The Accuro pocket-sized battery operate ultrasound instrument incorporate new signal processing-based technology enhance bone image include 3D navigation lumbar spine . The device single self-contained unit consist ultrasound system , ultrasound probe , rotatable touchscreen display . The instrument enable SpineView3D™ technology facilitate spinal anesthesia guidance real-time 3D navigation lumbar spine anatomy . SpineView3D™ technology facilitate image interpretation individual 2D lumbar spine scan automate spinal bone landmark detection depth measurement provide real-time assessment scan plane orientation 3D . SpineView3D™ make image interpretation measurement lumbar spine anatomy simple , quick , easy . Real-time 2D scan either SpineView3D™ general-purpose bone presets form use patent-pending BoneEnhance+™ technology . The BoneEnhance+™ technology provide image bone anatomy great bone-to-tissue contrast compare conventional ultrasound image reconstruction .</brief_summary>
