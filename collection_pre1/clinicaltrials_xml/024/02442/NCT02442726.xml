	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The conduction speed peripheral nerve fiber depend nerve diameter . The conduction velocity large myelinated fiber 50 - 120 m/s , small myelinated A-delta- unmyelinated C-fibers , range 5-10 m/s , 0.5-1 m/s , respectively . Applying short laser pulse high energy density synchronization , simple reaction time use determine type fiber class activate . Research group Plaghki colleague show stimulate surface area 15 50 sq.mm supra-threshold intensity activate A-delta-fibers , typical bimodal response pattern observe first peak center around 400 ms second around 850 m . Whereas early peak due activation A-delta-fibers , second peak cause C-fiber activation . HYPOTHESIS Following mild thermal skin injury ( 47ÂºC , 420 , 9.0 12.5 sq.cm area ) injure area associate erythema increase sensitivity , i.e . pain easily evoked mechanical thermal stimulus primary hyperalgesia area . In normal skin surround injury mechanical thermal allodynia hyperalgesia , present . Innocuous stimuli secondary hyperalgesia area may elicit pain . This believed central process suggest pioneer research 1980s 1990s . The term phenomenon heterosynaptic central facilitation mean innocuous stimulus may activate normally high-threshold nociceptive dorsal horn neuron lead allodynia . This conversion innocuous stimulus normal skin outside injury , pain generate stimulus , result change sensory processing within CNS . This processing probably regulate spino-bulbo-spinal loop include rostral ventro-medial medulla ( RVM ) locus coeruleus ( LC ) . The study hypothesis , first , reaction time thermal injury site ( i.e . primary hyperalgesia area ) change compare pre-injury level . Second , sensory change secondary hyperalgesia area , follow thermal injury , exclusively centrally mediate , also change peripheral afferent , e.g . A-delta-fibers ( AMH type I ) demonstrable assessment reaction time CO2 laser pulse . A well-known alternative laser stimulation use contact thermode much large stimulation area , i.e . 2.5 16 sq.cm . The substantially large area contact thermode , combine slow heat rate , compare laser stimulus ( &lt; 0.5 sq.cm , 10 m ) , may induce pronounced spatial temporal summation , interfere accurate interpretation sensory data . A recent method-comparison study patient postherpetic neuralgia , compare assessment obtain contact thermode ( 9 sq.cm ) laser stimulus ( &lt; 0.25 sq.mm ) , indicate laser method sensitive specific detect thermal sensory abnormality . Since laser stimulus give steep slope heat profile synchronize activation warmth- heat-sensitive small fiber , i.e . C- A-delta-fibers , skin laser stimulation prefer method present study . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS The propensity develop secondary hyperalgesia may reflect predisposition develop persistent postsurgical pain . It estimate 2-10 % patient undergoing otherwise uncomplicated surgical procedure suffer persistent postsurgical pain . Investigating pathophysiological mechanism behind secondary hyperalgesia may therefore increase understand transition chronic pain thereby improve management strategy large patient group .</detailed_description>
