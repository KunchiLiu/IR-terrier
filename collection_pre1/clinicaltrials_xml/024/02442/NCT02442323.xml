	<brief_summary>Despite evidence regard benefit physical activity various cancer patient population , effect home-based walk program pancreatic cancer patient under-explored . The aim propose pilot project : ( 1 ) Assess feasibility implement 12-week , home-based walk program among pancreatic cancer patient ; ( 2 ) Examine effect 12-week , home-based walk program quality life ( QOL ) symptoms among pancreatic cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Home-Based Walking Intervention Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among cancer patient , physical activity intervention lead improvement QOL reduction fatigue pain . While pancreatic cancer patient may physical restriction limit participation moderate high-intensity exercise activity , empirical evidence suggest even low-intensity , home-based walking program confer benefit cancer patient . In pilot study , 50 patient randomly assign receive either walking intervention program usual care ( UC ) . Assessments quality life , distress , symptom burden complete baseline ( pre-intervention ) follow-up ( i.e . within 2 week post-intervention approximately 12-14 week post-baseline ) . Data propose pilot study inform development large randomize trial design improve QOL reduce morbidity patient population .</detailed_description>
