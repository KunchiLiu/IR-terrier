	<detailed_description>Resistance train show promise among intervention aim combat age muscle atrophy enhances strength , power , mobility function , induces vary degree skeletal muscle hypertrophy demonstrate initial 5-year funding period award ( 2001-2006 ) . In subsequent 5-year funding period ( 2007-2012 ) , build prior work use dose-response approach old adult - ultimately optimize treatment age-related muscle atrophy . We test four , long-term resistance training prescription older ( 60-75 yr ) woman men determine prescription maximizes mechanisms drive muscle regrowth ( protein synthesis myonuclear addition ) . One innovation project use 4-wk pre-training program reach plateau early , non-muscle mass adaptation , thereby establish true baseline mechanism measurable muscle hypertrophy functional consequence hypertrophy could study tightly integrated fashion without bias subsequent experimental period . A randomized design use test overarch hypothesis novel program mixed strength power training would optimize anabolic environment promote muscle hypertrophy robust gain performance . This hypothesis test three specific aim . Specific Aim 1 . We determine effect manipulate intensity , recovery , mode contraction rate muscle hypertrophy muscle mass-dependent improvement test vivo muscle performance among old woman men . In brief , four training model : ( 1 ) traditional high-resistance concentric-eccentric training ( H ) 3 d/wk ( HHH3 ) ; ( 2 ) high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk ( HH2 ) ; ( 3 ) 3 d/wk mixed model consist high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk separate 1 bout low-resistance , high-velocity , concentric training ( L ) ( HLH3 ) ; ( 4 ) 2 d/wk mixed model consist high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 1 d/wk low-resistance , high-velocity , concentric train 1 d/wk ( HL2 ) . For Aim 1 , hypothesize HLH3 prescription would prove optimal overall combined gain muscle mass , strength , power , fatigue resistance woman men , HL2 would least effective program due insufficient weekly loading . Specific Aim 2 . Myofiber hypertrophy require net muscle protein synthesis , advance fiber expansion facilitate nuclear addition . We conduct comprehensive evaluation : ( 1 ) key regulatory step protein synthesis/degradation machinery ; ( 2 ) myonuclear addition satellite cell activation/cell cycle regulation . Quantitative relationship metabolic/molecular response magnitude muscle hypertrophy among old adult enable u identify underlying factor respond differently four resistance training model , potentially gender-specific manner , thus reveal important process drive hypertrophy adaptation . We hypothesize muscle protein synthesis myonuclear addition , along key underlie regulatory process , would favorably affected work-recovery cycle 2 d/wk high-resistance loading ( HLH3 HH2 model ) , thereby optimize anabolic environment muscle hypertrophy old woman men . Specific Aim 3 . To translate finding Aim 1 clinically important outcome , determine degree non-traditional resistance training program lead improvement mobility function weight-bearing exercise difficulty . We hypothesize less stressful weekly training regimen consist few high-resistance contraction ( HLH3 ) and/or few training session ( HH2 ) achieve substantial hypertrophy would promote equal good improvement mobility function weight-bearing exercise difficulty traditionally prescribed HHH3 program .</detailed_description>
