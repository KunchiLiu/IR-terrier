	<brief_title>GLP-1 Analogs Neuroprotection After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In comatose patient resuscitate hospital cardiac arrest , neurological injury remain leading cause death . The in-hospital mortality report 30-50 % , total mortality , although improve substantially last decade , remain significant , country 90 % . The brain patient resuscitate cardiac arrest ( CA ) may suffer ischemia spontaneous circulation re-established , subsequent reperfusion may cause damage . Brain ischemia reperfusion injury lead tissue degeneration loss neurological function , extent dependent duration density insult . Temperature control mild induce hypothermia ( MIH ) ( 33-36°C ) mitigate damage experimental set clinical trial show promising result improve neurological function survival . Recent large scale clinical trial however investigate milder degree hypothermia setting , suggest role active neuroprotection outside temperature management . Also recently , increase attention possible role Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) neuroprotection raise , context ameliorate degenerative disease reduce inflammation ischemic cerebral stroke . Several experimental study show GLP-1 analog beneficial effect treatment various degenerative neurological disease Alzheimer 's disease Parkinson 's disease . GLP-1 analog show reduce brain infarct size mice focal brain ischemia well reduce heart infarct size swine model myocardial infarction . Recent clinical testing human demonstrate benefit GLP-1 infusion myocardial infarct size large salvage index patient myocardial infarction . The GLP-1 analog infuse acutely ill patient many way similar cardiac arrest patient increase risk adverse event . This study double blind randomize study seek evaluate potential neuroprotective effect GLP-1 analog infuse comatose patient hospital cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
