A standard practice bone scan documentation least 2 bone lesion use long within 3 month plan start treatment . If bone scan within 3 month window available , technetium 99m NaF PET bone scan obtain screening ( within 28 day plan start study drug ) Eligible treatment paclitaxel single agent , follow assessment investigator . If treatment paclitaxel already initiate signing informed consent , patient eligible . For woman : documentation menopausal status : pre menopausal post menopausal subject . Post menopausal status define either : one year amenorrhea absence biological physiological cause , surgical menopause bilateral oophorectomy . Women men reproductive potential must agree use adequate contraception sexually active . This applies time period signing informed consent form 6 month last radium Ra 223 dichloride administration . These procedure document source document , investigator designate associate request advise subject achieve birth control . Women childbearing potential must serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day start study treatment , negative result must document start study treatment Life expectancy least 16 week Adequate bone marrow function assess within 7 day start study treatment , judge follow laboratory value : Platelet count ≥ 100.000/cubic millimeter ( mm3 ) , within 7 day start study treatment AND Hemoglobin ( HB ) ≥ 9.0g/dl , within 7 day start study treatment AND Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 within 7 day start study treatment Adequate liver function assess within 7 day start study treatment , judge follow laboratory value : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) ( except subject document Gilbert 's disease ) AND Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN subject whose cancer involve liver include liver metastasis ) within 7 day start study treatment AND Albumin &gt; 30 g/L within 7 day start study treatment International normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless receive treatment therapeutic anticoagulation . Patients treat anticoagulant , e.g . heparin , allow participate provide prior evidence underlie abnormality parameter exist INR patient &lt; 3 . Close monitoring least weekly evaluation perform INR PTT stable base predose measurement define local standard care If patient newer generation therapeutic blood thin agent without requirement monitoring ( e.g . Xarelto , Dabigatran ) , patient eligible management ( e.g . discontinuation anticoagulant ) handle good medical practice standard direction investigator Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 Estimated creatinine clearance ( CLCr ) ≥ 30 mL/min calculate use CockcroftGault equation History malignancy could affect compliance protocol interpretation result . Received systemic therapy radionuclides ( e.g. , strontium 89 , samarium 153 , rhenium 186 , rhenium 188 radium 223 ) , include radium Ra 223 dichloride , treatment bone metastases Previous ( within 4 week prior first treatment within study ) concomitant participation another clinical study investigational medicinal product ( ) Imminent establish spinal cord compression base clinical finding and/or MRI .
