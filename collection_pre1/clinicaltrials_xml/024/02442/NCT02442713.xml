	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder associate several sleep Polysomnograph ( PSG ) finding : ( 1 ) impair sleep continuity ; ( 2 ) non-REM ( NREM ) change ; ( 3 ) enhance rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep . The first two pattern common psychiatric disorder , REM pattern characteristic depression , phase-advance theory accepted psychiatrist . Many researcher focus biological rhythm investigate etiological pathophysiology depression , think depression cure sleep abnormality ameliorate . It well known antidepressant treat depression 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) neuron . 5-HT also affect regulation sleep-wake cycle sleep microarchitecture . Many all-night PSG study show tricyclic antidepressant ameliorate sleep architecture abnormality depression produce rapid suppression REM sleep . Compared TCAs , SSRIs generally less sedating high selectivity serotonin receptor . On hand , know , although SSRIs mainly increase extracellular serotonin level inhibit serotonin transport presynaptic neuron , SSRI unique pharmacological characteristic . For example , report accumulate research serum melatonin level increase markedly ingestion fluvoxamine . The mechanism behind effect unknown , one possibility increase melatonin synthesis , cause effect serotonin , melatonin precursor . Another possibility fluvoxamine inhibit metabolism melatonin liver . Thus , property fluvoxamine increase serum melatonin level , even recover circadian rhythm melatonin depress patient , might improve clinical outcome improve sleep quality quantity . By , change sleep architecture fluvoxamine treatment assess three clinical trial , result contradictive . This discrepancy might due small sample size different study design , clinical trial duration . Moreover , two three research apply home-based PSG assessment , might distort result sleep architecture extent . Thus , effect fluvoxamine sleep architecture need clarify clinical trial standard PSG assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Fluvoxamine Polysonogram Depressed Patients With Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate effect fluvoxamine polysomnographic ( PSG ) variables clinical improvement treatment depressive patient insomnia . This 8-week open-label study . All patient require meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) [ 48 criterion MDD , single recurrent type , moderate-to-high level illness severity , evidence 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD ) score &gt; 17 [ 49 , 50 ] . Furthermore , depress patient suffer insomnia , determine total score sleep disturbance factor HRSD &gt; 3 ( item 4 , 5 , 6 ; score range , 0-6 ) . Before procedure study , patient would explain detail potential risk benefit study sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . Patients discontinue study time inform consent . Also , study approve Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) Guang Dong Mental Health Center compliance content declaration Helsinki . After 7-day wash-out period 2 night PSG ( first night adaptive second night baseline ) , 30 depressive patient administer fluvoxamine 50 mg/day 1st day . The dosage fluvoxamine would titrate 8-week treatment , maximum low 300 mg/day . The primary endpoint change PSG variable baseline 56th Day . The secondary endpoint change subjective sleep quality clinical performance baseline 56th Day . Their sleep quality evaluate Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , clinical performance evaluate HRSD Clinical Globe Impression ( CGI ) .</detailed_description>
