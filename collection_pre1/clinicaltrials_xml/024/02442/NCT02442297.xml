	<brief_summary>This study patient type brain cancer call Glioblastoma ( GBM ) . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting immune cell present blood kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . The antibody use study call anti-HER2 ( Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ) . This antibody stick GBM cell substance outside cell call HER2 . Up 80 % GBMs positive HER2 . HER2 antibody use treat people HER2-positive cancer . For study , HER2 antibody change instead float free blood attach T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) . These CAR-T cell seem able kill tumor like one patient , n't last long chance fight cancer limit . Therefore , develop way prolong life T cell help fight cancer . These HER2-CAR T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find large safe dose HER2-CAR T cell , learn side effect , see whether experimental intervention might help patient GBM volunteer test new agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First , find HER2 express patient 's GBM , investigator need obtain tissue block tissue specimen use make original diagnosis . If enough material , investigator may also look protein may target sort immune therapy future . Up 90mls ( 18 tsp ) blood draw two occasion total 180mls ( 36tsp ) . The total amount blood drawn 3 ml ( le 1 teaspoon ) per 2.2 lb body weight . To make HER2 CAR T cell investigator introduce HER2 CAR gene patient 's T cell . To get HER2 antibody attach surface T cell , investigator insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help investigator find T cell patient 's blood inject . Most cell generate frozen store give back patient . This dose escalation study . This mean beginning , patient start low dose ( 1 3 different level ) T cell . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 3 dose level study . If side effect severe , dose lower T-cell infusion stop . The patient give single injection cell special catheter neurosurgeon implant tumor cavity leave brain surgical removal . Before patient receives injection , may give dose Tylenol . The injection take 1 10 minute . The patient admit overnight observation T-cell injection . The injection T cell give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital . If patient stable disease ( tumor grow ) , reduction size patient 's tumor imaging study , patient 's disease progress health status stable T-cell injection ( least 6 week ) , receive additional dos T cell 6 12 week interval wish . Additional dos T cell give current dose assess study . Therefore , dose patient receive additional dos may higher initial dose receive . Before treated , patient receive series standard medical test : physical exam , blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function , ' pregnancy test patient female could potentially become pregnant might pregnant , measurement patient 's tumor routine image study . The patient receive standard medical test get infusion : physical exam , blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function , measurements patient 's tumor routine image study 6 week infusion . To learn way HER2-CAR T cell work long last body , extra amount blood , base patient 's weight , maximum 60 mL ( 12 teaspoon ) blood take day T-cell infusion ( 1 4 hour T-cell infusion ) , 3-4 day infusion ( one optional ) , 1 , 2 , 4 6 week T-cell infusion every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , yearly total 15 year . This volume consider safe , may decrease patient anemic . This sample keep coded manner study staff may identify patient . During time point list , T cell find patient 's blood certain amount , extra 5ml blood may need collect additional testing . To see long-term side effect gene transfer , investigator follow patient 15 year . If patient receive additional T-cell infusion first one , test blood draw describe . If patient tumor biopsy lumbar puncture obtain CSF perform time study , sample request research purpose . If patient develop second abnormal growth , significant blood nervous system disorder trial , biopsy sample tissue test research purpose ( sample obtain ) .</detailed_description>
