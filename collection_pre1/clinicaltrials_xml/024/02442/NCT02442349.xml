	<brief_summary>A Phase II , Open Label , Single-arm Study Assess Safety Efficacy AZD9291 Asia Pacific Patients Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease Progressed Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy whose Tumours harbour T790M mutation within Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Single Arm Study AZD9291 Treat NSCLC Patients Asia Pacific</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open label , single arm study assess safety efficacy AZD9291 ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) Asia Pacific patient confirm diagnosis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) sensitise mutation positive ( ie , G719X , exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q ) T790M mutation positive ( hereafter refer EGFRm+ T790M+ ) un-resectable , locally advanced metastatic NSCLC ( Stage IIIB-IV ) , progress Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) , either first line treatment follow one line EGFR-TKI one line platinum contain doublet chemotherapy . Patients must agree provide biopsy central confirmation T790M mutation status follow confirm disease progression recent treatment regimen . The primary objective study assess efficacy AZD9291 assessment Objective Response Rate accord RECIST 1.1 Independent Central Review .</detailed_description>
