ATSs individualize treatment via decision rule specify type intensity intervention sequence base baseline risk factor and/or adjust base variable collect mid-treatment , response treatment . Suicidality frequent presenting concern among college student seek treatment ; yet , study population show student respond rapidly treatment whereas others may require considerably resource . However , time , CCCs , overburden often resort waitlists , guidance sequence different approach suicidal student empirically-based cost effective manner .
