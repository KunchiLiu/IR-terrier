	<detailed_description>Being involve combat horrific experience substantially increase risk develop posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Although several effective treatment identify PTSD substantial number patient ( 50 % ) continue experience symptom . The field neuroscience reveal patient PTSD demonstrate alter functioning within , interaction , several brain region ; finding consistent animal model chronic stress . Despite evidence , exist treatment generally design use neuroanatomical knowledge . The central premise propose study neuroscientifically-based information use develop precise effective treatment . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) use attempt `` correct '' dysfunctional brain region ( communication region ) , expectation modulation result symptom improvement . The primary goal study verify maladaptive brain network establish evidence tDCS modulates network . Subsequent study , perform later study year , examine dose-response relationship synergistic effect tDCS exist treatment . Outcome assess use multi-method approach include functional connectivity use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data , neuropsychological test , self-report measure emotional functioning . The combined result provide vital methodological , mechanistic , practical information necessary formal clinical trial tDCS PTSD .</detailed_description>
