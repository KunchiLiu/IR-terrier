	<brief_title>Safety Dose-finding Study DC-TAB Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study DC-TAB healthy human volunteer . DC-TAB solution small heat-shock protein alpha B-crystallin intravenous injection , design induce selective immunological tolerance treatment multiple sclerosis . In first-in-man study , DC-TAB administer healthy subject vary dos vary number time , safety tolerability evaluate , well impact treatment antigen-specific response peripheral blood T cell serum antibody . Blood sample additionally collect measure serum concentration DC-TAB , determine rate clearance circulation . The study double blind placebo-controlled strengthen significance especially immunological evaluation . The study consist two part . In Part 1 , subject receive single dose DC-TAB placebo whereas Part 2 , ( different ) subject receive DC-TAB placebo 3 consecutive day . In Part 1 , four group subject ( n=10 ) study single dose , dose-escalation design . Each group subject randomize receive either DC-TAB ( n=8 ) placebo ( n=2 ) . In Part 2 , three group subject ( n=12 ) study multiple dose , dose-escalation design . Each group subject randomize receive either DC-TAB ( n=9 ) placebo ( n=3 ) daily 3 consecutive day . The next high dose group part study start safety data 4 day Part 1 , 8 day Part 2 previous dose group review raise safety concern . Part 2 started safety data Part 1 reviewed . Immunological effect treatment evaluate period 28 day .</detailed_description>
