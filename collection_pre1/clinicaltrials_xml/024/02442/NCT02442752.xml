	<detailed_description>The drug test study call dexlansoprazole . Dexlansoprazole test find safe well-tolerated dose assess dexlansoprazole process body infant age 1 11 month . This study look side effect lab result infant take dexlansoprazole . The study enroll approximately 24 participant . Participants randomly assign 1 4 treatment group base body weight age : - Dexlansoprazole 10 mg - Dexlansoprazole 15 mg - Dexlansoprazole 20 mg - Dexlansoprazole 30 mg Participants weigh &lt; 3.4 kg enrol . Participants ≤ 10 week age body weight ≥ 3.4 kg initially receive Regimen A ( dexlansoprazole delayed-release 10 mg capsule ) . Randomization participant &gt; 10 week age stratify weight group . Participants whose baseline weight ≥ 3.4 kg &lt; 4.1 kg assign receive Regimen A Regimen B ( dexlansoprazole delayed-release 10 15 mg capsule initial dose ) ratio 1:1 . Participants whose weight ≥ 4.1 kg &lt; 6.2 kg assign receive Regimens B C ( dexlansoprazole delayed-release 15 20 mg capsule initial dose ) ratio 1:1 . Participants whose weight ≥ 6.2 kg assign receive Regimen B , C , D ( dexlansoprazole delayed-release 15 , 20 , 30 mg capsule initial dose ) ratio 1:1:2 . All participant administer 1 capsule dexlansoprazole morning time day throughout study . The study medication may administer participant open capsule sprinkle granule 1 tablespoon applesauce puree apple , mix capsule granule 20 mL water . The food-granule mixture administer immediately . The water mixed granule administer via oral syringe mouth immediately . The granule chew mouth . The food liquid use administer study medication record Days 1 Confinement Day 1 . The parent participant ask record dosing information , food liquid use administer study medication ( Day 1 Confinement Day 1 ) , food intake , episodes vomit diary Day 2 day Confinement Day 1 ( Day 5 9 ) . This multicenter trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 114 day . Participants make multiple visit clinic , include two 2-day visit may require confinement clinic , contact telephone 30 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
