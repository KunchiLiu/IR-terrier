	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine effect routine anesthesia infant brain oxygen level . The investigator know anesthesia effect blood flow brain infant surgery . This study help investigator detect possible blood flow change brain infant undergoing anesthesia . A monitor sensor ( NIRS near-infrared spectroscopy ) use light measure oxygen level blood use . Sensors rest child 's skin record measurement , surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peri-operative NIRS Monitoring In Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-operatively medical history collect along baseline physiological data ( Blood pressure , heart rate , date birth , date surgery , weight , gestational age birth , gender , medical condition , medication ) . Given importance reliable blood pressure measurement- study , strict guideline regard proper blood pressure cuff placement choice cuff size follow . An upper extremity cuff index line use make sure cuff appropriately size . NIRS sensor apply pre-operatively operate room prior induction anesthesia . All NIRS value collect blind value influence anesthetic management clinical decision . Intra-operatively NIRS value blindly record , physiological data detail anesthesia ( conduct clinical monitoring , include blood pressure measurement anesthesia affect way study ) . No additional blood pressure measurement make . One week later hospital record ( infant still hospitalize ) review evidence new change neurological status ( specifically seizures generalized focal neurological deficit note clinical team record physical exam ) . For infant discharge home prior one week surgery , phone call make inquire occurrence event require medical attention treatment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Less 6 month Scheduled intubation/anesthesia clinical purpose surgical procedure Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) Main operate room expect last long 30 minute Children application NIRS would impractical : example surgery head neck . Children schedule cardiac surgery Children known major cardiovascular shunt Children know suspect neurological abnormality</criteria>
