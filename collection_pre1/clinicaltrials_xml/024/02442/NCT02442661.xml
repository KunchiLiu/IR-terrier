	<brief_summary>This research study perform compare accuracy two method lymph node evaluation : research method versus standard method . Standard method usually perform standard care radiologist evaluate image overall decide whether node see biopsied . In research method , second radiologist evaluate ultrasound image lymph node separately , use small specific checklist ultrasound appearance determine whether node biopsied . Results standard research method use decide node ( ) , biopsied . Neck ultrasound examination , lymph node evaluation standard method subsequent lymph node biopsy part standard clinical care . It less likely possible research method may identify additional lymph node biopsy check lymph node contains thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
