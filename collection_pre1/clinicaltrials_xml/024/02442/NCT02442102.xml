	<brief_summary>An early intervention swallow disorder ( i.e. , dysphagia ) endotracheal intubation may improve patient outcomes . The investigator propose treatment session target sensorimotor integration , strength , range motion oral endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation reduce prevent dysphagia aspiration ( food liquid enter airway ) , establish solid foundation understand reason swallow impairment extubation mechanical ventilation learn new method reduce prevent problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal study evaluate patient acute respiratory failure time orally intubated ICU : 1 ) investigate tongue weakness pathophysiological aspect dysphagia , 2 ) evaluate , Phase II clinical trial , novel , multimodal , sensorimotor intervention conduct intubation reduce prevent dysphagia extubation . Patients expect intubated mechanical ventilation &gt; 96 hour consecutively enrol shortly intubation . Laryngeal function , tongue strength , swallow pathophysiology , breathing-swallowing coordination evaluate valid reliable standardized measure . While orally intubate , patient treatment group receive novel , early , sensorimotor intervention 60-minutes daily , 5 time per week , target improve swallow physiology kinematics reduce aspiration dysphagia . These daily session continue completion modify barium swallow study conduct within approximately 2 day extubation , thereafter standard clinical care resume . Patients control group receive standard clinical care intubation throughout hospital stay . All patient follow hospital discharge determine pathophysiological clinical impact propose intervention . Knowledge study provide important data novel intervention provide critical foundation understand physiological mechanism dysphagia aspiration intubation patient acute respiratory failure . With success , investigation help shift clinical practice pattern consider early intervention goal reduce frequency severity swallow impairment lead aspiration additional medical complication .</detailed_description>
