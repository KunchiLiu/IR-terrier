	<brief_title>Comparing Early Capsule Deployment Current Standard Care Management Gastrointestinal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After 40 year consider gastrointestinal bleeding upper lower largely ignore small intestine , accumulate evidence standard care approach assessment non-hematemesis gastrointestinal bleeding could improve early deployment video capsule ( VCE ) first diagnostic test . Currently , VCE consider gold standard diagnostic test small intestinal bleeding . In recent study University Massachusetts ( UMass ) 336 patient present emergency department ( ED ) complaints gastrointestinal bleed 36 patient ( 10.7 % ) give VCE stay . In patient hematemesis , upper endoscopy remain diagnostic therapeutic modality choice . However patient melena hematochezia may benefit early VCE since sign symptom provide poor localization origin bleed . Data previous Umass study suggest ingestion VCE ED could quickly non-invasively provide clinician accurate data origin bleed . This information could provide guide management patient . VCE able visualize bleed esophagus , stomach , duodenum , small intestine right colon , thereby eliminate guess work decide endoscopic approach use . At UMass , study show 36 patient receive video capsule , 26 ( 72.2 % ) diagnostic study ( i.e . bleed identify ) . In comparison , 152 patient require upper endoscopy ( 52.9 % diagnostic ) 64 patient require colonoscopy ( 47 % diagnostic ) . Of 26 patient diagnostic capsule study , 13 also require upper endoscopy , 1 require colonoscopy , 4 require colonoscopy endoscopy . It important recognize , however , often capsule study perform upper endoscopy colonoscopy perform found negative . This sequence standard care work bleeding . Despite perform later hospital course patient , capsule study high diagnostic yield . In reality VCE use uncommonly acute bleed rarely consider context acute GI bleeding In study , investigator propose approach use video capsule first diagnostic test prior colonoscopy endoscopy ; may lead shortened time diagnosis , reduction length stay , reduction number procedure due early , accurate localization source bleeding . All component could result good quality care cost containment . Further , know 80 % patient stop bleed spontaneously . Thus earlier examine likely origin bleed likely find The use VCE approve FDA since 2001 small intestinal bleeding obscure GI Bleeding . It safe death associate use report . More two million capsule use complication obstruction perforation extremely rare . Interest broader use VCE accumulating . More recently study VCE deploy ED , patient upper GI bleeding show improved management . Our group recently demonstrate close VCE perform time bleed high likelihood locate source higher therapeutic intervention rate . The investigator also demonstrate use capsule endoscopy patient NHGIB high diagnostic yield colonoscopy . With improved diagnostic yield , capsule endoscopy may help clinician provide guidance management patient NHGIB . This protocol first attempt prospectively examine concept large randomize prospective trial . The question investigator study : early capsule intervention decrease time diagnosis , number procedure hospital length stay patient non-hematemesis gastrointestinal bleeding ?</detailed_description>
