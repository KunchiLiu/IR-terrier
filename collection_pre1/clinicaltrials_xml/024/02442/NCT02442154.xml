	<brief_title>Early Tracheostomy Versus Standard Care Patients With Severe Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction ; Most patient severe head injury protect airway , excessive secretion inadequate spontaneous breathe contributes cerebral hypoxia . Thus , initial management airway secure either endotracheal tube ( ETT ) tracheostomy . In Mulago Hospital patient intubate subjected wait see strategy delay tracheostomy , undergo early tracheostomy , patient leave without artificial airway . Tracheostomy report advantage translaryngeal intubation optimal time tracheostomy patient severe head injury controversial . Studies do elsewhere show patient severe head injury undergo early tracheostomy well outcomes . Problem statement ; Mulago hospital receive large number patient severe head injured mortality rate 69 % . Securing patient airway use ETT associate complication show increase ICU hospital stay , morbidity mortality . Furthermore , intubate patient often require ICU admission care ETT mechanical ventilation yet patient require little assistance mechanical ventilation airway secured tracheostomy . With limited number ventilator bed ICU increase demand ICU admission Mulago hospital , pose challenge . Objective ; To compare 30 day mortality severe head injured patient undergo early tracheostomy versus standard care Mulago Hospital associate factor Methodology ; Randomized control clinical trial , open label , carry Mulago Hospital Trauma Centre , casualty , ICU , neuro-surgical ward high dependence unit ( 3AHDU ) . All patient 10years severe traumatic brain injury meet study criterion recruit randomly assign either arm . The patient early tracheostomy arm undergo tracheostomy , do Otolaryngologist ( ENT surgeon ) resident within 24 hour admission , admit either trauma center , ICU space available , Neurosurgery ward HDU . Patients receive routine care severe head injured patient per Mulago hospital standard . On arm patient receive standard care per attend clinician , also admit either trauma Centre , ICU Neurosurgery ward HDU also receive routine care severe head injured patient per Mulago hospital standard . Follow primary outcome 30day mortality The patient arm follow maximum 30 day To assess ; Acute complication tracheostomy ( bleeding , subcutaneous emphysema , pneumothorax ) Number day mechanical ventilator development ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) mechanically ventilated patient use ; increase respiratory rate , FiO2 , temperature White blood cell count baseline , consistency tracheal aspirate culture tracheal aspirate . Number day patient require sedation sedate patient . Length ICU hospital stay glasgow coma scale ( GCS ) discharge .</detailed_description>
