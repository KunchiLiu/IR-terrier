	<brief_title>A Trial Tolvaptan Children Adolescent Subjects With Euvolemic Hypervolemic Hyponatremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study also assess tolvaptan 's pharmacokinetics ( PK ) effect fluid balance child adolescent subject euvolemic hypervolemic hyponatremia . Subjects diagnose euvolemic hypervolemic hyponatremia ( serum sodium &lt; 130 mEq/L [ mmol/L ] ) persist despite initial standard background therapy ( eg , include fluid restriction ) eligible screen participation trial . Subjects demonstrate prior resistance vasopressin antagonist therapy exclude . All potential subject must deem investigator likely benefit therapy raise serum sodium level . Subjects required hospital set initiation titration tolvaptan . Overall , trial , subject undergo treatment tolvaptan placebo 30 ( +2 ) day post-last dose follow-up phase 14 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female subject ≥ 4 year age ( per local Health Authority age restriction ) &lt; 18 year old ≥ 10kg 2 . Subjects hospitalize euvolemic hypervolemic hyponatremia resistant initial standard background therapy ( include fluid restriction exclude vasopressin antagonist ) deem investigator likely benefit therapy raise serum sodium level 3 . Persistent euvolemic hypervolemic hyponatremia define documented present least 48 hour , evidence least 2 serum sodium assessment &lt; 130 mmol/L draw least 12 hour apart ( value document use historical value previously obtain per standard care ) ; third ( STAT ) serum sodium assessment &lt; 130 mmol/L , serve baseline value efficacy endpoint , obtain within 24 hour prior final trial qualification first dose IMP 4 . Ability swallow tablet 5 . Ability maintain adequate fluid intake whether orally via IV support adequate monitoring 6 . Ability comply requirement trial 7 . Trialspecific write informed consent/assent obtain parent/legal guardian legally acceptable representative , applicable per age subject local law , prior initiation protocol require procedure . In addition , subject require local law must provide informed assent Screening must able understand withdraw trial time . All informed consent/assent procedure must accordance trial center 's IRB/IEC local regulatory requirement 8 . Ability commit remain fully abstinent ( periodic abstinence [ eg , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception ) practice doublebarrier birth control trial 30 day follow last dose IMP sexually active female childbearing potential 1 . Has evidence hypovolemia intravascular volume depletion ( eg , hypotension , clinical evidence volume depletion , response saline challenge ) ; subject systolic blood pressure heart rate outside normal range age volume status specifically clinically assessed rule volume depletion 2 . Has serum sodium &lt; 120 mmol/L , without associate neurologic impairment ( ie , symptom apathy , confusion , seizure ) 3 . Subjects ≤ 50 kg take potent CYP3A4 inhibitor subject &lt; 20 kg take moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor within 72 hour prior dose 4 . Lacks free access water ( inability respond thirst ) without ICUlevel fluid monitor management 5 . Has history current diagnosis nephrotic syndrome 6 . Has transient hyponatremia likely resolve ( eg , head trauma postoperative state ) 7 . Has hyperkalemia define serum potassium ULN appropriate pediatric age range 8 . Has eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculate following equation : eGFR ( mL/min/1.73 m2 ) = 0.413 x height ( cm ) /serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 9 . Has AKI recent medical history define : Increase serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL ( ≥ 26.5 µmol/L ) within 48 hour ; Increase serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 time baseline , know presumed occur within prior 7 day ; Urine volume &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h 6 hour 10 . Has severe acute neurological symptom require intervention ( eg , hyperemesis , obtundation , seizure ) 11 . Has treatment hyponatremia : Hypertonic saline ( include normal saline challenge ) within 8 hour qualify serum sodium assessment ; Urea , lithium , demeclocycline , conivaptan , tolvaptan within 4 day qualify serum sodium assessment ; Other treatment purpose increase serum sodium concurrent dose IMP 12 . Has anuria urinary outflow obstruction , unless subject , , catheterize trial 13 . Has history drug medication abuse within 3 month prior Screening current alcohol abuse 14 . Has history hypersensitivity and/or idiosyncratic reaction benzazepine benzazepine derivative ( benazepril ) 15 . Has psychogenic polydipsia ( subject psychiatric illness may include per medical monitor approval ) 16 . Has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , define fast glucose &gt; 300 mg/dL ( 16.7 mmol/L ) 17 . Has screen liver function value ( ALT/AST ) &gt; 3 x ULN 18 . Has cirrhosis meet follow condition : major GI bleed within past 6 month , evidence active bleeding ( eg , epistaxis , petechiae/purpura , hematuria , hematochezia ) , platelet count &lt; 50,000/µL , use concomitant medication know increase bleed risk 19 . Has hyponatremia due result medication safely withdrawn ( eg , thiazide diuretic ) 20 . Has hyponatremia ( eg , hyponatremia set adrenal insufficiency , untreated hypothyroidism , hypotonic fluid administration ) appropriately correct alternative therapy 21 . Is currently pregnant breastfeed 22 . Has medical condition , opinion investigator , could interfere evaluation trial objective safety subject . 23 . Is deem unsuitable trial participation opinion investigator 24 . Participation another investigational drug trial within past 30 day , without prior approval sponsor medical monitor 25 .
