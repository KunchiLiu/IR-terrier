	<detailed_description>Setting : The study conduct September 2014 April 2018 short stay unit Pediatric Emergency Center ( PEC ) Hamad General Hospital , pediatric emergency facility State Qatar . The PEC serve average 280 000 patient annually manage 42 bed short stay infirmary unit , patient admit ill send home need intensive care unit . Patients admit unit assess least every 6 hour pediatrician determine readiness discharge . The length stay unit bronchiolitis range 6 168 hour . In 2012 , investigator saw 8718 infant young child 10 666 visit bronchiolitis . Infants age ≤3 month present unit treatment viral bronchiolitis eligible study . Consecutive patient recruit except study nurse unavailable unit busy recruit . Procedure : Patients examine presentation , need additional treatment observation admit short stay infirmary unit . Consecutive patient bronchiolitis assess study eligibility within 2 hour . Eligible patient enrol obtain write consent . For consent , plain chest radiography , nasopharyngeal swab take RSV detection . If patient positive RSV rapid antigen test , patient randomize receive one study arm . Bronchiolitis severity score measure initially start treatment 12-hour , 24-hour , 36-hour 48-hour thereafter . The medical team addition parent patient blind medication deliver . Adverse effect group carefully monitor document . Patients send home salbutamol metered-dose inhaler appropriately size Aerochamber mask attachment . Daily follow-up study nurse telephone mandatory 1 week discharge week 2 week thereafter . The patient could return pediatric emergency center earlier need . At revisits illness , nasopharyngeal swab take RSV rapid antigen test result record . Study Intervention : - Active arm : A single dose IV palivizumab 15 mg per kilogram body weight ( maximum dose =100 mg ) . - Control arm : Placebo ( equivalent volume 0.9 % normal saline ) .</detailed_description>
