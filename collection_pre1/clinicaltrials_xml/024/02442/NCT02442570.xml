	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , exploratory , dose-ranging Phase IIa study multiple sclerosis patient evaluate safety , tolerability , T-cell tolerance induce effect , clinical effect pharmacokinetics intravenous DC-TAB , solution recombinant human alpha B-crystallin . At entry , patient randomize one treatment , placebo , 7.5 mg DC-TAB , 12.5 mg DC-TAB 17.5 mg DC-TAB 1:1:1:1 fashion . Patients receive single intravenous bolus injection repeat twice 2-month interval 6-month monitoring period . The goal injection induce antigen-specific T-cell tolerance . The study consist two part , treatment period 24 week , follow-up period additional 24 week . Patients return hospital weekly first month , monthly thereafter . The primary analysis perform data collect treatment period , perform patient complete 24 week study . An additional analysis perform patient complete full 48 week study . Patients site study personnel remain blind throughout study . After 12 24 patient complete 4 week study , 24 patient complete 12 week follow-up , partially blind safety review conduct independent drug safety monitor board verify safety intervention MS patient .</detailed_description>
