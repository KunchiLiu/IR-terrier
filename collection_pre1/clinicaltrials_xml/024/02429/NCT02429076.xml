	<brief_title>EEG Studies IV Methylphenidate-Induced Emergence From Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic science clinical data suggest activation one brain 's arousal pathway highly plausible way induce active emergence general anesthesia . The investigator compel experimental data demonstrate methylphenidate highly effective actively induce emergence isoflurane propofol general anesthesia rodent . The available literature suggest IV methylphenidate would safe administer patient recover general anesthesia , addition promote arousal , would enhance breathing . Both effect would highly desirable patient recover general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
