	<brief_title>A Study TRC105 Combination With Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Bevacizumab Non-Squamous Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced non-small cell lung cancer historically difficult treat , novel agent dire need.TRC105 show enhance anti-angiogenic effect bevacizumab may result effective angiogenesis inhibition improve clinical efficacy combine bevacizumab paclitaxel/carboplatin . Participants treat combination drug 6 cycle therapy ( 3 week per cycle ) may may place maintenance therapy depend upon induction response . Maintenance therapy continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal . Blood collection tumor assessment perform throughout study .</detailed_description>

Willingness ability consent self participate study . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Nonsmall cell lung cancer squamous histology . Prior treatment TRC105 . Current treatment another therapeutic clinical trial . Receipt small molecule anticancer agent , include investigational anticancer small molecule , within 14 day start study treatment . Receipt large molecule anticancer agent ( e.g. , antibody ) , include investigational anticancer antibody , within 28 day start study treatment . No major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 6 week prior study registration , must fully recovered procedure ; date surgery ( applicable ) anticipate need major surgical procedure within next six month . The follow consider major procedure permit 7 day therapy initiation : thoracentesis , paracentesis , port placement , laparoscopy , thorascopy , tube thoracostomy , bronchoscopy , endoscopic ultrasonographic procedure , mediastinoscopy , skin biopsy , incisional biopsy , imagingguided biopsy diagnostic purpose , routine dental procedure .
