	<brief_summary>In comparative-effectiveness study , investigator recruit 400 English-speaking , Spanish-speaking , bilingual heavy-drinking Mexican-origin men admit community hospital medical treatment alcohol-related injury heavy drinking . Participants randomize receive culturally adapt brief motivational intervention ( CA-BMI ) non-adapted brief motivational intervention ( NA-BMI ) . The primary outcome interest include alcohol use , alcohol problem , treatment utilization . Secondary outcome include therapeutic alliance rating social support . Telephone follow-up assessment complete 3 , 6 , 12 month post-treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-Adapted Brief Motivational Intervention : The core component NA-BMI consistent person-centered approach MI include 1 ) provide personalize feedback base screen baseline assessment result ; 2 ) explore decisional balance ( pros con ) alcohol use patient 's perspective ; 3 ) building motivation change assessment discussion patient ' selfreport level importance , confidence , readiness change drinking ; 4 ) enhance commitment change explore patient 's option change develop change plan indicate desire ; 5 ) providing referral formal treatment alcohol problem community resource . The NA-BMI specifically target cultural risk protective factor beyond normal tailoring may occur standard BMI describe current literature . In NA-BMI , personalize feedback base drinking norm frequency alcohol problem U.S. general population . Culturally Adapted Brief Motivational Intervention : CA-BMI also adhere core principle MI practice BMI . In CA-BMI , core component NA-BMI adapt culturally responsive unique risk ( acculturative stress ) protective ( familism ) factor associate heavy drinking , alcohol problem , help seek , treatment utilization among Latinos . It important note CA-BMI go well beyond tailor may occur NA-BMI target factor important predictor drink among Latinos . Specifically , two primary adaptation CA-BMI : 1 . CA-BMI incorporate assessment personalize feedback impact acculturative stress drinking decrease temptation drink increase confidence avoid drinking . Specifically , participant receive feedback type intensity acculturative stress may experience ( e.g. , issue relate immigration , cultural congruity , language barrier , employment discrimination ) , clinicians elicit relationship acculturative stress temptation confidence avoid drinking . 2 . CA-BMI also integrate family community reason change agent behavior change consider impact drinking , plan change drink behavior , engagement help-seeking behavior . Following method develop Lee et al . ( 2011 ) AÃ±ez et al . ( 2008 ) , consultant grant , investigator incorporate discussion social context family dynamic related drinking . These modification result culturally adapt intervention substantially distinct content focus ( e.g. , deep structural change ) non-adapted intervention , maintain consistency motivational interviewing application brief alcohol intervention . In accord two central adaptation , investigator anticipate potential mediator mechanisms behavior change specific CA-BMI 1 ) temptation drink confidence avoid drink 2 ) increase support family friends general well specific support change drink behavior seek treatment . Finally , investigator also evaluate definition treatment utilization comprehensive investigator prior study , assess use formal inpatient outpatient substance abuse treatment attendance self-help group Alcoholics Anonymous ( Field , et al. , 2010 ) . In current study , investigator assess engagement formal treatment network well informal help-seeking common among Latinos ( e.g. , seek help family , religious leader , respect elder community ) . Statistical Analyses Preliminary Analyses : Standard examinations outlier , data distribution , internal consistency measure conduct . For mixed model , investigator assess homogeneity error normality residual level model , test multivariate normality random effect , examine linearity , identify outlier . For structural equation model ( SEM ) , investigator follow best practice guideline outline Boomsma ( 2000 ) analyze report SEM model . Investigators also compare group demographic pretest variable assess whether randomization produce equivalent group ; event nonequivalent variable , variable include covariates model . Data Analysis Specific Aim 1 : Analyses investigate group difference alcohol problem treatment utilization use random coefficient model ( Raudenbush &amp; Bryk , 2002 ; Singer &amp; Willett , 2003 ) . Investigators construct longitudinal model use follow sequence analytic step recommend Singer Willett ( 2003 ) : 1 ) examine empirical growth plot ; 2 ) fit unconditional mean model ; 3 ) fit unconditional linear growth model ; 4 ) fit unconditional non-linear model ( e.g. , piecewise model ) ; 5 ) determine best model longitudinal change compare model previous two step use Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) ; ( f ) select appropriate error covariance structure use AIC ; 6 ) add level-2 predictor ( e.g. , intervention condition ) . Models binary outcome ( e.g. , treatment utilization ) use generalize linear mixed-effects model assume binary distribution logistic link function . Data Analysis Specific Aim 2 : Potential moderator examine construct interaction term treatment priori moderator variable ( e.g. , acculturative stress ) examine possibility relationship putative moderator outcome differ across treatment ( Aiken &amp; West , 1991 ) . In event significant interaction indicate moderation , investigator probe relationship method appropriate multilevel model ( Bauer &amp; Curran , 2005 ) . Mediation analysis conduct use growth-curve framework implement SEM . Models construct first fitting growth model mediator outcomes fit mediational growth model . Investigators follow sequence describe establish best model longitudinal change Aim 1 . Latent growth model comprise least two latent factor ; one factor represent initial status , one factor represent growth rate variable , one factor require event non-linear change ( e.g. , quadratic term ) . Mediation examine follow recommendation MacKinnon ( 2008 ) assess mediation growth model context . The growth factor mediator regress initial status mediator , outcome , intervention group . A significant effect intervention group establish relation intervention group mediator , control baseline level mediator outcome . Next , growth factor regress initial status mediator , outcome , slope mediator , intervention group . A significant effect mediator growth factor establish relation change mediator change outcome , control baseline level mediator outcome . Data Analysis Aim 3 : Responses patient interventionist satisfaction assessment work alliance compile aggregate form . The frequency responses individual item report patient interventionists . Likewise , scale score patient provider report use mean standard deviation . Comparison responses patient interventionist make use chisquare case frequency data t-tests case scale score . Organizational readiness assess use pretest-posttest design . The analysis pretest-posttest comparison employ Analysis Covariance ANCOVA . In nonrandomized design , main purpose ANCOVA adjust posttest mean difference among group pretest , difference likely occur . The purpose use pretest score covariate ANCOVA pretest-posttest design ( ) reduce error variance ( b ) eliminate systematic bias .</detailed_description>
