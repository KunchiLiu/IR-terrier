	<brief_title>Simultaneous Integrated Boost Radiotherapy Concurrent Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite application IMRT study concurrent chemoradiation esophageal carcinoma , improve 5-year survival rate 10 % 20 % -40 % decrease recurrence rate 80 % 50 % -60 % , local recurrence remain common failure pattern . Therefore , enhance local control key obtain good survival . A phase Ⅱ study radical radiotherapy IMRT simultaneous integrate boost technique concurrent chemotherapy esophageal carcinoma use radiation dose high dose arm RTOG 94-05 , reveals significantly improve median survival time 23 month 3-year overall survival rate 44.4 % . This study imply simultaneous integrated boost technique may effective extent . But question identify patient may gain potential benefit , whether therapeutic model copy specific situation China ? Few adverse effect perforation , hemorrhage stenosis report , mainly owe lack case . For widely application new technique clinic , study need conduct future obtain sufficient evidence . The current IMRT simultaneously achieve prophylactic dose ( DT 50Gy ) radical dose ( DT 60-64Gy ) respective target volume use inverse intensity-modulated planning system . However , still controversial whether esophageal carcinoma receive prescription dose 2.0Gy time . That say , challengeable find optimal fraction dose total dose tumor adverse effect . For reason , dose escalation trial conduct explore clinical value optimal dose esophageal carcinoma different radiosensitivity , also provide data support phase Ⅲ clinical trial .</detailed_description>
