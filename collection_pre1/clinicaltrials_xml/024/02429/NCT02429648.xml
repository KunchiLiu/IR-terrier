	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare strategy superior patient persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) undergo ablation , direct current cardioversion ( DCC ) prior empirical pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) ; pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) ablation atrial fibrillation Direct current cardioversion ( DCC ) patient remain atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timing Direct Current Cardioversion ( DCC ) Patients Undergoing Ablation Persistent/Permanent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ablation persistent/permanent Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) remain challenge . There several strategy improve outcomes persistent/permanent AF ablation . At Cleveland Clinic one commonly used strategy Direct Current Cardioversion ( DCC ) . Depending physician preference , patient may ablate atrial fibrillation Direct current cardioverted ; Direct current cardioverted ablated sinus rhythm . Neither approach show superior . As approach currently perform base physician preference , investigator propose study compare approach randomize fashion evidence base practice . The purpose study compare standard care strategy superior patient persistent/permanent Atrial Fibrillation undergo ablation , direct current cardioversion prior empirical pulmonary vein isolation ; ablation atrial fibrillation direct current cardioversion patient remain atrial fibrillation</detailed_description>
