	<brief_summary>Background . Anecdotal report uncontrolled study describe association generic substitution antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) adverse event , include loss seizure control . Although result likely influenced methodological bias , lead strong opposition , among physicians patient , use generic product epilepsy . Objectives . The primary objective ass potential risk associate substitution currently take AED product equivalent product , use endpoint change serum drug level steady-state substitution compare baseline . Secondary objective assessment inter-subject variability serum drug concentration unchanged treatment schedule , evaluation potential short-term change seizure control adverse event rate . Methods . The study use experimental randomize open-label non-inferiority design . The population consist 200 adult stabilize chronic treatment carbamazepine , valproic acid , topiramate , oxcarbazepine , levetiracetam lamotrigine admit hospital diagnostic evaluation indication , expect treatment change subsequent 5 6 day . Patients randomize two group . One group continue receive AED product use enrollment ( brand generic ) , whereas group switch alternative equivalent product . Dosing schedule AEDs test well comedications unaltered throughout 6- 7day period study . Serum AED level ( mean two value obtain peak trough , respectively even next morning ) measure day 1 ( baseline ) 5 day post-randomization ( 6 day patient receive AEDs half-lives 12 h ) . The primary outcome endpoint proportion patient , post-randomization , show great 25 % change serum drug concentration compare baseline . Secondary endpoint include comparison distribution rough serum concentration change group , pharmacokinetic parameter , time first seizure , total number seizure , adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective provide high-quality evidence potential risk associate substitution currently take AED product ( carbamazepine , valproic acid , topiramate , oxcarbazepine , levetiracetam lamotrigine ) equivalent product , use endpoint change serum drug level steady-state substitution compare baseline . Secondary objective assessment inter-subject variability serum drug concentration unchanged treatment schedule , evaluation potential short-term change seizure control adverse event rate . The study use experimental randomized non-inferiority design , hypothesis test substitution currently take AED product another product ( either generic brand ) associate change serum drug level great observe control group undergo substitution . The primary endpoint proportion patient post-randomization , show great 25 % change serum drug concentration compare baseline . The study conduct accord experimental , prospective , randomize , open-label control , parallel-group design . The study conduct adult either gender , enrol time hospital admission ( already hospitalize ) . On day admission inclusion study ( day 1 ) , subject fulfil eligibility criterion enrol study allocate 1:1 randomization two group , use centralize telephone-based randomization office locate coordinate institution stratification ensure proportion patient receive brand generic baseline comparable group . For subject take concomitantly one AEDs test , separate randomization conduct separately AED ( example , subject receive valproic acid carbamazepine randomize continue formulation valproic switch different formulation valproic acid , time separately randomize continue formulation carbamazepine switch different formulation carbamazepine ) . On day 1 ( day admission day inclusion study ) , subject continue receive current AED treatment , without change formulation ( brand specific generic product ) , route dosing schedule . Two blood sample determination serum level AED ( ) collect , one day 1 two hour even dose ( absorptive phase sample , close expect peak time ) one next morning ( day 2 ) prior morning dose ( trough sample ) . When randomized allocation require switch , AED ( ) currently take ( carbamazepine , valproic acid , topiramate , oxcarbazepine , levetiracetam and/or lamotrigine ) substitute , start morning dose day 2 , equivalent formulation available market . Namely , brand product switch generic , randomly choose among available market , maintain unaltered dose regimen time administration.Likewise , generic product switch brand another generic , determine randomization scheme , maintain unaltered dose regimen time administration . For AEDs commercially available immediate-release well sustained-release dose form , substitute product ( brand generic ) equivalent release characteristic . The newly allocate treatment continue unchanged 4 day ( day 2,3,4 5 ) 5 day ( day 2,3,4 , 5 6 ) patient receive lamotrigine topiramate without enzyme inducer , lamotrigine combine enzyme inducer plus valproate . No change concomitant treatment allow 5/6 day study , although addition , withdrawal dose modification drug interact pharmacokinetically medication take subject permit . When randomized allocation require continuation product ( control ) , AED product ( ) currently take continue unaltered , dose regimen time administration . No change concomitant treatment allow 5/6 day study , although addition , withdrawal dose modification drug interact pharmacokinetically medication take subject permit . In test control allocation , two blood sample determination serum level AED ( ) collect 4 day later ( 5 day later patient remain randomized treatment 5 day ) , one two hour even dose ( absorptive phase sample ) day 5 ( day 6 patient remain randomized treatment 6 day ) one next morning ( day 6 7 ) prior morning dose ( trough sample ) . Care take ensure sample day 5 6/7 collect time , relation time dose also relation actual time day meal time . A 4-day interval post-randomization pharmacokinetic assessment sufficient reach steady state AEDs expect half-lives 12 h less ( carbamazepine , levetiracetam , valproic acid , topiramate combine enzyme inducer , lamotrigine combine enzyme inducer , monohydoxyderivative ( MHD ) oxcarbazepine , oxcarbazepine prodrug ) . Likewise , 5-day interval sufficient reach steady state AEDs expect half-lives 24 h ( lamotrigine topiramate combine enzyme inducer , lamotrigine combine enzyme inducer valproic acid ) . All subject keep medical observation study daily unstructured interview additional investigation need , relevant change clinical status , include treatment-emergent adverse event , record CRF . During 6/7-day observation period , subject may undergo clinical laboratory investigation ( eg. , hematology blood chemistry test , neuroimaging test , EEGs ) clinically indicate condition . Patients exit study day 6 7 applicable thereafter manage consider indicated attend physician . This could involve substitute AED product take time compliance policy generic substitution implement hospital . If change dose AEDs test potentially interact comedication necessary prior day 5/6 , two post-randomization sample may collect 24 h earlier AEDs half live 12 h less ( carbamazepine , levetiracetam , valproic acid , topiramate combine enzyme inducer , MHD , lamotrigine combine enzyme inducer ) . Because patient half-life AED test allows attainment steady-steady condition within 72 h. After collection post-randomization sample , subject exit study . In situation require premature termination allocate treatment , subject exit study consider drop-outs evaluable pharmacokinetic outcome data . At enrollment ( baseline ) , subject 's medical pharmacological history result physical examination record . Historical data seizure type seizure frequency collect , assessment adverse effect AED therapy unstructured interview application Adverse Event Profile ( AEP ) 21-item questionnaire develop Baker et al . ( 1997 ) . The AEP questionnaire physical examination repeat day 6/7 . Occurrence seizure record daily . The AED product test include exclusively product commercially available Italian market . In accordance current regulation ( DM 17.12.2012 ) , hospital pharmacy study site stock full range available brand generic product study drug sufficient cover least 6-day treatment average dosage . All drug product store , dispense track accord GCP guideline .</detailed_description>
