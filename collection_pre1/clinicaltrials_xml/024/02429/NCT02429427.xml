	<brief_summary>It find chemical change take place patient 's body development inflammation may provide environment stimulates cancer cell . One step development inflammation production certain chemical substance important formation spread tumour . These call prostaglandin . Cyclo-oxygenase II ( COX-2 ) enzyme ( substance speed chemical change body ) involve production prostaglandin although usually present tissue make site inflammation . Celecoxib selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug ( NSAID ) work block action COX-2 enzyme , lead decrease production prostaglandin reduction inflammation . The purpose study therefore find celecoxib use breast cancer treatment ( chemotherapy and/ radiotherapy ) reduce inflammation thus reduce ability new tumour grow survive . 2590 woman primary breast cancer recruit study several location United Kingdom Germany . Eligible patient randomly allocate treatment group , celecoxib placebo . Both treatment take orally ( celecoxib 400mg daily , placebo 2 tablet daily ) total 2 year . In addition , hormone receptor positive patient receive endocrine treatment per local practice . Patients prematurely discontinue treatment celecoxib/placebo disease progression confirm patient experience unacceptable toxicity . Patients see every 6 month first 3 year treatment follow-up carry annually . Participating patient also give option take part pathology sub-study donate sample tumour tissue collect time primary surgery .</brief_summary>
