	<brief_summary>A number study document poor sleep quality troublesome symptom ( breathlessness , cough sputum production ) upon awaken patient COPD . However , investigator know little measurement respiratory mechanic ( i.e. , lung volume , respiratory pressure , diaphragm function , etc ) sleep patient . The investigator also know little modern bronchodilator therapy , time take , affect respiratory mechanic sleep severity early morning respiratory symptom . COPD often treat inhaled bronchodilator medication use open airway make easy air get lung . The investigator study effect new inhaler contain two different type long-acting bronchodilator : formoterol [ long-acting beta2-agonist ( LABA ) ] aclidinium bromide [ long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) anticholinergic ] . Initial study show combination therapy take twice daily improve lung function measurement respiratory symptom patient moderate severe COPD . There also report even administration medication may provide important advantage patient dominant nighttime early morning symptom . It think sustain bronchodilation lung deflation night may improve respiratory mechanic , diaphragmatic function , pulmonary gas exchange , sleep quality , reduce severity morning symptom . This study first explore effect nighttime dose aclidinium/formoterol combination therapy detail measurement respiratory mechanic early morning symptom COPD . This study also give u good understand mechanism early morning respiratory symptom improvement bronchodilator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This randomize , placebo-controlled crossover study patient receive even dose either aclidinium/formoterol ( ACL/FOR ) placebo steady-state condition twice-daily ACL/FOR establish . Patients continue take dosage inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) prior study entry . Subjects complete 4 visit part study , fifth follow-up visit require ensure return pre-study health status . After initial screen visit ( Visit 1 ) confirm eligibility 1-week run-in period stable triple therapy [ long-acting beta2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid ( LABA/ICS ) + long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) ] , subject complete baseline testing ( Visit 2 ) include : full pulmonary function test , sleep/symptom questionnaire , polysomnography include periodic measurement overnight spirometry ( sit supine ) . Subjects receive 2-week treatment twice-daily ACL/FOR continue ICS baseline run-in . Once stability treatment ACL/FOR ICS establish , two overnight treatment visit ( Visits 3 4 ) , conduct 3-7 day apart allow return normal sleep status . For visit , even dose ACL/FOR versus placebo randomize treatment order . Treatment visit similar visit 2 include overnight measurement respiratory mechanic ( diaphragm electromyography respiratory pressure ) . Short-acting bronchodilator withhold least 8 hour prior visit . SAMPLE SIZE : This exploratory physiological study primary outcome improvement morning pre-dose trough inspiratory capacity ( IC ) 200 ml . A sample size 20 provide least 80 % detect treatment difference base standard deviation ( SD ) approximately 0.2 L response difference trough IC ( vanNoord , 2006 ) , two-tailed test p &lt; 0.05 . The investigator anticipate patient consent instrumentation ; however , investigator hop n=12 respiratory mechanical measurement . Due complexity study measurement , interim analysis conduct 10 subject complete .</detailed_description>
