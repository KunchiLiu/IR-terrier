	<brief_summary>Cancer spread brain , brain metastasis , difficult treat . Meclofenamate drug show reduce brain metastasis growth laboratory . This medicine use past treat pain . But , study , use prevent new brain metastasis . This first time meclofenamate use patient brain metastasis . This pilot study mean purpose study determine large clinical trial meclofenamate possible patient brain metastasis . This study also aim find effect , good and/or bad meclofenamate patient cancer spread brain . The investigator also want learn potential effect drug may digestive system .</brief_summary>
