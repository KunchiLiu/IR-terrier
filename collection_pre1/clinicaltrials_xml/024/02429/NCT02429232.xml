	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus common disease much impact human 's health relate osteoporosis . But mechanism remain unclear . The foreign research reveal thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) would increase risk osteoporosis bone fracture , especially elderly woman . However , still controversial term youth men . In Taiwan , relate study analyze relationship TZD osteoporosis . This multicenter randomize control study.This study recruit adult ( age ³40 year ) type 2 diabetes patient metformin ( ³1500mg/day ) currently recent HbA1c 7.0~8.5 % .Patient history macular edema , congestive heart failure ( NYHA Fc III , IV ) , chronic renal failure ( stage IV , V ) , AST ALT 2.5 time upper limit , Medical history endocrinopathies , osteoporosis bone fracture , cancer exclude . Current bone fracture undergo treatment , pregnancy , breast feeder also exclude . This 3-year project enroll 160 eligible volunteer randomize group A B ( 80 ) . During next 48 week group A B receive metformin+pioglitazone metformin+linagliptin respectively . Blood sugar , renal , liver function examine every 12 week . Calcium , phosphorus , vitamin D level , bone turnover marker ( N-terminal propeptide type 1 procollagen , bone-specific alkaline phosphatase , osteocalcin , serum C- telopeptide , type 5 tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , pyridinoline deoxypyridinoline crosslinks ) check 6 month . All blood sample send one core laboratory center . The within-group difference examine repeated-measure ANOVA . The between-group difference examine Student 's test .</detailed_description>
