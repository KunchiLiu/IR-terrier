	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess result ovarian tissue freezing , resumption initiation menses ( menstruation : discharge blood tissue uterus happen every 4 week female pregnant ) pregnancy , prior start chemotherapy radiation treatment ( commonly use cancer treatment condition multiple sclerosis , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis ) . Females undergo chemotherapy radiation therapy cancer medical condition may stop menses may able produce biological child . Girls achieve puberty expose chemotherapy ( alkylating agent ) radiation treatment , risk 22-50 % . In contrast , girl older 10 year , achieve puberty , experience acute ovarian failure 50 % case . By freeze preserve ovarian tissue help prevent outcomes . In fact , consider cured disease , another surgical procedure ovarian tissue transplant back . This surgery increase possibility resuming/initiating menses chance pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present time , freeze ovarian tissue consider experimental thaw future use tissue initiate pregnancy must perform part research program . With patient 's permission , portion ovarian tissue freeze use portion donate research pool . Twenty subjects/year participate study . Participation study last patient 's ovarian tissue use , patient decides drop study , rest life . Freezing ovarian tissue do research . Thawing future use tissue start pregnancy must do part research program . After age 18 , patient decide institution wish use tissue future , purpose become pregnant . The number visit decide surgical procedure perform . The Investigators contact patient phone , email , mail turn 18 year old , use tissue drop study ( whichever come first ) follow patient 's medical fertility status time ask question future use frozen tissue possible result treatment . Depending patient 's age time enrollment , follow-up might 30 year . PURPOSE Primary objective : To assess resumption/initiation menses surgical ovarian preservation ( ovarian tissue explant follow freeze autologous transplantation ) . Secondary objective : To assess pre- post-treatment production various hormone , i.e. , anti-mullerian hormone ( AMH ) , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , inhibin-B , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , estradiol , serum histological measurement . Tertiary objective : To assess long-term sexual development , fertility competence , lifespan ovarian preservation via surgical autotransplant . RATIONALE Chemotherapy treatment alkylating agent and/or total body irradiation prevent normal pubertal development uterus , ovary , breast primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) . Explant autologous transplantation ovarian tissue prevent ovarian insufficiency allow normal sexual development puberty fertility competence . RESEARCH DESIGN Prospective cohort study . STUDY PROCEDURES Subject Recruitment Screening- Subjects recruit referral St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) Methodist-Le Bonheur physician Reproductive Medicine clinic hold Dr. Laura Detti . Patients undergo informed consent process accordance St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) Methodist-Le Bonheur Institutional Review Boards . Screening Visit- Complete medical history physical exam ; vital sign , height , weight . Psychological Consult impact therapy . Laboratory testing- Lab result Estradiol , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , Anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH ) , Inhibin B , obtain patient ' clinical chart . In addition , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( 12-lead ) ; Bone age scan ( pre-pubertal ) , Pelvic ultrasound ( transabdominal transvaginal , depend patient 's age ) obtain patient ' clinical chart . If pelvic ultrasound obtain prior surgery , procedure perform anesthesia prior patient undergo surgery ovarian tissue harvest ) . Surgical Procedures- Unilateral oophorectomy perform laparoscopy prior undergoing chemo-radiation treatment specify . Subsequent ovarian cortex autotransplant perform laparoscopy patient declare cured physician . Laparoscopic procedures- Upon general anesthesia induce , attention turn patient 's abdomen 3-4 0.5 cm skin incision perform ( one umbilical fold 2 lateral incision ; possibly , 4th suprapubic incision ) . Disposable , bladed , trocars insert abdominal cavity . The ovary identify unilateral oophorectomy perform retroperitoneal clamping/dissection infundibulo-pelvic utero-ovarian ligament . A bipolar electrode use assure accurate hemostasis irrigation perform need . Upon retrieval trocars abdomen , skin incision reapproximated 4-0 vycril suture . The second laparoscopic procedure do perform autologous ovarian tissue transplant suture thaw cortex fragment recipient ovary use 7-0 Prolene ( Ethicon , Johnson Johnson , USA ) , use technique describe Silber et al . ( Silber et al. , 2005 ; Silber Gosden , 2007 ) apply laparotomy transplantation . As transplanted tissue exhaust function 1st autologous transplant , laparoscopic procedure might become necessary year transplant rest cryopreserved tissue tissue available cryobank storage . Freezing Procedure- The process vitrification start Operating Room lab within 120 minute collection sample complete University Tennessee Center Reproductive Medicine laboratory . The tissue subdivide numerous vial individual storage/thawing . This allow selective thawing autotransplant multiple procedure , necessary . Embryology laboratory procedures- The ovarian tissue store patient use autologous transplant . However , technique perform embryology laboratory may available patient near future might represent best option fertility preservation patient blood-borne cancer ( i.e . : leukemia ) , risk re-seeding cancer cell tissue transplant high . Follow-Up Evaluation- Study treatment include post-operative visit follow schedule follow-up visit patient ' initial disease complete physical exam psychological evaluation conduct , laboratory testing obtain follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , anti-mullerian hormone ( AMH ) , Inhibin B . Visits schedule one month explant every 6-12 month autotransplant tissue afterwards . Laboratory testing , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( 12-lead ) , Bone age , Pelvic ultrasound may repeat yearly , part patient 's schedule follow-up . Bone age assessment stop bone age 18 year achieve . Patients go develop ovarian insufficiency prior puberty undergo estrogen/progesterone therapy per institutional protocol . Follow-up continue patient stay enrol study reach 40 year age , go menopause , desire , tissue transplantation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pre postpubertal patient diagnosed condition necessitate chemo radiotherapy wish preserve ovarian function . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients acute chronic condition would preclude surgery . These include , limited , hyper hypocoagulation disorder , lung condition preclude mechanical ventilation , brain death . 2 . Patients primary oncologist and/or pathologist discourage enter protocol specific condition characteristic . These include , limited , cancer high risk ovarian metastasis leukemia nonHodgkin lymphoma . 3 . Patients know positive bone marrow leukemia solid tumor . 4 . Patients whose tumor organ communicate peritoneum peritoneal sample time primary excision show evidence disease . 5 . Patients older 40 year age . 6 . Males .</criteria>
