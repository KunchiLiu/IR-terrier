	<detailed_description>Background rationale Residual physical disability common follow discharge stroke rehabilitation service . A third first-time stroke survivor remain physically disabled five year stroke , equivalent 300,000 people UK . Stroke service traditionally `` front load '' provision tail month stroke . However , people stroke report variety unmet long-term need sense abandon NHS service . The UK National Stroke Strategy recommend stroke regard Long Term Condition continue support provide need . This include community-based rehabilitation , emphasis personalisation , re-ablement self-management consequence stroke . There good evidence exercise promote functional recovery , enhance adjustment coping , improve psychological wellbeing , reduce risk recurrence . Hence stroke guideline recommend people stroke regularly engage specific form exercise , however many meet recommendation . Various personal environmental factor may account : stroke-related impairment , lack confidence knowledge regard exercise benefit , inadequate provision support programme facility . In response , community-based programme offer . However , programme often focus fitness rather function , give little attention self-management sustain behaviour ( ensure benefit maintain structured programme end ) . National stroke guideline recommend intervention address functional improvement self-management strategy even though recently update Cochrane review note gap evidence regard intervention . An approach call ARNI ( Action Rehabilitation Neurological Injury ) attempt address concern ; create specifically people stroke acquire brain injury wish continue functional recovery.ARNI rigidly-defined programme set principle strategy tailor individual circumstance context . It lead registered exercise professional additionally train accredited ARNI institute ( http : //www.arni.uk.com ) . In UK , NHS , Local Authorities organisation use ARNI trainer provide community-based training stroke survivor . Our survey training include Northeast England , Lancashire , Luton Bedfordshire , Milton Keynes , Hillingdon Cornwall . The survey find training positively receive stroke survivor , family clinician vary content delivery . Reports benefit broadcaster Andrew Marr also increase public awareness ARNI . However evidence ARNI remain largely anecdotal , may work select approach difficult replicate . There need detailed cohesive specification ARNI could rigorously evaluate replicate . Furthermore stroke survivor participate Institution 's research question generation process ask ARNI work yet randomise control trial ( RCTs ) intervention . Thus follow Medical Research Council 's framework development evaluation complex intervention undertake five link preliminary study : 1 ) survey current ARNI provision UK ; 2 ) comparison ARNI approach relevant stroke practice guideline , 3 ) before-and-after study group-based 4 ) one-to-one train 5 ) focus group conduct participant . From work design programme call ReTrain ( Rehabilitation Training ) base core ARNI principle inform best practice guideline stroke . Before undertake large definitive RCT ReTrain pilot study need address issue feasibility acceptability . Purpose study ReTrain aim improve ( ) functional mobility , ( ii ) adherence national guideline post-stroke exercise level , ( iii ) health-related quality life , people stroke discharged clinical rehabilitation . A definitive RCT require assess clinical cost effectiveness ReTrain intervention . The purpose pilot study assess feasibility trial evaluate trial procedure inform design definitive trial .</detailed_description>
