	<brief_summary>About 45 million people Bangladesh chronically expose unacceptable level arsenic drinking water . Chronic arsenic poisoning lead cancer , vascular disease . This dietary trial intend test potential high-selenium lentil , consume lentil soup , reduce arsenic body burden expose Bangladeshi population , improve overall health status . Arsenic-exposed family assign one two group . One group eat lentil ( 50g/person/day ) naturally high selenium , group receive lentil low selenium content . This 6 month trial randomize double-blinded .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic arsenic ( As ) poison worldwide public health problem . Up 100 million people worldwide , chronically expose dangerously high concentration As drinking water food supply . Bangladesh face major public health challenge - contamination groundwater arsenic ( As ) . Since tube well water contamination As discover Bangladesh 1990s , As drinking water reduce 40 % , yet approximately 45 million Bangladeshis remain risk high As concentration great WHO guideline value 10 µg/L well water . The annual cost treat As related health problem Bangladesh currently estimate $ 77.5 million . Micronutrient-deficient ( e.g . Selenium ) soil lead less nutritious local food , become partner crime exacerbate toxic burden incur As exposure . Selenium ( Se ) trace element essential component several metabolic pathway control immune function . Se As work antagonistically body compete many biological function . Arsenic add animal diet know counteract Se toxicity/activity animal since 1930s . Se interacts As form complex ; excessive Se excretion occur result Se/As complex formation condition chronic As ingestion low dietary Se ingestion . This scenario may accelerate Se depletion . Again , since Se form complex As , Se supplementation , principle , reduce As toxicity also decrease effect As exposure many parameter , oxidative stress , immunotoxicity etc . Supplementation Se pills currently use treat arsenicosis . But pill often well received people expensive low-income family . Lentils common food Bangladesh country already import lentil Canada . Saskatchewan ( SK ) grown lentil rich Se , mostly form L-selenomethionine , highly bioavailable . The Saskatchewan lentil mean selenium level 425-672 µg/kg , region lentil selenium level go 1884 µg/kg . These high Se lentil , incorporate daily meal As-exposed Bangladeshi family , may help mitigate symptom long-term As poison cost-effective , uncomplicated , nutritionally beneficial way . Red lentils trial grown Saskatchewan , Canada ( Se = 854 µg/kg ) Idaho , USA ( Se = 0.043 µg/kg ) . Other nutrient measure crop lentils UofS dispatch family Bangladesh . High-Se low-Se lentil pack two different colour packet give designated family . The investigator well field staff blind type lentils/dahl give family . 65g lentil per person/day measure cup female family head , typically cook moshur dahl ( lentil soup ) daily whole family . 65g high-Se lentil provide 55 µg Se , recommend daily allowance 55 µg/person/day . Sampling procedure Data collection : At start , mid-term end trial ( Table 1 ) , household water sample , plus hair , blood , faeces on-spot urine sample collect individual . Water ( 20 ml ) : Currently use drinking water measurement arsenic , toxic essential element . Water acidify storage pH &lt; 2.0 trace element free tube room temperature . Urine ( 15-20 ml ) : Urine collect trace element free tube , aliquoted stored -80°C . Stool ( 5-10 g ) : Stool collect trace element free tube store -20°C . Blood ( 5 ml/visit ) : Blood collect use sterile needle syringe trace element free vacutainer tube . Blood sample send Dhaka Lab day cool box separate plasma cell , aliquot plasma store -80°C . Buffycoat cell store RNALater -80°C freezer . Whole blood ( 100 ul ) store -80°C . Hair : Hair back head collect ( 0.2 g ) analysis As , hair As suitable marker long term exposure . Laboratory Methods : Metals : Se measure blood Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry ( GFAAS ) . Arsenic hair , stool urine sample measure Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry ( HGAAS ) acid digestion sample . Oxidative stress antioxidant status : investigator measure 8-oxo-7 , 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) , major product ROS-induced oxidative stress , urine/plasma child use commercial ELISA kit . Reduced glutathione ( GSH ) consider important scavenger reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , ratio oxidize glutathione ( GSSG ) use marker oxidative stress . The antioxidant status ( GSH/GSSG ) whole blood assess measure GSH GSSG use commercial kit . Lung inflammation : The investigator measure fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) participant ( ≥9 yrs ) marker allergic lung inflammation . Monitoring FENO simple non-invasive use hand hold small equipment . FENO measure online single breath technique accord publish guideline ( ref ) manufacturer 's instruction , NIOX MINO® . FENO record mean value two successive reproducible readout . FENO data give p.p.b . NIOX MINO use IR communication transfer participant data PC use software NIOX MINO Data Manager . FENO usually high individual current allergic asthma rhinitis .</detailed_description>
