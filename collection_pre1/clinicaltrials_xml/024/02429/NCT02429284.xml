	<detailed_description>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) subset pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) characterize obstruction pulmonary artery fibrotic material vascular remodel lead increase pulmonary arterial pressure right ventricular failure . A United States CTEPH Registry establish guidance Steering Committee consist recognize physician scientist expertise CTEPH related disease . The mission Registry promote great understanding prevalence , pathophysiology , evaluation , treatment patient CTEPH share information , education , collaborative investigation among PH center excellence throughout U.S . The development national CTEPH registry important element advancement understand CTEPH improvement care patient suffer debilitate disease . All consecutive consenting patient recently diagnose ( &lt; 6 month ) CTEPH participate study site enrol . At time study entry , data prior history evaluation obtain patient interview review medical record . Patients follow biannually enrollment conclusion study ( minimum 1 year follow-up final patient enrol ) . Much data gather Registry present descriptive statistic . The Registry seek assistance biostatistician develop statistical plan within patient patient cohort analysis . Approximately 750 patient newly diagnose ( &lt; 6 month ) CTEPH enrol . TIME FRAME : Participants follow time enrollment 1 year final patient enrol . Short term outcome measure medical history collect initial visit , clinical data collect initial clinic visit , hospital say , procedure ( applicable ) . Patients follow every 6 month enrollment long term outcome measure quality life , functional status , medical treatment . DATA ANALYSES : Demographics Clinical Course : Demographics , risk factor , time appropriate test diagnosis , PAH target medication use , functional status , hemodynamics time enrollment provide annually aggregate data investigator . Evaluating Outcomes PTE Surgery : Descriptive statistic peri-operative data collect provided aggregate data investigator annually . Immediate post-operative longitudinal follow-up patient undergo PTE surgery also provide aggregate data annually site . Comparisons hemodynamics , functional status , medication supplemental oxygen use healthcare utilization make pre-operative data longitudinal post-operative data . Evaluating Predictors Successful PTE : Using longitudinal data collect post-operative PTE patient , definition `` successful PTE '' establish base upon hemodynamics , functional status QoL . Retrospective analysis pre- , peri- , post-operative data analyze identify factor predict `` successful '' `` unsuccessful '' PTE surgery . Evaluating Outcomes Nonsurgical Therapy CTEPH : Predominantly descriptive statistic use describe patient operative candidate nonsurgical therapy ( medication , balloon pulmonary angioplasty ) use treatment . Changes hemodynamics , functional status , QoL healthcare utilization therapy provide aggregate data annually . Evolving Research Needs : To adapt evolve science research need CTEPH community , separate analysis plan develop new objective identify minor change eCRF may occur response new diagnostics treatment , approve Steering Committee . Ongoing assessment enrollment data capture also perform Steering Committee certain goal Registry meet . COMMITTEES : A Steering Committee , chair Dr. Kim Kerr , comprise think leader area cardiology , pulmonology , cardiothoracic surgery expertise CTEPH . The committee follow responsibility : - Provide advice guidance U.S. CTEPH Registry study design protocol - Provide advice guidance variable capture eCRF - Provide guidance study sit selection - Review data result provide insights interpretation data annually - Provide input plan organization abstract manuscripts - Review abstract paper submission scientific journal conference - Present data conference An Adjudication Committee , consist physician expertise diagnosis CTEPH , review patient felt Investigators eligible Registry . The adjudication committee member must confirm diagnosis CTEPH subject enrol Registry .</detailed_description>
