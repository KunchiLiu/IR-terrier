	<brief_summary>In general population , xerosis often cause external factor seasonal change . In case , best way relieve dry skin use standard moisturizer . However , suffer mobility problem due age paralysis ( e.g. , spinal cord injury , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's , etc ) , xerosis often severe chronic multiple cause ( endogenous rather exogenous one ) underlie mobility impairment-related skin problem . This study double-blind , randomize study positive control ( active comparator ) ass safety efficacy SQIN CanSATs ( Co-Activation Natural Synergistically Acting Target-receptorS ) technology dry skin patient suffer paralysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Xerosis medical term dry skin . When result skin scaly itchy , condition call pruritus . This occur natural moisture drawn skin . The skin need moisture protect . The best way relieve dry skin normally , suffer seasonal dry skin problem , use standard moisturizers . However , suffer mobility problem due age paralysis ( spinal cord injury , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's , Alzheimer 's , muscular dystrophy , amputation , cerebral palsy , comparable disorder ) , xerosis become severe chronic multiple cause ( endogenous metabolic problem dysfunction rather exogenous one ) . SQIN CanSATs technology design act upon multiple mechanism enhance protect , moisturize , repair effect . Based upon preliminary evidence , SQIN CanSATs technology thus elicit significantly superior effect compare standard , commercially available moisturizers .</detailed_description>
