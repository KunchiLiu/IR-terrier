	<detailed_description>Dyslexia specific learn difficulty mainly affect development literacy language related skill . It characterize difficulty phonological processing , rapid naming , work memory , process speed automatic development skill may match individual 's cognitive ability . Phonological processing deficit well establish one main cause dyslexia . Working memory ( WM ) today consider cognitive system strongly relate person 's ability think learn . Over last decade increase body evidence indicate WM deficit may cause particular problem individual dyslexia . This consistent many every day problem report dyslexics around . WM deficits frequent child read deficit . A major question whether WM impairment secondary phonological core deficit affect phonological loop , cause additional deficit involve central executive . Exploratory finding fMRI study indicate impaired WM process dyslexia unique neuronal signature may associate central executive process . However conflict finding study need . The child study , diagnose dyslexia , divide two subgroup ( 16/16 child ) . They randomly allocate either adaptive training group treatment usual control group baseline assessment . Both group meet baseline test re-testing 4 week complete training . Those serve non-trained control offer participate training completion study . The intervention study aim increase WM child dyslexia . We hypothesise intensive computerized work memory training improve reading fluency , speed comprehension child dyslexia .</detailed_description>
