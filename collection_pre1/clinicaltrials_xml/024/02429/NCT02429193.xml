	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer Able read understand consent form , either alone aid translator Surgically medically castrate , testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL ( &lt; 2.0 nmol/L ) . If patient treat luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( patient undergone orchiectomy ) , must remain continuous androgen suppression therapy throughout study Patients receive bonetargeted therapy must stable dos least 4 week prior enrollment Historical frozen/paraffinembedded diagnostic tissue specimens available analysis ( i.e . radical prostatectomy biopsy tissue ) Documented metastatic disease positive bone scan metastatic lesion ( CT MRI ) biopsied anticipated minimum 4 core , assess local radiologist prostate cancer progression study entry define one follow criterion : . Rising PSA : minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination ii . Soft tissue disease progression , define RECIST 1.1 iii . Bone disease progression , define PCWG2 two new lesion bone scan PSA value screen visit ≥ 2 µg/L ( 2 ng/mL ) ECOG performance status 02 Adequate organ BM function , define follow criterion : i. absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/µL ii . platelet ≥100,000/µL iii . total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) iv .
