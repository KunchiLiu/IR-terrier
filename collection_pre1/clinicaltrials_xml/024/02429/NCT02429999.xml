	<brief_summary>Infertility health problem infertile couple really ill . However , narrow interpretation problem refute world community . The WHO define health `` state complete physical , mental social wellbeing merely absence disease infirmity '' . It also argue overpopulation main problem develop country help infertile couple contradicts interest country world large . However , narrow approach contradicts human right general reproductive right particular . In 1994 , United Nations International Conference Population Development Cairo mention issue future action 'prevention appropriate treatment infertility feasible ' . However , guideline concrete action programme give develop country . Worldwide , 80 million couple suffer infertility ; majority population resident develop country . In September 2001 , meet 'Medical , Ethical Social Aspects Assisted Reproduction ' organize WHO . For first time , major attention pay ongoing development assist reproduction technology together social ethical implication develop country . It first time WHO highlight issue assist reproduction develop country . ART develop country highly expensive one step ovulation induction common protocol induction long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist pituitary suppression regimen combine relatively high dos exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) remain frequently use stimulation protocol expensive . study use mild ovarian stimulate protocol letrozole adjuvant gonadotrophin less expensive The use aromatase inhibitor recently introduce infertility treatment , especially ovulation induction . An aromatase inhibitor block conversion androgens estrogens ovarian follicle , peripheral tissue , brain . This result two thing : ( ) Fall circulate local estrogen ( b ) Rise intraovarian androgen . Fall estrogen level , release hypothalamopituitary axis negative feedback estrogen . Thus , surge follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) release , result follicular growth . Since , feedback mechanism intact ; normal follicular growth , selection dominant follicle , atresia small grow follicle occur ; thereby facilitate monofollicular growth ovulation.Another mechanism action aromatase inhibitor increase intraovarian androgen . This increase follicular sensitivity FSH . Recent data show role androgens early follicular development . augment FSH receptor stimulate insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I ; FSH IGF-I act synergistically promote follicular growth . This pharmacodynamics letrozole ensures improve endometrial thickness , cervical mucus , monofollicular , good folliculogenesis . So , factor may lead high pregnancy rate great likelihood singleton pregnancy . Letrozole try ovarian stimulation assist reproduction . With concept mild stimulation IVF improve implantation rate , letrozole potential agent . Letrozole two potential us IVF : First , use follicular phase usually FSH/human menopausal gonadotropin ( HMG ) ovulation induction ; second , also use luteal phase stimulate IVF cycle reduce circulate E2 level ; thus , potentially reduce ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) risk . A significant reduction total dose gonadotrophin find aromatase inhibitor add controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) cycle . Some study evaluate addition letrozole patient normal ovarian response undergo IVF Intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . They show high implantation ongoing pregnancy rate letrozole cotreatment group .</brief_summary>
