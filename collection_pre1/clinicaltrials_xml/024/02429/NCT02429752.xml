	<brief_summary>The goal study identify significant prevalence abnormal respiratory pattern sample patient low back pain ( LBP ) , presence abnormal respiratory pattern predictive rehabilitation outcome population . In addition , investigator assess response inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) subgroup subject maintain abnormal breathing pattern 1 month physical therapy . Patients seek physical therapy LBP within Uhealth system recruit . The first phase study observational . A comprehensive assessment respiratory function perform begin therapy 1 month therapy . Subjects demonstrate abnormal respiratory pattern 1 month therapy offer opportunity participate second phase study receive 1 month inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) . The respiratory assessment repeat end IMT training program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose first stage study assess association prognostic value respiratory variable low back pain presentation outcomes standard physical therapy care . Thus , prospective longitudinal cohort , observational repeat measure ( pre post test ) , design use portion study . Both treat physical therapist patient blind finding respiratory assessment order minimize risk treatment bias . Further , physical therapy plan care intervention administer therapist ' discretion standardize . Typically multimodal treatment approach use LBP , include : patient education , therapeutic exercise improve strength , flexibility , motor control deficit , manual therapy decrease pain improve joint soft tissue mobility , physical agent pain management . By allow therapist use clinical judgment , maintain real world environment improve generalizability result . Although introduce variability may confound result , evidence single treatment approach superior address LBP patient . Thus , allow therapist use clinical reasoning subgroup treat accordingly maintain standard practice patient care . A sample convenience , consist 75 consecutive subject seek physical therapy low back pain , select . These subject measure initiation physical therapy program retested 1 month later , use procedure describe . Subjects unresolved BPD 's time reassessment offer opportunity receive 1 month inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) , second phase study . Subjects complete IMT retested follow protocol end IMT program . All subject recruitment data collection occur UM facility , faculty Nova Southeastern University involve data analysis . Thus , IRB approval obtain University Miami reliance agreement Nova Southeastern University . It anticipate data collection last 6/2015-6/2016 . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subject recruitment Patients seek physical therapy LBP University Miami contact phone within 1 week initial examination . They inform purpose study study protocol . If express interest participating , schedule separate 90 minute session Kendall clinic initial data collect . In addition , poster ( see appendix 6 ) place wait room 5 outpatient physical therapy clinic ( Kendall , University Miami Hospital , Bascom Palmer , Pain Center CRB , Plantation ) , own operated University Miami , recruitment tool well . Qualifying patient facility may call additional information request inclusion study well . Measurement protocol Resting Baseline Data First subject interview collect data condition status , well screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . ( see Appendix 1 data collection sheet ) . The subject ask complete 3 questionnaire : Pain Catastrophizing Scale , Modified Oswestry Disability Index , Nijmegen Questionnaire ( Appendix 2 , 3 , 4 respectively ) . These questionnaire take less 5 minute complete . Prior begin physical data collection , subject inform immediately stop activity cause significant discomfort increase symptom test session . Then , subject ask breath forcefully Micro MPM ( Micro Medical Ltd , Chatham , UK ) device order collect MEP . This repeat 3-5 time 1 minute rest trial . They ask place TIRE device mouth breathe forcefully sustain breath long possible order collect MIP SMIP data . This process also repeat 3-5 time . Finally , subject fit Cosmed K4b2 Respitrace system ; device describe detail later . The k4b2 consist rubber mask light nylon vest measure breath breath gas analysis , Respitrace consist merely 2 soft chest strap measure heart rate variability chest excursion breathing . The subject lie supine position 5 minute , sit quietly 5 minute , stand quietly 5 minute order gather baseline data position . The first 2 minute position use accommodation period data record . Thus data analysis consist data final 3 minute position . Postural Challenge baseline data Subjects seat stable chair , foot ground without back support , ask perform 3 round resist shoulder flexion resist hip flexion extremity . A submaximal resistance apply manually investigator hold 30 second follow 30 second rest . After , ask lift hold 25 lb weight 30 second 3 time , follow 30 second rest trial . Then lift weight 10 time repetitively faster paced rhythmic fashion set metronome . They rest seat position 5 minute measure recovery heart rate respiration . Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) Subjects demonstrate unresolved BPD 's upon reassessment PT treatment , option participate second phase study . These subject schedule twice week receive IMT use RT2 device software program ( describe detail later ) . The IMT protocol use biofeedback train specific percentage MIP SMIP inspiratory effort . The program consist 6 breath per level , 6 level , ability alter rest time breath subject advance level . The training session complete subject fails achieve select percentage SMIP twice consecutively , complete 6 level maximum 36 breath . The IMT program set 60 % subject MIP/SMIP breathe workload focus full deep inhalation use diaphragmatic breathing follow slow prolonged exhalation subsequent inhalation signal RT2 software prompt ( via visual display computer screen ) `` Please Inhale '' . The first level IMT consist 40 second rest period breath follow 30 20 second rest period IMT level 2 3 , respectively . The rest period IMT remain three level remain 20 second subject prompt prolonged exhalation throughout much 20 second rest period possible . The training session also stop subject complains increase back pain dizziness , fatigue , adverse response note . Post IMT Data Collection After 4 week , 8 session IMT , data collection protocol repeat .</detailed_description>
