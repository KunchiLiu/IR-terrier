	<brief_summary>The purpose study research effect ketamine brain function patient Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . This study ancillary MRI neuroimaging study conduct patient MDD enrol separate clinical trial . Healthy control volunteer also enrol . No drug intervention give part protocol per se . To study brain activity related emotion , study team use technology call functional MRI ( fMRI ) , method evaluate flow blood brain use powerful magnet . fMRI involve exposure radiation . Patients show sample image computer screen design bring emotional reaction . The MRI machine take number picture head . By computer analysis , machine able create picture brain 's activity . There several task scan involve look various image represent different emotion , study team monitor brain activity task . Patients scan 24 hour receive ketamine ( part separate study ) analyze treatment effect . These scan compare depressed patient receive ketamine , well healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To characterize function basic neural system involve emotion perception regulation TRD . - Experiment 1.1 : Neural response emotional face TRD ( neutral , low high intensity sad facial expression ) . Hypothesis 1.1 : Patients TRD , relative HC participant , evidence increase activation amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus sad compare neutral face . - Experiment 1.2 : Neural response negative emotion regulation TRD ( cognitive reappraisal ) . - Hypothesis 1.2 : Patients TRD , relative HC participant , show enhance activation amygdala generation negative affect impaired ability recruit PFC/ACC region attempt down-regulate negative affect . Specific Aim 2 : To characterize change emotion-processing neural network associate ketamine rapid antidepressant response . - Experiment 2.1 : Neural change response emotional face associate ketamine rapid antidepressant response . Hypothesis 2.1a : Ketamine , compare midazolam , associate reduced activation amygdala sad compare neutral face . 2.1b : Antidepressant response , compare non-response , specifically associate change PFC/ACC function . - Experiment 2.2 : Neural change negative emotion regulation ( cognitive reappraisal ) associate ketamine rapid antidepressant response . - Hypothesis 2.2a : Ketamine , compare midazolam , associate reduced activation amygdala negative emotion generation enhance PFC/ACC function down-regulation negative affect . 2.2b : Antidepressant response , compare non-response , specifically associate enhancement PFC/ACC function . Specific Aim 3 ( Exploratory ) : To investigate functional effective connectivity emotion perception/generation neural system cognitive emotional regulation system . Hypothesis 3 : TRD compare HC characterize abnormal connectivity PFC/ACC amygdala , normalize rapid antidepressant response . The set research MSSM . All research participant recruit screened Mood Anxiety Disorders Program ( MAP ) ( Director : Dan V. Iosifescu , M.D . ) MSSM . MAP one major clinical research program Department Psychiatry , research funding NIH , Department Defense , NARSAD , industry .</detailed_description>
