	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect chronic HCV infection correspond innate immune activation immune response HBV vaccination . We recruit chronic HCV patient healthy control patient HBV vaccination . We use RNA Sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) , relatively new technology simultaneously measure expression gene , determine patient ' innate immune status , learn innate immune signature relate HBV vaccine response . We explore mechanisms chronic HCV infection affect different immune cell function know important effective HBV vaccine response . These study enhance understand immune effect chronic viral infection , establish factor determine effective vaccine response , help guide vaccination strategy HCV patient individual chronic inflammatory disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vaccines responsible prevent million death extend average human lifespan . Effective vaccine stimulate cell immune system activate gene associate function bring protective immunity . If good understand factor influence vaccine success versus failure , may able improve current vaccine and/or develop new vaccine prevalent infectious disease . Certain group people respond well particular vaccine . For example , vaccine less effective immunocompromised patient , elderly individual , people chronic inflammatory disease . Often group people greatest need protection infectious disease . People chronically infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) increase risk serious liver disease . As result , receive hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) vaccine , protect infection HBV , another virus target liver . However , people chronically infect HCV respond HBV vaccine effectively healthy people without HCV . Chronic HCV infection thought cause general problem immune system , reason poor vaccine response poorly understood . Previous work show chronic HCV infection lead production chemical ( `` innate immune '' ) signal affect function immune system , currently unknown might impact vaccination .</detailed_description>
