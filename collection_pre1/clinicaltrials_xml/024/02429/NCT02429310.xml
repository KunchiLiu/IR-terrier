	<brief_title>Adjuvant Benefit NMES Supervised Exercise Patients With IC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The circulation blood around body dependent effective pump heart . Patients claudication experience pain discomfort legs usually activity walking , go away rest . Claudication symptom peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . If leave untreated , patient develop arterial insufficiency lead various complication swell , painful leg , reduce heal injury loss limb extreme condition . PAD define narrow artery reduce blood flow . It commonly due atherosclerosis , association heart disease , stroke , diabetes . Its incidence estimate 7-14 % general population , increase age 20 % over-seventies . It associate effect mobility , skin condition quality life . Symptoms include pain legs walking ( intermittent claudication ) , pain rest ( particularly night ) , gangrene , limb loss . Management PAD base encouraging exercise , modification risk factor smoke , high blood pressure , high cholesterol diabetes . In patient PAD , exercise tolerance often limited . Severe symptoms disease treat procedure balloon angioplasty , stenting surgical bypass , procedures risk . There also remain percentage patient suitable revascularisation , option besides amputation available . Current NICE guideline ( NICE Clinical Guideline 147 : Lower Limb Peripheral Arterial Disease : Diagnosis Management guidance.nice.org.uk/cg147 ) advise supervise exercise programme offer patient IC well best medical therapy . Regular exercise show significantly improve symptom IC patient , effect benefit quickly revert upon inactivity . Some trial show increase blood flow legs time use medical device ( intermittent pneumatic compression , muscle stimulators ) , addition maximal medical surgical therapy , increase claudication distance , absolute walk distance , decrease rest pain , reduce amputation rate . In unit become apparent increase number medical device available circulatory support , either use inpatient , out-patient , member general public . The support evidence variable scientific clinical content relevance , require clinical trial evaluate . The device use study activate pump action leg muscle provide neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) cause foot muscle contraction relaxation . This squeeze blood back towards heart , improve circulation . The investigator wish evaluate whether NMES use device beneficial effect patient claudication use conjunction supervise exercise .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients intermittent claudication follow eligible study : All ethnic group , male female age 18 year . Diagnosis intermittent claudication Be nonchildbearing potential ; OR use adequate contraception negative urine pregnancy test result within 24 hour , appropriate , use study device . Blood pressure currently moderate control ( &lt; 160/100mmHg ) No current foot ulceration Patients meeting follow criterion exclude : Has unstable condition ( eg , psychiatric disorder , recent history substance abuse ) otherwise think unreliable incapable comply study protocol . Has renal failure Has diabetes Has anklebrachial pressure index ( ABPI ) &gt; 0.9 Has metal implant Pregnant Has cardiac pacemaker defibrillator device Has recent low limb injury lower back pain Has current foot ulceration skin ulcer Has foot deformity Has disorder , opinion Investigator , might interfere conduct study .</criteria>
