	<brief_summary>Dyspnea report symptom patient advance Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) undertreated . Morphine effective treatment dyspnea recommend clinical practice guideline , question concern benefit concern respiratory adverse effect remain . For example , effect health-related quality life functional capacity unknown . In one-third patient oral sustain release morphine ( morphine SR ) n't relieve dyspnea remain unknown whether severity descriptor breathlessness may predict response morphine . Finally , cost-effectiveness morphine SR patient group unknown . Therefore , prescription morphine patient COPD limit . Objectives double blind randomize control trial study effect oral administration morphine SR health-related quality life , respiratory adverse effect , functional capacity ; explore whether description severity breathlessness relate clinically relevant response morphine analyse cost-effectiveness morphine SR . The study population consist 124 clinically stable outpatient COPD severe dyspnea despite optimal pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morphine Treatment Dyspnea Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants outpatient confirm diagnosis COPD , suffer severe dyspnea despite optimal pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment . Participants recruit CIRO , center pulmonary rehabilitation Netherlands complete pulmonary rehabilitation program . After provide informed consent , patient randomize . Members research team perform measurement blind treatment allocation . Patients intervention group receive regular clinical care morphine SR 10mg , administer twice daily ( 20mg/24h ) , increase one two week three time per day 10mg ( 30mg/24h ) non-responders . Patients define non-responders mean dyspnea numeric rating scale ( NRS ) score reduce 1 point comparison baseline . The control group receive regular clinical care placebo medication . Patients receive morphine placebo four week . In addition , group receive prescription laxative metoclopramide start intervention instruct adjust dose need . When intervention period end , participant choose continue morphine treatment . They follow twelve week assess healthcare use , use morphine number adverse effect exacerbation . Measurements baseline include : demographic , medical history , medication , co-morbidities , exercise capacity , respiratory parameter , generic disease-specific health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) , severity dyspnea , sensory affective dimension dyspnea , impact dyspnea , cognition , level daytime sleepiness , functional capacity . A member research team visit patient 1 2 week home environment assess adverse effect , compliance , exacerbation , disease-specific HRQoL , mobility , severity dyspnea , respiratory parameter . A member research team call patient 2 day 3 week assess adverse effect , compliance , exacerbation , severity dyspnea . After 4 week follow measurement perform : respiratory parameter , exercise capacity , general disease-specific HRQoL , sensory affective dimension dyspnea , impact dyspnea , functional capacity , adverse effect . Overnight oximetry perform home environment baseline four week . A diary cost healthcare use fill four week . Measurements twelve week follow intervention include : retrospective cost questionnaire , generic disease-specific quality life severity dyspnea adverse effect . Statistical analysis Baseline characteristic compare intervention control group use descriptive statistic . Chi square test use categorical variable . Independent sample T-tests Mann-Whitney U-tests use continuous variable , accord variable distribution . Change CAT-score , respiratory parameter 6MWD baseline four week compare patient intervention control group . First , mean change CAT-score , respiratory parameter 6MWD compare two group use independent sample T-test Mann-Whitney U test , accord variable distribution . Afterwards , multivariate analysis longitudinal data perform . Analyses do use intention-to-treat approach . The relationship response opioids severity dyspnea descriptor breathlessness explore use univariate analysis , follow binary logistic regression model . A trial-based economic evaluation perform , base empirical data obtain RCT . The economic evaluation perform societal healthcare perspective , first include cost inside outside health care sector , follow publish international guideline . The time horizon trial-based economic evaluation four week . The outcome twelve week follow intervention use model-based economic evaluation . The model probably take form Markov model ; however decide upon study .</detailed_description>
