	<brief_title>Study LEE011plus Cetuximab Patients With Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In mammalian cell cycle , entry S phase achieve cyclin-dependent kinase 4 6 ( CDK4/6 ) , activate family E2F transcription factor phosphorylating deactivate retinoblastoma protein ( pRb ) . LEE011 orally , highly selective small molecule inhibitor CDK4/6 potently induce G1 arrest sub-micromolar IC50 's variety pRb-positive cancer cell . A recent study show inhibitor CDK4-CCND1 complex show promising result SCCHN pre-clinical model . There strong rationale investigate CDK inhibitor disease . In phase Ib/II study single agent , major toxicity observe Grade 3 4 fatigue ( 53.8 % ) , nausea ( 50.8 % ) , neutropenia ( 47.7 % ) , anemia ( 37.1 % ) , leukopenia ( 46.2 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 34.1 % ) , diarrhea ( 32.6 % ) , vomit ( 34.8 % ) , lymphocytes count decrease ( 30.3 % ) , anorexia ( 21.2 % ) , hyperglycemia ( 21.2 % ) , constipation ( 19.7 % ) , hypoalbuminemia ( 18.9 % ) , dyspnea ( 18.2 % ) cough ( 16.7 % ) .</detailed_description>
