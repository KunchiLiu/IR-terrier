	<brief_summary>At King Khalid University hospital approximately 1200-1500 MRI do yearly pediatric neonatal patient . The investigating hospital one pioneer provide service Kingdom ( establish 10 year ago ) patient age group . Only small percentage pediatric patient age 8 year accept procedure do without anesthesia ; majority MRI procedures do general anesthesia . The airway management patient commonly accomplish laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) . LMA practice anesthesia since early 1980s . Pediatric neonatal patient ( include ex-premature ) also benefit use LMA . There many advantage LMA endotracheal tube ( ETT ) pediatric patient like ease insertion , secure airway rapidly , avoidance muscle relaxant , reduce incidence sore throat , post-operative hoarseness coughing time extubation , great hemodynamic intra ocular pressure ( IOP ) stability . There different type pediatric LMAs available e.g . I-gel , ProSeal , LMA supreme , LMA classic , LMA unique , LarySeal Ambu . These device differ morphologically ( silicone , polyvinyl chloride soft gel ) . Out variety LMAs MRI compatible ( produce artifact MRI image ) , example Ambu LMA I-gel LMA King Khalid University Hospital ( investigate hospital ) two type use . On search literature investigator find one study adult comparison make study compare different LMAs basis spatial effect anatomical structure neck airway pediatric patient age 12 year . In prospective randomized study , investigator compare spatial relationship I-gel Trademark ( TM ) Ambu® AuraOnce ( AO ) TM pediatric airway pediatric patient undergo 3-D MRI general anesthesia ( GA ) .</brief_summary>
