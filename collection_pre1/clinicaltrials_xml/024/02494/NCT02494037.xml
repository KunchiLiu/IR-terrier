'' The survival outcome consecutively recruit advanced stage breast , colorectal , pancreatic , ovarian cancer patient treat multiple naturopathic oncology clinic North America track compare outcomes publish current medical literature SEER ( Surveillance , Epidemiology End Results ) order address fundamentally important question whether AIO beneficial impact survival . Involvement total seven active AIO clinic Canada US allow recruitment sufficient sample size address question well provide outcomes generalizable AIO across North America .</detailed_description>
