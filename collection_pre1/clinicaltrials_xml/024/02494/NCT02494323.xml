	<brief_summary>Seventy ( 70 ) subject put Ness L300 System , FES device ankle dorsiflexion patient foot drop . Stimulation give two different electrode : QFE single channel stimulation , Segmented Electrode dual channel electrode . The purpose dual channel stimulation enable balance dorsiflexion , inversion/eversion inclination . Ankle elevation record seat position gait . Subject preference record BSW Questionnaire Subjective Survey . Twenty first subject stimulate four different dual channel configuration . The configuration show advantage others continue evaluate fifty additional subject . Same procedure take place , addition ambulation test perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Dual Channel v . Single Channel FES Dropfoot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty subject stimulate single channel electrode , Quick Fit Electrode . The value stimulation record , well ankle movement ( balanced Dorsiflexion , invert everted Dorsiflexion ) . Subjects fill Benefit , Satisfaction , Willingness continue ( BSW ) form . Next , subject fit segmented Electrode enable single dual channel . Four configuration current compare sit position gait . The first configuration ( A ) segment electrode single channel stimulation , second configuration ( B ) two current run parallel . The first medial channel stimulate deep branch common peroneal nerve ( dorsiflexion/inversion ) second lateral current stimulates superficial peroneal nerve ( eversion ) . In third configuration ( C ) , channel run diagonally . The medial channel run upper medial electrode lateral low electrode ( dorsiflexion/inversion ) . The lateral channel run lateral upper electrode medial low electrode ( eversion ) . The forth configuration ( D ) include common low electrode ; connect upper medial electrode function medial channel ( dorsiflexion/inversion ) ; connect upper lateral electrode , function lateral channel ( dorsiflexion/eversion ) . The subject ask answer 3 question try configuration . 1 . Thinking current system use , test system provide difference way stimulation feel compare exist system ? Yes No/ Can tell difference . 2 . Thinking current system use , test system provide difference think 'quality ' stimulation use compare exist system ? Yes No/ Can tell difference . 3 . Thinking current system use , test system provide difference ability walk compare exist system ? Yes No/ Can tell difference After three dual channel configuration test , subject ask Question 4 : Thinking last three test system use today , test system believe best among three ? B , C D Subjects ask grade satisfaction one dual channel system believe best use Benefit , Satisfaction , Willingness Continue ( BSW ) questionnaire . After complete evaluation first twenty subject , re-evaluation ten subject take place . The anode/cathode electrode re-positioned cathode locate upper part cuff anode locate low part cuff . This re-evaluation need , since first evaluation inconsistency anode/cathode position right left FES cuff . Stimulation give sit 2 minute walk . Ankle movement stimulation intensity record compare input receive initial evaluation ten subject . Fifty additional subject recruit evaluate performence common anode configuration ( configuration D ) compare QFE . configuration D chosen show advantage dual channel configuration . Same procedure take place order compare performance Segmented Electrode ( configuration D ) QFE . In addition , ambulation test perform : 2mwt 10 meter walk test . Gait velocity achieve use electrode compare also compare gait velocity achieve walking stimulation .</detailed_description>
