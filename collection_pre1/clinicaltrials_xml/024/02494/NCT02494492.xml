	<brief_title>Treatment Bilateral Severe Uveitis IVT Regulator T-cells : Study Tolerance Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arsenal limitation treatment uveitis Uveitis major cause severe visual loss even blindness child young adult . In almost one third case , associate infectious agent , another third integrated field autoimmune diseases systemic entity include ( Behçet 's disease , sarcoidosis , spondyloarthropathy ... ) limit eye ( Birdshot type retinochoroidopathy , sympathetic ophthalmia , idiopathic retinal vasculitis ) . The last third remains idiopathic , despite careful etiological research , cause identify . The systemic corticosteroid often effective significant side effect patient compliance often poor . That sometimes administer directly posterior segment eye ( vitreous ) , effect temporary , often ineffective , also associate side effect . In addition , steroid-dependent , require treatment immunosuppressive agent ; also may responsible many adverse effect always effective . In therapeutic impasse situation , investigator propose cell therapy approach injection CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 regulator + ( Tregs ) , directly vitreous patient . A new therapy approach uveitis cell therapy It clearly establish Tregs play critical role control autoimmune disease . In man mouse , deep deficit Tregs associate severe autoimmune syndrome , lead death .In uveitis , also show Tregs control disease deficient mouse . Tregs report human . In addition , group others show various autoimmune disease prevent transfer Tregs mouse .Thus , cell therapy injection Tregs raise hop treatment chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease . However , specific polyclonal Tregs , strong therapeutic potential administer systemically . The Tregs use clinic polyclonal Tregs purify magnetic bead , adsorb anti- CD25 antibody . This technology provide cell preparation enrich Tregs 50 70 % , balance consist effector T cell ( Teffs ) , B lymphocytes NK cell . A therapeutic alternative systemic injection specific Tregs inject , preactivated polyclonal Tregs directly target site autoimmune disease , purify clinical grade condition . Description study population . Patients bilateral severe steroid-dependent non-infectious uveitis . Infectious tumoral etiology exclude completion comprehensive review system . All patient negative Quantiferon test normal Mantoux test . Biological test send specialized laboratory eliminate active infection . In case , aqueous humor obtain AC tap / vitreous biopsy obtain vitrectomy analyzed diagnostic assay IL-10 , immune load factor PCR analysis ( toxoplasmosis , herpes virus ) . Pathophysiology uveitis human . Inflammatory chemokines cytokine , IL-6 , IFN-g , IL-8 MCP-1 sometimes IL-1ß , IL-2 TNF-alpha find aqueous humor vitreous patient uveitis . Given small volume available human sample ( around 100 ml ) , data obtain multiple detection technique use flow cytometry , measure concentration thirty different cytokine chemokines 50 microl volume . In order expand study cytokine chemokines , investigator also use semi-quantitative technique name `` '' antibody array '' '' allow analysis number different molecule range 30 170 . These preliminary result , evaluated patient , confirm presence Th1 inflammatory profile eye patient suffer uveitis ( show ) confirm strategy Risks associate injected cell . No side effect Tregs injection observe preclinical mouse model . In Biotherapies facility , production Tregs , provide essay , contain 50 70 % Tregs , define phenotype CD4 + Foxp3 + CD25 + . Therefore investigator test effect leukocyte contaminant therapeutic effect uveitis mouse . The presence contaminant effector T cell , B cell , NK cell , dendritic cell macrophage cause visible side effect clinical histological level . A second potential risk inject polyclonal Tregs differentiate different celltype . Anterior study show natural human Tregs differentiate Th17 type T lymphocytes presence IL-2 IL-15 . This differentiation accentuate addition IL-1ß , IL-6 , IL-21 IL-23 . Although investigator formally exclude possibility Tregs inject IVT may differentiate Th17 cell , since event probably detect uveitis eye ( data show ) . Another potential risk dissemination inject cell eye due reflux conjunctiva IVT . The last risk consider development non- Hodgkin lymphoma create tolerogenic environment due regulatory T cell . This risk identical one associate current reference treatment uveitis : immunosuppressive agent corticosteroid . These risk never fully describe literature animal human . Dosage number patient . The 3 level Tregs dose respectively 0.4 , 1.2 3.6 million . The low dose 0.4 million Tregs correspond 2 time effective dose mouse . Two 18 patient enrolled trial . Funding provide 12 patient . Good clinical practice ( GCP ) The research conduct accordance GCP current legislative regulation . Investigators certify research conduct accordance protocol GCP The Biotherapies facility perform production activity , quality control accord current regulation cell therapy compliance good practice Cellular Therapy ( BPTC ) also accord standard operating procedure ( SOP ) . Specific authorization require ANSM realization essay To conclude , clearly establish cell therapy approach CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 regulator ( Tregs ) play critical role control autoimmune disease human mouse clinical test . Therefore clinical trial assess effect Tolerance- dose patient treat Tregs bilateral severe steroid-dependent non-infectious uveitis .</detailed_description>
