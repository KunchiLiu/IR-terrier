	<brief_title>Increasing Physical Activity Stroke Survivors Using STARFISH , Interactive Mobile Phone App</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke one common disable condition worldwide . The various physical impairment arise stroke may encourage physically inactive lifestyle ( Michael et al . 2005 ) . Ninety percent stroke survivor functional disability reduce mobility major impairment ( Gresham et al . 1975 ) . Stroke survivor generally spend less time physically active time sedentary age-matched healthy counterpart ( Alzahrani et al . 2011 ; Michael Macko 2007 ; Rand et al . 2010 ) Physical inactivity follow stroke associate decreased muscle strength cardiovascular fitness , decrease ability perform activity daily live heighten risk recurrent stroke cardiovascular disease ( Ivey et al . 2005 ) . Cardiovascular disease lead cause death chronic stroke . Inactivity low cardiovascular fitness two modifiable risk factor associate cardiovascular disease . Activities promote mobility fitness therefore vital prevention cardiovascular event . The previous Chest , Heart Stroke , Scotland ( CHSS ) fund pilot study demonstrate community dwell stroke survivor significantly less physically active spend significantly time sedentary compare healthy , matched control . ( Paul et al . 2015 ) . The investigator also report use STARFISH smartphone app ( describe ) six week positive effect physical activity These pilot result support development fully power , randomise control trial . Starfish description Research team member develop STARFISH , smartphone app , aim encourage user become physically active . The sensor within standard smartphone record number step take per day individual . STARFISH undertaken group four facilitate social support group member receives personalise daily step count target . Each person represent coloured fish , participant see group member ' fish fish tank smartphone . When participant walking , fish swim blow bubble , participant progress towards daily step count target , fish 's fin tail grow . When group member reach target five day week , group reward another sea creature appear fish tank ( e.g . seahorse ) . Aims Objectives The primary objective study : To compare objectively measured physical activity community dwell stroke survivor undertaken four month physical activity intervention use STARFISH application control group receive four month usual care . The secondary objective : 1 . To compare objectively measure sedentary time , activity profile , walk endurance , walk speed , activity daily live ( ADL ) , fatigue , anxiety depression , quality life metabolic health-risk biomarkers community dwell stroke survivor undertaken four month physical activity intervention use STARFISH application control group receive four month usual care . 2 . To determine effect STARFISH intervention evident two month completion intervention . Design Methods The design single blind , parallel randomise control trial ( RCT ) . An assessor , blind group allocation perform outcome measure . Methods Participants Using pilot study data investigator estimate RCT need 58 subject group detect , 80 % power 30 % increase step count , intervention control group , 5 % level significance . Therefore allow drop , 128 people fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion , give write informed consent recruit study . Participants recruit number route : - Chest Heart &amp; Stroke ( CHSS ) affiliate group West Scotland - NHS Lanarkshire stroke liaison nurse identify appropriate patient stroke audit system Lifestyle Group . - NHS Ayrshire Arran physiotherapists stroke liaison nurse - NHS GG &amp; C Community Stroke Team Participants identify one route describe give Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) , clinician CHSS group co-ordinator . In NHS Lanarkshire potential participant identify database send letter PIS Lead Stroke Clinician . Those interested take part study ask contact researcher use contact detail PIS . Following discussion researcher willing take part invite attend Glasgow Royal Infirmary ( GRI ) clinical research facility , NHS Lanarkshire clinical research facility NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran clinical research facility . At initial visit participant meet researcher assessor . In order keep assessor blind group allocation researcher assessor see participant separately different room . Participants see researcher first , opportunity ask question , agree take part study ask sign consent form . Consent also seek contact participant 's GPs inform participation research study . For participant recruit CHSS group GPs agreement seek participation study . All participant inform free withdraw study time . Those provide informed consent direct assessor undergo baseline measure . All baseline measure make prior group allocation , Participants direct see researcher randomise one group . The patient recruit group 8 . For randomisation process list random number generate use Excel spreadsheet . Each number print placed identical , opaque envelope , even number represent Intervention group odd number Control group . Participants give consecutive envelope recruit two group 4 participant form randomisation stage . The Intervention Group : The intervention four month physical activity intervention use STARFISH app aim increase participant 's number step baseline value . Participants allocate intervention group give mobile phone ask carry phone seven day establish normal level physical activity ( PA ) . They work group four ( explain ) participant individualised step count target . The initial step count target create add 10 % mean number step per day record phone . At end week , step count review data server . If participant reach step count target least five day week , target increase remotely 5 % follow week , maximum increase 3000 step baseline ( Fitzsimons et al . 2008 ) . Where participant fail reach step count target , remain unchanged follow week . Participants notified step count target change via message display smartphone screen . Each intervention group meet , group four participant , seven day baseline assessment . At visit researcher explain STARFISH app provide participant instruction manual refer need . Initial step count target calculate ( describe ) , agree participant set . The Intervention group meet researcher 2 month later discuss progress , ask question raise concern . The researcher meet intervention group end programme , second assessment ( 4 month ) collect smartphones . At visit focus group , STARFISH group four participant , undertake explore participant ' view acceptability usability STARFISH app . During intervention period participant give contact number researcher call experience problem . The Control Group : Participants allocate control group give booklet general advice physical activity . All participant send lay summary study end . Outcome measure take baseline , 4 month ( end intervention , primary end point ) 6 month ( two month intervention ) . Descriptive statistic use summarise variable time point . Group differences interaction effect variable assessed use two-factor repeat measure ANOVA model Greehosue-Geisser correction factor . Model assumption check required appropriate transformation use . Where significant Time effect find Tukey 's post hoc test use . Effect size report estimate observed power . All analysis perform IBM SPSS v22 level significance set 5 % .</detailed_description>
