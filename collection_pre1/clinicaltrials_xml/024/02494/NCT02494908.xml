	<brief_summary>As see previous study Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) MRI able detect subtle change brain tissue even short timescale hour result perform cognitive task learning , We wish explore compare change patient idiopathic PD ( IPD ) see change learn process detect use widely available noninvasive technique MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evidence Neuroplasticity After Performing Cognitive Task Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : utilize high sensitivity DTI MRI methodology explore evidence subtle microstructural brain alteration perform cognitive task compare change patient PD healthy control age . PD patient control undergo full cranial MRI scan depiction anatomy structural abnormality ( scan duration ~40 min ) . Immediately afterwards subject play car race computer game ( Need Speed ) 90 minute . Following game , patient undergo additional DTI MRI scan ( ~15 minute ) .</detailed_description>
