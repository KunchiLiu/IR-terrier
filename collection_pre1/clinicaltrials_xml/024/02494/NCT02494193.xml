	<brief_summary>In deep carious lesion , present risk pulp exposition , treatment option partial caries removal carious tissue follow provisional restoration , approach call indirect pulp capping . The aim double-blinding control randomized clinical trial evaluate success indirect pulp cap use resin-modified glass ionomer , additional layer calcium hydroxide use control . The sample 112 molar and/or premolar ( n=56 ) , present deep carious lesion , patient age 15 30 year treat dental clinic Department Dentistry Federal University Sergipe . The select carious lesion must reach 2/3 dentin , observe bite-wing radiography , without pulp involve and/or factor compromise evaluation . After detailed anamnesis , select teeth radiographed e carious tissue surround wall remove . At floor cavity , carious tissue partially remove use hand dentin excavator , remain caries-affected dentin avoid pulp exposition . The removed carious tissue floor cavity evaluate presence Lactobacilos e Estreptococos Mutans , remain dentin evaluated consistency , colour humidity . Randomly , cavity provisionally restore : Control - dress cement calcium hydroxide follow resin-modified glass ionomer ; Experimental - resin-modified glass ionomer . The distance base restoration pulp cavity cap measure bitw-wing radiography . The patient re-evaluated 15 day , teeth compromise pulp vitality exclude study . The remain patient evaluate 6 month . The distance base restoration pulp cavity cap measure , follow provisional restoration removal . The remain caries-affected dentin floor cavity fully remove bacteriological evaluation perform . The consistency , colour humidity tissue evaluate . Finally , permanent restoration perform .</brief_summary>
