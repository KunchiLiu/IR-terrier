	<brief_title>Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Pancreatic Cystic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical Impact Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Cystic Pancreatic Lesions ( CINE-Cyst ) Background The diagnostic evaluation cystic pancreatic lesion represent difficult problem clinical decision making , due increase incidental discovery lesion cross-sectional imaging ( compute tomography magnetic resonance ) . Prevalence cystic pancreatic lesion estimate 2 20 % adult population ( 1-3 ) , autopsy study show prevalence increase age ( 4 ) . The WHO classification ( revised 2010 ) report several category , serous cystadenoma ( SCA ) , mucinous cystic neoplasm ( MCN ) , intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) pseudopapillary neoplasm represent 90 % ( 5 ) . Several lesion progress cystadenocarcinoma ( notable exception SCA ) , hence differential diagnosis extremely important clinical decision currently involve either image follow-up ( usually base EUS magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) referral surgery final pathological diagnosis establish resection . Nevertheless , considerable overlap image characteristic benign , premalignant malignant pancreatic cyst lead unclear clinical management algorithm . Several international guideline address diagnosis management cystic pancreatic lesion ( 6-8 ) . The comprehensive guideline report clinical decision algorithm include clinical imaging criterion , like pancreatitis / jaundice cyst size &gt; 3 cm , thicken / enhance cyst wall , main pancreatic duct ( MPD ) size 5-9 mm , non-enhancing mural nodule abrupt change caliber pancreatic duct distal pancreatic atrophy [ 8 ] . If clinical / image characteristic present EUS consider mandatory assess definite mural nodule , main duct feature suspicious involvement , well perform EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytopathology exam order exclude malignancy . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) represent highly valuable tool management patient focal pancreatic mass , either solid cystic . As minimally invasive technique enable high-resolution image pancreatic parenchyma surround structure consider method choice detection clinically suspect pancreatic lesion , negative predictive value close 100 % [ 9 ] . Its diagnostic sensitivity show previous study superior compare image technique , especially case small tumor [ 10 , 11 ] . After detection cystic pancreatic lesion , certain morphological feature allow discrimination specific type [ 12 ] : - pseudocysts - parenchymal change , without septation nodule - serous cystadenomas - multiple microcysts honeycomb appearance - mucinous cystadenoma - thicken septation wall , calcification - intrapapillary mucinous neoplasia ( IPMN ) - communication MPD There n't universally accepted morphological parameter predict either type risk malignancy EUS [ 8 ] . `` Worrisome feature '' image include cyst size ( 3 cm ) , thicken cyst wall , MPD size 5-9 mm , non-enhanced mural nodule , abrupt change MPD caliber distal pancreatic atrophy , lymphadenopathy . `` High risk stigma '' include obstructive jaundice cystic pancreatic head mass , enhance solid component MPD size 10 mm , thus warrant indication surgery , clinically feasible . Generally , cysts `` worrisome feature '' cyst 3 cm , without worrisome feature , undergo EUS , cysts `` high-risk stigma '' undergo surgical resection [ 8 ] . Additionally , EUS enable guide fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) currently recommend first-line procedure whenever pathological diagnosis require [ 13 ] . However , EUS-FNA sampling technique drawback , mainly represent relatively low negative predictive value diagnose pancreatic cancer . It thus reliably rule diagnosis malignancy patient high clinical suspicion usually need repeat FNA [ 14 ] . The role EUS-FNA differential diagnosis focal cystic lesion still controversial , CEA amylase level well cytology often useful differentiate various lesion , [ 8 ] . Thus , SCA low level CEA amylase . For CEA , value 192-200 ng/ml 80 % diagnostic accuracy mucinous cyst [ 15 ] . Likewise , amylase level might increase IPMN MCN , make differential diagnosis difficult [ 16 ] . Cytology limited sensitivity , aspirate yield low number cell , useful detects atypical epithelial cell highly predict malignancy , 80 % accuracy [ 17 ] . Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) emerge recent year novel technique actually enable vivo microscopic analysis ongoing endoscopy . Endomicroscopy perform either dedicate ( eCLE ) miniprobe-based system ( pCLE ) [ 18 ] . It contrast base technique , widely use agent intravenously administer fluorescein [ 19 ] . The probe-based endomicroscopy system consist flexible catheter probe represent bundle optical fiber link micro-objective , laser scan unit control acquisition software ( Cellvizio ; Mauna Kea Technology , Paris , France ) . The flexible confocal miniprobes specifically design pass work channel standard endoscope , biliary catheter cholangioscopes thus pCLE system easily integrate endoscopy unit . The principle technique base laser beam define wavelength focus towards target tissue recapture signal displayed 'optical biopsy ' single horizontal plane . The potential role CLE explore pathology upper low gastrointestinal tract , show good accuracy predict final histopathological diagnosis base immediate evaluation tissue vascular pattern [ 20 ] . Recently CLE go beyond superficial luminal indication development new microprobe , i.e . flexible probe thin enough pass 19-gauge needle . Thus EUS guidance solid organ access real-time microscopic information . nCLE image abdominal organ far achieve animal model [ 21 , 22 ] . The feasibility technique also prove clinical study [ 23 ] descriptive criterion diagnosis pancreatic cystic neoplasm develop multicentre trial [ 24 ] . However , clinical impact nCLE decision make algorithms cystic pancreatic neoplasm yet describe . The hypothesis EUS-nCLE could allow target tissue sample cystic pancreatic neoplasm result accurate diagnosis . With validation technique real-time pathological diagnosis could obtain immediate initiation adequate therapy single investigation . Aim The aim propose study describe clinical impact nCLE clinical decision management algorithm base EUS , EUS-FNA and/or EUS-CLE image criterion cystic pancreatic neoplasm , evaluate also feasibility safety nCLE examination . Imaging test All patient suspicion ( clinical , US , CT/MRI ) cystic pancreatic lesion evaluate EUS , EUS-FNA EUS-nCLE compare final pathological diagnosis . - For EUS examination linear instrument use perform complete examination pancreas . - Lesion characteristic ( echogenicity , echostructure , size , wall , mural nodule , septation , etc . ) describe . - The presence regional lymph node report maximal size , echogenicity , shape margin . - Identification liver metastasis also look upon . - EUS-nCLE perform EUS identification cystic pancreatic lesion / lymph node / liver metastasis : - The confocal microprobe preloaded 19G FNA needle previously describe [ 13 ] advance lesion EUS guidance . - nCLE examination follow intravenous administration contrast agent ( 2.5 ml fluorescein 10 % ) . - Image data store digitally offline analysis ( least 2 suggestive image 2 suggestive movie 10 second , ) . - EUS-FNA performed image acquisition cytology smear cell block enable final pathological diagnosis . CEA , CA19-9 amylase level measure aspirate . Molecular analysis like KRAS GNAS perform , available . - nCLE image analyze examination principal investigator , clinical procedural information mind . In second step offline analysis , correlation representative CLE image classical hematoxylin eosin section identify .</detailed_description>
