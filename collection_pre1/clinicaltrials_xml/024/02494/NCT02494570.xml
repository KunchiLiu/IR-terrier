A patient eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : 1 . Patients lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) exclude . 2 . Known active uncontrolled symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . A patient control asymptomatic CNS metastasis may participate study . As , patient must complete prior treatment CNS metastases ≥28 day ( include radiotherapy and/or surgery ) prior start treatment study receive chronic corticosteroid therapy CNS metastasis . 3 . Active gastrointestinal bleeding , transfusion dependent . 4 . Preexisting thyroid abnormality allow provide thyroid function control medication . 5 . Uncontrolled serious medical psychiatric illness .
