	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study Evaluate ConforMIS iTotal® ( CR ) Knee Replacement System Versus Off-the-Shelf Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize one two study arm 1:1 ratio implant either iTotal CR off-the-shelf cruciate retain total knee . Sites perform off-the-shelf total knee patient specific instrumentation ( PSI ) conventional instrumentation . At site use PSI , mock CT perform subject pre-operatively . The mock CT ensure subject remain blinded randomization arm . Mock CT involve usual CT protocol perform trained radiologist technician ; however , radiation deliver . Mock CT perform primarily site outside US , PSI less frequently utilize .</detailed_description>
