	<brief_summary>This study men locally-advanced prostate cancer eligible undergo prostatectomy . Standard treatment prostatectomy alone , chance cancer may spread organ future , even prostate remove . If occur , standard treatment would androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ; hormone therapy block testosterone ) plus chemotherapy . Clinical trial suggest neoadjuvant treatment ( treatment give primary therapy ) may prevent recurrence . The purpose research study assess safety benefit ADT plus chemotherapy give prostate removal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm study neoadjuvant ADT chemotherapy subject non-metastatic , locally-advanced prostate cancer eligible radical prostatectomy . Patients treat 4 monthly injection degarelix along two 8-week cycle chemotherapy . Each cycle chemotherapy consist 6 week chemotherapy 2 week rest . In absence toxicity disease progression , patient receive 2 cycle treatment prior radical prostatectomy . The primary endpoint complete near-complete pathologic response . Safety assess patient receive least one dose study drug report adverse event , vital sign assessment finding physical exam routine safety laboratory determination . The severity adverse event certain abnormal laboratory finding assess accord NCI CTCAE V4.03 . Laboratory-based study evaluate follow : - Complete metabolic profile BUN , creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , ALT/AST , total bilirubin , LDH , calcium , albumin , glucose , magnesium , uric acid , phosphorous - Electrolytes Sodium , potassium , chloride , CO2 content - Hematology - CBC differential , platelet count - PT , INR , PTT - Testosterone - Biomarkers - PSA - CTCs</detailed_description>
