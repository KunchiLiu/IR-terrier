	<brief_summary>Currently , adjuvant study hepatic arterial infusion adjuvant setting open . Recently , result phase II study ( NCT00268463 , NSABP-C-09 ) assess potential benefit systemic oxaliplatin capecitabine alternate HAI FUDR , resection CRLM report . The primary end point 2-year survival . Fifty-five 76 eligible patient able initiate protocol-directed therapy complete median six cycle ( range , one six ) . Three postoperative treatment-related death report . Overall , 88 % evaluable patient alive 2 year . With median followup 4.8 year , total 30 patient disease recurrence , 11 involve liver . Median disease-free survival 32.7 month . In conclusion alternate HAI FUDR systemic capecitabine oxaliplatin meet prespecified end point high 85 % survival 2 year clinically tolerable .</brief_summary>
