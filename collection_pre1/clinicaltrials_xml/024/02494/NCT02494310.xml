	<detailed_description>A new mobile diagnostic treatment unit develop BCH address loss-to follow-up associate mobile screen program demonstrate POC diagnosis HRME . The mobile diagnostic treatment unit equip tool infrastructure necessary perform HRME , VIA , colposcopy , biopsy treatment cryotherapy . A team colposcopist , nurse , nursing assistant , driver staff mobile diagnostic treatment unit . The unit travel offer follow-up diagnostic treatment service woman screen positive prior visit mobile screen unit . The mobile diagnostic treatment unit construct maintained BCH . The study include 200 woman abnormal Pap test identify BCH 's exist mobile screen program . Participants randomize cluster receive follow care either new mobile diagnostic treatment unit ( experimental arm ) recall BCH ( standard care ) . We use cluster randomization avoid contamination arm woman get mobile unit service may concern get less service could get BCH woman refer BCH may resent convenience mobile unit . Because area visit mobile unit geographically isolate , anticipate patient cross study arm . VIA perform 5 % acetic acid apply cervix abnormal lesion note . Standard colposcopy perform abnormal lesion note . Proflavine ( 0.01 % ) apply topically . Lugol 's solution apply colposcopy perform abnormal lesion note . Proflavine ( 0.01 % reapplied . HRME image acquire area abnormal VIA and/or colposcopy . In addition , 4 quadrant probed HRME ( 4Q HRME ) ensure non-acetowhite lesion also locate . The provider note impression lesion HRME image site ( normal , benign , low-grade precancer , high grade precancer cancer ) . The entire HRME imaging procedure add less 10 minute standard colposcopy exam . VIA , colposcopy HRME observation record quadrant . Any abnormal area VIA and/or colposcopy biopsied . If abnormal area note , one cervical biopsy obtain normal appear area HRME image area obtain . Two expert pathologist , blind study result , review histology classify either normal , CIN1 , CIN2 , CIN3 , AIS cancer , accord standard criterion ; discrepant result resolve consensus review . TREATMENT : Women randomize mobile diagnostic treatment unit HSIL Pap and/or lesion note VIA and/or colposcopy undergo immediate treatment cryotherapy follow biopsy , provide lesion meet follow criterion : 1 ) cover &lt; 75 % ectocervix ; 2 ) fully cover cryotherapy tip ; 3 ) extend endocervical canal . If colposcopic finding concern invasive cancer lesion amenable treatment cryotherapy , patient refer immediately BCH additional evaluation treatment per standard care . Women biopsy show CIN2+ undergo cryotherapy due negative VIA/colposcopy , recall BCH immediately LEEP ( CIN2/3 ) . Women biopsy show CIN2/3 underwent cryotherapy recall BCH mobile unit 6-month follow-up visit . If persistent recurrent disease note , refer BCH treatment . Women biopsy show cancer adenocarcinoma situ ( AIS ) recall BCH immediately cold knife cone ( CKC ) evaluation treatment per standard care regardless whether cryotherapy perform . Women CIN1 less return follow-up mobile unit BCH follow-up 12 month . Women randomize return central facility follow care undergo VIA , colposcopy , HRME biopsies describe . Patients find CIN2+ treat per standard care BCH .</detailed_description>
