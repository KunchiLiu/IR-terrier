	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial patient metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . The objective phase Ib portion study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 IV q21 day ) prednisone ( 5mg orally BID ) combination ribociclib escalate oral daily dose patient metastatic CRPC prior resistance abiraterone and/or enzalutamide undergone prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . Up three cohort enrol determine MTD DLT profile combination Phase 1b . Dose escalation follow standard 3+3 design . The dosing schedule choose allow patient expose efficacious dose schedule docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 every 3 week ) . If excess toxicity observe treatment combination first dose level ( dose level I ) , alternative dose schema may pursue weekly docetaxel treatment ( 35 mg/m2 weekly ) , demonstrated activity mCRPC decrease risk cytopenia compare every 3 week dosing schedule . The Phase II portion ( N = 29 ) study single arm , two stage , open-label study ribociclib ( dosed RP2D ) combination docetaxel prednisone determine efficacy define safety treatment combination . Patients treated combination ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone 9 cycle . If evidence radiographic clinical disease progression 9 cycle protocol therapy , patient may continue single agent maintenance ribociclib time disease progression . Patients option start maintenance ribociclib 6 cycle docetaxel stable disease well re-staging scan . The dose ribociclib use maintenance dose immediately precede cessation docetaxel treatment .</brief_summary>
