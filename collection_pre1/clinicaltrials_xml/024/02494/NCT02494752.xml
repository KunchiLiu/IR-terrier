	<detailed_description>Contour deformity face require soft tissue augmentation often result condition congenital disorder , acquire disease , traumatic developmental deformity . Significant contour deformity face cause functional well aesthetic problem patient . Conventionally , problem treat allogenic filler , major flap surgery fat grafting.1 However ; different problem associate mention treatment option . For example , allogenic filler foreign material pose allergic reaction also rapid absorption site application . Similarly , flap surgery , form pedicled free flap , produce considerable donor site morbidity . In addition , fine- tune impossible flap , tissue transfer form flap may act blob . Autologous fat grafting gain pervasive acceptance management contour deformity face . Fat autologous tissue source consider ideal soft-tissue filler abundant , readily available , inexpensive , host compatible , harvest easily repeatedly.2 Although practice fat graft new safe natural method soft-tissue augmentation , viability reliability transplant fat graft remain poorly study . One major concern lack consistency final clinical outcome , often require multiple fat grafting procedure make expensive . Rate fat absorption may reach 40 % 80 % .However , previously publish data fail produce cohesive algorithm require component successful , consistent durable fat transplantation.3 In order overcome problem associate fat grafting , innovative technique require . The role fat auto-transplantation plastic surgery evolve controversial technique design simple volume augmentation foundation innovative burgeon field regenerative medicine . This base fact adipose tissue contain adipocytes stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) consist multiple cell type circulate blood cell , fibroblast , pericytes , endothelial cell , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) . Adipocytes account 20 percent few total number cell adipose tissue4whereasthere 3 % MSCs SVF adipose tissue.5 Although percentage relatively low , cell type main contributor overall healing process . MSCs derive adipose tissue ( AT-MSCs ) high proliferative potential ability differentiate mesenchymal ( adipose , bone , cartilage ) non-mesenchymal ( neuron like cell ) lineages.6,7,8 AT-MSCs show enhance angiogenesis , decrease apoptosis modify local inflammatory response owe immunosuppressive immunomodulatory properties.9 Therefore , current study design evaluate effect fat graft AT-MSCs together contour deformity face . By combine traditional fat graft AT-MSCs , tissue viability therefore consistency graft survival may improve . In current model investigator propose transfer fat may act natural scaffold temporary filler restore volume immediately AT-MSCs start participate multiple parameter tissue regeneration . This model support `` host replacement theory '' put forward describe fat graft survive transplanted.10 Due problem associate fat graft alone , desirable solve issue use innovate technique . In current study investigator propose novel idea enrichment conventional fat graft ex-vivo expand AT-MSCs enhance viability graft fat reliability final outcome surgery . Recent animal study suggest AT-MSCs expand administration could help preserve graft fat improve outcomes.11 Thus rationale current study compare outcome conventional fat graft stem cell enrich fat graft contour deformity face . If enrichment fat graft AT-MSCs decrease absorption rate , innovative strategy make fat transfer reliable option soft tissue augmentation . This definitely improve final clinical outcome lesser cost reduce donor site morbidity</detailed_description>
