	<brief_summary>Dental restoration ( crown , inlay onlays ) make conventionally CAD/CAM . The current literature weak separate medical result two technique . However , efficiency enable CAD/CAM could , price initial investment , improve service patient reduce time require restoration , possibly low care cost . The aim study compare immediate medical result short-term prosthetic restoration make conventionally CAD/CAM randomize patient , evaluate economic impact organizational aspect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Conventional CAD/CAM Dental Restorations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medico-economic objective study assess organizational innovation patient treat hospital dental substance loss . The intervention study availability information management patient , systematic use . The economic evaluation innovation consist several part : 1 . A costing study seek determine cost compensation dental substance loss conventional technique CAD/CAM per patient ; 2 . Evaluate cost hospital perspective substitute CAD/CAM conventional dental treatment equipment ; 3 . To build cost-effectiveness ratio compare conventional technique CAD/CAM criterion proportion effective restoration obtain . Assess medical medico-technical impact prosthesis availability CAD/CAM : Modifications treatment plan ( indication plastic filling could shift toward CD/CAM restoration ? ) and/or chronology ( order execution phase ) . The patient cohort care hospital Department Dentistry oral rehabilitation . There indication least partial total dental crown restoration either conventional method CAD/CAM ( equipoise ) . Directly assessable element : individual restoration level : Effective restoration time indication effective restoration , quality restoration , number clinical session require , unitary cost restoration patient level : compliance , overall duration treatment , duration restoration phase , number clinical session ( global restoration phase ) , criteria quality life ( OHIP , SF36 ) , treatment cost ( global restoration phase ) hospital level : number patient care per unit time , number restoration , revenue , expense Patients seek dental restoration one study center need least one fix restoration feasible either CAD/CAM conventional mean select first consultation ( exclude emergency consultation ) . Quality life ( QOL ) index record . Two treatment plan create , one use conventional mean another use CAD/CAM mean require ; two plan may differ step order . The last treatment step plan identical randomization point . The treatment plan maintain pre-prosthetic phase treatment , updated case intercurrent event . The patient formally include randomization point , plan select randomization carry . The resource consumption entail prosthetic step record . At end treatment , patient satisfaction QOL index record . An identical record make 6 month end treatment . Further long-term follow-up patient include study plan , object another protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : The patient care hospital department Dentistry oral rehabilitation . The patient dental insurance plan There indication least partial total dental crown , either conventional method CAD/CAM ( equipoise clause ) . It possible follow patient least 6 month ( midterm outcome evaluation beyond immediate outcome ) Assessment patient monitoring ( formal inform consent require French law accept procedure ) Exclusion criterion : mental , linguistic legal impossibility understand protocol consent participation . Followup impossible doubtful Contraindication whatsoever therapeutic implement : bruxism occlusion disorder require treatment ( mechanical stress , ceramic contraindicate ) TMJ disorder ( severe limitation therapeutic option resolution ) know intolerance dental material use study Patients participate another clinical trial may impact orofacial region ( consultation investigator trial require selection inclusion ) . Teeth : Need prosthetic development ( e. g. telescopic mill crown ) . Extensive coronary reconstruction require de novo root anchorage ( postandcore )</criteria>
