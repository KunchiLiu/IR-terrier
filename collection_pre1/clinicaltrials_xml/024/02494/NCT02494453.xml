	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy play integral role breast cancer therapy . Multiple randomized study demonstrate decreased local-regional recurrence rate decrease breast-cancer mortality . However , balance survival benefit potential toxicity treatment . In particular , cardiac effect radiotherapy concern area research past 20 year . From long-term follow patient lymphoma , know radiotherapy lead increase risk myocardial infarction , valvular dysfunction , systolic diastolic function abnormality , heart failure among cancer-survivors . Patients breast cancer receive low dos small volume heart , also excellent long-term survival , crucial study effect low dose radiotherapy . Indeed , recent study suggest effect see within first 5 year treatment , dose threshold . The investigator hypothesize develop image blood biomarkers cardiac exposure , first step identify patient increase risk cardiac effect . These patient target close monitoring early intervention , potentially statins ACE inhibitor . Additionally , characterize time-course radiation dose-volume relationship , potentially real-time modification make RT field design patient sensitive RT effect . Finally , information incorporate well design treatment plan future patient .</detailed_description>
