	<brief_summary>This prospective , double-blinded , randomize control study compare efficacy trans-incisional rectus sheath block laparoscopic guide rectus sheath block pediatric single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC ) . umbilical hernia repair child . Patients age 10-21 year old undergoing SILC cholelithiasis , cholecystitis , biliary dyskinesia screen study inclusion . Eligible patient parents/guardians approach , agreeable , consent study pre-operatively . Patients randomize receive either trans-incisional rectus sheath block intra-operative rectus sheath block direct laparoscopic visualization . Both do attending pediatric surgeon . The patient , patient guardian , select research team member , PACU staff blind method analgesic administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Regional anesthesia increasingly utilized provide post-operative analgesia number surgical procedure child . Rectus sheath block local anesthetic infiltration surgical site two common mode provide post-operative analgesia . Studies compare two mode show ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block improve immediate pain score reduce use post-operative analgesia pediatric patient undergo umbilical hernia repair . However , study compare pre-incisional ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block post-operative local anesthetic infiltration subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection . Also , knowledge , study evaluate use efficacy laparoscopic guide rectus sheath block pediatric single-incision laparoscopic surgery . Single-incision surgery involve perform abdominal operation though single , small incision , usually locate umbilicus . The purpose study compare efficacy trans-incisional rectus sheath block intra-operative infiltration rectus sheath direct laparoscopic visualization via intra-abdominal approach provide post-operative analgesia follow single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC ) child . The investigator propose prospective study pediatric patient undergo single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy randomize pre-operatively receive either trans-incisional rectus sheath block facial closure prior skin closure intra-operative infiltration rectus sheath direct laparoscopic visualization cholecystectomy . The primary outcome post-operative pain rating base Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale ( WBFPRS ) follow SILC . Additional outcome measure include : operative time , use intravenous/oral opioid and/or non-opioid medication post-operative period , duration analgesia follow surgery base time first rescue analgesic , intra-operative hemodynamic change , post-operative hemodynamic change , incidence side-effects , complication . Patients/patient guardian receive sheet document post-operative WBFPRS score , oral opioid non-opioid medication administration discharge home total 5 day .</detailed_description>
