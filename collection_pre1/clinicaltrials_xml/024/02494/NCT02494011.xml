	<brief_summary>This study compare effect close kinetic chain exercise Russian current stimulation pain , functional disability , wrist range motion ( ROM ) grip strength patient colles ' fracture . Forty five patient stable colles ' fracture randomly classify three group fifteen patient group ; Group I receive traditional exercise form ; Mobilization , stretch exercise , range motion exercise ( passive active ) edema control wrist joint . Group II stimulate electrical Russian current addition traditional exercise . Group III receive closed kinetic chain exercise ( wall press , plyometric wall push , Quadruped rhythmic stabilization , Push exercise ) plus traditional exercise . All outcome measure include Pain , function , Wrist ROM , grip strength evaluate treatment program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise Versus Russian Current Stimulation Rehabilitation Colles ' Fracture .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material Methods Patients Forty five patient stable colles ' fracture collect October 6 hospital elsahel hospital treat conservatively close reduction cast removal plaster cast involved study January 2013 May 2013 . All patient assign randomly three group draw lot ; group I ( traditional exercise ) , group II ( Russian stimulation ) group III ( CKC ) . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patient le 20 year old . 2 . Intraarticular fracture involve hand . 3 . Any problem affect shoulder /elbow joint involve side . 4 . Nerve lesion . 5 . Fracture ulna . Intervention Group I receive traditional exercise program form ; 1 . Mobilization : With patient sit high back support chair , gentle traction oscillatory technique ( glide ) thirty second used increase wrist range motion direction frequency two stroke per one second repeat six time session . For progression ten second added frequency mobilization technique session . 2 . Stretching exercise : Wrist flexor ( flexor carpus radialis flexor carpus ulnaris ) , extensor ( extensor carpus radialis longus brevis extensor carpus ulnaris ) , radial deviators ulnar deviators stretch gently within limit pain fifteen twenty second hold end creep movement contractile noncontractile element ( muscle tendon ) . Stretching exercise muscle repeat ten time session . 3 . Passive range motion : The wrist finger move slowly , gently smoothly direction passively available range motion . Passive range motion apply five minute begin five minute end session . 4 . Active range motion : Patient ask perform wrist flexion , extension , radial ulnar deviation well finger flexion , extension abduction actively much possible two set set ten repetition ( i.e . twenty repetition begin session twenty repetition end session ) . 5 . Edema control : hand elevate towel pressure apply volar dorsum hand passive ROM apply examiner firstly patient ask perform flexion extension finger fifteen repetition fifteen second relax three time . Group II receive Russian current stimulation addition traditional exercise : Electrical stimulation carry use phyaction 787 device ( Manufactured Uniphy , serial number 24823 , Netherlands ) . Two equal size carbon rubber electrode place common flexor origin ( medial epicondyle humerus ) distal part flexor carpus radialis flexor carpus ulnaris , perpendicular longitudinal axis forearm fifteen minute time stimulation . The frequency 2.5 kHz , burst duty cycle 50 % intensity adjust accord patient tolerant . The burst duration 10 millisecond 50 Hz . Group III receive closed kinetic chain exercise plus traditional exercise : 1 . Wall press exercise : The patient stand foot shoulder-width apart , arm hold directly front body 90º elevation wall . Feet approximately two three foot ( 0.6-0.9 meter ) away wall . The patient press wall distal extremity fix stable surface ask keep press thirty second . 2 . Plyometric wall push-up exercise : The patient stand away wall two foot arm front body approximately 90o . The chest lowered toward wall elbow bend approximately 45º 60º . The patient forcefully push wall return start position . 3 . Quadruped rhythmic stabilization exercise : Patient hand knee table floor head spine keep neutral position . The examiner instruct patient hold body without movement . Against short , rapid push motion side side , front back , along diagonal . The push motion progress submaximal maximal intensity slow fast . The patient ask preserve balance exercise maintain thirty second , week time increase five second progression . 4 . Push exercise : Quadruped plinth floor . The patient lower body arm elbow bent approximately 45º 60º . The patient push floor return start position . All patient three group apply program 3 time weak . CKC exercise perform ten time week two repetition add progression . The aim study explain informed consent obtain patient . Outcome Measures Pain , functional disability , ROM measurement ( wrist flexion-extension , radial-ulnar deviation ) , grip strength injured hand use outcome measure . Pre-treatment ( baseline ) post- treatment ( six week ) measurement record . Pain functional disability Patient rat wrist evaluation ( PRWE ) questionnaire : The PRWE questionnaire consider subjective outcome measure consist fifteen question answer scale one ten . Five question focus wrist pain , ten question focus function . The patient ask describe pain well function involve hand scale answer number pain function calculate one separately analysis . Range Motion Baseline digital goniometer ( Baseline ® , Aurora , IL , USA ) assessment wrist ROM ; flexion , extension [ 14 ] , radial ulnar deviation [ 15 ] . The device display 0 180 degree LCD screen view reading , ability freeze angle measurement reference . The goniometer durable powder-coated steel plastic exterior inch/cm mark screen arm . Grip Strength A Jamar dynamometer measurement grip strength kilogram ( Jamar , J.A . Preston Co. , Michigan , USA ) [ 16,17 ] . The maximal muscle strength measure elbow flexion 90° , wrist place neutral position [ 18 ] . Range motion grip strength perform 3 repetition mean three trial record .</detailed_description>
