	<detailed_description>The goal study determine potential force aerobic exercise augment recovery motor function individual stroke . Current approach stroke rehabilitation involve intensive , therapist-directed task practice expensive case , ineffective foster functional neuromotor recovery . The identification safe , cost-effective approach , force aerobic exercise , augment recovery function achieve task practice simultaneously decrease cardiovascular risk factor prevalent stroke survivor would significant rehabilitation stroke community . Animal study along preliminary human data indicate specific type aerobic exercise ( AE ) , force aerobic exercise ( FE ) , may ideal facilitate motor recovery associate repetitive task practice ( RTP ) . The hypothesis deficit afferent input motor cortical output follow stroke prevents patient achieve maintain exercise intensity sufficient facilitate motor recovery ; therefore , FE need augment voluntary effort achieve great gain recovery . In previous research , safe low extremity FE intervention initially applied individual Parkinson 's disease subsequently individual stroke . Preliminary result indicate complete 8-week FE intervention pair abbreviated session RTP exhibit significantly great improvement Fugl-Meyer score end treatment despite complete 40 % few RTP repetition , compare receive voluntary-rate aerobic exercise ( VE ) RTP time-matched RTP . Improvements cardiovascular fitness lower extremity motor function also evident group engage aerobic exercise ( FE VE ) . Positive result preliminary trial indicate safety , feasibility , initial efficacy combine two mode aerobic exercise training RTP provide rationale systematic large scale trial determine precise role aerobic exercise , force voluntary , facilitate motor recovery follow stroke . For study , 30 individual chronic stroke randomized one follow group : FE = RTP , VE + RTP patient education RTP . All three group receive identical dose contact time 8 week ( 3X per week ) . An intervention group receive 45-minute session patient education pair RTP serve non-exercise control . Clinical biomechanical outcome measure change upper extremity motor function , low extremity motor function , cardiovascular fitness provide complete picture , date , potential neurologic effect AE ( force voluntary ) motor recovery brain function human stroke .</detailed_description>
