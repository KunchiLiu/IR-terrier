	<brief_title>Universal Screening Lynch Syndrome Women With Endometrial Non-Serous Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lynch Syndrome increase individual 's risk several cancer , colorectal , endometrial ( EC ) certain type ovarian cancer ( OC ) . Lynch Syndrome cause inherited change mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene . In study establish proportion EC OC patient Lynch Syndrome . We screen EC OC patient perform MMR immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) surgical specimen . These data use along family history data determine woman high risk Lynch Syndrome . We facilitate referral woman risk Lynch Syndrome genetic counsel behalf treat physician . First degree relative patient find Lynch Syndrome consent participate study also refer genetics study PI . We encourage participant find Lynch Syndrome attend regular colonoscopy screen prevent colorectal cancer , ( female Lynch Syndrome ) consideration gynecologic risk reduce surgery prevent endometrial ovarian cancer . We assess adherence Lynch Syndrome screen guideline population determine universal screen strategy feasible cost-effective widespread implementation across Canada effort prevent Lynch Syndrome associate cancer woman family . In addition , consent patient may provide blood tumour tissue sample sequence study investigate genetic basis Lynch Syndrome shed light case MMR loss absence germline mutation .</detailed_description>
