	<brief_summary>The goal study improve diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) two different stage ( MCI dementia ) illiterate subject , use FDG- fluorodeoxyglucose - florbetapir F 18 -PET imaging . This study compare amyloid load cerebral metabolism dysfunction literate versus illiterate MCI AD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Illiteracy Vulnerability Alzheimer 's Disease : Evaluation Amyloid Pathology PET Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Illiterate , high rate elder multi-cultural population reaching , , 20 % . Most patient usually include research study . Thus , AVILL would specifically focus low educate illiterate patient use PET image early diagnosis . This study would take advantage collaboration recently launch Memento cohort . RATIONALE : 1 . The diagnosis AD early stage disease appear crucial . MCI consider 1st clinical stage disease , long pre-clinical period . 2 . Cognitive reserve modulates relationship cerebral lesion clinical manifestation limit negative impact cerebral lesion cognition . Education commonly-used proxy cognitive reserve . Education interact AD pathology great pathological burden require show effect cognition among subject education . Lower education illiteracy thus consider risk factor develop AD 3 . Diagnosing MCI AD low educate illiterate patient real challenge : 1 . -difficulties cognitive evaluation mostly rely educational background reading ability , 2 . -poor adaptation neuropsychological test , 3 . -lack clinical image data concern patient , often excluded study , poor knowledge evolution disease earlier sign ( MCI ) dementia . 4 . Quantification amyloid deposit PET imaging could therefore useful diagnosis AD illiterate patient . GENERAL OBJECTIVES : - non educate patient amyloid load could differ educate patient amyloid load stage cognitive impairment - PET amyloid image use florbetapir F 18 could detect non educate patient AD risk early stage could help clinical evaluation particularly difficult population . - uptake level florbetapir F 18 could different MCI AD non educate patient compare educated patient basis objective .</detailed_description>
