	<brief_title>Ultra Low Dose 4 Gy Orbital Radiation Definitive Therapy Indolent B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Tests : If agree take part study , follow baseline test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test become pregnant . To take part study , pregnant . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan head neck check status disease . If study doctor think need , may also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - You biopsy eye lesion . You give either general local anesthesia sedation need numb area . - You eye exam eye doctor . This eye exam may include photograph take eye . - If study doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Study Visits : You CT scan without contrast purpose planning radiation . This call `` CT simulation . '' After complete CT simulation , receive low dose radiation contrast 2 day row . Contrast drug allow researcher see difference normal abnormal tissue . Follow Up Visits : Every 3 month : - You eye exam eye doctor . - You MRI CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think need , receive standard dose radiation time . In case , sign separate consent explain risk . Length Study Participation : You may continue take part study long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take part intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction . Your active participation study follow-up visit . This investigational study . It investigational treat B cell lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma involve eye low dose radiation . Radiation therapy give study perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . Up 24 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year old stage IIV indolent B cell lymphoma , include MALT follicular grade I/II . Patients mantle cell lymphoma also include study , mantle cell lymphoma also radiosensitive , despite indolent B cell lymphoma . Patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) ineligible 2 . Patients must measurable disease within orbit , either clinically and/or radiographically biopsy confirmation B cell lymphoma 3 . Bilateral ocular adnexal involvement permit , biopsy confirm unilateral disease high clinical suspicion bilateral disease , biopsy contralateral ocular adnexa waive . 4 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test ( betahCG ) within 2 week protocol entry . 5 . Planned systemic therapy orbital radiation therapy permit however time systemic therapy record patient stratify accord receipt adjuvant systemic therapy . 6 . Male patient must agree use barrier method contraception agree abstain heterosexual activity duration study 7 . Female patient must willing use two adequate barrier method contraception prevent pregnancy agree abstain heterosexual activity throughout study postmenopausal ( free menses &gt; two year surgically sterilize ) . 8 . Patients must ability give informed consent . 1 . Patients treat chemotherapy lymphoma within 4 week protocol enrollment ( include Rituxan ) . 2 . Patients aggressive B cell lymphoma histology , include diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) grade 3 follicular lymphoma . 3 . Patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) 4 . Patients history prior radiation orbit retreatment would exceed know orbital tolerance 5 . Patients preexist retinopathy 6 . Patients pregnant 7 . Patients active lupus scleroderma ineligible</criteria>
