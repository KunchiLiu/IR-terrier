	<brief_summary>This research trial study two type test , ultrasound test biomarker test , see well predict aggressive ( invasive ) bladder cancer sample patient bladder cancer . The aggressiveness tumor mean likely invade body spread . The ultrasound test use fluorescent dye stimulates cell microscope see respond . This may allow doctor predict likely cancer cell spread body . The biomarker test use laboratory test sample patient study gene molecule may predict cancer invasiveness . Comparing two different way predict cancer aggressiveness may help doctor identify well work , may eventually allow doctor predict aggressiveness without need take biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish association bladder cancer disease stage level invasiveness measure novel ultrasound assay . II . To establish association bladder cancer disease stage expression novel invasiveness biomarkers related RE1-silencing transcription factor ( REST ) gene . OUTLINE : Previously collect tumor tissue sample , bladder washing , urine cell stain calcium dye , wash immersed external buffer solution , transfer ultrasound image system . Tissue , bladder wash cell urine cell sample also analyze biomarkers invasiveness derive related REST gene via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) , Western blot , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) .</detailed_description>
