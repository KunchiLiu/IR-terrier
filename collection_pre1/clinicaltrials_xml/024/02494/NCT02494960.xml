Enrolled patient ' medical record mark sticker ( red intervention group , green control group ) recruit come back participate hospital . At end clinic session , doctor immediately fill rest part summary form send recruitment form summary form train research assistant email WeChat .

For smoker intervention group , doctor offer brief ( 10-20 second ) WAR smoke cessation intervention ( Warn smoker least one two smoker kill smoking , accord WHO , two three smoker kill smoking ; Advice smoker quit soon possible ; Refer smoker smoke cessation clinic telephone quitlines offer referral card contain contact information smoke cessation clinic and/or quitlines well pictorial information leaflet explain risk smoke ) .

At 1-month FU ( T2 ) , study personnel call participant use tablet PC questionnaire program ass his/her smoke quit outcome . After assessment , train study personnel get information participant ' group status tablet PC . For Group C , train study personnel end phone call without assessment intervention .
