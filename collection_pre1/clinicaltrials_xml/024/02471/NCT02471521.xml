	<brief_summary>The purpose study find optimal inspiratory pressure provide adequate tidal volume prevent gastric insufflation pediatric patient . The child 5 year old randomly assign muscle relaxation group non-relaxation group . For muscle relaxation group , routine anesthesia induction perform muscle relaxant mask ventilation start pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation . Gastric auscultation abdominal ultrasonography perform simultaneously mask ventilation detect inflow air . Initial inspiratory airway pressure 10 cmH2O increase gradually 2 cmH2O gastric insufflation detect either two method . Tracheal intubation do detection gas . For non-relaxation group , mask ventilation perform manner , without muscle relaxant . After detection gas two method , rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg administer tracheal intubation perform .</brief_summary>
