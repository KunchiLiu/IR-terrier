	<brief_summary>Background : - In lifetime , person may encounter ten thousand chemical use ingredient product buy . It easy measure company sell product tell exact chemical ingredient . Researchers want compare exist method ( e.g. , survey model ) measure exposure chemical personal care household product . Objective : - To test improve way study gather data contact chemical find consumer product . Eligibility : - Healthy woman volunteer age 35 74 use least 15 consumer product day . Design : - Participants screen medical history , pregnancy test , smoke test , blood sample . They answer question home product use . - Participation last 30 hour 12 day . - Researchers : - Place air sampler inside outside participant home 10 day . One sampler need plug electrical outlet . It make low , continuous sound operation . - Collect house dust sample record consumer product house . - Visit house daily collect sample . - Participants : - Give blood sample clinic twice . - Collect urine void 10 day . They label put special cooler . - Wear 4 small device measure air pollution , chemical , location , activity . - Record eat consumer product use . They write diary &lt; TAB &gt; photograph iPhone provide . - On day 2 study , collect duplicate sample eat . - Take iPhone video use certain product . - Answer question chemical ingredient personal care product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research advance characterization environmental chemical exposure improve exposure assessment , individual population level , research priority identify Strategic Research Action Plan U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) Chemical Safety Sustainability ( CSS ) program ( EPA 2012 ) National Institutes Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) Strategic Plan 2012-2017 ( NIEHS 2012 ) . Leading Strategic Plan , specific research priority relate exposure assessment identify 2011 NIEHS workshop Advancing Research Mixtures : New Perspectives Approaches Predicting Adverse Human Health Effects '' , include need evaluate utility exist instrument classify quantify exposure , develop good tool improve exposure assessment , good understand nature combine exposure ( e.g. , mixture ) . This project inform research priority identify NIEHS strategic plan several specific research need discuss 2011 NIEHS workshop mixture , focus assessing exposures personal care household product : - Evaluate current exposure assessment technology , include questionnaire - Develop good model link source behavior predict exposure - Analyze combine exposure - Evaluate usefulness commercially available product use/marketing databases - Evaluate prediction model - Characterize behavior impact exposure use new technology ( cell phone/internet use ) Personal care product ( PCPs ) household/consumer product particular interest efficiency delivery widespread use . Exposure chemical PCPs result either direct indirect route contact depend use product ( Dodson 2012 ; Koniecki et al . 2011 ; Rudel et al . 2003 ; Schettler 2006 ; Weschler Nazaroff 2014 ) . Health concern exist chemical find PCPs household setting . Over course lifetime , average consumer may encounter ten thousand chemical use ingredient consumer product , many proprietary ; thus , get complete picture human exposome challenging . Given large number co-occurring chemical product , new strategy , tool , technique need develop evaluated utility assess exposure multitude ( tens thousand ) chemical represent reality exposure . Innovative tool need evaluate potential contribution exposure assessment rapid , cost-efficient method allow simultaneous measurement multiple chemical agent gather contextual information inform exposure reduction . These integrated tool technique use refine measurement predictive modeling method support high throughput chemical analysis exposure assessment . The propose research concept represent collaboration NIEHS ( Division National Toxicology Program , Division Intramural Research , Clinical Research Unit ) EPA Office ofResearch Development ( ORD ) . The partnership include co- funding EPA , share equipment expertise , use EPA field team extensive collection exposure information .</detailed_description>
