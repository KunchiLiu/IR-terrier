	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) prevalent disease cause lateral curvature spine . Spine curvature increase youths puberty progress . The recommended treatment AIS different depend spine deformity condition . For mild scoliosis ( Cobb 's angle ≤ 20° ) , periodic observation suggest . For scoliosis case Cobb 's angle ≤ 40° , rigid brace treatment recommend . A rigid brace make rigid plastic material restrict nearly movement wearer , cause irritation . Flexible brace alternative option , however , efficiency treatment questionable term control spine curvature progression . Biofeedback proven effective number physical , psychological psychophysical problem . The basic aim biofeedback therapy support patient realize his/her self-ability control specific psychophysiological process . In study , biofeedback embed tank-top specialized design adolescent treatment option AIS patient monitor daily posture wearer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project aim combine clinical experience textile biofeedback mechanism research develop biofeedback embed tank-top AIS . As result , reduce future likelihood brace wear surgery . In study , eligible subject give tailor-made biofeedback tank-top wear 8 hour daily . Monitor , observation additional posture training session provide 6 month wear period . The effectiveness biofeedback tank-top evaluated pre-and post- treatment ultrasonic imaging device ( measure angle spine ) , electromyography muscle signal assessment clinical photograph assessment .</detailed_description>
