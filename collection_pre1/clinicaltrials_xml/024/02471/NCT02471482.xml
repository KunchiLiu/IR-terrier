	<brief_title>Effect Mozart Music Cerebral Oxygenation Behavioural Response Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Group : Stable Infants correct age 28-32weeks enrol seven day age accord inclusion criterion . An informed write consent obtain parents/guardians provide information leaflet verbal explanation . INCLUSION CRITERIA : - Babies correct age 28-32 ( 28+0 to32+0 ) week gestation , seven day old - Breathing spontaneously room air stable nCPAP FiO2 requirement le 30 % - Not require inotropic support - On full enteral feed . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : - Babies major congenital abnormality - Intraventricular haemorrhage grade 3 4 cystic periventricular leucomalacia cranial ultrasound Study Design : A randomize crossover study conduct tertiary care level Coombe Women Infants University Hospital , Dublin . As randomize crossover study , baby act his/her control . Enrolled baby randomize 'Music ' 'No Music ' . All baby study one hour feed . The baby randomize 'Music ' play music 30 minute record cerebral oxygenation ( use Near infrared spectroscopy ) vital sign ( respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation frequency apneic episode every 10 minute ) follow 10 minute `` washout '' period period music next 30 minute ( variable record outlined music session ) . Baby randomize 'No Music ' music first 30 minute study follow 10 minute `` washout '' period 30 minute music . This cycle repeat every 6 hour 24 hour . In addition investigator observe behavioral response baby study period video record 'Mute ' video record review developmental staff . The behavior document 'Neonatal Behavioral Observation Sheet ' . The observation include , addition vital sign , facial expression , posture motor response baby phase music music . The investigator plan blind study medical staff also researcher time study ( use research blind mode near infrared spectroscopy machine ) . In mode data store , however displayed time study . Recorded Mozart Lullaby play . The noise level keep 45db recommended American Academy Pediatrics monitor sound monitor place incubator study period . Enrolled baby hear screening perform prior discharge hospital . Randomization : Sealed opaque envelope Music : The music use Mozart Lullaby . This play small MP3 place baby 's incubator 5cm away baby 's head . The noise level aim keep 45dB per hospital recommendation adjusting volume MP3 player . TheMP3 player cover clean plastic bag hygiene purpose . The background keep minimum study period . Statistical analysis : Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software , V.17 . Data analyze t-test determine significant difference cerebral blood flow phase without music . Significance define p &lt; 0.05 . As data normal brain oxygenation cohort study , investigator plan enroll 30 infant pilot phase .</detailed_description>
