	<detailed_description>This study prospective , double-arm , randomize , open-label , dose-escalation exploratory clinical trial involve HIV-1 infected participant treat suppressive combination antiretroviral combination therapy ( cART ) . The primary objective study evaluate new strategy reduce residual reservoir HIV-1 infect cell persist despite treatment current HIV drug . The clinical trial conduct Infectious Diseases Clinical Trials Unit ( CTU ) Massachusetts General Hospital . The study medication include two agent : Panobinostat oral tablet reverse HIV-1 latency awaken HIV `` sleep '' condition protect human immune system . The second drug interferon-alpha2a , injectable cytokine activate immune system . The combined use agent may lead immune-mediated elimination HIV-1 infect cell viral latency reverse panobinostat . All participant receive one week treatment panobinostat ( 5mg , dose every second day Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) , follow three week off-treatment . Participants randomize receive treatment course panobinostat alone ( Arm A , 2 participant total ) , combination pegylated IFN-alpha2a ( Arm B , 6 participant total ) . Subcutaneous injection pegylated Interferon-alpha2a administered start week-long treatment course , simultaneously first dose panobinostat . ART continue entire treatment duration study participant . Participants undergo close monitoring side effect entire time study participation . The total study duration 2 month .</detailed_description>
