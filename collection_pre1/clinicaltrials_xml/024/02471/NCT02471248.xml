	<brief_summary>A novel interactive exoskeleton robotic system embed force motion sensor develop facilitate walk stroke patient hemiparesis . The robot synchronise gait pattern stroke patient provide assistance ankle dorsiflexion swing phase . It hypothesise robot facilitate stable longer walk distance stroke patient drop foot problem . It apply unilateral side , suitable stroke patient hemiparesis . The whole system design lightweight , compact , comfortable , user-friendly hospital home setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interactive Exoskeleton Robot Walking - Ankle Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical trial , participate stroke patient divide two group : Robotic group Sham group . Stroke patient group participate 20-session gait training program , include overground walk stair climb exercise . Robotic group walk power Ankle Robot , provide ankle dorsiflexion support swing phase walking ; Sham group walk Ankle Robot low assistance level , provide tactile feedback ankle support order evaluate placebo effect . A series clinical assessment carry assess functional recovery stroke patient gait train program .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Ischemic hemorrphagic stroke drop foot problem . 2 . Sufficient cognition follow simple instruction understand content purpose study . ( MiniMental State Examination &gt; 21 ) 3 . Capable stand walk independently extend period time . ( Functional Ambulation Category &gt; 3 , Berg Balance Scale &gt; 40 ) 1 . Any medical psychological dysfunction would affect ability comply test study protocol , low back pain , neuralgia , rotational vertigo , muscloskeletal disorder , injury , pregnancy . 2 . Any severe contracture hip , knee , ankle joint would preclude passive range motion low extremity . 3 . Participation therapeutic treatment ( `` outside therapy '' ) perform low extremity plan study , include baseline followup .</criteria>
