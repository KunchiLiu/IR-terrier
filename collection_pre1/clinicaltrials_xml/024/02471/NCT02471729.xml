	<brief_summary>Management chronic heart failure ( CHF ) major public health problem . It associate high mortality , frequent hospitalization represent large cost health care system . Both pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention n't show effective reduce morbidity mortality patient able modulate activity neuro-hormonal system among sympathetic nervous system . Recent data emphasize potential role sympathetic renal denervation patient hypertension . CHF per se even CHF associate comorbity lead significant increase level sympathetic tone . This largely induced autonomic dysfunction chemo baroflex abnormality . These patient usually suffer condition allow upgrade adapt drug sympathetic condition . Hence CHF patient chronic kidney disease , anemia markedly high sympathetic activity expose high level RAS Blockers beta blocker due renal dysfunction , thus remain elevated sympathetic activity worsen symptom prognosis . Chronic heart failure affect around 100 million people worldwild impose significant burden health care system throughout world . Even though symptom improve heart failure therapy , remain significantly disable many patient . Chronic activation sympathetic nervous system major component heart failure involve efferent afferent pathway brain many organ . A new therapy directly target nerve traffic-renal artery denervation- show effective drug resistant hypertension , average drop blood pressure 33/12 mm hg . The cardiologist team private hospital Arnault Tzanck willing therefore conduct study 12 patient chronic systolic heart failure undergo bilateral renal denervation intensive protocol observation assessment compring 3 day hospital stay post procedure 3 6 month regular outpatient follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal denervation new interventional cardiology technique involve use catheter femoral artery , insert RF probe destroy nerve fiber contact wall renal artery small electric current . The method utilize energy emit miniaturized device position end catheter . This catheter position artery go kidney . Sympathetic overactivation , reduce renal denervation drug-resistant hypertension . Several study conduct patient without heart failure show renal denervation reduces leave ventricular hypertrophy beyond effect blood pressure . Chronic activation sympathetic nervous system major component heart failure involve efferent afferent pathway brain many organ . The purpose Clinical investigation evaluate safety performance EnligHTNâ„¢ Renal Denervation System treatment patient chronique heart failure . All patient stable maximal tolerate pharmacological therapy HFC prior denervation . After procedure patient monitor inpatient 3 day hemodynamic disturbance could identify . Baseline measurement , include BNP , echo Doppler VO2 six minute walk test repeat discharge hospital . After discharge patient follow weekly 4 week 3 6 month . At end study , bnp , echo Doppler Vo2 six minute walk test repeat , also ask categorize feeling worse , , good comparison preprocedural state .</detailed_description>
