	<brief_summary>Pneumococcal infection lead cause adult childhood hospitalization death . It show obese individual high risk bacterial infection . As result , investigator vaccinate obese individual see offer level protection vaccine normal-weight individual . The vaccine use particular bacterial infection call Pneumovax 23 . The purpose study compare body mass index affect protection vaccine provide bacteria . Primary Hypothesis : Levels protection vaccine different pre- post- vaccination healthy BMI individual obese individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Obesity Immune Response Pneumovax 23</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Participants : For study , investigator recruit 56 participant separate two group . Group 1 enroll 23 individual BMI 22 25 . Group 2 enroll 23 obese individual . Study participant age 18-35 good health . Pre-Screening : Basic eligibility first determine phone questionnaire . The investigator acquire weight height information calculate BMI , well ask chronic health problem . At end pre-screening , email address request order email copy consent form participant review first visit , consent form review participant question address . A cell phone number also request text participant reminder night appointment ( visit 1 visit 2 ) . If participant decline reminder text , reminder phone call set-up . Screening : During in-person screening , investigator ask several question . Participants chronic health problem ( significant vascular disease , hepatitis , renal disease , diabetes , immunodeficiency ) exclude . Individuals already immunize Pneumovax23 Prevnar ( another vaccine protect pneumococcal infection ) also exclude . A pregnancy test give female exclude pregnant individual . An HbA1C ( finger prick get drop blood ) also perform exclude participant high blood sugar level . Physical exam perform vitals take participant pass initial screening help assess health . Questionnaires also give first visit ass stress , show affect ability protect infection . Study Visits : All participant receive Pneumovax 23 vaccine , questionnaire , physical exam , undergo 2 blood draw . Part blood send research laboratory gene analysis . This help u determine certain genetic marker explain individual difference Pneumovax 23 efficacy .</detailed_description>
