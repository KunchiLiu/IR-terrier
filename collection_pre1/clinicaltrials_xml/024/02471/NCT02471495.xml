	<detailed_description>The study consist three period : 1 ) Screening ; 2 ) Induction , 3 ) Maintenance treatment follow-up . Screening period After sign informed consent , patient screen study eligibility assessment inclusion exclusion criterion . Screening procedure include collection demographic data , medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory evaluation . Induction period Patients receive 8 weekly treatment RITE + MMC , use Synergo® System . Each treatment last 60 minute consist two 30-minute cycle 40 mg MMC/50 ml sterile water injection cycle . These 8 treatment follow pause ( see Table 1 ) , follow-up cystoscopy ( first follow-up control ) conduct Weeks 12-13 ( first treatment ) . Maintenance Treatment Follow-up Period During maintenance period , patient receive one Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment every 6 week . Each treatment last 60 minute consist two 30-minute cycle 40 mg MMC/50 ml sterile water injection cycle . Maintenance treatment give end 12 month patient 's first induction treatment , unless patient 's participation study terminate due either : 1. lack complete response ( 6 month ) worsen disease ( 3 month ; see first second follow-up control ) , 2. recurrence/progression Patients assess cystoscopy , urine cytology , require , subsequent biopsy transurethral resection ( TUR ) suspect area every 3 month till end study . Two consecutive definite positive urine cytology require confirm persistent recurrent disease visual biopsy negative . In case , investigation extravesical location ( CT-IVU , prostatic urethra biopsy ) perform first second urine cytology . At first follow-up control , i.e. , 3 month administration first study treatment , patient undergo cystoscopy evaluation . Patients fail achieve disease-free state time first follow-up continue study , unless new occurrence T1 and/or high-grade lesion find extra-bladder involvement evident pathological analysis . At second , i.e. , 6-month , follow-up visit , patient undergo biopsy suspicious area random bladder biopsy trigone , bladder dome , right , leave , anterior posterior bladder wall . Upper tract wash perform patient urine cytology positive pathological evidence NMIBC lesion bladder prostatic urethra . Patients fail achieve disease-free state time 6 month assessment and/or experience new disease occurrence , demonstrate cystoscopy biopsy , and/or extra-bladder involvement suggest positive upper tract wash result remove study . Upper tract image ( CT-IVU imaging recommend , IVU CT available ) perform 12 month first study treatment . Extended treatment follow-up period For longer-term disease-free-survival data collection purpose , patient free tumor end study offer continue receive one Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment every 8 week . Each treatment last 60 minute consist two 30-minute cycle 40 mg MMC/50 ml sterile water injection , cycle . These treatment give end 24 month patient 's first induction treatment . See table 2 detail extend treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
