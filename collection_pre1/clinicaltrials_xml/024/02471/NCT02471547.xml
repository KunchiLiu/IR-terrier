	<brief_summary>Transurethral Resection Bladder Tumor ( TURBT ) initial treatment procedure urinary bladder cancer . Recurrence rate first year range 15-38 % case low-intermediate disease . Current literature advocate use intravesical instillation Mitomycin-C ( MMC ) immediately post TURBT order reduce rate recurrence . During last decade , heat intravesical instillation emerge additional player , treatment recurrent disease . By case , heat intravesical instillation give either microwave hyperthermia ( synergoÂ® ) conductive heat bladder wall thermo-chemotherapy ( BWT ) . Previous report suggest 59 % reduction rate recurrence follow thermo-chemotherapy upon recurrent disease . These outstanding reduction result n't convince significant amount urologist worldwide use intravesical instillation close endoscopic resection TURBT , probably due fear MMC adverse effect operate area fear complication due perforate bladder . Preliminary result suggest favourable outcome MMC use prior TURBT [ see publication ] . To investigator ' knowledge previous study prospectively examine effect preliminary heat intravesical installation BWT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravesically Heated Thermo-chemotherapy With Mitomycin-C Prior TURBT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific hypothesis : Patients treat preliminary intravesical installation timely fashion TURBT expect show lower recurrence rate well outcome control patient . Participants : Three hundred patient design undergo TURBT urology department `` Sheba '' Medical Center `` Tel Hashomer '' , Israel . Exiting research : 1 . Patient complete procedure due allergic reaction serious adverse effect heat intravesical instillation . 2 . Patient accord pathology report muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) expect undergo cystectomy . Protocol step Eligible patient give consent participate study . A preliminary grouping ( low , intermediate high risk group ) initiate accord cystoscopy examination result . ( step administrative purpose order achieve equal amount participant group follow-up phase ) Then participants randomly assign , accord randomize computer software two major arm , receive heat thermo-chemo therapy . The intravesical instillation take place 6 hour prior TURBT follow matter : The `` Elmedical '' system introduce intravesically 40mg heat Mitomycin-C ( MMC ) , dilute 50cc saline uniform temperature ( 44-44.50C ) . The length procedure - 50 minute . Once pathological report arrive , participant assign his/her actual risk group stratification . Participants recurrent disease assign separated intermediate high risk group accordingly . consequently five stratification group create major research arm ( without prior heat intravesical instillation ) Follow-up participant , group take two year . During follow-up period urine cytology routine cystoscopy carry every 3 month . Patients intermediate high risk disease receive six course intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) installation accord international guideline . Participants reason wo n't able complete BCG intravesical instillation offer MMC instillation instead . Participant pathological report indicate muscle invasive disease offer cystectomy exit study ( unless participant avoids cystectomy his/her decision ) . The investigator obligate surveillance accord international guideline ( intravesical instillation BCG perform repeat TURBT / Biopsy need ) . Potential bias : Different surgical skill urologist , Quality pre-TURBT installation thermo-chemotherapy . Duration : Four year two year follow per participant .</detailed_description>
