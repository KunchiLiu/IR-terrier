	<brief_summary>This research test combination two new drug , call ibrutinib ABT199 , take together treatment Mantle Cell Lymphoma . Other study indicate potential drug use treatment participant Mantle Cell Lymphoma . In study , investigator test combination two drug together , order determine effect ( good bad ) mantle cell lymphoma . This study two phase . The first phase Primary Evaluation Phase closely monitor effect ibrutinib ABT199 period 13 month . Participants complete 13 month treatment continue benefit study treatment allow continue drug progression intolerance Continuation Phase . The purpose phase provide patient continue access ibrutinib ABT199 . Patients receive routine care clinician , record sideeffects may experience . This one first trial world study combination ibrutinib ABT199 together . Therefore effectiveness combination study drug assess , affect mantle cell lymphoma develop resistance treatment . The investigator also know whether combine two drug together cause unexpected side effect . Therefore , study monitor patient closely perform scan , blood test , bone marrow biopsy test regular interval .</brief_summary>
