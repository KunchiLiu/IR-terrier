	<brief_summary>This study enroll patient pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) treat inhaled treprostinil . During study , treatment inhale treprostinil taper simultaneously replaced oral treatment ( selexipag ) target disease similar way . The purpose study ) investigate safety tolerability oral selexipag patient transition inhale treprostinil , ii ) investigate effect oral selexipag PAH severity exercise ability transition , iii ) gain new information patient experience take oral selexipag compare inhaled treprostinil . Study participant may stay study FDA grant marketing authorization .</brief_summary>
