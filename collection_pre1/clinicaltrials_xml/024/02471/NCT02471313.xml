	<brief_summary>Background : - Treatment liver cancer include surgery , transplant , chemotherapy . It also include minimally invasive tumor treatment transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) . TACE treatment liver cancer help control cancer consider cure . Researchers want learn effect TACE liver tumor surround tissue . To , use positive emission test ( PET ) radioactive tracer call [ 18F ] FMISO . Objectives : - To see [ 18F ] FMISO useful evaluate happen liver tumor surround tissue TACE . Eligibility : - People age 18 old liver cancer approve TACE . Design : - Participants meet study researcher see take part study . - Participants TACE separate NCI protocol hospital NIH Clinical Center . - Before TACE , participant CT MRI abdomen . For scan , lie machine take picture body . They also blood test physical exam . - The [ 18F ] FMISO imaging study perform NIH . - Participants intravenous catheter place arm ( one ) . The [ 18F ] FMISO tracer inject . - Participants PET-CT scan . Each scan take 30 minute . - Some participant also [ 18F ] FMISO PET-CT scan TACE . - As part standard care TACE , participant CT MRI scan regular interval . This evaluate tumor response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - TACE standard therapy inoperable primary liver cancer tumor control prior transplantation . The mechanisms TACE failure remain poorly understood . - Although acute hypoxia significant tumor necrosis occur follow TACE , tumor adaptive response localization well characterize . - Imaging tool use hypoxia-specific tracer [ ( 18 ) F ] FMISO may help identify pattern distribution acute post-TACE tumor hypoxia relative demonstrate tumor progression . - The primary hypothesis study state tumor progression post-TACE arises change tumor phenotype induce treatment-related hypoxia superimpose dynamic process underlie tumor hypoxia . Objectives -To determine feasibility hypoxic tumor identification despite relatively high liver background signal , describe pattern tumor hypoxia immediate post-TACE treatment period use PET image [ ( 18 ) F ] MISO uptake register cross-sectional imaging . Eligibility - Patients great equal 18 year inoperable primary hepatic malignancy hepatic-dominant metastatic-disease otherwise eligible receive TACE treatment . Patients hepatocellular carcinoma intermediate stage disease accord BCLC staging system ( Stage A4 B ) . - Patients must chemotherapy- radiation therapy liver least 2 week prior start study treatment . - Patients must acute , critical illness . - Patients must pregnant - Able understand willing sign write informed consent Design - Fifteen patient primary metastatic liver malignancy enrol pilot , non-randomized , open study feasibility use ( 18 ) F-fluoromisonidazole PET scan determine hypoxic tumor identification localization , identify pattern distribution acute post-TACE tumor hypoxia relative demonstrate tumor progression . - Twenty-four seventy-two hour standard care TACE , patient undergo PET scan use 0.1mCi/kg ( maximum 10mCi ) ( 18 ) F-fluoromisonidazole [ ( 18 ) F ] MISO ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must confirm inoperable primary hepatic malignancy hepatic dominant metastatic neoplastic disease evidence histology cytology , characteristic enhancement pattern CT MRI together abnormal serum alphafetoprotein &gt; 200mg/dl case hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients hepatocellular carcinoma conform intermediate stage disease accord BCLC ( 16 ) staging system ( Stage A4 B ) otherwise eligible receive TACE treatment . Patients must chemotherapy radiotherapy liver therapy , malignancy least 2 week ( response adequately assess ) prior treatment must recover clinically significant side effect therapeutic diagnostic intervention . Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl unless measure creatinine clearance great 60ml/min Age great equal to18 year Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patient must able lie still procedure ECOG status less equal 2 In addition , patient receive TACE outside NIH : Patient must physician willing collaborate NIH PI providing require medical record digital MR/ CT scan documentation pre post TACE procedure . Patient must willing sign Authorization Release Medical Information form EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive prior TACE treatment History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition misonidazole agent use study . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients childbearing age must pregnant . The effect [ ( 18 ) F ] FMISO develop human fetus unknown . Pregnancy contraindication TACE .</criteria>
