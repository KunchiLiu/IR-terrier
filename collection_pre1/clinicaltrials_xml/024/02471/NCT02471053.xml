	<detailed_description>As number cancer survivor grow , long-term adverse effect cancer therapy become increasingly apparent . Most prominent toxic effect heart ( cardiotoxicity ) may lead cardiac dysfunction increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Of note , data indicate magnitude CVD risk long-term survivor may exceed risk secondary malignancy , know complication primary cancer therapy . While long-term follow-up data adult cancer survivor lack , study adult survivor childhood cancer show individual 15 time likely develop congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , 10 time likely develop CVD , 9 time likely suffer stroke compare individual cancer . Thus , clear long-term cardiotoxic effect cancer therapy represent significant concern cancer survivor . The mechanism responsible damaging effect cancer therapy fully understood , however need maximize benefit treatment minimize long-term damage . Recent animal study suggest aerobic exercise training may offer protective effect chemotherapy-induced heart disease . However , investigator 's knowledge , study date examine potential cardioprotective benefit exercise train patient receive cancer treatment . Accordingly , purpose pilot study evaluate feasibility efficacy 12-week supervised exercise program base principle cardiac rehabilitation patient receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Feasibility assess evaluate three outcome , recruitment rate , adherence rate ( i.e . exercise class attendance record ) , attrition rate , safety ( i.e . number adverse event ) . Efficacy assess evaluate change health-related outcome assess change equal well measure baseline . The health-related outcome include cardiac function biological marker cardiotoxicity .</detailed_description>
