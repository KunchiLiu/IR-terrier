	<brief_summary>Background : Research show restrict calorie positive effect immune cell health healthy people . Researchers want learn help people asthma . They want good understand body immune response lung function respond short-term calorie restriction . For , want people fast ( food drink except water ) 24 hour . Objective : To explore benefit calorie restriction people asthma . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 60 history consistent asthma prior documentation airflow obstruction wheezing . Design : - Participants take part asthma research NIH screen telephone interview . All participant medical history , blood test , physical exam . - Eligible participant return NIH Clinical Center one morning 2 hour . They feed breakfast . They may blood urine test . - Participants fast 24 hour . - Participants return Clinical Center next morning 4 hour . They blood drawn . They eat breakfast repeat blood draw 2.5 hour later . They urine test . - Blood urine test do end fast meal confirm participant fast full 24-hour period . - Participants lung function test exhale gas measurement . A machine measure volume air breathe . Some gas breath increase inflammation . Participants breathe machine analyze gas breath .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NLRP3 inflammasome part innate immune system activate atherosclerosis , gout diabetes ( sterile inflammation ) . As mitochondrial signal trigger NLRP3 inflammasome , initially propose fasting , via nutrient-sensing mitochondrial program , would dampen innate immune program . Our preliminary data show 24-hour fast blunt NLRP3 inflammasome activation healthy young individual . Interestingly , inflammasome program implicate pathophysiology bronchoreactivity link asthma intermittent fast find reduce disease exacerbation asthmatic patient . The objective protocol extend investigation , find young control normal volunteer , enable u investigate stable mild-moderate asthmatic subject determine whether fast blunt inflammasome activation ass whether transient nutrient-deprivation maneuver improve airflow . Blood sample pulmonary function test assay immune response bronchoreactivity perform subject response 24-hour fast ( water intake restrict ) follow re-testing 3 hour fix caloric meal . The objective pilot study identify immune adaptive pathway subdue human subject know inflammasome link disease . Additionally , study may enable u identify potential therapeutic pathway blunt/negate inflammation associate nutrient-excess associate bronchoreactivity asthma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female age 18 60 Asthmatic subject history consistent asthma , chronic asthma therapy prior documentation reversible airflow obstruction base upon either positive response inhale bronchodilator positive methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge test EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects concurrent acute illness chronic illness associate inflammation include diabetes require medical management . Female subject pregnant lactate Subjects donate blood participate another clinical trial involve blood draw last 8 week . Medical condition identify screening bloodwork would preclude safe participation valid data collection .</criteria>
