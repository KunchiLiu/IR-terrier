	<brief_summary>Background : - A combination daily drug ( call cART ) keep human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) low long time . But cART lose effectiveness cause permanent side effect . If treatment stop , HIV level go . Researchers want see new product control HIV level person cART . Objective : - To see new product VRC01 safe control HIV level blood person take cART . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 65 HIV willing interrupt treatment least 24 week . Design : - Participants screen : - Physical exam - Medical history - Heart test - Blood urine test . - Their HIV drug may switch . They keep take day Visit 1 . - Visit 1 : Repeat screening procedure . - Participants also genetic test leukapheresis . For , blood remove needle one arm circulate machine remove white blood cell . The rest &lt; TAB &gt; blood return needle arm . - They get first study drug dose thin tube arm vein 1 hour . - For 24 week , participant 15 visit . They blood draw every visit . At visit repeat screen procedure get another VRC01 dose . They may another leukapheresis . - Four week last dose , participant restart cART . For 20 week , monthly visit repeat screen procedure discuss new symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance antibody clone technology lead discovery number highly potent , HIV-specific , broadly neutralize monoclonal antibody B cell HIV-infected individual . It show certain broadly neutralize HIV-specific antibody prevent acquisition virus , suppress viral replication , delay and/or prevent plasma viral rebound follow treatment interruption Simian Immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) -infected animal block cell-to-cell transmission laboratory-adapted HIV vitro . However , unclear vivo effect antibody might plasma viral rebound HIV-infected individual follow discontinuation combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) . In regard , show virtually infected individual initiate cART chronic phase infection experience plasma viral rebound upon cessation therapy . Current research treatment HIV-infected individual heavily focus develop strategy aim achieve sustain virologic remission absence cART . Thus , great interest investigate whether potent HIV-specific monoclonal antibody , VRC01 , prevent plasma viral rebound infect individual upon discontinuation cART . We propose examine effect VRC01 plasma viral rebound HIV-infected individual follow analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Age 1865 year old . 2 . HIV1 infection clinically stable . 3 . In general good health identify primary health care provider medical management HIV infection willing maintain relationship primary health care provider medical management HIV infection participate study . 4 . CD4+ cell count &gt; 450 cells/mm^3 screening . 5 . Documentation continuous cART treatment suppression plasma viral level limit detection great equal 3 year . Subjects blip ( i.e. , detectable viral level cART ) prior screen may include provide satisfy follow criterion : 1 . The blip &lt; 400 copies/mL , 2 . Succeeding viral level return level limit detection subsequent testing . 6 . Willingness undergo ATI . 7 . Laboratory value within predefined limit screen : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm^3 . 2 . Hemoglobin level &gt; 10.0 g/dL men &gt; 9.0 g/dL woman . 3 . Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3 . 4 . Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 5 . Estimated measured creatinine clearance rate great equal 50 mL/min determine NIH Clinical Center laboratory . 6 . AST ALT level &lt; 2.5 x ULN . 8 . Willingness sample store future research . Reproductive Risks Contraception : The effect VRC01 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate pregnancy prevention per investigator . This include highly reliable establish lifestyle complete abstinence potentially reproductive sexual activity , use BOTH long term hormonal barrier ( e.g . implant , depot injection , IUD female participant female partner participant ) method contraception fully effective prior dosing , COMBINED WITH barrier method ( male female condom ) potentially reproductive sexual activity . Pregnancy prevention must maintain effective practice continuously duration study participation . Females childbearingage must negative pregnancy test result prior receive VRC01 . During course study , female participant , partner male participant suspect fact become pregnant , effect participant inform study staff immediately , well woman primary care physician . Subjects must use safe sex practice trial , particularly ATI phase , risk transmission HIV may increase . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Chronic hepatitis B , evidence positive test hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , evidence positive test HCV RNA . Subjects positive test HCV antibody negative test HCV RNA eligible . 2 . Documented virologic failure &gt; 1 cART regimen . 3 . HIV immunotherapy vaccine ( ) receive within 1 year prior screen . 4 . Any licensed experimental nonHIV vaccination ( e.g. , hepatitis B , influenza , pneumococcal polysaccharide ) receive within 2 week prior study enrollment . 5 . Receipt investigational study agent within 28 day enrollment . 6 . Any active malignancy may require systemic chemotherapy radiation therapy . 7 . Systemic immunosuppressive medication receive within 3 month prior enrollment ( Not exclude : corticosteroid nasal spray inhaler ; topical corticosteroid mild , uncomplicated dermatitis ; oral/parenteral corticosteroid administer nonchronic condition expect recur [ length therapy less equal 10 day , completion great equal 30 day prior enrollment ] ) . 8 . History clinical evidence : 1 . Significant unstable cardiac disease ( e.g. , angina , congestive heart failure , recent myocardial infarction ) . 2 . Severe illness , malignancy , immunodeficiency HIV , condition , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study . 9 . Active drug alcohol use pattern behavior , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . 10 . Breastfeeding .</criteria>
