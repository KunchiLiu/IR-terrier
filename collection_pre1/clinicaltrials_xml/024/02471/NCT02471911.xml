	<brief_summary>This study evaluate addition selinexor ( KPT-330 ) RICE chemotherapy treatment relapse refractory aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma , goal improve response rate ( compare RICE chemotherapy alone ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KPT-330 Plus RICE Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although aggressive B-cell lymphoma potentially curable front-line chemotherapy , least one-third patient experience progression relapse . Second-line regimen rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( RICE ) administer goal cytoreduction prior autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) eligible patient . However , half patient receive salvage treatment ASCT still cure . Selinexor Selective Inhibitor Nuclear Export / SINE compound , new class molecule . SINE compound show induce apoptotic cell death pre-clinical model AML , CLL , T-ALL , Ph+ ALL well B T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Preliminarily , selinexor demonstrate promising single-agent clinical activity patient previously treat NHL include DLBCL , warrant investigation . Based promising preclinical clinical data , selinexor currently evaluation combination chemotherapy solid tumor . The investigator hypothesize combination selinexor plus RICE well-tolerated clinically active participant previously treat aggressive B-cell lymphoma propose phase I trial evaluate combination . Moreover , Investigators evaluate primary patient sample selinexor investigate mechanism action selinexor , include mechanism selinexor sensitizes cell chemotherapy , evaluate novel drug combination aggressive B-cell lymphoma .</detailed_description>
