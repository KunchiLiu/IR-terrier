	<brief_summary>Cancer survival improve steadily due early detection treatment . Despite establish efficacy anthracycline chemotherapy , damage effect heart ( cardiotoxicity ) limit treatment confers acute long term adverse cardiovascular consequence . Protective strategy heart ( cardioprotection ) iron binder ( chelation ) , heart rate ( beta blockade ) blood pressure ( renin angiotensin inhibition ) medication demonstrate promise adult cancer patient , treatment typically prescribe significant change heart chamber size pump ability detect imaging investigation ( myocardial dysfunction ) . Furthermore , conventional therapy constrain important side effect affect bone marrow , blood pressure , kidney . Remote ischaemic conditioning ( RIC ) protect heart activate cell survival pathways brief repeated inflation deflation blood pressure cuff limit blood flow temporarily ( noninjurious ischaemia ) . These innate survival mechanism prevent part cellular injury occur ischaemia reperfusion cascade heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) . Ischaemia reperfusion injury also share common biochemical pathway anthracycline cardiotoxicity , thus RIC may novel form nonpharmacological cardioprotection apply undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy . The investigator propose pilot single centre randomise control trial investigate effect RIC reduce heart muscle damage ( myocardial injury ) anthracycline-treated cancer patient . The investigator assess subclinical myocardial injury use high-sensitivity blood test ( troponin T level ) advance image technique , monitor heart rhythm disturbance ( cardiac arrhythmia ) analyse metabolic change urine blood chemotherapy , specify time point , follow 5 year complete chemotherapy treatment ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study aim demonstrate whether remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIC ) , delivered nonpharmacological treatment via repeat inflation deflation limb blood pressure cuff , reduce subclinical myocardial injury anthracycline chemotherapy . Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity dose limit constraint anthracycline chemotherapy regimen , conventional drug treatment prevent treat limited important interaction blood pressure , kidney function bone marrow function . The lifetime cancer risk 1 2 1 3 general population . Cancer treatment survival improve steadily 50 % patient survive initial cancer diagnosis , approximately 25 50 % survivor abnormal cardiac function next twenty year . Historically , anthracycline chemotherapy dose stratified limit incidence clinical heart failure around 5 % . More recent study report least one third anthracycline chemotherapy patient demonstrate significant rise Troponin level blood biomarker subclinical myocardial injury well document evidence biomarker rise even single cycle chemotherapy , thus absolute threshold myocardial injury may lower thus prevalent conservative figure . In standard dosing regimen , chemotherapy may delay suspend cancer patient base simplified measure ejection fraction ( EF ) measure cardiac systolic function . Conventional heart failure treatments betablockers ACE inhibitor usually prescribe significant fall EF , even though myocardial injury occur long imprecise measurement change . RIC show reduce myocardial injury improve outcome elective emergency percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . The common biochemical pathway ischaemia reperfusion anthracycline-induced cardiac myocyte injury suggest RIC may unexplored nonpharmacological treatment reduce myocardial injury cancer patient . This pilot study aim demonstrate effectiveness RIC elegant noninvasive , nonmedicinal treatment reduce myocardial injury cancer patient , therefore pose significant ethical issue . RIC know safe intervention know significant adverse effect . Some patient report mild discomfort cuff inflation . A small number experience minor skin bruise cuff site transient . There know long term adverse effect RIC , Recruitment Patients identify usual oncology team , refer cardiology team base solely know inclusion exclusion criterion , ensure process free undue influence . The benefit study include increase scientific understand RIC may lead reduction myocardial injury , well longitudinal documentation myocardial injury form blood biomarkers , ECG change , metabolic change , novel image marker cancer patient undergoing common form chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
