ELIGIBILITY : - Patients 16 - 34 year age confirm diagnosis NF1 &gt; 1 plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) . - The patient must obtain mean score 2.0 high score 3 three item Pain Interference Index , report pain interfere function least three month . - The patient must regular access computer tablet internet access . DESIGN : - This psychological intervention study determine potential benefit ACT pain interference , patient randomize ACT intervention wait-list control group . - Patients come NIH 2-day visit ( Time 1 ) .
