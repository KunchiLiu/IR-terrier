	<brief_title>Freeze All Protocol Versus Fresh Embryo Transfer Women Undergoing In-vitro Fertilization ( IVF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treat GnRH antagonist protocol . Recombinant Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) give day 2 day 3 menstrual cycle 5 day . The start dose individualize patient base follow criterion : Anti-Mullerian Hormone ( AMH ) &lt; 0.7 ng/ml , dose 300 IU/day , AMH 0.7 -2.1 ng/ml , dose 225 IU/day , AMH &gt; 2.1 ng/ml , dose 150 IU/day . After , investigator titrate dose base clinical judgment . Follicular development monitor ultrasound scan measurement estradiol , progesterone start day 5 stimulation . Scanning hormonal measurement repeat every 2 3 day , depend size follicle . Antagonist routinely use day 5 day Human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . Criteria recombinant hCG ( 5,000IU 10,000IU ) administration presence least three lead follicle 17 mm . Oocyte retrieval perform 36 hour recombinant hCG administration . Insemination perform use intracytoplasmic sperm injection , 3 - 4 hour oocyte retrieval . Only mature oocyte inseminate . Fertilization perform inverted microscope period 16-18 hour insemination . On day 3 , embryo evaluation perform fixed time point 68±1 hour fertilization , use Istanbul consensus . After grade embryo , eligible patient invite participate study . Written consent obtain patient participation study . Patients randomize 2 group fresh embryo transfer freeze-all . Eligible subject randomize block 4 via computer generate random number list either freeze group fresh embryo transfer ( ET ) group . Freeze group All grade 1 grade 2 embryo cryopreserved use vitrification method . In next cycle , endometrium prepare use estradiol orally , start day 2-3 menstrual cycle . When endometrium thickness reach 8mm , patient start use progesterone vaginally . Embryo transfer perform 3 day use progesterone . On day embryo transfer , embryo thaw . Two hour thaw , survive embryo transfer uterus ultrasound guidance . Luteal-phase support do estradiol 8mg/day vaginal progesterone 800mg/day 7th week gestation . Fresh ET group In fresh ET group , maximum 2 embryo transfer uterus ultrasound guidance . Luteal-phase support continue 7th week gestation either therapy provide use estradiol exogenous progesterone supplementation hCG exogenous progesterone combination . In group , serum hCG measure 2 week embryo transfer , positive , ultrasound scan uterus perform gestational week 7 12 . METHODS STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Ongoing pregnancy rate ( OPR ) . Ongoing pregnancy explain pregnancy positive heart beat beyond 12 week gestation . Secondary endpoint Clinical pregnancy rate . Clinical pregnancy explain presence gestational sac see transvaginal sonography 7 week embryo placement . Implantation rate explain number gestational sac per number embryo transfer . Multiple pregnancy rate . Multiple pregnancy explain two fetal heart rate transvaginal sonography 7 week embryo placement . RANDOMIZATION Randomization perform day 3 , use block 4 via computer generate random number list . Patients allocate either freeze group fresh ET group . STUDY PROCEDURES Patients treat accord local protocol . SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT A review patient information do prior enrolment determine preliminary eligibility accord patient inclusion exclusion criterion . When patient sign inform consent consider enrol study . WITHDRAWAL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Patients leave study time reason wish without consequence treatment . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason . SAFETY REPORTING The investigator inform subject review accredit medical research ethic committee ; anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit medical research ethic committee , except insofar suspension would jeopardize subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep informed . ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS All observe volunteered adverse event , regardless treatment group suspect causal relationship intervention , record . Adverse event define undesirable experience occur subject clinical trial , whether consider related intervention . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investigator staff record . A serious adverse event untoward medical occurrence effect dose result death ; - life threaten ( time event ) ; - require hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation ; - result persistent significant disability incapacity ; - congenital anomaly birth defect ; - new event trial likely affect safety subject , unexpected outcome adverse reaction . All adverse event follow abate , stable situation reach . Depending event , follow may require additional test medical procedure indicate , and/or referral general physician medical specialist . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT The investigator must explain subject nature study , purpose , procedure , expect duration potential risk benefit involve study participation along discomfort may entail . Each subject must inform participation study voluntary withdrawal consent affect right appropriate medical treatment affect doctor relationship . This informed consent give mean standard write statement . It write easily understood subject . The subject give time read understand statement sign consent date document . The subject receive copy write statement sign . PRIVACY ASPECTS Participating subject register 5-digit number . This personal code form retrieve participant . BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT , GROUP RELATEDNESS There insufficient evidence rational policy 2 strategy , freeze fresh ET . The potential benefit freeze high pregnancy rate , low incidence ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) and/or ectopic pregnancy . The potential harm would time-consuming .</detailed_description>
