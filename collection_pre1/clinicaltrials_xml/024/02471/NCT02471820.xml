	<brief_title>Lenalidomide &amp; Adriamycin &amp; Dexamethasone ( RAD ) Newly Diagnosed , Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , non randomize , non- comparative , open label trial ass efficacy safety lenalidomide , adriamycin low dose dexamethasone combination ( RAD ) 45 newly diagnose patient symptomatic multiple myeloma well collect information regard effect regimen angiogenesis bone remodeling study population . The recruitment period estimate 5 month treatment period follow period 4 month 1 month respectively . During treatment initiation visit response combination RAD accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion evaluate , biochemical marker bone metabolism angiogenic cytokine measure well . IMWG Response evaluation repeat day 1 treatment cycle well response evaluation visit . Finally biochemical marker bone metabolism angiogenic cytokine measure end treatment visit .</detailed_description>
