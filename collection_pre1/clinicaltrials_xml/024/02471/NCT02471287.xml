	<brief_summary>Background : Research identify gene involve inherited eye disease . But many disease , gene yet know . Researchers want try find gene . They also hope learn symptom differ people similar gene change . Objective : To learn gene involve eye disease . Eligibility : People know suspect inherited eye disease , relatives . Design : - All participant medical history , physical exam , eye exam . They may blood take . - Participants eye disease may eye cell sample take use swab biopsy procedure . - Participants may skin biopsy . A ( Omega ) -inch piece skin remove . - Participants may blood drawn red blood cell remove . The remain serum make eye drop solution participant . - Participants may provide sample tear , urine , saliva , stool , hair , inner cheek cell . - Participants may retina test . They may also test us light measure retina thickness . - Participants may eye movement test . Electrodes place skin next eye . - Participants may fluorescein angiography . A dye give intravenous line arm . A camera take picture dye flow eye blood vessel . - Participants may microperimetry . They sit computer screen press button see light . - Participants may eye movement test . They wear contact lens goggles watch series spot computer screen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Molecular genetics genomics revolutionize delivery medicine general ophthalmology particular . New treatment prevention strategy rely detailed understanding genetics molecular pathogenesis vision-threatening disease . In addition , order determine whether intervention therapeutic , must first understand best clinical outcome variable measure treatment effect . Because ultimate goal develop disease-specific protocol specific inherited condition , establish protocol help u establish initial critical mass patient knowledge write protocol ; , protocol hypothesis generate . A secondary aim protocol provide mechanism obtain research sample subject may use laboratory investigation ; case , basic research may hypothesis generate and/or hypothesis test . Lastly , Ophthalmic Genetics Branch , leader field sponsor clinical training program , ability serve tertiary referral center nation area undiagnosed genetic eye disease . STUDY POPULATION : One thousand ( 1000 ) individual inherit eye diseases relative enrol . DESIGN : This combined evaluation/treatment protocol genetic repository study . In general , participant undergo complete , age-appropriate , baseline examination provide blood sample . Some participant may undergo specialized ophthalmic and/or systemic testing , felt clinically indicate investigator . In case , collection readily available body fluid ( e.g. , urine , saliva ) and/or punch skin biopsy may also perform diagnostic and/or research purpose . OUTCOME MEASURES : Given breadth age disease process cover protocol , systematically obtain single outcome variable beyond visual acuity research subject . However , detailed , disease-specific finding collect NEI electronic medical record . Findings systemic test outside exam may tabulate separate , secure database laboratory Principal Investigator ( PI ) .</detailed_description>
