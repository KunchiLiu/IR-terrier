	<brief_title>Study Preservation Ovarian Reserve Function During Chemotherapy Breast Cancer Patients Reproductive Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>6.6-12 % woman breast cancer diagnose age 40 year breast cancer account 40 % cancer woman age 40 year.Attributed improved treatment , chemotherapy play major role , 70 % breast cancer patient reproductive age obtain 10-year survival rate . Consequently , question pregnancy premature ovarian failure breast cancer treatment present frequently . Fortunately , available literature provide good evidence pregnancy breast cancer may improve survival . Unfortunately , therapy show preserve fertility patient receive chemotherapy far , although chemotherapy induce ovarian failure , finally result infertility premature ovarian failure , report 60 year . The great rate prepubertal postpubertal woman normal ovarian function chemotherapy support concept suppress ovary great tolerance cytotoxic treatments.While inhibit pituitary ovarian axis , Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) think block follicular development reduce chemotherapy toxicity . Several study reveal GnRHa co-treatment yield statistically significant improvement proportion spontaneous menstrual resumption chemotherapy , compare controls.It noteworthy menses fertility necessarily link . Absence regular menses , particularly patient take tamoxifen ( endocrine therapy breast cancer ) , necessarily imply lack fertility . Conversely , presence menses guarantee fertility.Currently , anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone ( AMH ) consider best biochemical marker assessment reproductive capacity reproductive medicine setting . Because produce granulosa cell grow antral follicle , AMH significant positive correlation quantity quality oocyte . Moreover , measure day minimal fluctuation menstrual cycle.Antral follicle count ( AFC ) vaginal ultrasound also good predictor response exogenous FSH correlate independently number oocyte retrieve vitro fertilization ( IVF ) .This study design make sure effect GnRHa preservation ovarian reserve function breast cancer patient reproductive age treat ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy observe dynamic change AMH AFC pre post chemotherapy ( 1 week chemotherapy , 2 week , half year , 1 year 2 year follow completion chemotherapy ) two group ( one group treat chemotherapy plus GnRHa , one treat chemotherapy merely ) , order provide reliable evidence GnRHa concern preservation ovarian reserve function . At present , report trial . This study first prospective study focus premenopausal breast cancer patient would like preserve ovarian function China . The result adaptable China country Asia breast cancer patient ' age diagnosis younger . The outcome study may offer breast cancer patient reproductive age hope become mother possess vigour youth .</detailed_description>
