	<brief_summary>Opioid pain medication morphine dilaudid commonly use emergency department treat pain patient . Physicians familiar side effect medication ; concern slow stop patient 's breathing , well dangerously lower blood pressure . An alternative medication ketamine . This medication also commonly use emergency department , although typically use help sedate patient uncomfortable procedure . Ketamine also use pain control , much low dosage sedate patient . When used analgesia , typically administer combination opioid pain medication . To date , study look effectiveness safety use low dose ketamine alone comparison use morphine . The purpose study measure well low-dose ketamine treat pain compare morphine look often serious side effect see medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Opioid analgesia standard care treat moderate severe pain emergency department . It effective medication practitioner familiar use . Opioid use without risk , however . In manage acute pain , patient may experience hypotension , respiratory depression , hypoxia , nausea vomiting , dysphoria , itch . Patients risk respiratory depression include advanced age , renal failure , treat multiple sedative . The current recommend dose opioid administration acute pain management approximately 0.1 mg/kg load dose , although source recommend 10 mg patient weigh 50 kg . ( Ducharme 2011 ; Yak 2011 ) A single center study demonstrate patient received average 0.08 mg/kg morphine , adequately control pain ; patient receive initial dose 10 mg. ( Bijur 2012 ) A post-operative pain study demonstrate patient need average 12 mg mean weight-based dose 0.17 mg/kg morphine achieve acceptable level pain reduction determine 30 mm change visual analog scale . ( Aubrun 2003 ) As even patient receive 1 mg hydromorphone , pain would still adequately control . Ketamine dissociative anesthetic noncompetitive antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . Low dose ketamine ( LDK ) ( 0.03-0.05 mg/kg ) analgesic property modulate opioid tolerance hyperalgesia . ( Uprety 2013 ) Currently , ketamine use emergency department moderate sedation `` awake '' intubation . In pre-hospital setting , use management patient excite delirium pain control . ( Keseg 2014 ) ( Wiel 2014 ) ( Jennings 2013 ) Benefits include few serious adverse effect , especially involve respiratory depression hypotension occur high-dose repeat dos opioids . ( Jennings 2013 ) In addition cause hypotension , ketamine elevate patient 's blood pressure , may useful circumstance . ( Johansson 2009 ) Emergence delirium associate ketamine ; rare adverse event usually alleviate benzodiazepine . Additionally , LDK unlikely cause emergence delirium dissociation usually associate large dos . Another potential complication laryngospasm . Fortunately , rare case , patient easily bag event . LDK efficacious reduce multiple type pain variety setting . Ketamine infusion reduce pain vaso-occlusive pain crisis see patient sickle cell anemia . ( Uprety 2013 ) ( Neri 2013 ) ( Jennings 2013 ) In postoperative setting intensive care unit , ketamine reduce amount morphine require control pain . ( Galinski 2007 ) ( Bell 2006 ) ( Herring 2013 ) In out-of-hospital trauma patient , ketamine combine morphine produce superior analgesia morphine alone . All patient receive morphine randomize receive either morphine ketamine analgesia require . Ketamine change visual analog scale ( VAS ) -5.6 ( CI -6.2 -5.0 ) morphine change -3.2 ( CI -3.7 -2.7 ) . ( Jennings 2012 ) In another pre-hospital study , ketamine administered 1030 patient pain anesthesia . No patient incur ketamine-induced respiratory adverse event . ( Bredmose 2009 ) Preliminary study also investigate LDK emergency department ( ED ) . Available research mainly consist retrospective observational data . In observational study perform urban ED California , LDK significantly improve patient 's pain without adversely effect blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory drive . Twenty-four patient age 18 receive ketamine reason include . Three receive ketamine sedation rest receive analgesia . Most patient receive opioids prior receive ketamine , although opioids result improve pain score . On scale 0 10 , ketamine reduce pain 8.9 ± 2.1 3.9 ± 3.4 ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . ( Richards 2013 ) In another observational , ED base study , ketamine use analgesic investigate . Thirty patient variety painful complaint ( abdominal pain , back pain , nephrolithiasis , biliary pain , fracture , sickle cell pain ) enrol . Patients initially administer combination hydromorphone 0.5 mg ketamine 15 mg rescue dose hydromorphone 1 mg available 15 minute 30 minute initial dose analgesia . In 28 patient ( 93 % ) , clinically significant decrease 2 point numerical rating score measure initial administration ; 14 patient report pain score 0 . Fourteen patient refuse additional hydromorphone 24 patient ( 80 % ) either refuse additional hydromorphone 15 minute receive dose 15 minute decline dose 30 minute . Dizziness , nausea , headache , dissociative effect report . ( Ahern 2013 ) Ketamine administer analgesia urban trauma center retrospectively review 35 patient . The common chief complaint abscess ( 46 % ) . The median dose ketamine receive 10 mg ( range 5-35 mg ) ; opioids co-administered almost case ( 91 % ) . LDK improve pain score least 3 point 19/35 patient ( 54 % ) . Eight patient receive post-drug administration pain score . ( Lester 2010 ) A convenience sample patient enrol ED base study British Columbia . Any patient older 6 year age present painful condition eligible enrollment . Patients score least 50 100-mm visual analog score ( VAS ) . All patient receive 0.5 mg/kg intranasal ( IN ) ketamine could receive rescue dose 0.25 mg/kg IN 10 minute VAS &gt; 50 . Within 30 minute , 35 patient ( 88 % ) decrease VAS least 13 mm . Patient report satisfaction mean 7 ( 5-9 ) patient satisfaction scale 1-10 . Dizziness , nausea , fatigue report . ( Andolfatto 2013 ) IN ketamine also demonstrate effective analgesic pediatric adult ED base study . ( Yeaman 2013 ) ( Yeaman 2014 ) While ketamine study ED , available research multiple limitation . Most consists observational retrospective study . As , could multiple explanation result due multiple , uncontrolled confounders . In addition , study include patient painful complaint comparison control group . We plan conduct prospective , randomize study ketamine compare opioids long bone fracture .</detailed_description>
