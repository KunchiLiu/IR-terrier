	<brief_summary>The goal project examine efficacy sensory adapt dental environment ( SADE ) child difficulty tolerate oral care dental clinic . The investigator hypothesize adapt sensory environment dental office modify sound , sight , tactile experience result decrease anxiety , increased cooperation , few behavior problem child Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . This potential contribute increase child comfort well safer , efficient , less costly treatment large population , potentially one-fourth child may benefit sensory adapt dental environment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project , build upon investigator 's previous R34 National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research ( NIDCR ) Planning Feasibility study , design examine efficacy sensory adapt dental environment ( SADE ) enhance oral care child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Children ASD often exhibit sensory over-responsivity confront experiential aspect dental visit exposure bright fluorescent lighting , touch around mouth , texture smell various oral care product . This often result increase anxiety negative behavioral response hinder dentist 's ability perform treatment . In proposed project , investigator test SADE intervention design reduce child 's anxiety negative response oral care . The SADE intervention include adaptation dim lighting , move projection ceiling ( fish , bubble ) , exposure soothe music , application butterfly vest wing wrap around child provide calm sensation . The specific aim conduct randomize clinical trial order : 1 . Determine SADE , relative regular dental environment ( RDE ) , reduce physiological anxiety negative response ( behavioral distress , perception pain , sensory discomfort ) dental clean child ASD . 2 . Identify whether physiological anxiety mediate beneficial effect intervention whether severity ASD communication ability , dental anxiety , sensory over-responsivity , age act moderate variable . 3 . Assess quality care cost effectiveness/savings dental cleaning associate SADE . Research participants 184 ethnically diverse child age 6-12 year . Using randomize counterbalanced study design , child undergo two dental cleaning four month apart : one dental cleaning RDE one dental cleaning SADE . This project significant first full-scale trial intervention design reduce oral care problem child ASD . It theoretically important elucidate mechanism underlie effect SADE intervention . Based study finding , investigator develop model transform standard pediatric dental care modify sensory quality dental environment . This model potential utilized dental clinic worldwide . As , project promise major public health impact insofar potential gain oral health , child comfort , cost-savings dramatic , potentially apply one-fourth child .</detailed_description>
