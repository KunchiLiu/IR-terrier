	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) responsible around 25 % maternal mortality worldwide reach high 60 % countries.PPH also cause long-term severe morbidity , approximately 12 % woman survive PPH severe anemia . Postpartum hemorrhage define blood loss excess 500 ml vaginal birth excess 1 L cesarean delivery.For clinical purpose , blood loss potential produce hemodynamic instability consider PPH . However , clinical estimate blood loss often inaccurate . Primary ( immediate ) PPH occur within first 24 hour delivery approximately 70 % case due uterine atony . Furthermore , uterine tony define failure uterus contract adequately child bear . Guidelines management postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) involve stepwise approach include exclusion retain product conception genital tract trauma . Uterine atony , common cause , management uterine atony establish stepwise protocol many international guideline . Uterine massage recommend treatment PPH . Initiate uterine massage soon excessive bleeding/uterine atony identify . Intravenous oxytocin alone still recommended uterotonic drug treatment PPH . If intravenous oxytocin unavailable bleed respond oxytocin , intravenous ergometrine , oxytocin-ergometrine fix dose prostaglandin drug ( include sublingual misoprostol , 600 mcg ) give . The use intrauterine balloon tamponade recommend treatment primary PPH due uterine atony woman respond uterotonics uterotonics available . Since 1983 , Goldrath publish evidence insert Foley catheter uterus inflate water could achieve tamponade , case series study suggest various uterine balloon tamponade ( UBT ) device may effective treat PPH . The study use various type UBT device , include condom catheter , Foley catheter , Sengstaken-Blakemore Esophageal Tube , Rusch Balloon , Bakri Uterine Balloon . In 2007 , systematic review treatment option PPH find 84 % success rate UBT significantly vary surgical treatment outcomes.The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) , Royal College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( RCOG ) , International Confederation Midwives ( ICM ) recognize balloon tamponade method could significantly improve management intractable PPH , especially low-resource area . In 2012 , WHO update guideline management PPH retain placenta include : `` The use intrauterine balloon tamponade recommend treatment PPH due uterine atony . This recommendation strong previous guideline . It use woman respond uterotonics uterotonics available . This procedure potentially avoid surgery appropriate await transfer higher-level facility '' .Furthermore , FIGO include UBT recommend second-line intervention treatment PPH update guideline issue 2012 . Bakri first publish concept intrauterine balloon technology management hemorrhage secondary placenta praevia-accreta caesarean section without bilateral hypo gastric arterial ligation.In 2006 , ACOG Practice Bulletin , publish American College Obstetricians Gynecologists , make mention Bakri postpartum balloon specifically tailor design enables conservative management uterine bleeding case uterine atony cause PPH . The idea use condom balloon tamponade first generate evaluate Bangladesh Sayeba Akhter fill need response high cost commercially available UBT device .</brief_summary>
