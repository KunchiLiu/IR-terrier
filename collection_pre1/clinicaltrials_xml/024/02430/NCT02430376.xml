	<brief_summary>Background : Pentalogy Cantrell ( POC ) syndrome involve many heart abnormality well large defect chest abdominal wall . This often result heart organs present outside body birth . Surgeons learn replace repair heart . Researchers want find possible gene change cause POC . To , want study data Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium ( PCGC ) Cohort . The PCGC collect data DNA sample people heart diseases family Objectives : - To find gene mutation people Pentalogy Cantrell ( POC ) relate syndrome . Eligibility : - PCGC data DNA sample open study public . Design : - Researchers study data PCGC . - The gene test do study consent original study . No new consent waiver request require . - The study last 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>dbGaP Protocol : Genetic Variants Associated With Pentalogy Cantrell</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol identify genetic mutation patient diagnosis Pentalogy Cantrell ( POC ) relate syndrome . We look exomic/genomic mutation could associate syndrome . We produce mouse model mutation gene encode nonmuscle myosin IIB exhibit problem ventral wall closure , include extrathoracic location heart ( ectopia cordis ) defect abdominal wall protrusion gut liver . These mouse severe defect heart brain , resemble human born POC , manifest abnormality , take special interest mutation nonmuscle myosin protein .</detailed_description>
