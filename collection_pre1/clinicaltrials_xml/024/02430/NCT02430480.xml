	<brief_summary>Background : - There several way treat prostate cancer . Researchers want see well certain kind imaging help detect prostate cancer . They also want see particular drug combination use surgery benefit people prostate cancer spread body ( non-metastatic ) . The combination androgen deprivation therapy enzalutamide . - The combination androgen deprivation therapy enzalutamide show make patient advanced ( metastatic disease ) live longer . The investigator want see use early increase cure rate surgery identify genetic molecular characteristic associate well outcomes . Objectives : - To develop good way detect prostate cancer pre-operative treatment . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year old non-metastatic prostate cancer . They must candidate radical prostatectomy . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . They scan X-rays . - Before start study drug , participant : - Vital sign take , medical history , blood test . - ECG heart test , patch stick skin . - Small piece tumor remove ( biopsy ) use image guidance MRI ultrasound . - 3T mpMRI . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . A probe insert &lt; TAB &gt; rectum . They scanner 60 minute , lie still . The scanner make loud knock &lt; TAB &gt; sound . Participants get earplug . - Participants take 2 study drug 6 month . - Enzalutamide take 4 pill day . - Androgen deprivation therapy give injection 2 time 6 month . - During 6 month , participant visit clinic monthly . They physical exam , vital sign , blood drawn . - After finish study drug , participant another 3T mpMRI . Then prostate removal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Multiparametric MRI Evaluate Intraprostatic Tumor Responses Androgen Resistance Patterns Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Most men diagnose prostate cancer present intermediate high-risk disease - Many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) curative strategy often unsuccessful - Treatment option typically involve radical prostatectomy ( RP ) radiation therapy ( RT ) combination androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) - Even cancer initially sensitive ADT , resistance ultimately emerge either clonal selection variety adaptive mechanism ( secondary resistance ) . - The recent introduction novel androgen pathway inhibitor offer opportunity potentially improve cure rate men intermediate high risk localize prostate cancer - There remain great need improve technique determine mechanisms treatment response resistance . Objectives : -To test feasibility multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) localization detection focal prostate cancer pre-operative treatment ADT enzalutamide . Eligibility : - Patients nonmetastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer intermediate high risk feature - Patients testosterone level great equal 100 ng/dL . - ECOG 0-1 . Design : - Patients treat ADT enzalutamide 6 month - Two 3T mpMRI endorectal examination ( One screen 6 month treatment ) - Screening biopsy ( MR/US guide ) sample - Standard care prostatectomy ( RP ) follow post treatment mpMRI - All tumor specimens undergo genomic analysis</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI Pathology Department Walter Reed Bethesda Must previously untreated ( definitive therapy ) prostate cancer intermediate high risk feature define : Intermediate risk : PSA level 10 20 ng/ml Gleason score 7 Stage T2b T2c High Risk : Gleason 8 high OR PSA great 20 time diagnosis OR Seminal vesicle involvement OR Possible ( MRI ) Extracapsular extension ( T3 disease ) Patients must eligible must plan undergo radical prostatectomy Patients must testosterone level great equal 100 ng/dL Men age great equal 18 year . Children exclude prostate cancer common pediatric population . Women eligible disease occur men . ECOG performance status less equal 1 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 150,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect enzalutamide develop human fetus unknown . For reason androgen receptor antagonists well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , male participant female partner child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) . Male participant use condom intercourse pregnant woman . Additionally , condom plus another effective method birth control recommend therapy 3 month treatment male participant intercourse woman reproductive potential . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Willingness undergo biopsy . Ability detect lesion within prostate MRI biopsy Willingness travel NIH followup visit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent ( past 28 day ) herbal medication ( within 1 day ) . Patients distant metastatic disease beyond N1 ( regional ) lymph nodes conventional imaging study ( CT , MRI Bone Scan ) . Patients receive prior therapy prostate cancer surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition enzalutamide agent use study . Clinically significant cardiac disease , e.g . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IIIIV ; uncontrolled angina , uncontrolled arrhythmia uncontrolled hypertension , myocardial infarction previous 6 month confirm electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Contraindication biopsy : Bleeding disorder PT/PTT great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal Artificial heart valve Contraindication MRI : Patients weigh weight limit scanner table Allergy MR contrast agent Patients pacemaker , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel injury implantable electronic device Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients know HIV eligible . These patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . In addition , patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy , potential pharmacokinetic interaction enzalutamide . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients know active treatment Hepatitis B C infection . Patients take medication strong inhibitor CYP3A4 PgP need remain medication . For current table Substrates , Inhibitors Inducers please access follow website : http : //www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm History seizure , include febrile seizure , loss consciousness , transient ischemic attack , condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior stroke , brain arteriovenous malformation , head trauma loss consciousness require hospitalization ) . Other medication use urinary symptom include 5alpha reductase inhibitor ( finasteride dutasteride ) alternative medication know alter PSA ( eg phytoestrogens saw palmetto ) take patient receive enzalutamide Patients malignancy within past 3 year study drug prostatectomy contraindication .</criteria>
