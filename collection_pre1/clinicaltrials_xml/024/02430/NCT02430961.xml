	<brief_summary>Donation Cardiac Death ( DCD ) increasingly common mechanism wish patient donate tissue organ follow death withdrawal life sustain therapy ( WLST ) . Unfortunately many potential DCD donor ultimately able donate significant emotional resource burden family , healthcare worker hospital . A tool allow accurate prediction time death follow WLST ( thus probability successful donation ) urgently need . Existing model useful due lack generalizability . Additionally , exist model include important factor recognize associated time death follow WLST . The investigator conduct prospective , observational cohort study patient consider DCD consent donation obtain evaluate association neurologic non-neurologic risk factor apnea , clinically important variable time death WLST , use data derive generalizable predictive model prediction time death follow WLST potential DCD donor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Donation cardiac death ( DCD ) method patient opportunity donate organ follow elective withdrawal life-sustaining therapy ( WLST ) . Often patient suffer catastrophic neurological injury although progressed brain death severe medical condition ongoing medical care consider non-beneficial . DCD become increasingly significant source organ transplantation time grow wait list organ shortfall . In order donate organ DCD , potential donor must progress death within certain time window withdrawal life sustain therapy . This timeframe vary usually less 120 minute follow WLST . Up 40 % potentially eligible DCD donor Ontario proceed organ procurement reason ( internal data Trillium Gift Life ) . The uncertainty variability potential successful organ procurement impact family , health care team organ retrieval team . It important emotional resource burden occur candidate reasonable likelihood eligible donate organ . The amount time elapse WLST circulatory arrest ( organ procurement ) important implication quality procure organ , organ unable transplant death . Finally , maintain organ procurement team operate room standby consumes valuable hospital resource remove human physical resource clinical duty . Several different prediction tool propose predict time death follow WLST potential DCD donor , none proven useful . To derive generalizable prediction tool necessary identify valid predictor common wide variety patient undergoing WLST . We propose addition feature predict apnea respiratory insufficiency development new predictive model . While previous study propose important variable prediction time death , hypothesize feature focus apnea ( neurologic non-neurologic ) independently predictive time death follow WLST . Neurological predictor apnea : The previous study consistently identify one two neurologic risk factor apnea associated time death . These risk factor evaluate isolation never rigorously study broad population combination . We wish evaluate follow neurological risk factor apnea previously find associated time death certain study : Glasgow Coma Scale , absence brain stem reflex ( corneal , pupil , cough , gag ) , control mode mechanical ventilation . Non-Neurological predictor apnea : No study date evaluate feature focus non-neurologic cause apnea . Given neurologic predictor apnea one consistent feature identify across study , hypothesize evaluate additional predictor apnea beyond neurologic cause could similarly association time death result profound hypoxia . While researcher evaluate contribution BMI weight , hypothesize addition definitive feature upper airway obstruction strengthen performance prediction tool . Neck circumference , absence endotracheal tube cuff leak , fluid balance , history obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) novel could improve operate characteristic prediction tool . Neck circumference find associate airway obstruction incorporate numerous prediction tool OSA . In study evaluate prevalence predictor upper airway obstruction follow stroke , neck circumference independently associate upper airway obstruction occur 24 hour follow acute stroke . In pooled analysis , absence cuff leak show predictive post extubation stridor 92 % specificity , thus suggest impend loss airway patency . Fluid balance also find associate post extubation failure . We conduct prospective , observational cohort study patient consider DCD consent donation obtain evaluate association neurologic non-neurologic risk factor apnea , clinically important variable time death WLST , use data derive generalizable predictive model prediction time death follow WLST potential DCD donor .</detailed_description>
