	<brief_summary>This study randomize control trial compare total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) unicompartmental knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) patient moderate anteromedial knee osteoarthritis . TKA patient receive Zimmer Persona ( Warsaw , IN ) posterior cruciate retain total knee arthroplasty , UKA patient receive Biomet Oxford ( Warsaw , IN ) mobile bear unicompartmental knee arthroplasty . Outcome measure include Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ) questionnaires , well biomechanics EMG analysis investigate gait lab . The investigator hypothesize post-operative UKA patient display high clinical score use WOMAC OKS questionnaire , superior biomechanical analysis measure . The investigator hypothesize biomechanics data assist understanding outcome score differential pre- post-operatively group , well between-groups . Total follow period two year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty Versus Total Knee Arthroplasty Patients With Anteromedial Osteoarthritis Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : Unicondylar knee arthroplasty versus total knee arthroplasty patient anteromedial osteoarthritis knee . Rationale : Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) offer several possible advantage total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . One important possible advantage overall high patient satisfaction UKA . Patients superior post-operative range motion `` natural-feeling '' knee . Previously , patient patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis ( PFJOA ) exclude UKA . However , recent study suggest excellent result achieve UKA despite pre-existing moderate PFJOA . This may broaden pre-defined inclusion criterion UKA . To date , biomechanical study directly compare UKA TKA perform . Biomechanical data could help explain outcome difference . This study aim compare clinical biomechanical outcome patient receive UKA versus TKA anteromedial OA presence moderate PFJOA . Hypothesis : We hypothesize post-operative UKA patient display high clinical score use WOMAC OKS questionnaire , superior biomechanical analysis measure . In compare healthy control , expect see UKA patient perform closely controls TKA patient , regard WOMAC , OKS , biomechanical score . We hypothesize UKA patient large change WOMAC OKS score pre- post-operatively TKA patient . Study design : This study randomize control trial . Eligible patient : anteromedial compartment osteoarthritis ( OA ) intact anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) clinical test alignment radiograph ; normal mild moderate PFJOA ; angular deformity &lt; 15 degree passively correctible neutral ; flexion contracture &lt; 5 degree ; BMI &lt; 40 ; age 40-80 year . We exclude patient : severe PFJOA ; history previous surgery affect knee ( exclude simple meniscectomy ) ; inflammatory arthropathy ; previous contralateral knee replacement surgery major ligament reconstruction surgery . Patients stratify base PFJOA status . They randomize use StudyTRAX ( ScienceTrax , Macon , GA ) online system one two treatment arm : UKA ( n=19 ) TKA ( n=19 ) . The control group match study group characteristic , recruit University Calgary Alberta Hip Knee Clinic ( AHKC ) . UKA patient receive mobile bearing , Oxford UKA ( Biomet , Warsaw , IN ) utilize microplasty instrumentation . TKA patient receive posterior cruciate-retaining TKA unresurfaced patella utilize Persona instrumentation ( Zimmer , Warsaw , IN ) . Clinical outcome assess pre-operatively , post-operatively 6 week , 3 month , 1 year , 2 year utilize WOMAC OKS questionnaire . Radiographs include weight bearing anteroposterior ( AP ) , AP , lateral skyline view , valgus stress view . These standard treatment AHKC , take preoperatively 2 day ( non-weightbearing view ) , 3 month , 1 year postoperative appointment . Interpretation treat surgeons.Biomechanical assessment include gait analysis electromyography ( EMG ) , do Clinical Movement Analysis Laboratory ( CMAL ) McCaig Institute . This measure pre-operatively one year post-operatively . A healthy , age , gender weight match control group recruit establish deviation patient group healthy norm . Clinical biomechanical outcome assess control group . The analysis plan include descriptive analysis , univariate analysis explore between-group difference repeated-measures ANOVA ass statistically significant change WOMAC , OKS , biomechanical outcome time within group . T-test &amp; Pearson chi-square test compute continuous variable categorical variable , accordingly . A multivariate linear regression analysis may perform reveal relationship variable , enable u control baseline variable interest . Significance work : No study date investigate whether UKA TKA favorable patient moderate PFJOA , meet traditional criterion UKA . Additionally , biomechanical data exists area . If patient receive UKA demonstrate similar ( well ) clinical biomechanical outcome receive TKA , would suggest UKA could offer much great number patient , less invasive procedure , potential health system saving . It anticipate biomechanical data , combination clinical research data , help good understand difference two surgical approach .</detailed_description>
