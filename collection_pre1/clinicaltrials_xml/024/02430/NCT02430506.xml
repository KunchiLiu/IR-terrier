	<brief_summary>The available live tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) provide incomplete protection pulmonary tuberculosis . For unknown reason , BCG revaccination `` booster '' , toxic , provide much additional protection . AERAS-402 present tuberculosis antigens set new , live , replication deficient adenovirus vaccine may increase T cell immunity thus protection tuberculosis . Since BCG-vaccinated individual population AERAS-402 might indicate , AERAS-402 administer individual Kenya already vaccinate BCG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity AERAS-402 Administered HIV-negative , BCG-vaccinated , QFT ( + ) ( - ) Adults Without Evidence TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study conduct double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study 20 healthy adult subject . The study enroll 10 subject QFT-G positive screen 10 subject QFT-G negative screening . Within QFT-G group , subject randomized receive AERAS-402 placebo ratio 4:1 . One dose level AERAS-402 ( 3 x 10^10 vp ) investigate study . All subject receive single dose study vaccine ( AERAS-402 placebo ) Study Day 0 second dose study vaccine ( AERAS-402 placebo ) Study Day 56 . All vaccination administer IM injection deltoid muscle . The sample size select adequate preliminary safety evaluation initial immunogenicity review phase study , rather statistical reason . If serious adverse event observe 16 subject receive AERAS-402 , upper bound 95 % confidence interval rate serious adverse event occurrence 17.1 percent . The selection AERAS-402 dose level evaluation study derive animal study base safety profile complete ongoing clinical study U.S. South Africa.The total duration follow-up 182 day subject total eleven follow-up clinic visit . The study plan single site Kisumu , Kenya .</detailed_description>
