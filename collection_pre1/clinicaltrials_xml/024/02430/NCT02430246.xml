Following treatment another smear take accord patient divide 2 research group : ( 1 ) Assessing effectiveness probiotic formula prevent AVF re-infection ( secondary infection ) - group include patient normal vaginal flora follow antibiotic administration . ( 2 ) Assessing effectiveness probiotic formula eradicate AVF - group include patient persistent AVF follow antibiotic administration ( first second line ) . In group patient divide research group receive probiotic formula UREX PLUS ( contain L. rhamnosus GR-1and L. reuteri RC-14 ) control group receive placebo twice day 36.6 week gestation .
