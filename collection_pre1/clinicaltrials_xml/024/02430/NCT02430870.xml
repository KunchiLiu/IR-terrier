	<detailed_description>The drug evaluate study TAK-648 treatment T2DM . This study consist 2 part : ( 1 ) multiple ascend dos participant T2DM treat stable dose metformin , ( 2 ) multiple ascend dos healthy participant Japanese descent . Part 1 study consist 2 multiple dose treatment cohort ( Cohorts 1-2 designate P1C1 P1C2 ) dose sequentially escalate order . The projected dos TAK-648 Part 1 0.15 0.35 mg TAK-648 , may adjust high low , additional cohort may add , base available safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data . All cohort Part 1 consist 8 ( 2 placebo ) T2DM participant . Part 2 study consist 3 multiple dose treatment cohort ( Cohorts 1-3 designate P2C1 , P2C2 P2C3 ) healthy participant Japanese descent dose sequentially escalate order . The projected dos TAK-648 choose Part 2 0.05 , 0.15 0.35 mg TAK-648 , may adjust high low base available safety PK data . All cohort Part 2 consist 8 ( 2 placebo ) healthy participant Japanese descent . Additional cohort may recruit study necessary well evaluate safety , tolerability , PK , and/or PD parameter .</detailed_description>
