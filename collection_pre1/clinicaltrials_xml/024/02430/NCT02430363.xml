	<brief_title>Evaluation Of The Treatment Effectiveness Of Glioblastoma / Gliosarcoma Through The Suppression Of The PI3K/Akt Pathway In Compared With MK-3475</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody direct human cell surface receptor PD-1 ( program death-1 program cell death-1 ) potential immunopotentiating activity . Upon administration , pembrolizumab bind PD-1 , inhibitory signal receptor express surface activate T cell , block bind activation PD-1 ligand , result activation T-cell-mediated immune response tumor cell . The ligands PD-1 include PD-L1 , express antigen presenting cell ( APCs ) overexpressed certain cancer cell , PD-L2 , primarily express APCs . Activated PD-1 negatively regulate T-cell activation suppression PI3K/Akt pathway . This study identify effectiveness oral inhibitor PI3K / Akt pathway comparison MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) .</detailed_description>
