	<brief_summary>Title : `` Role biomarkers predict contrast-induced acute kidney injury critically ill patient : prospective observational study '' Objective : To analyse role plasma urinary biomarkers ( Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , Cystatin C Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) predict contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) critically ill patient . Summary project : Acute deterioration renal function intravenous administration radiocontrast medium , i.e . increase serum creatinine concentration 0.5 mg/dl 25 % baseline within 48 hour , refer contrast-induced kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) . The increase number diagnostic procedure require radiographic contrast parallel increase incidence CI-AKI . CI-AKI described third common cause new AKI hospitalize patient . Occurrence CI-AKI report 55 % high risk patient like presence pre-existing chronic renal dysfunction , diabetes , hypertension , chronic heart failure , advanced age , volume depletion , use concurrent nephrotoxic medication . These risk factor CI-AKI common critically ill patient . Recently , different urinary serum protein intensively investigate possible biomarkers early diagnosis AKI , include Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , Cystatin C Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM 1 ) . At present , scarcity prospective study CI-AKI role biomarkers critically ill medical medical-surgical mixed ICU patient . The investigator plan enroll 100 ICU patient 2 year , require compute tomography ( CT ) scan parenteral administration iodinate radiographic contrast diagnostic purpose decide clinician treatment patient . In prospective observation study , investigator want analyse role plasma urinary biomarkers predict CI-AKI critically ill patient . Key Words : acute kidney injury , radiographic contrast , critically ill , biomarker</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Biomarkers Predicting Contrast-induced Acute Kidney Injury Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study support cited literature : Role biomarkers AKI establish different clinical setting , early diagnosis also make prognosis . There study contrast-induced AKI , mainly patient undergo cardiac catheterization . Due scarcity prospective study clinically important issue critically ill patient , need propose study . The investigator study analyse role plasma urinary biomarkers ( Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , Cystatin C Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) predict CI-AKI critically ill patient The relevance expect outcome propose study : With study , investigator able know predictive value biomarkers predict CI-AKI critically ill patient . Preliminary work do far : No systematic study far critically ill medical-surgical ICU patient . Definition Contrast-induced acute kidney injury : Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) define rise serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dl baseline ( contrast exposure ) value within 48 hour administration radiographic contrast Work plan methodology : This prospective observational study know role biomarkers CI-AKI critically ill patient . Patients include 2 intensive care unit ( ICU ) : 1 . ICU Department Critical Care Medicine , ; 2 . ICU Department Neurosurgery . All adult critically ill patient consider inclusion study , require contrast-enhanced CT scan organ system decide treat clinician also meet study criterion predefined . After get write informed consent patient close relative participate study , patient include study . There intervention study . Treatment patient continue per treat clinician . Transportation patient CT scan accompany senior resident staff nurse ; relevant monitoring vitals do per ICU protocol . Sample collection : Sample collect informed write consent . At baseline , contrast exposure , 5 ml blood 5 ml urine collect . Similar amount collect 04 h , 24 h 48 h contrast exposure . Collected sample ( plasma urine ) store temperature -80 degree centigrade deep freezer till analysis . Data collection : Demographic clinical characteristic ICU patient fulfil inclusion criterion collect along relevant laboratory test do patient management . ICU prognostication score , i.e. , Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment ( SOFA ) score also record . Contrast type volume note . Fluid balance last 24 hour , use nephrotoxic drug also note . Intervention : None . Outcome : The primary outcome measure development contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) , define rise plasma creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dl baseline ( contrast exposure ) value within 48 hour administration radiographic contrast . Laboratory method : Samples analyse plasma urinary creatinine study biomarkers contrast exposure well 04 h , 24 h 48 h contrast exposure . Biomarker , Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , Cystatin C Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM 1 ) plasma urine , analyse commercially available ELISA kit ( RnD ) per manufacturer instruction . Urinary biomarker normalize per urine creatinine value sample .</detailed_description>
