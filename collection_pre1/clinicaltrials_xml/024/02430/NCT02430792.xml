	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common malignancy men . Three million currently live United States disease number expect rise four million 2024 . Most live many year disease experience significant morbidity due disease progression treatment toxicity . Exercise show improve QoL reduce treatment toxicity . Moreover epidemiological evidence suggest physical activity improve survival . Football show induce positive effect body composition bone marker subgroup prostate cancer patient , receive androgen deprivation therapy . The objective examine effectiveness football prostate cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PLAN FOR THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES This plan prepare laid forward follow-up conduct . The plan delineate analyse FC PC trial ; deviation lay forward discuss final publication . The primary statistical analysis target effect prostate cancer ( PCa ) specific Quality Life ( QoL ) treatment policy offer community base football men prostate cancer . In particular , patient analyse treatment group randomly allocate respect intention-to-treat principle ( ITT ) . The appropriate method address effect depend assumption make miss data ( drop-outs ) . Our main analysis valid miss random assumption also present sensitivity analyse robust non-ignorable pattern among patient incomplete data . Per protocol analysis perform estimate de jure effect treatment compliant patient . The `` per protocol '' population define trial participant intervention group attend football intervention least 12 time first 12 week 24 time 6 month intervention period . Significance test two-sided maximal type I error risk 5 % . To address problem multiple comparison secondary analysis several outcome test multiple constracts extract statistical model p-values adjust use step-down Bonferrroni method Holm ( Holm 1979 ) appropriate modern alternative . Trial profile A CONSORT diagram show trial participant flow . Number screen patient fulfil inclusion criterion trial subject include analyse together reason exclusion trial subject report . Primary outcome The continuous outcome score FACT-P calculate use official scoring guideline . As described score guideline miss item prorate multiply sum subscale number item subscale , divide number item answer . This do 50 % item answer subscales 80 % answered total questionnaire . The change score total FACT-P 12 week calculate subtract total 12 week score respective trial participant 's baseline score . Analysis covariance use ( Vickers Altman 2001 ) , group ADT-status set factor , response change FACT-P covariates age baseline score . The result present least square mean ( LSMEANS ) differences two group 95 % confidence interval p-values . Secondary outcome include safety outcome Changes baseline 6 month LBM , BMC , BMD , total body fat mass analyse manner primary outcome . QoL , Functional Well-Being Physical Activity ( base MET value derive IPAQ questionnaire ) measure baseline , 12 week 6 month analyse use mixed model repeat measurement . Changes baseline 12 week 6 month treat response , model include fix effect factor : group , ADT , sample time interaction , analysis adjust age baseline value . The correlation measurement patient model use random effect patient . Safety outcomes list group number fracture fall result seek medical assessment compare across group use Fisher 's exact test . Subgroup analyse plan report patient treated androgen deprivation therapy therefore result give overall treatment effect subgroup obtain stratify level accord androgen deprivation therapy . To verify credibility subgroup analysis , apply criterion propose Sun colleague ( Sun et al . 2012 ) , i.e . subgroup variable baseline characteristic , stratification factor , specify priori include small number analysis . Outline figure table The first figure main publication CONSORT flow diagram . The second figure illustrate change primary secondary outcome , except safety outcome , 12 week 6 month , accord treatment group . A third figure display mean curve primary outcome patient different group accord pattern miss data . In particular , mean curve show separately completers patient miss data one assessment time . The figure use guide type sensitivity analyse perform adjust result potentially deviate pattern patient incomplete observation . Tables follow order ; first table delineate trial subject characteristic , secondly table showing change primary secondary outcome 12 week 6 month . Thirdly safety outcome present accord group type .</detailed_description>
