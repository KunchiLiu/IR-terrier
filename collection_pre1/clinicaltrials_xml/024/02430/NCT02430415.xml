	<brief_title>Laryngoscope-assisted Lightwand Intubation Cervical Spine Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical practice , investigator occasionally experienced difficulty lightwand intubation patient cervical spine instability manual in-line stabilization intubation hinders free movement lightwand advancement , withdrawal , scoop oral cavity . For reason , jaw thrust often used secure enough space free movement lightwand oral cavity traditional lightwand intubation technique . A recent study show laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation provide successful intubation first attempt less scooping movement traditional lightwand intubation facilitate free movement lightwand oral cavity patient cervical immobilization intubation cervical spine surgery . In laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation technique , direct laryngoscope may provide sufficient space free movement lightwand oral cavity without jaw thrust , result cervical spine movement . However , effect laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation technique cervical spine motion investigate yet .</detailed_description>
