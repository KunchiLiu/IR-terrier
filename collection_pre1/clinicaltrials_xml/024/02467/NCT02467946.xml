	<brief_summary>Treatment outcome ABVD elderly patient remain inferior adult . Moreover , Bleomycin-induced lung toxicity elderly report high 46 % . For reason , question arise whether ABVD could still consider standard treatment HL patient age &gt; 60 . Regimens contain alkylators CHOP prove even superior ABVD , 3-y PFS 67 % . Frontline treatment advanced-stage HL Brentuximab Vedotin ( BV ) association AVD ( Doxorubicin , Vinblastine , Dacarbazine ) prove active pioneer study , report preliminary result phase 1 multicentre trial , percentage patient achieve CR high 92 % . For reason investigator decide test association alkylator innovative mechanism action safe toxicity profile elderly Bendamustine ( Be ) BV untreated elderly HL patient . The combination BV Be , investigate study , might represent innovative treatment alternative HL patient older 60 year age , especially ABVD chemotherapy , current standard front-line treatment , suitable . However , even ABVD give upfront treatment elderly HL patient , associate substantial dose reduction , treatment delay , toxicity , treatment-related mortality , treatment outcomes remain much inferior obtain young patient . This drug association expect safe , well-tolerated demonstrate high efficiency compare ABVD . In set , expect therapy could offer large majority elderly patient full treatment completion reach 80 % patient . Thus , aim study assess safety efficacy association .</brief_summary>
