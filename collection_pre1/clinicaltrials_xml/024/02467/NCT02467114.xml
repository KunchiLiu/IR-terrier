According current model , visual attentional control base two separate group brain region , call brain network . These network control different attentional aspect ( e.g. , spatial/non-spatial attention ) interact . A disruption interaction lead attentional disorder hemispatial neglect . Patients hemispatial neglect difficulty direct attention leave visual field act though latter exist . To date , interaction two attentional network poorly understood . The aim study consist clarify different aspect interaction influence visual perception healthy participant patient hemispatial neglect . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) principal method apply study . TMS painless non-invasive method , activity brain area influence temporarily . This allow u draw conclusion regard function interaction brain area . This study design significant impact basic understanding attentional control human brain benefit comprehension treatment attentional disorder , hemispatial neglect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Attention define preparedness rapidly accurately respond stimulus come investigator environment effectively select relevant irrelevant information . Attention complex cognitive function base multiple component . A recent model postulate attentional control brain base two discrete neural network . The ventral ( temporo-parietal - ventral frontal ) network control non-spatial aspect attention , alertness vigilance , stimulus detection reorientation hemifields . This network lateralize towards right hemisphere plays role 'circuit-breaker ' . The dorsal ( superior parietal - dorsal frontal ) network control spatial attentional shift , largely top-down driven , substantially overlap eye movement control . This network functionally lateralize , hemisphere contain dynamic topographical map contralateral space . Moreover , dorsal network two hemisphere compete direct attention contralateral hemispace , thereby exert reciprocal inhibition . Hemispatial neglect - failure detect , orient , respond stimulus locate contralesional side space - interpreted term pathological change interaction two attentional network . Neglect common cerebral lesion right hemisphere , usually affect ventral attentional network . The structurally intact right dorsal network would thus receive weaken input right ventral network . The ensue imbalance inhibition dorsal network two hemisphere would result rightward bias attentional allocation , typically observed hemispatial neglect . However , little known regard interaction ventral dorsal attentional network influence perception , great part evidence acquire correlational approach . The aim study elucidate different aspect interaction investigate influence spatial non-spatial attentional performance visual perception . Objective A first objective consist elucidate anatomical structure ventral dorsal attentional network interact . A second objective concern interplay dorsal ventral attentional network influence visual perception , particular case visual stimuli ambiguous . Methods Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) principal method apply study . TMS non-invasive , painless method able influence cortical area direct attention interference approach thus establish causal relationship . Furthermore , TMS , combination measurement motor evoke potential ( MEP ) , allow assessment excitability cortico-cortical circuit .</detailed_description>
