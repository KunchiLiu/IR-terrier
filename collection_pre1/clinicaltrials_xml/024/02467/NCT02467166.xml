	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine use Circa™ temperature monitoring system ablation procedure reduce risk esophageal lesion damage . Esophageal lesion cause ablation could later develop potentially fatal atrio-esophageal fistula , hole upper chamber heart esophagus . Although development atrio-esophageal fistula follow atrial fibrillation ablation extremely rare , complication severe potentially life-threatening . Therefore , monitor esophageal temperature adopt prevent development esophageal lesion . The Circa™ temperature monitoring system allow cardiac electrophysiologists monitor thereby limit temperature well duration ablation esophagus throughout procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dr. Gregory Feld , M.D . conduct research study find short-term effect esophagus leave atrial ablation ( guide Circa™ esophageal temperature monitoring system ) . The financial supporter study Circa Scientific , LLC . When investigator perform radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) UCSD , investigator routinely use Circa™ temperature monitor system prevent damage esophagus . For study , patient receive esophagoscopy , procedure flexible tube camera insert mouth esophagus . The esophagoscopy conduct next day follow ablation procedure examine line esophagus possible lesion damage . Patients ask participate study schedule ablation atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . There approximately 40 participant study University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) Cardiovascular Center . The use Circa™ temperature monitoring system use standard ablation procedure UCSD use whether patient decide participate study . Using esophagoscopy , study evaluate lining esophagus , swallow tube throat stomach , day follow atrial fibrillation ablation use endoscope , flexible tube equip camera . Patients enrol study proceed standard care ablation procedure treatment atrial fibrillation . There change ablation part research study . The Circa™ temperature monitor system use throughout ablation standard clinical care patient receive AF ablation UCSD . For research purpose , patient undergo esophagoscopy , endoscopic evaluation esophagus , next day follow atrial fibrillation ablation . This procedure take 40-45 minute , involve insert flexible probe ( tube ) camera , throat esophagus ( swallow tube ) , inspect damage ( thermal lesion ) cause ablation procedure . Following procedure , patient monitor usual fashion procedure treatment unit ( PTU ) , standard care follow AF ablation . Ablation patient discharge hospital standard manner esophagoscopy ask schedule follow-up appointment follow ablation , standard care . There research follow-up study . If reason patient complete ablation esophagoscopy procedure , patient withdrawn study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must atrial fibrillation schedule AF ablation , Circa esophageal temperature probe use guide ablation . Must give write informed consent Patient 's refusal participate study Any know esophageal disease prior injury would preclude esophagoscopy Any complication occur AF ablation would result esophagoscopy add significant risk patient beyond know potential risk esophagoscopy Prior AF ablation</criteria>
