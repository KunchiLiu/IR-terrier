	<criteria>1 . Male female adult age ≥ 40 year write informed consent obtain prior studyrelated procedure . 2 . Patients diagnosis COPD least 12 month screen visit ( accord GOLD document updated 2014 ) . 3 . Current smoker exsmokers quit smoke least 6 month prior screen visit , smoke history least 10 pack year [ packyears = ( number cigarette per day x number year ) /20 ] . 4 . A postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict normal value postbronchodilator force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) /forced vital capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 0.7 least 1015 min 4 puff ( 4 x 100 μg ) salbutamol pMDI . If criterion meet screening , test repeat randomisation . 5 . A documented history least one exacerbation 12 month precede screen visit . COPD exacerbation define accord following : `` A sustained worsening patient 's condition ( dyspnoea , cough and/or sputum production/purulence ) , stable state beyond normal daytoday variation , acute onset necessitates change regular medication patient underlie COPD include prescription systemic corticosteroid and/or antibiotic need hospitalization '' . Also document visit emergency department due COPD exacerbation consider acceptable fulfil criterion . 6 . Patients double therapy least 2 month prior screen visit either : 1. inhale corticosteroids/longacting β2agonist combination ( fixed free ) , without regular use shortacting muscarinic antagonist ( regular use mean 2 puff 4 time per day least ) 2. inhaled corticosteroids/longacting muscarinic antagonist free combination , without regular use shortacting β2agonist ( regular use mean 2 puff 4 time per day least ) 3 . Inhaled longacting β2agonist inhale longacting muscarinic antagonist 4 . Patients monotherapy longacting muscarinic antagonist least 2 month prior screen . 7 . Symptomatic patient screen CAT score ≥10 . 8 . A cooperative attitude ability use correctly inhaler . 9 . A cooperative attitude ability use correctly daily electronic Diary ( eDiary ) . 1 . Pregnant lactate woman woman physiologically capable become pregnant ( i.e . woman childbearing potential ) UNLESS willing use one method contraception define protocol 2 . Patients current clinical diagnosis asthma physicianjudged need inhaled oral corticosteroid therapy 3 . Patients require use follow medication : 1 . A course systemic steroid longer 3 day COPD exacerbation 4 week prior screen 2 . A course antibiotic COPD exacerbation longer 7 day 4 week prior screen 3. phosphodiesterase4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor 4 week prior screen 4 . Use antibiotic low respiratory tract infection ( e.g pneumonia ) 4 week prior screen 4 . COPD exacerbation require prescription systemic corticosteroid and/or antibiotic hospitalization runin period 5 . Patients treat noncardio selective βblockers month precede screen visit runin period . Those patient may enter study nonselective βblockers withdrawal and/or cardio selective βblockers intake least 10 day randomization 6 . Patients treat longacting antihistamine unless take stable regimen least 2 month prior screen maintain constant study , take nata ( PRN ) . 7 . Patients require long term ( least 12 hour daily ) oxygen therapy chronic hypoxemia . 8 . Known respiratory disorder COPD may impact efficacy study drug accord investigator 's judgment 9 . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular condition 10 . Patients atrial fibrillation ( AF ) : 1 . Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 2 . Persistent : AF episode either last longer 7 day require termination cardioversion , either drug direct current cardioversion ( DCC ) within 6 month screen 3 . Long stand Persistent define continuous atrial fibrillation diagnose less 6 month without rhythm control strategy 4 . Permanent : least 6 month rest ventricular rate ≥ 100/min controlled rate control strategy ( i.e. , selective βblocker , calcium channel blocker , pacemaker placement , digoxin ablation therapy ) 11 . An abnormal clinically significant 12lead ECG may impact safety patient accord investigator 's judgement Patients whose electrocardiogram ( ECG12 lead ) show QT Interval Corrected Fridericia Correction Formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 m male QTcF &gt; 470 m female screen visit eligible ( applicable patient pacemaker ) 12 . Medical diagnosis narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction opinion investigator would prevent use anticholinergic agent 13 . History hypersensitivity anticholinergic , β2agonist , corticosteroid excipients contain formulation use trial may raise contraindication impact efficacy study drug accord investigator 's judgement 14 . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality indicate significant unstable concomitant disease may impact efficacy safety study drug accord investigator 's judgement 15 . Patients hypokalaemia ( serum potassium level &lt; 3.5 milliequivalent per liter ( mEq/L ) ( 3.5 mmol/L ) ) uncontrolled hyperkalaemia accord investigator 's judgment 16 . Unstable concurrent disease : e.g . uncontrolled hyperthyroidism , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus endocrine disease ; significant hepatic impairment ; significant renal impairment ; uncontrolled gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . active peptic ulcer ) ; uncontrolled neurological disease ; uncontrolled haematological disease ; uncontrolled autoimmune disorder , may impact efficacy safety study drug accord investigator 's judgment . 17 . Patients history malignancy likely result significant disability likely require significant medical surgical intervention within next six month ( V1 ) malignancy currently undergo radiation therapy chemotherapy 18 . History alcohol abuse and/or substance/drug abuse within 12 month prior screen visit 19 . Participation another clinical trial investigation drug receive less 8 week prior screen visit</criteria>
