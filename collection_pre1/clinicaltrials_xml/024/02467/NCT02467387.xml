	<criteria>1 . Males females ≥18 year age 2 . LVEF ≤35 % echocardiogram within 12 month randomization undergo MRI 3 . Screening cardiac MRI baseline : Ejection fraction ≤40 % No significant hyper enhancement MRI scan opinion central image lab reviewer 4 . Patients nonischemic heart failure etiology , document absent nonobstructive coronary artery disease xray angiography coronary compute tomography 5 . Patients history heart failure treat least three month GDMT 6 . NYHA class IIIII symptoms 7 . Ability understand provide sign informed consent 8 . Reasonable expectation patient receive standard posttreatment care attend schedule safety followup visit 1 . Pregnant nursing woman childbearing age use effective method contraception 2 . History stroke within 3 month 3 . Cardiac surgery within 3 month prior randomization likelihood requirement procedure study period 4 . Current ICD CRT implantation plan within 6 month infusion 5 . Presence clinically significant , uncorrected valvular heart disease , hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy , active myocarditis , uncontrolled hypertension 6 . History cardiac arrest lifethreatening arrhythmia within 3 month 7 . Treatment parenteral inotropic agent within 1 month randomization 8 . Anticipated cardiac transplantation within 1 year 9 . Illness heart failure life expectancy le 1 year 10 . Received experimental drug device within 30 day randomization 11 . Left ventricular assist device implantation plan next 6 month 12 . Patients complex congenital heart disease 13 . Uncontrolled seizure disorder 14 . Presence immune deficiency 15 . Clinically significant hematologic , hepatic , renal impairment determine screen clinical laboratory test : Liver disease = ALT AST &gt; 3x normal , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; 2x normal ) Renal disease = estimate glomerular filtration rate assess MDRD formula &lt; 30 ml/min Hematologic = Unexplained leukocytosis &gt; 10 hemoglobin &lt; 9gm/dl 16 . Presence clinicallysignificant medical condition , psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality , judgment investigator sponsor participation study would pose safety risk subject 17 . Inability comply condition protocol 18 . Malignancy within previous five year , except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , provide neither infiltrate sclerosing , carcinoma situ cervix 19 . Active myocarditis early postpartum cardiomyopathy ( within six month ) . 20 . Systemic corticosteroid , cytostatics , immunosuppressive drug therapy ( cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , cyclosporine , azathioprine , etc . ) , DNA deplete cytotoxic drug take within four week prior study treatment 21 . Porphyria 22 . Allergy sodium citrate `` caine '' type local anesthetic 23 . Any contraindication gadolinium use MRI 24 . Patient schedule hospice care 25 . Clinically relevant abnormal finding clinical history , physical examination , ECG , laboratory test screen assessment would interfere objective study would preclude safe completion study . Abnormal finding could include : know HIV infection immunodeficiency state , chronic active viral infection ( hepatitis B C ) , acute systemic infection ( defined patient undergo treatment antibiotic ) , gastrointestinal tract bleeding , severe acute concomitant illness injury 26 . Any medical , social , geographical factor would make unlikely patient could comply study procedure ( e.g. , alcohol abuse , lack permanent residence , severe depression , disorientation , distant location , noncompliance )</criteria>
