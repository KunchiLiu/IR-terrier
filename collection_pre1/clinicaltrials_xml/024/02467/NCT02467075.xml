Subjects schedule clinically indicate CT abdomen and/or pelvis evaluate suspect intra-abdominal infection . Subjects randomize receive either weight-based low-osmolality iodinate contrast material saline . The primary outcome measure incidence stage II AKI AKIN criterion . Secondary outcome measure include AKI definition ( stage I AKI , traditional CI-AKI definition ) , hospital length stay , 30-day readmission rate , number additional percutaneous intervention within 30 day , number additional CT examination within 30 day , 30-day mortality rate . All subject receive minimum 1 mL/kg/hr ( max : 125 mL/hr ) volume expansion least three hour pre three hour post-CT .</detailed_description>
