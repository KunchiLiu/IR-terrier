	<brief_summary>The goal Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Registry ( NPWTR ) Wounds provide real world patient data electronic health record submit meet Stage 2 Meaningful Use order understand effectiveness safety various NPWT device method among patient chronic wound ulcer . Randomized , control trial establish product efficacy routinely exclude patient co-morbid condition common patient see usual clinical practice thus result Randomized Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) tend non-generalizable . Little known effectiveness NPWT among typical patient . Patient registry also ideal assess long term safety issue device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Registry ( NPWTR ) ) Wounds Ulcers provide comparative effectiveness data NPWT include different NPWT device , safety data NPWT ( e.g . frequency adverse event experience typical NPWT patient ) . NPWT promote wound heal apply vacuum special seal dressing . The mechanical micro-deformation wound bed response suction show stimulate accelerate formation new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) . The continuous vacuum remove fluid reduces edema , thereby increase tissue oxygen level . The vacuum may apply continuously intermittently , depend type wound treat clinical objective . Depending NPWT device , variety dressing place wound bed conjunction NPWT , variety suction pressure may apply . The diversity NPWT device rate become available clinical use make impossible perform randomize control trial compare effectiveness one another . Effectiveness real world patient best current option understand role NPWT wound heal . Hospital base outpatient wound center participate US Wound Registry agree provide data part quality initiatives include participation PQRS , meet Stage 2 Meaningful use criterion . The NPWTR subset USWR ( Chronic Disease Registry ) data . All patient data participate outpatient clinic transmit USWR data available benchmarking , PQRS initiatives . Data use comparative effectiveness research HIPAA de-identified .</detailed_description>
