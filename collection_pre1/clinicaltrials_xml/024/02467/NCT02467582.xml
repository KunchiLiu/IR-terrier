	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common malignancy woman men responsible almost 10 % cancer death . Despite complete removal tumor use adjuvant chemotherapy , 25 % patient stage II colon cancer 50 % patient stage III disease suffer recurrence , associate poor prognosis . Several retrospective observation document favorable effect long-term intake oral aspirin prevention colorectal cancer different clinical situation . Regular intake aspirin diagnosis colorectal cancer may also associate low risk colorectal cancer−specific overall mortality . Two recent publication prestigious medical journal provide retrospective evidence patient PIK3CA-mutated colon cancer may derive substantial benefit daily oral aspirin . Both analysis show roughly 85 % reduction risk tumor relapse compare patient take aspirin . However , potential selection bias retrospective analysis exclude certainty . These extremely interesting intriguing finding must confirm randomize controlled trial potentially change clinical practice . The trial objective demonstrate statistically significant clinically relevant disease-free survival benefit stage II III PIK3CA mutate colon cancer patient take daily adjuvant aspirin 3 year . Patients resect colon cancer stage II stage III bearing somatic mutation exon 9 20 PIK3CA 2:1 randomize daily adjuvant aspirin 100 mg versus placebo total 3 year disease recurrence , patient death withdrawal consent , whichever occur first . Patients follow 10 year date surgery . The intake aspirin placebo independent adjuvant chemotherapy , impact indication give ( give ) adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
