	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare standard manual robotically control catheter ablation cavo-tricuspid isthmus ( CTI ) treatment atrial flutter . Ablation CTI standard treatment patient history atrial flutter , undergo ablation atrial fibrillation . Both manual robotic catheter manipulation use standard clinical practice The University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) ablation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Amigo Robotic System Ablation Cavo-Tricuspid Isthmus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dr. Gregory Feld , M.D . conduct research study find effect use Amigoâ„¢ Robotic System ablation cavo-tricuspid isthmus ( flutter isthmus ) catheter stability ( stabilization catheter procedure order prevent movement dislodgement ) use combination contact force ( measurement force apply catheter tip tissue ablation procedure ) , location , duration measurement ablation atrial flutter circuit . Published study indicate robotic catheter manipulation safe , may reduce patient physician x-ray exposure , ablation procedure time . Measuring contact force also show improve short-term long-term procedure success . However , research ablation CTI specifically , limited . This randomized study compare robotic catheter manipulation use Amigo Robotic System manual catheter manipulation ablation CTI measure include catheter stability , contact force , procedure time , fluoroscopy ( X-ray ) time . The ablation procedure standard care , however , patient choose enroll study randomize one two group : either manual robotic catheter manipulation . Throughout procedure , research personnel collect information procedure include measurement contact force , catheter stability , procedure duration , fluoroscopy ( X-ray ) time . If , addition ablation cavo-tricuspid isthmus atrial flutter , patient schedule undergo ablation leave atrium atrial fibrillation leave atrial flutter , perform subsequently standard manner , consider part research . Ablation CTI generally take 45-60 minute regardless technique use manipulation catheter . The patient 's participation study last one day , length study procedure . There follow associate study . All subject receive standard care treatment follow ablation .</detailed_description>
