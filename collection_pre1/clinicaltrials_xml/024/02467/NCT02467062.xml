	<brief_summary>The aim investigator implement 4D FLOW MRI technique clinical set evaluate blood flow pattern wall sheer stress patient aortic and/or aortic valve disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation Non-size Markers Derived From 4D Flow MRI Patients With Aortic Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , time replacement ascend aorta solely base aortic diameter concomitant valvular dysfunction recent ESC guideline propose surgical intervention ascend aortic aneurysm patient maximal aortic diameter â‰¥ 55mm , regardless etiology . On contrary , recent publication Rylski et al show dissection occur diameter small 55 mm . Several publictions show flow profile wall sheer stress derive 4D flow MRI significantly different valve morphology , type aneurysm ( tubular diffuse enlargement ) pre postoperative patient . Clinical implementation 4D flow may enable u stratify patient aortic and/or aortic valve disease , especially regard risk rupture . The patient aortic/aortic valve disease refer 4D flow MRI contrast-enhanced angiografie aorta clinic . Phase 1 : 6 healty adult volunteer scan prior scan patient setting would optimise 4D flow MRI contrast give . Phase 2 : 30 patient either schedule surgical treatment aortic disease , post-operative patient patient surveillance know aortic root and/or aortic valve disease image . Only patient clinical indication MRI aorta/aortic valve include .</detailed_description>
