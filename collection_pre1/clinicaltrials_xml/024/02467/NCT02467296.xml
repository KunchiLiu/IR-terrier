	<brief_summary>Currently , recommendation sodium intake restriction patient heart failure mostly base expert consensus observational evidence , whereas small randomized study actually suggest strict dietary sodium reduction may harmful heart failure . In present clinical trial pilot study , investigator plan collect data enrollment rate , compliance , outcomes , safety 12-week dietary intervention heart failure patient , prepare food contain two different level sodium ( 1,500 mg 3,000 mg ) daily , follow 12-week surveillance safety effectiveness . The goal inform design fullscale clinical trial provide definitive evidence dietary sodium recommendation heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Sodium Intake Outcomes Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite intense research improve outcome heart failure , evidence remain scarce ( mostly observational ) dietary sodium restriction , arguably widely recommend self-care measure heart failure . In explicit acknowledgement evidence gap unclear benefit , recent European Society Cardiology guideline assign level evidence sodium intake recommendation American College Cardiology ( ACC ) American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline provide specific target level sodium intake patient HF . Although seem reasonable restrict sodium &lt; 3000 mg/d heart failure , currently unknown `` low '' appropriate patient . This study attempt provide basis evaluate guideline determine , consecutive HFrEF patient EF ≤40 % acute HF admission , proportion patient : ( 1 ) willing participate 12-week feeding trial ; ( 2 ) meet trial eligibility criterion ; ( C ) subsequently continue consume ≥3000 mg/d sodium 15-30 day post discharge despite discharge instruction . This allow investigator estimate enrollment rate full-scale trial . This study randomize 50 eligible patient prepared meal plan either 1500 mg/d vs. 3000 mg/d sodium 12 week . The hypothesis present study ( 1 ) ≥ 90 % patient retain study 12 week ( first outcome safety event ) ( 2 ) patient compliant provide food ≥ 90 % study day . Study Primary Endpoints : ( ) Overall on-study retention ( ii ) compliance prepare food , assess via daily food diary 24-h urine collection baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 week . Study Secondary Endpoints : Estimate trend ( 1 ) all-cause mortality , readmission , emergency room visit ; ( 2 ) NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level ; ( 3 ) diet palatability quality life , two arm . Safety endpoint : Safety intervention assess vital sign laboratory assessment . This pilot study expect yield critical information necessary sufficient design full-scale clinical trial provide evidence dietary sodium recommendation heart failure .</detailed_description>
