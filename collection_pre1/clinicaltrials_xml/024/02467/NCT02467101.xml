	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Intralesional Corticosteroid Treatment Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frontal fibrosing alopecia ( FFA ) primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia , first describe postmenopausal woman , Kossard 1994 . Since , FFA also report premenopausal woman rarely men . The exact cause FFA unknown . One possible reason disturb immune response component scalp hair follicle , however , whether hair loss cause hormonal fluctuation question . Some author , consider FFA variant liquen planopilaris ( LPP ) . Whether FFA truly LPP variant distinct entity share clinical feature remain determined . FFA also diagnose family member ( mother daughter ) suggest possible genetic contribution . Clinically , characterize progressive frontal temporoparietal recession hairline due inflammatory destruction hair follicle . Hair loss occur band-like distribution depth recession 0,5-8 cm . Often , small number isolate hair spar within band alopecia . Loss eyebrows ( partial complete ) find FFA case , precede hairline recession . The affected skin atrophic , shiny , often lighter chronically sun-exposed forehead skin . The diagnosis FFA usually make basis clinical finding , laboratory test rarely require . Dermoscopy , noninvasive tool help diagnosis FFA ; The dermoscopic feature FFA : Absence follicular opening , perifollicular scale , feeble perifollicular erythema . Perifollicular erythema recede hairline may sign active disease . Since first description FFA , many report publish , number new case FFA appear increase . Currently , evidence-based study guide treatment clearly define line treatment condition . Therefore treatment option vary among clinician . The aim study find intralesional triamcinolone acetonide ( compare area treat placebo ) may help halt slow progression disease . The patient divide two group ( A B ) : 1 . Group A : right half-head ( active border disease ) : treatment intralesional triamcinolone acetonide leave half-head ( active border disease ) : placebo ( saline solution ) 2 . Group B : right half-head ( active border disease ) : placebo ( saline solution ) leave half-head ( active border disease ) : intralesional triamcinolone acetonide The aim study find intralesional triamcinolone may help halt slow progres- sion disease . All patient provide write informed consent participate study , perform accord Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
