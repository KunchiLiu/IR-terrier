	<brief_summary>Diagnosis pneumonia elderly difficult poor sensitivity specificity clinical sign well image chest radiography ( RT ) . New diagnostic tool thoracic low-dose compute tomography ( CT ) , expose patient weak dose irradiation , could improve diagnosis . Moreover , low-dose CT could provide additional accuracy etiological clarification pneumonia elderly people . As first step , investigator aim perform 1 year ( 12 month inclusion + 3 month follow-up ) prospective study include Divisions Internal Medicine , Rehabilitation , Geriatrics Radiology University Hospitals Geneva . In study , patient &gt; 65 year old clinical suspicion low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) include . They prescribe antimicrobial therapy . Both chest radiography low-dose thoracic CT perform within first 72 hour admission , blood test nasopharyngeal swab . The clinician 's diagnosis , result CT , compare end study adjudication committee 's diagnostic opinion access available clinical , laboratory chest X-ray data consider gold standard . At end study , CT image blind-reviewed two expert radiology . The impact CT scan diagnosis pneumonia assess , sensitivity specificity population . During first 12 month study , patient undergo systematic nasopharyngeal swab admission discharge , eluates conserve . During next 12 month , virological bacteriological polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform , use new diagnostic tool , order determine etiological diagnosis population evaluate impact new tool management pneumonia population . Analysis data allow clinical , radiological microbiological correlation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project 's principal aim assess impact low-dose CT scan versus chest radiography diagnosis pneumonia elderly patient . One secondary objective estimate sensitivity specificity CT scan pneumonia diagnosis elderly ( gold standard : adjudication committee advice ) . This prospective study consider preliminary feasibility study preparation future randomize clinical trial compare patient management , antibiotic prescription clinical outcome one group patient LRTI randomize routine thoracic CT scan one group randomize usual care . The second phase study explore etiology pneumonia elderly use new diagnostic tool . This lead identify radiological pattern associate clinical presentation microbiological result . Primary objective : estimate impact CT scan diagnosis pneumonia elderly patient , monocentric study ( within two site , Service de Médecine Interne Générale Hôpital de Trois-Chêne ) . Secondary objective : estimate sensitivity specificity CT scan pneumonia diagnosis ( gold standard : adjudication committee advice ) , identify microbiological etiology pneumonia elderly . Study-design : prospective interventional study . Intervention : Patients manage accord HUG guideline . Frontal ( lateral possible ) chest radiography ( RT ) interpret physician ; assess level certainty diagnosis pneumonia Likert scale , well localization . Subsequently , thoracic CT scan perform within first 48-72 hour admission , conclusion radiologist ( Likert scale ) . After CT scan , physician get result assess new level certainty diagnosis ( Likert scale ) . If clinician change therapy , note case report form ( CRF ) . Patients undergo two nasopharyngeal swab ( admission discharge ) storage biobank , microbiological ( bacteriological viral ) PCR perform later date . Patients follow day 90 . Information concern rehospitalization death obtain review patient 's medical chart civil registry . At end study , chest radiograph ( RT ) CT blinded-analyzed two refer radiologist ( MS XM ) . An adjudication committee ( one internist , one infectiologist , one pneumologist ) review patient ' data order provide gold standard diagnosis make accord international guideline ( 8 , 9 ) : clinical symptom , recent new abnormality chest radiograph outcome antimicrobial therapy . After end clinical study , virology group analyze eluates nasopharyngeal swab use new PCR test . After complete routine PCR ( Adenovirus , Bocavirus , Coronavirus , Enterovirus , Influenza A B virus , Parainfluenza virus , Parechovirus , Picornavirus , Respiratory Syncytial Virus , Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , two different bacterial PCR kit use test eluate ( admission discharge ) : Fast Track Diagnostics ( FTD ) Bacterial pneumonia CAP ( Community Acquired Pneumonia ) kit ( Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , Staphylococcus aureus , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Legionella spp ) FTD Bacterial pneumonia HAP ( Hospital Acquired Pneumonia ) kit ( Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) . The expense additional examination charge patient health insurance company , pay HUG within framework fix price hospitalization . Evaluation criterion : - Assessments physician , CT scanning , compare : number upgrade downgraded diagnosis ; sensitivity specificity chest radiography RT CT ; correlation physician radiologist . - Descriptions etiology pneumonia , number viral bacterial pneumonia . - Clinical , radiological , microbiological correlation . - Outcome ( re-hospitalization , mortality ) 30 90 day . Statistical consideration : The investigator hypothesize chest CT upgrade certainty diagnosis 19 % case ( 14 ) . To significantly increase level diagnosis pneumonia , 46 patient suspicion pneumonia need ( α = 0.05 , β 0.1 ) . The investigator estimate rate pneumonia population 45 % ( 15 ) ; imply 100 participant enrol order significantly increase accuracy diagnosis . Inclusion study could begin June 2015 , 12 month , last follow-up last patient come total 15 month ( 12 month plus 90 day ) . Anticipated result : The investigator anticipate low-dose CT scan improve diagnosis pneumonia elderly . The study 's final objective prepare second randomize study measure impact chest CT scan management patient two cohort patient - one undergoes chest X-ray , one undergoes CT scan - assess diagnosis treatment .</detailed_description>
