	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see electrical stimulation leg muscle improve strength patient receive mechanical ventilation intensive care unit ( ICU ) . ICU care frequently result chronically critically ill ( CCI ) patient . Some CCI patient develop persistent inflammation/immunosuppression catabolism syndrome ( PICS ) , morbid long-term outcome . CCI patient PICS often develop severe limb muscle atrophy , weakness accelerate protein catabolism . Limb muscle dysfunction PICS due many factor include sepsis/inflammation , proteolysis , apoptosis , inactivity . Despite seriousness limb muscle weakness CCI patient receive mechanical ventilation , little known exercise strategy treat problem . There limited knowledge strength training impact inflammation catabolism CCI patient . In addition , assessment effect exercise marker inflammation protein catabolism muscle sample obtain biopsy technique venous blood sample perform . This project understand treat CCI-related muscle weakness strength training improve muscle function , also potentially blunt inflammation catabolism PICS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As participant study , follow take place : Assignment study group : random assignment do one two group list generate computer program , much like flip coin . One group subject assign effective muscle stimulation group second group assign group receive ineffective stimulation ( Control Sham ) . Muscle stimulation perform Niveus medical stimulator quadriceps muscle group 30 minute , five day per week . The stimulator individually adjust term intensity stimulation elicit visible palpable quadriceps muscle contraction . Four contraction per minute perform total approximately 120 contraction per 30 minute treatment . Isometric Muscle strength testing : All subject undergo isometric muscle strength test . Maximal isometric twitch strength measure placing subject ' dominant leg frame hold knee 60° . A cuff place around patient 's ankle connect electronic dynamometer cable . A magnetic nerve stimulator use body quadriceps muscle stimulate muscle .</detailed_description>

Inability walk without assistance prior ICU admission ( exclude use cane walker ) 9. lowerextremity amputation , rheumatic severe osteoarthritis joint low extremity , 10 . Unrepaired hip fracture , unstable cervical spine bone diseases 11. arterial venous insufficiency lower extremity , 12. prior arrangement transfer facility 28 day treatment , 13. unstable `` difficult airway '' 14 day ICU care , predict last 72 hour , 14. vasopressor vasodilatory agent continuous infusion `` renal dose , '' 15. severe cardiac dysrhythmias , 16. acute coronary syndrome , 17. pulmonary contraindication ( pneumo/hemothorax , flail chest ) , 18. persistent surgical problem postoperative period ( serious postoperative bleeding , wound dehiscence , etc . ) —when problem resolve patient meet entry criterion , eligible recruit participation , 19. active neuromuscular disease would prevent interfere respond strength training ( e.g. , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis , myasthenia gravis , polymyositis , muscular dystrophy dystrophy myopathy ) , 20 . Allergic lidocaine 21 . High risk bleed secondary organic condition medication 22 . Any anatomical difficulty obtain biopsy ( overweight ) 23 . CPR admission 24 . Full dose anticoagulation therapy ( ex . Heparin infusion , full anticoagulation dose enoxaparin , Coumadin/Warfarin/Jantoven/Marevan/Waran , Argatroban ) . 25 . Patient antiplatelet therapy medicine Plavix ( also know Clopidogrel , Clopilet , Ceruvin ) , Aggrenox ( also know aspirin Dipyridamol ) , Ticlid ( also know ticlopidine ) , Agrylin Xagrid ( also know Anagrelide ) . Of note , aspirin exclusion criterion , long antiplatelet medication patient receive . In addition , non steroidal antiinflammatory agentsNSAIDS ( Ibuprofen , Naproxen , Indomethicin antiinflammatories ) contraindication muscle biopsy procedure 26. factor investigator ' judgment would unnecessarily increase risk patient .</criteria>
