	<brief_summary>Diabetes Prevention Program translational effort , Group Lifestyle Balance Program ( GLB ) , show effective reduce weight modify diabetes CVD risk factor variety diverse community setting . Although one two primary goal DPP translation program focus increase physical activity level , publish DPP translation study report result change physical activity one study reporting activity level objective measurement instrument . In order completely understand role physical activity play make healthy lifestyle change , critical validate impact activity use valid reliable objective measure . In addition , current study suggest decrease time spend sit may positive health impact separate effect participate plan bout moderate intensity activity . Therefore , propose examine impact modify version GLB program , focus decrease sedentary/sitting behavior . The result project provide information regard best option physical activity within lifestyle intervention program , focus verify current role physical activity lifestyle intervention use objective measure examine alternative intervention option translation effort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Translation effort base upon successful Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) show behavioral lifestyle intervention model effective variety diverse community setting . Despite fact physical activity key part DPP lifestyle intervention one two intervention goal , activity change DPP , and/or result translation study model , adequately verified accurate objective measure . In addition , previous research show , many subgroup general population , moderate vigorous physical activity non-existent . Individuals activity low end intensity spectrum may difficult time increase level moderate+ intensity physical activity various reason limit function lack motivation . For individual , intervention movement goal increase plan bout moderate intensity activity may effective therefore beneficial intervention movement goal decrease time spend sit . The purpose proposal understand impact movement , specifically physical activity sit time , DPP-adapted community lifestyle intervention , Group Lifestyle Balance ( GLB ) . Aim 1 : To determine GLB lifestyle intervention , show effective translation effort decrease weight increase self-reported activity , significant change physical activity level determine validate objective measure , accelerometer . It hypothesize participant randomized conventional lifestyle intervention arm ( GLB-MOD ) significant improvement primary endpoint weight physical activity ( measure objectively ) compare delayed-intervention control 6 month reduction several secondary outcome measure ( fast glucose , insulin , blood pressure , waist , lipid , physical function , quality life ) . Aim 2 : To determine lifestyle intervention program similar one described , change activity focus replace inactivity focus ( GLB-SED ) , also effective . It hypothesize participant randomize GLB-SED significant improvement primary endpoint weight decrease inactivity ( measure objectively ) compare delayed-intervention control 6 month significant reduction several secondary endpoint ( fast glucose , insulin , blood pressure , waist circumference , lipid , physical function , quality life ) . Secondary Aims : To examine pre-post change participant weight , physical activity ( objective subjective ) , sedentary time baseline 6 12 month intervention randomize arm understand inter-relationships behavioral factor time . It hypothesize GLB-MOD participant achieve significant weight loss also significant increase moderate+ intensity activity level . Similarly , hypothesize GLB-SED participant achieve significant weight loss also significant decrease amount time spend sedentary/sitting . An estimate difference participant cost two version lifestyle intervention program also determine . Aim # 1 address important remain gap prevention literature ; objectively measure activity improve result exist intervention use DPP-based translation effort change activity impact weight change ? Aim # 2 examines impact replace conventional physical activity goal increase plan relatively brief bout moderate physical activity one focusing decrease sedentary time within framework successful translation lifestyle intervention adapt DPP , Group Lifestyle Balance ( GLB ) program . The study design prospective , six month delayed-control intervention 321 subject ( age 50 old BMI â‰¥24 kg/m2 prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome ) recruit community center randomly assign one three group : standard GLB program include conventional moderate activity goal ( GLB-MOD ) , GLB program focus decrease sedentary behavior ( GLB-SED ) , delay intervention . Subjects assign GLB-MOD GLB-SED , separately compare 6 month delayed-control group time , delay group randomly assign either GLB-MOD GLB-SED . Participants complete baseline , 6 , 12 month assessment visit . Change weight , objectively measure activity , time spend sedentary primary outcome secondary outcome include change self-reported physical activity , HbA1c , fast glucose , lipid , blood pressure , waist circumference , quality life physical function . It hypothesize physical activity assess accelerometry GLB-MOD significantly increase ( mostly moderate intense activity ) significant decrease weight , partly related change activity level . The 2nd hypothesis GLB-SED intervention significantly decrease time spend sit measured accelerometry change also related significant decrease weight . The information gain entire effort important , innovative , allow u obtain complete accurate understanding end physical activity/inactivity spectrum impact community prevention intervention program . If show effective , innovative , modify sedentary-focused translation intervention program would provide valuable future translation option .</detailed_description>
