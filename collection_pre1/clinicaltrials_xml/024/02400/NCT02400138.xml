	<brief_title>Home-based Respiratory Training After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Weakness respiratory muscle demonstrate individual stroke , may generate important symptom , fatigue dyspnea . Since adequate strength inspiratory expiratory muscle require , mainly perform physical activity , rehabilitation intervention stroke subject include respiratory training . Aim : This study test hypothesis home-based combined inspiratory muscular training ( IMT ) plus expiratory muscular training ( EMT ) program effective improve strength endurance inspiratory expiratory muscle , fatigue , exercise capacity , quality life ( QoL ) stroke subject . Design : For prospective , double-blinded , randomized clinical trial , people stroke randomly allocate either experimental control/sham group . The experimental group undertake training inspiratory plus expiratory muscle Threshold® IMT Threshold™ PEP regulate 40 % subject ' maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) value , five times/week eight week 30 minutes/day . The control group undertake protocol , participant receive threshold device without resistance valve . At baseline , post intervention , four 12 week cessation ( two follow-up ) intervention , researcher blind group allocation collect outcome measure . Study outcomes : Primary outcome MIP MEP . Secondary outcome include inspiratory expiratory endurance , fatigue , dyspnea sensation , exercise capacity , QoL .</detailed_description>
