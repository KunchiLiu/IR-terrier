	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis computertomography ( CT ) superior invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) concern primary endpoint MACE ( MACE = major adverse cardiovascular event ; define least one following : cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke ) maximum follow-up 4 year , word , CT result significantly low rate MACE . Secondary outcome include MICE ( MICE = minor cardiovascular event ) , procedural complication , cost-effectiveness , radiation exposure , cross-over CT ICA , gender difference , health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Imaging Strategies Patients With Stable Chest Pain Intermediate Risk Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective prospective pragmatic randomise control trial ( PRCT ) 3546 patient evaluate possible superiority CT-based patient management ICA-based management strategy stable chest pain patient intermediate pretest probability ( 10-60 % ) coronary artery disease . The primary outcome measure occurrence MACE ( MACE = major adverse cardiovascular event ; define least one following : cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke ) maximum follow-up 4 year CT ICA . Secondary outcome include health relate quality life , cost-effectiveness , cross-over ICA/CT . Procedural complication classify major minor . Major procedural complication composite end-point include death , nonfatal stroke , nonfatal myocardial infarction complication prolong hospitalization least 24 hr . Possible procedural complication : Hematoma puncture site , secondary bleeding puncture site , bradycardia , angina without infarction , allergoid contrast agent reaction , stent migration , hypotension require treatment , headache , hyperthyreodism , skin tissue nerve injury , extravasate , cardiac arrhythmia , contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) , infection , femoral arterial occlusion ( arterial access vessel ) dissection , new requirement dialysis , DVT/pulmonary embolism , closure injury vessel , injury heart ( e.g . valve myocardium ) , cardiac tamponade , perforation , retroperitoneal bleeding , gastrointestinal bleeding , genital-urinary bleeding , major bleeding , red blood cell ( RBC ) /whole blood transfusion , twist rupture catheter part , equipment mishap ( e.g . retain foreign body guidewire fracture ) , development arterio-venous fistula ( ) , development pseudo aneurysm puncture site , dissection , permanent edema ( e.g . due lymphatic congestion puncture site ) , embolisation central peripheral vessel due thromboembolis , acute closure coronary vessel , stent infection , heart failure , cardiogenic shock , wrong patient wrong procedure . This study European multicentre study conduct 20 clinical centre 15 European country methodologically base single-centre CAD-Man trial conduct Charit√© ( NCT00844220 ) . The pragmatic approach study ensure generate practical usable outcome clinical decision-making accord comparative effectiveness research methodology . In precede pilot study , data cost-effectiveness analysis image-quality analysis collect method define implementation main PRCT . Also appropriate instrument health relate quality life choose . DISCHARGE receive fund 7th Framework Programme European Commission ( EC-GA 603266 ) .</detailed_description>
