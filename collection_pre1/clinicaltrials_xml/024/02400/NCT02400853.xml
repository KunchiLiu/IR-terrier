	<brief_summary>The frequent complication premature infant neurological complication : intracranial hemorrhage white matter lesion . In Epipage 2 study incidence severe intraventricular hemorrhage remain stable . Severe hemorrhage associate neurological sequela . A recent study human animal show role complex form plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) inhibitor ( PAI-1 ) induction vascular fragility via stromelysin ( MMP-3 ) . FIBRINAT study Rouen University Hospital show rate complex t-PA-PAI1 probably high preterm infant . An factor maturation PDGF-C induce t-PA associate vascular embrittlement . Among genetic factor associate cerebral palsy include 2 SNP PAI-1 gene one SNP gene endothelial NO synthase . The hypothesis high rate complex t-PA-PAI-1 cord blood could high risk intracranial hemorrhage preterm infant provide predictive occurrence . The rate MMP-3 , PDGF-C PAI-1 free cord blood , polymorphism PAI-1 gene eNOS could separately associate main criterion identify predictive hemorrhage . The main objective search rate difference complex t-PA-PAI-1 cord blood preterm infant ( 30 week gestation ) would predict intracranial hemorrhage come first day life . The secondary objective - Evaluate potential marker risk high level MMP-3 , PAI-1 free , PDGF-CC - Search group presence allele -675G4 / G5 11053 ( G / T ) PAI-1 gene -922 ( A / G ) eNOS gene . 120 preterm infant include 30 week gestation precise inclusion exclusion criterion period 3 year . Patients divide two group accord whether show intracranial hemorrhage ( detect ultrasound J5-J7 ) . The complex rate tPA-PAI-1 , PAI-1 free , MMP-3 PDGF-C measured . The comparison two group carry use statistical test . Comparison presence allele -675 4G 11053T PAI-1 gene -922G eNOS gene two group perform . The demonstration hypothesis would permit identify child birth immediate implementation preventive treatment bleed desirable .</brief_summary>
