	<brief_summary>In pregnancy , cART consider optimal maternal health prevent emergence resistance could compromise care . In Canada , majority HIV-positive pregnant woman receive PI-based cART regimen . In past , therapy generally defer first trimester ( require maternal health ) minimize unknown risk teratogenicity . However , treatment start earlier HIV infection perinatal transmission rate lowest prolonged suppression viral load pregnancy , woman increasingly commence cART either conception earlier pregnancy . Multiple report cohort study provide data suggest association PI-based cART use preterm birth , low birth weight , small gestational age ( SGA ) baby , although conflict data exist . In general population progesterone supplementation widely use , well tolerate , consider safe , beneficial prevent recurrent pre-term birth increase birth weight . The investigator experimental finding suggest PI use pregnancy associate decline progesterone level correlate fetal growth , progesterone supplementation improve PI-induced fetal growth restriction . The investigator preliminary finding HIV+ pregnant woman suggest PI-use associated decline progesterone level , correlate birth weight percentile . Since HIV-positive woman higher rate pre-term delivery low birth weight may magnify use PIs , progesterone supplementation could benefit neonatal health context HIV-positive pregnancy .</brief_summary>
