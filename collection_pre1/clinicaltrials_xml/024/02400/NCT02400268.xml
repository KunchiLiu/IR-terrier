	<brief_summary>The antimicrobial crisis real problem . Infections produce multiresistant bacteria become frequent , available antimicrobial agent usually scarce . Reducing duration antimicrobial treatment one efficient measure control antibiotic pressure optimise use agent . Bloodstream infection produce Enterobacteria ( EB ) frequent , optimal duration antibiotic treat unknown , long clinical trial specifically develop answer question . Basing expert opinion , Infectious Diseases Society pf America ( IDSA ) recommend bacteremia EB secondary vascular catheter infection treat 7 14 day . This represent variability 100 % . No recommendation publish regard duration treatment bacteremia source . The objective project prove 7-day course treatment EB bacteremia efficient equally safe 14-day scheme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To achieve thesis objective , propose randomize , multicentric clinical trial superiority design duration antimicrobial treatment EB bacteremia adult patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Adults patient ( equal 18 year old ) Primary secondary bloodstream infection produce enterobacteriaceae Source bacteremia properly control expect properly control next 24 hour ( i.e . bacteremia produce infected vascular catheter , abscess , obstruction biliary urinary tract ) . Patients able understand objective clinical trial inform consent sign . Pregnancy Postchemotherapy neutropenia expect persist 7 day . Source bacteremia uncontrolled inclusion period follow 24 hour . The source consider uncontrolled bacteremia secondary suppurative infection potentially removable , action take eradicate , include : bacteremia vascular remove catheter , cholangitis secondary derive obstruction biliary tract , deep abscess drain , pyohydronephrosis without derivation urinary tract . Bacteremia secondary infective endocarditis , bone joint infection , neurosurgical infection , may require prolonged antimicrobial therapy Bacteremia due enterobacteriaceae resistant carbapenemics . Polymicrobial bacteremia include microorganisms different enterobacteriaceae . Patients expectation survival next 48 hour inclusion .</criteria>
