	<brief_title>The Effect Constructing Virtual Patient Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solving VP case associate large improvement learn effectiveness dependent active student involvement . Constructing VP case rather solve may engage student actively encode new information integrate previous knowledge . Fourth-year medical student include randomized constructing ( intervention ) solve ( control ) four cardiopulmonary VP case . The participant present short case overview . The control group solve case , whereas intervention group also receive final diagnosis complete history , physical finding , lab result . After week , participant complete transfer test involve two standardized patient present respiratory case cardiology case , respectively . Performances video-recorded subsequently assess two blind raters use Reporter-Interpreter- Manager-Educator ( RIME ) framework . Knowledge gain assess use pre- post-test 95-item Multiple-Response-Questionnaire ( MRQ ) .</detailed_description>
