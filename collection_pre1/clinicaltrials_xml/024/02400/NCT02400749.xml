To eligible , subject must moderate severe plaque psoriasis involve palm sol , lesion cover least 10 % surface palm sol baseline visit . Study treatment assign randomly ( like flip coin ) 1:1 ratio , mean 1 2 chance either receive Apremilast placebo first 16 week . Subjects know two treatment receive . The study doctor , study staff know treatment receive either . All subject receive Apremilast Week 16 Week 32 . Subjects ask complete questionnaire hand foot pain , quality life , general health impact psoriasis work . Medical photograph palm sole take subject select study site . At Baseline Week 16 visit , willing subject certain study site , skin biopsy take . The biopsy analyze presence antibody , antigens certain cellular messenger quantify . It also possible study skin cellular structure organization . A total 3 biopsy take : At Baseline visit , one biopsy psoriasis palm sole one biopsy normal skin palm sol collect .
