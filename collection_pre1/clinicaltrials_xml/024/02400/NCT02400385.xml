	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Sunitinib Nivolumab KIT-mutated Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curtin Bastian 2006 first describe KIT mutation melanoma . Although uncommon non-acral cutaneous melanoma , mutation frequent mucosal acral melanoma . The KIT mutation melanoma similar KIT mutation gastrointestinal intestinal stromal sarcoma ( GIST ) believe driver mutation . In melanomas mutation occur exclusive pattern tumor without NRAS , BRAF , GNAQ mutation . There evidence stage four melanoma patient KIT mutation bad prognosis patient similar stage primary site . Both imatinib sunitinib FDA approve treatment patient GIST ; oral tyrosine kinase KIT inhibitor study melanoma patient KIT mutation . Imatinib best study objective response 20 % patient multicenter trial , considerably low efficacy see GIST . Sunitinib theoretical advantage anti-angiogenic activity well anti -KIT activity demonstrate objective response three four patient small trial sponsor Pfizer . ( see citation ) . Immunotherapy major role treatment metastatic melanoma , approval use Interleukin-2 ipilimumab ability immunotherapy produce durable response prolong survival minority , significant number , patient . Both sunitinib ipilimumab intestinal perforation unusual significant toxicity , argue use two agent combination . The anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab , however , immunologic agent yield rapid durable response melanoma less colitis less risk intestinal perforation ipilimumab . Nivolumab FDA approve December 2014 NCCN guideline include first-line option . Combining KIT receptor inhibition sunitinib immunotherapy Nivolumab attractive investigational approach combination produce complementary perhaps synergistic efficacy . Asim et al report ASCO June 2014 phase one study sunitinib nivolumab treatment metastatic renal cell cancer . Sunitinib ( 50 mg/day x 4 week , 2 week nivolumab 2mg/kg 5mg/kg q 3 week administer 33 patient . No dose-limiting toxicity see grade 3-4 AEs see 24 33 patient . The common AEs elevate ALT ( 18 % ) , hypertension ( 15 % ) hyponatremia ( 15 % ) . Objective response sere see 52 % ( 17/33 ) indicate `` encouraging activity manageable safety profile '' patient renal cell cancer . The Nivolumab dose 5mg/kg Q 3 week ( 1.67mg/kg/week ) study slightly usual dose 3mg/kg Q 2 week ( 1.5mg/kg/week ) . Study Design : This open-label multi-center phase 2 study sunitinib Nivolumab combination patient KIT mutate metastatic melanoma . Study begin FDA approval nivolumab Total number study subject approximately 12-18 patient . Objectives Primary objective : 1 . To describe preliminary clinical efficacy sunitinib give combination nivolumab patient KIT-mutated melanoma 2 . To describe immunologic effect sunitinib administer combination Nivolumab Co-primary endpoint : 1 . Objective response use RECIST 1.1 immune modify response criterion 2 . Progression-free survival use immune-modified response criterion Secondary endpoint : 1 . Toxicities use CTAE criterion 2 . Changes peripheral blood total lymphocyte count T B cell count 3 . Overall survival The trial sponsor California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute sunitinib provide Pfizer . Commercial source use nivolumab , whose use accord NCCN guideline .</detailed_description>
