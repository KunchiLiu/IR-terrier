	<brief_summary>For prepubertal patient , cryopreservation testicular tissue option available preserve fertility cancer treatment . But testicular autograft raise issue risk reintroduction potentially malignant cell . The aim study develop specific sensitive method residual disease detection testicular tissue patient treat solid tumor infancy , whose fertility may compromise treatment benefit testicular tissue cryopreservation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contamination Testicle Tissue RT-PCR Participants With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some solid tumor high risk metastatic localization include testis . There concern possible presence malignant cell testicular tissue could cause recurrence primary disease reimplantation . Thus , possibility testicular tissue involvement need evaluate sensitive molecular method . Based experience detection RT-PCR minimal residual disease ( MRD ) neuroblastoma since 1994 [ Tchirkov et al . 2003 ] testicular tissue cryopreservation since 2012 , want develop specific sensitive method residual disease detection RT-PCR order evaluate tumor contamination testicular harvest tissue . Study population : We choose 3 model pediatric solid tumor high risk metastasis often require sterilize treatment ( chemo and/or radiotherapy ) : neuroblastoma , Ewing tumor alveolar rhabdosarcoma . We use four tumor cell line : IMR32 SK-NSH neuroblastoma ; RD-ES Ewing tumor ; RH-30 rhabdosarcoma . We plan use 20 fragment per line . Study duration : 12 month Study design : Testicular tissue without know malignancy condition warrant biopsy ( fertility assessment ) harvest . The harvested testicular cortex treat recover viable sperm , use remain tissue contaminate tumor cell line . Then , detection specific transcript do RT-PCR fresh tissue freeze/thaw . Total RNA extract TRI-reagent qRT-PCR perform use `` TaqMan '' technology . Primary endpoint : reach sensitivity 1/106 cell .</detailed_description>
