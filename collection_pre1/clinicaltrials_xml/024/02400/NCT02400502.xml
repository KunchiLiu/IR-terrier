The long-term goal test intervention aim improve stress reactivity . The objective application develop test feasibility novel therapeutic intervention combine strategy improve stress reactivity increase meaningful cop . The central hypothesis intervention improve stress reactivity measure proximally endocrine , immune , autonomic index result improve adaptive capacity , good role functioning , reduce risk relapse , decrease likelihood disability people early stage schizophrenia . The rationale propose research stress reactivity may modifiable risk factor underlie functional deficit schizophrenia . The intervention integrate two treatment approach . The first base research show mindfulness meditation practice associate alteration neural process stressful event target adaptive response stress . The second focus provide buffer stress use self-generation adaptive emotion positive psychology intervention , potentially associate building protective social resource .
