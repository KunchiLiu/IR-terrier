	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Ruxolitinib Secondary Hemophagocytic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophagocytic Syndrome ( HPS ) disorder characterize pathological activation immune system result systemic disorder characterize excessive cytokine production macrophage activation , culminate cytopenias evidence hemophagocytosis tissue specimen . The disorder sporadic familial due one several mutation primarily see pediatric population , report incidence 1 case per 3000 admissions1 . The actual incidence adult unknown rarely sporadic , secondary viral infection , malignancy , autoimmune disease . HPS universally fatal disease untreated . In adult , median survival report less 2 month diagnosis treatment delayed2 . Adult patient treat pediatric protocol early institution etoposide steroid consolidation allogeneic stem cell transplant appropriately select patient familial form identify 3 . Other treatment strategy attempt , include rituximab4 , infliximab5 , entaracept6 , tocilizumab7 , alemtuzumab8 . These anecdotal report highlight therapeutic potential cytokine-targeted therapy disorder . This pilot study determine efficacy Ruxolitinib secondary hemophagocytic syndrome . The primary objective ass efficacy ruxolitinib 15 mg PO twice daily patient HPS . The primary endpoint overall survival two month . Patients receive Ruxolitinib 15 mg twice daily orally either empty stomach food 3 week ( 21 day ) 3 week ( 21 day ) cycle . Ruxolitinib administer continuous 21-day cycle . In absence treatment delay cessation due adverse event , treatment may continue indefinitely one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression . - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment . - The investigator considers , safety reason , best interest patient . - Unacceptable adverse event toxicity issue cause delay study drug administration 4 week . - General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . - Patient decision withdraw treatment ( partial consent ) study ( full consent . - Death . Patients follow toxicity 30 day treatment discontinue death , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
