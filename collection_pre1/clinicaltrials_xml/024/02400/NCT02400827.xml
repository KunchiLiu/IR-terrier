	<brief_summary>For prepubertal patient , cryopreservation ovarian tissue option available preserve fertility cancer treatment . But ovarian autograft raise issue risk reintroduction potentially malignant cell . The aim study develop specific sensitive method residual disease detection ovarian tissue patient treat solid tumor infancy , whose fertility may compromise treatment benefit ovarian tissue cryopreservation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contamination Ovarian Tissue RT-PCR Participants With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some solid tumor high risk metastatic localization include ovary . There concern possible presence malignant cell ovarian tissue could cause recurrence primary disease reimplantation . Thus , possibility ovarian tissue involvement need evaluate sensitive molecular method . Those technique available leukaemia histology still way solid tumor . Based experience detection RT-PCR minimal residual disease ( MRD ) neuroblastoma since 1994 [ Tchirkov et al . 2003 ] ovarian tissue cryopreservation since 1995 [ Schubert et al . 2005 , Chambon press ] , want develop specific sensitive method residual disease detection RT-PCR order evaluate tumor contamination ovarian harvest tissue . Study population : We choose 3 model pediatric solid tumor high risk metastasis often require sterilize treatment ( chemo and/or radiotherapy ) : neuroblastoma , Ewing tumor alveolar rhabdosarcoma . We use four tumor cell line : IMR32 SK-NSH neuroblastoma ; RD-ES Ewing tumor ; RH-30 rhabdosarcoma . We plan use 20 fragment per line . Study duration : 12 month Study design : Ovarian tissue without know malignancy condition warrant laparoscopy ( benign cyst ) harvest kystectomy ( perikystic tissue ) . The harvested ovarian cortex cut : one half frozen accord routine protocol [ Schubert et al . 2005 ] half contaminate tumor cell line . Then , detection specific transcript do RT-PCR fresh tissue freeze/thaw . Total RNA extract TRI-reagent qRT-PCR perform use `` TaqMan '' technology . Primary endpoint : reach sensitivity 1/106 cell .</detailed_description>
