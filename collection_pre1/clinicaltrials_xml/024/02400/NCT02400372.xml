	<detailed_description>Study protocol The aim study evaluate `` The effect anti-bacterial honey dress heal split thickness skin graft donor site '' . Protocol Abstract . The use skin graft wound closure consider one common method field plastic surgery . Healing donor area secondary , gradual serious problem , Associated high percentage wound infection , Delay healing , Scars , Pain unpleasant odor problem . As today , ideal treatment cure donor area implant , due lack high-quality comparative study . The use honey treat wound know century different culture . Honey anti-inflammatory anti-bacterial effect , Debridement ability , Pain relief . Honey almost side effect . Effectiveness honey wound heal test many clinical trial , methodological problem low quality . Therefore , difficult conclude exist information handle guideline recommend clinical research .
