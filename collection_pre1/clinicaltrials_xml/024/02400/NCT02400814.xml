	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial compare administration schedule anti-programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A stereotactic ablative radiotherapy treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Monoclonal antibody , anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy , also know stereotactic body radiation therapy , specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may better treatment non-small cell lung cancer . However , yet know best administration schedule treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine administration schedule MPDL3280A ( anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A ) stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SAR ) promise move forward phase II trial base safety objective response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define safety toxicity profile MPDL3280A plus SAR use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4 ( v4 ) . II . Radiographic response rate immure-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) . III . Progression free survival use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 irRECIST . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Conduct correlative immunologic endpoint . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 arm . ARM I ( CONCURRENT COHORT ) : Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 1 course 1 , patient also undergo SAR 2-3 time per week ( minimum 40 hour maximum 96 hour fraction ) 1.5-2 week total 5 fraction . ARM II ( INDUCTION COHORT ) : Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 1 course 3 , patient also undergo SAR 2-3 time per week ( minimum 40 hour maximum 96 hour fraction ) 1.5-2 week total 5 fraction . ARM III ( SEQUENTIAL COHORT ) : Patients undergo SAR 2-3 time per week ( minimum 40 hour maximum 96 hour fraction ) 1.5-2 week total 5 fraction begin day 1 course 1 . After completion SAR ( begin day 1 course 2 ) , patient receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
