	<brief_title>Local Application Vancomycin Powder Grade I-IIIA Open Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Local administration 1 gram vancomycin powder site primarily closeable Gustilo-Anderson Grade I-IIIA open fracture time surgery , addition clinically accept open fracture management ( intravenous antibiotic , surgical irrigation debridement stabilization ) , significantly decrease postoperative infection rate comparison current treatment algorithm . Methods : Study subject randomize one two group prior surgery ( parallel group design ) : standard treatment ( control group ) versus vancomycin powder treatment ( experimental group ) . Each group equal number subject . Once randomize , intervention un-blinded facilitate treatment . Post-operatively , patient receive intravenous antibiotic , patient receive total 24 hour intravenous antibiotic . The surgical drain remove patient 's bedside approximately 24 hour surgical procedure . Patients follow surgeon routine schedule visit approximately 2 week , 6 week , 12 week , aseptic union resolution infection . There additional appointment solely purpose research follow-up .</detailed_description>
