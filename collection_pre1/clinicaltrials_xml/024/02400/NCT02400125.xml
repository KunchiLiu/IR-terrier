	<detailed_description>The volume cardiac surgery China increase rapidly rate approximately 10 % annually , approach 207,881 year 2013 . Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) valve procedure account 41 % . With age population , rise prevalence cardiovascular disease , rapid economic development China , volume cardiac procedure continuously rise year . In light burgeon volume cardiac procedure , consider imbalance economic development among region , lack standardized surgeon training system , critical concern regard quality cardiac surgery raise . Under circumstance , national registry continuously collect patient-by-patient data cardiovascular surgery critically important ( ) report characteristic patient , quality evolvement procedure , ( ii ) build valid surgical risk assessment tool , ( iii ) provide databases clinical study , quality improvement initiative , ( iv ) promote international exchange cooperation . Following example national cardiac procedure database , The Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) National Database The European Association Cardio-Thoracic Surgery ( EACTS ) Database , Fuwai Hospital , one large cardiac surgical care research center China , leverage initiative start first multicenter cardiac surgery registry Chinese mainland 2004 . The investigator start 32 participate site register CABG surgery first 2 year . From 2007 , investigator include valve surgery well . By end 2012 , 66 coordinate site participate voluntary database continuously intermittently , enrol 61,558 surgery data . This database become representative data source adult cardiac surgery China . This registry ( ) report performance quality adult cardiac surgery China , show observed risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rate isolate CABG China 2.2 % 1.9 % respectively , identify certain variation among region site , ( ii ) release in-hospital mortality risk prediction system CABG name SinoSCORE , suit Chinese population well , ( iii ) work EACTS merge databases together 4th Adult Cardiac Surgical Database Report , ( iv ) act one platform data source clinical study , publish 14 paper international indexed journal . In order extend volume participate site , build representative database performance , in-hospital well 1-year outcome CABG and/or valve surgery large cardiac surgery center China , year 2013 , China National Center Cardiovascular Diseases ( NCCD ) Fuwai Hospital leverage The China Cardiovascular Surgery Registry ( CCSR ) network push CCSR Study forward . The CCSR Study establish network 90 participate site cardiovascular surgery volume &gt; 100 per year , capability perform CABG and/or valve surgery . The participate site require consecutively routinely submit CABG valve surgery data regard patient ' personal information , risk factor , surgery performance , in-hospital outcome prescription drug , web-based paperless data collection system . The investigator also encourage site interview patient 1-month 1-year index procedure mid-term outcome medication discharge . The investigator conduct routine remote on-site monitoring audit ensure integrity accuracy data . Ethics Committee Fuwai Hospital approve study design audit conduct yearly . For in-hospital data collection , CCSR establish 11 module ( patient basic information , preoperative risk , cardiovascular presentation , cardiac examination , general information operation , CABG , valve surgery , surgery , post-operative complication , pre-operative medication medical order discharge ) , 416 item , among 157 item core dataset , 259 extend dataset . The core dataset mandatory set variable believe necessary accurate representation clinical practice , risk model development , analysis . The extended dataset include less critical still important field strongly encourage collected mandatory submitting . The creation custom field permissible site collect specific information desire . The investigator adapt Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium ( CDISC ) Standard data collection merging among international database . The investigator establish input item comparable STS National Database , common terminology definition STS National Database adopt well . Coordinators request consecutively register 5 variable regard basic information patient undergo isolated combine CABG and/or valve surgery hospital 3 day surgery . The basic information include name , sex , date birth , type surgery ID number . The investigator request coordinator submit complete in-hospital data within 28 day surgery . The investigator also develop standard data interface in-hospital data element . If quality participate site ' export data Hospital Information System meet safety quality criterion , also acceptable site export import in-hospital data automatically instead manual submitting . The investigator encourage participate site invite patient join prospective follow-up cohort interview patient discharge , follow-up interview optional . Coordinators participate site interview patient sign informed consent index hospitalization 1-month , 1-year index cardiac surgery face face telephone . The data include major cardiovascular cerebral outcome , readmission , self-administration . In order ensure follow-up data authenticity , permission patient participate site , NCC interview patient 3-month cardiac surgery use questionnaire . Data variable add internal quality integrity check . If component require mandatory data element miss , validation role logic n't meet , data automatically reject . In order audit accuracy in-hospital data , investigator randomly select 10-20 % participate site ' in-hospital data , require coordinator scan coordinate medical record , transfer NCC use encryption flash drive . 2 physician NCC abstract medical record data independently , compare data NCC data abstraction coordinator ' database . The accuracy report sit feed back participate site yearly . The on-site auditing conduct year site . The main aim on-site auditing ensure consecutiveness data registry . The investigator randomly select period time check original record surgery , abstract data regard patient ID in-hospital outcome . Any mismatch audit data submit data report NCC participate site .</detailed_description>
