	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call ixazomib ( also know MLN9708 ) combination dexamethasone rituximab ( regimen call IDR ) possible treatment Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Ixazomib , Dexamethasone Rituximab Patients With Untreated Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational regimen , IDR , learn whether IDR work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean IDR still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , IDR effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve IDR use participant type cancer . Ixazomib drug may kill stop cancer cell grow block proteasome within cell , responsible degrade break variety protein . This type drug call proteasome inhibitor . Rituximab type protein call antibody attack cluster differentiation 20 ( CD20 ) , protein find B-cells like WM . Rituximab approve FDA treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Dexamethasone steroid similar hormone naturally produce adrenal gland ; prevents release substance cause inflammation . Rituximab dexamethasone often use treat WM , alone combination drug . Combinations rituximab , dexamethasone proteasome inhibitor show good response rate WM participant . Ixazomib proteasome inhibitor ; thus investigator swill investigate combination Ixazomib , Rituximab , Dexamethasone also active WM . In research study , investigator combine new treatment ixazomib standard regimen , rituximab dexamethasone , determine whether combination ( IDR ) effective safe participant previously untreated WM .</detailed_description>
