	<brief_title>The Incidence Adjacent Synchronous Ipsilateral Infiltrating Carcinoma and/or DCIS Patients Diagnosed With Intraductal Papilloma Without Atypia Flat Epithelial Atypia Core Needle Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast milk make lobule carry duct toward nipple . Normal duct line one layer cell similar appearance . Flat epithelium atypia ( FEA ) intraductal papilloma without atypia ( IPWA ) change see within milk duct . In recent year lesion see often , seemingly core needle biopsy do help mammogram , ultrasound breast MRI . The reason new technology available able biopsy . A core needle biopsy use hollow needle remove sample tissue breast . This accurate method involve surgery . FEA IPWA common research study address . Women find FEA IPWA core biopsy result may receive conflict recommendation precede next . It unclear tissue remove biopsy site ensure cancer nearby . The purpose study find often cancer identify excisional biopsy near initial core biopsy FEA IPWA previously see . Depending finding doctor well able advise patient whether need surgical biopsy , FEA IPWA see needle biopsy , rule presence breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women race ethnic group eligible trial . This trial open accrual woman . Patients must woman Patients must least 18 year age Patients must image abnormality necessitate core needle biopsy The imaging abnormality must categorize Breast ImagingReporting Data System ( BIRADS ) level 14 lesion There document concordance* initial breast image find core biopsy pathology report . The core needle biopsy must contain FEA IPWA , accord local pathologist . ( It possible central pathology review do patient register protocol diagnosis discrepant make original institution 's pathologist . In case , study team communicate original institution 's site investigator within one week date central pathology review finalize ) . Patients may personal history prior concurrent fibroadenoma prior history proliferative breast lesion without atypia . Patients must register study within 60 day core needle biopsy . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . The patient still eligible study even decline consent tissue use ( ) correlative study describe document and/or decline consent tissue go tissue bank future unspecified research . Concordance determination radiologist ( cover provider ) performing imageguided core needle biopsy pathology report procedure correspond image appearance give lesion say lesion 's representative portion sample . Personal history and/or concomitant diagnosis invasive breast cancer DCIS Palpable abnormality diagnose core needle biopsy FEA IPWA Pathologic nipple discharge associate IPWA ( spontaneous bloody clear persistent single duct discharge ) A BIRADS 5 lesion Discordance initial breast image find core biopsy pathology report The presence atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH ) core biopsy Known current pregnancy . A pregnancy test require exclusion criterion . Women breastfeed Patient register study 60 day since date core needle biopsy .</criteria>
