	<brief_summary>Digoxin primary cardiac glycoside clinical use . Because narrow therapeutic index risk toxicity , therapeutic drug monitoring highly recommended . In Egypt , cardiologists give digoxin holiday atrial fibrillation heart failure , clear interrupt digoxin regimen effective since serum digoxin concentration might fall therapeutic range . Objective : To evaluate compare digoxin serum concentration patient 's quality life continuous versus interrupt digoxin dosing regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Different Digoxin Treatment Regimens Egyptian Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Digoxin cardiac glycoside prescribe heart failure certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias . It exert positive inotropic , neurohormonal , electro physiologic action heart . For heart failure patient , target steady state serum digoxin level 0.5 0.8 ng/ml . Ventricular rate control atrial fibrillation patient usually require high digoxin steady state serum concentration . However , serum digoxin level high 2 ng/ml associate increased incidence adverse drug reaction avoid . Because inter intra-patient variability , narrow therapeutic index , risk toxicity , digoxin dos calculate base patient weight , renal status , indication drug interaction . Due substantial overlap therapeutic toxic level digoxin , therapeutic drug monitoring must especially patient deteriorate renal function electrolyte disturbance . In Egypt , cardiologists give digoxin holiday patient atrial fibrillation /or heart failure patient skip drug dos Thursday Friday Friday every week avoid possible drug accumulation toxicity . It clear interrupted digoxin regimen really offer safe alternative continuous dose regimen without compromise effectiveness . It anticipate plasma digoxin level may fall therapeutic range holiday may affect patient clinical status quality life .</detailed_description>
