	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) group medical condition derive progressive bone marrow failure result ineffective production blood cell . Depending severity , MDS reduce quality life point life-threatening . There probability death stage disease , due complication co-morbidities , progression acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) bad evolution . Azacytidine nucleosidic analog original epigenetic mechanism action widely use treat variety myelodysplasic syndrome . Although generally well tolerate , severe sometimes life-threatening toxicity unexpectedly observe patient . Genetic polymorphism affect cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) , liver enzyme responsible azacytidine detoxification step , could responsible poor clinical outcome due one hand severe toxicity deficient patient , hand treatment failure ultrametabolizer patients.This clinical study aim correlate value CDA level risk drug-related toxicity clinical response azacytidine treatment .</brief_summary>
