	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) characterize collapse one pharyngeal structure sleep ( velum , tongue base , lateral wall , epiglottis ) . Structure-specific therapy OSA emerge alternative positive airway pressure ( PAP ) . Oral appliance ( OA ) therapy increasingly indicate OSA treatment , although complete response occur approximately 50 % patient . In general , OA device design maintain mandible and/or tongue protrude posture sleep , prevent upper airway obstruction . Limited study awake sedated patient demonstrated effect mandibular advancement aspect pharyngeal structure function . The objective propose research fully characterize upper airway collapse OSA patient natural sleep use information understand patient appear exhibit large improvement pharyngeal collapsibility whereas others .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterizing Upper Airway Collapse Guide Patient Selection Oral Appliance Therapy Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSA patient undergo baseline sleep endoscopy study identify site pharyngeal collapse . Subsequently , undergo two clinical polysomnographies ( PSGs ) measure effect oral appliance ( site specific therapy ) upper airway collapsibility sleep apnea severity . During first hour clinical PSG , passive pharyngeal collapsibility determine use standard 5-breath continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) drop method . During remainder night , patient monitor determine sleep apnea severity ( apnea-hypopnea index ) . These measurement allow investigator determine pharyngeal collapse site responds best ( term collapsibility AHI ) mandibular advancement oral appliance . Patients oral appliance recruit . In addition , patient without oral appliance provide temporary oral appliance study .</detailed_description>
