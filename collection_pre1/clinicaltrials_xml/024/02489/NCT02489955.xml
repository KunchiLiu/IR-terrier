	<brief_summary>Adult patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) treat high dose antibiotic reduce long term damage lung infection . This would typically two week course intravenous antibiotic time chest infection ( typically three four time year ) . The effective commonly use antibiotic case tobramycin . If use previous side effect , allergy resistant infection colomycin amikacin usually use . Each antibiotic know toxic kidney ear . As patient live long ( forty ) , total amount antibiotic receive lifetime increase . This lead increased complication kidney damage hearing loss . Because , investigator need look method accurately quantify damage reduce potential kidney hearing damage . The investigator intend quantify kidney damage measure new protein marker within urine blood signify kidney damage conventional currently available method able to.In patient treat intravenous tobramycin investigator also look alternative method use calculate appropriate dose antibiotic participant . This dose method call 'area curve AUC ' dose monitoring . This method currently clinical use country think accurately reflect appropriate dose participant thus reduce chance kidney hear problem . This 'AUC ' method require two rather one dose level check time dose calculation make . Participants receive tobramycin randomise receive dosing method investigator ' currently use method 'trough ' monitoring .</brief_summary>
