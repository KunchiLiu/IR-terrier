	<brief_title>RRx-001 Small , Non-small Cell Lung Cancer , Ovarian Cancer Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior Re-administration Platinum Based Doublet Regimens ( QUADRUPLE THREAT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , four-arm , three stage , pilot study co-administration RRx-001 autologous blood weekly progression follow reintroduction platinum-based doublet therapy . The study design explore potential epigenetic agent RRx-001 sensitize patient previously respond fail platinum base doublet . In first stage study three ( 3 ) subject SCLC , NSCLC , ovarian cancer HGNEC arm receive RRx-001 progression intolerable toxicity point platinum doublet therapy introduce reintroduce . The first three patient enrol safety assessment unacceptable toxicity . Each cohort initially enroll 3 patient assess safety . If one 3 patient enrol unexpected Adverse Events , combination would consider unacceptable cohort would stop . If unexpected AE occur additional patient enrol , total 10 patient per cohort . Each cohort undergo temporary pause 10 patient enrol assess safety efficacy . If great 1/3 patient ( 4 patient ) unexpected AE , cohort stop unacceptable toxicity . If completion enrollment 10 subject , least 1 need stable disease well . If arm 1/10 subject stable disease well , additional patient would enrol arm . Total patient enrol 31 patient NSCLC , 26 patient SCLC , 26 patient High Grade Neuroendocrine 26 Ovarian Cancer .</detailed_description>
