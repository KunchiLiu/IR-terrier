	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized trial conduct two clinical site , Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) Hospital University Pennsylvania ( HUP ) . Enrolled patient undergo trans-jugular liver biopsy hepatic vein pressure gradient ( HVPG ) measurement receive continuous infusion SonazoidÂ® ( GE Healthcare , Oslo , Norway ) co-infused 0.9 % NaCl solution 5-10 minute time period . Ultrasound image perform use Logiq 9 scanner 4C transducer ( GE Healthcare , Milwaukee , WI ) novel SHAPE ( subharmonic aid pressure estimation ) algorithm use measure pressure value hepatic portal vein . Data store PC compare pressure-catheter measurement , Subjects identify initial examination portal hypertension ( HVPG result ) monitor SHAPE 18 month . These subject typically surveillance Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan every 6 month screen liver cancer , time repeat SHAPE examination perform ( ideally within 1 month clinically indicate image follow appointment ) . In patient undergo frequent screening ( generally 3 month interval ) , SHAPE exams perform 6 month interval . Any repeat trans-jugular liver biopsy perform population also trigger repeat SHAPE study . Results blood test evaluation ( perform every 3 month population ) , medication , concomitant imaging study procedure ( include endoscopy ) note ( blood test image clinically indicate require protocol ) . The end point part study one new complication ( e.g. , liver cancer ) mark worsen complication , liver transplantation , death , end clinical trial ( 3 year ) . The investigator expect patient monitor three time course clinical trial . The time reach end point note new complication mark worsen complication occurs .</brief_summary>
