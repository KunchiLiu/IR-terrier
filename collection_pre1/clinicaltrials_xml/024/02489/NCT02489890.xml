	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy main treatment method patient Bladder Cancer . However , Relapse remain major cause treatment failure.Biological therapy CIK stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . A series study report cytokine-induced killer cell ( CIK ) broad anti-tumor spectrum . The investigator suppose CIK improve prognosis . Combining chemotherapy biological therapy may kill tumor cell . In study , patient treat CIK cell chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate efficacy CIK Bladder Cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CIK Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 1500 patient stag I-III Bladder Cancer , accept chemotherapy , randomly divide group A ( receive CIK treatment ) group B ( regularly follow ) , randomize ratio 1:1 . Patients group A receive 3 cycle CIK cell treatment ( every 12 week ) . Patients group B anti-tumor therapy .</detailed_description>
