While two randomized control trial ( RCTs ) substantial methodological problem lead intense discussion another RCT large case number , representative inclusion criterion consistent sound methodology reveal result mirror investigator ' clinical experience . In daily practice , investigator advance treatment concept routinely apply prophylactic augmentation VP use algorithm . Biomechanical study support approach , clinical study rare far .

	<brief_title>Study About Effect Preventive Adjacent Level Cement Augmentation After Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Despite current academic debate percutaneous vertebroplasty ( VP ) convincingly use treatment osteoporotic compression fracture around world . Polymethylmethacrylate bone cement directly inject fractured vertebral body one two bone biopsy needle stabilize fracture fragment possibly improve vertebral body height . The fracture pain represent significant burden patient , limit physical function , quality life increase social isolation . The immediate clinically relevant pain alleviation vertebroplasty therefore large impact patient ` mobility , autonomy quality life . The current state art treatment acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture nonresponsive conservative treatment still augmentation fracture VP balloon kyphoplasty ( BKP ) give intact posterior vertebral body wall . BKP claim saver reduce occurrence cement leakage effective reduce fracture , i.e . reconstitute vertebral body height . While first argument largely depend definition adverse event , i.e . asymptomatic radiologically visible cement leakage truly complication , second argument could hold promise since regain vertebral body height partially lose balloon deflation . This problem tackle developed BKP technology like vertebral body stenting ( VBS ) . From cost-effectiveness perspective , VP superior conservative medical care one postulate hence also cost-effective BKP much costly treatment option.In addition , prophylactic augmentation option `` destroy '' intact unfractured bone structure deployment balloon augment . It hence least aggressive augmentation option prophylaxis . Osteoporosis underlying disease lead increase risk fracture adjacent vertebral body , incidence 22 % first year . After fracture augmentation new fracture spine occur . This lead reoperations frail population high number American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) 3-4 patient . Any non-life-saving surgical intervention patient need avoided . Therefore , prophylactic augmentation adjacent non-fractured vertebral body treatment option safe may reduce reoperation rate . Since VP currently scientific clinical scrutiny call level-one-evidence become audible everywhere , investigator plan assess hypothesis prophylactic augmentation significantly decrease reoperation rate adjacent new fracture randomize controlled trial . Objective The aim propose study show effect preventive augmentation adjacent vertebral body 6 ( 12 ) month reoperation rate . Subjects acute ( &lt; = 6 week ) single level osteoporotic compression fracture , meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion randomize either single level fracture fixation vertebroplasty triple level augmentation VP fixation fracture additional prophylactic vertebroplasty adjacent level . The hypothesis prophylactic VP augmentation adjacent vertebral body acute single level osteoporotic compression fracture result significantly low reoperation rate new spinal fracture within 6 month surgery compare isolated single level fracture fixation . Methods This open label mono-center randomize control pilot trial . Given timeframe budget study , investigator aim conduct pilot trial clinically verify sample size calculation order sound basis information planning large multicenter trial . The inclusion primary case last 12 month , followup interval case 2 6 month since large majority new fracture appear within time window . 12 month followup conduct mail/telephone interview . Preliminary calculation result , i.e . new corrected sample size hence carry end one half year . Two treatment group compare : Group 1 : single level fracture fixation vertebroplasty , Group 2 : triple level augmentation VP fixation fracture additional prophylactic vertebroplasty adjacent level .</detailed_description>
