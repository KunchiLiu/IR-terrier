	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory demyelinate disease affect spinal cord ( especially posterior cord ) . The clinical heterogeneity MS well described , currently know lesion MS mechanisms underlie involved pathological destruction central nervous system ( CNS ) also heterogeneous . It multifactorial disease one immunopathogenic mechanism suggest responsible destruction sheath myelin . However , pathology inflammatory joint lesion MS suggest specific autoimmune response component CNS myelin may crucial role destruction myelin . This concept support high level oligoclonal immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) cerebrospinal fluid linkage locus major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) , expansion B T cell reactive myelin MS lesion fact immunization myelin proteins induces MS-like disease animal , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) . The autoreactivity various myelin protein , include myelin basic protein , proteolipid protein , myelin-associated glycoprotein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) , observed patient MS . It note however , T cell patient MS show predominant activity MOG relation myelin protein , anti-MOG antibody identify connected myelin 's disintegration around axon acute lesion MS . In addition , sensitization MOG reproduce clinical demyelinate degenerative pathology MS rodent model primate . An infectious etiology MS also postulate , several year , number different virus suggest trigger immunopathology . Increased title antibody detect , EBV , varicella zoster virus rubella virus , specific proteins human endogenous retrovirus ( HERV ) , particular HERV-W family detect blood brain lesion patient MS. HERV arise ancient infection host cell germline exogenous retrovirus today constitute 8 % human genome . The retrovirus multiple sclerosis-associated ( MRSV ) , envelop virus reverse transcriptase activity , represent prototype HERV-W family human genome . The MRSV isolate leptomeninges , choroid plexus culture monocytes/macrophages MS patient origin still investigation . Has suggest particle originate MSRV provirus HERV-W modify , transmitted member exogenous family . MSRV virion property superantigens , induce production cytokine mononuclear cell peripheral human blood . HERV particle associate reverse transcriptase activity ( RT ) confirm hallmark expression MSRV . A protocol detection MSRV virion RT PCR design detect presence serum cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient . Independent study patient MS control population show correlation MS MSRV prognosis , include conversion relapsing-remitting MS secondary progressive form ( SP-MS ) . Parallel study show immunopathogenesis MSRV virion identify envelope protein ( Env ) MSRV responsible pro-inflammatory superantigenicity immune . The Env antigen detect MS patient study brain postmortem . The trans-activation HERV-W promoter environmental virus associate MS also show induce epigenetic dysregulation HERV-W , present host genome . Certainly important herpes virus associate MS EBV , ratio EBV serology development MS extensively study . Furthermore , interaction EBV immune system undeniable lead persistent immune response immortalization lymphocytes . There also study correlate expression EBV great activity MS . Finally , interaction EBV endogenous retrovirus recent fascinating field study . EBV first member Herpesviridae family implicate potential cause MS 1971 . EBV possible candidate due several factor : widespread nature , require long quiescent viral infection continuous production due period reactivation modulate human immune system . The difficulty associate MS prove EBV virus infection occur onset autoimmune disease . Pohl et al . show EBV-seropositivity patient MS Europe ( child ) - 99 % high compare control group , virus antibody find 72 % . Levin et al . estimate time viral infection serum antibody titer MS compare control group . This study access medical record approximately 8 million employee US Army store blood sample . Of group , case-control study 305 people come later develop MS 610 control subject select pair ; 10 case develop MS 32 control initially EBV seronegative . All case become positive EBV MS , compare 35.7 % control seroconverted . Other study also attempt assess relationship antibody titer EBV onset MS . According work De Lorenze et al. , patient MS significant increase antibodies 20 year first symptoms MS . This fact explain two way : existence prior infection alter balance EBV receptor cell ( memory T cell ) reinfection different strain EBV . EBV infect B lymphocytes persistently highly immunogenic . The antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes produce continuously increased number response primary infection high viremia . This immune control essential prevent EBV-related malignancy . In modulate action , manage rescue infect B lymphocytes via expression latent antigens help differentiate memory B cell , virus persists . However , establish whether increase T cell specific EBV response increase stimulation specific recognition myelin antigen . EBV viral load high MS , addition , T cell specific virus seem distinguish cell host without MS. Another investigator state period MS reactivation increase activity virus replication relation period remission . Patients antibody response early antigen EBV likely show disease activity measure MRI gadolinium , compare patient without humoral response . These data lead u believe activity disease may relate latent EBV infection well disease progression . Studies correlate level antibody cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) MS controversial . Although result show high rate CMV infection patient MS , hand , milder presentation disease observe . Some investigator look presence anti-CMV antibody MS healthy individual . They find positive 98 % MS patient compare 52 % control group . Another investigator show patient antibody CMV : later age disease onset , low rate reactivation disease , few sign cerebral atrophy MRI . Those high titer antibody less brain atrophy few lesion image test , compare patient low titer . An animal model mimic pattern MS demonstrate animal CMV infection demyelinate frame clinical presentation weaker infect . These study suggest beneficial modulating effect CMV infection immune response MS . The herpesvirus ( HHV-6 HHV-7 ) closely related similar biological pattern . These virus able infect cell immune system modulate function . The work describe Krukle-Nora et al . attempted investigate association HHV-6 HHV-7 MS analyze peripheral blood patient . Patients randomly select divide 02 group : 14 patient relapse remit MS ( RR-MS ) 14 secondary progressive MS ( SP-MS ) . All study patient least 3 month without use immunosuppressive drug . Of 28 patient , 25 latent HHV-6 infection and/or HHV-7 . HHV-6 find 9 patient RR-MS 9 SP-MS. HHV-7 find 10 patient RR-MS 14 SP-MS. Two investigator use technique fluorescent situ hybridization , human cadaveric tissue examine evaluate expression early late viral gene white matter affect tissue patient MS brain sample without disease . The gene HHV-6 find sample restrict oligodendrocyte . Quantitative analysis expression viral RNA show group MS patient ( brain tissue without change white matter ) sample significantly high level expression virus . Furthermore , show injured tissue correlate high viral expression , fact contributes theory HHV-6 implicate pathogenesis MS . Using method virus observe conflicting result . In fact technology use capable distinguish active latent infection HHV-6 ( analysis leukocytes blood , cerebrospinal fluid contain cell tissue CNS ) , difference find among samples patient control group . However , diagnostic technology use specifically detection activity HHV-6 , strong correlation HHV-6 pathogenesis MS observe . Our group recently investigate level similarity envelope protein HERV-W MOG . A comparison envelope MOG identify five IgG-like domain MOG-like extend idea HERV-W may involve immunopathogenesis MS , perhaps facilitate recognition immune system MOG retroviral region . We also show patient show expression HERV-W envelope level . Nine ten test sample medium high level HERV-W envelope expression low expression level activity healthy control , confirm association MS activity HERV-W population . A recent study Italy show EBV stimulates expression HERV-W cell blood brain vitro . They suggest pathogenesis MS , possible model could include EBV initial trigger MS , year later , show HERV-W real pathogenicity MS , strike parallel behavior disease remit form contributor appellant . Objectives : Primary Objective : correlate clinical image MS activity quantitative assessment HERV-W virus Herpesviridae family blood patient MS . Secondary Objective : Assess expression HERV-W Herpesvirus compare virus expression among patient MS healthy control without neurological disease . Significance : MS multifactorial disease , genetic environmental etiology . It great interest researcher associate factor establish causal relationship . Several virus link pathogenesis disease activity . Although herpesvirus HERV-W virus important attempt establish causal relationship activity MS , many question remain open role virus etiology development disease . Hypothesis : With work expect find possible answer etiopathogenesis inflammatory activity relate MS , thus , provide consistent data help formulation increasingly specific effective therapy direct pathology . Methods : Initially , sample analyze ELISA immunoassay detection IgG immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) anti-EBV CMV antibodies serum participant , use commercial kit . The nucleic acid extraction perform ( DNA RNA ) , accord manufacturer 's instruction . All protocols ensure purity RNA absence DNA sample adopt analyze expression ( thus detection transcript ) . Thus , nucleic acid subject treatment DNAse verification RT-PCR HERV-W. Only sample contain RNA transcribe subject analysis . RNA quantification HERV-W make mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) specific subtype MSRV HERV-W family . The detection herpesvirus DNA initially make PCR , use two set primer ( HSVPAN VZVPAN ) . After amplification carry enzymatic digestion BamHI BstUI type herpesvirus eight type include human herpesvirus 6 ( 6A 6B ) . For sample prove positive , qRT-PCR hold specific virus . Design : A prospective , longitudinal study collect biological material presence control group hold . This project analyzed individual , term free inform consent . Only sign consent form patient able participate survey . Blood sample patient neurology outpatient clinic ( CATEM specialty ) do routine visit qualify professional . The blood patient Blood Bank collect conjunction examination routinely perform . All material collect sent virology laboratory Institute Tropical Medicine , University São Paulo , laboratory test perform . Patients assess degree clinical imaging disease activity analyze annualized rate relapse , EDSS-scale increase increase cranial lesion MRI disease activity classify MILD , MODERATE SEVERE accord propose criterion Freedman et al . The cranial MRI perform group MS neurological disease . Statistical Methods : After laboratory test result , data analyze receive necessary treatment statistical interpretation comparison activity disease use parametric non-parametric tool . The Student-t Mann-Whitney test use evaluate association clinical , demographic laboratory parameter . The significance level alpha = 0.05 5 % reject null hypothesis fix . Sample Size Calculation : The sample size determine base percentage population without MS show detectable expression HERV-W PBMC . Although number patient MS exhibit activity retrovirus envelope close 95 % , assume conservative value sample calculation . Therefore , assume expression 50 % 10 % case control , respectively , sample size 28 case 28 control necessary , base confidence level = 95 % power detect 80 % , accord Kelsey-method . Thus , investigator analyze three group ( MS , without MS neurological disease ) total N 84 subject , 28 per group .</detailed_description>
