	<brief_summary>The objective research determine whether MyotonPRO valid reliable application facial , head neck surgery . In addition , study aim compare new technology current electromyography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Device Evaluate Neuromuscular Function Assessing Muscle Facial Paralysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Facial paralysis significant aesthetic , functional psycho-social morbidity . The diagnosis monitoring neuromuscular recovery limit clinical examination , electromyography ( EMG ) electroneurography ( ENoG ) . EMG ENoG invasive patient practical cost disadvantage . The MyotonPRO handheld device , pain-free quick use . Therefore research assess MyotonPRO technology clinical application may effective evaluate rehabilitative surgical intervention . Phase 1 - Variation measurement Phase 2 - Mimic muscle dysfunction assessment Phase 3 - Peri-operative Mimic temporalis muscle assessment Phase 4 - Phase 3 include electromyography Phase 5 - Temporalis mimic muscle assessment follow facial reanimation surgery</detailed_description>
