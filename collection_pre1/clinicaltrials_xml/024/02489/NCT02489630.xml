	<brief_summary>This study investigate use low dos ketamine , along opiate pain medication , effective control acute pain patient emergency department opiate pain medication alone . In addition , study examines whether patient treat low dos ketamine , along opiate pain medication , require less opiate pain medication control pain , whether patient equally happy pain control patient receive opiate pain medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Ketamine Adjunct Opiates Acute Pain Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind , placebo control study investigates use low-dose ketamine , conjunction standard opiate treatment , compare placebo plus standard opiate treatment , acute painful condition ED setting . The investigator hypothesize patient treated ketamine require less opiate similar level pain relief 2 hour initiation treatment , similar level patient satisfaction acceptable side effect profile . Once see physician , potential patient receive provider-determined opiate treatment painful condition , prior informed consent process ensure treatment delay . Once identified inclusion , patient receive informed consent , upon consent , subsequently randomize block randomization one two study group . Each study group contain least 50 subject . Randomization determine use table random number , use restrict randomization scheme ensure roughly equal number group . Group assignments seal opaque envelope open sequentially investigator . Group assignments indicate whether treatment control group . At time ( T0 ) , initial NRS-11 score obtain . The NRS-11 11-point scale patient rate level pain 0 ( `` pain '' ) 10 ( `` worst pain imaginable '' ) . If , initial analgesic , pain level &lt; 6 , patient ask 15 min . If time still &lt; 6 , proceed study . The intervention group receive 0.1 mg/kg ketamine give 1 minute , control group receive equivalent volume normal saline ; group receive provider-determined dose opiate analgesia prior enrollment . At thirty-minute interval , subject ask level pain , need pain control evaluate presence side effect ( hallucination , dysphoria , weakness , diplopia , nausea , vomit , dizziness , itch bradypnea ) well sedation define Ramsay score great 2 . Repeat dose pain medication give 0.05 mg/kg morphine equivalent dose opioid analgesic . Total opiate dosage number repeat dos give end 120 minute record . At time interval , well end 120 minute ( T120 ) , patient satisfaction pain control recode 4-point Likert scale , 0 `` completely unsatisfied '' 3 `` satisfied '' .</detailed_description>
