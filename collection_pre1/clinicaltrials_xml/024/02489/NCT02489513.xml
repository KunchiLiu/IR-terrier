	<brief_title>Study Investigate Absorption , Metabolism , Excretion 14C-AG-120</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , study healthy adult male . Each subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase , follow period . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion screen return clinical site Day -1 baseline assessment . Following 10 hour overnight fast , subject receive single 500mg dose AG-120 suspension contain microtracer [ 14C ] AG-120 ( ~ 200 μCi ) fast condition . The study drug administer oral suspension approximately 240 mL room temperature , non-carbonated water . Blood , urine , fecal sample ( vomitus , applicable ) collect throughout study pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , mass balance , and/or clinical laboratory assessment . Safety monitor throughout study . Subjects discharge clinical site Day 22 Day 29 , depend recovery eliminate radioactivity . Urine fecal sample collect day Day 29 ( point discharge earlier ) measurement total [ 14C ] radioactivity . Blood sample radioanalysis PK assessment , inclusive metabolite profiling/characterization , collect pre-dose specified interval Day 29 . Total [ 14C ] -radioactivity whole blood , plasma , urine , feces ( vomitus , applicable ) determine . Up 8 subject enroll study . One two additional subject confirm poor metabolizer ( PM ) CYP2D6 genotype may enrol .</detailed_description>
