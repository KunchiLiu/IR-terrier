	<brief_summary>Hypotension frequently encounter induction general anesthesia . It pronounce elderly patient require administration vasopressor agent include ephedrine phenylephrine . Intraoperative hypotension , especially prolonged episode , contribute increase morbidity mortality postoperative period suggest former study . The investigator hypothesize fentanyl contribute decrease blood pressure ( BP ) see induction general anesthesia old patient . This hypotension may due fentanyl block effect sympathetic nervous system . This study first one examine effect fentanyl administration blood pressure elderly patient induction general anesthesia prior start surgery . If study show fentanyl contributes hypotension period , may lead change practice well patient outcomes mortality rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective double-blinded randomize control trial ( RCT ) patient assign randomly investigational pharmacist . Patients assign one three group : ( 1 ) A control group receive 0.9 mcg/kg sodium chloride ( NaCL ) , ( 2 ) fentanyl group receive 1 mcg/kg fentanyl , ( 3 ) fentanyl group receive 2 mcg/kg fentanyl . The definition intraoperative hypotension study define mean blood pressure ( MAP ) less 25 % compare baseline value ( i.e. , participant ' first blood pressure read enter operating room ) . All study drug agent dispense pharmacy five milliliter syrinx label `` study medication '' . The volume three study medication adjust pharmacist reflect equal volume .</detailed_description>
