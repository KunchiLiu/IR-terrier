	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Perform preliminary assessment efficacy single-agent enzalutamide , base overall response rate , subject relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) previously untreated MCL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate duration disease control ( progression free survival ) patient MCL treat enzalutamide . II . To evaluate safety profile enzalutamide MCL . III . To gain preliminary data clinical activity toxicity regimen male versus ( vs. ) female patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses 1-3 repeat every 4 week ( 28 day ) subsequent course repeat every 12 week ( 84 day ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
