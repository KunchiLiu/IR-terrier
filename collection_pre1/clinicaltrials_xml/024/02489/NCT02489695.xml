	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) account 2-3 % adult malignancy worldwide , represent seventh common cancer men ninth woman . The annual incidence 337 000 case around 140 000 person die every year . Half patient RCC go develop metastasis , either synchronous metastatic site ( 25 % ) follow ( 25 % ) . Papillary renal cell carcinoma ( PRCC ) represent 10-15 % RCC characterize cytogenetic profile distinct type renal cancer . Histologically , PRCC could separate 2 distinct subtypes : type 1 type 2 . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) potent induction factor , play central role angiogenesis vascular permeability tumor tissue . It bind three specific receptor : VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 , thus implicate pathologic angiogenesis , tumor growth metastatic progression cancer . Patients papillary histology demonstrate high expression VEGF VEGFR-2 , make VEGF-targeted therapy attractive therapeutic option . Recently , several study develop assess VEGF target therapy patient PRCC , mostly sunitinib poor result ( median progression-free survival ( PFS ) around 6 month ) . Axitinib potent , selective second-generation inhibitor three VEGF receptor . By inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation survival , axitinib inhibits angiogenesis tumor growth . In phase II trial , axitinib show anti-tumor activity well-tolerated clinical safety profile patient advance solid tumor , include RCC . Axitinib approve second-line treatment advance RCC basis pivotal randomize phase III AXIS trial result . 723 patient enrol randomly assign receive axitinib sorafenib . The median PFS assess independent review committee 6.7 month axitinib compare 4.7 month sorafenib ( hazard ratio 0.665 ; 95 % CI 0.544-0.812 ; one-sided p &lt; 0.0001 ) . In study , safety analysis show good tolerance axitinib . The common adverse reaction ( occur &gt; 20 % treated subject ) diarrhea , hypertension , fatigue , decrease appetite , nausea , dysphonia hand-foot skin reaction . Dose discontinuation report 4 % patient axitinib vs. 8 % sorafenib . Little clinical data regard efficacy recently develop VEGF target therapy first-line treatment PRCC available . To date , standard treatment , evaluation efficacy new target agent clearly need . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety axitinib first-line treatment patient papillary renal cell carcinoma . Axitinib inhibit angiogenesis vascular permeability tumor tissue , lead inhibition tumor growth . Axitinib show antitumor activity patient RCC phase II III clinical trial . VEGF inhibitor currently use PRCC treatment , disappointing result . Axitinib potent selective VEGFR family compare sorafenib sunitinib biochemical assay , could similar efficacy lesser toxicity , therefore may provide clinical benefit patient PRCC .</detailed_description>
