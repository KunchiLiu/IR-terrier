	<brief_summary>This study look effect useful investigational drug olaparib neoadjuvant treatment ( treatment give shrink tumor main treatment ) prior surgery patient recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Olaparib Prior Surgery Chemotherapy Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Olaparib belongs class anti-cancer agent know poly ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor . Olaparib new type drug ovarian cancer . Laboratory test show may help slow growth ovarian cancer . Olaparib work block PARP protein . PARP important protein try fix damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA , molecules contain important instruction development cell ) . Many cancer think develop damage DNA . Research show PARP inhibitor stop PARP protein work , sometimes cause cancer cell stop grow die .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven recurrent high grade serous ovarian/primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . Patients must disease amenable preoperative biopsy . Patients must disease deem suitable surgical debulking . Patients must progression free interval least 6 month prior registration . Patients must least one line platinum base therapy . Patients must show platinum sensitivity last line platinum therapy Age &gt; =18 year ECOG performance status 01 within 7 day registration Life expectancy great 3 month Patients must normal organ marrow function Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subject 's willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition olaparib . History allergic reaction attribute platinum precluding use . Radiation therapy within 4 week registration Use systemic , target , immunotherapy , chemotherapy , investigational agent within 4 week registration Previously receive PARP inhibitor Other malignancy within last 2 year exception Patients consider poor medical risk due serious , uncontrolled medical disorder , nonmalignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled infection . Patients unable swallow orally administer medication patient gastrointestinal disorder likely interfere absorption study medication . Concomitant use know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor Concomitant use know potent CYP3A4 inducer Other anticancer therapy include immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy , novel agent investigational agent Persistent toxicity ( CTCAE v 4.03 grade &gt; 2 ) cause previous cancer therapy , exclude alopecia Patients myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia Patients brain metastasis Immunocompromised patient , e.g. , patient know serologically positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Patients know active hepatitis ( i.e. , hepatitis B C ) due risk transmit infection blood body fluid Pregnant breastfeed woman Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
