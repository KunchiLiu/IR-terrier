	<brief_summary>Parastomal hernia ( PSH ) one frequent stoma complication high impact patient ' quality life . Half stoma create year permanent 50 % patient develop PSH . PSH rate depend type ostomy , ileo- colostomy . End colostomy carry high risk PSH ( 48 % ) . PSH lead recurrent pain , poor fit appliance leakage therefore , skin irritation , also complicate strangulation occlusion . The literature report 30 % patient PSH require surgery . There many different surgical procedure repair PSH : primary fascia repair , relocation stoma repair various type mesh . Despite effort do improve technique , incidence recurrent PSH 70 % dependent use technique . Therefore , idea implant mesh time initial stoma formation lately advocate . A new device , KoringKM , stomaplasty ring make propylene , flexible non-absorbable , create . This study try prove incorporation new stomaplasty ring time stoma creation diminish long-term PSH rate . This hypothesis improve patient 's quality life reduce cost associate PSH . All patient require permanent ostomy ( ileostomy colostomy ) malignant disease fulfil inclusion criterion eligible participate trial . The patient randomize 24 48 hour prior surgery give write informed consent . The implantation Koring perfomed experienced surgeon ( expertise base , best team approach ) already implant Koring ( e.g . participate observational study ) and/or review video documentation . The surgeon fill first form data patient surgical procedure . The surgical wound daily examine . A second form fill 30 post-operative day visit . The patient ask inform surgeon and/or investigator side event suspicion infection occur hospital discharge . The next follow-up visit one two year include clinical examination abdominal CT. At moment , 3rd 4th form document . All data anonymised included Excel database .</brief_summary>
