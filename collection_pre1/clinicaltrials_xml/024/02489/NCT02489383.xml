	<brief_summary>The treatment asthma base clinical control . However , previous study show patient participate program regular aerobic continuous exercise training ( CT ) present improvement physical conditioning , quality life , well decreased level anxiety depression , reduce oxide nitric exhale leukocyte migration airway reduce airway hyperresponsiveness . The regular exercise also important part rehabilitation lung disease well chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Additionally , others study show effect high intensity interval training ( IT ) pulmonary rehabilitation COPD patient , perform IT present reduction dyspnea , increase physical capacity . In sense , impact IT asthmatic patient present moment poorly study , necessity investigation prove efficiency training model asthma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Continuous Versus Interval Exercise Training Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study compare impact IT CT patient moderate severe asthma , investigate efficient increase physical capacity , quality life reduces inflammatory mediator . Sixty asthmatic adult randomly assign two group : CT ( Continuous train ) IT ( Interval training ) . CT treatment 2x week , 40 min./session , 60-75 % maximum heart rate intensity IT also 2x week , 40 min./session , 80-140 % maximum load intensity , perform ergometer cycle 24 week .</detailed_description>
