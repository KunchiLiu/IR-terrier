	<brief_title>Major Complications Related PICC Midline Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A PICC line Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter . It long , small , flexible tube insert peripheral vein , typically upper arm , terminate large vein chest obtain central intravenous access . A Midline catheter similar PICC , short length ( 25 cm ) insert large vein upper arm , terminate beyond axillary vein . Midline catheter offer long dwell time good hemodilution short peripheral IV catheters.The use PICC Midline increase outpatient inpatient setting . Factors drive increase use include ease insertion due placement peripheral vein—a safer approach—with benefit central tip location appropriate osmolarity pH infusion , low report incidence infection , good patient comfort , durable venous access , easy nursing management outpatient set . PICC placement ultrasound guidance carry iatrogenic , mechanical complication associate central venous catheter insertion neck chest ( pneumothorax , hemothorax etc… ) . Despite many advantage , recent data suggest PICCs associate venous thromboembolism . The incidence symptomatic thrombosis range 1.9 % 8.4 % increase 75 % consider also asymptomatic one . The risk factor predispose patient development thrombotic complication : caliber device ( ≥5Fr ) , position catheter tip , insertion PICC paretic limb , history venous thrombosis , residence time device presence oncological pathology . The second major complication due PICC insertion catheter relate blood stream infection ( CRBSI ) . The incidence PICC-BSI literature range 2.0 per 1000 catheter day 3.1 per 1000 catheter day . This disparity stem fact single definition catheter infection . Multiple factor associate patient catheter care identify increase risk CRBSI amenable preventive measure . Independent risk factor PICC BSIs include congestive heart failure , intrabdominal perforation , Clostridium difficile infection , recent chemotherapy , presence tracheostomy , type catheter ( double tri lumen ) . Limited data exists regard prospective observational study deep vein thrombosis CRBSI relate PICC Midline insertion , include different caliber device presence single multiple lumen . The investigator design multicenter prospective observational study determine incidence deep vein thrombosis , related/associated catheter blood stream infection incidence minor complication due PICC Midline insertion .</detailed_description>
