	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study side effect well pembrolizumab cryosurgery work short term androgen ablation treat patient prostate cancer travel original tumor , body , form small number new tumor part body ( oligo-metastatic ) . Cryosurgery , also know cryoablation cryotherapy , kill tumor cell freeze . The process also incite immune response within ablated tumor . Giving monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab enhance systemic anti-cancer immune response , may augment effect cryosurgery increase tumor kill distant ( metastatic ) site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Cryosurgery Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed , Oligo-metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility via proportion men reach low prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) nadir ( &lt; 0.6 ng/ml ) 1 year . II . Evaluate safety cryotherapy prostate combine pembrolizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect combination cryotherapy / pembrolizumab program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression prostate assess biopsy perform 6 month post treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive standard care androgen ablation degarelix subcutaneously ( SC ) month 8 month . Within 1 month receive degarelix , patient receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 day receive first dose pembrolizumab , patient undergo whole gland cryoablation prostate . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
