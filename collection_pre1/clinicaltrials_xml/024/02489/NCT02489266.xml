	<brief_summary>Background : - One cancer therapy involve take white blood cell person , change lab , give cell back person . These cell call tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) . Researchers want grow TIL cell drug Akti see live long grow without . Objectives : - To see TIL cell grown Akti live longer grow without . Eligibility : - Adults 18 70 metastatic melanoma Design : - Participants : - Be screen test include scan , x-ray , heart lung test , blood urine test , &lt; TAB &gt; possible colonoscopy . - Have tumor surgery biopsy . - Have large catheter insert vein upper chest . - Receive leukapheresis 4 5 hour . Blood remove needle arm . White blood cell &lt; TAB &gt; remove . The rest blood return needle arm . - The cell change laboratory . - Participants check hospital : - For 5 day , get 1 2 chemotherapy drug catheter . - For 1 3 day , get change cell catheter . - For several day , get 2 drug stimulate cell , one injection , catheter . - For 7 12 day , recover hospital . - After treatment , participant : - Take antibiotic antiviral least 6 month . - Return NIH several 2-day visit year . At visit , participant lab test , image study , physical exam . At visit , may leukapheresis blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Persistence Adoptively-Transferred TIL Cultured With Akti People With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive cellular immunotherapy ( ACT ) use autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - Regression tumor mouse model human strongly correlate anti-tumor T cell exhibit feature immunologic memory capacity persist long period adoptive-transfer tumor-bearing host . - In preclinical work TIL , identify pharmacologic inhibitor AKT promote feature immunologic memory TIL ( evidence transcriptomic , proteomic , metabolomic , functional assay describe Background section ) . Consistently , AKT inhibition human TIL significantly enhance persistence adoptive-transfer immunodeficient mouse model . - We therefore aim evaluate whether pharmacologic inhibition AKT TIL may enhance persistence adoptive-transfer patient advance melanoma . Objectives : - Primary objective : - To determine whether ACT use TIL culture pharmacologic inhibitor AKT ( ex vivo expansion ) result enhance vivo persistence TIL adoptive transfer autologous patient advance melanoma . - Secondary objective : - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . - Determine whether ACT use combination AKTi-treated conventional TIL mediate tumor regression RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) guideline patient advanced melanoma . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 less equal 70 year - Evaluable metastatic melanoma - Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable surgical resection preparation TIL - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency Design : - Patients metastatic melanoma undergo ACT conventional manner , exception half tumor fragment TIL isolate cultured presence pharmacologic AKT inhibitor . Prior infusion TIL , AKT inhibitor ( hereafter AKTi ) wash therapeutic TIL product systemically administer . Each patient receive 1:1 mixture conventional TIL AKTi-treated TIL . To evaluate persistence AKTi-treated conventional TIL adoptive co-transfer , perform high-throughput deep sequencing TCR V-beta CDR3 region TIL infusion-bag peripheral blood sufficient lymphocyte reconstitution ( &gt; 200 lymphocytes/microliter ) occur approximately 4-6 week infusion . - Up 20 patient may enrol 20-24 month .</detailed_description>

Confirmation diagnosis metastatic melanoma Laboratory Pathology NCI . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . Prior therapy least one first line standard therapy include check point inhibitor pembrolizumab , nivolumab , ipilimumab . Note : Six week must elapse time prior antibody therapy could affect anticancer immune response , time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . Note : Patients previously receive ipilimumab document GI toxicity must normal colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . Willing sign durable power attorney . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 . Life expectancy great three month . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month treatment . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm^3 without support filgrastim WBC great equal 3000/mm^3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum Creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must progressive disease prior treatment . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less . Six week must elapse time antibody therapy could affect anti cancer immune response , include antiCTLA4 antibody therapy , time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . Note : Patients previously receive ipilimumab document GI toxicity must colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) .
