	<brief_summary>Providing patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) access remote monitoring , example telephone telemonitoring use wireless technology , reduces deaths hospitalisation may provide benefit health care cost quality life . Remote monitoring patient chronic heart failure reduce pressure resource , particularly condition like chronic heart failure , exert large burden health service . These conclusion Cochrane Systematic Review 2010 . In Norway cost treatment chronic heart failure vast , concern hospital treatment , daily use medication year , loss quality life patient family caregiver . Generally little knowledge gain billion use . In Norway telemonitoring service establish hence investigation yet publish . Thus seem current evidence effectiveness quality insufficient recommend usage . The structure funding streams Norwegian health service different country conventional service intervention compare previous study , likely heterogeneous . It thus important investigate Norwegian condition . Advanced telemonitoring technology electronic transfer physiological data blood pressure weight currently use research establish routine service several country Europe , amongst Netherlands , Germany United Kingdom . The propose project intend introduce strategy avenue explore promise new service would otherwise available Norway . The service consist daily monitor patient ' weight blood pressure directly home ; automatically securely transmit value server University Hospital North Norway ( UNN ) ; monitor value train nurse Heart polyclinic . The primary objective study thus explore whether , compare current care Heart Polyclinic , introduction home telemonitoring reduce hospital readmission , addition , cost-effective . This line current direction European telemonitoring programme patient chronic heart failure . This result may define telemonitoring heart failure patient feasible Norway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHF Home Telemonitoring : A Home Telemonitoring Service Chronic Heart Failure Patients Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All data collect equipment place patient 's home directly securely transfer Heart polyclinic University Hospital North Norway ( UNN ) . All data anonymous explain , weight code answer questionnaire send . Each day nurse assign responsible heart remote monitoring system . The nurse charge must read heart remote monitoring email morning every day , seven day week . If alert email receive , nurse log system 's dashboard read data display patient . Then nurse try phone patient clarify situation . Until moment procedure protocol differs ordinary routine notification case usually raise phone call patient hospitalisation . But moment , procedure protocol patient treat Heart polyclinic , i.e . nurse evaluate situation need follow-up , nurse contact patient 's general practitioner ( GP ) phone ( say procedure usual ) . The hospital 's Heart polyclinic responsibility treatment patient , intervention arm control arm . Each one patient assign intervention arm follow procedure 6 month . For patient assign control arm receive treatment usual also period 6 month . Data store system anonymised . All patient uniquely identify number , Unique Identifier ( UID ) , system , connection UID real identity store file secure personal computer unconnected network , stay office heart polyclinic . Once week , UIDs ' file store study personal computer Heart polyclinic transfer hardware protect pen drive . The pen drive place another building UNN . This procedure responsibility UNN 's department `` E-health information communication technology ( ICT ) '' . In way two copy file store separate building . No reference study name mention file . As pilot study , prototype platform build . It consist wireless weight scale also blood pressure meter prepare send value home Wi-Fi network connect portable computer . The portable computer could send encrypted measurement server UNN . After first two month pilot test , patient satisfied usability solution reliability service proven . The platform deploy test pilot study extend include functionality multiple patient . A dashboard showing measurement receive ( unidentified ) develop polyclinic use responsible clinician ( nurse daily duty ) . This data unidentified consist registration blood pressure weight , encode answer questionnaire attach ( example : Q3A2 mean question 3 get answer 2 questionnaire ) . The responsible nurse Heart Polyclinic access dashboard . When situation require nurse intervention arises , system send alert email pre-defined address ( usually nurse 's email account do study ) . The design randomize control trial ( RCT ) Power analysis The inclusion 40 patient base upon total number new patient serve polyclinic per year 2 last year . For study sample size calculate base readmission rate 70 % patient per year average standard deviation 20pp ( percentage point ) . The value adequate , base patient receive treatment within Heart Polyclinic also replicate study Antonicelli , publish Journal telemedicine Telecare `` Impact telemonitoring home management elderly patient congestive heart failure '' 2008 . It assume clinical team 1/3 reduction rate readmission ( 47 % ) would clinically relevant margin superiority intervention . To 95 % certainty ( power ) test 0.05 level significance would find statistically significant difference mean , study would include minimum 20 patient group . The planned RCT The telemonitoring service offer patient admit UNN 's Heart Polyclinic , satisfy inclusion criterion . The study comprise intervention arm testing propose telemonitoring service control arm current treatment . Patients assign intervention arm receive home telemonitoring kit consist tablet , wireless weight scale portable blood pressure meter . The patient ask weigh him- every day monitor procedure happen previously describe . In addition measurement blood pressure also make . Patients assign control arm receive treatment usual , consist recommendation weigh home , use weight scale , report phone polyclinic significant change weight . The study calendar show . Recruiting period : 14 month Follow-up period : 6 month Number patient : 40 Randomization : perform use sequentially number seal opaque envelope Blinding : independent outcome assessor data analyst blind group patient assign ( patient blind due nature intervention ) . Challenges opportunities Qualitative research semi structure interview . Patients intervention group health care professional ask state opinion service . The research team also observe patient ' interaction system 6 month study . A qualitative summary thematic analysis significant feature opinion action connect best practice . The purpose able understand best practice develop Northern Norwegian context , describe mechanism . The innovation intention adjust service develop , consider identify additional condition future development . Ethics privacy With recent event advance information technology Internet , confidentiality regard handle patient private data become critical aspect study design privacy fundamental right public healthcare domain . In project confidentiality private health information ensure accord Health Personnel Act ยง 21 , helsepersonelloven ยง 21 , describe LOV2001-05-18 nr.24 ( Helse- og omsorgsdepartementet , 2001 ) . All private personal data de-identified : every unique identify number , characteristic , code identifier individual relative , employer , household member individual remove information use alone combination information . The result data analyse statistician ensure individually identifiable health information remain . The consent participant require mean provide letter inform consent sign .</detailed_description>
