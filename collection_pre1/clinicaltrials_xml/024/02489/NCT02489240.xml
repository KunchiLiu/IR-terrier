	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Vitamin D Treat Contrast-induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D primarily generate skin , response direct absorption ultraviolet B radiation . Vitamin D also obtain fortify food oral supplement . Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) generally reversible form acute kidney injury occur mostly within 2-3 day exposure contrast medium ( CM ) . The estimated incidence CIN range 2 % -50 % , coronary angiography ( CAG ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , , associate CIN half case . Recently low vitamin D status show associate increase risk CIN . However , effect CIN patient remain unclear . The investigator plan determine efficacy vitamin D incidence contrast-induced nephropathy patient undergo coronary angiography . This study may shed light whether oral vitamin D supplementation adjunct therapy CIN patient .</detailed_description>
