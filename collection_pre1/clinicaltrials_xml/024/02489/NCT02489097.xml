	<brief_summary>The study substudy Enigma2 trial aim investigate effectiveness safety nitrous oxide ( N2O ) anaesthesia.The substudy focus postoperative cognitive disorder . Substudy Hypothesis : In patient undergo anaesthesia major surgery , administration N2O reduce postoperative cognitive disorder compare otherwise identically manage surgical patient receive N2O component anaesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Numerous study question routine use nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , old anaesthetic agent use since development anaesthesia care . Despite wide use , sufficient doubt risk-benefit profile . There strong evidence N2O major risk factor postoperative nausea vomit . It clear ( even ) brief exposure N2O impair methionine synthetase , enzyme require DNA production , red white blood cell formation . Tissue hypoxia may common . These adverse effect enhance `` sick '' patient ( ie . high risk , increase hospital length stay healthcare expenditure ) , likely longer surgery . At time , observational study subgroup analysis publish trial suggest N2O may beneficial effect prevent pain postoperative cognitive disorder Outcome trial data postoperative cognitive disorder lack area anaesthetic gas use 90 % surgery around world . The enigma2 substudy nest study large Enigma2 randomise control trial aim answer question . The investigator aim recruit 420 patient 2 25 centre participate Enigma 2 trial , undergo major surgery .</detailed_description>
