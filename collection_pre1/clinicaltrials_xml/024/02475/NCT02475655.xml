	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Tolerability Ruxolitinib Antiretroviral-Treated HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ruxolitinib medication approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat myelofibrosis , disorder bone marrow replace scar ( fibrosis ) tissue . Many cytokine affect myelofibrosis also affect HIV . Because , ruxolitinib may also possible treatment HIV . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability ruxolitinib HIV-infected adult ART virologically suppress . Researchers evaluate effect ruxolitinib inflammation immune activation . This study enroll HIV-infected adult select ART regimens viral suppression . ART provide study ; participant continue receive ART health care provider . Participants randomly assign receive either ruxolitinib ( Arm A ) study treatment ( Arm B ) . Participants Arm A receive ruxolitinib twice day 5 week . All participant attend study visit entry ( Day 0 ) Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 12 . These visit include physical examination , clinical assessment , blood collection , adherence assessment , oral swab collection , pregnancy test female participant . At Weeks 1 4 , participant Arm A take part pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sampling , involve blood drawn several time 6 8 hour .</detailed_description>

More information criterion available protocol . CD4+ T cell count great 350 cells/mm^3 within 45 day prior study entry U.S. laboratory CLIA ( Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ) certification equivalent Documentation virologic suppression define : Have virologic suppression define HIV1 RNA level limit quantification ( eg , less 40 , less 50 , less 75 copies/mL , depend assay ) use FDAapproved assay quantification limit 75 copies/mL low least 48 week prior study entry perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . Single determination assay quantification limit 500 copies/mL ( ie , `` blip '' ) allow long preceding subsequent determination level quantification . The screen value may serve subsequent undetectable value follow blip . Screening HIV1 RNA level limit quantification ( eg , less 20 , less 40 , less 50 , less 75 copies/mL , depend assay ) use FDAapproved assay quantification limit 75 copies/mL low perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent within 45 day prior study entry . Tuberculosis ( TB ) screen within 365 day screen visit diagnose tuberculin skin test interferon gamma release assay Currently continuous ART least 730 day prior study entry , define continuous ART 730 day period , inclusive , prior study entry ART interruption longer 7 consecutive day . NOTE : The current regimen must include TDF/FTC , TAF/FTC , TDF+3TC , ABC/3TC ; plus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor integrase strand transfer inhibitor ( NNRTI INSTI , contain cobicistat ) least 60 day , inclusive , prior study entry . The following laboratory value obtain within 45 day prior entry U.S. laboratory CLIA certification equivalent : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin great equal 12.0 g/dL Platelets great equal 200,000/mm^3 Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great 80 mL/min , great equal 70 mL/min participant DTGcontaining regimen ( Cockcroft Gault equation ) .

If still uncertain , site contact protocol team ( actg.corea5336 @ fstrf.org ) assist determination . Change ART regimen within 12 week , inclusive , prior study entry intend modification ART study . NOTE : Modifications ART dose 12 week prior study entry permit . In addition , change formulation ( e.g. , standard formulation fixeddose combination ) allow within 12 week prior study entry . A within class single drug substitution ( e.g. , switch nevirapine efavirenz atazanavir darunavir ) allow within 12 week prior study entry , exception switch NRTI to/from abacavir . No change ART within 12 week prior study entry permit . However , participant need receive ( tolerate ) allowable ( study purpose ) ART regimen least 4 week prior study entry .
