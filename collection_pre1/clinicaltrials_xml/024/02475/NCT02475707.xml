	<brief_summary>This research study use special blood cell call multiple tumor-associated antigen ( TAA ) -specific T cell ( new experimental therapy ) treat patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) come back , may come back , go away standard treatment , include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . The investigator previously use sort therapy treat Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma infect Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , virus cause infectious mononucleosis ( `` mono '' `` kiss disease '' ) , Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) . EBV find cancer cell half patient Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma . This suggest may play role cause lymphoma . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape kill . The investigator previously test whether special white blood cell ( call T cell ) train kill EBV-infected cell could affect tumor , many patient investigator find give trained T cell cause complete partial response . In several lymphomas type cancer like ALL , cancer cell EBV . They however express specific protein targeted way . The investigator able infuse tumor-targeted cell 10 patient lymphoma EBV , see complete response . Importantly , treatment appear safe . Therefore , investigator want test whether investigator direct special T cell type cancer carry similar protein call tumor-associated antigen ( TAAs ) . These protein specific leukemia cell , either show , show low quantity , normal human cell . The investigator grow T cell patient ' stem cell donor laboratory way train recognize tumor protein WT1 , PRAME Survivin , express ALL cancer cell . The cell infuse least 30 day post-allogeneic stem cell transplant . In study , investigator want see whether cell able recognize kill leukemia cell express antigen . These donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cell investigational product yet approve U.S. Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find large safe dose donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cell patient ALL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration Donor MultiTAA-Specific T Cells ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To make donor-derived multiTAA-specific T cell , investigator collect blood patient 's stem cell donor , mix donor 's T cell small piece tumor protein WT1 , PRAME Survivin . These protein fragment stimulate donor T cell grow react protein way recognize kill cancer cell express protein . Once sufficient number multiTAA-specific T cell make , investigator test make sure target patient 's cancer cell , normal healthy cell . The multiTAA-specific T cell administer single intravenous ( IV ) infusion 10 minute . The patient 's cancer assess within 4 week prior T cell infusion , 4-6 week , 8-12 week infusion . If least 4 week infusion change reduction number cancer cell measure bone marrow , decline cancer-specific marker blood , patient may receive six ( 6 ) additional dos T cell every 4-6 week . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital Texas Children 's Hospital . For least 4 week infusion , patient may receive anti-cancer treatment , radiation therapy chemotherapy , exception drug like dasatinib . Patients receive therapy take treatment , able receive additional dos T cell . This dose escalation study , mean begin , patient start low dose ( 1 3 different level ) T cell . Once dose level prof safe , next group patient start next high dose . This process continue 3 dose level study . If side-effects severe , dose lower T cell injection stop . Before treated , patient undergo series standard medical test : - Physical exam . - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurement ALL ( do bone marrow biopsy blood test ) . - Pregnancy test , patient female child . Patients undergo standard medical test T cell infusion : - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurement disease 4-6 week 8-12 week T cell infusion ( do bone marrow biopsy blood test ) . Active participation study last approximately one ( 1 ) year . If patient receive additional dos T cell describe , active participation last one ( 1 ) year last dose T cell . We contact patient year 4 additional year ( total 5 year follow-up ) order evaluate disease response long-term .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only patient receive infusion integrate Cell Gene Therapy ( CAGT ) Transplant program Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) Houston Methodist Hospital ( HMH ) eligible study . 1 . Patients eligible receive donorderived multiTAAspecific T cell follow type allogeneic HSCT : ( ) Adjuvant therapy ALL ( Group A ) , ( ii ) Treatment relapsed/residual ALL disease ( Group B ) Residual disease time transplant posttransplant relapse define PCR positivity , specific cytogenetic abnormality , abnormal population flow cytometry , increased blast bone marrow biopsy peripheral blood . Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) define detection blood marrow follow : ( ) Any leukemiaspecific marker ( ( 12 ; 21 ) ; ( 9 ; 22 ) ( 4 ; 11 ) ) document patient 's leukemia cell pretransplant posttransplant evaluation . ( ii ) A leukemiaspecific phenotype ( e.g . expression marker include CD10 and/or CD19 CD3 and/or CD4 CD8 ) posttransplant level great equal 0.01 % . ( iii ) Mixed donor chimerism ( great 20 % ) . 2 . Life expectancy great equal 6 week . 3 . Karnofsky/Lansky score great equal 50 . 4 . Patient parent/guardian capable providing inform consent . 5 . Bilirubin le equal 2X upper limit normal . 6 . AST le equal 3X upper limit normal . 7 . Serum creatinine less equal 2X upper limit normal . 8 . Hgb great 8.0 g/dL ( transfuse ) . 9 . Pulse oximetry great 90 % room air . 10 . ANC great 5 x 10e8/L time infusion . 11 . Sexually active patient must willing utilize one effective birth control method 6 month ATL infusion . Male partner use condom . 12 . Available donorderived multiTAAspecific T cell line . 13 . No investigational antineoplastic therapy one month prior entry study . 1 . Patients receive ATG Campath within 28 day infusion . 2 . Patients receive Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ( DLI ) within 4 week plan T cell infusion . 3 . Less 30 day postallogeneic stem cell transplant . 4 . Severe intercurrent infection . 5 . Evidence GVHD great Grade II . 6 . Pregnant lactating . 7 . Currently take corticosteroid ( great 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) . Donor Eligibility : Donors allogeneic ( i.e . HLA match mismatch related unrelated ) stem cell transplant fulfil eligibility consent stem cell donation per stem cell transplant program 's standard operating procedure . Subjects must least 12 kg 24 pound eligible stem cell donation . The stem cell donor already select primary Bone Marrow Transplant attend accord CAGT SOPs Donor Evaluation , Donor Selection , Donor Deferral . If donor chosen transplant base urgent medical need , donor also use T cell generation , provide new reason ineligibility since stem cell collection . In study , subject 's hematopoietic stem cell donor also donor T cell .</criteria>
