	<detailed_description>Asimadoline administer 1900 human subject patient clinical trial exhibit acceptable safety profile . Due high selectivity kappa-opioid receptor , asimadoline produce mu-opioid like side-effects . Results preclinical model indicate asimadoline significantly reduce frequency scratch induced pruritic agent . This double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study design evaluate safety , tolerability clinical efficacy asimadoline patient pruritus associate atopic dermatitis .</detailed_description>
