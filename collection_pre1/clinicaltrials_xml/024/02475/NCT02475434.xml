	<brief_summary>At present , widespread use human milk-based caloric supplement ( cream ) occur , particularly infant bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , data need support adoption standard care practice . The investigator hypothesize infant receive exclusive human milk ( HM ) -based diet addition HM-derived cream caloric supplement ( Cream group ) short length initial hospital stay compare infant receive standard regimen exclusive HM-based diet ( Control group ) . The investigator hypothesize effect cream caloric supplement great subgroup infant develop BPD relationship evaluate Cream Supplement study group postmenstrual age ( PMA ) discharge incidence BPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Human Milk Cream Decrease Length Stay Extremely Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis study infant receive exclusive HM-based diet addition HM-derived cream caloric ( Cream group ) short length initial hospital stay compare infant receive standard regimen exclusive HM-based diet ( Control group ) . The study design randomize controlled trial preterm infant ( birth weight 500-1250g ) comparing use human milk cream supplement add exclusive HM-based diet ( Cream Supplement group ) exclusive HM-based diet without use cream supplement ( Control group ) . Each study group use mother 's milk , donor HM need ( donor HM obtain Human Milk Banking Association North America ( HMBANA ) Prolacta milk bank use Holder method pasteurization homogenize milk ) donor human milk-derived fortifier ( Prolact+ H2MF® ) accord study feeding protocol . Feeding do protocol fortification begin baby receive 60 mL/kg/day enteral nutrition . The randomization perform block ( block size remain blind ) without use stratification variable except study site . While blind study group always desirable randomized study , nature intervention vary method nutrition prepare deliver different unit , possible study . Sample Size : The number infant include study base primary endpoint reduction length hospital stay day 12.1 day standard deviation 31 day . With two-tailed 5 % significance level 80 % power , sample size 210 ( n=105 per group ) need demonstrate difference magnitude 2 study group . Study Duration : All study infant follow discharge transfer medical institution death ( hospital stay expect average 10 week ) . Infants transition completely exclusive HM-based diet earlier 34 week PMA , however , infant follow hospital discharge ( total estimate average 10 week ) collect anthropometric study outcome data . Study Population : Each study subject must meet indicated inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Study Procedure : After eligibility infant determine informed consent obtain parent legal guardian , infant randomize use stratify ( study site ) block scheme note either group receive human milk cream ( Cream Supplement ) ( Control ) . All study infant follow study feeding protocol . The use fortifier , time initiation advance feed per study protocol tolerate . Study infant receive exclusive HM-based diet deviate protocol ( receive formula , medium chain triglyceride ( MCT ) oil , liquid protein supplement , bovine fortifier , etc ) . Once breast milk ( either mother 's donor ) fortification initiate infant reach feed least 100 mL/kg/day , infant randomize cream group , start receive cream supplement per protocol . HM cream supplement add feed provide additional 2 kcal/oz energy ( amount cream add equal amount unfortified milk x 0.04 rounded nearest full mL ) . For example , 4 mL cream would add 96 mL unfortified milk fortifier add milk-cream mixture . The Control group receive cream feed per Table 1 . Infants follow studied discharge , transfer non-study institution , removal study death . Starting sooner 34 week PMA , infant transition 5 day either mother 's milk bovine fortifier transitional formula accord investigative site 's standard care . All infant brain MRI `` term equivalent '' age ( routine practice study site ) . Infants also body composition determine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan ( available study site ) . Anthropometric Measurements : At study site , designate study personnel ( preferably 3 consistent trained personnel ) , responsible weekly anthropometric measurement . The personnel train demonstrate proficiency obtain anthropometric measurement use proper equipment . They take weekly weight , length use study length board provide , head circumference measurement . Each measurement take twice average two record ( weekly measurement ) . Human Milk Samples : Three time week ( 3 separate day ) , sample human milk ( either mother 's donor ) per study infant obtain ( 4 mL syringe ) store future macronutrient analysis study completion . The sample store -20 degree C. The sample batch unfortified human milk represent milk use prepare 24 hour feeding . Stored sample send coordinate study center post-study analysis . Microbiome Samples : For enrolled infant , tracheal aspirate ( intubate first 24 hour life ) stool post-study evaluation infant ' airway gastrointestinal microbiome collect feasible . A recent study Lohmann et al show reduced diversity microbiome may important factor development BPD . In addition , study show human milk positively affect microbiome premature infant . Tracheal aspirate obtain per study protocol infant intubate birth 24 hour age , 48-72 hour age , 7 day age , 28 day age time extubation sooner . Any tracheal aspirate obtain within time frame acceptable ( sample convenience routine suction care ) . Stool sample obtain per study protocol 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th week life . The infant ' first stool ( meconium ) obtain . Samples collect frozen -80 degree C send coordinate study center post-study microbiome analysis .</detailed_description>

Must likely able adhere feed protocol involve mother 's milk/donor milk include fortification use HMbased product ( Prolact+H2MF® ) , potentially , human milkbased cream supplement . Enteral feeding must begin day 14 life parenteral nutrition must start day 2 life . Informed consent obtain parent legal guardian prior reach 100 ml/kg/day fortify feed .
