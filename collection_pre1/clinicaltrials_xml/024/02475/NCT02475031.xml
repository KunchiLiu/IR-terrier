	<brief_title>Single-shot TAP Block v Continuous TAP Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , prospective , double blind study compare single shot versus continuous transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block postoperative analgesia laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy . Good pain control surgery show decrease complication . To address problem postoperative pain control donor nephrectomy patient , study investigator begin perform Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) block . The TAP block involve injection local anesthetic abdominal muscle plane ( internal oblique muscle transversus abdominis muscle ) , block somatic nerve supply sensation skin , muscle , parietal peritoneum anterior abdominal wall . Prior report TAP block show provide good analgesia postoperative pain abdominal surgery . However duration postoperative pain exceeds single shot TAP block , investigator hypothesize place catheter continuous infusion local anesthetic could deliver , investigator could provide analgesia throughout postoperative period . The study investigator also hypothesize improved analgesia would decrease need opioid pain medication , hence decrease side effect associate opioid use . This study design test hypothesis place TAP catheter superior single shot TAP , provide long duration analgesia decrease narcotic use .</detailed_description>
