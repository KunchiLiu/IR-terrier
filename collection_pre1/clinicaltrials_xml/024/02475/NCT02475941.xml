	<brief_title>Early Weight Bearing Supracondylar Distal Femur Fractures Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supracondylar femur fracture represent 4-7 % femur fracture . These common orthopaedic injury overall incidence 37 per 100,000 person-years . These fracture complex challenge orthopaedic surgeon . The fracture need correctly reduce , like nearly fracture , fix enough stability permit early joint motion . This allow earlier patient rehabilitation , improve outcomes . There number different fixation device . Fixed angle implant retrograde intramedullary nail , angle blade plate , 95-degree side plate good clinical outcome resistance varus collapse . Recently , lock plate become standard method distal femoral fracture fixation . Hendersen et al . provide systematic review lock plate fixation demonstrate range complication 0 % 32 % implant failure occur late 75 % failure occur 3 month 50 % occur 6 month . Ricci et al . seek determine risk factor associate failure lock plate fixation distal femur fracture find 19 % require reoperation . The risk factor reoperation find study diabetes , smoking , increase body mass index , short plate length open fracture . Most factor surgeon control important evaluate consider prognosis . After fracture open reduce internally fix , debate postoperative management weight bearing . Weight bear follow fixation generally restrict 6 12 week radiologic evidence evidence demonstrate sufficient callous . This restrict weight bearing primarily due concern implant failure loss reduction . A study Brumback et al . examine intramedullary nail fixation distal femur fracture conclude allow full weight bearing comminute femoral shaft fracture antegrade intramedullary nail . This study lead surgeon accelerate rehabilitation protocol . The post-operative weight bearing recommendation distal femur fracture treat lock plate vary widely motivate Granata et al . evaluate biomechanics immediate weight bear distal femur fracture treat locked plate fixation . They find fatigue limit lock plate construct 1.9 time body weight average 70-kilogram patient simulate 10-week postoperative course . Although study could fully support immediate weight bear due fact femoral load gait estimate around 2 time body weight , demonstrated adequate hardware fixation weight bearing . The benefit early weight bear accelerate functional recovery , increase independence , decrease impact family , increase psychological benefit , reduce use healthcare resource , decrease need family intervention , family take care patient . The downside strength fixation , risk implant failure , risk loss reduction . The goal evaluate fracture , complication rate , mortality rate , risk healthcare resource use .</detailed_description>
