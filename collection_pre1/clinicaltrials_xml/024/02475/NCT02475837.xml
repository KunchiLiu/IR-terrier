	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To determine vorapaxar safely improve arteriovenous ( AV ) fistula functional maturation administer maturation process compare placebo . 2 . To determine vorapaxar safely improve AV fistula patency , allow secondary procedure aid fistula maturation compare placebo . 3 . To determine vorapaxar safely facilitate successful cannulation AV fistula hemodialysis compare placebo . Hypotheses : 1 . Vorapaxar initiate day follow AV fistula creation result improve fistula functional maturation without increase risk bleed major adverse event . 2 . Vorapaxar initiate day follow AV fistula creation result improve fistula patency increase utility secondary procedure aid fistula maturation , without increase risk bleed major adverse event . 3 . Vorapaxar initiate day follow AV fistula creation facilitate successful cannulation AV fistula hemodialysis without increase risk bleed major adverse event . Background : End-stage renal disease affect nearly 500,000 person US 2 million person worldwide . In US develop country , hemodialysis predominant dialytic modality . While effective sustain life patient , hemodialysis rarely restore health . Roughly one five patient dialysis die year ; patient survive experience poor functional status , impaired physical cognitive function severely impaired health-related quality life . Moreover , cost ESRD program exceed $ 40B US annually . Hemodialysis vascular access often refer 'Achilles Heel '' dialysis care . The Brescia-Cimino ( radiocephalic end-to-side ) fistula consider gold standard vascular access ; upper arm arteriovenous fistula often create instead . Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft next best , frequently complicate graft `` thrombosis , '' commonly cause hematologic abnormality , rather intimal hyperplasia venous anastomosis . Unfortunately , majority patient insufficient time undergo pre-emptive creation arteriovenous fistula graft , patient start hemodialysis either temporary `` semi-permanent '' tunnel catheter , often place one internal jugular vein . For patient undergo fistula creation , either advance ( optimally ) start hemodialysis , sizeable fraction arteriovenous fistula never mature sufficiently usable hemodialysis . It common patient undergo three attempt fistula creation , extend time experience heighten risk infection venous stenosis/thrombosis internal jugular vein case complication include superior vena cava syndrome . Therapeutic agent could facilitate maturation arteriovenous fistula could vastly improve health well-being patient hemodialysis , could well result enhanced survival . Preliminary Data Numerous small study attempt improve short- longer-term function arteriovenous fistulae graft variety therapeutic agent , include warfarin , aspirin , fish oil , dipyridamole several new antiplatelet agent , include ticlopidine recently clopidogrel . In order address press need improve outcome , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) National Institutes Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) assemble `` Dialysis Access Consortium '' 10 year ago - consortium highly qualified investigator whose aim design two major clinical trial address failure arteriovenous fistula graft , respectively . Dr. Chertow serve Data Safety Monitoring Board DAC trial . The DAC investigator conduct randomized , placebo-controlled trial clopidogrel patient receive arteriovenous fistula ( another trial examine arteriovenous graft discuss ) . Interestingly , clopidogrel show enhance short-term patency arteriovenous fistula , fail result improved maturation , sufficient fistula consistently use maintenance hemodialysis . Roughly six 10 patient assign trial ( outstanding clinical center ) fail usable fistula 3-4 month , highlight need effective therapy . Despite DAC fistula study stop prematurely `` efficacy '' ( primary outcome early fistula patency ) , patient receive clopidogrel purpose clinical practice . Vorapaxar , Cardiovascular Disease ESRD PAR-1 receptor express platelet , endothelial cell atheromatous plaque suggest important role tissue response injury , inflammation thrombosis . Vorapaxar may role prevent vascular access complication . Vorapaxar study two large cardiovascular outcome trial - TRA-2P TRACER . In trial , vorapaxar reduce composite CV death , MI stroke excess bleeding . Patients renal dysfunction exclude . Vorapaxar approve FDA secondary prevention patient stable cardiovascular disease . Recent analysis TRACER show non-heterogeneity treatment effect safety efficacy outcomes patient without renal dysfunction ( Mahaffey KW , ESC abstract presentation ) Additionally , Kosoglou et al . show relatively small study pharmacokinetics vorapaxar alter ESRD , suggest dosing could proceed without modification population . This randomized placebo-controlled double-blind pilot trial . Study procedure conduct Stanford University Medical Center , standard-of-care ( SOC ) procedure conduct Stanford 's affiliated hospital ( Veteran 's Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System Stanford Vascular Surgery Clinic Valley Medical Center ) .
