	<brief_title>Circulatory Levels Irisin Response Chronic Resistance Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study study circulate level irisin response chronic high-intensity resistance train group healthy young adult . Sample : The sample comprise 44 adult men woman unpaid volunteer age 18 30 . Pre-screening assessment : Informed consent , PAR-Q , Medical History Exercise History use determine health status prior exercise experience . Menstrual cycle log require female participant . Pre-Intervention assessment : - Anthropometric measurement Body Composition : Height , triceps , thigh calf skinfolds , biceps , thigh , hip , waist , calf circumference measure . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) perform obtain body composition . - Cardiopulmonary Strength Fitness Testing . Cardiopulmonary fitness determine via maximum oxygen uptake testing . One maximum repetition ( 1-RM ) use assess muscular fitness . - Spontaneous Physical Activity : Daily activity level 7 day collect . - Familiarization . Participant instruct muscle conditioning technique use strength train technique master . The rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) scale also use familiarization session . Intervention : The intervention last 3 week frequency 3 training session per week . We collect blood sample level session 1 ( begin week 1 ) , session 3 ( end week 1 ) , session 6 ( end week 2 ) session 9 ( end week 3 ) . Blood draws occur begin session evaluate ( pre-session ) , 45 min mark session immediately session ( post-session ) . The session consist circuit training 3 set 7 exercise focus major muscle group . Ten repetition circuit 70 % maximum capacity perform . During intervention : - Blood-related variable . Baseline glucose , lactate hematocrit obtain participant prior intervention . Lactate Hematocrit obtain pre-intervention post-intervention , within 1 min post workout session 1 , 3 , 6 9 . Irisin obtain blood sample baseline , train session 1 , 3 , 6 9 . Irisin measure via commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . - Dietary Controls . Each participant complete Food Preference Questionnaire . In addition , Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall ( ASA24 ) collect day prior session 1 , 3 , 6 9 . Post-Intervention assessment : - Anthropometric measurement Body Composition : Height , triceps , thigh calf skinfolds , biceps , thigh , hip , waist , calf circumference measure . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) perform obtain body composition . - Caridorespiratory capacity determine via maximum oxygen uptake testing . One maximum repetition ( 1-RM ) use assess muscular fitness . - Spontaneous Physical Activity : Daily activity level 7 day collect .</detailed_description>
