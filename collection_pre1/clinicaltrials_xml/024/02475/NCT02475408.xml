	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease benefit bypass : Despite considerable advance medicine , cardiovascular disease remain number one cause death globally , primarily consequence myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Although widely use stable CAD , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) show reduce incidence myocardial infarction death . In contrast , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) significantly reduce rate death myocardial infarction compare PCI . Similarly , coronary collateral exert protective effect provide alternative source blood flow myocardial territory potentially affect acute coronary occlusion . Coronary collateral represent pre-existing inter-arterial anastomosis natural counter-part surgically create bypass . Sufficient coronary collateral show confer significant benefit term overall mortality cardiovascular event . In regard , concept augment coronary collateral function alternative treatment strategy alter course CAD , well control symptom , attractive . Durable promotion coronary collateral circulation : While multitude intervention show effective collateral growth promotion , far , effect current intervention temporary therefore recurrent application necessary sustain level collateral . However , advent coronary artery bypass grafting , permanent augmentation coronary collateral supply single structural modification already attempt . Bilateral ligation internal mammary artery ( IMA ) perform CAD patient alleviate angina pectoris electrocardiographic ( ECG ) sign ischemia . The prevalent vivo function natural IMA-to-coronary artery bypass anti-ischemic effect - first time - recently demonstrate research group . Levels collateral function myocardial ischemia determine two coronary balloon occlusion , first , second without distal IMA balloon occlusion . Coronary collateral function , consistently increase presence v absence distal ipsilateral IMA balloon occlusion . These finding corroborate observed reduction ischemia . Conversely , distal contralateral IMA occlusion , collateral function ECG sign ischemia remain unchanged . The acute functional change observe response temporary distal IMA balloon occlusion expect result large chronic structural adaptation IMA-to-coronary-artery connection distal IMA permanently occlude . In contrast previously employ arteriogenic approach human , attractiveness intervention lie potential durability effect . In first step , catheter-based IMA occlusion ought conceptually investigate set less frequently graft right IMA among patient ischemia right coronary artery territory .</detailed_description>
