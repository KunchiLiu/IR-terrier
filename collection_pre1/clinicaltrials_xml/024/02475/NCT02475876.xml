	<brief_summary>Developmental change physiology childhood influence drug dosing . Failure account change lead improper dosing , associate decreased drug efficacy safety child . Population physiologically-based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model offer opportunity predict optimal drug dose base physiologic parameter adjust developmental change . PBPK model mathematical construct incorporate physiologic process drug characteristic genetic variance characterize dose-exposure relationship across age continuum . These model integrate drug-specific ( e.g. , metabolism , protein bind ) systems-specific ( e.g. , organ size , blood flow ) information predict effect different factor ( e.g. , age , genetic variant , disease ) drug exposure . By account factor use data clinical trial confirm model , PBPK model reduce number child need clinical trial maximize dose-based efficacy safety . This trial evaluate platform prospectively validate population PBPK model child . The study drug , clindamycin Bactrim ( aka TMP-SMX ) , ideal candidate evaluate population PBPK model child due differ physico-chemical property elimination pathway . In addition , trial clindamycin TMP-SMX broad clinical applicability , drug among commonly use agent treat gram-positive infection infant child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This PK safety study infant child require prophylaxis , treatment confirm suspected infection clindamycin TMP-SMX . Each subject involve study 33 day ( 3 day therapy , 30 day serious adverse event monitoring ) . STUDY PROCEDURES Baseline/pre-dose assessment - After parent legally authorize representative sign IRB-approved informed consent form determine subject satisfies inclusion exclusion criterion , follow evaluation record CRF : 1 . Subject demographic include sex , date birth , race , ethnicity 2 . For infant â‰¤12 month age : gestational age ( GA ) body weight birth 3 . Active medical history ( admission note medical record ) 4 . Concomitant medication 5 . For subject receive study drug per standard care , record last 6 dos clindamycin TMP-SMX receive prior study drug administration ( date , time , route administration ) 6 . Targeted physical examination , include weight length/height 7 . Laboratory determination within 48 hour prior enrollment perform per local standard care . If serum creatinine collect standard care , collect study confirm eligibility . 8 . Microbiology determination within 48 hour prior enrollment perform per local standard care . Treatment assessments/procedures ( Day 1-3 ) - The following assessment conduct day subject study : 1 . Date , time , route , site administration , dose , formulation study drug dose 2 . Concomitant medication 3 . PK sample ( blood urine ) date , time , site collection 4 . Genetic sampling ( ) 5 . Laboratory determination perform per standard care 6 . Microbiologic determination perform per standard care 7 . Serum sample determination alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration subject enrol clindamycin arm . Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration measure one plasma PK sample . A separate blood sample require . 8 . Study drug-related adverse event AEs SAEs If available , record laboratory determination daily ; several laboratory determination available day , record test result closest administration study drug . PK SAMPLING Plasma pharmacokinetics sample scheme . Clindamycin : Sample collection window relative start infusion IV clindamycin , except first post-infusion sample , relative end infusion . Three plasma PK sample collect around first dose accord follow sampling window : - 0-10 minute end first dose - 2-4 hour start first dose - &lt; 30 minute prior second dose Four plasma PK sample collect time dose 6 accord follow sampling window . - Pre-dose - 0-10 minute - 2-4 hour - &lt; 30 minute prior next schedule dose While treatment IV clindamycin necessary inclusion clindamycin arm study , subject may transition IV oral clindamycin eligible PK sample collection oral phase . TMP-SMX : Sample collection window relative administration oral TMP-SMX . Three plasma PK sample collect around first dose accord follow sampling window : - 1-3 hour end first dose - 6-8 hour start first dose - &lt; 30 minute prior second dose Four plasma PK sample collect time dose 6 accord follow sampling window . - Pre-dose - 1-3 hour - 6-8 hour - &lt; 30 minute prior next schedule dose Urine PK sample - Urine PK sample require subject complete study . If possible , every effort make collect urine PK sample accord follow schedule . Clindamycin IV : One urine sample collect timed aliquot urine excrete one follow interval dose 6 : - 0-2 hour - 2-4 hour - 4-8 hour TMP-SMX : One urine sample collect timed aliquot urine excrete one follow interval dose 6 : - 0-3 hour - 3-6 hour - 6-9 hour - 9-12 hour Opportunistic PK sample - Opportunistic sample bone , skin , synovial fluid also collect obtain per standard care . Sampling genotyping - All blood pellet leave centrifugation plasma PK sample collect combined one whole blood pellet sample per subject . This combined whole blood pellet send genetic analysis single nucleotide polymorphisms CYP3A family CYP2C9 gene . STATISTICS All subject receive least 1 dose study drug include intention-to-treat ( ITT ) population use safety analysis . All subject provide least 1 evaluable PK sample include PK analysis . Descriptive statistic number observation , mean , median , standard deviation , standard error , minimum , maximum present continuous variable ( age , weight , etc. ) . Other descriptive statistic count , proportion , and/or percentage present summarize discrete variable ( race , sex , etc. ) . All descriptive analysis present appropriate treatment group ( ITT per-protocol ) overall . A detailed description statistical method secondary analysis prepare presented statistical analysis plan prior data lock final analysis .</detailed_description>
