	<brief_title>Efficacy VHM After Treatment Interruption Subjects Initiating ART During Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study site : This single-center proof-of-concept study recruitment follow-up volunteer do Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre ( TRC-ARC ) . Subject Population : Subjects age 18-60 year old , initiated ART acute HIV infection maintain viral suppression ( HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) least 28 week prior ask enroll study . The subject must CD4 ≥ 450 cells/µl , EKG laboratory value within acceptable range . Sample Size : Fifteen subject enrol randomized 2:1 VHM + ART ( N=10 ) versus ART ( N=5 ) . Study Design An exploratory , open label , randomize study vorinostat/hydroxychloroquine/maraviroc ( VHM ) + ART versus ART . Study Drug Vorinostat administer 400mg orally every 24h 3 cycle , 14 day interim rest-period 14 day cycle period 10 week . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) administer dose 200mg 2X/daily course vorinostat administration 10 week . Maraviroc administer 600 mg 2X/daily schedule HCQ . This dose maraviroc base concomitant use efavirenz . Dosing adjusted appropriate subject integrase inhibitor protease inhibitor instead efavirenz due intolerance drug primary non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) resistance . Any standard ART regimen may use . However , expect majority subject 2 nucleos ( ) ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) [ emtricitabine ( FTC ) tenofovir ( TDF ) 1 NNRTI [ efavirenz ( EFV ) ] . ART administer follow dos : FTC , 200mg 1X/day 3TC , 300mg 1X/day ; TDF , 300mg 1X/day EFV , 600mg 1X/day . In subject NNRTI-based therapy , NNRTI interrupt week 8 rest regimen interrupt week 10 . In order prevent NNRTI resistance , protease inhibitor replacement therapy darunavir ( 900 mg 1X/day ritonavir 100 mg 1X/day ) give week 8 10 maraviroc reduce 1200mg/day 300mg/day . Study Duration Protocol : A minimum 34 week treatment initiation . Subjects must ART minimum 42 week prior study entry . Note subject may enrol RV254/SEARCH010 already fulfil minimum 42-week ART requirement . The VHM treatment occur 10 week follow-up period 24 week . Study Design Methodology : The study design two-arm , open label randomize study . Subjects recruit RV254/SEARCH 010 . RV254/SEARCH 010 acute HIV infection cohort conduct Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre Bangkok , Thailand . Subjects follow twice daily first 24h follow first treatment administration week 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 10 weekly thereafter week 22 , every 2 week thereafter week 34 . Phlebotomy perform clinical hematology , CD4 , HIV RNA , ALT , creatinine lipid VHM arm also receive EKG eye examination screen and/or enrollment . Subjects monitor weekly follow treatment interruption follow 12 week viral load every two week week 34 ensure viral rebound , define 2 consecutive viral load measurement &gt; 1000 copies/ml . ART re-initiated CD4 count measure event viral rebound . A small proviral reservoir less diverse viral population occur early HIV infection relative chronic infection . Preliminary data RV254/SEARCH 010 study indicate T cell immunity well preserve subject treat ART early HIV infection relative chronic HIV infection . The investigator hypothesize subject treat ART early HIV infection treat multiple cycle histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) , vorinostat , combination hydroxychloroquine maraviroc lead activation latent reservoir reduce virus infection new target . Furthermore , subject treat ART early HIV infection , T cell response capable eliminate virus activate HDACi result reduction viral reservoir . Primary Objective : To compare proportion patient VHM co-administered withART versus ART arm able maintain HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml follow treatment interruption . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Time HIV RNA rebound treatment interruption VHM +ART versus ART arm 2 . To compare cell-associated HIV RNA ( multi-spliced unspliced ) total CD4+ T cell VHM +ART versus ART arm 3 . To compare marker HIV persistence ( total integrate HIV DNA 2-LTR circle ) VHM + ART versus ART arm 4 . To compare histone acetylation ( H3 ) VHM +ART versus ART arm 5 . To compare adverse event relate unrelated combination vorinostat , hydroxychloroquine maraviroc arm 6 . To compare occurrence severity acute retroviral syndrome arm follow treatment interruption Hypotheses : Compared ART arm , VHM +ART arm : 1 . A high proportion patient HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml follow treatment interruption end study 2 . Longer time HIV RNA rebound follow treatment interruption 3 . Higher cell-associated RNA total CD4+ T cell end VHM treatment period 4 . Lower reservoir size 2 LTR circle end VHM treatment period end study 5 . Higher histone acetylation end VHM treatment 6 . Higher adverse event relate VHM 7 . Similar rate acute retroviral syndrome treatment interruption subject experience viral rebound</detailed_description>
