	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , single ascend dose study healthy participant JNJ-54175446 . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase ( 21 2 day prior dose administration ) , double-blind treatment phase ( 8 day ; Part 1 Part 3 ) open-label treatment phase ( 8 day ; Part 2 ) , follow-up examination ( within 14 21 day dose administration ) . The maximal study duration participant exceed 6 week . In cohort Part 1 ( 6 cohort ) Part 3 ( 1 cohort ) , participant randomly assign receive JNJ-54175446 matching placebo cohort part 2 , participant assign JNJ-54175446 treatment . In part 1 , primarily maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) assess , along safety tolerability JNJ-54175446 . In part 2 , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) JNJ-54175446 cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) assess . In part 3 , effect food plasma PK JNJ-54175446 young healthy male participant assess . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
