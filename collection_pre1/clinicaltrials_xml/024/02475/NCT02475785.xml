	<brief_title>Evaluation Mini Plates Anchorage With Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Class II malocclusion characterize incorrect relationship maxillary mandibular arch due skeletal dental problem combination . The prevalence malocclusion recently find 20.6 % Egyptian population age 11 14 year mandibular retrusion common characteristic . It also mention population show predominance mandibular retrusion ( 80 % ) oppose 20 % express excessive maxillary development . Class II profile attractiveness previously investigate literature . It find patient , peer , orthodontists oral surgeon , rat subject Class I profile attractive others Class II profile . It also report profile normal adolescent patient favorably perceive layperson untreated Class II division 1 malocclusion subject . In grow patient Class II mandibular retrusion , functional orthopedic appliance commonly use mandibular advancement base concept growth modification . However , two main problem appear compromise desire treatment outcome appliance ; need patient cooperation lack possibility combine use fix appliance therapy order shorten treatment duration . Many systematic review meta-analyses recently perform literature answer question whether removable functional appliance ( RFAs ) produce skeletal effect correction skeletal discrepancy induce actual increase mandibular dimension . Most recently two systematic review conclude skeletal effect RFAs minimal could consider negligible clinical importance . They mention treatment Class II malocclusion RFAs associate minimal stimulation mandibular growth , minimal restriction maxillary growth significant dento-alveolar soft tissue change . Fixed functional appliance first introduce Emil Herbst 1905 . Many type fix functional appliance develop since ; include Jasper jumper Twin force Bite corrector . The Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device ( FFRD ) introduce Bill Vogt 2006 . It represent semi-rigid fixed functional alternative intend overcome breakage problem flexible fix functional appliance . However , proven dental change significant skeletal change final occlusal result . These change include mesial movement mandibular molar proclination mandibular incisor . These unwanted tooth movement appear compromise actual skeletal correction jeopardize stability result . Several attempt propose counteract unwanted dento-alveolar side effect fix functional appliance . Use lingual arch , increase dimension archwires , introduction negative torque archwires use low incisor bracket lingual crown torque example . Some study use mini implant attempt limit unwanted dental effect fix functional appliance . These study prove mini implant anchorage reduce low incisor proclination turn increase upper incisor retroclination able achieve significant skeletal mandibular effect . Titanium mini plate introduce use orthodontic anchorage 1999 skeletal anchorage system open bite correction . They proven well accepted patient provider , safe effective adjunct complex orthodontic case . Other us mini plate orthodontics include maxillary mandibular molar distalization orthodontic anchorage report able provide absolute anchorage . Bone anchor maxillary protraction use mini plate report successful produce significant forward maxillary growth Class III grow subject . Recently mini plate use direct load FFRD correction skeletal Class II malocclusion . They report actual skeletal change increase mandibular length minimal dento-alveolar side effect . However , result preliminary take caution study include control group . 2 . Research Hypothesis : The null hypothesis ( H0 ) research use direct mini plate anchorage conjunction FFRD able induce skeletal rather dental effect correction skeletal Class II malocclusion comparison conventional FFRD therapy untreated grow Class II control subject . 3 . Objectives : The primary objective study determine mini plate use conjunction FFRD induce supplemental growth mandible Class II malocclusion subject mandibular retrognathism . Secondary objective include To determine mini plate use conjunction FFRD able : - Reduce dento-alveolar side effect produce fixed functional appliance treatment skeletal Class II subject - Correct soft tissue convexity Class II subject - Correct molar canine relationship - Develop patient ' well-accepted treatment modality correction skeletal Class II malocclusion . 4 . Study design According norm CONSORT STATEMENT , study clinical intervention , allocation subject randomize ( block randomization ) . This study parallel blind outcome assessor . The primary purpose study treatment . 5 . Participants - Settings location data collect The treatment perform outpatient clinic Department Orthodontics Cairo State University . This public university predominantly serve low-income population living Cairo , Egypt . Data collect April 2015 August 2016 . 6 . Interventions Two group receive treatment . Group 1 treat FFRD mini plat anchorage 10 month correction malocclusion . Group 2 treat conventional FFRD 10 month correction malocclusion . A third untreated control group include observation period 6-8 month . 7a . Sample size Our sample size calculation base study compare use Herbst appliance without mini implant anchorage report significant increase Herbst mini screw group control group . The mean change mandibular length treatment control group 4.6±2.43 mm 0.9±2.09 mm respectively . Thus mean difference 3.7 within group standard deviation set 2.26 . Because three group compare , Bonferroni adjustment use alpha level/number comparison = 0.05/3= 0.0167 adjust multiple comparison . Power Sample size calculation ( PS ) software ( department biostatistics Vanderbilt University ) use sample size calculation . A test perform power set 0.9 , allocation ratio 1:1:1 Type I error probability ( alpha ) associate test set 0.0167 . Results test show `` The Group sample size 11 , 11 11 achieve 90 % power reject null hypothesis equal mean significance level ( alpha ) 0.0167 '' Therefore , 33 subject need , 12 subject group . To account patient loss follow ( attrition ) , sample size 45 patient select divide three group , fifteen . 7b . Interim analysis stop guideline In group mini plat anchorage , case mobility mini-plates subject , load remove two week . After , load restore . If mobility persists , surgical exposure mini plate do either insertion longer mini screw ion mini plate change position mini plate do . Any harm , adverse effect unintended effect study intervention document report . Post-surgical swell pain anticipate addressed antibiotic pain killer . Other unanticipated surgical harm immediately manage report . Harms related orthodontic appliance manage principal investigator . 8 . Randomization 8a . Sequence generation The randomization recruit subject do randomized list , use random.org website . This list make individual involved clinical trial ( S.B . ) 8b . Type The type randomization block randomization . The number block block size blinded investigator . 9 . Allocation concealment mechanism - Each patient allocate number sequentially numbered opaque seal envelope fulfillment inclusion criterion sign informed consent enrol study . - According number , patient allocate one group use randomization table . 10 . Implementation Before begin research , allocation sequence generate person involve study ( Dr S.B. ) . The random list seal principal investigator enroll participant . After participant take sealed number , S.B . contact implement allocation . All study contributor access random list . The envelope close type treatment select storage information . 11 . Blinding Blinding carry data assessment researcher , participant subject blind . Therefore , person know nature trial analyze data .</detailed_description>
