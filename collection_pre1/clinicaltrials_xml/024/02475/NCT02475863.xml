	<brief_title>Model-based Versus Traditional Warfarin Dosing Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Warfarin widely use child heart surgery order prevent complication may arise due blood clot form unwanted place - example brain cause stroke .

Traditionally , approach dose warfarin child select start dose accord standard guideline adjust dos child monitor INR ( measure quickly blood clot ) . However , person 's make well external factor , age , weight , diet genetics affect warfarin dosing make control dose hence control INR , difficult . Recently however , sophisticated dose model develop researcher take account factor . The model design help doctor select best dose warfarin child individualise prescription . The aim propose research , therefore , compare model base warfarin dose traditional approach warfarin dose child undergone congenital heart surgery .
