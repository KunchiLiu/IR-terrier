	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety enoblituzumab ( MGA271 ) combination Keytruda ( pembrolizumab ) give patient B7-H3-expressing melanoma , squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , B7-H3 express cancer . The study also evaluate high dose enoblituzumab give safely give pembrolizumab . Assessments also do see drug act body ( pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ) evaluate potential anti-tumor activity MGA271 combination pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Enoblituzumab ( MGA271 ) Combination With Pembrolizumab Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 1 open-label , dose escalation , cohort expansion , efficacy follow-up study enoblituzumab administer intravenously ( IV ) weekly schedule 51 dos combination IV pembrolizumab administer every-3-week schedule 17 dos . The dose escalation phase design characterize safety tolerability combination enoblituzumab pembrolizumab define maximum tolerate maximum administer dose ( MTD/MAD ) . Patients methothelioma , urethelial cancer , NSCLC , SCCHN , clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) , ovarian cancer , melanoma , thyroid cancer , triple negative breast cancer ( TBNC ) , pancreatic cancer , colon cancer , soft tissue sarcoma , prostate cancer enrol study phase . In cohort expansion phase , 3 cohort 16 patient enrolled evaluate safety potential efficacy combination administer MTD/MAD dose patient melanoma , NSCLC , SCCHN . Pre- on-study biopsy require melanoma patient cohort expansion phase . The efficacy follow-up period consist 2-year period final dose study drug . All tumor evaluation carry Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) .</detailed_description>
