	<brief_summary>According recent report use EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) , survival EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC tendency extension . However , real situation reason clarified.This observational study collect data EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC approximately 2,000 medical record approximately 20 facility Japan observe treatment reality EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Site ( ) , number subject country plan Approximately 2000 , Advanced Non Small Cell Lung cancer ( aNSCLC ) patient fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit 10 20 investigational site Japan . Total plan Study period Estimated date first subject June , 2015 Estimated date last subject November , 2015 Estimated date data base lock December , 2015 Estimated date first subject investigation survival January , 2016 Estimated date last subject investigation survival March , 2016 Estimated date data base lock investigation survival March , 2016 Medicinal Products ( type , dose , mode administration ) concomitant medication Not applicable Study Rationale As benefit EGFR mutation-positive patient report , EGFR-TKI recommend guideline standard first-line therapy EGFR mutation-positive patient . Back concomitant use platinum medication 3rd-generation cytocidal drug standard therapy , treatment poor prognosis , 8 10 month term median overall survival , 1-year survival rate 30 % 35 % . Then , gefitinib approve July 2002 . Takano et al . report survival among patient EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer get long approval gefitinib . The overall survival patient EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer 27.7 month gefitinib group Study North East Japan ( NEJ ) 002 report Inoue et al . 2013 , 34.8 month gefitinib group Study West Japan Oncology Group ( WJOG ) 3405 report Yoshioka et al . 2014 , 36.3 month patient receive erlotinib Study Japan Oncology ( JO ) 22903 report Katakami et al . 2014 , 46.9 month afatinib group 35.8 month chemotherapy group Japanese subset Study Lux-Lung3 report Kato . According recent report , overall survival tend prolong , actual situation reason tendency reveal . Thus , plan present study , clarify prognosis , patient characteristic treatment regimen patient EGFR mutation positive NSCLC provide useful information order promote individualized therapy patient EGFR mutation positive NSCLC . Study Objectives The primary objective study intend reveal characteristic reality treatment survival among patient EGFR mutation-positive advanced/recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . The primary objective , secondary objective exploratory objective study follow . Primary objective study : - To estimate overall survival patient Secondary objective study : - To estimate overall survival patient background - To estimate overall survival treatment sequence - To calculate treatment time exposure rate treatment category ( Sum treatment time patient treatment category/Sum treatment time patient ) - To estimate efficacy Gefitinib treatment Exploratory objectives study : - To explore factor impact prognosis among patient - To explore relationship treatment sequence prognosis among patient Study Design This domestic , multicenter , retrospective non-interventional diagnostic study . The data subject EGFR mutation-positive advanced/recurrent NSCLC collect least 2000 case 10 20 site . Target subject population The patient EGFR mutation-positive advanced/recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Survey item 1 .
