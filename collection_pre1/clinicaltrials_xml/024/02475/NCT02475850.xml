	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine effectiveness evidence-based , patient-centered multifactorial fall injury prevention strategy implement within primary care practice use usual health care resource Design : This study cluster randomize , parallel group superiority trial practice stratify healthcare system patient nest within practice . The unit randomization practice . Study Duration : The total study duration 4 year . Recruitment take place 20 month , follow-up take place 18 month - 40 month depend date enrollment . Trial Sites : 86 primary care practice part 10 trial site locate around U.S. : The Partners ' Health Care System ; Essentia ; Hopkins Health Care System ; HealthCare Partners ; Reliant Health Care System ; Mount Sinai Health Care System ; University Pittsburgh Health Care System ; University Texas Medical Branch Health Care System ; University Iowa Health Care System ; University Michigan Health Care System .

Intervention : An evidence-based patient-centered intervention combine element multifactorial , risk factor-based , standardly-tailored fall prevention strategy develop Yale , practice guideline offer Center Disease Control 's ( CDC 's ) `` STEADI '' toolbox ( Stopping Elderly Accidents , Disability Injury ) joint American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society guideline , Assessing Care Vulnerable Elders ( ACOVE ) practice change approach . The fall prevention strategy systematically implement clinical practice use : delivery system design improve quality ( Co-management ) ; decision support ( algorithm ) ; information system ( software ) ; self-management support ( patient/caregiver engagement activation ) ; linkage community-based resource . Primary Outcome : The primary outcome serious fall-related injury , operationalized lead medical attention , include non-vertebral fracture , joint dislocation , head injury , laceration , major sequela ( e.g . rhabdomyolysis , internal injury ) . Primary Analysis : The risk serious fall injury ( i.e. , time first event ) analyze use survival model incorporate compete risk ( due death ) clustering . In analysis , participant lose follow-up without prior serious fall-related injury censor date last see . In secondary analysis , investigator adjust pre-specified set baseline covariates examine influence intervention effect . Secondary Outcomes : Number fall , number fall-related injury , measure well-being .</detailed_description>
