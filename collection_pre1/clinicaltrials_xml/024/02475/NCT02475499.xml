	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether incretin-based drug ( use treat type 2 diabetes ) take either alone combination anti-diabetic drug associate increase risk pancreatic cancer ( PC ) compare sulfonylurea . The investigator carry separate population base cohort study use administrative health database five jurisdiction Canada , US , UK . Cohorts define initiation new anti-diabetic drug incretin-based drug enter market , follow-up hospitalization PC . The result separate site combine provide overall assessment risk PC user incretin-based drug class incretin-based drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study objective determine whether use incretin-based drug , compare use sulfonylurea , associate increase risk pancreatic cancer ( PC ) routine clinical practice . The investigator use common-protocol approach conduct retrospective cohort study use administrative health care data five jurisdiction ( Canadian province Alberta , Manitoba , Ontario , well United States ( US ) MarketScan , United Kingdom ( UK ) Clinical Practice Research Datalink [ CPRD ] ) . Briefly , Canadian database include population-level data physician billing , diagnose procedure hospital discharge abstract , dispensation prescription drug . Ontario data restrict patient age 65 year old prescription data available young patient . The CPRD clinical database representative UK population contains record patient see 680 general practitioner practice UK ; data link Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) database , contain in-hospital diagnosis procedure data . US MarketScan include individual dependent cover large U.S. employer health insurance plan , government public organization . Study population In jurisdiction , investigator assemble base cohort include patient first-ever prescription non-insulin anti-diabetic drug , include biguanides , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones , DPP-4 inhibitor , GLP-1 analog , alpha-glucosidase inhibitor , meglitinides , combination drug earliest availability data site last date availability data . The date prescription ( CPRD ) dispensation ( site ) first-ever non-insulin anti-diabetic drug define date base cohort entry . From base cohort , study cohort create include patient initiated new anti-diabetic drug class year incretin-based drug enter market jurisdiction time thereafter . These new user consist newly-treated diabetes , well switch add new anti-diabetic drug class include part previous treatment history . The date study cohort entry define prescription date newly-prescribed drug class . Patients study cohort follow date study cohort entry + 365 day event ( define ) censor due death , departure database , loss continuous health plan drug plan enrolment , entry long-term care facility , end study period ( June 30 , 2014 last date data availability site ) , whichever occur first . Case-control selection The cohort define analyzed use nested case-control analysis , case define hospitalization PC . Risk set sample use randomly select 20 control case , match sex , age ( ± 365 day ) , date study cohort entry ( ± 180 day ) , duration treat diabetes ( ± 90 day ) , duration follow-up day . Exposure assessment Ever-use anti-diabetic drug define prescription anti-diabetic agent base cohort entry index day -365 day . This 365-day lag period apply account disease latency potential protopathic bias consider prescription receive ( include ) Base Cohort Entry Date ( include ) date one year prior Index day . Ever-use exposure classify hierarchically base follow three mutually-exclusive category : 1 ) incretin-based drug ; 2 ) sulfonylurea ; 3 ) antidiabetic agent . Sulfonylureas serve primary reference category incretin-based drug second- third-line therapy thus use comparable point disease management . Statistical analysis Conditional logistic regression use estimate odds ratio ( ORs ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) association hospitalization PC , compare ever-use incretin-based drug ever-use sulfonylurea . This consider primary analysis . Secondary analysis include sub-classifying ever-users incretin-based drug type ( i.e. , DPP-4 inhibitor v GLP-1 analog ) , cumulative duration ever-use ( ≤ 365 day , 366-729 day , ≥730 day ) , time since initiation treatment among ever-users . In addition , four sensitivity analysis conduct , define priori , assess robustness result . Finally , site-specific estimate meta-analyzed use random-effects model inverse variance weighting , fixed-effects analysis conduct sensitivity analysis . The amount between-site heterogeneity estimate use I square statistic .</detailed_description>
