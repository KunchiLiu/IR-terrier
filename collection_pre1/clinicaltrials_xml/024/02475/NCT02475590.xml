	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No consensus propose Medical Surgical society define / prioritize surgical procedure obesity surgery . Indications base patient 's age , sex , dietary habit , importance overweight associate comorbidities even rarely admit , base knowledge surgical team cost intervention . Given decrease gastric banding procedure , Roux-en-Y gastro-jejunal bypass often consider reference procedure . The gastric bypass , develop 60 , perform laparoscopically since early 90 . It allow 60 % 70 % excess weight loss control 75 % comorbidities . It recommend follow patient long-term late complication occur . These patient require ongoing information regular monitoring . They must also hyper-protein diet vitamin substitute long-term ( multivitamin , vitamin B12 , calcium ... ) . The Sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) arise alternative RYGB . It classically propose patient BMI great 60 significant comorbidities since procedure let significant weight reduction patient procedure difficult perform . The quality weight loss achieve patient lead many team analyze result intervention without conduct additional procedure . It appear literature even perform alone , SG present many benefit . To clarify role sleeve gastrectomy bariatric procedure range , investigator propose conduct prospective randomize study compare laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy Roux-en-Y gastric bypass .</detailed_description>
