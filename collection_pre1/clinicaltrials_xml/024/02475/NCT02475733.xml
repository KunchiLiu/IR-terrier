	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Pharmacokinetics Efficacy CAZ-AVI With Metronidazole Childern Aged 3 Months 18 Years Old With Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections ( cIAIs ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentre , multinational , single blind , randomise active control trial intravenous ceftazidime avibactam combination metronidazole versus meropenem . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) treatment minimum 72 hour ( 3 full day , ie , 9 dos ) option switch oral therapy . The decision switch oral therapy entirely Investigator 's discretion , patient good sufficient clinical response , patient tolerate oral fluid food.Patients assess safety efficacy throughout study , blood sample take pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment . The duration patient 's participation study minimum 27 day maximum 50 day start study treatment ( defined time point first dose study treatment administer ) time late follow ( LFU ) assessment visit . The LFU perform 20 35 day last dose treatment.The assessment test cure ( TOC ) visit perform person 8 15 day last dose study drug ( IV oral ) . The maximum duration IV study drug oral switch therapy Day 15 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Must ≥3 calendar month &lt; 18 year age . Patients age ≥3 calendar month &lt; 1 year must bear term ( define gestational age ≥37 week ) . 2 . Written inform consent parent ( ) legally acceptable representative ( ) , informed assent patient ( age appropriate accord local regulation ) 3 . If female reach menarche , reach Tanner stage 3 development ( even reach menarche ) ( refer Appendix E detail Tanner stag ) , patient authorise participate clinical study follow criterion meet : At screening : ( ) Patient report sexual abstinence prior 3 month report use least 1 acceptable method contraception , include intrauterine device ( copper band coil ) , levonorgestrel intrauterine system ( eg , Mirena® ) , regular medroxyprogesterone injection ( DepoProvera® ) ; ( b ) Patient agree initiate sexual abstinence time screen 7 day end treatment study drug ; ( ii ) Patient advise avoid conception time screen 7 day receipt study drug agree attempt pregnancy time screen 7 day end treatment study drug ; ( iii ) Patient provide guideline regard continuation abstinence , initiation abstinence , allow contraception ; ( iv ) Patient negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) test prior study entry . Since serum test may miss early pregnancy , relevant menstrual history sexual history , include method contraception , consider . Note : result serum βhCG test obtain prior dose investigational product , patient may enrol basis negative urine pregnancy test , though serum βhCG test result must still obtain . 4 . Must , base judgment Investigator , require hospitalisation initially antibacterial therapy 7 15 day addition surgical intervention treatment current cIAI 5 . Require surgical intervention ( eg , laparotomy , laparoscopic surgery percutaneous drainage ) manage cIAI 6 . Must clinical evidence cIAI follow : ( ) Preoperative enrolment inclusion : 1 . Requires surgical intervention expect complete within 24 hour enrolment Laparotomy , laparoscopy , percutaneous drainage 2 . Evidence systemic inflammatory response ( least 1 ) : Fever ( defined oral temperature &gt; 38.5°C , equivalent method use ) hypothermia ( core body rectal temperature &lt; 35°C , equivalent method use ) Elevated white blood cell ( WBC ) ( &gt; 15000 cells/mm3 ) Creactive protein ( CRP ) level ( &gt; 10 mg/L ) 3 . Physical Findings consistent intraabdominal infection , : Abdominal pain and/or tenderness Localised diffuse abdominal wall rigidity Abdominal mass 4 . Intention send specimens surgical intervention culture 5 . ( Optional ) Supportive radiologic finding intraabdominal infection , perforate intraperitoneal abscess detect : Computed tomography ( CT ) scan Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Ultrasound ( ii ) Intraoperative/postoperative enrolment inclusion ( case postoperative enrolment , must within 24 hour time incision ) : : Visual confirmation intraabdominal infection associate peritonitis laparotomy , laparoscopy percutaneous drainage ( confirmed pending feasibility ) ; must 1 diagnosis : 1 . Appendiceal perforation periappendiceal abscess 2 . Cholecystitis gangrenous rupture perforation progression infection beyond gallbladder wall 3 . Acute gastric duodenal perforation , operate &gt; 24 hour singular perforation occur 4 . Traumatic perforation intestine , operate &gt; 12 hour perforation occur 5 . Secondary peritonitis ( spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associate cirrhosis chronic ascites ) 1 . Involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) 2 . Previous enrolment randomisation present study 3 . Participation another clinical study investigational product ( IP ) last 30 day first dose IV study drug previously participate current study another study CAZAVI ( active agent receive ) 4 . History hypersensitivity reaction carbapenems , cephalosporin , penicillin , β lactam antibiotic metronidazole nitroimidazole derivative 5 . Concurrent infection , may interfere evaluation response study antibiotic time randomisation 6 . Patient need effective concomitant systemic antibacterial ( oral , IV , intramuscular ) addition designate 2 study group ( CAZAVI plus metronidazole group meropenem group ) ( see Section 7.8 ) 7 . Receipt nonstudy systemic antibacterial drug therapy cIAI continuous duration 24 hour 72 hour precede first dose IV drug , except prove resistant organism and/or worsen clinical condition 24 hour . More 2 consecutive dos permit individual dos expect give &gt; 12 hour ' cover ( ie , give total cover &gt; 24 hour . ) For patient enrolled surgical procedure , 1 dose non study antibiotic permit postoperatively 8 . Patient consider unlikely survive 6 8 week study period 9 . Patient unlikely respond 7 15 day treatment antibiotic 10 . Patient receive haemodialysis peritoneal dialysis 11 . Diagnosis abdominal wall abscess confine musculature abdominal wall ischaemic bowel disease without perforation , traumatic bowel perforation require surgery within 12 hour perforation , perforation gastroduodenal ulcer require surgery within 24 hour perforation ( consider situation peritoneal soil infection become establish ) 12 . Simple ( uncomplicated ) , nonperforated appendicitis gangrenous appendicitis without rupture peritoneal cavity identify surgical procedure OR presence primary peritonitis ( ie , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ) peritonitis associate cirrhosis chronic ascites 13 . At time randomisation , patient know cIAI cause pathogen resistant study antimicrobial plan use study 14 . Presence follow clinically significant laboratory abnormality : 1 .

History seizure , exclude welldocumented febrile seizure childhood 17 . Any situation condition would make patient , opinion Investigator , unsuitable study ( eg , would place patient risk compromise quality data ) may interfere optimal participation study 18 .
