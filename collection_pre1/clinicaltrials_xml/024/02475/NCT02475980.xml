Adolescents experience poverty , coercive sexual relationship , co-morbid psychiatric disorder , abuse especially vulnerable pregnancy . ( 12 ) These risk factor adolescent pregnancy mirror characteristic adolescent utilize emergency department medical care . ( 7-9,13 ) A prior survey female adolescent adult seek care emergency department felt acceptable contraceptive provision emergency department . ( 14 ) It know whether pediatric emergency medical provider successfully initiate contraception adolescent pediatric emergency department . Adolescent girls present UNM Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) currently receive contraceptive sexual health care , care deliver varies base provider . As continue education initiative UNM , Dr. Nancy Sokkary , Adolescent Gynecologist , provide educational session current best contraceptive practice adolescent pediatrician . Included education FDA-approved procedural training insertion subdermal contraceptive implant , Nexplanon . Pediatric resident attend physician begin offer Nexplanon inpatient set pediatric clinic . As PED attend fellow physician , board-certified pediatrician , undergo education , anticipate increase knowledge part PED provider current contraceptive recommendation . This propose research capitalize opportunity expand comprehensive counseling contraception PED . Patients recruit Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) University New Mexico . Investigators enroll adolescent girl 13 18 year age present PED non-emergent complaint willing participate study . Adolescent girls present PED shift staff attend physician fellow train study counsel intervention eligible enrollment . Physicians complete Dr. Sokkary 's continue education best practice adolescent contraception FDA-approved Nexplanon insertion training consider trained counsel intervention . All consent procedure perform PED research coordinator study investigator involve patient 's medical care emergency department encounter . All potentially eligible participant approach research coordinator parent/guardian/companion outside patient room , routine reproductive health care PED . A unique study number assign subject note data collection form contain study number . No patient identifier include data form . All patient offer clinical service regardless decision participate study . If participant withdrawn study either desire PED provider , PI study research staff , may continue receive contraceptive care PED clinician provide clinical service encounter . Patients expect participation involve enrollment subsequent contraceptive counsel intervention consist handout , 10-minute DVD , one-on-one counseling PED attend physician fellow total long one hour . For follow , participant contact telephone study team member approximately 4 week enrollment administer brief ( approximately 10 minute ) survey participant satisfaction counsel intervention subsequent contraceptive choice . Investigators recruit participant 8-week pilot period . Investigators anticipate recruitment complete March 2015 preliminary analysis complete June 2015 . Participants recruit Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) UNM . Physicians Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) train Pediatricians provide specialize care Emergency Medicine . Sixty percent PED attending fellow complete train Dr. Sokkary best practice adolescent contraception Nexplanon insertion September 2014 . Usual care contraceptive counseling PED : The common reason adolescent girl present PED persistent abdominal pain . Other common reason include urinary tract infection , concern sexually transmit infection , pharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection , social stressor , trauma . An adolescent girl 's first point care PED nurse triage . PED visit adolescent girl average total duration 4 hour . During nurse triage , brief history present complaint take , vital sign collect , medical care initiate base nurse-driven protocol . During triage , female adolescent patient routinely interview privately parent/guardian/companion outside room screen pregnancy risk factor . They provide urine specimen cup anticipation urine pregnancy test . Depending chief complaint , triage nurse may privately screen risk factor substance abuse violence . After triage , patient place one 12 private patient room PED . They evaluate one three physician PED depend staff PED time . Medical evaluation routinely consist medical history physical exam . In addition , routine care adolescent PED include social history obtain parent/guardian/companion outside patient 's room protect confidentiality . During confidential portion medical encounter , adolescent ask sexual behavior , contraception , healthy relationship , substance abuse .
