	<brief_summary>It show RFA induced systemic tumor antigen-specific T cell response human carcinoma . However , insufficient study immune modulation tumor microenviroment ( TME ) outside ablation zone . In order study RFA modify TME human cancer patient , investigator perform retrospective study unique cohort patient suffer synchronous CRCLM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic RFA Increases T Cell Infiltraion PD-L1 Expression Primary Colorecatl Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) widely use local treatment tumor small hepatocellular carcinoma , renal cancer solitary colorectal cancer liver metastasis ( CRCLM ) . RFA induce localize coagulation necrosis lead release large amount cellular debris situ , serve source tumor antigens elicit host adaptive immune response tumor . Several study preclinical animal model show localized tumor ablation RFA induce systemic T-cell mediate antitumor immunity . Antigen-specific T cell immune response also observe patient hepatic tumor RFA therapy . However , RFA-induced immune response sufficient prevent tumor recurrence . The underlying mechanism remain obscure . Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) , important immune checkpoint molecule , often up-regulated tumor cell tumor associate myeloid cell . It impair T cell-mediated immune response upon engagement cognate co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 , always highly express tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte . PD-L1 expression induce pro-inflammatory cytokine , especially type I interferon ( IFN ) , important self-limiting mechanism prevent rampant autoimmunity . Recent study show PD-L1 expression tumor cell associate T cell infiltration , suggest PD-L1 actively involve suppress antitumor immune response tumor microenvironment ( TME ) . Whether PD-L1/PD1 axis involve modulate antitumor T cell immune response induce RFA unclear . The objective investigation study RFA-induced immune response tumor tissue cancer patient .</detailed_description>
