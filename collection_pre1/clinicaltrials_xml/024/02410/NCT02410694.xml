	<brief_summary>Overview Study Design : This open phase II , single-arm , multi-center study evaluate progression free survival patient receive ixazomib combination thalidomide dexamethasone ( ITD ) follow ixazomib maintenance phase maximum period 12 month . The patient population consist adult male female patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) relapse and/or refractory disease least one prior treatment line . In case enrollment patient receive ixazomib 4.0mg day 1 , 8 , 15 , thalidomide 100mg day 1 28 ( 50mg patient age ≥75 year ) , dexamethasone 40mg ( 20mg patient age ≥75 year ) day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day treatment cycle . The proposed number cycle 8 . Treatment discontinue case progressive disease case response 4 cycle ( ≤ SD 4 cycle ) . After discontinuation therapy end treatment visit ( EOT ) perform within 14 day last dose last combination treatment cycle . After 8 cycle ITD therapy , maintenance treatment 4.0mg ixazomib ( 3.0mg patient age ≥ 75 year first day maintenance phase ) day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle administer patient ≥ MR maximum period 12 month . Patients complete less 8 cycle ITD treatment qualify maintenance phase . Follow-up visit perform 3-monthly interval last patient ixazomib maintenance therapy conclude discontinue maintenance phase . A safety analysis conduct enrollment first 6 patient completion least two cycle every patient .</brief_summary>
