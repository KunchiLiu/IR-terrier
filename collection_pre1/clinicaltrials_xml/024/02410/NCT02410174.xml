	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy use stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) treatment primary tumor renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) medically inoperable patient and/or patient refuse surgery . Standard treatment RCC surgery . A number non-surgical treatment RCC also available , highly invasive associate significant side effect . SBRT non-invasive , non-surgical treatment require tumor immobilization image guidance order deliver precise , high-dose treatment . This trial ass use SBRT treat primary renal tumor determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity . Subjects enrol study follow evaluated toxicity , serum chemistry , complete blood count , urinalysis . In addition , undergo renal scan assess functionality renal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Treatment Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need non-invasive treatment modality renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patient medically technically inoperable refuse surgery . The primary tumor patient RCC generally manage surgically non-surgical ablative modality , significant toxicity invasiveness associate current surgical percutaneous treatment modality . Stereotactic radiotherapy first develop treat brain metastases intracranial tumor give single high-dose treatment deliver precision less 1 mm . This treatment require immobilization tumor precise image guide treatment . The brain particularly amenable approach since internal brain motion , skull easily fix position , excellent image available . Recent development immobilization image guidance permit precise tumor target extracranial site , liver lung . Stereotactic radiotherapy use extracranial site call stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . Because great precision SBRT , high dose per treatment possible . Early work evaluate SBRT primary metastatic liver lung tumor show excellent result tumor control toxicity . Based , propose expand use technique RCC . In study , investigator seek evaluate safety efficacy SBRT treatment primary tumor renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . One goal study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) renal SBRT determine dose-volume relationship toxicity kidney high dose per fraction SBRT use . In order ensure proper immobilization tumor localization , investigator use abdominal compression , 4D CT scanning time simulation , cone beam CT scanning time treatment . The investigator propose perform Tc-99m glucoheptonate renal scan SBRT ass renal tissue periphery lesion , well baseline follow-up serum chemistry evaluation , creatinine , complete blood count , urinalysis , creatinine clearance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient primary renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) tumor inoperable technical ( i.e surgical ) medical reason Patient must screen urologic surgeon verify eligibility basis Biopsy proof RCC prefer ; however , current practice diagnosis often clinical base characteristic imaging . If compelling clinical reason proceed biopsy , clinical diagnosis suffice . Patient metastasis eligible opinion treat physician patient could benefit treatment primary renal tumor . ECOG performance status 02 Age â‰¥18 year Signed informed consent Inadequate renal function , measure creatinine clearance calculate 24 hour urine collection . Creatinine clearance value least 50 ml/min require Prior attempt curative treatment primary kidney tumor Inability lie still approximately 1 hour immobilization device Presence connective tissue disorder rheumatoid arthritis . Pregnancy Inability develop radiation treatment plan adhere dose constraint describe Radiotherapy Treatment Planning section .</criteria>
