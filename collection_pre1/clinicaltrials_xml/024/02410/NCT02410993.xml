	<brief_summary>According 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline 2014 ESC/EACTS guideline , CABG surgery recommend three-vessel coronary artery disease leave main coronary artery disease patient stable ischemic heart disease class I . 2-VD proximal leave anterior descend artery stenosis also indicate CABG surgery class I recommendation . However , many patient recommend PCI catheterization laboratory cardiologist ; 46 % 93 % only-CABG candidate CABG PCI candidate , retrospectively , define previous ACC/AHA guideline . Although discordance real practice catheterization laboratory guideline would adjust recently update guideline . The revascularization strategy patient 3-VD/LMD real practice get toward PCI le CABG surgery . In study , identify rate CABG candidate treat PCI medical treatment instead CABG surgery different current guideline . We also go compare two treatment strategy CABG surgery vs. PCI 2nd generation DES regard clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
