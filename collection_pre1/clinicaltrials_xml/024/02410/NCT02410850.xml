	<brief_title>Long Term Oral Appliance Therapy Effectiveness Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) chronic condition may occur individual sleeping . OSA incidence rate range 4 16 % adult population . The prevalence OSA even high population cardiovascular metabolic disorder ( e.g . stroke diabetes mellitus ) . OSA characterize five pause breathe per hour partial obstruction airway sleep . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) currently treat use two method : oral appliance ( OA ) therapy continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Although American Academy Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) approve method first line treatment mild moderate OSA , oral appliance underutilized despite non-invasive , quietness , fact non-surgical , cost effectiveness . OAs also alternative severe OSA patient find CPAP treatment intolerable . There two major group OAs available , one act reposition mandible tongue ; include mandibular advancement splint ( MAS ) Mandibular advancement device ( MAD ) . The group OAs , tongue retain device ( TRD ) focus hold tongue forward . It position tongue mandible OAs effective decrease sleep apnea . OA therapy long-term treatment therefore important appliance comfortable encourage patient use . Despite benefit patient use OAs , previous study look relationship OAs OSA long term study large number patient . This lack research knowledge lead absence training education dentists able provide OA therapy patient . OAs show effective CPAP help OSA , however , similar effect blood pressure , quality life , sleepiness endothelial function . Previous study show effect OA therapy patient ' OSA associate acceptance adherence . Previous longitudinal study follow patient use CPAP show great benefit term cardiovascular health . It therefore necessary large sample size , long term prospective cohort study do determine effective OA therapy patient OSA , also look potential effect cardiovascular morbidity mortality . It reason 15 centre 9 county around world form network call ORANGE ( Oral Appliance Network Global Effectiveness ) dedicate long-term outcome OAs . These center include : University Sidney ( Australia ) , Stanford University ( USA ) . Kaiser Permanente ( USA ) , Cambridge University ( UK ) , Paris Hospital ( France ) , University Antwerp ( Belgium ) , Japan Somnology Center ( Japan ) , Kyushu University ( Japan ) , University British Columbia ( Canada ) , University Montreal ( Canada ) , Laval University ( Canada ) , University Gronigen ( Netherlands ) , Umea University ( Sweden ) .</detailed_description>
