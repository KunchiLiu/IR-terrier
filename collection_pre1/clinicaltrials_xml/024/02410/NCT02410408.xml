	<brief_summary>Adverse event also cause suffer health professional involve ( second victim ) . This study aim design evaluate two application staff hospital primary care setting intention improve capacity conduct Root Cause Analysis ( RCA ) help introduce patient safety certification ( PSC ) . A single-blind randomized control trial shall conduct control experimental group ( N=84 ) case . The characteristic apps shall specify base suggestion health professional shall design Android IOS ( iPhone Ipad ) . The randomly subject control group shall receive oral write information experimental group use App two month . Pre- post- measure shall include : patient safety knowledge culture self-perceived capacity enhance RCA follow-up PSC . In experimental group , data shall also collect previous experience information communication technology , rating App . The inter-group intervention effect shall calculate univariate linear model ANOVA , pre- post-intervention difference dependent variable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adverse event ( AEs ) cause harm suffer patient may also markedly affect work , family personal life health professional involve , second victim , well damage reputation affect health organization ( third victim ) , undermine people 's trust institution . Between 28 57 % physician ( 79-89 % case resident ) recognize involve medical error serious consequence one patient point career , 90 % believe hospital insufficient help support professional follow AE . In Spain , extrapolate national AE data hospital primary care , estimate 15 % healthcare professional involve type event per year . Guidelines recommendation role staff directive health institution field safety patient develop aim reduce impact adverse event second third victim . The root cause analysis ( RCA ) patient safety certification ( PSC ) system follow International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) rule two example intervention staff direct responsibility . In study investigator design assess two apps design Android IOS ( iPhone Ipad ) help staff conduct RCA implement PSC . To evaluate Apps investigator opt single-blind experimental design two group ( control experimental ) pre- and- post assessment . Subjects shall randomly assign control experimental group . The control group shall compose subject use experimental device , experimental group people use tool two month . To maintain single-blind able link pre- post- measurement , subject shall assign code function date birth initial . The investigator randomly select 84 subject health district Spain develop directive function . Exclusion criterion : less 3 year professional experience . The sample size calculate detect difference mean least 10 point statistical power 90 % level significance Î± = 0.05 ( two-tailed test ) . The investigator request informed consent patient control experimental group . All participate shall complete questionnaire ass patient safety knowledge culture well self-efficacy . Those control group receive oral write information regard patient safety certification Root Cause Analysis . Participants experimental group give apps instal personalize accord institution . Two month later , measurement make pre-intervention shall repeat . Additionally , subject experimental group also shall ask evaluate apps ( performance , functionality , usability , reliability , acceptability , usefulness , design , simplicity , accessibility , problem-solving power well overall satisfaction tool ) . In order ass effectiveness apps , shall build various univariate linear model , inter-group difference pre-intervention measurement , perform univariate linear model ANOVA , use dependent variable difference pre- post-intervention measurement .</detailed_description>
