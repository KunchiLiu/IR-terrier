	<brief_summary>NAG protein excrete urine case tubular damage , consider biomarker kidney injury . Elevated urinary NAG see cardiac surgery , clinical significance , pattern excretion link perioperative factor poorly describe . We plan study pattern NAG-excretion cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass , explore possible associate variable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAG-excretion During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard biomarker AKI , serum creatinine , poor specificity sensitivity early phase renal injury . Since therapeutic window likely earlier stage renal injury manifest , need novel diagnostic method . In recent year , several new biomarkers kidney injury introduce . To date , none proven outstanding regard precision early detection AKI . NAG ( N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase ) lysosomal enzyme high molecular weight . Due size , NAG normally pass glomerulus apparatus , urine level elevate tubulus damage . NAG excretion urine see AKI cardiac surgery , exposure nephrotoxic agent renal transplantation . However , role clinical decision-making yet establish . We aim study excretion pattern urinary NAG cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . Association perioperative variable explore .</detailed_description>
