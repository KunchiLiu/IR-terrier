	<brief_title>Use Feasibility iThermonitor Pediatrics Patients Myelosuppresive Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neutropenia , secondary myelosupressive therapy , predispose patient significant risk infectious complication increase morbidity mortality . Usually , fever first clinical sign inflammatory response infective process ; early detection indication empiric antimicrobial therapy evaluation determine risk sepsis . Today , broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy first detection fever help significantly decrease mortality associate neutropenia intensive phase chemotherapy . Therefore , early detection fever , regular temperature monitoring , neutropenic patient critical improve clinical outcome . Vigilance part care provider care giver crucial early detection . Traditionally , simply do episodic oral axillary monitoring temperature . In study , propose test use feasibility innovative device continuously monitor body temperature clinical decision support tool pediatric patient undergo myelosuppressive therapy acute leukemias childhood cancer . The iThermonitor , FDA class II device , high accuracy device continuously monitor body temperature connects receiver ( iPad mini ) via bluetooth display body temperature data real time . The iThermonitor attach skin hydrogel dress change need . It capture data even without connection receiver establish connection pair receiver device ( iPad mini ) within range three meter . The provided iPad mini pre-loaded iThermonitor app use pair receiver iThermonitor device . The device monitor body temperature every four second able store 10 day worth data offload soon establishes connection receiver . It able measure temperature range 25-45 degree Celsius . Users able set temperature limit alert out-of-range temperature go . It also provide care provider opportunity remotely monitor patient ' temperature immediate period discharge hospital . Therefore , hypothesize iThermonitor serve feasible clinical decision support management pediatric patient undergo intensive treatment acute leukemia childhood cancer . This study implement pilot study test use feasibility iThermonitor clinical decision support continuous temperature monitoring dyad 25 pediatrics patient , ( age 2yrs - 17yrs ) myelosuppressive therapy acute leukemia childhood cancer MGH Pediatric Hematology Oncology group , caregiver . The iThermonitor use patient caregiver home 2-week study period start day chemotherapy . There two study visit : study enrollment study closeout . The investigator choose implement study feasibility study investigator ' goal determine continuous temperature monitoring iThermonitor work home setting . To investigator ' knowledge , researcher aware previous research explore continuous temperature monitor pediatric oncology patient myelosuppresive therapy . Therefore , finding study potential advance knowledge management fever pediatric patient myelosuppresive therapy .</detailed_description>
