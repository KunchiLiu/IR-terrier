	<brief_summary>Rectal toxicity limit dose escalate intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) prostate cancer . The dose volume constraint predict rectal toxicity require minimize prostate motion rectum bladder fill IMRT .5-15 . The volumetric change internal organ motion prostate IMRT increase risk PSA failure patient large rectum plan CT scan . Patient preparation IMRT plan crucial .The literature limit regard effectiveness educational intervention behavioral reinforcement patient , gap exists literacy level consider . Patients often comprehend verbal write instruction difficulty follow recommend regimens.23 Using multimedia Internet , audio-visual medium DVD even telephone enhance patient ' knowledge understand importance preparation IMRT prostate ca . Thomas 's study show patient undergo radiotherapy chemotherapy , video group lower anxiety score compare non video group . At SOCC patient provide verbal information bladder rectum preparation prostate planning CT scan IMRT . Patients `` fullish '' bladder empty rectum time CT simulation . If rectal diameter &gt; 4cm , patient ask empty stool/gas re-scanned . The 3- month review patient preparedness prostate IMRT show 13/55 patient adequately prepared 42/55 ( 76 % ) patient need re-scanned due inadequate bladder ( 21/42 , 50 % ) rectum fill 28/42 , 67 % ) . Also , 2/13 ( 15 % ) patient still prepared second resimulation despite receive phone call instruction . The investigator plan investigate multimedia education strategy decrease costly resimulation rate patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Instructional Video Patients ' Compliance With Preparation During CT Planning Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 23,600 men diagnose prostate cancer Canada 2014 . This represent 24 % new cancer case men 2014 . The SOCC treat 1000 patient prostate cancer annually . Patients fail follow instruction initial prostate planning CT scan need return rescanned later date . Additional CTs increase patient ' park transportation cost may increase anxiety . Rescanning may also cause stress radiation therapist due unsuccessful planning , increase cost cancer centre additional time radiation therapist increase plan CT wait time patient . Thus improve patient ' preparedness prostate planning CT scan reduce cost patient hospital , reduce anxiety stress patient practitioner , reduce CT scan wait time , maximize accuracy prostate IMRT . In study 220 patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy , Thomas use video education Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HAD ) find significant correlation satisfaction reduce overall treatment relate anxiety video group22 . Purpose To determine effectiveness introduction video patient preparedness patient receive CT Scan radiotherapy prostate . Methods The project consist three phase : video production , experiment data collection , analysis dissemination . 1 . Video production - The investigator produce instructional video , test video , revise base initial feedback . Christopher Townsend Sunnybrook Media produce video use script write Agnes Ryzynski , input team member . The script highlight importance rectal bladder preparation prior plan CT scan . Images present show normal abnormal preparation example , instruct patient prepare plan CT scan . The video test patient radiation oncologist , nurse radiation therapist prior launch . 2 . Experiment data collection - The investigator use control experimental group design . The RA recruit sixty participant pre-planning appointment date via telephone . The RA present study rationale ; agree participate sign study consent , assign study entry number . Participants randomly assign either control group experimental group . The sample size calculate base observed proportion patient need rescanned : 0.76 ( 42/55 ) . To treatment group proportion 0.38 need rescanned , 50 % decrease , investigator need least 25 patient group power 0.8 , give 0.05 significance level . To account study attrition ( 20 % loss participant ) , investigator require 30 subject per group observe large treatment effect ( e.g . 50 % decrease proportion rescanning ) . 3 . Data analysis dissemination - A statistical analysis conduct patient preparedness data . The investigator conduct quantitative analysis evaluation form use Likert scale . Patients ' evaluation also contain open end question capture patient ' comment experience study . The investigator analyze detail patient ' radiation therapist ' satisfaction patient ' knowledge video content . Confidentiality Patient confidentiality assure . All patient assign study number name disclose time . All study data keep locked cabinet , investigator access .</detailed_description>
