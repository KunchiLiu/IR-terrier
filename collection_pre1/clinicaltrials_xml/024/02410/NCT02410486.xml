	<brief_title>Early-Onset Sepsis NICHD/CDC Surveillance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal pathogen group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) resistant beta-lactam antibiotic emerge common etiologic agent EOS EOM among preterm term neonate result high mortality rate , potentially offset decrease burden early-onset GBS disease prevent maternal intrapartum chemoprophylaxis . Primary Outcomes study : 1 . To determine current hospital-based rate early-onset neonatal infection ( total , GA-specific BW-specific , pathogen-specific ) term preterm infant era maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis prevent vertical transmission group B streptococcal disease . Early-onset infection comprise EOS and/or EOM define isolation pathogen blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtain within 72 hour birth provision appropriate antibiotic treatment 5 day ( &lt; 5 day death occur receive antibiotic therapy ) . 2 . To determine antimicrobial susceptibility pattern organisms associate EOS EOM The case control aspect study address 2 major conundrum regard EOS : Can identify risk factor early-onset Gram-negative infection might lead intervention strategy reduce risk identify infant born mother clinical chorioamnionitis high risk early-onset sepsis thus warrant antibiotic treatment soon birth ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Case Surveillance : Live born infant gestational age least 22 week birth weight &gt; 400 g &lt; 72 hour age deliver NRN hospital earlyonset sepsis meningitis define isolation pathogen blood CSF obtain within 72 hour birth provision appropriate antibiotic treatment 5 day ( &lt; 5 day death occur receive antibiotic therapy ) . Controls : Live born infant gestational age least 22 week birth weight &gt; 400 g deliver NRN hospital evaluate earlyonset sepsis ( &lt; 72 hour age ) evaluate , sterile blood and/or CSF culture treat prolonged antibiotic clinical `` culture negative '' sepsis . Controls infant Gramnegative infection infant without earlyonset infection . Controls infant born mother clinical chorioamnionitis infant without earlyonset infection bear mother clinical chorioamnionitis . Control infants bear hospital case , gestational age grouping case ( 22 0/7 28 6/7 week ; 29 0/7 33 6/7 week ; 34 0/7 36 6/7 week ; ≥ 37 week ) . Stillbirths infant die delivery room exclude . Infants die within 12 hour age exclude evaluate possible infection—ie , blood culture obtain identify EOS .</criteria>
