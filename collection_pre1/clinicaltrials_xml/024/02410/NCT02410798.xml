	<brief_title>Clinical Study Investigate Safety Performance TransLoc Electrodes Patients Undergoing Surgical Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , single-center study examine feasibility TransLoc DPS electrode placement removal . Twelve ( 12 ) subject undergo surgical procedure receive device ( four electrode ) follow electrode removal seven day post-procedure . Subjects select surgical candidate undergo laparoscopic , open abdominal , open thoracic procedure . The primary endpoint identify show viability procedure integrity system placement , use , monitoring , removal electrode . The secondary endpoint identify determine effectiveness electrode placement . The long-term intent investigation avoid effect ventilator induce diaphragm dysfunction ( VIDD ) associate complication cost , improve quality patient care .</detailed_description>
