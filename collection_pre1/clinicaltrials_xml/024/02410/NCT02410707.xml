	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe safety efficacy nitrous oxide administration pain anxiety propofol patient require procedure sedation Emergency Department . Procedural sedation use sedative , analgesic , and/or dissociative agent relieve anxiety pain associate diagnostic therapeutic procedure . Propofol commonly use sedative amnestic , provide analgesia . Short act opioids may use pain relief , come risk respiratory depression . An optimum analgesic relieve pain patient need procedural sedation short acting , easy administer safe . Nitrous oxide may suitable agent , literature support reject use adult lack . This study aim fill gap . Adult patient capable consenting , come Emergency Department painful condition require procedural sedation target population . Eligible patient consent study receive Nitrous Oxide gas deliver hand hold mask receive propofol procedure . Information regard vitals , pain score medical condition also collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study conduct prospective , non-randomized fashion use convenience sample 100 subject undergoing sedation Emergency Department procedure . Recruitment Methods The research associate well health care team ( resident attend physician ) screen patient may need procedural sedation Emergency Department may qualify study . Research associate use Medical Record Procedures Involved Research Initial medical assessment make accordance establish clinical procedure , include history , physical examination , vital sign . If clinical assessment patient meet eligibility criterion , approach research associate enrollment study . After informed consent obtain prior start sedation , standard vital sign monitoring place patient ( electrocardiogram , non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , pulse oximetry , capnography ) . Level consciousness determine use modify Ramsay scale , assessed baseline . The Entitled Carbon Di Oxide ( CO2 ) monitor use primary device measure Entitled Carbon Di Oxide ( CO2 ) , nasal cannula capable deliver supplemental oxygen measure Entitled CO2 . The Nitrous Oxide gas mixer system use primary nitrous oxide delivery device . It mix deliver nitrous oxide oxygen 1:1 ratio , fix concentration 50 % /50 % . It use patient driven demand valve system hand hold . This device provide consistent , fixed 50 % /50 % blend nitrous oxide ( N2O ) oxygen ( O2 ) , eliminate need titrate , provide fixed concentration control consistent dosing . The device comparator detect dose imbalance protect hypoxic mixture , deliver nitrous gas without concurrent oxygen , device anti-asphyxia valve override . The demand valve require patient inspiration trigger dose . This portable device scavenges exhale waste gas environmental safety , well key mechanism render system inoperable without security . After informed consent , patient fill pre procedure questionnaire 100 mm VAS baseline pain scale . The patient give mask delivery nitrous oxide , instruct use . The research associate mark time patient begin use device electronically . Once IV access establish , team patient ready begin procedure , nitrous oxide mask remove , 100 % non rebreather mask deliver 15 liter minute supplemental oxygen place patient face . The load dose propofol administer immediately . All sedation trial use propofol 1.0 mg/Kg initial dose , 0.5 mg/Kg dos titrate deep sedation . Once patient deeply sedate , procedure begin . The subject 's clinical data sedation information ( refer data management ) enter standardize data collection form . The data continuously record throughout sedation recovery period . Study end subject recovers back baseline mental status . Vital sign flag electronically physician intervenes clinical respiratory depression . Respiratory depression define peripheral Oxygen saturation 92 % , Entitled CO2 level 50 , rise decrease 10 % baseline , loss Entitled CO2 waveform 15 second . Level consciousness determine use modify Ramsay scale , record baseline point deep sedation . Once procedure complete , patient deem back mental status baseline , fill post procedure satisfaction questionnaire , 100 mm VAS scale . They ask procedure recall . The physician nurse involve also fill post procedure questionnaire . System screen , charge informed consent , enrollment , placement capnography monitor , well data collection . The health care team charge procedural sedation management .</detailed_description>
