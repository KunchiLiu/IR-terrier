	<detailed_description>Lower urinary tract dysfunction ( LUTD ) multiple cause include bladder outlet obstruction ( BOO ) result benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) neurological disease include spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Manifestations LUTD include storage symptom increase daytime frequency , nocturia , urgency urinary incontinence void symptom slow stream , hesitancy incomplete emptying . The consequence BOO-induced ( BLUTD ) neurogenic LUTD ( NLUTD ) , lead functional entity include low compliance high pressure bladder well acontractile high volume low pressure bladder , believe share pathogenetic mechanism . In previous project , investigator establish micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression profile several urodynamically define state BLUTD . In follow-up project , investigator propose extend study , undertake comparative miRNA RNA profile BLUTD NLUTD , investigate dynamic alteration microRNA expression different functional manifestation disease . The investigator propose validate primary gene target miRNAs differentially express urodynamically define state BLUTD identify signal pathway , activate progression hypertrophy decompensation . Monitoring reversal change miRNA expression relief obstruction restoration normal bladder function help delineate key BOO-induced miRNAs regulatory potential . Similarly , dynamic miRNA alteration , observed SCI patient development management NLUTD reveal role miRNA gene expression regulation neurogenic-induced organ remodelling . By uncover molecular similarity difference BLUTD NLUTD , investigator elucidate causative factor development disorder highlight impact myogenic neurogenic component postulate involve . The project involve close collaboration clinical basic research , combine analysis human biopsy material vitro cell-based assay , create comprehensive platform dissection molecular mechanism LUTD . This project keep momentum investigator ' previous research contribute basic applied study bladder remodel . It logical continuation on-going study role miRNAs LUT disorder represent novel direction research high diagnostic therapeutic potential .</detailed_description>
