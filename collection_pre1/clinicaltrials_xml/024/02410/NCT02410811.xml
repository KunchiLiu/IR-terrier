	<brief_title>Novel Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Define Unique Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) cause progressive cardiopulmonary morbidity , begin childhood , ultimately fatal . As group , cardiopulmonary complication , acute chest syndrome sudden death , common cause death SCD , especially adolescents adult . Patients SCD feature anemia-related , high cardiac output state restrictive cardiomyopathy ( RCM ) . The investigator propose unique RCM overlook understudied complication SCD . RCM could explain modest increase pulmonary artery pressure patient SCD , measure cardiac catheterization estimate tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity ( TRJV ) , often attribute primary pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . RCM could also cause unexplained sudden cardiac death SCD , feature form RCM . The investigator overarch hypothesis increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) -mediated angiotensin-1 receptor ( AT1R ) -TGFβ1 signal pro-fibrotic , combination vaso-occlusive ischemia-reperfusion injury , result age-dependent , progressive RCM detect non-invasive cardiac imaging . This pilot , longitudinal , observational study use novel , comprehensive , multimodal cardiac imaging strategy , combine cutting-edge cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) , demonstrate unique RCM SCD , characterize frequency temporal evolution 2-year period . The investigator also correlate RCM phenotype biomarkers ROS renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) -TGFβ1 signal . This research could change investigator understand SCD affect heart lung . The investigator propose study change current concept primary pulmonary vasculopathy cardiomyopathy-centered model secondary pulmonary vascular change lead sudden death . This translational pilot study deliver novel , clear , quantifiable CMR phenotype establish diagnostic performance use phase II/III clinical trial test anti-fibrotic therapy prevent reverse SCD-related RCM .</detailed_description>
