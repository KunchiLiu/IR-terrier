	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether one two four-month regimen tuberculosis treatment effective standard six-month regimen treatment pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) . All three regimen administer daily , seven day week , direct observation dose health-care worker least five seven day week . The standard six-month regimen two month isoniazid , rifampin , ethambutol , pyrazinamide follow four month isoniazid rifampin . The first short regimen single substitution rifapentine rifampin : two month isoniazid , rifapentine , ethambutol , pyrazinamide , follow two month isoniazid rifapentine . The second short regimen double substitution rifapentine rifampin moxifloxacin ethambutol : two month isoniazid , rifapentine , moxifloxacin , pyrazinamide , follow two month isoniazid , rifapentine , moxifloxacin . Target enrollment 2500 participant . Each study participant remain study 18 month order include least 12 month evaluation whether participant 's TB recurs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TBTC Study 31 : Rifapentine-containing Tuberculosis Treatment Shortening Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : Rifapentine-containing treatment shorten regimen pulmonary tuberculosis : randomize , open-label , control , phase 3 clinical trial Hypotheses : A ) Seventeen ( 17 ) week rifapentine-based regimen In previously untreated individual active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treat eight week rifapentine ( P ) , isoniazid ( H ) , pyrazinamide ( Z ) ethambutol ( E ) follow nine week rifapentine plus isoniazid , give daily throughout , proportion participant experience absence cure ( unfavorable outcome ) inferior observed participant treat standard regimen ( eight week rifampin ( R ) , isoniazid , pyrazinamide ethambutol follow eighteen week rifampin plus isoniazid ) , give daily throughout . B ) Seventeen ( 17 ) week rifapentine- plus moxifloxacin-containing regimen In previously untreated individual active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treat eight week rifapentine , isoniazid , pyrazinamide moxifloxacin ( M ) , follow nine week rifapentine , isoniazid , moxifloxacin , give daily throughout , proportion participant experience absence cure ( unfavorable outcome ) inferior observed participant treat standard regimen ( eight week rifampin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide ethambutol follow eighteen week rifampin plus isoniazid ) , give daily throughout . Phase : 3 Design : This international , multicenter , randomize , control , open-label , 3-arm , phase 3 non-inferiority trial . Population : Patients newly diagnose , previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis . Number Sites : Multiple international site , primarily sit Tuberculosis Trials Consortium AIDS Clinical Trials Group . Study Duration : Duration per participant approximately 18 month . Description Agent Intervention : After write informed consent , participant randomly assign receive one follow oral regimen : Regimen 1 ( control regimen ) : 2RHZE/4RH - Eight week daily treatment rifampin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , ethambutol , follow - Eighteen week daily treatment rifampin isoniazid Regimen 2 ( investigational regimen ) : 2PHZE/2PH - Eight week daily treatment rifapentine , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , ethambutol , follow - Nine week daily treatment rifapentine isoniazid Regimen 3 ( investigational regimen ) : 2PHZM/2PHM - Eight week daily treatment rifapentine , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin , follow - Nine week daily treatment rifapentine , isoniazid , moxifloxacin Objectives : Primary : - To evaluate efficacy rifapentine-containing regimen determine whether single substitution rifapentine rifampin make possible reduce seventeen week duration treatment drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis - To evaluate efficacy rifapentine-containing regimen addition substitute moxifloxacin ethambutol continue moxifloxacin continuation phase determine whether possible reduce seventeen week duration treatment drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis Secondary : - To evaluate safety investigational regimens - To evaluate tolerability investigational regimens - To collect store biospecimens consent participant purpose future research discovery validation TB biomarkers - To determine correlation mycobacterial clinical marker time culture conversion , culture status completion eight week treatment , treatment failure , relapse . - To conduct pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) study test drug . The main objective PK/PD study characterize study drug PK parameter determine relationship treatment outcomes PK parameter . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics efavirenz-based antiretroviral treatment among patient TB/HIV co-infection take efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy TB treatment rifapentine Endpoints : Primary Endpoints : - Efficacy : TB disease-free survival twelve month study treatment assignment . - Safety : Proportion participant grade 3 high adverse event study drug treatment Secondary Endpoints : - TB disease-free survival eighteen month study treatment assignment - Time stable sputum culture conversion ( solid liquid medium consider separately ) - Speed decline sputum viable bacillus automate liquid MGIT culture day detection - Proportion participant culture negative completion eight week treatment ( solid liquid medium consider separately ) - Sensitivity analyse assume participant classify 'not assessable ' favorable outcome - Discontinuation assign treatment reason microbiological ineligibility - Estimated steady state efavirenz PK parameter include mid-dosing interval concentration</detailed_description>
