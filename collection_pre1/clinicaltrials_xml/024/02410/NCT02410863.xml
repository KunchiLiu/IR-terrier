	<detailed_description>In open-label , multi-center , clinical phase II study melanoma patient stage III ( non-resectable ) stage IV sort Cohort A , B C accord previous BRAF-treatment : Cohort A ( BRAFi naïve ) : Patients receive prior BRAFi MEKi-therapy . Dabrafenib ( BRAFi ) trametinib ( MEKi ) administer orally recommended dos combination therapy 150 mg twice daily ( BID ) 2 mg daily ( QD ) . Clinical endpoint clinical response week 8 . Metabolic response assess week 2 8 . Treatment continue disease progression , death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Cohort B ( BRAFi rechallenge ) : Patients complete partial ( CR/PR ) response best response previous BRAFi treatment ( include limit dabrafenib , vemurafenib ) , discontinuation therapy progression different therapy &gt; 3 month prior enrollment . Dabrafenib ( BRAFi ) administer orally recommended monotherapy dose 150 mg twice daily ( BID ) . Clinical endpoint clinical response week 8 . Metabolic response assess week 2 8 . If patient classify metabolically `` non-responders '' week 2 switch dabrafenib / trametinib combination therapy . After week 8 patient cohort B treat dabrafenib / trametinib combination therapy disease progression , death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Cohort C ( BRAFi / MEKi rechallenge ) : Patients CR/PR best response previous BRAFi / MEKi combination therapy , discontinuation therapy progression different therapy &gt; 3 month prior enrollment . These patient receive dabrafenib trametinib recommend combination therapy dose 150 mg twice daily ( BID ) 2 mg daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue disease progression , death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Survival assess every 3 month final dose BRAFi / MEKi end follow-up phase individual patient . Follow phase subject 1 year follow first treatment dose . End study recruitment finish plus 1 year post start treatment last patient thus ensure 1 year survival rate estimate . Biopsies take start treatment , 2 week ( +/- 4 day ) progressive disease analyze Next generation sequencing ( NGS ) , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , phosphorplex Luminex well reverse phase protein array order determine magnitude suppression downstream signal well reactivation adaptative mechanism . Rebiopsy mandatory 2 week case progressive disease order determine mechanism adaptation signal pathway downstream . The experimental molecular data analyze correlation clinical response week 8 ( define partial complete response accord RECIST ) metabolic response week 2 8 ( responder define patient change &gt; 66 % Standard Uptake value ( SUVmax ) interim PET baseline PET .</detailed_description>
