	<brief_summary>While fair amount clinical data Stargardt disease type 1 ( STGD1 ) publish , little know Stargardt disease type 4 ( STGD4 ) . The ProgStar 04 study important opportunity leverage infrastructure , clinical trial site , method , central reading center ProgStar program investigate progression STGD4 help establish patient cohort worldwide future clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Progression Atrophy Secondary Stargardt Disease Type 4 : PROM1-Related Macular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PROM1 gene code protein call Prominin 1 ( PROM1 ; also know CD133 AC133 ) , know original use human stem cell-specific marker . In retina , PROM1 involve formation organization disk within outer segment ( OS ) photoreceptors . It within particular region electrochemical signal response light generate ( visual cycle-phototransduction ) . In STGD4 , mutation PROM1 gene result defective isoform PROM1 protein become trap myoid region photoreceptors migrate OS site disk form . Ultimately , absence PROM1 OS affect growth organization disk , lead disk malfunction vision problem . Although many advance genetic science help recognize variant STGD , comprehensive description natural history , include variability cone rod dysfunction , STGD variant available . While know treatment STGD time , preparation future therapeutic approach plan clinical trial must include understanding disease , variability , progression correlation visual loss . Moreover , clinical trial aim slow progression and/or restore vision require validate outcome measure prove treatment efficacy . However , outcomes establish STGD overall . In summary , characterization STGD4-specific clinical manifestation , progression prognosis well identification outcome measure clinical trial critical develop new clinical trial STGD4 . Hence , ProgStar 4 develop prospective longitudinal observational study patient mutation PROM1 gene phenotype consistent STGD .</detailed_description>
