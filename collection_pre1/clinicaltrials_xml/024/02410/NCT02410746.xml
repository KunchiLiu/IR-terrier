	<brief_summary>Effective postoperative pain control essential component surgery . Adequate analgesia improves patient comfort satisfaction , thereby permit early mobilisation , fast recovery less likelihood complications.The majority surgeon place 10ml local anaesthetic breast pocket inject breast skin follow breast surgery . A specific technique identify nerve supply breast put local anaesthetic directly around ( Pec block ) . This nerve block recently describe increasingly used anaesthetist surgery local anaesthetic post-operative analgesia . It show provide well specific pain relief several study . Anaesthetists use ultrasound machine identify anatomical landmark nerve inject vicinity . They direct vision risk cause morbidity block effective . It much easier surgeon apply block , see anatomical landmark . Despite , surgeon aware technique . The study group consist patient undergoing bilateral cosmetic breast surgery BMI Edgbaston Priory hospital Spire Parkway Southbank hospital Birmingham Worcester . If patient consent involve research , one breast randomise receive pec block contralateral ( opposite ) breast receive amount local anaesthetic place breast pocket non-targeted fashion . The patient researcher blind allocation . Patients complete verbal numeric pain score breast set interval discharged.In addition , investigator specifically ask breast painful time point . The result study may improve patient care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nerve Block Versus Non-targeted Local Anaesthesia Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ' intention randomise patient undergoing bilateral breast surgery receive specific pec block one breast standard infiltration non target anaesthesia breast . 10ml 0.25 % Chirocaine use breast . All patient attend plastic surgery clinic BMI Edgbaston , BMI Priory , Spire Parkway Spire Southbank request bilateral breast surgery approach take part study . They give information take home opportunity ask question study . All consent patient meet inclusion criterion one breast randomise study group ( pec block ) control group ( standard local anaesthetic infiltration ) . Patients randomise computer generate code . The patient researcher blind . By necessity , surgeon aware randomisation involvement data collection analysis result . Both group receive standard post-operative care follow . A dose morphine 0.1mg/kg give intra-operatively . Thereafter morphine 0.1mg/kg give breakthrough pain . Patients prescribe regular paracetamol ibuprofen . The investigator prospectively record post operative pain rat verbal numerical rating scale 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 hour post-operatively 24 hour . In addition investigator record breast patient indicate painful post-operative complication throughout study period . The expected recruitment period six month . If patient consent inclusion study sign consent form second appointment day surgery . The ward recovery nurse already experience administer VNRS pain control .</detailed_description>
