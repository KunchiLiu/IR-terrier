	<detailed_description>Glaucoma progressive optic neuropathy lead retinal ganglion cell death typical optic nerve head ( ONH ) damage [ 1 ] . It remain disease unclear complex underlie pathophysiology . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) main modifiable risk factor glaucoma [ 2 ] . Although lower IOP help decelerate stabilize disease , vast number patient still show sign glaucoma despite IOP within normal range . Clearly pathogenetic mechanism beyond IOP involved pathogenesis glaucoma certain individual . Non-IOP factor low systolic ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) , reduce ocular blood flow , cardiovascular disease , low systolic blood pressure ( BP ) identify risk factor primary open-open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) [ 3-6 ] . Evidence show non-IOP factor impact apoptotic process associate glaucoma [ 7 ] . Recently , researcher emphasize IOP vascular dysregulation , also intracranial pressure 's ( ICP ) role glaucoma [ 8-10 ] . The optic nerve expose IOP eye , also ICP surround cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) subarachnoid space . Because lamina cribrosa separate two pressurized region [ 11 ] , decrease pressure occur across lamina cribrosa ( IOP-ICP ) know translaminar pressure gradient ( TPG ) . A high TPG may lead abnormal function optic nerve damage due change axonal transportation , deformation lamina cribrosa , alter blood flow , combination thereof lead glaucomatous damage . Besides , TPG may primarily pressure-related parameter glaucoma [ 12-15 ] , since ONH locate junction intraocular space orbital retrobulbar space . However , role TPG still remain unknown , invasive ICP measurement available within contemporary medicine ( lumbar puncture punction brain ventricles—for patient severe brain injury ) . The idea noninvasive ICP measurement appear since 1980 . Numerous method find object physiological characteristic cerebrospinal system would relate ICP monitor seek many author . Most proposed technology base ultrasound capable monitoring blood flow intracranial intraocular vessel , cranium diameter , acoustic property cranium [ 16 ] . Broad research extend sonography optic nerve sheath relation elevate ICP [ 17 ] . However , correlation-based method problem—the need individual patient specific calibration . Seeking measure absolute ICP value , researcher Kaunas University Technology create noninvasive method , need patient specific calibration [ 18 , 19 ] . The method base direct comparison ICP value value pressure Pe externally apply tissue surround eyeball . Intracranial segment ophthalmic artery ( OA ) use natural sensor ICP extracranial segment OA use sensor Pe . A special two depth transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) device [ 18 , 19 ] use pressure balance indicator ICP = Pe . Accuracy , precision , sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic value method proven healthy subject patient neurological disease . This device yet use clinical study investigate TPG significance glaucoma . The aim study assess TPG patient primary open open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . In addition investigator want measure ICP patient papilledema ( PE ) order compare glaucoma patient . The non-invasive ICP measurement use two deep TCD device allow u get ICP value immediate vicinity optic nerve , turn important term understand pathophysiology condition like PE POAG .</detailed_description>
