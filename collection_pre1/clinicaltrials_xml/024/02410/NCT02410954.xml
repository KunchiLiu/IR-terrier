	<brief_summary>Locus coeruleus ( LC ) norepinephrine ( NE ) neuron activity convincingly link regulation acute fear . This study address whether LC NE activity examine pupil measure reflect carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) induce fear-responses human transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) mitigate effect . A 2 year R21 phase establish feasibility , tolerability , safety , proof-of-concept ( POC ) term capacity engage LC NE neuron tDCS , follow 3 year R33 parallel-group , double-blind , randomize , control trial determine degree engage LC NE neuron tDCS improve clinical symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Treatment Acute Fear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Institutes Mental Health ( NIMH ) recently identify major limitation understand neuropsychiatric disorder development treatment condition inability identify key dimension observable behavior central disorder link underlying neurobiology measurable biomarkers . This project intend address problem establish pupillary measure norepinephrine ( NE ) neuronal activity biomarkers fear dimension observable behavior , alteration believe core feature neuropsychiatric condition anxiety disorder . The investigator establish biomarker-clinical dimension link compare pupillary index human carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) fear provocation test , well subject undergoing transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) prior CO2 administration . Participants recruit Dr. Krystal 's laboratory Duke University proven infrastructure clinical trial . The study team plan enroll total 240 subject healthy volunteer ( age range : 21-65 year ) order complete 100 . This take account expect rate failure : pupillary response auditory oddball task ( AOT ) ( 25 % ) ; sufficient fear response CO2 challenge ( 50 % - relevant last 10 R21 R33 subject ) ; meet screening criterion . R21 Phase : First 30 Subjects undergo two session separate 1 week promising electrode configuration ( three promise configuration test cohort 10 subject ) use tDCS stimulation increase electrical dosage pupillometry carry determine auditory oddball test ( AOT ) response . A maximum 5 total tDCS dosage sham test . Last 10 Subjects . These subject take part double-blind , control , randomize , cross-over study 3 session . At session 1 subject undergo electrical dose titration tDCS electrode configuration result 3 round optimization use procedure first 30 subject determine low well-tolerated dose suppresses AOT pupil response , except maximum 5 tDCS dosage test session . At third fourth session ( 1 week apart ) subject receive dose-optimized tDCS control treatment order randomize along 7.5 % CO2 ( evoke LC response ) 20 minute . The 7.5 % CO2 deliver u pre-mixed provide Airgas . At session , VAS-A State Trait Anxiety-Inventory ( STA-I ) administer 5 minute prior 20 minute session Visual Analog Scale-Anxiety ( VAS-A ) also obtain 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 minute point CO2 inhalation . tDCS administer last 5 minute 20 minute CO2 inhalation period . Subjects monitor hour post-session safety undergo study physician assessment determine suitability leave . Following 2nd treatment session participation end except subject call next day assess adverse effect appropriate care give found . R33 Phase : 60 subject participate double-blind , randomize , control , parallel-group trial . They randomize either active control treatment first post-screening visit undergo electrical dose titration describe treatment randomize . For titration , 5 minute tDCS treatment unblinded member study team contact subject compute AOT pupil response convey tDCS treatment physician whether continue stop titration . Subjects randomized control treatment undergo sham titration stop level randomly select distribution titration outcomes occur R21 phase . Subjects return 1 week undergo optimal dose tDCS control treatment single treatment session describe prior paragraph . Primary outcome VAS-A `` fearful '' rating obtain end tDCS/CO2 inhalation . AOT pupil response obtain every 10 minute end tDCS/CO2 inhalation period map duration persistent effect LC . At end session participation end except subject call next day assess adverse effect care give necessary . Preliminary data R21 phase use provide justification large R33 study , prior commence R33 investigation phase addendum Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) protocol approval obtain . Pupillometry Procedure . The team employ fully mobile SensoMotoric Instruments ( SMI ) Eye-tracking Glasses carry pupillometry . Pupil diameter record continuously eye sample rate 60 Hz via glass subject 's face . The investigator capture pupil size baseline response AOT administration 7.5 % CO2 . Data segment epochs 0 12 relative acquisition onset stimuli experimental condition . An average pupil diameter measure calculate corresponding volume take mean across remain non-artifactual sample epoch . For 7.5 % CO2 response pupil diameter average 1 minute period subject star dark screen dark room . This computed baseline , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 minute start CO2 inhalation 5 minute 30 minute postinhalation . Administration 7.5 % CO2 . Inhalation 7.5 % CO2 20 min carry . Subjects instruct avoid alcohol 36 hour caffeine 12 hour prior test eat light lunch least one hour prior test . A urine pregnancy test administer woman childbearing potential day gas exposure negative result need order continue study participation . Gas deliver via nasal-oral face mask connect via tube 500 L reservoir bag fill 7.5 % CO2/21 % Oxygen ( O2 ) 71.5 % Nitrogen ( N2 ) . Subjects receive air mask 10 min prior CO2 administration baseline measure obtain . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) administer multichannel direct current stimulation device program operator n't know combination electrode use stimulation , , thereby allow double-blinding . The active tDCS electrode configuration use determine 3 round iterative procedure describe ; base electric field model personalized electrical dose titration find low dose well-tolerated engages target term inhibit AOT pupillary response . Electrical dosage personalize subject titrating dosage ( gradually increase ) dosage find well-tolerated ( mild discomfort 5-point Likert scale ) suppress AOT pupillary response . If 5-point Likert tolerability rating great `` mild discomfort '' maximum amperage reach without effect AOT subject participation terminate .</detailed_description>
