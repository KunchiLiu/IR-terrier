However , rise use diagnostic imaging , particularly low-risk patient , may take account risk radiation exposure patient , impact finite health system resource . The objective project improve appropriateness CT image Alberta Emergency Departments advance awareness , adherence , evidence-based guideline CT image patient mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . These two clinical scenario select evidence significant variation imaging practice across Alberta , robust evidence base exist guide CT image decision Canadian CT Head Rule Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Imaging technology rapid diagnosis medical condition indispensable tool emergency department ( ED ) . However , increase inappropriate use costly potentially dangerous image grow healthcare concern . The long-term health risk radiation exposure , resource consume increase use , pose serious threat integrity investigator ' health care system population large . Computed tomography ( CT ) frequently use emergency department set evaluate patient mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) eliminate diagnostic uncertainty either confirm rule serious injury illness . However , test often use lieu alternate safer strategy equivalent accuracy effectiveness . Fortunately , well-validated decision-support tool exist safely identify low risk patient unlikely benefit CT imaging , avoid unnecessary diagnostic imaging radiation exposure , make good use limit health system resource . However , decision-support under-used clinical practice , research optimize uptake yield mixed result . Study Objectives : The investigator conduct cluster-randomized trial evaluate whether implementation decision-support standard clinical practice order CTs ( ) decrease number CTs order , ( b ) increase appropriateness CTs order ( e.g . increase diagnostic yield avoid missed diagnosis ) . Scope : The scope focus two condition validate decision-support exists : MTBI PE . These condition select internal AHS data show significant variability ( 15-90 % ) order CTs patient present condition , validate decision-support exists condition ( e.g . Canadian CT Head Rule , Well 's Score , Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria ) . The scope include hospital Alberta ED in-house CT . There 17 hospital Alberta Fort McMurray Medicine Hat . The investigator obtain operational approval conduct researcher ' study 17 hospital Emergency Chief site , ED Diagnostic Imaging leadership level Zone well Province . The scope limit patient present ED . Methods : The study design cluster randomize trial . In Calgary Zone , investigator randomize half investigator ' ED physician receive decision-support MTBI , half receive decision-support PE . Outside Calgary Zone , investigator randomize site , half site receive decision-support MTBI , half receive decision-support PE . Each half randomization serve control group . The reason investigator randomize physician Calgary Zone Computerized Physician Order Entry system Calgary allow u implement randomization , whereas outside Calgary Zone heterogeneity order entry system make feasible randomize physician , feasible randomize site . The implementation decision-support CT order mandatory support operational clinical leadership . By integrate decision-support exist system order CTs , physician ( site ) randomize MTBI PE decision-support consider tool prior order CT . However , decision-support make decision receive CT ; merely provide additional information likely CT diagnostically useful . All decision regard diagnostic therapeutic intervention sole responsibility physician consultation patient . The primary outcome measure study ( ) percentage MTBI PE patient receive CT scan , ( b ) `` appropriateness '' CT scan order . This last point measure variety way , percentage low-risk patient ( define decision-support ) receive CT , well diagnostic yield CTs order . Procedure : This study support several strategy include integration decision-support CT ordering procedure consultation participate site . This also support voluntary pre-intervention Physician Survey measure knowledge attitude towards CT order decision-support , well perceived barrier implement decision-support practice . Finally , throughout intervention physician sit provide `` audit feedback '' ( clinical informatics ) CT order practice relation peer . This feedback provide exist AHS data system Department Data Integration , Measurement , Reporting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients : All patient present predetermined Alberta emergency department head injury suspect pulmonary embolism target evaluation CT appropriateness . For CT Head , patient &gt; 16 CEDIS Triage code `` Head Injury '' eligible . For CT Pulmonary Angiography ( CTPA ) patient age 1885 CEDIS Triage cod `` Chest Pain ( Noncardiac Features ) '' , `` Shortness Breath '' , `` Syncope/Presyncope '' eligible . Health Professionals : Engagement project fall within professional responsibility mandate many individual support zone leadership domain . The intervention propose educational voluntary nature ; clinical situation clinical judgement expect supersede clinical guideline , therefore coercive measure take impose universal physician compliance . Patients 16 year age CT head , 18 85 year age CT pulmonary angiography .</criteria>
