	<detailed_description>The drug test study call MLN1202 . MLN1202 test treat people diabetes macroalbuminuria . This study look urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio people take MLN1202 . The study enroll approximately 156 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one four treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - MLN1202 75 mg subcutaneous ( SC ) injection - MLN1202 105 mg SC injection - MLN1202 150 mg SC injection - Placebo match MLN1202 SC injection ( dummy inactive solution ) - solution look like study drug active ingredient All participant receive load dose placebo MLN1202 Day 1 follow once-weekly injection study medication randomize receive . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 5 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic , plus final visit 5 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
