	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial compare preference two strategy neuromuscular blocking ( NMB ) / reversal adult obese patient undergo laparoscopic abdominal surgery : Rocuronium + Sugammadex versus Succinylcholine + Cisatracurium + Neostigmine/Atropine . This do evaluating average verbal numerical scale ( VNS ) score obtain surgeon blind drug administer . The primary hypothesis strategy `` Rocuronium + Sugammadex '' provide well surgical visual field obese participant undergo laparoscopic abdominal surgery strategy `` Succinylcholine + Cisatracurium + Neostigmine/Atropine '' measure VNS score .</brief_summary>
