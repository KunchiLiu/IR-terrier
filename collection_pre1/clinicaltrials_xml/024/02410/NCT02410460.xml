	<brief_summary>This study prospective , double-blind , randomized comparison study different anesthesia method rhytidoplasty surgery . The study design determine whether post-operative side-effect profile patient undergo elective cosmetic facelift surgery decrease use propofol/ketamine anesthesia bispectral monitoring ( PKA-BIS ) rather general anesthesia , without increase intra-operative time , side-effect profile , patient recall . Approximately 30 subject undergoing facelift surgery perform principal investigator participate .</brief_summary>
