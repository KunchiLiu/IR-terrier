	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Exoskeleton Hybrid Assistive Limb Conventional Gait Training Early After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare outcome 4 week gait train HAL vs. 4 week conventional gait train part regular inpatient rehabilitation program hemiparetic patient severely limited mobility early stroke . Study design : Randomized , control study blind outcome assessment . Conventional gait training individualize perform accord current practice ( approximately 30-60 minutes/session , 5 day week ) may include stand , weight shifting , step , ground walk assistance and/or assistant device well use treadmill body weight support . Conventional gait training offer study group . Training HAL perform 1 session per day , 4 day per week 4 week . Time session individualise exceed 60 minutes/session ( effective time ) . Training HAL perform combination body-weight support system treadmill . The training program perform 2 physiotherapist , train HAL method .</detailed_description>
