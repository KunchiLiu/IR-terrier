	<brief_title>Bronchial Inflammation Hyperresponsiveness After Oil Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects suffer form exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) usually normal lung function test rest show decrease lung function sport exercise-challenge . In previous study investigator could show , combination exercise test inhalation cold air ist sensitive specific exercise-challenge ambient temperature . It known omega - 3 -fatty acid could reduce production inflammatory mediator . In study investigator investigate protective effect oil supplementation middle-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid exercise-induced asthma provocation model . Therefore investigator measure decrease lung function increase inflammatory marker blood oil supplementation . Before exercise-challenge investigator measure spirometry body plethysmography . The investigator want examine body plethysmography sensitive measurement exercise induce bronchoconstriction spirometry . The investigator hypothesize oil supplementation reduce bronchial inflammation hyperresponsiveness .</detailed_description>
