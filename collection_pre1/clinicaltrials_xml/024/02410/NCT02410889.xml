	<brief_summary>The purpose project develop method combine record electroencephalography ( EEG ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) order improve understanding relationship electrical ( EEG ) blood flow ( fMRI ) responses epileptic discharge necessary step towards clinical use . One factor currently limit use EEG−fMRI patient epilepsy relatively large proportion patient show fMRI response despite epileptic activity detect EEG record scan . The reason unclear , make difficult predict advance whether useful information gain scan session . What epileptic discharge result detectable change fMRI signal , others less obvious frequent ? This question address determine factor responsible occurrence robust fMRI signal change via detailed morphological , topographical spectral analysis EEG signal event event basis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose project continue development new method localising region brain responsible abnormal , epileptic discharge patient epilepsy . The method , EEG−fMRI , combine electroencephalography ( EEG ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . EEG record electrical activity brain via electrode attach scalp , widely use diagnosis study epilepsy . FMRI use MRI scanner detect change blood flow occur whenever region brain active . Both technique wide range application study normal abnormal brain function . The advantage combine two technique fMRI determine accurately location active region , EEG potential unlock relative timing , allow accurate interpretation fMRI result hence brain response epileptic activity . The project apply localisation epileptic seizure , unpredictability , safety implication seizure MRI scanner problem data quality patient move scan . Instead , interictal discharge study , small event occur regularly seizure patient unaware . Clinically , extremely important determine region brain generate epileptic discharge , good understand patient 's epilepsy , suitable case , help planning surgery . EEG−fMRI one method , potentially powerful straightforward patient , require application electrode scalp followed period lie MRI scanner . In addition , since UK hospital MRI scanner EEG expertise , could take advantage capacity already exist within NHS . This project build previous work characterise link electrical ( EEG ) blood flow ( fMRI ) responses interictal discharge necessary order technique become widely use clinically . Patients recruit epilepsy clinic nature purpose project explain . They also receive initial screen MRI safety ensure scan safely . Upon arrival Birmingham University Imaging Centre ( BUIC ) , EEG electrodes attached patient 's scalp use electrode cap . When electrodes place , patient ask lie scanner bed . Ear plugs head phone wear minimise noise scanner prevent communication scanner operator . Once bed move centre scanner , patient ask lie still remainder scan session . No task perform . Scanning include anatomical image multiple run fMRI . The patient alarm bell press time attract attention scanner operator , fMRI scan regular break every 5−6 minute scanner operator talk patient . During course scan patient monitor control room via window video camera . Scanning continue maximum two hour patient express desire terminate session . The patient remove scanner electrode remove , follow patient free leave BUIC . It expect whole procedure take 3 hour conduct per patient , although patient express willingness return may consider . Patients variety type epilepsy scan . This result comprehensive database , take account loss due poor quality data , patient wish leave scanner early interictal discharge observe . The main result study compare property fMRI response corresponding property interictal discharge , order determine discharge detectable fMRI , others . This do patient patient basis , although comparison across patient similar type epilepsy begin help determine patient suitable EEG−fMRI , crucial question technique apply efficiently effectively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. adult contraindication MRI scan . Initial screen MR compatibility perform recruitment . 2. epilepsy interictal epileptic discharge evident scalp EEG . 3. rarity lack seizures . This important point minimise risk patient seizure scan . 4. expected rate interictal epileptic discharge sufficient allow least 10 less 200 event record per hour . Both many event make interpretation EEG−fMRI result difficult . 5. willingness remain scanner minimum 40 minute . This ensure reasonable amount fMRI data collect . It important motivate subject recruit , preferably previously undergone MRI scan idea environment . 1. contraindication MRI scan . 2. epilepsy rare absent interictal discharge , frequent seizure . 3. patient unable give inform consent understand nature study . 4. neurological psychiatric diagnosis epilepsy .</criteria>
