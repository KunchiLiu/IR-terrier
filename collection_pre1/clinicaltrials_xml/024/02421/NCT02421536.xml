	<detailed_description>The propose study evaluate feasibility VibrentTM smartphone application evaluate radiation-induced mucositis pain `` clinic '' 's ability enhance adherence prophylactic pain management algorithm . Successful completion propose study provide foundation upon randomize trial conduct evaluate efficacy prophylactic gabapentin / narcotic various toxicity , patient-reported oncologic outcome patient receive head neck radiotherapy . Moreover , successful establishment pain analgesic approach may future implication pain model plan neuropathic tissue injury . Vibrent Management establish policy procedure regard Privacy Protected Health Information ( PHI ) Security Electronic Protected Health Information ( EPHI ) . This procedure apply applicable Vibrent employee contractor associate management VibrentTM customer 's Protected Health Information . VibrentTM product HIPAA HITECH Act compliant , use high quality process base ISO13485 standard software design development . VibrentTM quality process successfully pass quality audit leader medical device pharmaceutical product . The security , privacy , quality process HIPAA compliance VibrentTM LHS ( Learning Healthcare System ) Cloud host system clear commercial use DoD ( US Army ) provide remote care management service soldier civilian . In addition , secure HIPAA compliant VibrentTM LHS receive SSAE16 certification prove operational control need ensure compliance . The Vibrent LHS security component include security data flight data rest throughout end-to-end system architecture . VibrentTM mobile web application design secure handle information provide store within . All data exchange mobile application web browser website encrypt . Once complete patient consult transmit mobile device server acknowledge receipt , data photo would remove automatically mobile device . Data store mobile application well website secure encrypt . Data exchange internet securely use HTTPS/SSL . The VibrentTM server also securely integrated Johns Hopkins Oncospace® analytic database server allow secure one-way secure transmission `` clinic '' assessment data `` clinic '' Oncospace® analytic database capture treatment-related information include radiotherapy dosimetry information `` clinic '' treatment toxicity oncologic toxicity outcome measure include patient-reported outcome . Integration particularly important radiotherapy dose , volume location upper aerodigestive tract irradiate affect level pain experience radiation-induced mucositis . Oncospace® develop handle continuous data-points dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) summarize radiotherapy deliver specific structure delineate radiotherapy plan series analyzable relational table within database architecture thus facilitate quantification radiotherapy treatment may affect radiation-induced mucositis pain .</detailed_description>
