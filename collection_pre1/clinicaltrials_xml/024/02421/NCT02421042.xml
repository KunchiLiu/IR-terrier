	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , non-randomized , single-dose , sequential-cohort study subject vary degree hepatic impairment , classify accord Child-Pugh system , match normal healthy subject control . The study conduct two phase : Pretreatment Treatment . The Pretreatment Phase two period : Screening Baseline . The study enroll sufficient number subject least 24 subject complete study . This include six subject mild hepatic impairment ( Group 1 ) , six subject moderate hepatic impairment ( Group 2 ) , four six subject severe hepatic impairment ( Group 3 ) , eight subject normal hepatic function ( Group 4 ) . Potential study subject hepatic impairment ( Groups 1 , 2 , 3 ) normal hepatic function ( Group 4 ) first screen study entry . Group 1 , 2 , 3 subject enrol sequentially study first . The Group 4 normal healthy subject enrol follow enrollment hepatic impairment subject . Subjects determine eligible protocol receive either 5- 10-mg single oral dose lenvatinib Day 1 , depend hepatic status . Subjects discharge unit Day 17 ( +/- 2 day ) study discharge procedure complete .</detailed_description>
