	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , non-invasive non-contrast enhance technique , potential improve patient health care management . The overall objective propose project : 1. develop , customize , optimize anatomic functional MRI method , 2. explore use MRI method study CKD evaluate post-transplant kidney , 3. investigate potential MRI diagnosis , prognosis , monitor progression renal dysfunction . In addition direct study kidney , brain MRI study also perform identify cerebrovascular cognitive effect chronic renal function deficiency medical treatment ( e.g . hemodialysis immunosuppression ) . The brain kidney similar vascular bed , susceptible vascular injury , provide pathological basis widely recognize association reduce renal function prevalent cerebrovascular disease ( CVDs ) cognitive impairment ( CI ) . The MRI method brain apply explore origin widely observe CVDs prevalent cognitive impairment ( CI ) kidney disease patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims The overall objective develop validate MRI method evaluation monitor renal status associate cerebrovascular effect renal dysfunction treatment . The propose project include two phase : 1 ) MRI technical development validation reproducibility study ; 2 ) clinical pilot study two patient population ( CKD patient renal transplant recipient ) explore potential MRI evaluate CKD , post-transplantation renal dysfunction cerebrovascular pathophysiology associate induce reduced kidney function renal replacement treatment . The ultimate goal use MRI non-invasive non-contrast enhance tool facilitate diagnosis prognosis renal dysfunction associate disease , ass efficacy therapeutic intervention , monitor disease progress across time . Specific Aim 1 : Imaging technical development protocol optimization renal cerebral MRI . The overall goal develop , customize optimize new MRI method overcome challenge due physiological motion facilitate clinical research study renal cerebral disease , include limited following aspect . Sub-Aim 1.1 : Develop image method improve MRI quality efficiency renal disease study . Sub-Aim 1.2 : Optimize gas-challenge functional MRI protocol study cerebral renal vascular endothelial dysfunction . Sub-Aim 1.3 : Evaluate reproducibility cerebral renal MRI method . Specific Aim 2 : Perform pilot study evaluate potential MRI CKD patient renal transplant recipient . Sub-Aim 2.1 : Evaluate correspondence MRI measure clinical metric ( i.e . eGFR ) routinely assess cognitive function CKD ESRD patient . This accomplished perform cross-sectional longitudinal study , allow u evaluate diagnostic prognostic potential non-invasive imaging method . The investigator hypothesize measurement cerebral and/or renal MRI effectively reflect cerebral and/or renal ( anatomic physiological ) change induce CKD dialysis treatment . Sub-Aim 2.2 : Investigate potential MRI method evaluation post-transplant kidney . This accomplish image transplant recipient three distinct cohort ; good allograft function come routine protocol biopsy , stable renal function , unstable renal function due post-transplant complication . These patient population receive protocol biopsy ( i.e . schedule repeat biopsy ) standard care ; therefore pathologic result available correlation MRI measure . The investigator hypothesize MRI method non-invasive surrogate marker renal tissue property functional change induce renal post-transplant dysfunction ( e.g . renal rejection ) currently obtain biopsy .</detailed_description>
