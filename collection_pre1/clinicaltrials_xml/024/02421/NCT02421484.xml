	<brief_title>Cellular Immunotherapy Septic Shock : A Phase I Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock one common devastate health problem intensive care unit , mortality rate approximately 40 % staggering economic burden approximately 4 billion dollar annually Canada . Mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSCs ) may provide promise new treatment avenue , pre-clinical research show cell modify number pathophysiological process central sepsis greatly reduce rate organ failure death . This dramatic effect appear due ability MSCs modify inflammatory cascade , augment tissue repair enhance pathogen clearance . MSCs evaluate randomized clinical trial include myocardial infarction , heart failure , neurological metabolic disorder , hematological malignancy , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease serious safety concern . However , MSC therapy yet evaluate human septic shock . Prior randomize control trial examine efficacy MSCs septic shock , evaluation safety necessary . The Cellular Immunotherapy Septic Shock ( CISS ) trial open label Phase I dose escalation trial evaluate safety MSC therapy vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
