	<brief_title>RCT Iodine-containing MNPs v Oral Iodized Oil Prevent Iodine Deficiency Weaning Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Universal salt iodization ( USI ) effective mean ensure optimal population iodine status prevent iodine deficiency . In country USI well implement generally assume iodine requirement infant cover breast milk . As infant wean breast milk , age 4-6 month , iodize salt program likely contribute little iodine intake . Home-prepared complementary food low native iodine content pediatric guideline recommend extra salt give infant first year make dietary source iodine limit . Weaning infant may therefore particularly vulnerable iodine deficiency effect . Iodine essential micronutrient integral component thyroid hormone , need normal growth development , particularly brain . Thyroid hormone play critical role development central nervous system early fetal life well birth . Thyroid hormone insufficiency postnatal development associate sensorimotor language deficit hypothyroidism infancy associate poor language , memory skill , fine motor , auditory processing , attention executive processing . In iodine deficient area iodize salt coverage poor , WHO , UNICEF International Council Control Iodine Deficiency Disorders ( ICCIDD ) recommend infant 7 24 month give daily dose 90 µg iodine ( potassium iodate ) annual dose 200 mg iodine ( iodised oil ) . The scientific evidence recommendation weak , however , uncertain condition two prevention strategy may apply two best . The objective study evaluate efficacy safety two recommended intervention strategy iodine-deficient weaning infant . The need high-quality control study well understand potential contribution synergy alternative strategy help achieve optimal iodine nutrition different population group setting recently define major research priority . Following cross-sectional , pilot study , conduct randomize controlled trial ass efficacy two daily dos iodine potassium iodate ( 90 µg , 100 % WHO recommend dose , 45 µg , 50 % WHO recommend dose ) annual dose 200 mg iodine iodise oil , via randomize , control trial wean infant lactate mother live area affect mild moderate iodine deficiency Zamboanga del Norte , Philippines , Southeast Asia . We compare efficacy iodine dos , micro-nutrients give alone , estimate optimal level iodine inclusion MNPs , report safety intervention wean infant . This study provide important guidance public health expert , government international organisation ensure normal infant thyroid function growth development .</detailed_description>
