	<brief_title>A Comparative Trial Improving Care Underserved Asian Americans Infected With HBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Asian Americans high rate chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection ( CHB ) United States . They suffer liver disease cirrhosis liver cancer . Those CHB often report feel well even though high risk complication . Because high incidence prevalence CHB , patient high risk need test every 6 12 month early sign liver problem . Objectives : This study answer critical question Asian Americans CHB improve timely test . The primary aim compare patient Patient Navigator plus Mobile Phone Text Messaging Intervention ( PNMI ) receive standard care . The secondary aim compare PNMI standard-care patient knowledge CHB , cop skill , social support , find benefit , quality life , anxiety . The exploratory aim compare PNMI standard-care patient ' satisfaction PNMI . We plan answer question , `` For infected HBV , patient-centered PNMI intervention effective increase patient adherence monitoring test standard care ? '' Methods : Asian Americans Philadelphia New York HBV age 18 old participate . Using randomization process , 500 patient receive either PMNI standard care . At patient ' entry study , 6 month , 12 month , information collect : 1. follow HBV test monitoring guideline , 2. know HBV care management , 3. quality life , 4. social support , 5. cop skill , 6. anxiety level , 7. patient satisfaction . Patient navigator represent Asian culture receive thorough , two-day HBV training . PNMI patient receive three education session text message mobile phone . Patients , patient advocate , physician , Center Asian Health ( CAH ) staff active study partner . Patient Outcomes : We expect find good health outcome low HBV health gap , measure number patient : 1. get doctor-recommended test care every 6 12 month ; 2. get doctor-recommended HBV care ; 3. HBV knowledge , good quality life , social support , cop skill ; 4. few barrier less anxiety . With regular testing , cancer find earlier treat successfully , lead long life . Patient Stakeholder Engagement : Fourteen year community-based participatory research make CAH staff , patient , patient advocate , doctor good partner create test PNMI intervention . Partners tell community , doctor , scientist study finding . Anticipated Impact : Asian American 's high rate HBV liver cancer large health gap compare white Americans . This study may reduce gap . If patient part PNMI intervention well standard care , PNMI may become widely used CHB patient United States world .</detailed_description>
