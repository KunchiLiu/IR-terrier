	<brief_title>Phase II Trial TIL Following CCRT Patients With Locoregionally Advanced NPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) endemic Southern China Southeast Asia . For locoregionally advanced NPC , especially high risk NPC ( EB virus DNA ≥ 4000 copies/ml ) , incidence treatment failure still high . Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) improve treatment outcome patient , approximately 25 % locoregionally advanced NPCs relapse . Adjuvant chemotherapy induce chemotherapy addition CCRT significantly improve patient survival compare CCRT alone . Hence , urgent need novel therapy improve disease-free survival reduce treatment-related toxicity patient . Accumulating evidence show tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) select tumor recognition greatly expand vitro especially effective treat cancer patients.The investigation phase I result show TILs follow CCRT novel treatment strategy locoregionally advanced NPC patient result sustained anti-tumor activity anti-EBV immune response , associate good tolerance . This Phase II trial study effectiveness security cisplatin CCRT plus TIL versus cisplatin CCRT IMRT treat patient locoregionally advanced high risk NPC .</detailed_description>
