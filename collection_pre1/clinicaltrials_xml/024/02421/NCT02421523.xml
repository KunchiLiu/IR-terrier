	<brief_summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) debilitate neuromuscular disease cause muscle breakdown , weakness , eventual death . Over last 40 year parent receive little guidance potential exercise therapeutic strategy maintain muscle function . It well know high intensity exercise eccentric contraction result muscle damage dystrophic muscle , yet absence muscle load conversely result muscle wasting . Recent research rodent model milder form muscular dystrophy support earlier study resistance exercise may beneficial effect maintenance muscle mass dystrophic muscle . However , careful systematic investigation safety feasibility resistance exercise need consider implementation boy DMD . The goal project assess safety feasibility home base mild moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program boys Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) . Evidence milder form muscular dystrophy mouse model DMD suggest strengthen exercise may beneficial child , area adequately explore use human subject . The result study provide information assist development scientifically base recommendation concern optimal exercise parameter patient DMD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective pilot study ass whether mild moderate-intensity strengthen exercise program safely implement boy DMD . In Aim 1 , investigator determine dose response safety mild moderate-intensity isometric resistance exercise child DMD . Twelve ambulatory boy DMD participate isometric exercise dose protocol , load progressively increase . In early proof concept pilot study , two large muscle group study : knee extensor knee flexor . T2 weight magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) thigh muscle use monitor evidence muscle damage intensity level determine safe exercise range . Other safety measure include verbal pain rating scale , clinical examination , serum creatine kinase ( CK ) level . In Aim 2 , investigator implement pilot intervention study examine feasibility safety 12 week in-home isometric strengthen program child DMD . In study , 20 boy DMD randomize either exercise group control group . Ten boys DMD randomize exercise group complete progressive exercise program use parameter dose identify Aim 1 . Assessment strength safety perform regular time interval throughout study . Ten boys DMD randomized participate exercise intervention test similar time interval serve control . The data pilot study serve perform power analysis need design appropriately powered clinical intervention study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis DMD confirm 1. clinical history feature age five 2. physical examination 3. elevate serum creatine kinase level 4. absence dystrophin expression , determine immunostain Western blot ( &lt; 2 % ) and/or DNA confirmation dystrophin mutation . Age 7 9 year : low age limit 7 year select , since experience child young 7 year likely unable cooperate comply exercise measure need . An upper age limit 9 year set boys DMD tend reach rapid progression late ambulatory phase soon age . Ambulatory time first visit , define ability walk least 100 without external assistive device able climb four stair . Currently use corticosteroid ( prednisone deflazacort ) prescribe physician . Contraindication MR examination ( e.g . aneurysm clip , severe claustrophobia , magnetic implant ) Presence condition control subject secondary condition boy DMD impact muscle function muscle metabolism ( e.g . myasthenia gravis , endocrine disorder , mitochondrial disease ) Secondary condition lead developmental delay impaired motor control ( e.g . cerebral palsy ) Secondary condition impact muscle function muscle metabolism ( e.g . myasthenia gravis , endocrine disorder , mitochondrial disease ) Unstable medical condition ( e.g . uncontrolled seizure disorder ) Behavioral problem cause inability cooperate testing</criteria>
