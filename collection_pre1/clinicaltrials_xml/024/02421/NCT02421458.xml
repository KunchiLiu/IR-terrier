	<brief_title>Comparing Two Palliative Schemes Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial proportion patient head neck ( HNC ) suitable curative treatment surgery and/or ( chemo ) radiotherapy ( CRT ) advance stage , significant comorbidities , bad general condition , distant metastasis , combination factor . Although radiotherapy ( RT ) commonly use option achieve durable disease control alleviate troublesome symptom , data optimal radiation scheme impact schedule quality life ( QoL ) vulnerable patient extremely scarce . Although different radiation scheme use worldwide ( Netherlands , least 15 different radiation schedule use ) , currently possible identify best RT scheme , base retrospective study major difference study regard patient 's demographic , radiation schedule give , radiation technique use etc . Furthermore , information available impact scheme treatment-related toxicity QoL . This illustrate urgent need multicenter randomize control trial ( RCT ) identify optimal scheme RT group patient . Therefore , investigator intend initiate prospective RCT comparing survival , loco-regional control , toxicity , QoL two commonly use schemes . This study first kind palliative patient HNC compare short-course ( 6 fraction ) long-course radiotherapy ( 16 fraction ) . Because patient incurable HNC poor performance status major comorbidity prefer limited number visit hospital , quite reasonable investigate whether short scheme radiotherapy limit number visit clinic good relatively long-course radiotherapy term outcome , toxicity QoL . This delicate balance outcome , possible toxicity patient 's comfort would justify initiation randomize trial . The result study nearby future enable u indicate radiation scheme best suit patient category</detailed_description>
