	<brief_summary>The radial ulnar artery injury relate wrist cut frequently encounter . There many factor effective improvement arterial structure repair microsurgical technique . Recently begin focus neointimal thicken endothelialization role vascular heal maturation make histopathological study . In study , radial ulnar artery laceration repair heal microsurgical anastomosis method blood CD34 , CD133 CD309 level effect distribution lymphoid cell investigate . The investigator think ; thus demonstrate positive impact may arise ; autologous endothelial progenitor cell obtain patient ; continuation anastomotic patency undergo coronary by-pass hemodialysis patient arteriovenous fistula ; also ensure re-flow patient acute chronic peripheral arterial occlusion . The investigator believe could use reimplanted tissue limb breakage ensure survive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The radial ulnar artery cut need urgently repair use microsurgical technique ; treatment failure rate quite high among injured . When straight cut repair microsurgical instrument microscope cut properly ; obtain close excellent result . However , many factor impact arterial healing . Hypertension , hypotension , age , diabetes mellitus , obesity female gender negative effect vascular healing . In recent year , positive effect endothelialization begin focus improvement ; show endothelialization hematopoietic stem cell endothelial progenitor cell CD34 CD133 cd309 effective . CD34 type 1 transmembrane protein know stem cell marker . Proliferative cell endothelial stem cell play important role still heal process vascular incision . These include CD133 ( haematopoietic progenitor cell ) CD309 ( Vasculoendotelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 ) also believe effective . These stem cell proliferate endothelial cell call collectively endothelial proliferative cell ( EPC ) . Griese et al study do rabbit ; autologous endothelial cell , obtain peripheral blood immunohistochemical method , transplant carotid artery intimal injury experimentally.The EPC-treated group observe increase endothelialization significantly reduce neointimal hyperplasia , compare control group . Kawamoto et al study ex vivo ; endothelial progenitor cell myocardial ischemic group , show positive impact preservation leave ventricular function . In another clinical study patient peripheral arterial disease ischemic limb ; increase oxygen carried extremity study group , decrease rest pain , increase walk distance increase ankle-brachial index . In investigator study vessel laceration , CD 34 , CD133 CD309 endothelial progenitor cell stem cell blood level show whether effect vascular healing . Results obtain ; frequently encounter relatively high treatment cost lead loss also great labor ; myocardial infarction , peripheral arterial disease , ensure fistula open chronic dialysis patient , provision limb preservation vitality limb replantation open new horizon .</detailed_description>
