	<brief_summary>Hypertension affect 30 % United Kingdom population causally implicated aetiology renal disease , cardiovascular disease stroke . Ageing , obesity , poor diet low level physical activity risk factor . Studies show adherence Mediterranean diet protective hypertension associate morbidity ; olive oil believe key beneficially bioactive component diet . As source lipid olive oil unremarkable blend monounsaturated , polyunsaturated saturate fatty acid ; however rich phenolic compound , principally oleuropein hydroxytyrosol , may benefit health . A recent randomise intervention trial predominantly hypertensive volunteer show adherence Mediterranean diet supplement extra virgin olive oil , reduce blood pressure measure cardiovascular disease risk . Olive phenolic extract cheaply waste product olive oil manufacture , plant leaf use dietary supplement . In intervention study hypertensive borderline hypertensive patient , olive leaf extract consumption show reduce blood pressure . Another intervention establish efficacy improve blood pressure increase physical activity . The 'Start Active , Stay Active ' , Chief Medical Officers report physical activity recommend adult achieve 150 minute moderate intensity physical activity per week , data report suggest few 40 % adult men 30 % adult woman achieve target . Adherence physical activity guideline may fact much bad sub-sections population high risk hypertension . From public health perspective , holistic guideline prevention hypertension , early diagnosis management , base around healthy diet lifestyle preferable pharmaceutical intervention . Lifestyle intervention economically favourable come few side effect perhaps wider health benefit antihypertensive drug . The aim study evidence synergistic benefit consume plant ( specifically olive ) phenolic alongside achieve recommend guideline physical activity individual elevate blood pressure .</brief_summary>
