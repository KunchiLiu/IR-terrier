	<brief_title>Study Nivolumab Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive nivolumab vein 60 minute , every 2 week ( +/- 2 day ) . After 8 dos ( 4 cycle ) , nivolumab give every 12 week . Study Visits : Each cycle 28 day . On Days 1 , 7 , 14 Cycle 1 ; Days 1 14 Cycles 2-4 ; Day 1 Cycle 5 Day 1 every third cycle ( Cycles 8 , 11 , 14 , ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon time ) drawn routine test . Some blood sample may also used test pancreatic function blood sugar level . - You complete questionnaire quality life . Before dose study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system . On Day 1 Cycles 3 5 , every 3 cycle ( Cycles 8 , 11 , 14 ) , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test , become pregnant On Day 1 Cycle 5 , every 3 cycle ( Cycles 8 , 11 , 14 , ) doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy check status disease cytogenetic genetic testing . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug 4 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish receiving study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system . Follow-Up : About 30 , 60 , 100 day last dose study drug , receive another treatment MF , member study staff call ask side effect may . This call last 10 minute . If become pregnant , need return clinic 30 100 day last dose study drug pregnancy test . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA-approved commercially available treatment certain kind melanoma . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment MF . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
