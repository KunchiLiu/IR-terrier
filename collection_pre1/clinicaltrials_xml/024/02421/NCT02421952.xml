	<detailed_description>Pediatric research management nausea limit absence reliable method quantify intensity subjective symptom . In adult , visual analog scale ( VAS ) accurate tool , show reliable young child . By default common objective outcome measure use pediatric study incidence number emetic episode . This measure , however , correlate poorly somatic subjective symptom nausea . Apfel et al show 30-40 % adult patient undergo surgery post discharge nausea / vomit 12 % vomiting . These data nausea adult base visual analog scale nausea . There data incidence postoperative nausea child since severity symptom difficult measure young child know unable use VAS reliably . Recently pictorial scale measure nausea , Baxter Animated Retching Faces ( BARF ) scale , develop show construct , content convergent validity instrument measure nausea child . The clinical usefulness scale determine incidence postoperative post-discharge nausea child yet determine include low age use reliably , score associated patient 's perception need treatment , minimum change score clinical relevance test-retest reliability nausea rat change .</detailed_description>
