	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Efficacy GR-MD-02 Treatment Liver Fibrosis Patients With NASH With Advanced Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine difference placebo GR-MD-02 treatment baseline adjust mean change liver fibrosis measure correct T1 ( cT1 ) mapping determine LiverMultiScan ( LMS ) , multi-parametric MRI protocol . Secondary objective include evaluate difference subject treat GR-MD-02 versus placebo : - The baseline-adjusted change liver stiffness measure MR-elastography - The baseline-adjusted change liver stiffness measure FibroScan® score . An exploratory objective evaluate correlation three diagnostic modality LiverMultiScan , MR-Elastography , FibroScan® .</detailed_description>
