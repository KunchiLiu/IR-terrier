	<brief_title>Treatment Back Pain Using Transcutaneous Magnetic Stimulation ( TCMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one third Americans suffer acute chronic pain pain call silent epidemic . Treatment pain often involve opiod medication significant potential abuse , addiction adverse reaction respiratory depression death . Magnetic brain stimulation use treatment pain . There report use phantom-limb pain treatment central peripheral pain syndrome . The study evaluate whether experimental medical device ( Fischell TCMS Pain Treatment Device ) emit pulse brief , intense magnetic field relieve pain low back . Transcutaneous Magnetic Stimulation ( TCMS ) name method deliver magnetic pulse skin . TCMS approve FDA peripheral nerve stimulation , treatment migraine headache depression type device study scientifically treatment back pain . No significant adverse reaction side effect report use magnetic stimulation headache treatment . Some patient migraine headache excellent pain relief magnetic treatment even get pain relief medication . Other patient headache relief magnetic treatment . The current use TCMS apply head require special equipment multiple treatment session . TCMS apply peripherally easy , may require few treatment session achieve pain relief . Non-invasive treatment pain would represent significant advance field especially use successfully treat pain result reduction elimination need opioid medication . The investigator know whether magnetic treatment relieve back pain investigator test apply powerful electromagnet area back pain . In patient , magnet turn , patient magnet turn . Neither patient patient 's treat doctor know whether magnet turn , although study team know patient receive treatment magnetic pulse . The effect pain record periodically 2 day . If patient ' report pain reduced magnet turn compare patient ' magnet turn , magnet may reduce pain . Additional study patient needed sure magnet therapy reduce low back pain .</detailed_description>
