Autophagy process cell break part stay alive time stress , starvation . This may allow cancer cell survive damage chemotherapy . Hydroxychloroquine may block process happening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Blocking Autophagy Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect different dos hydroxychloroquine marker autophagy prostate tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine distribution autophagic activity within prostate cancer tissue . II . To determine utility beclin-1 marker autophagic activity . III . To assess marker apoptosis tumor tissue . IV . To perform deep-sequencing prostate tissue obtain time surgery . V. To assess prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) biochemical endpoint clinical activity . VI . To determine number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) pre- post-treatment blood sample . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group . GROUP I ( PLANNING PROSTATECTOMY ) : Patients Group I randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 14 day undergo prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients receive high dose hydroxychloroquine PO thrice daily ( TID ) 14 day undergo prostatectomy . GROUP II ( ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE ) : Patients receive hydroxychloroquine PO QD . Treatment continue begin local therapy 1 year .</detailed_description>
