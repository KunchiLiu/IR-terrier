	<brief_summary>Over one-third child adolescent overweight nearly 1 5 obese . Metabolic syndrome , strong predictor Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , occur 44 % obese youth , foreshadow great prevalence earlier onset T2D . Without effective intervention , `` diabesity '' worsen , T2D prevalence increase , adults face consequence young age . Given strong association obesity chronic disease risk factor youth , investigator contend T2D prevention ( CVD prevention ) akin weight control obesity prevention . The objective propose project develop family-centered , community-based program T2D prevention peripubertal ( 9- 12-year-old ) youth . Using participatory method , investigator intend adapt successful adult-focused YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program ( YDPP ) youth family assess feasibility , participant acceptance adherence YFDPP use two delivery format : 12-week YMCA-based face-to-face program 12-week combined face-to-face plus mobile device-based program . The propose study test investigator premise delivery technology reduce participant perceive burden , improve adherence , lead improve anthropometric ( height , weight BMI waist circumference ) , behavioral ( diet physical activity ) physiological outcome ( fast insulin , glucose , lipid , blood pressure ) . The investigator use result data design appropriately power full-scale trial . The importance propose study underscored statistic cite recent call proposal translate efficacious clinical intervention effective community program youth . The potential impact propose intervention great program deliver paraprofessional community without university researcher ; significant target major public health challenge child include assessment objective behavioral clinical data ; innovative focus at-risk population , take place popular , accessible community venue , use mobile technology extend reach increase engagement youth family intervention content . The long-term goal create scalable , replicable , sustainable program overcomes exist barrier implementation dissemination evidence-based , research-proven diabetes prevention program youth family , thereby improve population health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator objective develop family-centered , community-based program T2D prevention peripubertal ( 9-12-year-old ) youth . Efficacious community program youth available ( although promising component exist ) , thus investigator propose adapt successful adult-focused YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program ( YDPP ) youth family , assess impact anthropometric , behavioral physiological outcome support design ( power calculation ) full-scale trial . The propose study evaluate adapt program use two format ( without mobile technology ) . Secondary endpoint include participant perceived burden , adherence , program cost . Aim 1 : Adapt efficacious diabetes prevention program adult ( YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program , YDPP ) delivery overweight peripubertal youth family , thereby establish YMCA Family Diabetes Prevention Program ( YFDPP ) . Aim 2 : Test feasibility , participant acceptance ( child parent ) retention rate YFDPP use two format , 12-week YMCA-based face-to-face program 12-week program content deliver combination face-to-face mobile device . Aim 3 : Test impact new YFDPP use two format anthropometric ( height , weight , BMI waist circumference ) , behavioral ( diet physical activity ) , physiological ( fast insulin , glucose , lipid ) outcome , use result data design appropriately power full-scale trial .</detailed_description>
