	<brief_summary>Recent study show bacteria within gut play important role diabetes improvement bariatric ( weight-loss ) surgery . Bariatric surgery fundamentally change environment within gut , result change makeup trillion bacteria live within . These change gut bacteria affect body number complex way , begin understand . For example , gut bacteria breakdown food unable absorb , lead alter sugar level release molecule act reduce appetite . In study aim find bariatric surgery change gut bacteria lead weight loss improvement diabetes . With understanding hope discover potential target future treatment , identify beneficial bacteria could supplement probiotic patient . Additionally , although highly successful , 30 % obese patient undergo improvement diabetes bariatric surgery . We aim identify molecule within patient 's blood urine able predict likely chance patient undergo improvement diabetes bariatric surgery help clinician select patient likely benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Phenotyping Bariatric Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study aim ass gut microbiome affect host phenotype follow bariatric surgery alter gut microbiome-host co-metabolism . The secondary objective identify novel biomarkers preoperative prognostication T2DM remission follow bariatric surgery . We longitudinally phenotype 130 obese diabetic undergo Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery . Patients assess preoperatively 3 month 1 year postoperatively . The primary clinical outcome diabetes remission . Other clinical measure record include ; 1 ) anthropometric &amp; physiological measurement , 2 ) demographic detail , 3 ) biochemical parameter , 4 ) anti-hyperglycaemic medication use , 5 ) co-morbidity status 6 ) dietary choice 24hr dietary recall questionnaire . Blood , urine stool sample collect time point . Changes microbiome assess use 16S rRNA sequence qPCR . Selected responder non-responders undergo full shotgun metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis . Global metabonomic profile serum , urine faecal water generate use 1H-NMR . Further targeted analysis bile acid short-chain fatty acid profile perform use LC-MS / GC-MS. We utilise multivariate statistical analysis technique identify metabolic pathway alter follow intervention , novel host-microbiome co-metabolism pathway impact upon phenotype . A supervised multivariate analysis , map T2DM outcome metagenomic metabonomic data perform aim identify novel preoperative biomarkers able prognosticate T2DM resolution follow bariatric surgery .</detailed_description>
