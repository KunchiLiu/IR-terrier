	<brief_title>The Effect Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Human Brains : A Neuroimaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This placebo condition control double blind randomize prospective study study team plan acquire clinical , neurocognitive imaging data schizophrenia patient healthy control . The propose schedule show Figure 1 . Those eligible study consent , randomize either group A B . The length study four week . Subjects group undergo procedure , except subject group A unbeknownst receive sham stimulation tDCS ( placebo condition ) , subject group B receive real tDCS stimulation . Real tDCS stimulation involve ten 20 minute stimulation daily ( 2 mA anode leave DLPFC cathode right suborbital region ) 5 weekday two consecutive week , sham contain 20 minute session well , first minute 2mA , unbeknownst subject , unblinded research assistant turn stimulation . The subject tell give either sham real stimulation ask end experiment fill visual analog scale indicate guess real sham arm . Following first two week study , follow period two week stimulation sham administer . Subjects , raters , clinician research person keep blind regard placebo stimulation status end study . Research person analyze neuroimgaing data break blindness subject leave study , continuously monitor neuroimaging finding .</detailed_description>
