	<brief_summary>Each year Medicare spend approximately $ 31.3 billion 2.4 million skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) episodes care . SNFs rely interdisciplinary approach patient care maximize rehabilitation potential return prior level function reduce risk adverse event old adult . However despite substantial increase spending SNF service minimal change complexity caseload , 68 % patient pre-hospitalization level function discharge , 25 % return community , 18 % hospitalize . This may partially explain current SNF approach patient care foster inactivity participation low intensity rehabilitation intervention ( preliminary data ) . Both inactivity low-intensity intervention may perpetuate functional decline impede maximal recovery . The serious implication risk functional decline exemplify study show decline physical function increase risk re-hospitalized six-fold may infer long term effect increase risk mortality , morbidity , institutionalization . Muscle weakness , reduce cardiorespiratory reserve , neuromuscular deficit attribute acute decline function . However current rehabilitation strategy SNFs promote adequate dose mode intervention induce beneficial systemic adaptation , perhaps due lack evidence effective rehabilitation protocols medically-complex population . Therefore , investigator design rehabilitation program , uniquely integrate principle physiologic tissue overload strengthen functional intervention great gain physical function . Data collect first cohort patient cycle SNF Stage 1 , usual care occur ( 5 month ) . Then , staff training progressive rehabilitation intervention occur 2 month . Finally , data collect second cohort patient cycle SNF Stage 2 , progressive rehabilitation implement SNF staff ( 5 month ) . Given high turnover patient SNFs ( average length stay ~21 day ) , 2 different cohort patient study analysis consist independent 2-sample t-tests . During Stage 1 2 , measure physical function assess eligible patient admission discharge SNF . Therapists assess adherence protocol documentation audit use on-site observational checklist . Acceptability intervention patient assess patient satisfaction survey . Any adverse event obtain medical record document . The discharge location patient document .</brief_summary>
