	<brief_summary>This study extension study ( prospective observational study ) 'IDEAL ' study ( A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Imatinib ( Glinib ) 600mg/day depend Early Molecular Response Newly Diagnosed Patients Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase , NCT02204722 ) evaluate duration treatment response , disease progression , survival status 5 year inclusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study IDEAL ( Imatinib ) Chronic Myelgenous Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We start prospective study evaluate efficacy safety imatinib 600mg/day depend early molecular response newly diagnose patient chronic myelogenous leukemia chronic phase ( IDEAL , NCT02204722 ) , enroll 150 patient follow 1 year purpose evaluate primary endpoint - difference major molecular response rate 1 year . However , Chronic myelogenous disease need long-term outcome treatment BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor . After end follow-up period IDEAL study , subject agree extension study ( IDEAL-E ) enrol follow additional 4 year evaluate duration treatment response , disease progression , survival status . Subjects enrol prospective observational study treat drug - imatinib 300-600mg / nilotinib 600mg / dasatinib 100mg - chosen investigator accord drug compliance overall response . The drug choice discretion investigator , overall adverse event / molecular response monitor every 6 month prospective observational study .</detailed_description>
