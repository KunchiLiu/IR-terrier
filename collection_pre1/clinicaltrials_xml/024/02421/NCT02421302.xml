GAP : Clinicians note certain patient deteriorate start ART nutritional supplementation despite viralogical suppression immunological improvement paradoxical emergence certain opportunistic infection , electrolyte derangement malnutrition hence IRIS re-feeding syndrome ( RF ) . There paucity data nutrition determinant immune pharmacological response amongst HIV infect malnourished child despite malnutrition common . HYPOTHESIS : Well-nourished HIV infect child ART naïve experience good nutritional , clinical , immunological pharmacological outcome malnourish child ART naïve experience . METHODS : A cohort design study 75 malnourished HIV infect child ART RUTF compare 75 well-nourished child ART naive experience age 6 month 12 year primary carers provide informed consent enrol study follow 12 week . IMPACT : This study endeavor provide appropriate information enhance management malnourish HIV infect child context ART RUTF impact immune response drug metabolism .
