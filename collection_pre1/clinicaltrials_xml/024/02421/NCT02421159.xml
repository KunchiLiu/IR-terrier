	<detailed_description>The Brooklyn Community United ( BCU ) study supplement main research study seek , test , treat retain heterosexual high risk HIV . The main research study entitle `` Peer Driven Intervention Seek , Test , &amp; Treat Heterosexuals High Risk HIV . '' The main study 's field name Brooklyn Community Action Project BCAP ( R01DA032083 , R # : 11-01257 ) . The main study test two approach seek undiagnosed HIV infection ( Venue-based Sampling Confidential Two-Session Testing Navigation ) . We study HHR New York City part CDC 's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance ( NHBS ) study . Building NHBS work , currently third year main study ( R01DA032083 , R # : 11-01257 ) , primary aim compare efficacy peer-driven intervention use respondent-driven sample strategy ( `` RDS-CTTN '' ) venue-based sampling ( VBS ) respect identify previously undiagnosed HIV infection . The main study locate central Brooklyn , high-risk area ( HRA ) elevate rate poverty , high heterosexual HIV prevalence , generalize HIV epidemic may say exist . To date , RDS-CTTN VBS enrol approximately 45 % sample ( RDS-CTTN 1338/3000 ; VBS 174/400 ) . Participants sample evidence high rate risk factor ( substance use , incarceration , homelessness , unemployment ) . As hypothesize , PDI/RDS reach population high rate risk factor , low rate HIV test compare VBS . Almost RDS-CTTN VBS test least previously ( &gt; 86 % ) , few half test past year . Among lifetime testing , data suggest test infrequent median 2.5 test per ten year adulthood . Interestingly , almost enroll RDS-CTTN VBS elect test HIV ( &gt; 90 % ) , difference HIV test acceptance rate test previously first-time tester . This suggest enroll study , although know barrier HIV test range risk factor adverse outcome , open confidential HIV testing . These finding support promise RDS-CTTN approach , preliminary study also signal need reach great fear barrier HIV test engage confidential testing . With approximately 45 % sample enrol , HIV prevalence RDS-CTTN sample 3.45 % ( 37/1071 ) ; 35.14 % newly diagnose ( 13/37 ) . Rates newly diagnose HIV infection may continue increase recruitment chain reach deep hidden vulnerable component network . In VBS , 1.89 % newly diagnose HIV ( 3/159 ) . Yet HIV prevalence rate low find two previous heterosexual cycle NHBS local area : 7 % HET1 12.3 % HET2 spur interest additional innovative strategy seek undiagnosed HIV . Despite high acceptability among enrolled participant preliminary evidence efficacy , two-session RDS-CTTN approach may less successful enrolling HRA would decline confidential HIV test formal setting poor access test . The RDS-CTTN intervention may optimal reach great psychosocial barrier regular HIV testing , may number reason high rate undiagnosed HIV , individual , particularly woman , multiple job family responsibility may time two-session intervention . ( Indeed woman under-represented RDS-CTTN [ ~ 40 % ] VBS [ ~30 % ] . ) It possible test participant HIV first encounter , aswe VBS study do . In supplement study , build lesson learn themain study progress literature address concern . Anonymous test available state local health department , case occupational exposure , home test/self-test technology , research study include local NHBS study HHR . There evidence suggest individual test anonymously early course HIV disease engage confidential testing . Additionally , anonymous testing may useful and/or preferred individual marginalize population . As Kegeles colleague find , many seek anonymous HIV-antibody test would avoid circumstance , anonymous testing may prefer among suspect infect , bisexual individual , fear stigma discrimination . Thus , brief , anonymous HIV test effort may appeal engage HHR face barrier confidential HIV testing . While anonymous test may effective and/or efficient strategy 'seek ' phase STTR , majority study test program address vital step linkage care . Although anonymous test tends yield individual earlier HIV disease , test anonymously likely experience delay enter care , anonymous test site program typically resource engage individual linkage program co-located medical care . For example , study characteristic HIV test encounter linkage care , Reed ( 2009 ) find 36 % test anonymously enter care within three month diagnosis , compare 26 % test confidentially . The supplement study hypothesis : ( H1 ) : Compared VBS RDS-CTTN , control potential difference key socio-demographic characteristic across sample , RDS-ASTN participant less HIV test experience . ( H2 ) Controlling potential difference key socio-demographic characteristic across sample , RDS-ASTN yield high rate previously undiagnosed HIV compare VBS RDS-CTTN . ( H3 ) : Most participant ( &gt; 70 % ) find HIV-infected RDS-ASTN intervention engage Treat Retain intervention phase . ( H4 ) : Most participant Treat Retain phase RDS-ASTN intervention ( &gt; 70 % ) , HIV infect , link care within 3 month .</detailed_description>
