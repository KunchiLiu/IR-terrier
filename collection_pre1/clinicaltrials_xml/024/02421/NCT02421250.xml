	<brief_summary>The study clinical trial determine whether efficient medical operational outcome achieve use new SpHb monitoring triage emergency room setting . The investigator also evaluate accuracy measurement SpHb device Maximo versus gold standard central hospital laboratory value . In addition , investigator assess patient satisfaction tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A major issue face emergency department world overcrowding , result limited resource ( i.e . staff , space , equipment ) attend large patient exceed physical and/or staff capacity ED . To manage issue overcrowd , system triage create help prioritize patient 's case , base set criterion determine time treatment and/or treatment indicate . Our study contribute discovery efficient way triaging patient base objective subjective criterion decision-making treatment disposition , simultaneously maintain patient safety . The investigator achieve aim evaluate efficiency noninvasive continuous total hemoglobin ( SpHb ) monitor provide Masimo Corporation ( Irvine USA ) . Standard hemoglobin measurement via central laboratory test invasive , painful , time-consuming , increased lag time analysis , potentially expose health care worker blood-borne illness , delay treatment onset require direct blood sampling . The new SpHb monitor potentially offer new way evaluate objective criterion patient maximize treatment outcome appropriate disposition . The SpHb monitor potential trend hemoglobin monitoring , quicken detection acute anemia , avoid complication , anxiety , expense , patient discomfort associate invasive blood draw . In ED setting , need efficiently triage patient designate disposition appropriate treatment management outcomes . Hemoglobin level accurate indicator help distinguish patient need early blood transfusion meet criterion admission . Noninvasive technology , SpHb device Masimo , assist common goal emergency medicine : efficiently accurately decrease wait time treatment disposition , screen patient difficult venous access , provide repeat sample without cause iatrogenic blood loss link anemia , offer approach may use develop organize coherent therapeutic plan base physiologic criterion emergency patient he/she proceeds ED OR , hospital general floor , ICU . This study perform University Chicago Medical Center main adult emergency room . Patients examine enrolled study initially triage nurse person give his/her write informed consent . Randomization process carry base day week . Patients enrol one group every two day . For example , start week begin trial , assign Monday patient control group , Tuesday patient experimental group , Wednesday patient control group… Two group similar characteristic . Depending whether subject randomize control experimental group , use use SpHb monitor obtain measurement . To obtain measurement , place probe device patient 's finger record hemoglobin level determine Masimo Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter . We collect patient satisfaction data 2 minute placement SpHb device 2 minute blood sample . The collection blood consider standard care . Along record hemoglobin measurement , record triage chief complaint , final physician diagnosis , time blood product transfusion , time disposition ( i.e . discharge home Hospital admission via intensive care unit general floor ) , time procedure ( i.e . procedure via operating room , endoscopy interventional gastroenterology , interventional pulmonology , ENT , interventional radiology ) , hemodynamics ( i.e . blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation , respiratory rate ) .</detailed_description>
