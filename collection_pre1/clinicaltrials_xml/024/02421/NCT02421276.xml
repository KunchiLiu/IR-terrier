	<brief_summary>This study plan learn Down syndrome . The investigator think different level AIRE gene individual Down syndrome . The investigator think AIRE gene level provide insight depress immune cell function individual Down syndrome . Patients ask research study investigator want see blood contains less AIRE gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depressed AIRE Gene Expression Causes Immune Cell Dysfunction &amp; Autoimmunity Down Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Down Syndrome ( DS ) common chromosomal abnormality among live-born infant . Through full partial trisomy chromosome 21 , DS associate cognitive impairment , congenital malformation ( particularly cardiovascular ) , dysmorphic feature . In addition , immunological abnormality much prevalent individual DS . For example , DS associate increased susceptibility infection , reveal 2009 influenza pandemic likelihood death 300 time great DS patient general population . DS patient increase frequency autoimmune disorder leukemias , yet curiously , decrease risk allergic disease , particularly asthma . Perhaps tell statistic immunologic abnormality DS patient respiratory tract infection important cause mortality DS ages.Our study identify AIRE master control gene aberrantly decrease person DS , lead autoimmunity immunologic abnormality . AIRE ( `` autoimmune regulator '' ) , although encode chromosome 21 , also significantly reduce expression DS , may contribute autoimmune immune dysregulation . The investigator test hypothesis immune dysfunction autoimmune disease preferentially occur DS consequence deficient expression AIRE peripheral blood cell .</detailed_description>
