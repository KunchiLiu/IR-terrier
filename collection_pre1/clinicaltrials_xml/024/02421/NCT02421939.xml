	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine clinical benefit ASP2215 therapy patient FMS-like tyrosine kinase ( FLT3 ) mutate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) refractory relapse first-line AML therapy show overall survival compare salvage chemotherapy . This study also determine overall efficacy event-free survival ( EFS ) complete remission ( CR ) rate ASP2215 compare salvage chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ASP2215 Versus Salvage Chemotherapy Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase ( FLT3 ) Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects consider adult accord local regulation time sign informed consent may participate study . Subjects randomize 2:1 ratio receive ASP2215 salvage chemotherapy . Subjects enter screen period 14 day prior start treatment . Prior randomization , salvage chemotherapy regimen pre-selected subject ; option include low-dose cytarabine ( LoDAC ) , azacitidine , mitoxantrone , etoposide , intermediate-dose cytarabine ( MEC ) , fludarabine , cytarabine , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) idarubicin ( FLAG-IDA ) . The randomization stratify response first-line therapy pre-selected salvage chemotherapy . Subjects administer treatment continuous 28-day cycle . After treatment discontinuation , subject end-of-treatment visit within 7 day treatment discontinuation , follow 30-day follow-up safety , telephone contact subject sufficient unless assessment must repeat resolution treatment-related AEs . After , long term follow-up do every 3 month 3 year 30 day follow-up .</detailed_description>
