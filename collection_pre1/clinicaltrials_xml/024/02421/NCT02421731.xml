	<brief_summary>Gait disability affect personal activity quality life progressive multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient . A robot-driven gait orthosis allow effective support walk movement imitation nearly normal gait pattern treadmill train high speed develop recently introduce clinical setting . However , study evaluate effect Robot-Assisted Gait Training ( RAGT ) group stroke , spinal cord injury MS subject . In addition , training-induced neural biological change potentially related mechanism recovery remain undefined . The primary aim study : test feasibility RAGT group progressive severely disabled MS patient test hypothesis intensive intervention could higher benefit , compare conventional therapy alone , mobility improvement assess Timed 25 Foot Walk ( T25FW ) The secondary aim study : determine whether fatigue , Quality life , balance locomotor function improve RAGT ; determine whether gait training influence marker plasticity include clinical circulating biomarkers search possible correlation clinical outcome clinical circulating biomarkers</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , single-blinded , control study . Ninety-eight MS subject recruit identification subject U.O . Rehabilitative Medicine Rare Diseases Neuroimmune Center , IRCCS Neurosciences `` Bellaria '' ( BO ) . After evaluation eligibility obtain informed consent , patient enrol randomized two group randomization stratification approach . Subjects group stratum define degree impairment ( e.g . use outcomes Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS ) randomize separately within stratum accord block randomization assign one two treatment group : 1. robot-assisted gait training ( experimental group ) 2. conventional therapy ( control group ) Robot-assisted gait training : Patients receive 12 training session 4 week ( 3 sessions/week ) RAGT . During session subject wear harness attach system provide body weight support walk treadmill help robotic-driven gait orthosis . The leg guide accord physiological gait pattern . The torque knee hip drive adjust 100 % 0 % one leg . The speed treadmill adjust 0 km/h approximately 3 km/h body weight support 0 % 100 % . During first session set training parameter accord subject characteristic demand level . As training progress , adjustment assistance provide driven-gait orthosis , amount body weight support treadmill speed perform . Training session last hour 30 minute real walking time , subject set-up device take approximately 30 minute . Conventional therapy : The control group receive 12 conventional therapy session 4 week ( 3 sessions/week ) , focus gait training . Subjects receive 1 hour individual conventional physiotherapy session . During first 5-10 minute subject perform lower-limb core stretching exercise increase muscle flexibility ; 'll deal lower-limb muscle strengthen exercise tailor baseline characteristic ( 10 minute ) . After , assist over-ground walking training perform . Outcome measure Outcome measure assess week treatment initiation ( T0 ) , two week ( T1 ) , 4 week ( T2 ) 3 month follow-up ( T3 ) . Personnel blind treatment ass effect intervention .</detailed_description>
