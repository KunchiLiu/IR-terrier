	<brief_summary>The objective Males , Antioxidants , Infertility ( MOXI ) Trial examine whether treatment infertile male antioxidant formulation improve male fertility . The central hypothesis treatment infertile male antioxidant improve sperm structure function , result high fertilization rate improve embryo development , lead high pregnancy live birth rate . Findings research significant likely lead effective , non-hormonal treatment modality male infertility . An effective treatment men would also reduce treatment burden female partner , low cost , provide effective alternative couple religious ethical contraindication ART ( Assisted Reproductive Technology ) . If antioxidant improve pregnancy rate , improve sperm motility DNA integrity , could allow couple male factor infertility use less intensive therapy intrauterine insemination . Male fertility specialist currently prescribe antioxidant base limited data support use . A negative finding , lack benefit , would also alter current treatment infertile male .</brief_summary>
