	<brief_summary>Our primary hypothesis two week high-intensity task-oriented circuit training follow structured 3 month home exercise program would higher benefit compare delayed-treatment group control people multiple sclerosis mild moderate gait impairment . Our secondary hypothesis could retention clinical gain subject underwent TOCT plus structure 3 month home exercise program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single blind randomized-controlled trial test effect task orient train locomotor function , mobility balance multiple sclerosis subject mild moderate gait impairment ( EDSS 4-5.5 ) . Subjects methods:54 multiple sclerosis patient recruit two outpatient rehabilitation clinic ( Azienda Ospedaliero- Universitaria di Ferrara Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana ) . Informed consent obtain . Participants enrol include 2 different treatment group : experimental group receive 10 TOCT session 2 week ( 2 hours/each session ) follow 3 month home exercise program , whereas control group include delayed-treatment group . Three subject supervisor physiotherapist take part TOCT . Primary outcome measure walk endurance ( Six Minute Walking Test ) ; secondary outcome test gait speed ( Timed 25-Foot Walk ) , balance ( Dynamic Gait Index ) mobility ( Time Up Go Test ) ; self-assessment questionnaire evaluate motor fatigue ( Modified Fatigue Impact Scale - MFIS ) , walk ability ( Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale - 12 ) , health-related quality life ( Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - 29 Functional Assessment Multiple Sclerosis ) . In addition clinical outcome , convenience sample : ( ) balance assessment ( force platform ) ; ( ii ) motorcortex oxygenation walking ( fNIRS ) ; ( iii ) muscle oxygenation ( NIRS ) ; ( iv ) force EMG signal ; ( v ) mechanical electrical fatigue assessment ; ( vi ) brain connectivity ( EEG ) . Outcome measure assess 1 week prior treatment initiation ( T0 ) , two week treatment initiation ( T1 ) , 3 month exercise program ( T2 ) 3 month follow-up ( T3 ) evaluate treatment retention , clinician blind treatment . The specific aim ( ) test effect walk , mobility , balance , fatigue health-related quality life ; ( ii ) test effect cerebral oxygenation ( fNIRS ) walking ; ( iii ) muscle oxygenation ( NIRS ) ; ( iv ) force EMG signal ; ( v ) Mechanical electrical fatigue assessment ; ( vi ) brain connectivity ( EEG ) ( vii ) investigate 3 month home exercise program 's feasibility , satisfaction adherence .</detailed_description>
