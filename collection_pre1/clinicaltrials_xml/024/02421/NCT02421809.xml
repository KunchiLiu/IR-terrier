	<brief_summary>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) 'wheat sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) include spectrum gluten-related disorder . No data available prevalence oral lesion NCWS . Our study aim evaluate prevalence oral lesion NCWS patient search correlation clinical characteristic . This prospective observation study include 90 NCWS patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) - like symptom , 90 IBS 90 celiac control . Patients recruit Internal Medicine Gastroenterology Units University Palermo . Elimination diet double-blind placebo control ( DBPC ) wheat challenge prove NCWS diagnosis . All subject underwent oral examination ass presence oral soft hard tissue lesion potentially associate NCWS CD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Lesions In Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Celiac disease ( CD ) report increase risk oral lesion . More recently , report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . That previous study also show percentage NCWS patient weight loss anemia : whether depend intestinal malabsorption remain unclear . As yet data available presence prevalence oral lesion NCWS patient . The aims present study : 1 ) investigate presence prevalence oral lesion NCWS patient 2 ) search possible correlation oral lesion clinical characteristic NCWS patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose NCWS recently propose criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : negative serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibody ; absence intestinal villous atrophy ; negative IgEmediated immuneallergy test wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) ; resolution IBS symptoms standard elimination diet , exclude wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , selfreported food ( ) causing symptom ; symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge . As investigator previously describe study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge perform . Additional inclusion criterion : age &gt; 18 year ; followup duration longer six month initial diagnosis ; least two outpatient visit followup period . positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , also case normal villi/crypts ratio duodenal mucosa ; selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce , enter study ; `` organic '' gastrointestinal disorder ; nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder ; physical impairment limit physical activity ; menopause ; steroid sex steroid therapy , hormone replacement therapy ovariectomy .</criteria>
