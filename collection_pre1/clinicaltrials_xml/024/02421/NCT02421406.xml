	<brief_title>An Internet-based Behavioral Weight Loss Program HIV+ Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project provide empirically validated weight loss program HIV+ patient evaluate efficacy weight loss improvement cardiovascular disease risk factor . Investigators conduct randomize pilot study 50 overweight obese patient HIV+ , recruit Miriam Hospital Immunology Center , interested losing weight . These patient randomly assign 12 week behavioral weight loss program deliver via Internet 12 week education control group ( also Internet base ) . Primary aim study 1 ) determine whether Internet program appropriate patient population , assess success recruit 50 patient trial level adherence 12 week , 2 ) compare weight loss end 12 week program program patient randomized Internet behavioral weight reduction program ( WT LOSS ) relative Internet education program ( CONTROL ) , 3 ) compare efficacy WT LOSS program relative CONTROL improve lipid ( total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglyceride ) , metabolic measure ( fast blood sugar , insulin ) , inflammatory marker ( IL-6 , C-reactive protein , adiponectin ) , 4 ) compare change dietary intake physical activity baseline 12 week WT LOSS CONTROL condition . Investigators also store blood later analysis adipokines ( leptin ) biomarkers microbial gut translocation ( e.g. , sCD14 ) . These provide important pilot data future NIH funding related implementation weight loss program effect weight loss co-morbidities population .</detailed_description>
