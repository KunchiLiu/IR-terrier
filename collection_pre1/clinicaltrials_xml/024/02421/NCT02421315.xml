	<detailed_description>The capacity coordinate thought action execute goal-directed behavior ( cognitive control ) capacity anticipate , respond , learn reward ( reward processing ) key process human behavior . Dysfunction process hypothesize contribute repetitive thought behavior many disorder , include obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , Tourette Syndrome ( TS ) , eat disorder . The investigator use multimodal imaging investigate neural circuit support cognitive control reward processing , use pediatric OCD model system . The short-term goal clarify circuit-based abnormality contribute repetitive thoughts/behaviors ; data inform future transdiagnostic study . The long-term goal identify control reward circuit-abnormalities target new transdiagnostic treatment .</detailed_description>
