	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT Background : More two third sudden cardiac arrest witness bystander . Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) double survival cardiac arrest . Importantly , even witness cardiac arrest 20 % bystander commence basic life support . Common reason commence include panic perceive inability perform CPR correctly . A meta-analysis could demonstrate simplification algorithm ( compression-only dispatcher-assisted bystander CPR ) lead 22 % increase survival-to-hospital discharge . A recently publish trial research group could demonstrate presence flowchart positive effect quality BLS time increase rescuer ' confidence . Nonetheless , perform CPR exhaust . Previous publication emphasize increase fatigue duration CPR effort , standard chest compressions-only CPR . Consequently , want test hypothesis chest compression ( CC ) deliver correctly regard depth utilize standard BLS algorithm aid flowchart compare CC algorithm utilize adapt CPR flowchart manikin resuscitation model . Methods : After consent Research Ethics Board Medical University Vienna obtain write informed consent participant , 84 medically untrained layperson randomise perform flow-chart assist CPR 300s follow standard CPR guideline CC CPR . The primary outcome parameter total number CC achieve correct depth 50-60mm . Secondary outcome parameter hands-off time , total number CC , compression rate . The total number deliver rescue breath , tidal volume , time deliver also evaluate . Furthermore , subjective point exhaustion affect CPR quality , reason discontinuation CPR stop within 300sec . period exhaustion end CPR measure evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design The investigation conduct prospective , randomize control study perform Department Anaesthesia , General Intensive Care Pain Management , Medical University Vienna , Austria , accord Good Scientific Practise guideline Medical University Vienna . The data collection conduct cooperation Training Centre St. John Ambulance , Vienna , Austria . Study Population Eligible volunteer ≥18 year age non-medical profession , irrespective gender . Exclusion criteria professional medical training ( nurse , medical doctor , physiotherapist , ergotherepeuts , emergency medical technician equivalent ) , pregnancy ( verbal response time recruitment ) , parallel participation clinical trial , physical impairment illness prohibit physical effort . Withdrawal replacement subject Subjects must withdraw follow circumstance : - request - subject violates condition lay consent form/information sheet disregard instruction study personnel In case , reason subject withdraw must record detail case report form . Should study discontinue prematurely , study material ( complete , partially complete empty case report form ) retain . Subjects complete study accord protocol replace . The data replace subject eligible analysis conduct trial period safety variable . Methodology Sample Size In order detect clinically important difference 20 % compression depth power 0.8 significance level set 0.05 , sample size calculation yield total need number participant 74 . Since drop rate approx . 10 % must expect 84 participant recruit . Data regard compression depth utilize standard CPR technique manikin model ( 43±12mm ) provide previous publication use estimate sample size [ Rössler et al . 2013 ] Statistical Methods Outcome parameter : The primary outcome total number CC achieve correct depth 50-60mm five minute manikin CPR . With author want test hypothesis chest compression deliver correctly regard depth utilize standard BLS algorithm aid flowchart compare CC algorithm utilize adapt BLS flowchart manikin resuscitation model . The secondary outcome parameter hands-off time ( HOT ) , define sum total time elapse 300sec . BLS chest compression provide . This include pre-compression interval initial step BLS perform well interruption CC , e.g . order ventilate pause due reason include exhaustion . Furthermore , total number CC , compression rate evaluate . The total number deliver rescue breath , tidal volume , time deliver also evaluate . Furthermore , question regard follow point raise : `` During CPR without stop action , please tell u `` NOW '' perceive fatigue affect quality life support perform '' , `` How exhausted ( question raise directly discontinue CPR ) [ McDonald et al . 2013 ] ( Lickert Like Scale 1-10 ) . If participant choses abort resuscitation attempt open end question `` Why discontinue resuscitation attempt ? '' raise . Data management calculation Data describe absolute frequency percentages categorical data use mean standard deviation ( SD ) normally distribute data . All test p-values two-sided p≤0.05 regard statistically significant . Students t-test chi-sqare test use appropriate . As common practice , result Likert-like scale treat interval-measures thereby analyse use parametric test [ Norman et al . 2010 , Cariio et al . 2008 ] . Local data management do use Microsoft Excel Mac ( Microsoft Corporation , USA ) R Mac ( R Foundation Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) statistical analysis . [ R_Development_Core_Team 2009 ] Graphics create use PraphPad Prism Mac ( GraphPad Software Inc. , La Jolla , USA ) . Description study day Volunteers invite participate trial study personnel . Recruitment conduct Training Centre St. John ambulance , Vienna , Austria , start lesson . After give write informed consent , participant randomize use web base randomization program ( www.random.org ) allocate perform standard CPR CC . The randomization group allocation keep opaque seal envelope . The evaluation perform independent investigator use computer attach Resusci-Anne Skillreporter Laerdal-Medical® Laerdal Skillreporter Software Segstat ( Version 2.3.0 , Laerdal Medical , Stavanger , Norway ) . The participant ask perform BLS five minute manikin . The participant ask undertake action deem necessary rescue person simulated resuscitation manikin . Participants inform underlying hypothesis outcome parameter . The room prepare minimise outside interruption . Additionally , participant instruct indicate point time CPR feel fatigue affect quality life support perform . ( `` During CPR without stop action , please tell u `` NOW '' perceive fatigue affect quality life support perform . ) Participants group receive one chart right begin scenario information `` chart provide information perform CPR '' start clock instruction regard content . Both group receive introduction support . At begin scenario , manikin position supine position floor . There clock visible participant perform CPR . An investigator act bystander able call emergency medical service send look automate external defibrillator ( available scenario ) . Nonetheless , investigator instruct provide information perform CPR physically take part primary check , CC , mouth-to-mouth ventilation . Data step perform left document hardcopy case report form investigator exact time detail chest compression ventilation document electronically ( Laerdal Skillreporter Software Segstat ( Version 2.3.0 , Laerdal Medical , Stavanger , Norway ) ) . Checklists necessary step create base ERC BLS Guidelines 2010 manner publish previously [ Roessler et al . 2007 , Koster et al . 2010 ] . After five-minute period end , participant inform emergency medical service take stop performing CPR . Directly thereafter , ask following question `` How exhaust scale 1 10 , 1 indicate exhaustion 10 maximum exhaustion ? '' ( Lickert Like 1-10 ) . If participant choses abort resuscitation attempt five minute , open-ended question `` Why discontinue resuscitation attempt ? '' raise . Risk/benefit assessment : Apart physical strain muscle pain abrasion palm hand knee deliver chest compression , direct risk consequence participation trial . To ensure participant added value , detailed information ERC CPR algorithm give data collection . This information include write material 2010 CPR guideline , 2015 CPR guideline available .</detailed_description>
