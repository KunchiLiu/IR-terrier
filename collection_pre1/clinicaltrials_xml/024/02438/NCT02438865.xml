	<brief_title>Prophylactic Intravesical Chemotherapy After Radical Nephroureterectomy Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma : Randomized Controlled Trial Between Single Postoperative Dose Versus Maintenance Therapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Upper tact urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC ) arise urothelial line urinary tract renal calyx ureteral orifice . It comprise 10 % renal tumor 5 % urothelial malignancy ( Jemal et al. , 2007 ) . A common feature UTUC multiple anatomic location urinary tract either synchronous metachronous . While synchronous bladder tumor identify time evaluation UTUC , recurrent bladder tumor remain major concern . Incidence bladder recurrence management UTUC vary considerably 20 % - 50 % ( Kirkali Tuzel. , 2003 ; Hall et al. , 1998 ) . Although risk factor development bladder tumor post surgical management UTUC previously study , considerable variation observe literature . In recent meta-analysis , Seisen et al. , 2014 identify male gender , previous bladder cancer , preoperative chronic kidney disease patient-specific predictor . While tumor-specific predictor follow : positive preoperative urinary cytology , ureteral location , multifocality , invasive stage , necrosis . Lastly , treatment-specific predictor laparoscopic approach , extravesical bladder cuff removal , positive surgical margin . To date , two theory propose intravesical recurrence radical nephroureterectomy include intraluminal seeding single transform cell ( Habuchi et al. , 1993 ) pan-urothelial field defect e.g . carcinogenic exposure entire urothelial tract lead independent multifocal development ( Takahashi et al. , 2001 ; Jones et al. , 2005 ) . Therefore , suggest administration single dose intravesical chemotherapy early postoperative period might prevent seed transitional cancer cell therefore might help reduce incidence urothelial tumor recurrence first year post surgery ( O'Brien et al. , 2011 ) . To best knowledge , two randomize control trial investigate hypothesis ( O'Brien et al. , 2011 ; Ito et al. , 2013 ) . O ' Brien et al. , 2011 , report 16 % patient mitomycin C arm 27 % patient standard treatment arm develop bladder cancer recurrence within first year postoperative . Ito et al. , 2013 , report 16.9 % patient pirarubicin arm 31.8 % patient standard treatment arm develop bladder cancer recurrence within first postoperative year . Based finding , recommend last European association urology guideline postoperative instillation chemotherapy recommend avoid bladder cancer recurrence `` grade B recommendation '' ( Roupret et al. , 2013 ) . In 2001 Sakamoto et al. , examine significance intravesical instillation Mitomycin C cytosine arabinoside 2 year period . They show instillation would reduce recurrence rate bladder surgery upper urinary tract tumor . However , study underpowered detect desire difference . The investigator hypothesize 16 % incidence bladder tumor recurrence single postoperative instillation intravesical chemotherapy surgery UTUC might attribute influence pan-urothelial field defect theory . Therefore , investigator assume maintenance intravesical chemotherapy would significantly reduce percentage tumor recurrence . AIM OF THE WORK This clinical trial design compare effect single postoperative intravesical chemotherapy instillation versus maintenance therapy reduce bladder cancer recurrence surgery UTUC . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients : Type study A randomized control trial ( RCT ) , phase II . Study locality Urology Nephrology Center ( UNC ) Study design Patients UTUC prospectively randomize two group use excel software random table function : 1 . Group 1 : receive single intravesical dose epirubicin intravesical therapy ( 50 mg ) within 48 hour radical nephroureterectomy open bladder cuff excision . 2 . Group 2 : receive single intravesical dose epirubicin additional 6 weekly dos intravesical therapy ( 50 mg ) surgery monthly maintenance therapy 1 year . Exclusion criteria 1 . Patients history bladder tumor 2 . Patients synchronous bladder tumor 3 . Patients advanced stage ( T4 ) Power calculation Statistical analysis All statistical analysis perform use IBM v. 20 statistical software statistical test use appropriately whenever indicate . The calculation sample size conduct use G*power statistical software ( Faul F et al. , 2007 ) . The recurrence rate control arm study report 16 % single intravesical dose chemotherapy . If expect treatment effect maintenance chemotherapy similar observe bladder tumor , would reduction recurrence rate 38 % ) Huncharek M et al. , 2001 ) . Therefore , detect level difference power 80 % 5 % level significance , 35 patient require detect difference group ( 1 ) ( 2 ) accounting 15 % loss arm , 40 patient randomized arm . Methods : Intervention Patients randomly allocate one two group use excel software random table function day surgery . Radical nephroureterectomy do open laparoscopic approach bladder cuff excision perform open approach . All data prospectively maintain include patient ' demographic , preoperative laboratory parameter , operative detail postoperative complication Follow The scheduled follow accord EUA guideline ( Roupret M et al. , 2013 ) schedule urine cytology cystoscopy 3 month one year CT urography one year non-invasive tumor 6 month one year invasive tumor . All chemotherapy-related complication report . Outcome end-point The primary outcome study diagnosis intravesical recurrence within first year surgery . The secondary outcome determine adverse event postoperative morbidity , mortality survival patient UTUC .</detailed_description>
