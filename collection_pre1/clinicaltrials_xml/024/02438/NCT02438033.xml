	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation Parkinson 's disease well establish therapy . Current practice require tedious adjustment stimulation setting base frequent patient assessment . Ultimately , goal develop system program use signal record directly brain continuous basis . Our previous work identify abnormal electrical signal brain target stimulation potentially use develop self-programming system . In study , investigator test safety utility novel adapt device deliver stimulation brain also record brain signal patient implanted deep brain stimulation system . The purpose Phase I study understand safety device well relationship electrical signal measure deep within brain Parkinson 's symptom signal use guide self-programmed system . The study entail implant special device ( Activa PC+S ) place standard generator ( Activa PC ) compare clinical symptom , record brain signal , stimulation pattern one year period implantation . Specifically , investigator use Activa PC+S record GPi ( internal globus pallidus ) local field potential program visit , allow surgeon well characterize patient 's disease . At time , investigator evaluate safety new device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The device test Activa Primary Cell Sensing ( PC+S ) system consist deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) generator , specially adapt extension lead , DBS lead implant globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The Activa PC+S system differs currently FDA-approved device capable deliver therapeutic stimulation DBS lead also record electrophysiological signal lead . The goal pilot study evaluate ( 1 ) ass specificity stability electrophysiological signal record Activa PC+S system , ( 2 ) signal record system correlate clinical parameter non-invasive measure movement , ( 3 ) safety PC+S system . The Medtronic Activa Primary Cell ( PC ) DBS system proven record safety reliability extensive human clinical use years1 . The potential risk associate placement use device thoroughly describe previous human trial retrospective report . The PC+S device base currently approve device add sense capability . In protocol , evaluate Activa PC+S system use additional sensing component stimulation parameter commonly use treatment movement disorder . This trial follow non-randomized design rigorous comprehensive follow-up , describe . The study conduct Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center associate facility combine neurology neurosurgery movement disorder program , manage 1,000 patient PD . The study provide close follow-up patient DBS surgery team involve functional neurosurgeon neurologist expertise clinical care patient PD . Patients screen accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . Each patient inform study see interested participating . After patient sign inform consent , undergo baseline evaluation , qualify , undergo surgery implant deep brain stimulation system . After device implantation , patient complete comprehensive follow-up describe protocol . The patient return clinic least monthly first 3 month medication assessment program . Primary assessment administer monthly first 3 month , every 3 month 12 month post-operatively . LFPs record across time ( intraoperative , programming , chronically ) , across activity state ( quantitative accelerometer gyroscope measurement ) , across disease state ( medication , stimulation ) address primary research question propose . A comparison measure within person pre-treatment post-treatment performed . Also , pre-treatment post-treatment group mean standard deviation determine . Correlations LFP biosignals non-invasive measure clinical assessment movement perform . In addition , correlation LFP signal clinically-defined stimulation parameter evaluate .</detailed_description>
