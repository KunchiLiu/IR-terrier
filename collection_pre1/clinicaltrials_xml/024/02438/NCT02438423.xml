	<detailed_description>Title : A Phase I Study The Safety , Reactogenicity , Acceptability Immunogenicity Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Delivered either Microneedle Patch Hypodermic Needle . Population : healthy adult , 18-49 year inclusive Number Sites : One Study Duration : 12 month Subject Duration : 6 month Objectives : Primary : To evaluate safety reactogenicity follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( either staff self-administered ) . Secondary : To evaluate HAI titer follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver either microneedle patch hypodermic needle ( vaccine administer study staff ) . To evaluate unsolicited adverse event follow receipt IIV deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self-administered ) . To evaluate new-onset chronic illness ( NOCI ) follow receipt IIV deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self-administered ) . Exploratory : To evaluate microneutralizing antibody titer follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver either microneedle patch hypodermic needle ( vaccine administer study staff ) . To evaluate HAI +/- microneutralization ELISA titer follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self- administer ) compare inactivate influenza vaccine deliver hypodermic needle ( administer study staff ) . To evaluate HAI +/- microneutralization ELISA titer follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff ) compare inactivate Influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( self-administered ) . To evaluate T follicular helper cell follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self-administered ) compare inactivate influenza vaccine deliver hypodermic needle ( administer study staff ) . To evaluate innate immunity signature microarrays follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self-administered ) compare inactivate influenza vaccine deliver hypodermic needle ( administer study staff ) . To evaluate B memory cell , CD4 CD8 central memory effector T cell , intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) interferon-gamma interleukin-4 , cross reactive T cell follow receipt inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self- administer ) compare inactivate influenza vaccine deliver hypodermic needle ( administer study staff ) . To evaluate acceptability inactivate Influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch ( administer study staff self-administered ) compare inactivate influenza vaccine deliver hypodermic needle ( administer study staff ) . Schematic Study Design : This single center , partially blind , randomized phase I study healthy adult subject ( age 18-49 ) receive either inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV ) ( either microneedle patch hypodermic needle ) placebo ( microneedle patch ) . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , acceptability immunogenicity inactivate influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch . A total 100 subject ( 25 subject group ) randomize one four group schematic study design . Group A : Inactivated influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch administer study staff Group B : Inactivated influenza vaccine deliver intramuscular injection administer study staff Group C : Inactivated influenza vaccine deliver microneedle patch administer subject Group D : Placebo deliver microneedle patch administer study staff Each subject 6 clinic visit : D0 , D2 ( +1 day ) , D8 ( +2 day ) , D28 ( +/- 2 day ) , D56 ( +/- 5 day ) , D180 ( +/- 14 day ) . Blood draw obtain 6 clinic visit evaluate immunogenicity ( D0 , D2 ( +1 day ) D8 ( + 2 day ) - D28 ( +/- 2 day ) , D56 ( +/- 5 day ) , D180 ( +/- 14 day ) ) four clinic visit safety ( D0 , D2 ( +1 day ) , D8 ( +2 day ) , D28 ( +/- 2 day ) ) . Safety measure occurrence solicit injection site systemic reactogenicity day study product administration 7 day , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition 180 day study product administration . Immunogenicity test include perform hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) +/- microneutralizing antibody assay well adaptive immune assay D0 prior study product administration D8 ( +2 day ) , D28 ( +/- 2 day ) , D56 ( +/-5 day ) , D180 ( +/-14 day ) ) .</detailed_description>
