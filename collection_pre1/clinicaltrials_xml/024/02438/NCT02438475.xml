	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Extravascular , Water-Soluble Sealant Venous Access-Site Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate safety MynxGrip™ extravascular sealant common femoral vein closure follow diagnostic interventional procedure assess clinical imaging criterion venous thrombosis site closure device deployment . This single-center prospective study patient undergo either diagnostic interventional procedure . A total 208 patient enrol study follow hospital discharge safety purpose . The primary safety endpoint include deep venous thrombotic bleeding/vascular injury relate complication prior discharge . Outcomes assessed via clinical evaluation image clinically indicate follow : Assessment venous thrombosis . Clinical : Physical exam finding consistent venous thrombotic/thromboembolic relate complication : - Redness swell venous puncture site - Increased low extremity edema - Calf pain - New onset worsen shortness breath - New onset pleuritic chest pain ii . clinically indicated , imaging : venous Doppler ultrasound assessment obstructive non-obstructive deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) - Bleeding vascular related complication . Damage vessel require surgical repair ii . Access site bleed require need transfusion iii . Nerve injury access site iv . Generalized infection ( septicemia typical sign , symptom positive blood culture shortly index procedure , require treatment intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic ) Pseudo-aneurysms require invasive treatment - Device/procedure failure Device failure define either inability deploy device device deployment inadequate hemostasis require conversion immediate manual pressure , eventual need alternative method obtain hemostasis . Efficacy assess time hemostasis ; Time hemostasis define time advancer tube removal ( i.e. , device removal ) time hemostasis first observe . The study conduct follow either diagnostic interventional procedure venous access require ( via common femoral vein insertion 5 , 6 , 7F sheath ) . Femoral vein hemostasis achieve either manual compression MynxGrip VCD system . To assess primary safety outcome venous patency lack occurrence DVT , clinical assessment perform study team vascular access assessment group clinically indicate duplex ultrasound perform patient prior discharge evaluation presence venous thrombosis . After enrollment , subject randomized 1:1 : - Treatment Group A : Subjects venous hemostasis achieve use MynxGrip vascular closure system common femoral vein . - Treatment Group B : Subjects venous hemostasis achieve use manual compression common femoral vein . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , agree participate clinical study , sign inform consent enrol . The patient undergo clinically indicated procedure ( ) per standard care . The type procedure ( ) perform collect within CRF . Once clinically indicate procedure complete follow assessment make respect inclusion criterion : - Target vein maximal sheath size insert large 7Fr - Multiple ( &gt; 1 ) attempt venous access attempt target vein - Patient intra-procedural bleeding around access site prior sheath removal - Critically ill patient require intravenous vasopressor blood pressure stabilization - Ipsilateral femoral artery puncture sheath insertion - Glycoprotein IIb/IIIIa use - Any bleeding vascular access-site complication evident pre-venous closure If meet , patient consider screen failure . If one femoral vein attempt one access attempt without sheath insertion contralateral femoral vein use gain venous access , target vein closure would become vein one attempt achieve access also fit inclusion/ exclusion criterion . Randomization Enrollment Once patient meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion he/she consider enrolled study . Randomization perform block size 4 within site maintain 1:1 randomization throughout trial within two patient . Randomization assign consecutive order patient enrollment ID start 001 208 . The randomization assignment store within opaque envelope assigned/opened numerical order . Study Devices/ Procedures For randomization assignment commercial product us . Please follow commercial IFU deployment and/or position Mynx Vascular Closure . For manual compression please follow local institution standard care procedure . Follow-up Patients follow though hospital discharge ass primary safety outcome deep vein thrombotic and/or bleeding/vascular injury relate complication related target venous closure site . To assess primary safety outcome venous patency lack occurrence DVT , clinical assessment include follow systematic physician assessment target groin . Once patient place recovery room follow completion procedure , member Mynx Grip study team call ass groin , include information ; Assessment Venous Thrombosis : - Comparing mid calf mid thigh measurement prior post procedure . - Redness sell venous puncture site - Physical exam finding consistent venous thrombotic/thromboembolic relate complication ( i.e . vein engorgement , presence chord , syenosis ) - Increased low extremity edema - New onset worsen shortness breath - New onset pleuritic chest pain Bleeding Vascular Related complication : - Damage vessel require surgical repair - Access site bleed require need transfusion - Nerve injury access site - Generalized infection - Pseudo-aneurysms require invasive treatment In event Mynx Grip study team believe assessment venous thrombosis target femoral vein necessary , duplex ultrasound target femoral vein order . Presence venous thrombosis target vein assess base combination clinical symptom and/or result duplex ultrasound . Duplex ultrasounds submit assessed Duplex Ultrasound Core Lab systematic objective review presence venous thrombosis</detailed_description>
