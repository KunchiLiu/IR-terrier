	<brief_summary>This prospective single- center observational study Leiden University Medical Center approximately 250 child ( &lt; 12 year ) undergo elective cardiac surgery , congenital heart disease . The parents/guardians child ask fill questionnaire , asses respiratory symptom last week , operation child . In operating theatre , nasopharyngeal swab collect . Clinical data collect daily paediatric intensive care admission , date discharge paediatric intensive care unit hospital record . If child still intubate day 4 second nasopharyngeal swab residual blood collect . The sample test rhinovirus polymerase chain reaction . Main study parameter paediatric intensive care unit length stay per-operative rhinovirus -positive compare rhinovirus-negative patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>'The Impact Rhinovirus Infections Paediatric Cardiac Surgery '</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Respiratory infection consider carry potential risk adverse event child undergo surgery . Rhinovirus common cause respiratory infection congenital heart disease risk factor severe rhinovirus infection . However , know impact clinical subclinical rhinovirus infection postoperative course follow congenital heart surgery child . Based clinical experience , one case-controlled study , case report literature , hypothesize paediatric patient per-operative rhinovirus positive Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) test long paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) admission , compare child test negative . Objectives : Primary : To identify whether PCR-proven rhinovirus risk factor prolong PICU admission child undergo cardiac surgery . Secondary : develop preoperative algorithm identify child increase risk prolong PICU admission cardiac surgery . Study design : This prospective single-center observational cohort study Leiden University Medical Center ( LUMC ) . Methods Parents select patient receive information folder questionnaire mail ( ask sign symptom current and/or recent respiratory infection ) receive letter date admission operation . On day admission ( day -1 ) ( parent ) child admit cardiac surgery ask participate study fill write informed consent . At day 0 , operation day , operate theatre nasopharyngeal swab collect follow anaesthetic induction test rhinovirus . All clinician blind PCR result make known investigator virology department . Clinical laboratory data collect patient discharge hospital . Of patient still mechanical ventilation day 4 , additional nasopharyngeal swab sample scavenge sample blood request chemical laboratory available . Rhinovirus PCR perform nasopharyngeal swab blood determine shed viremia . Residual blood ( infection parameter ) collect three time point : induction anaesthesia , directly operation PICU admission day four ( 4 ) patient still ventilator support .</detailed_description>
