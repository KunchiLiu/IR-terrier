	<brief_title>Dimethyl Fumarate Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder involve collapse upper airway sleep , lead low blood oxygen level sleep disruption . Untreated OSA increase risk many health consequence , include high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke , diabetes , memory problem , fatigue , sleepiness , impaired memory . Despite profound public health societal impact , know medication effectively treat OSA , 50 % patient tolerate current treatment . The primary treatment OSA , know Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) , deliver mechanical device mask blow air airway keep open sleep . Although CPAP control OSA , many patient ca n't tolerate discomfort mask , 50 % patient use CPAP appropriately . Several recent study OSA patient suggest inflammation airway bloodstream may worsen OSA , medication control inflammation may improve OSA . In particular , previous study researcher suggest multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient MS therapy control inflammation may less severe OSA . MS autoimmune disease associate inflammation nervous system . As OSA may also cause worsened inflammation , clinical trial aim study effect specific MS medication know dimethyl fumarate ( brand name - Tecfidera® ) see may also useful treat OSA . Tecfidera® already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat patient MS . However , approve FDA treatment OSA thus consider investigational drug study . Study-related activity last 5 month . Consenting participant receive baseline overnight sleep study assess current sleep apnea severity . Participants give either oral dimethyl fumarate placebo period 4 month , follow monthly basis course study . At end study , participant undergo repeat overnight sleep study monitor change sleep apnea severity . Treatments assigned random ( like flip coin ) , participant aware treatment receive . There 2/3 chance participant receive dimethyl fumarate . Participants also undergo blood draw complete several survey monthly study visit . Participants compensate travel time throughout course study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1865 year screen ; 2 . Diagnosis OSA confirm previous clinical sleep study ( polysomnography , PSG ) ; 3 . Refusal , inability , high reluctance use CPAP regularly treatment OSA , despite medical advice ; 4 . Willingness undergo repeat sleep study ( PSG ) blood study ; 5 . Normal immune cell count , evidence complete blood count ( CBC ) do screen 1 . Regular use CPAP within last 2 month 2 . Physical , psychiatric cognitive impairment prevents informed consent , PSG , reliable followup ; 3 . Cardiac condition may increase sleep apnea severity ( e.g. , congestive heart failure recent heart attack ) ; 4 . Current successful treatment obstructive central sleep apnea , example CPAP , patient agreement continue treatment ; 5 . History surgical treatment OSA within past 6 month , subsequent last PSG confirmation OSA present ; 6 . Active nervous system disease may predispose subject OSA ; 7 . Systemic autoimmune disease could increase inflammation influence apnea severity ( rheumatoid arthritis lupus ) ; 8 . Pregnancy breastfeeding ; 9 .

Anticipated initiation dose change tricyclic antidepressant , selective serotonin uptake inhibitor , related compound ; 11 . Subjects history active , serious persistent infection . 12 . Subjects recent surgery ( within 3 month prior screen ) , anticipate surgery length study . 13 . Systemic steroid use within last 2 month ( include local steroid injection intranasal steroid spray ) ; 14 . Current diagnosis cancer consider cured remission treat physician , cancer treatment kind within last 6 month prior screen ( chemo , radiation , surgery ) , anticipated cancer treatment length study ; 15 . History lymphoproliferative disorder ( leukemia ) ; 16 . History Multiple Myeloma 17 . History decrease immune cell count per blood test know CBC , specifically lymphocyte count less 1.2 K/μL screening . 18 . Refusal use least one reliable method birth control ( woman childbearing age ) 19 . Newly diagnose ( within 2 month ) OSA subject AHI &gt; 30 history serious , recent , unstable cardiovascular disease ( include limit recent MI , recent stroke/TIA , unstable angina ) 20 . Subjects report previous motor vehicle accident nearmisses presumed due excessive sleepiness driving . 21 . Any condition treatment opinion investigator could affect subject safety study eligibility .</criteria>
