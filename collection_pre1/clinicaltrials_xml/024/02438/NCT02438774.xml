	<detailed_description>Study site , selection criterion setting : This study conduct three different agro-ecological zone ( AEZ ) Tanzania ; Northern Highlands , South-western Highlands Eastern Lowland zone . For zone , one maize-producing district , primarily home consumption , purposively select , Hanang ' district represent Northern Highlands , Kilosa district represent Eastern Lowland zone Rungwe represent South Western Highlands . For district , ten village ; five intervention five control randomly select . From village , 10 household choose . The selection criterion household local maize cultivar /grower , capacity store maize period less five six month harvest lactate mother child less 8 month age . Therefore , total 300 household ; 100 select district involve study . The three district divide division , ward village . A village low administrative unit consider geopolitical unit intact social group . It local government authority committee . Each village one agriculture extension officer Government employee Local Government Authority . The extension service provide include provision farmer knowledge , information , experience technology need increase sustain productivity improve wellbeing livelihood . Design : Study use Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial . Villages randomly assign either intervention control study group . The intervention duration 6 month . The control group continue receive routine agriculture extension service good practice handle crop , agricultural extension service farmer offer regularly village agriculture extension officer vilage level . The extension service provide include provision farmer knowledge , information , experience technology need increase sustain productivity , avoid crop spoilage storage improve wellbeing livelihood . The intervention group receive post-harvset intervention package addition routine agriculture education . Recruitment : One month harvest , infant age less 8 month recruit register birth child reproductive health clinic village . Infants less 8 month age identify use registration number date birth . In Tanzania , infant bear clinic register soon birth . In case home delivery , registration do day child take clinic immunization . On registration , child allocate registration number child 's particular include date place birth record . Inclusion criterion breastfeed infant age 0-8 month time recruitment , parent local residence , maize grower capacity store maize period less six month harvest . An exclusion criterion abnormality impair feed physical growth measurement infant . Ethical consideration : Application request ethical approval make National Institute Medical Research Tanzania . Local government nutritionist , resident nurse sociologists involve study . With help village executive officer , mother eligible infant request gather nearby health facility school informal meeting . During meeting , objective research , use result , benefit research procedure use select explain formal consent seek . Mothers also provide write form contain information . For mother able read write , resident nurse read consent form ask verbal consent . For mother give verbal consent , local nurse write her/his name consent form sign witness . Intervention : The developed post-harvest intervention package compose 5 component , namely 1 ) hand sort , 2 ) dry surface , 3 ) proper dry 4 ) application insecticide , 5 ) dehulling elaborate discuss among Local Government agriculture worker . They later provide guidance farmer explain intervention strategy demonstrate different technique include package . Farmers provide guideline apply developed package . The language communication intervention delivery Kiswahili , write spoken language country . Component 1 : Hand sort Separating damaged/infected maize kernel cobs health normal one help reduce spread mould storage . Farmers show identify damage maize kernel visibly mouldy . They encourage remove discard mouldy damage maize kernel storage . Component 2 : Drying practice Maize commonly spread bare ground sun drying , make susceptible humidity , fungal contamination soil , difficult gather event unexpected rain . Farmers train proper drying practice include dry maize mat . We provide intervention group dry mat . Component 3 : Proper sun dry Incomplete sun dry leaf residual humidity maize storage . Maize dry manner moisture level low require support mould growth storage ( generally less 13 % ) . This necessary prevent growth number fungal specie may present fresh grain . Farmers show judge completeness sun dry apply `` salt bottle technique '' ; technique , salt maize grain put together transparent glass bottle , shake 5 minute , salt stick wall bottle maize grain surface , indicate right moisture content attain , stickiness note , indicate completeness drying . The technique validate laboratory . Component 4 : Application insecticides One main factor affect mycotoxin formation presence insect storage facility , produce humidity via metabolic activity spread fungal spore . This may minimise use suitable , register insecticide fungicide . Farmers provide pack insecticide . Explanations application insecticide give farmer accord instruction use particular insecticide . Component 5 : Dehulling Mycotoxins likely concentrate out part ( pericarp embryo ) maize grain removal part would result reduction toxin level maize . Importance de-hulling explain farmer encourage de-hull maize milling . Data collection measure impact intervention package : Sample collection : Maize grain sample intend human consumption collect harvest six month harvest , ready cook maize flour breast milk sample take six month harvest . All sample transport Tanzania Food Drugs Authority Dar e Salaam laboratory analysis . Maize grain finely ground analysis . An information sheet prepare complete sample household collect information post-harvest practice . Dietary assessment : A food intake survey conduct five six month harvest . Replicas , 24h dietary recall technique use estimate amount maize base food consume infant mother . Two visit interval 1 2 week make home infant . In addition 24 dietary recall , food frequency questionnaire administer get information frequency consumption maize per week food commonly consume mother child . A questionnaire previously use researcher community Tanzania food consumption habit similar community area study use . The amount maize flour consume infant thin ( Uji ) stiff ( ugali ) porridge assess use Lucille food intake software Ghent University . This also carry accordance quantity food consume food preparation technique describe Tanzania food composition table . Breast milk intake estimate document United State Environmental Protection Agency ( US-EPA , 2011 ) . Anthropometric measurement : Each child 's weight date birth obtain clinic card aregister birth local health clinic . Mycotoxin analysis : Chemical reagent : Aflatoxins total , aflatoxin M1 Fumonisins standard . Acetonitrile , Acetic acid Methanol HPLC grade , Methanol , HCL , KOH , BORAX , OPA . Aflatoxin B1 , B2 , G1 G2 determine maize accordance method describe Stroka et al ( 2000 ) . It extract cleaned use AflaStar immunoaffinity column ( AIC ) , AFM1 analyse breast milk describe ( Magoha et al . 2014 ) extraceextracted clean use immunoaffinity column AFM1 ( AFLAPREP M ) fumonisin analysis breast milk maize flour analyse described ( Magoha et al . 201a ) ( Sydenham et al . 1992 ) respectively , case sample extract cleaned use SAX column , extract dry nitrogen reconsituted ACN : H20 ( 1:1 ) , derivatization do OPA . Quantification toxins do use HPLC RF-10AXL detector . Exposure assessment risk characterisation : The exposure child mycotoxin assess combine maize consumption data contamination data analysis . The exposure assess individually , use individual consumption data body weight ( bw ) infant accord follow formula : Ei , j = Ci x Lj/Bwi Where Ei , j exposure contaminant j ( μg/kg bw/day ) subject , Ci , consumption level maize subject ( kg/ day , Lj level contaminant j maize ( μg/kg ) , BWi body weight subject ( kg ) . The individual exposure mycotoxin compare health base guidance value ( TDI , PMTDI , PTWI ) , child rate exceed health-based guidance value calculate 95 % confidence interval . Data management statistical analysis : Data enter double Epipdata 3.1 ( Odense Denmark ) . Data analysis carry SPSS version 16.0 Windows . Statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 test . Chi square test use determine association post-harvest handling practice maize fumonisins aflatoxin content maize breast milk exposure infant .</detailed_description>
