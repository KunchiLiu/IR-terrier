	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want learn people alcohol dependence difficulty learn feel calm , learn fear thing easily . They also want study early life stress ( ELS ) affect ability learn feel calm . Objective : - To see people alcohol dependence and/or ELS harder time learn feel calm people without . Also , see DNA change ELS change affect fear condition extinction . Eligibility : - Adults age 21-65 without alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) without ELS . - Healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Psychological test - Treatment symptom alcohol withdrawal , need - Healthy volunteer 1 overnight visit ( 2 day , 1 night ) . AUD participant stay clinic 4 week . - Participants : - Rate alcohol use/craving , depression , anxiety , childhood trauma . - Have psychophysiological measure : electrode mild electric shock . - Have functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants lie table metal cylinder coil head . In first scanning session , see picture , simple task , may get shock . Participants also second scan session perform aforementioned fear conditioning extinction task , well facial expression match task , affective word processing task , task measure valuation monetary reward . - Answer question emotion ( participant ) . - Have blood draw arm vein intravenous ( IV ) line . - AUD participant get dexamethasone pill . The next day , get hormone inject blood drawn IV line . - AUD participant 3 follow-up visit question blood lab test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary goal study evaluate role interaction ( epi ) genetic factor , early life stress ( ELS ) exposure , alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) neuronal mechanism fear condition extinction . The central hypothesis participant AUD ELS disrupt fear extinction , addition , ELS also disrupt fear extinction . AUD ELS severe disruption fear extinction observe clinically alcoholic severe trauma - often present severe phenotype treatment resistant . A disruption fear extinction live constant fear stress/trauma could thus put individual risk AUD . Identification characterization neurobiological correlate underlie mechanism thus essential could provide new avenue treatment AUD ; namely develop intervention normalize abnormal fear extinction . These intervention could example , cognitive-behavior base molecular target genetic/epigenetic pathway potentially identify . Our proposal , successful , first establish reliable measureable endophenotype fear extinction AUD/ELS , behaviorally ( skin conductance response ) neuronal ( use fMRI paradigm ) . Furthermore , carry exploratory genetic epigenetics study might influence measure . This model use follow study novel therapeutic intervention could target treatment mechanisms AUD . Study Population : The study sample include two patient group two control group : 1. treatment-seeking non-treatment-seeking individual AUD ELS exposure ; 2. treatment-seeking non-treatment-seeking individual AUD without ELS exposure ; 3. healthy volunteer ELS exposure ; 4. healthy volunteer without ELS exposure . Target accrual group 25 . Design : Subjects evaluate fear conditioning extinction use shock conditioning ( extinction procedure combine fMRI image utilizes galvanic skin response ) . All participant undergo whole-genome methylome analysis assess genome wide methylation pattern . Genotyping variant candidate gene implicate biology fear conditioning/extinction carry . Outcome Parameters : The primary outcome interest fear extinction , measure fMRI paradigm . Secondary objective include : ( 1 ) explore role genetic variant epigenetic factor impact fear extinction AUD healthy control without ELS ; ( 2 ) explore difference reward process emotion processing , measure fMRI function AUD , ELS , ( epi ) genetic modulators ; ( 3 ) examine relationship fear extinction clinical outcome AUD ELS participant sample .</detailed_description>
