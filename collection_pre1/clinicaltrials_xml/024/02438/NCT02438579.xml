	<brief_summary>Viral upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) , one common infection face human , significant impact individual , family , health service economy . Though rhinovirus call `` common cold virus '' , numerous virus cause URTI . Hence virus specific remedy URTI impractical . There currently evidence-based intervention reduce severity , symptom duration viral shed . Preliminary evidence suggest hypertonic saline nasal irrigation gargling ( HSNIG ) may reduce duration symptom . With pilot randomise control trial ( RCT ) , investigator aim assess feasibility undertake definitive RCT HSNIG adult URTI . This pilot focus recruitment rate , willingness randomise , acceptability , compliance likely effect size intervention . This pilot RCT compare HSNIG vs. usual care 60 adult . Serial self-collected mid-turbinate swab help assess change viral shed . Symptomatic relief measure validated symptom score . A questionnaire base participant feedback help assess intervention trial procedure . This mixed-methods pilot trial help inform plan definitive RCT low-cost intervention potential substantial health societal benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Aims : To assess feasibility undertake RCT HSNIG adult URTI focus recruitment rate , willingness randomise , acceptability , compliance likely effect size intervention . 1.1 . Research question : 1 . What likely rate recruitment loss follow-up ? 2 . Are study procedure acceptable participant ? 3 . Is likely reduction duration symptom viral shed ? 4 . What effect size estimate definitive trial relation duration symptom improvement quality-of-life ? 2 . Subjects : 2.1 Sample size : This pilot trial formal sample size calculation indicate . However , sample size 27 per group investigator would able express proportion return symptom score diary sample within group within ±19 % base two-sided 95 % confidence interval around expect proportion 0.5 . With two group combine [ i.e . sample size 54 ] investigator would able express proportion within ±13 % . To allow 10 % dropouts sample size increase 30 per group . 2.2 Recruitment : The investigator propose enrol total 60 participant ( 30/arm ) pilot . The investigator plan recruit advertising study community follow route . - Sending flyer parent school run Edinburgh Midlothian council . - Study website ( www.elvisstudy.com ) , National Health Service ( NHS ) Lothian , University Edinburgh websites . - Local medium coverage way interview . - Flyers workplace large number staff ( e.g . bank , supermarket , council ) . - Posters pharmacy General practitioner ( GP ) surgery . Interested individual ask contact trial nurse clinical research facility ( CRF ) situate Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) Western General Hospital within 48 hour symptom onset . The trial nurse consent , randomise , recruit volunteer . Participants advise go GP per norm become unwell withdraw study wish reason . At end participation study , give £30 recompense inconvenience . 3 . Research Methods : 3.1 Randomisation : Participants randomise 1:1 ratio receive intervention control , do use online randomisation minimise sex ( M/F ) smoking status ( current/not current smoker ) allocate treatment arm probability 0.9 ensure random allocation . 3.2 Instructions participant : 3.2.1 Both arm : Participants teach complete ( online paper ) modify short Wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey ( WURSS-21-Scot ) EQ-5D-5L questionnaire . Baseline symptom score record participant . Participants teach collect nasal swab . A baseline swab collect observation send virology laboratory Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) . Swabs , transport medium Royal Mail Safebox provide participant collect nasal swab first thing morning ( HSNIG intervention arm ) four consecutive day return laboratory . 3.2.2 Intervention arm : The intervention group show video prepare hypertonic sea-salt solution perform HSNIG . They ask perform procedure supervision . The trial nurse help identify high concentration saline comfortable . Participants advise perform intervention frequently require ( expected frequency around 6 times/day first two day , reduce frequency day 3 symptom improve ) . A package contain instruction , digital-measuring spoon , sea-salt , equipment irrigation flask ( wish prepare solution multiple us day ) hand participant . Participants intervention arm also document compliance side effect daily 3.2.3 Control arm : They advise manage URTI normally . 3.3 Data collection : 3.3.1 `` WURSS-21-Scot '' diary EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire : All participant complete `` WURSS-21-Scot '' diary set time day . Participants answer question `` unwell feel today '' . If score &gt; 0 , symptom functional ability grade 0-7 . They answer global change question . Total score/day calculate sum score 10 symptom daily . All participant also answer EQ-5D-5L questionnaire . The following information collect recruitment : heard study , influenza vaccination history , number family member whether sufficient information provide . The intervention arm also answer follow question daily : many time perform HSNIG , perform one part HSNIG side effect . Both arm answer take medication URTI whether need contact GP management URTI . Diaries maintain participant record `` unwell '' two consecutive day maximum 14 day follow terminate individual need treatment . 3.3.2 Virology : Swabs send Department Virology , RIE test . Baseline sample test identify individual aetiology proven . If viral aetiology identify , sample ( day 0 - day 4 ) test parallel identify change viral shedding . 3.3.3 Data collection procedure : The trial nurse follow participant complete diary return sample ( 48 hour expect return ) . Information number family member URTI collect end study . Feedback collect participant follow-up period . These address acceptability , health service use , cost patient suggestion improve study procedure main trial . 4 . Data Analysis : The number participant return swab , complete diary follow treatment per protocol present percentage ( 95 % confidence interval ) . The investigator present recruitment overall rate , also graphically likely seasonal variation . Using result swabs investigator determine person stops viral shedding , use chi-square chi-square test trend , determine relationship group . Using two-sample t-tests non-parametric equivalent appropriate investigator determine evidence difference duration symptom symptom severity [ define maximum WURSS-21-Scot score treatment period ] . Feedback analyse use conventional content analysis approach , emerge finding discuss research team aid interpretation finding .</detailed_description>
