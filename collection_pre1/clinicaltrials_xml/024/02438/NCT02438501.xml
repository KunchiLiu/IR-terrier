	<brief_title>Efficacy Palliative Low-Dose Involved-Field Radiation Therapy Recurrent Advanced Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Follicular lymphoma（FL ) often involve lymph node bone marrow widely regard systemic advanced-stage disease diagnose two-thirds patient initial presentation . Follicular lymphoma Grade 1 2 indolent histologic characteristic presently consider curable majority patient though sensitive chemotherapy radiotherapy . The policy treat patient stage III IV FL , recommend NCCN , suggest regimen , clinical trial local RT ( palliation ) base previous result similar efficacy obtain management chlorambucil single-agent therapy , polychemotherapy , immunochemotherapy , RT CMT ( RT Chemotherapy ) . Patients advanced-stage disease tend frequent relapse interval subsequent relapse tend shorten time . However , usually relatively long life expectancy , median survival range 6 10 year . Try change natural history FL long term PFS goal treatment advance stage FL . Since treatment strategy , watch wait , manage Standford 1980s , several prospective randomize trial fail demonstrate survival advantage immediate treatment versus `` watch wait '' approach patient advanced stage , low tumor burden FL . Though many systemic therapy option available patient stage III IV FL , consensus first-line treatment provide patient . `` Watch wait '' approach still recommend patient even rituximab era . GELA provide indication treatment , treatment patient initiate . The role traditional RT without chemotherapy advance stage FL definite . FL consider one radiosensitive tumor . However , significant proportion patient relapse systemic disease outside radiation field difference OS observe advanced patient RT alone CMT . The complication related traditional RT , include cardiovascular disease disorder blood cell production , need emphasize indolent advance patient need frequent palliative management long-term survive NHL . In order decrease late complication Large-field RT , reduction irradiation field small therapeutic dos radiation commonly manage . Many trial patient advance recurrent FL manage low-dose ( 4Gy ) limited-field RT show high response rate durable remission achieve . The response rate ( either complete partial response ) report previous study low-dose involved-field RT ( LD-IFRT ) give 2 daily fraction ( 2×2 Gy ) 81 % 92 % . The median time first recurrence 14 15 month . The median overall survival patient positive response 41 month . The median time in-field progression 21months , median time out-field progression 8 month . The predominant mode tumor cell death low-dose RT may apoptosis . Two phase III trial design assess role LD-IFRT . However , result fail demonstrate lasting response rate ( RR ) LD-IFRT versus approach . The HOVON 47/EORTC 20013 Intergroup study ( www.hovon.nl ) compare LD-IFRT chlorambucil chemotherapy previously untreated FL patient , main end point include progression-free survival quality life evaluate . However , trial close 2005 21 case include clinical adoption rituximab . The age eligible patient older 65 year . Another trial , Follicular Radiotherapy Trial ( CRUK- FORT ) , launch recently United Kingdom randomize patient FL need RT 24 Gy 12 fraction versus 4 Gy 2 fraction either definitive palliative treatment FL . A significantly low overall response rate ( 81 % vs 74 % ) 2-year local progression-free rate ( 94 % vs 80 % ) find 4Gy group . Over half patient clinic trial stage I stage II . Moreover , histology include many pathologic subtypes indolent lymphoma besides follicular Grade 1 2 . The role prognostic factor treatment efficacy consensus . Histology show significantly influence response rate . Compared subtypes indolent lymphoma , high response rate low-dose involved-field radiotherapy ( LD-IFRT ) palliative treatment indolent lymphoma explore follicular lymphoma . Age diagnosis , prior systemic therapy estimate . In retrospective review Girinsky et al . 48 patient indolent lymphoma treat LD-IF-RT , factor significantly associate lack response include bulky tumor ( &gt; 5 cm ) , high number prior chemotherapy regimen , age＞65 year . Haas et al . report experience 109 patient recurrent indolent B-cell NHL treat LD-IF-RT . Patients one two lymphoma site disease size ＜5 cm significantly likely achieve CR . The management advance FL patient relapse disease initial management affect significant toxicity associate Chemotherapy Radiotherapy . The role low-dose involved-field radiotherapy ( LD-IFRT ) palliative treatment advanced FL explore . LD-IFRT select patient include advanced FL , age low 65 year disease size ＜5 cm may excellent effection achieve repeat remission limit associative toxicity may postpone need systemic therapy . The management valuable assess .</detailed_description>
