	<brief_title>Correlation Infliximab Levels With Outcomes Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infliximab approve induction maintenance clinical remission mucosal heal patient moderate severe active ulcerative colitis , inadequate response conventional therapy IV steroid . It typically dose 5 mg/kg 0 , 2 , 6 week , follow 5 mg/kg every 8 week thereafter . The alternative rescue medical therapy infliximab proctocolectomy ileal pouch anastomosis , carry risk include pouchitis , fecal incontinence , pouch failure require surgical procedure female infertility , proctocolectomy permanent end-ileostomy , many patient wish avoid . The induction regimen 3 dos Infliximab follow maintenance dose every 8 week use achieve response hope avoid colectomy . Unfortunately , large proportion patient unable achieve sustain clinical response time end get colectomy . Potential implicate pathways non-responders include fecal wasting infliximab factor accelerate drug clearance large TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) CRP ( C reactive protein ) burden , anti-infliximab antibody ( ATI ) , low serum albumin , male sex large body size . Patients severe ulcerative colitis fail corticosteroid standard dose infliximab usually proceed proctocolectomy . Optimizing early infliximab blood level patient moderate-severe ulcerative colitis administer second dose infliximab week 2 could improve efficacy reduce need colectomy . However , paucity literature relatively new school thought . Our study address deficit evaluate relationship early drug level infliximab ulcerative colitis colectomy rate one three month .</detailed_description>
