	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well afatinib dimaleate cetuximab work compare afatinib dimaleate alone treat patient newly diagnose stage IV recurrent ( come back ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer . Afatinib dimaleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether afatinib dimaleate effective give alone cetuximab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1403 , Afatinib Dimaleate With Without Cetuximab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IV Recurrent , EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate sufficient evidence continue phase III component compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient randomize afatinib ( afatinib dimaleate ) combination cetuximab versus afatinib alone first-line treatment patient advance EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Phase II ) II . To determine efficacy combination afatinib cetuximab compare afatinib alone measure overall survival ( OS ) first-line treatment patient advance EGFR-mutant NSCLC . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) subset patient measurable disease treat afatinib plus cetuximab compare afatinib alone . II . To assess safety treatment arm use first-line setting . III . To compare time treatment failure time treatment discontinuation randomize afatinib combination cetuximab versus afatinib alone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate molecular mechanism confer benefit afatinib afatinib plus cetuximab evaluate whether presence de novo EGFR T790M mutation molecular alteration pre-treatment tumor influence clinical outcome . II . To quantitatively assess whether ratio sensitize EGFR ( EGFRs ) mutation EGFR T790M influence outcome altered treatment . III . To evaluate frequency know mechanisms resistance EGFR-directed therapy context afatinib plus cetuximab afatinib alone treatment . IV . To identify potential novel predictor benefit afatinib plus cetuximab . V. To identify potential new mechanism resistance EGFR-directed therapy . VI . To establish patient-derived xenograft ( PDXs ) subset patient re-biopsy time progressive disease drug test genomic analysis . VII . To assess whether circulate tumor marker use indicator sensitivity resistance afatinib plus cetuximab afatinib alone . VIII . To determine whether level EGFR protein immunohistochemistry predict benefit afatinib plus cetuximab afatinib alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive afatinib dimaleate Arm I . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
