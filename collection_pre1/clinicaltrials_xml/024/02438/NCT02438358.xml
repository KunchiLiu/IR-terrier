	<brief_summary>For breast cancer patient , surgery primary treatment . When patient undergo lumpectomy , difficult surgeon determine extent tumor result incomplete tumor removal determine positive margin assessment several day initial surgery complete . Most patient positive margin undergo second even third surgery complete tumor removal . The investigator hypothesize LUM Imaging System reduce rate positive margin , thus , rate second surgery identify microscopic residual cancer tumor bed . This non-randomized , open label study evaluate safety efficacy intraoperative imaging system , LUM Imaging System ( LUM015 conjunction LUM 2.6 Imaging Device ) , identify residual cancer tumor bed female breast cancer subject . The study compose Feasibility Trial divide two phase : Phase A ( 15 total subject ) Phase B ( 50 total subject ) . During Phase A , 15 subject evaluate collect additional patient safety data , select dose LUM015 Phase B evaluate device function . During Phase B , subject injected LUM015 dose determine Phase A preliminarily assess performance detection algorithm pathology margin assessment . In Phase B , surgeon perform standard care surgery use LUM Imaging System guide removal additional cavity shaving indicate LUM Imaging System .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Intraoperative Imaging Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LUM Imaging System consist cancer image agent LUM015 hand-held fluorescence-based imager collect emission activate LUM015 around tumor . The LUM Imaging System design detect microscopic residual cancer cell real-time within tumor bed . In study , evaluate performance LUM Imaging System detect residual cancer guide removal lumpectomy . In Phase A , patient receive standard care surgery follow intraoperative imaging tumor bed resected tissue LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . In Phase A , clinical decision make base imaging result . Standard care margin assessment perform compare image result LUM Imaging System . Subjects Phase B receive standard care surgery follow intraoperative imaging tumor bed LUM Imaging System . In Phase B , surgeon remove additional shave margin specimen indicate LUM Imaging System . Final margin assessment perform last shaved margin specimen remove . All participate subject observe collect safety data time injection LUM015 time clinical team decide additional surgery need .</detailed_description>
