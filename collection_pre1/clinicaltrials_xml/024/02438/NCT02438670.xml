	<brief_summary>The goal propose study compare use PID ( Proportional-Integral-Derivative ) controller versus MPC ( Model Predictive Control ) controller algorithm artificial pancreas system , component study design equal . The study design , power calculation endpoint develop base result initial feasibility study ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01987206 ) already complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MPC Versus PID Closed Loop Insulin Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize crossover study consist evaluation either type control algorithm ( MPC PID ) part Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device two period 27.5-hour closed-loop control minimally supervise setting ( outpatient research area William Sansum Diabetes Center , Santa Barbara , CA ) separate minimum 5 day maximum 2 week . The 27.5-hour period include : 2 announce meal ( dinner breakfast 65g 50g CHO respectively ) precede dose rapid-acting insulin equivalent 100 % bolus base subject 's Insulin Carbohydrate ( I : C ) ratio 1 unannounced meal ( lunch 65g carbohydrate , meal content dinner ) ; complete night 12:00 7:00 . The goal demonstrate AP device able maintain subject blood glucose within safe range time .</detailed_description>
