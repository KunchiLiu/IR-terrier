	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary Objective To provide compassionate access Miltenyi device CD34+ cell infusion patient experience poor graft function stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compassionate Access Miltenyi Device CD34+ Cell Selection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The therapy receive involves give infusion CD34 positive stem cell . Below detailed explanation therapeutic procedure perform . CD34 positive stem cell infusion : The CD34 positive stem cell collect donor 's blood . The blood cell go CD34 ( stem cell ) selection process collect stem cell need infusion . This process collect early immune cell body need regrow immune system , make sure cell infuse . This process decrease ( eliminate completely ) type cell . If agree receive treatment , CD34 cell infuse body . The CD34 positive cell give vein either inpatient outpatient treatment area . The infusion last 10-30 minute . Before infusion , receive Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth Benadryl ( diphenhydramine hydrochloride ) mouth vein 30-60 minute infusion . These drug use help low risk side effect . If side effect occur infusion , dose drug may adjust ( ) symptoms go . Also , side effect infusion , observe 2 hour give symptom stop completely ( whichever later ) . During time , blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature , level oxygen blood check every 15-30 minute . About 4-6 week first infusion , may receive additional infusion , doctor think need . Clinic Visits : One ( 1 ) time week infusion , doctor think longer clinically need , follow test : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You check sign graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Symptoms GVHD include skin rash , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abnormal liver function . This investigational study . The CD34 positive stem cell infusion help boost cell count FDA approve . Up 30 patient enrolled treatment .</detailed_description>
