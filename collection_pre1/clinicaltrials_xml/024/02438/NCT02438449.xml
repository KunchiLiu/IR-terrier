	<brief_summary>It estimate 25 % 40 % health care expenditures Canada USA respectively waste inefficiency practice evidence-based medicine . As health care resource scarce behooves u use cost-effective manner . The term `` cost-effective '' use health care literature often erroneously . Investigators compare `` novel ' intervention `` prevailing '' one novel intervention less costly label `` cost-effective '' . In methodologically correct cost-effectiveness study however , investigator need integrate effectiveness cost compete intervention calculate incremental cost-effective ratio . If ratio fall within acceptability threshold , novel intervention label cost-effective . There many technique breast reconstruction . The two common approach Autologous Abdominal Tissue ( AAT ) Tissue Expansion / Implant reconstruction . In study two common breast reconstruction approach mastectomy due cancer perform Hamilton/Niagara/Haldimand/Brant Waterloo/Wellington LHINs investigate cost-effectiveness analysis couple methodologically robust observational study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cost-Effectiveness Abdominal-based Autogenous Tissue v Tissue Expander-Implant Reconstruction - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result recent advance treatment breast cancer carry dedicated researcher make possible breast cancer research , mortality gradually decline . Naturally , quality survivorship take important role last 3 decade . Unfortunately , woman breast cancer , concern survival follow closely concern body image , sexuality , self-esteem social life . Mastectomy , mainstay treatment breast cancer , primary cause latter concern . The investigator therefore charge look disease respective treatment breast cancer holistically . Providing comprehensive management breast cancer today require attention oncologic principle patient 's quality life . A large part patient 's quality life come improved reconstructive aesthetic outcome follow mastectomy . In short , breast reconstruction mastectomy cancer aim improve body image quality life reduce negative psychological impact deformity . Multiple technique exist accomplish goal . They include breast implant , autologous tissue , occasionally , combination thereof . Although ultimate goal recreate aesthetically please breast attempt match miss one , decision use particular technique multi-factorial . It may influence surgeon 's skill , patient 's preference , inherent contraindication patient , resource available particular setting . Breast reconstruction costly patient ( indirect cost ) , third party payer society , especially new technology introduce clinical practice . In last 2 decade third party payer government different jurisdiction advocate production evidence show `` value money '' germane different procedures.Presently , two common approach breast reconstruction AAT method TE/I method . These two approach breast reconstruction yet submit economic evaluation use state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year age old . 2 . Patients undergo breast reconstruction ( immediate delay ) mastectomy procedure one breast . 3 . Eligible two step tissue expander implant base procedure , one follow autogenous abdomen tissuebased procedure ( pedicled TRAM flap , Free TRAM , m TRAM flap , DIEP flap , SIEA flap , Rubens flap ) . 1 . Patients previous breast reconstruction surgery . 2 . Patients undergoing procedure reconstruction surgery , mastectomy case immediate delay reconstruction . 3 . Patients unable complete questionnaire due language barrier . 4 . Geographic inaccessibility inability adhere study protocol requirement .</criteria>
