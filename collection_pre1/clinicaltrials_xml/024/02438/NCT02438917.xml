	<detailed_description>Chronic liver injury lead accumulation protein liver form dense scar . Liver scar formation typically slow process lead major organ damage loss function course many year . During scar formation extracellular matrix liver change . The type quantity extracellular collagen protein change tissue remodeling . Some change detect analyze factor present blood . Because lengthy time course , change rate liver scar formation regression difficult measure ; however , accurate measurement need order conduct trial intervention aim prevent scar formation and/or promotion scar regression . Current method sub-optimal specificity selectivity . The long term objective study identify serum protein use accurately estimate rate liver fibrosis progression regression . The project focus novel methodology use stable isotope label deuterated water , D2O , tag newly-synthesized protein . Mass spectroscopy use identify individual protein quantify ratio label protein total protein . This ratio provide information rate synthesis protein interest . This method apply specimens patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection begin HCV treatment . Treatment known reduce liver inflammation collagen content . The main question address whether regression scar liver predict base half-life serum protein identity proteins best indicator liver scar formation regression . The long term goal study develop non-invasive test use estimate extent liver fibrosis rate liver fibrosis generation regression . Such marker could use test drug promote fibrosis regression and/or prevent fibrogenesis could also use provide patient healthcare provider information extent liver scarring . Research do around globe determine develop innovative method accurately determine liver status . A metabolic labeling method test project . This approach base concept liver status determine measure ratio newly-synthesized/pre-existing protein . Patients give `` heavy water '' drink . Heavy water contain D20 . Deuterium stable isotope hydrogen . Deuterium radioactive . It give many patient consider entirely safe administer accord protocol use study . Proteins synthesize D20 label contain D20 . Mass spectrometry use determine percentage scar protein ( indicator protein ) newly-synthesized . The analysis perform variety tissue bodily fluid . In study , measurement make blood , saliva , urine sample participant . Study subject give option undergo liver biopsy . The D20 content biopsy tissue determine patient elect option . The study group investigation comprise patient chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection begin HCV treatment . It well establish HCV treatment reduces amount inflammation scar liver . New treatment HCV far effective less toxic early treatment . The treatment-induced change inflammation hepatic scar impact ratio proteins metabolic label study . The rate synthesis scar protein go ratio new/pre-existing protein change . Metabolic label data compare data liver status , value serum marker , liver stiffness measurement , liver histopathology ( available ) . Research perform Mount Sinai Medical Center , cod , de-identified specimen analyze Kinemed Patients initiate treatment HCV infection source potential subject . The final study group expect include 40 subject . We expect 2/3 subject approach agree participate sign consent document . We expect 90 % 40 subject complete first 6 month study expect 80 % complete entire study . This single center study The duration individual subject 's participation study : 36 month ( include follow ) The duration anticipate enroll study subject : 6 month</detailed_description>
