	<brief_title>CardiAMP™ Heart Failure Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure clinical condition output blood heart insufficient meet metabolic demand body . In 2015 , American Heart Association , AHA , report heart disease statistic estimate 5.7 million Americans age 20 heart failure . Heart failure increasingly prevalent due age population increase major cardiovascular risk factor , include obesity diabetes . The AHA also estimate one five adult develop heart failure age 40 . During heart failure progression , heart steadily lose ability respond increase metabolic demand , mild exercise soon exceed heart 's ability maintain adequate output . Towards end stage disease , heart pump enough blood meet body 's needs rest . At stage , fluid accumulate extremity lung make patient bedridden unable perform activity daily live . The long-term prognosis associate heart failure approximately 50 % mortality five year follow initial diagnosis . CardiAMP comprehensive therapeutic treatment comprises ( ) point care cell processing platform , ( ii ) biotherapeutic delivery system . CardiAMP first comprehensive therapeutic treatment utilize patient 's cell treatment ischemic systolic heart failure , heart failure develop heart attack . In screen process , physician extract small sample patient 's bone marrow outpatient procedure perform local anesthesia . The clinic sends sample centralized diagnostic lab , test sample . During treatment , clinician harvest prepare patient 's bone marrow mononuclear cell , autologous cell , use CardiAMP point care cell processing platform , cardiologist delivers heart use Helix biotherapeutic delivery system . BioCardia intend submit data obtain clinical trial Pre-Market Approval Application United States Food Drug Administration</detailed_description>
