	<brief_title>Vitamin D Mortality : Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis Standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D involve regulation calcium homeostasis exert beneficial effect skeletal health . Serum level 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 [ OH ] D ) measure assess vitamin D status , mainly determine sunlight ( ultraviolet-B ) induce vitamin D production skin , less extent , dietary supplemental vitamin D intake . A poor vitamin D status emerge risk factor various adverse health outcome include mortality , exist controversy classification vitamin D status shape association 25 ( OH ) D concentration mortality . Existing knowledge vitamin D status mortality limit miss standardization laboratory method . Previous study show assay laboratory difference significant impact report 25 ( OH ) D concentration thus association 25 ( OH ) D health outcome . Therefore , Vitamin D Standardization Program ( VDSP ) , collaborative initiative lead National Institutes Health-Office Dietary Supplements ( NIH-ODS ) , develop protocol standardize 25 ( OH ) D data current previous survey . In work , part EU-project 'Food-based solution eradication vitamin D deficiency health promotion throughout life cycle ' ( ODIN ) , aim address knowledge gap association standardize 25 ( OH ) D concentration mortality collaborative meta-analysis use individual participant data ( IPD ) eight study cohort across Europe . In detail , study association 25 ( OH ) D all-cause , cardiovascular , cancer mortality . We use one step approach meta-analysis , advantage IPD study model simultaneously whereas conventional two step approach base aggregate data individual study . Considering majority individual study meta-analysis already report original 25 ( OH ) D data aim compare original standardized 25 ( OH ) D concentration regard difference report concentration association mortality . Methods STUDY IDENTIFICATION &amp; SELECTION We establish collaboration undertake meta-analysis IPD . Potential participant work-package EU Seventh Framework programme ODIN invite attend one-day workshop Amsterdam November 2012 discus aim , implementation development task . Invited European-based participant identify basis recently publish data large prospective cohort vitamin D mortality cardiovascular outcomes . There number prerequisite inclusion individual cohort study ODIN : It necessary quality bio-banked sample uniform sample analysis select sample , validate prospective data clinical outcome , willingness collaborate expertise field . STUDIES &amp; PARTICIPANTS All individual cohort part ODIN Consortium . We use IPD eight independent prospective cohort study Norway , Germany , Denmark , Netherlands Iceland . Included study 4th survey Tromsø study , Ludwigshafen Risk Cardiovascular Health Study ( LURIC ) , Age , Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study ( AGES ) , New Hoorn Study ( NHS ) , Aarhus Mammography Cohort Study , German Health Interview Examination Survey Adults ( DEGS ) old young cohort Longitudinal Study Ageing Amsterdam ( LASA ) . All cohort study conduct accordance declaration Helsinki write informed consent obtain study participant . MEASUREMENT OF 25 ( OH ) D According VDSP protocol conduct sample procedure select subset 100-150 bio-banked serum sample individual cohort study re-analysis 25 ( OH ) D standardize certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-tandem MS ) method , traceable United States National Institute Standards Technology ( NIST ) high order Reference Measurement Procedure . The re-analysed 25 ( OH ) D value use develop master regression equation every present cohort study re-calibrate exist 25 ( OH ) D measurement . The NHS previous 25 ( OH ) D measurement analyse full . GROUPING The IPD population divide seven group accord 25 ( OH ) D status baseline . The allocation individual one seven subgroup perform original standardized 25 ( OH ) D measurement . According Institute Medicine ( IOM ) report 2011 , thresholds 25 ( OH ) D group assign severely vitamin D deficient ( ≤29•99 nmol/L ) , two group patient risk inadequacy ( 30 ≤ 39•99 nmol/L 40 ≤ 49•99 nmol/L ) , vitamin D sufficient ( 50 ≤ 75 nmol/L ) , two group vitamin D level consistently associate increased benefit ( 75 ≤ 99•99 nmol/L ; 100 ≤ 124•99 nmol/L ) high vitamin D level reason concern ( ≥ 125 nmol/L ; convert nmol/L ng/mL divide 2•496 ) . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Differences original standardize 25 ( OH ) D concentration assess paired-sample t-test . For comparison baseline characteristic across baseline standardize vitamin D group , use ANOVA continuous χ2 test categorical data , appropriate . All-cause mortality primary outcome available participate cohort study . Secondary outcome cardiovascular mortality cancer mortality available cohort study except NHS . All endpoint seek great detail available death certificate , municipal registry , medical record local authority . All outcome analysis perform original standardized 25 ( OH ) D value mean IPD meta-analysis estimate study-specific estimate . The analysis base individual complete data age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , season blood sampling , 25 ( OH ) D level , vital status follow-up follow-up-time . Follow-up time &gt; 0 day . Participants miss data exclude analysis perform data imputation . Associations 25 ( OH ) D level all-cause mortality estimate use IPD one-step approach . In general , IPD meta-analyses follow one-step procedure show concise approach binary outcome compare frequently use two-step approach , aggregate data analyse . We use hierarchical , parametric survival model , feasible compare Cox model analyse binary outcome . The single equation process parametric , accelerated failure time ( AFT ) Weibull model , appear fit best underlie data exponential , log-logistic log-normal distribution . The model build use SAS PROC NLMIXED ( SAS Institute Inc. , 100 SAS Campus Drive , Cary , USA ) random intercept account random effect across cohort study . For mortality analysis , 25 ( OH ) D model use 1 ) traditional categorical variable approach group accord prior mention IOM classification , 2 ) restrict cubic spline approach . The cubic-splines approach chosen retain continuous nature 25 ( OH ) D value calculate hazard ratio ( HRs ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) mean value group . We choose 25 ( OH ) D group low mortality risk reference . Our outcome analyse cumulatively adjust risk factor mortality determinant vitamin D status . In model 1 adjust age ( year ) , sex ( male/female ) , season blood collection ( Spring , Summer , Autumn , Winter ) . In model 2 , main statistical model , additionally adjust BMI ( kg/m² ) . In model 3 , additionally adjust diabetes mellitus ( yes/no ) arterial hypertension ( yes/no ) , model 4 add history cancer ( yes/no ) , history cardiovascular disease ( yes/no ) current smoking status covariates ( yes/no ) . Additional adjustment model two reference model . Additional adjusting covariates available every cohort study , additional adjustment perform study provide covariates . First , supplemental intake calcium ( yes/no ) add model two . The first additional adjustment analysis wil perform study , DEGS LASA , young cohort , information supplemental usage available . Second , supplemental intake vitamin D ( yes/no ) add model two study LASA , old young cohort , DEGS , information supplemental usage vitamin D available study . Third , additional adjustment model two physical activity ( three dummy variable low , medium high frequency physical activity ) process study Aarhus mammography cohort . For sensitivity analysis , also leave DEGS , participant DEGS high proportion young , physically active individual . Fourth , adjustment estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ; mL/min/1•73m² ) add model two . The eGFR calculate creatinine baseline visit accord four-variable Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) Study equation add model two study NHS , creatinine measurement available NHS . In fifth analysis , adjustment parathyroid hormone ( pmol/L ) add model two study NHS , Aarhus mammography cohort LASA , young cohort . In sixth analysis , adjustment C-reactive protein ( mg/L ) add model two study NHS , Aarhus mammography cohort LASA , young cohort . In seventh analysis , adjustment systolic blood pressure ( mm Hg ) add model two study Aarhus mammography cohort , DEGS . In eighth analysis , adjustment low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( mmol/L ) add model two study Aarhus mammography cohort , DEGS . In ninth analysis , adjustment glucose ( mmol/L ) add model two study Tromsø Study , Aarhus mammography cohort , DEGS . All model original 25 ( OH ) D perform without NHS , NHS original 25 ( OH ) D measurement . For standardized 25 ( OH ) D , compute model 1 ) data NHS 2 ) without data NHS provide comparable result model original standardized 25 ( OH ) D measurement . Sensitivity Analyses Subgroup analyse perform stratify risk factor vitamin D deficiency mortality . In detail stratify sex ( females/males ) , age group ( &lt; 60 year ; 60 69•9 year ; 70+ year ) , BMI group ( &lt; 25 kg/m² ; 25 &lt; 30 kg/m² ; ≥30 kg/m² ) , calcium supplementation ( yes/no ) , vitamin D supplementation ( yes/no ) , history CVD ( yes/no ) , history cancer ( yes/no ) . A sensitivity analysis restrict individual die &gt; 1 year &gt; 3 year baseline examination restrict general population cohort ( i.e . cohort except LURIC ) . Secondary outcome To assess secondary outcome cardiovascular cancer mortality , utilize traditional Cox proportional hazard modify risk regression accord method Fine Gray account compete risk . In brief , proportional hazard may satisfy multi-centre setting , baseline hazard allow vary across single cohort study .</detailed_description>
