	<brief_summary>Nephrocalcinosis ( NC ) , define calcification renal tissue , report occur 7-41 % premature infant . Causes NC likely multi-factorial , infant bear prematurely low birth weight ( &lt; 1500 gm ) seem high risk develop NC . Recent change recommendation nutrition preterm infant high intake protein , calcium , vitamin D may also play factor pathogenesis NC . Currently , diagnosis NC often occur incidentally ultrasound evaluation issue . Because acute symptom pattern symptom preterm population associate specifically NC , possible many case NC may diagnose . Presently , impractical costly screen infant NC renal ultrasound , therefore standard care regard screen NC . NC may long-term effect . Studies show preterm infant NC shorter kidney low rate tubule resorption phosphorus ( TRP ) preterm infant without NC . This study analyze weekly urinalysis enrol subject prospectively look incidence NC discharge enrol subject .</brief_summary>
