	<detailed_description>The Oklahoma Family Health Patterns project intensive study psychological , behavioral , stress reactivity characteristic healthy young adult family history alcoholism ( FH+ ) goal identify characteristic place person elevate risk disorder . The investigator recently identify early life adverse experience ( ELA ) , include physical sexual abuse separation parent , occur disproportionate impact FH+ , investigator show ELA account diminish stress reactivity , behavioral impulsivity , poor mood regulation , risk factor alcohol substance use disorder . The impact ELA FH+ population demand study Gene x Environment interaction give know positive feedback FH+ ELA . The investigator ' goal carry G x E interaction study genotyping investigator ' FH x ELA examine impact genotype broad range personal characteristic currently study project . Aim 1 . Examine differential impact ELA psychological behavioral characteristic FH+ vs. FH- group use expanded sample volunteer . Aim 2 . Use investigator ' large sample carry Gene x Environment analysis test specific allele strongly suspect influencing activity brain motivational system , expand work investigator initiate NIAAA thanks supplement R01 ( AA012207-S1 ) . Aim 3 . Test specific aspect temperament endophenotypes link FH ELA behavioral , cognitive , stress reactivity aspects person 's phenotype . Aim 4 . Increase investigator ' recruitment base screen test volunteer second site , University Texas HSC , San Antonio , investigator currently conduct neuroimaging study . Alcoholism costly burden society , risk factor alcoholism poorly understood . The vast majority study focus alcoholic patient unable disentangle preexisting influence effect alcohol intake history . The investigator ' high-risk study design value contrast FH+ FH- regard environmental contributor genetic vulnerability contribute behavioral risk factor .</detailed_description>
