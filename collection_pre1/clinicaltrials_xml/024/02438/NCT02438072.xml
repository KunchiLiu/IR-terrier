	<detailed_description>- Objectives To describe drug metabolism variability depressive patient use phenotypic approach - Study design Prospective , clinical , naturalistic , descriptive study During consultation clinician , depressive patient receive information . During visit V0 investigator : patient include : - Verification inclusion non inclusion criterion - Reminder participation condition - Inclusion , signature consent - Collection clinical demographic feature Between V0 V1 , patient change antidepressant therapy , take place telephone interview every two week , conduct clinician evaluate treatment depression response ( tolerance efficacy ) During visit V1 , take place : - Phenotypic study - Genetic study - Dosage current antidepressant drug - Clinical evaluation : efficacy tolerance - Number patient During one year , protocol propose patient depression decision change antidepressant therapy , patient stability od prescription since almost 6 week . The inclusion approximately 100 patient expect . - Name finish product Zyban® , Froben® , Antra® , Bexine® , Dormicum® Telfast® - Name active substance Omeprazole ( 10 mg , A02BC01 ) Caffeine ( 50 mg , N06BC01 ) Flurbiprofen ( 10 mg , M01AE09 ) Dextromethorphan ( 10 mg , R05DA09 ) Midazolam ( 1 mg , N05CD08 ) Fexofenadine ( 25mg , R06AX26 ) Bupropion ( 20 mg , N06AX12 ) - Duration treatment One time study , one day ( Visit 1 ) - Time plan research -Duration patient : The study stop patient perform V1 study Minimal delay V0 V1 : 6 week ( 5-7 week ) : patient decision change treatment , 5 day patient stability treatment since almost 6 week . Maximal delay participation patient : 4 month even V1 perform -Overall duration inclusion : one year Maximal overall duration study : 12 months+4 months= 16 month Maximal duration analytical study since begin study= 16 months+6 month : 22 month . Maximal delay communication result : 2 year begin study</detailed_description>
