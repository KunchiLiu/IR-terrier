	<detailed_description>30 patient prescribed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) therapy treatment major depressive disorder recruit study . Prior undergoing rTMS , patient give small blood sample . An additional blood sample give upon completion rTMS treatment . 30 healthy control individual also recruit provide one-time blood sample comparison . Control individual receive rTMS treatment . Blood sample analyse level Oxidized Phosphatidylcholines . The investigator wish determine whether difference pre-treatment level stress marker individual ultimately respond rTMS . Additionally , investigator wish determine whether change stress marker result rTMS treatment .</detailed_description>
