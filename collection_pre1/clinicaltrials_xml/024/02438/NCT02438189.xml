	<brief_summary>Objective : gain experience in-home use modify algorithm dose insulin minimize project hyperglycemia overnight addition suspend pump hypoglycemia project overnight obtain feasibility , safety , initial efficacy data . Study Design : randomize controlled trial , randomization night level within subject . Major Eligibility Criteria : clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes , daily insulin therapy least one year insulin infusion pump least 6 month ; 15.0 &lt; 46.0 year age ; HbA1c &lt; 10.0 % ; DKA last 6 month ; hypoglycemic seizure loss consciousness last 6 month ; Living significant family member ( `` companion '' ) commit participate study activity , present available provide assistance system use night . Sample Size : 30 subject . Study Duration Visit Schedule : duration approximately 3 month , preliminary run-in activity follow 90 day spend clinical trial phase study ; clinic visit enrollment , follow CGM system assessment run-in phase , start clinical trial phase , 21-day point clinical trial phase , 42 night successful system use . Major Efficacy Outcomes : - Primary : time range ( 70-180 mg/dl , 3.9-10.0 mmol/L ) overnight . - Secondary : time spend hypoglycemia ( ≤70 mg/dl , 3.9 mmol/L ) time spend hyperglycemia ( &gt; 180 mg/dl , 10.0 mmol/L ) overnight . Major Safety Outcomes : CGM measure hypo- hyperglycemia , include morning blood glucose mean overnight sensor glucose ; adverse event include severe hypoglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects eligible clinical trial initially use Veo insulin pump Enlite 2 CGM sensor home minimum 6 days/week 2-week period verify subject able use CGM insert sensor . The first 10 subject enrolled participate 2-day overnight hotel-based pilot , collect total 20 night data experience system transitional hotel setting . The DSMB review safety data 20 night hotel-based pilot study make recommendation regard proceed at-home portion study . Following DSMB review approval safety data hotel study , first 10 subject participate Algorithm Assessment Phase approximately 10 night Predictive Low Glucose Suspend ( PLGS ) + Hyper Minimization system use ( nominal total 100 night use home ) determine adjustment algorithm parameter need safe advance randomize clinical trial phase . If adjustment need , Algorithm Assessment Phase repeat , use 10 subject possible . Once randomized clinical trial phase begin , approximately 200 night randomize system use collect assessed safety DSMB proceeding . New subject enroll study completion Algorithm Assessment Phase use PLGS+Hyper Minimization closed-loop system home least 5 day demonstrate ability use system submit study data Coordinating Center . Subjects successfully demonstrate ability use system home describe eligible randomized trial phase . This phase consist use full system home approximately 42 night : - Each night blood glucose level check BG meter use perform calibration CGM . This calibration must occur 90 minute prior activation system . NOTE : Subjects instruct calibrate CGM per manufacturer guideline . - Then system activate , link CGM insulin pump computer bedside . - A randomization schedule laptop use determine whether system run PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode PLGS-only . - Subjects blind whether system run PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode PLGS-only . - There alarm pump shuts automate insulin dose occurs . The CGM alarm set 60 mg/dL ( 3.3 mmol/L ) . When CGM alarm occurs , subject ask measure blood glucose BG meter , he/she aware alarm . - The time period outcome assessment night time system activate turned morning . - Pump shut , occur , 120 minute 150-minute period , 180 minute entire night . Multiple instance pump suspension occur recurrent prediction hypoglycemia night . - Small correction bolus insulin delivered system predict hyperglycemia pre-set threshold occur , insulin-on-board constraint cumulative delivery limit minimize likelihood excessive insulin delivery . - Subjects ask check blood glucose study BG meter morning prior breakfast enter result use controller software interface . The subject instruct contact study physician morning blood glucose value &lt; 60 mg/dl ( 3.3 mmol/L ) &gt; 300 mg/dl ( 16.7 mmol/L ) . Monitoring process detailed section 3.11 ensure subject contact value report required range . - Subjects ask record overnight carbohydrate intake use controller software interface . - Subjects ask perform periodic CGM data uploads use controller software interface . Monitoring process ensure subject contact uploads occur require , review upload reveals extreme , prolong episode hypoglycemia hyperglycemia , elevate morning blood glucose value . Upon completion study , subject well study clinician ask complete human factor usability questionnaire regard use study system .</detailed_description>
