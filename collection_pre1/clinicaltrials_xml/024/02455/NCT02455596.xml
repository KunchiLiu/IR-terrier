	<brief_title>Recombinant Anti-tumor Anti-virus Protein Injection Treat Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase Ⅱ exploratory clinical study . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection treat patient advanced neuroendocrine tumor fail standard treatment unable receive standard treatment . Recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection , 10μg , im,3 time first week , follow 20μg two week , follow maintenance dose 30μg , frequency administration three time per week . Treatment continue patient die unacceptable toxicity disease progression require discontinue treatment . At time disease progression , investigator believe patient continue benefit investigational product , patient may provide recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection , survival follow-up data record .</detailed_description>
