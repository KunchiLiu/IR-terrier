	<brief_title>Fenofibrate Treatment SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although consider modifiable risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) general population , magnitude physical activity require promote cardiorespiratory fitness clinically meaningful change blood-derived biomarkers CAD achievable severe physical disability , immobilize paralysis spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . During chronic phase SCI , characteristic dyslipidemia emerges , mean serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentration &lt; 40 mg/dl , threshold level HDL-C appreciate independent risk factor CAD , elevation triglyceride ( TG ) concentration , near , target value general population trigger clinical intervention , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration within normal range . It surprise cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) -related morbidity person SCI occur early life , great prevalence general population , primary cause death first year injury . Population-based epidemiological study unavailable clinical guidance relatively low incidence rate SCI . Clinical target value use initiate treatment general population may inappropriate SCI unique pathophysiology . In absence significant physical activity lifestyle modification , would seem appropriate pharmaceutical option need properly manage marker CVD-related risk person SCI . To date , limited empirical evidence support use lipid-lowering treatment person SCI . Fenofibrate fibric acid derivate activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor lipoprotein lipase , lead enhanced elimination TG plasma . In clinical trial fenofibrate use monotherapy , serum TG concentration fell 41-53 % , low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) fell 38-52 % , LDL-C decrease 6-20 % , HDL-C improve much 20 % . In consideration nature dyslipidemia person SCI , fenofibrate appear appropriate first-line agent treatment cohort , especially SCI LDL value within clinically acceptable range . In general population , standard clinical practice lipid-lowering treatment fenofibrate monotherapy follow know clinically accepted timeline monitor safety determine therapeutic efficacy . It recommend , 2 month continuous therapy beneficial change lipoprotein profile , treatment discontinue ( i.e. , non-responders ) . Similarly , several large clinical trial demonstrate peak therapeutic effect fenofibrate observe 12-16 week treatment ( i.e. , responder ) . The propose study test efficacy administer fenofibrate person SCI , severely immobilized cohort establish clinical practice guideline treat dyslipidemia appear unique consideration may hypothesize call disease-specific approach care . If successful , treatment reduce clinical marker CVD-related risk modify concentration number particle know contribute incident cardiac event mortality . It anticipate insight gain investigation provide clinicians proof-of-concept institute appropriate use lipid lower agent treat dyslipidemia well described person SCI .</detailed_description>
