	<brief_summary>Breathlessness , sensation breathe discomfort , major problem people chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Breathlessness persist despite optimal management underlie disease ( ) say refractory . Preliminary evidence suggest small , regular dose morphine help reduce safely sensation breathlessness . However , research morphine breathlessness define best way adjust dose medication , refine people likely benefit , response side effect . This randomized , double-blind phase III trial people COPD significant refractory breathlessness , explore several important question : - Are regular , low dose opioids ( morphine ) four possible dos 3 week effective placebo medication ( contain active ingredient ) improve breathlessness ? - Does medication effect daily activity , breathlessness , quality life ? - What common side effect intervention ? - Does benefit drug outweigh side effect produce ? - Are specific characteristic people likely receive benefit sustain release morphine ? Participants allocate receive three week morphine sulfate ( laxative , docusate senna ) , placebo ( placebo laxative ) . The dose morphine may increase week week two three . All medicine appear ( blind ) neither doctor participant know medication participant receiving . Participants medical interview , physical examination collect general health information , baseline measurement include ; daily activity , symptom , quality life . A small amount blood may require check eligibility . Further blood sample may take week 1 3 enable test individual respond opioids , consent obtain sample . Data benefit , side effect , medical care collect comprehensive weekly visit . Participants also fill simple diary twice daily week one three study , one day week optional 3 month extension stage . The outcome study may enable good management symptoms activity people COPD medicine show effective safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioids Refractory Breathlessness Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Three hundred thousand ( 300,000 ) Australians breathless rest minimal exertion , often year , despite optimal treatment underlie cause ( ) . This include 70,000 people breathless leave home often long periods time . Underlying cause severe ongoing breathlessness include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , interstitial lung disease , heart failure , neurodegenerative disease motor neurone disease cachexia cause . The prevalence chronic refractory breathlessness continue increase population age chronic progressive disease breathlessness common increase prevalence . Nearly one half people experience distress breathlessness last year life . The American Thoracic Society define breathlessness `` subjective experience breathe discomfort consist qualitatively distinct sensation vary intensity '' . The term 'dyspnoea ' use interchangeably breathlessness , shortness breath , breathe difficulty labour breathe . Internationally , medication register symptomatic reduction chronic refractory breathlessness despite recommendation American Thoracic Society , American College Physicians , Canadian Thoracic Society American College Chest Physicians regular , low-dose morphine evidence-based pharmaceutical option . Aim : To enhance evidence base pharmacological treatment chronic refractory breathlessness use potential therapy compare placebo . Primary objective : To compare difference net clinical effect ( benefit side effect ) chronic refractory breathlessness people chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) take daily , sustained release morphine two different dos compare placebo . Secondary objective . 1 . Are regular , low dose oral opioids safe , include dose titrate upwards , population people refractory breathlessness COPD ? 2 . Do people whose breathlessness help regular , low dose oral morphine get additional benefit increase dose morphine ? 3 . Over period time benefit continue increase dose level benefit achieve ? 4 . What percentage people derive clinically significant benefit four dosing level placebo ? 5 . At low dos , evidence benefit last full 24 hour ? ( end-of-dose failure ) 6 . Can predict response , benefit side effect baseline demographic clinical data 7 . Does treatment breathlessness regular , low dose morphine effect general health status quality life ? 8 . Determine change activity daily live treat opioids compare placebo . 9 . Assess effect treatment anxiety depression . 10 . Understand long term benefit side effect sustain release morphine people COPD compare placebo . 11 . Do participant , still blind , preference end three week study ? Sub-studies 1 . Identify pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter may help predict individual achieve great benefit week one therapy ( 8mg/day , 16mg/day ) . 2 . Identify pharmacogenomic variation opioid receptor signal may help predict clinical response ( benefit , side effect response ) . 3 . Study effect sleep people participate study 4 . Compare within trial incremental cost cost effectiveness therapy 5 . Evaluate change total testosterone baseline end three month extension . Null hypothesis : In people COPD refractory breathlessness , difference breathlessness intensity addition regular , low dose oral sustain release morphine compare placebo . Alternative hypothesis : The addition regular , low dose oral sustain release morphine reduces intensity breathlessness people COPD occur safely . Study design : A five stage , national , multi-site , double-blind , parallel arm , block randomise , placebo control factorial ( dose increment ) phase III study opioids chronic refractory breathlessness people COPD : Stage 0 - baseline ( 2 day ) ; Stage 1 - randomisation # 1 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 2 - randomisation # 2 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 3 - randomisation # 3 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 4 - optional blind extension arm ( 3 month ) . Stage 0 . Baseline assessment : All consent participant complete 2 full day baseline diary ( morning evening ) order become accustom complete diary regularly provide stable baseline data regard breathlessness , symptom function ( measure activPALR actigraphy ) . At completion 2 day , participant review , complete remain baseline assessment ( questionnaire , measure baseline safety data ) , eligible randomise first time . Time period : Two full day ( 4 diary entry ) Stage 1 . Randomisation # 1 : Randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg KapanolR OR 16mg KapanolR . Twice daily diary . Participants randomise KapanolR also receive blind docusate sennosides , randomise placebo receive identical placebo . This primary outcome ( end point ) study . Time period : 1 week Stage 2 . Randomisation # 2 : While continue arm assign Stage 1 , add randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg KapanolR . Twice daily diary . Participants randomise placebo Stage 1 KapanolR Stage 2 blind docusate sennosides replace placebo . Time period : 1 week Stage 3 . Randomisation # 3 : While continue arm assign Stages 1 2 , add third randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg KapanolR . Twice daily diary . activPALR accelerometer worn week . Participants randomise placebo Stages 1 2 KapanolR Stage 3 blind docusate sennosides replace placebo . Time period : 1 week Stage 4 . Extension ( optional individual participant ) : Continue double blind medication Stages 1 , 2 3 three month . Diary one day week . A blood test end three month take total testosterone level . Time period : 3 month . Target population : This study people optimally treated people mild , moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Primary outcome assessment : Change baseline average intensity breathlessness previous 24 hour , measure morning 11 point numerical rating scale . Significance : The study answer several practical question include whether opioids net benefit people COPD reduce refractory breathlessness , whether dose increase beyond initial response provide great net benefit , pattern symptomatic response day successful titration , proportion people derive clinically meaningful symptomatic benefit dose level . Analysis plan : All analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis . All analysis conduct Stata version 13.1 . Missing data impute use multiple imputation 50 resamples draw . The primary comparison study power end week 1 : placebo compare 8mg KapanolR daily ; placebo compare 16mg KapanolR daily . Change breathlessness first week group evaluate use random effect mixed model . Sample size calculation : All calculation assume Type I ( familywise error rate ( FWER ) ) error rate 5 % Type II error rate 20 % ( power 80 % ) respectively . In order account attrition 20 % end week 1 , study recruit 144*100/ ( 100-20 ) = 180 subject .</detailed_description>
