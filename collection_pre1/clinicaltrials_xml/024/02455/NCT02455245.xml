	<brief_summary>This study try learn understand chemotherapy drug call carboplatin work well standard therapy . The standard therapy Low Grade Glioma ( LGG ) child young adult use combination carboplatin vincristine . Studies child show use carboplatin alone promise effective treat LGG standard therapy . Additionally , study try understand treatment carboplatin alone associate improve quality life LGG patient family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Two Carboplatin Containing Regimens Children Young Adults With Previously Untreated Low Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low grade glioma common central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor pediatric population . They consist heterogeneous group tumor classify World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade I II . This include astrocytic , oligodendroglial , neuronal mixed glial- neuronal tumor . The clinical behavior tumor varies accord location histology . The cerebellum common location low grade glioma , also arise cerebrum , deep midline structure hypothalamus , optic pathway , less frequently , brainstem . Although etiology childhood LGG unknown , patient Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF-1 ) one rare group predispose develop CNS tumor . NF-1 inherited disorder affect nervous system , eye skin . In addition , child increase risk develop optic pathway hypothalamic low grade glioma . Fifteen to-20 % NF-1 patient develop tumor , account 70 % tumor see location . In half patient NF-1 optic pathway tumor , patient symptomatic mass find incidentally . Many optic glioma NF-1 patient follow indolent course stabilize without intervention . Patients commonly treat deterioration vision symptomatic increase tumor size . Although event free survival ( EFS ) report similar NF1 non-NF1 patient , overall survival high NF1 patient . Location , affect extent surgical resection , play key role prognosis patient low grade glioma . Complete surgical resection offer 90 % survival rate 10 year often need adjuvant chemotherapy radiation . Unfortunately , gross total resection always possible due location tumor proximity vital structure brain . In patient incomplete resection , 10 year EFS 74 % radiation treatment . However , toxicity radiation , especially young child , significant include neurocognitive delay , endocrinopathies , secondary malignancy , ototoxicity vasculopathy . Therefore , expert agree standard care young child treat low grade glioma require adjuvant therapy surgical resection/biopsy , whose tumor surgically resectable chemotherapy first , order delay avoid radiation . This especially true child NF-1 , risk secondary malignancy radiation therapy high 50 % lifetime child .</detailed_description>
