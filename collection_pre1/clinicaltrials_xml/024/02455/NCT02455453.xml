	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate uptake radioactive tracer 21-18F-fluoro-16α,17α- [ ( R ) - ( 1'-α-furylmethylidene ) dioxy ] -19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ( FFNP ) uptake , bind breast cancer progesterone receptor ( PgRs ) PET/CT scan administration estradiol one day ( estrogen challenge ) determine change uptake predictor response endocrine therapy ( ET ) patient hormone-sensitive estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ( HER2- ) breast cancer . Estradiol potent naturally occur estrogen , administer treat menopausal symptom also sometimes treat metastatic breast cancer . The investigator propose study patient biopsy-proven newly diagnose , locally advanced , metastatic , recurrent breast cancer go treated endocrine therapy ( ET ) ( tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor fulvestrant standard care therapy . Subjects undergo total two FFNP-PET/CT scan ; one second one immediately follow one day estradiol challenge start standard care ET . The estradiol challenge consist administer total 6 mg estradiol orally ( three dose 2 mg ) give approximately 8 hour interval 24 hour period .</brief_summary>
