	<brief_title>Factors Associated With Perioperative Outcomes Non-emergency Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study identify prior stroke , heart attack current diabetes mellitus anaemia important risk factor adverse outcome follow surgery . Recent heart attack associate great risk old one . While recent data suggest new stroke impart significantly great risk old stroke , lack concordance literature , despite plausibility finding . Despite knowledge prior pneumonia long-term health risk , lack data whether prior pneumonia influence perioperative risk whether time interval pneumonia surgery affect relationship . Furthermore diabetes mellitus anaemia know important perioperative risk factor , relationship haemoglobin concentration HbA1c level perioperative outcome unclear . The aim epidemiological study explore association perioperative risk United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( linkage Hospital Episode Statistics data Office National Statistics mortality data ) . The research aim : 1 . To investigate association three recent acute medical event ( stroke , pneumonia MI ) adverse perioperative outcome follow non-cardiac cardiac surgery . 2 . To investigate association time-elapsed acute medical event ( stroke , pneumonia MI ) adverse perioperative outcome follow non-cardiac cardiac surgery . 3 . To investigate numerical risk threshold haemoglobin HbA1c could predict adverse perioperative outcome follow non-cardiac cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
