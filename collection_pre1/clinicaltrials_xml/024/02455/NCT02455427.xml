	<brief_summary>Stroke second cause death worldwide represent first cause death Brazil 2006 2010 . Most patient survive , need develop cost-effective rehabilitation strategy decrease burden disability stroke . This study address important issue , evaluate , early phase post-stroke , effect motor conventional physical therapy associate transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Subacute Phase After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator main goal confirm safety transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) associate conventional physical therapy , compare conventional physical therapy associate sham tDCS , upper limb rehabilitation early phase ( 72 hour 6 week ) stroke . Patients randomize receive one two treatment , 3 time per week , 2 week . Adverse effect monitor session . The work hypothesis conventional physical therapy associate active tDCS subacute phase ischemic stroke safe conventional therapy alone . The investigator also preliminarily evaluate efficacy active tDCS associate conventional therapy , compare conventional therapy alone , improvement upper limb motor impairment . The investigator secondary goal : 1 ) To compare effect mention intervention disability , spasticity quality life , patient early stage stroke ( subacute phase ) , immediately treatment 3 month later . The investigator hypothesis association conventional physical therapy active tDCS lead well outcomes conventional therapy alone . Patients assess first session last session treatment , well 3 month last session treatment . Preliminary data structural functional connectivity collect order plan future study relate mechanism tDCS subacute phase stroke .</detailed_description>
