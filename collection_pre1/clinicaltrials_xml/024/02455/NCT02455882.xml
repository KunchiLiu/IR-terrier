The majority remainder patient stage II III disease undergo treatment adjuvant chemotherapy either clinical protocol standard care . There subset woman ER positive disease receive chemotherapy favorable tumor characteristic . This tissue procurement protocol design systematically collect tissue , urine blood specimen patient undergo neoadjuvant systemic therapy adjuvant chemotherapy , serially follow treatment , and/or time disease recurrence order investigate mechanism underlie development metastatic disease , identify predictor response resistance therapy , test potential new therapy breast cancer use combination patient-derived xenograft creation new microfluidic technology .</brief_summary>
