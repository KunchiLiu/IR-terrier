	<brief_title>Safety Study Disrupted Adenovirus ( Ad ) Serotype Cocaine Vaccine Cocaine-dependent Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I dose-ranging , placebo-controlled , double blind study assess safety preliminary efficacy anti-cocaine vaccine call `` dAd5GNE vaccine '' . The vaccine design prevent cocaine reach brain . The vaccine comprise GNE , cocaine-like molecule link capsid protein disrupt serotype 5 adenovirus . The vaccine use evoke `` immunity '' prevent cocaine reach brain . The vaccine evoke immune system response stimulate creation anti-cocaine antibody . The antibody bind cocaine molecule person take cocaine prevents cocaine molecule reach brain . This cocaine-antibody complex able cross blood brain barrier thus eliminate effect cocaine brain , see pre-clinical study do group . In mouse , rat nonhuman primate , vaccine evoke persistent , high titer , high affinity IgG anti-cocaine antibody response . The pre-clinical study conduct establish efficacy high anti-cocaine antibody titer . The immunity sequesters parenterally administer cocaine blood , mouse , rat nonhuman primate ( Appendix I-III ) . For subject , study take place period 32 week time first vaccine administration , enroll cocaine addict , define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 5th edition , Text Revisions ( DSM-V-TR ) , choose discontinue cocaine use abstinent least 7 day less 60 day . Based recommendation FDA , entire trial carry cocaine addict remain drug free . All subject undergo standard drug dependency therapy parallel participation study .</detailed_description>
