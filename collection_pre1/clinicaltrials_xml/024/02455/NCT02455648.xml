	<detailed_description>Aim Our aim evaluate mucosal wound heal endoscopic resection early cancer pre-cancerous lesion esophagus enhance transplantation autologous cell sheet , thus reduce risk esophageal stenosis . Background Adenocarcinoma Barrett 's esophagus The incidence esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) increase rapidly western world last decade . The reason increase unknown , however , strong association risk develop EAC gastro esophageal reflux . Chronic reflux may lead Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) , condition squamous epithelium esophagus replace columnar epithelium ( 1 ) . BE premalignant condition lifetime risk progress EAC 5 % men 3 % woman ( 2 ) . The rate progression dependent grade dysplasia BE . One meta-analysis show low-grade dysplasia cancer incidence 17/1,000 patient-years high-grade dysplasia incidence 66/1,000 patient-years ( 3 ) . Medical treatment reduce reflux symptom , proof decrease risk progression . Treatment High-grade dysplasia The American Gastroenterological Association guideline recommend patient high-grade dysplasia treat surgical resection , endoscopic therapy offer surveillance endoscopy every 3 month ( 4 ) . The Japanese Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( JGSE ) describe endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) suitable BE high-grade dysplasia give diameter ≤2 cm , &lt; 1/3 esophageal circumference limit mucosa . One several advantage EMR resect mucosa examine histologically , compare ablative therapy . Briefly , EMR perform submucosal injection separate esophageal wall layer resection mucosa snare . A similar technique endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) also include submucosal injection , instead use snare resecting , lesion dissect cut instrument , insulation-tipped ( IT ) knife . Another approach radiofrequency ablation use cylindrical balloon electrode attach . One study show complete eradication 81.0 % high-grade dysplasia patient . Using ablation technique , tissue-samples possible collect histology might also risk bury Barrett 's metaplasia dysplasia progress . Complications radiofrequency ablation include chest pain , upper gastrointestinal bleeding stenosis formation ( 4 ) . Moreover , patient undergo ablation therapy require life-long surveillance endoscopy ( 5 ) . Early esophageal cancer The best curative treatment early adenocarcinoma esophagus consider esophagectomy extended lymphadenectomy ( 3 ) . Esophagectomy extensive surgical procedure mortality rate range 4.9- 18.0 % risk serious post-operative complication range 26-41 % ( 6 ) . There also frequently occur post-operative complaint reflux , diarrhea dysphagia ( 3 ) . Endoscopic therapy modality initially reserve patient HGD use alternative open surgery early esophageal cancer . Although practice pioneer Asia , increasingly practice Europe US ( 7 ) . Early cancer classify M1 ( limited epithelial layer ) M2 ( invade lamina propria ) may good candidate endoscopic therapy associate lymph node metastasis ( 4 ) . Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) two resective technique remove mucosal tissue esophagus ( 8 ) . EMR , resection mucosa perform snare separation mucosa muscularis propria submucosal injection saline hyaloronic acid injection reserve lesion &lt; 15 mm diameter ( 8 ) . Larger lesion remove call piece meal resection , risk incomplete resection subsequent local recurrence substantial ( 9 ) . With ESD , submucosal dissection perform lifting delineation lesion full-thickness mucosal circumferential cut much large lesion remove en bloc , reduce risk incomplete resection ( 8 , 9 ) . Complications EMR ESD A common complication EMR ESD stenosis esophagus result dysphagia . Mucosal defect large ¾ esophageal circumference strongly associate development stenosis . This treated repetitive balloon dilatation . Takahashi et al retrospectively analyzed 437 patient treated EMR/ESD . 90 patient mucosal defect &gt; ¾ esophageal circumference , 70 develop stricture require dilatation ( 1-45 dilatation per patient dilatation treatment time 1-51 month ) . During dilatation therapy 7 perforation 1 bleeding occur ( 9 ) . Cell sheet transplantation In 2006 , Ohki et al publish article prevent inflammation aggressive endoscopic resection . Scarring stenosis esophagus cause severe inflammation . In canine model try improve wound heal reduce constriction . They create transplantable cell sheet autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell ( OMEC ) . In six animal esophageal ulcer create ESD . In three animal , two cell sheet transplant . Neither group show stricture , probably owe thicker muscle layer dog . However , study show transplant group enhance wound heal less inflammation . The result imply cell sheet transplantation could potentially prevent stenosis extensive mucosal resection . The cell cover whole ulcer , secretion growth factor cytokines believe accelerated heal native tissue . The harvest cell sheet still intact extra cellular matrix may act glue tissue , make suture unnecessary ( 10 ) . With background mention study Ohki et al perform feasibility study human ( unpublished data ) , thus far show promising result ( direct communication Dr Ohki ) . Project description Study design Part 1 A feasibility study patient early adenocarcinoma HGD Barrett 's mucosa endoscopic resection clinically indicate . Part 2 A randomized control trial compare ESD/EMR without cell sheet transplantation ESD/EMR cell sheet transplantation respect mucosal wound heal time stricture formation . Endpoints 1 . Primary endpoint : time complete wound heal 2 . Secondary endpoint : esophageal stricture occurrence , inflammatory response measure CellVizio , quality life questionnaire ( QLQ-OES18 ) Patients Inclusion criterion : Patients intramucosal adenocarcinoma high grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus endoscopic resection indicate accordance clinical guideline . Exclusion criterion : Inability give inform consent due mental disorder , language barrier etc . Power calculation : Study part 1 : The feasibility study Western patient adenocarcinoma , 10 patient recruit . No formal power calculation make feasibility study . Study part 2 : Based result Japanese feasibility study wound heal x % rapid among cell sheet transplant patient compare expect healing time without transplantation . Assuming difference healing time 30 % , base Japanese data 12 patient would require group obtain power 80 % alpha= 0.05 . Preparation transplantation cell sheet Isolation culture oral mucosal epithelial cell ( OMEC ) The patient ' oral cavity sterilize iodine ( ? ? ) local anesthesia administer inside cheek . A 5 mm punch biopsy take wound suture . The biopsy treat dispase separate epithelial cell , expose trypsin create single-cell suspension . The single-cell suspension seed temperature-responsive cell dish insert culture two week . No animal bacterial derive material use culturing . Harvesting cell sheet When endoscopists approximate 40 minute leave ESD investigator put dish 20°C incubator 30 minute . The cell sheet transfer support membrane transplant esophageal ulcer endoscopic forceps . A light pressure apply improve attachment . Depending size ulcer , several cell sheet transplant described manner . Follow-up Weekly gastroscopy Cellvizio . Weekly blood sample - ( CRP , interleukins , Blood status ) Quality Life questionnaire ( EORTC C30 OES18 ) Outcome measure : 1 . Healing measure endoscopically visualise photo-documenting completely intact mucosa weekly gastroscopy . Along endoscopical picture , grade heal base confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) develop , pilot study ( first part study ) demonstrate feasibility . 2 . Post-operative stenosis assess easy passage standard 9 mm endoscope area resection week 1-4 three-monthly interval . Additionally , standard questionnaire use . Dysphagia part EORTC OES18 module . Relevance The investigator hop study help u identify method prevent stenosis esophagus EMR/ESD . The stenosis commonly cause dysphagia seriously reduce quality life also could pose threat malnourishment .</detailed_description>
