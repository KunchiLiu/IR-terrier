	<detailed_description>The objective study define impact variable level PEEP tidal volume hemodynamics lung mechanic around delayed sternal closure Stage 1 palliation single ventricle patient . The Specific Aims work : Specific Aim 1 : Evaluate hemodynamics lung mechanic across range PEEP ( 2-12 cm H2O ) chest closure , maintain consistent ventilation , infant single ventricle physiology undergo delay sternal closure Stage 1 palliation surgery . Specific Aim 2 : Evaluate hemodynamics lung mechanic across range tidal volume ( 6-15ml/kg ) chest closure , maintain consistent ventilation , infant single ventricle physiology undergo delay sternal closure Stage 1 palliation surgery . Hypotheses 1 . The effect PEEP tidal volume hemodynamics lung mechanic significantly different sternal closure . We expect little effect PEEP tidal volume sternum remain open . Once sternum close , hypothesize shunt single ventricle physiology optimal oxygen delivery lung mechanic modest PEEP tidal volume ( U-shaped curve ) . Rationale : Delayed sternal closure commonly use prevent tissue tamponade promote favorable hemodynamics critically ill patient follow surgery congenital heart disease . This technique frequently employ shunt single ventricle physiology ( i.e.- Norwood patient ) . While several study show sternal closure associate temporary hemodynamic change stiffer lung mechanic , prospective study impact different ventilator strategy hemodynamics , lung mechanic sternal closure . Because patient generally among fragile postoperative patient , critical understand specific ventilator strategy help mitigate negative hemodynamic consequence chest closure . The purpose study understand critical cardiopulmonary interaction occur delay sternal closure population , determine optimal approach mechanical ventilation different circumstance . Cardiopulmonary interaction differ base underlying cardiac anatomy physiology . Most study cardiopulmonary interaction follow surgery congenital heart disease examine difference positive negative pressure ventilation right ventricular restrictive physiology tetralogy Fallot repair , cavopulmonary connection surgery . This work consistently show improvement cardiac output pulmonary blood flow negative pressure ventilation . It practical , however , maintain negative pressure ventilation sternum remain open even clear cardiopulmonary interaction play absence significant elastic recoil force chest wall . Similarly , patient leave ventricular dysfunction generally benefit positive pressure ventilation , data regard hemodynamic effect positive pressure ventilation leave ventricular dysfunction intrathoracic pressure deviate atmospheric , situation delay sternal closure . Shunted single ventricle physiology perhaps difficult predict effect different ventilator strategy sternal closure . The combination parallel pulmonary systemic circulation , less optimal total cardiac output , commonly , least pulmonary edema make difficult predict ideal ventilator strategy . Studies population focus effect FiO2 hyperventilation respiratory mechanic cardiopulmonary interaction . Nevertheless , work show occurrence pulmonary venous desaturation common follow stage 1 Norwood surgery , remain unknown risk benefit strategy lower high tidal volume low high PEEP hemodynamics oxygen delivery .</detailed_description>
