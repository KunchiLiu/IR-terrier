	<detailed_description>Sahlgrenska Univeristy Hospital tertiary university endoscopy center . At endoscopy unit physicians/endoscopists train EUS supervision experience endosonographist . Endosonographists examine patient referred routine , clinical EUS Sahlgrenska Univeristy hospital candidate study subject . Patients examine study endosonographists supervision lack . External , collaborate center invite participte study give study inclusion criterion ethical standard ensure . The investigator study developped score sheet assessment endosonographists training use standard clinical setting . The score sheet use endosonographist training ( performer ) self-assessment supervisor ( observer ) assessment performer . First , background data performer record ( pervious endoscopy experience etc ) . Then performer start examination guidance observer . The observer perform continuous evaluation assessment performer accord skill parameter ( N=5 ) Observer score sheet . Each parameter rank 1-5 scale ( 1=non-satisfactory performance , 5= excellent performance ) . Finally observer take , reevaluate finding performer finish examination . After examination performer fullfills Performer score sheet . Finally , performer observer record preliminary diagosis lesion examine . Adverse event complication record . A follow-up medical record patient perform 8 week EUS-examiantion respect final diagnosis lesion interest . The reference standard set best available combination surgery , pathology image report . The performerÂ´s assessment diagnosis categorize CORRECT FALSE . A correct diagnosis equal 3 Points false diagnosis equal 0 Points . Results term total mean score perfomers calculate collect study database . Feasibility study assessment sheet evaluate . Statistical analysis categorical data finally apply evaluate result respect progress learn curve study participant .</detailed_description>
