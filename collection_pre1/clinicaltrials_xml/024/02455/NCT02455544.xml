	<brief_title>The Clinical Utility Congo-Red Dot Test Diagnosis Early Prediction Preeclampsia During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder lead cause maternal perinatal morbidity death worldwide . When left untreated , preeclampsia lead seizure ( eclampsia ) , stroke , hemorrhage , kidney liver failure , death . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 99 % preeclampsia-related death occur low- mid-income country . Although case maternal death preventable , estimate ~63,000 woman die annually due preeclampsia alone . In developed country , U.S. UK , development implementation clinical guideline diagnosis management preeclampsia result dramatic decrease maternal morbidity mortality . Some measure include : ) blood pressure dipstick proteinuria screen prenatal visit ; b ) extensive laboratory work-up rule-out hemolysis , elevate liver enzyme , thrombocytopenia ( HELLP ) syndrome ; c ) hospital admission intensive clinical observation ; ) use magnesium sulfate anti-hypertensive medication prevent eclampsia intracranial hemorrhage e ) medically indicate early delivery strict clinical criterion severity give delivery definitive cure preeclampsia . It well-recognized number medically-indicated early delivery U.S. U.K. exceed necessary prevent maternal death morbidity relate preeclampsia . However , era widespread use antenatal corticosteroid advance neonatal intensive care , developed country , obstetrician lean towards indicate delivery three decade ago . At present U.S. , preeclampsia estimate trigger 70 % medically indicated preterm birth . Yet , implementation guideline feasible low- mid-income country . In scenario , tendency prolong pregnancy least 34 week likelihood survival premature neonate maximize . Recognizing conundrum , increase emphasis place find novel diagnostic prognostic biomarkers may help identification preeclamptic woman real need medically-indicated delivery oppose whose pregnancy could safely extend . That say , low- mid-income country , biomarkers potential significantly help current barrier reduce maternal morbidity death severe preeclampsia . Because compliance physician referral transport hospital significant issue rural area , early problem identify , good outcome . Accurate identification woman whose pregnancy high risk preeclampsia eclampsia would result timely referral medical facility appropriate treatment ( i.e magnesium sulfate medically-indicated delivery ) provide . Additionally , accurate diagnostic test preeclampsia implement develop country allow maternity unit run cost effectively avoid unnecessary referral , unnecessary admission 24h protein assessment . This also reduce number admission labor induction , number induction general indirectly number C-sections . Traditionally , diagnosis preeclampsia relies presence hypertension proteinuria . Unfortunately , sign often non-specific could confound many co-morbidities include essential hypertension chronic kidney disease . Spearheaded proteomics research , group identify woman severe form preeclampsia excrete urine high amount unfold misfolded protein . This phenomenon classify preeclampsia protein conformational disorder similar Alzheimer 's prion disease , yet particular pregnancy . It logically follow misfolded protein preeclampsia urine exhibit congophilia ( affinity azo-dye Congo Red ) . Congo Red develop textile industry 1800 ' , later find self-assembling property selectively stain misfolded amyloid brain patient Alzheimer 's . Based premise , simple urine diagnostic test [ Congo Red Dot ( CRD ) Test ] design , develop validate research laboratory .</detailed_description>
