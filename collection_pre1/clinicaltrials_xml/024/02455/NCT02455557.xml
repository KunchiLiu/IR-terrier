	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well vaccine therapy work give together temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . Vaccines make survivin peptide antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express survivin . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether temozolomide effective without vaccine therapy treat glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SurVaxM Vaccine Therapy Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) patient survivin positive newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) treat least 4 dos SVN53-67/M57-keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) peptide vaccine ( SurVaxM ) standard care temozolomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability SurVaxM patient receive standard care adjuvant temozolomide . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient survivin positive newly diagnose GBM treat SurVaxM adjuvant temozolomide . III . To describe immune response patient treat SurVaxM predictor response . IV . To evaluate objective tumor response rate ( applicable patient evaluable disease study entry , define per Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology [ RANO ] criterion ) predictor response . OUTLINE : Patients receive first prim dose SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine emulsion montanide ISA 51 subcutaneously ( SC ) sargramostim SC within 7-28 day completion chemoradiation . Treatment repeat every 2 week total 4 dos vaccine prim phase every 12 week adjuvant phase absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive standard adjuvant temozolomide orally ( PO ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course ( discretion investigator ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive maintenance SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine emulsion montanide ISA 51 SC sargramostim SC every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
