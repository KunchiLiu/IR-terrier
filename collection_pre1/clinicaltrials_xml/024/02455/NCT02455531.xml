	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare direct indirect measure right ventricular ( RV ) systolic diastolic function 11 year old subject randomly assign receive right ventricle pulmonary artery shunt ( RVPAS ) vs. modify Blalock-Taussig shunt ( MBTS ) time Norwood operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Outcomes Children With Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Impact Norwood Shunt Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Single Ventricle Reconstruction ( SVR ) trial first multicenter , randomize clinical trial compare two operation field congenital heart disease.8,11 Children HLHS relate single RV lesion enrol randomized receive either MBTS RVPAS time initial Norwood procedure . This landmark study provide extraordinary insight consequence shunt type , also course , treatment response short- mid-term outcome medically complex patient . Through SVR Trial SVR Extension Study ( SVR II ) , outcomes , include limited primary outcome transplant-free survival , evaluate patient cohort last enrolled patient reach 12 month 3 year age . While early post-operative transplant-free survival interstage period7 one year8 well child randomize RVPAS , survival 3-year evaluation appear equivalent two shunt type . Moreover , RVEF somewhat diminish number intervention higher RVPAS group.12 These finding raise concern RV dysfunction RVPAS group may progressive , lead significantly bad long-term outcome ; , benefit RVPAS short-term survival may outweigh longer-term morbidity mortality . Thus , optimal surgical approach newborn HLHS relate single RV lesion remain unclear . The Pediatric Heart Network ( PHN ) Investigators unique opportunity responsibility analyze effect type systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt place Norwood procedure longer-term survival , well define effect long-term outcome multi-institutional cohort exquisitely characterized subject single RV lesion . As subject enrol SVR cohort approach decade age , investigator aim : 1 ) determine shunt type time Norwood operation associate long-term difference cardiac function , survival , contributor quality life ; 2 ) characterize long-term outcome determine risk factor shunt type adverse long-term outcome child HLHS relate single ventricle anomaly .</detailed_description>
