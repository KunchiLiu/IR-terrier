	<brief_title>Tracking Neurodegeneration Early Wolfram Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Wolfram syndrome ( WFS ) rare ( 1 ~770,000 ) autosomal recessive genetic disease characterize early childhood onset insulin dependent diabetes , optic nerve atrophy , vision hearing loss , diabetes insipidus neurodegeneration , result death middle adulthood , typically due brainstem atrophy-induced respiratory failure 3 . There intervention slow stop devastate deterioration . However , much know mechanism underlie effect . The causative gene ( WFS1 ) identify investigator group 19984 , number loss-of-function mutation describe 4-6 . Cell 7 animal model 8 determine WFS1 encodes endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane-embedded protein call wolframin 9 , mutant form WSF1 protein lead disturbance ER calcium homeostasis , drive ER stress-mediated apoptosis 10-12 . This process kill insulin produce pancreatic β-cells , lead diabetes . WFS1 also express throughout brain , cell death via ER stress think underlie neurodegeneration WFS 6,13 , well implicated common neurodegenerative endocrine ( Type 1 Type 2 diabetes ) diseases 14 . Work animal model WFS progress rapidly towards identification viable intervention ER stress relate cell death12 . Some neurological feature disease may feasible target monitor clinical trial , due fact diabetes already present patient diagnose WFS . Unfortunately , limited information pattern brain change associate WFS . Although clinical retrospective data suggest neurological feature occur late ( 15-30 yr age ; Fig 10 ) disease process15,16 , direct measurement ( Preliminary Data ) suggest certain neurological abnormality present early time point assess , suggest altered neurodevelopment , whereas others follow neurodegenerative pattern . These distinction fundamentally new insight disease may shape treatment , biomarker selection investigator understanding impact ER stress develop brain . A good understanding neurodegenerative neurodevelopmental change early WFS necessary first step towards ready future clinical trial . Thus , primary goal proposal determine pattern brain alteration WFS time . Only understanding natural history brain functional structural change WFS investigator prepare evaluate benefit novel treatment . The investigator perform cross-sectional longitudinal assessment youth WFS , target sensitive neural system quantify neuroimaging relevant behavioral measure . In addition , investigator validate new WFS severity rating scale ( WFS Unified Rating Scale WURS ) , utility future multi-site treatment study . Preliminary data support feasibility approach potential generate important new information neurologic pattern WFS . A well understand trajectory ER stress-mediated brain change WFS may relevant common disease . Specific aim follow : 1 . To determine pattern neurologic impairment WFS association disease severity cross-sectional sample . The investigator hypothesize specific brain measure alter earlier associate closely overall disease severity others WFS . The investigator propose regional white matter microstructural integrity cerebellum , optic nerve area , brain stem volume , balance possibly anxiety distinguish individual early WFS control correlate severity standardize rating scale . To test hypothesis , investigator perform quantify neuroimaging , cognitive , motor , psychiatric , visual auditory evaluation individual WFS , preferentially recruit earlier disease process , ( n=30 ; age 5 older , within 10 year diabetes onset ) match healthy control ( n=30 ) control Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ; n=30 ) . 2 . To determine longitudinal pattern neurologic deterioration WFS . The investigator hypothesize measure specify Aim 1 show detectable change , sensitive measure show change early Wolfram patient compare control group . To test hypothesis , WFS , T1DM control participants re-assessed annually 3 year . Variables interest identify cross-sectional analysis target compare group correlate change disease severity measure investigator standardize rating scale . 3 . To explore brain structure-function relationship within WFS . To determine neuroimaging measure identify Aims 1 2 functional correlate , investigator explore difference ( cross-sectional data ) change ( longitudinal data ) neuroimaging variable correlate difference change select functional measure . Such data would help build hypothesis neural underpinnings functional change WFS . For example , investigator speculates integrity brainstem cerebellum related gait balance optic nerve area relate visual acuity .</detailed_description>
