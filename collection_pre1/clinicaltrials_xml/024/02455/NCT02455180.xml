	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Two Different High-dose Regimens Intravenous Vitamin C Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Critically ill patient trauma sepsis exhibit high degree vitamin C deficiency ICU admission vitamin C plasma concentration decrease even first three day admission . Vitamin C natural anti-oxidant crucial endothelial organ protection Objective : To determine pharmacokinetics two high dose regimen intravenous vitamin C critically ill patient , particular attain plasma concentration fraction retain body excreted urine . Study design : Prospective randomize control pharmacokinetic intervention study Study population : Adult critically ill patient admit ICU VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam , sepsis SIRS major surgery trauma non-neurological sequential organ failure ( SOFA ) score &gt; 6 expect length ICU stay &gt; 96 hour . Intervention ( applicable ) : Patients receive either 1 5 gram vitamin C intravenously twice daily two day .</detailed_description>
