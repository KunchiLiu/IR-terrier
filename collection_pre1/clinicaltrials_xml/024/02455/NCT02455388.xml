	<brief_title>d13C Added Sugar Intake Biomarker : Determining Validity Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption energy-containing add sugar ( AS ) particular , sugar-sweetened beverage ( SSB ) , suggest contributor weight gain . In child adolescent , total AS intake represent ~16 % total energy , ~300-400 kcal/d ; SSB comprise ~50 % total AS intake . Although recognize major health organization , role AS primary food source , SSB , development progression obesity relate co-morbidities remain controversial . A common research limitation area reliance self-reported measure dietary intake , present additional challenge study child . Thus , need objective method assess dietary intake , biomarkers AS consumption , recognize . The investigator establish validity fingerstick blood d13C AS biomarker adult , aim expand innovative biomarker study diet child . The investigator propose establish validity reliability fingerstick blood d13C AS biomarker child use two approach . First , control feeding component ( Study 1 ) provide data necessary validation biomarker actual AS intake , determine ability detect level AS intake . Second , cross-sectional component ( Study 2 ) compare biomarker self-reported intake data , collect method similar national nutritional surveillance methodology ( i.e. , NHANES ) . Study 1 include 30 adolescent age 12-18 yr , consume high AS ( 25 % total energy ) low AS ( 5 % total energy ) diet 7 day , random order . Study 2 include 325 child age 6-18 yr , complete five laboratory session . Record- assisted 24-hr dietary recall complete four session assess habitual AS intake , fingerstick blood sample obtain two session . The potential confounding effect non- sweetener corn animal product consumption address study quantify non- sweetener corn consumption control diet ( Study 1 ) self-reported dietary recall ( Study 2 ) , assess nitrogen stable isotope composition d15N fingerstick sample . To advance exist knowledge dietary assessment approach , urinary sugar urine d13C assess Study 1 , permit direct comparison biomarkers - exist ( urinary sucrose , fructose ) novel ( urine fingerstick d13C ) . The role AS health contentious decade , reliance self-reported intake data often-cited flaw area . Our finding could significantly advance research address health impact AS intake child adolescent .</detailed_description>
