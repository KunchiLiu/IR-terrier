	<brief_title>Adaptive Intervention Strategies Conduct Problems Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project propose conduct feasibility research inform implementation future full-scale SMART design ( i.e. , sequential , multiple assignment , randomize trial ) use construct adaptive intervention strategy ( AIS ) conduct problem prevention . AIS individualize treatment via decision rule specify type ( youth-focused parent focus ) intensity ( low dosage high dosage ) intervention formulate prior begin treatment base youth family characteristic and/or repeatedly adjust time base proximal outcome collect treatment . AIS need conduct problem prevention address heterogeneity at-risk youth variability response conventional fixed-type preventive intervention . With present SMART trial participant progress two stage intervention use stepped-care framework . In first stage participant randomize one two 'brief-type ' intervention option , either youth-focused Teen Intervene-Brief program ( TI-B ; Winters &amp; Leitten , 2007 ) parent-focused Everyday Parenting-Brief program ( EP-B ; Dishion et al. , 2003 , 2010 ) . Responders either program step monitored time maintenance . Non-responders either program step randomized one two second stage 'intensive-type ' intervention option feature either ( 1 ) continuation first stage option increase dosage ( EP-Expanded TI-Expanded ) , ( 2 ) switch alternative expand intervention modality . This feasibility study enroll high risk youth ( 10-17 year age ) arrest status misdemeanor offense refer pre-court juvenile diversion programming . The aims feasibility research ( 1 ) develop practice infrastructure implement SMART design ass practitioner adherence various intervention sequence , ( 2 ) roll stepped-care intervention sequence obtain estimate recruitment SMART , attrition stage , overall response rate first-stage intervention option , ( 3 ) describe demographic clinical characteristic sample diversion-referred youth enrol study , ( 4 ) create latent construct conduct problem use distal outcome , ( 5 ) explore utility incorporate secondary tailoring variable ( e.g. , child family risk characteristic ) adaptive intervention model .</detailed_description>
