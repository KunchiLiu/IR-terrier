	<brief_summary>Background Intraoperative hypotension common problem significantly contribute perioperative mortality morbidity . At moment `` gold standard '' perioperative fluid management call `` goal-directed therapy '' feature fluid resuscitation follow necessary catecholamine need perioperative cardiocirculatory support . Worldwide call `` physiological '' sodium chlorid ( 0.9 % NaCl ) solution often use infusate perioperative fluid management . Despite widespread use physiological saline major disadvantage increase incidence metabolic acidosis . Nevertheless catecholamine significant side effect well ( eg diminish renal perfusion , increase cardiovascular morbidity ) therefore use caution . In prior study group member patient undergoing renal transplantation receive either physiological saline acetate-buffered infusate show 50 % decrease catecholamine necessity acetate-buffered infusate group . The investigator therefore would like evaluate effect perioperative fluid choice necessity catecholamine use . Aim - Evaluation perioperative fluid choice necessity catecholamine cardiocirculatory support . - Description relationship perioperative fluid choice minimal blood pressure well time catecholamine use dosage . Methods The investigator plan prospective randomized-controlled trial patient undergo major abdominal surgery Vienna General Hospital Medical University Vienna . Fluid management catecholamine use base oesophageal Doppler -based treatment scheme .</brief_summary>
