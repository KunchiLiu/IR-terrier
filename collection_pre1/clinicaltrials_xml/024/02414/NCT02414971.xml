	<brief_summary>Project Study : Pilot Human Study Specific Aims : 1. describe level mitochondrial respiratory enzyme 2. examine relationship level mitochondrial enzyme , fatigue , health-related quality life ; 3. compare level mitochondrial enzyme men clinically-significant change fatigue change fatigue . Significance Study : Cancer relate fatigue common side effect cancer . Cancer relate fatigue poorly understood . Many different biological mechanism theorize , include mitochondrial dysfunction . Self-reported description reduce energy muscle weakness lend support possible relationship cancer relate fatigue mitochondrial dysfunction . Main Research Variables : Mitochondrial Enzymes , Cancer relate fatigue , health relate quality life Design : Descriptive , longitudinal study Sample/Setting : Men non-metastatic prostate-cancer schedule receive radiation therapy Methods : Questionnaires , mouth swab blood collect four study visit : prior treatment , midpoint treatment , completion treatment within 90 day finish treatment . Four mouth swab collect per participant study visit . Implications Practice : Understanding role mitochondrial enzyme cancer relate fatigue major clinical implication development target intervention provide specific knowledge patient family make informed treatment decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Narrative Purpose Specific Aims The primary purpose pilot study explore relationship mitochondrion fatigue men diagnose prostate cancer . The specific aim : ( ) describe level mitochondrial enzyme , ( b ) examine relationship level mitochondrial enzyme , fatigue , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) ; ( c ) compare level mitochondrial enzyme men without fatigue . Methods Design The propose study use descriptive , longitudinal design describe level mitochondrial enzymes Sample Setting Men prostate cancer schedule receive radiation University Florida Health Cancer Center eligible study participation . Men enrol : ( ) prostate cancer ( b ) schedule receive radiation ( c ) least 18 year age . Patients exclude : ( ) inflammatory infectious condition rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , cirrhosis ; infectious disease HIV , tuberculosis , hepatitis ; ( b ) type cancer ; ( c ) major psychiatric disorder alcohol drug abuse within past 5 year ; ( ) receive schedule receive chemotherapy ; ( e ) take steroid , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory , tranquilizer . Experimental Variables : The primary purpose study describe level mitochondrial enzyme , Cancer relate fatigue health relate quality life . All mouth swab sample collect cod store secured freezer . The frozen buccal swab sample batch ship National Institute Nursing Research process shipped St. Christopher 's Hospital Children Philadelphia analyse . Data Collection Schedule Study time point . Data collect four study visit : baseline , midpoint treatment , completion treatment within 90 day treatment . Four buccal swab collect per participant study visit use Epicentre Catch-All Sample Collection Swabs-Soft Pack . Study Procedures . The patient include study consent enrolled Institutional Review Board-approved protocol men prostate cancer schedule receive radiation treatment . Biologic ( buccal swab ) questionnaire ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ) data collect four study visit . Each study visit arrange coincide schedule clinic visit decrease patient burden .</detailed_description>
