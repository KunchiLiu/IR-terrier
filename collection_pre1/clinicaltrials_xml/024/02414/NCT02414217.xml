	<brief_summary>The objective project test two intervention design improve diabetes-related numeracy . Numeracy ability understand use number . People diabetes use number variety way manage condition ( e.g. , understanding blood sugar value , count carbohydrate , take medication right dose time ) . As part project , investigator develop pilot test two intervention improve diabetes-related numeracy : ( 1 ) series in-person education class ( 2 ) one-time , online diabetes education class . The investigator look see whether participant education class show improvement diabetes-related numeracy skill , self-care behavior attitude , clinical outcome ( i.e. , body mass index , blood pressure , blood sugar [ A1c ] ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up 220 American Indians Alaska Natives diabetes enrol . Each participant randomly assign 1 3 study arm : ( 1 ) in-person education group , ( 2 ) online education group , ( 3 ) control group . The in-person intervention group attend four class session address numeracy skill use management diabetes ( e.g. , count carbohydrate ) . The online education group complete single online module provide train diabetes-related numeracy skill . The control group receive write diabetes educational material . The investigator collect data baseline , immediately intervention participation ( in-person online class ) , one final time three month conclusion intervention . The investigator conduct analysis determine intervention participant experience positive change diabetes numeracy ( primary outcome ) well several secondary outcome measure follow intervention . Secondary outcome include : diabetes knowledge , self-efficacy , outcome expectancy , readiness change , self-care behavior , clinical outcome ( i.e. , body mass index , blood pressure , blood sugar [ A1c ] ) . The investigator also assess whether change numeracy predict change secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
