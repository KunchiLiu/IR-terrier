	<brief_title>Ovarian Stimulation Single Injection Elonva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elonva ( corifollitrophin alfa ) show effective rFSH stimulant Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation ( COH ) set IVF treatment . Its long duration action ( 7 day ) result significant reduction number COH stimulation injection ( average 3 injection v 9 injection traditional `` short acting '' r FSH COH ) , 30 % patient require single Elonva injection COH ( Engage study , Devroey et al 2009 ) . It assume reduction number require COH injection advantage improved patient acceptability well compliance due reduction room error . Despite advantage clinical uptake Elonva slow due 2 principal concern among clinician : 1 . A tendency Elonva COH result high ovarian response increase risk Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) . While risk OHSS statistically significant pivotal Engage study , still numerically great chance OHSS great chance IVF cycle cancel due OHSS risk Elonva arm compare traditional Puregon arm . Since woman high risk OHSS exclude Engage study , clinician perceive risk OHSS likely significantly great heterogeneous general clinical population . Whether correct assumption still debate , perceive issue exist Elonva protocol must address Elonva become use widely COH stimulant . 2 . According Engage Ensure study , majority ( 70 % ) woman use Elonva require `` top '' short act Puregon rFSH , average 2 dos require patient reach criterion trigger oocyte retrieval . As result clinic require teach two different injection protocol , increase time require educate patient possibly increase risk confusion . The ability deliver solitary COH stimulant without need `` top '' Puregon would major advantage . Rationale We would like propose may possible use solitary dose Elonva sole COS rFSH stimulant vast majority woman undergo IVF , assume possible `` coasting '' ( withhold short act rFSH ) day 8 stimulation trigger/ oocyte retrieval still result significant number mature oocytes produce . In set OHSS common practice withhold rFSH stimulant towards end COS process . It generally accept medium size follicle 14 mm great continue develop maturity absence rFSH stimulation , small follicle regress . This therapeutic advantage reduce estradiol level OHSS risk woman high risk OHSS . With coast physiology mind , propose provide single injection Elonva result significant number follicle 14 mm great day 8 stimulation , rFSH require . Results Engage study ( Doody et al 2011 ) reveal day 8 stimulation average 5.1 follicles 15 mm great . Therefore even `` top '' rFSH give day 8 , one could expect get least 5 mature oocytes oocyte retrieval trigger hCG next 2 day . While 5 mature oocytes significantly less produced traditional Elonva protocol use additional rFSH ( average 10.8 Engage study , 10.7 Ensure study ) , could perceive significant advantage since likely result significant reduction OHSS risk , perceive problem traditional Elonva protocol . If assume 70 % fertilization rate approximately half embryos good quality day 4/5 culture , production &gt; 3 mature oocytes ensure generation least one good quality embryo transfer good chance pregnancy . This type low impact stimulation likely popular Europe Australia clinician already accept benefit mild COS . In summary , able provide evidence pilot study single injection Elonva result majority woman reach oocyte retrieval production least 3 mature oocyte , give good fresh embryo transfer pregnancy rate OHSS , coast Elonva protocol may become significant clinical protocol low impact COS future .</detailed_description>

No major sperm quality issue ( ejaculate sperm concentration &gt; 5 million/ ml , motility &gt; 25 % neat sample ) . ICSI indication poor morphology would acceptable trial enrollment . Maternal age 1837 year inclusive . Low ovarian reserve ( antral follicle count 210 mm &lt; 7 , early follicular phase FSH &gt; 10 IU/L , &lt; 4 oocyte prior IVF cycle dose rFSH &gt; 150 IU ) . Ovarian pathology ( PCOS , ovarian cyst , endometrioma , poor transvaginal ultrasound ovary access ) . 2 previous cycle IVF ( stimulated cycle ) live birth pregnancy result , one prior stimulate cycle IVF 2 frozen embryo transfer cycle without live birth outcome ( possible implantation failure ) . Significant pelvic pathology likely impair embryo implantation ( fibroid , polyp , uterine septum , hydrosalpinx ) . Intention freeze embryo nil fresh transfer ( preimplantation genetic screening , oncology fertility preservation ) . Known renal impairment Use long regulation `` flare '' IVF protocol .</criteria>
