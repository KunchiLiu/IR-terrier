	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , open-label phase 2/3 study Toca 511 Toca FC versus standard care comprise Investigator 's choice single agent chemotherapy ( lomustine temozolomide ) bevacizumab administer subject undergo resection first second recurrence ( include recurrence ) GBM AA . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion randomize prior surgery 1:1 ratio receive either Toca 511 Toca FC ( Experimental arm , Arm T ) control treatment one option standard care ( Arm SOC ) . Due prognostic influence molecular subgroup isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation , trial stratify base determination primary pathology subsequent biopsy know locally otherwise determine centrally . A second stratification factor base patient 's Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ( 70-80 v 90-100 ) . Further , account potential difference treatment choice control arm region , trial stratify geographical region randomization process . The study conduct 2 part ; enrollment phase 3 begin phase 2 result available .</brief_summary>
