	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase I study test safety different dos specially prepared immune cell ( call `` T cell '' ) collect blood . The Investigators want find safe dose modify T cell patient malignant pleural disease . They want find effect T cell patient cancer ( MPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malignant Pleural Disease Treated With Autologous T Cells Genetically Engineered Target Cancer-Cell Surface Antigen Mesothelin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose-escalating , non randomize , single-center , phase I study mesothelin-targeted T cell administer intrapleurally single infusion patient diagnosis ( histologically cytologically document ) MPD mesothelioma , lung cancer , breast cancer . The total number patient studied depend number dose level test , maximum dose 3×10^6 mesothelin-targeted T cells/kg maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients MPD age ≥18 year Karnofsky performance status ≥70 % Patients malignant pleural disease ( MPD ) , pathologically confirm MSKCC ( radiographic confirmation acceptable screen phase eligibility ) , define one following ( patient yet receive treatment may enroll screen portion ) : 1 . Malignant pleural mesothelioma previously treat least one prior treatment regimen . 2 . Nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic pleura—previously treat least one prior treatment regimen ( chemotherapy target agent ) document progression disease . Patients disease outside pleura discuss among study PI CoPIs prior consider eligible study . Disease outside pleura must require immediate therapy per PI 's discretion . 3 . Breast cancer metastatic pleura— previously treat least one prior treatment regimen ( chemotherapy target agent ) document progression disease . Patients disease outside pleura discuss among study PI CoPIs prior consider eligible study . Disease outside pleura must require immediate therapy per PI 's discretion . Expression mesothelin must confirm meet one follow criterion . 1 . Mesothelin expression ( &gt; 10 % tumor express mesothelin ) immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis 2 . Elevated serum SMRP level ( &gt; 0.4 nM/L ) . Free flow pleural effusion require management placement pleural catheter . Patients functional pleural catheter already place eligible study , long clinical concern infection . OR No freeflowing pleural effusion : Interventional Radiologist agree radiologyguided intrapleural injection CAR T cell feasible . Chemotherapy , target therapy ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) radiotherapy must complete least 14 day prior administration T cell . Continuation hormonal therapy ( ie breast cancer ) acceptable . Prior immunotherapy checkpoint blockade ( i.e . PD1 inhibitor , PDL1 inhibitor CTL4antagonist similar agent ) must complete 1 month1prior T cell infusion . Chemotherapy must complete least 7 day prior leukapheresis Any major thoracic ( thoracotomy lung esophageal resection ) abdominal ( laparotomy organ resection ) operation must occur least 28 day study enrollment . Patients undergone diagnostic VATS laparoscopy include study . All acute toxic effect previous radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgical procedure must resolve grade I low accord CTCAE ( version 4.0 ) . Lab requirement ( hematology ) White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥3000 cells/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 neutrophils/mm3 Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm3 Lab requirement ( serum chemistry ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum alanine aminotransferase serum aspartate aminotransferase ( ALT/AST ) ≤.5x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN Cr &gt; 1.5x ULN , calculate clearance &gt; 60 Negative screen human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) antigen , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . If test perform previous 3 month , need repeat testing , long documentation result provide study site . Subjects must receive counsel sign separate inform consent form HIV testing . Subjects partner reproductive potential must agree use effective form contraception period drug administration 4 week completion last administration study drug . An effective form contraception define oral contraceptive plus 1 form barrier doublebarrier method contraception ( condom spermicide condom diaphragm ) . Subjects must able understand potential risk benefit study must able read provide write , inform consent study Any prior history brain metastases Nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic pleura extends outside pleura require immediate therapy Breast cancer metastatic pleura extends outside pleura require immediate therapy Prior history seizure disorder Patients currently receive treatment concurrent active malignancy Continuation hormonal therapy ( i.e . breast cancer ) acceptable . Prior immunotherapy checkpoint blockade ( i.e . PD1 inhibitor , PDL1 inhibitor CTL4antagonist similar agent ) must complete 1 month prior T cell infusion . Autoimmune antibodymediated disease , include limited systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , temporal arteritis ( Patients history hypothyroidism exclude ) Clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association class III/IV ) severe debilitate pulmonary disease Pregnant lactate woman An infection require antibiotic treatment within 7 day start treatment ( day 0 ) A requirement daily systemic corticosteroid reason requirement immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent . Topical , nasal , inhaled steroid permit . Administration live , attenuated vaccine within 8 week start treatment ( day 0 ) throughout study Any medical condition , opinion PI , may interfere subject 's participation compliance study</criteria>
