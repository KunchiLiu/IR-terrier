	<brief_title>Hypoxia Analysis Head and/or Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence head neck squamous cell cancer ( HNSCC ) around 600 000 case per year worldwide . The main site HNSCC larynx , pharynx oral cavity . Head neck cancer , however , also include salivary gland tumour , well nasopharyngeal cancer paranasal nasal sinus cancer rare . The major risk factor smoke , alcohol abuse Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection . In spite radical surgical treatment aggressive neo-adjuvant adjuvant therapy , prognosis head neck cancer poor due fact tumour often hypoxic . Tumour hypoxia heterogenous result imbalance oxygen supply oxygen consumption . Acute hypoxia cause abnormal structure function microvasculature supply tumour . Chronic hypoxia cause increased distance oxygen diffuse get blood vessel tumour cell reduce oxygen cause anaemia treatment disease-related . These hypoxic region show affect metabolism cell , make aggressive increase risk metastasis bad prognosis . Also , radiotherapy relies oxygen cause maximal cytotoxicity , lack oxygen cell even lack oxygen consumption cell would cause decrease effectiveness radiotherapy cytotoxicity . Hypoxic cell acidic environment affect drug delivery drug activity , chemotherapy compromise . In order predict outcome identify patient bad prognosis patient would benefit appropriate treatment , vivo measurement tumour hypoxia require . Numerous method explore accepted gold standard . Imaging biomarker analysis show potential data insufficient . In project investigator would prospectively use exist image technique analysis various bodily fluid predict outcome . This collaboration 5 different department much information possible analyse use come possible solution .</detailed_description>
