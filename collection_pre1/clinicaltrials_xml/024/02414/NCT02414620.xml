	<brief_summary>The purpose research test efficacy Dental Vibe Injection Comfort System . The study conduct faculty student subject see difference comfort level ASA injection give one side topical anesthesia lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine use standard syringe , side uing Dental Vibe , topical anesthesia lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine standard syringe . The Dental Vibe emit strong pulsed vibration transmit via silicone mouth piece mucosal tissue . This turn interfere , block reduces perception pain injection patient . It state phenomenon achieve due `` gate theory '' neuronal activity . There also likely , distraction placebo effect contribute device ' efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Dental Vibe Unit Use Reduction Elimination Pain During Dental Anesthetic Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects group 3-4 2 ½ hour 1 subject operator deliver injection , 1 subject assistant , 1 subject patient receive injection . It conduct pre-clinical local anesthesia rotation clinical setting . OSHA regulation follow supply provide subject . Using standard syringe , operator assemble 27 gauge short needle load 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 epi cartridge . Gauze apply area upper right muccobuccal fold , penetration site ASA injection administer . Small amount topical place penetration site leave approximately one minute . The subject posing operator obtain retraction method use mouth mirror . The ASA injection technique apply 1/3 cartridge solution administer deposition site . Immediately , use standard syringe remain anesthestic cartridge , operator replace 27 gauge short needle . Gauze apply area upper leave muccobuccal fold , penetration site ASA injection administer . Small amount topical place penetration site leave approximately one minute . The subject posing operator obtain retraction method use Dental Vibe Unit , turn device keep active 3-5 second prior , , needle penetration . The ASA injection technique apply 1/3 cartridge solution administer deposition site . The ASA injection technique penetration site muccobuccal fold maxillary canine maxillary first pre-molar . The depth penetration initially 3 mm soft tissue , needle slowly advance additional 2 mm bone gently reach . Anesthesia deposit rate ¼ cartridge / 15 second . An aspiration test give , confirm anesthesia deposit blood vessel . Once 1/3 cartridge dispense , needle remove site . An evaluation give subject pose patient . The subject carefully observe appropriate site preparation , injection technique , proper placement mouth mirror , proper placement Dental Vibe Unit .</detailed_description>
