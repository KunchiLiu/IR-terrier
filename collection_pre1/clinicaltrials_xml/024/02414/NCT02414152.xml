	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine anakinra ( interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ) improve hear threshold patient sudden sensorineural hearing loss respond oral steroid therapy . The patient enrol recently complete course oral steroid demonstrate change audiometric threshold follow corticosteroid therapy . The investigator measure hearing threshold ( Pure tone average word recognition score ) anakinra correlate finding circulate IL-1 level patient 's blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effects Anakinra Corticosteroid-resistant Subjects With Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient experience acute , sensorineural decline hearing , timely corticosteroid administration may result preservation hearing . For patient sudden sensorineural hearing loss fail respond corticosteroid therapy , study offer determine anakinra safe effective alternative therapy clinical hearing restoration . The investigator previously demonstrate IL-1beta inhibition ( anakinra ) small cohort patient steroid resistant autoimmune inner ear disease effective demonstrate audiological improvement .</detailed_description>
