	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ribociclib gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient solid tumor lymphoma spread place body usually cure controlled treatment . Ribociclib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ribociclib together gemcitabine hydrochloride may work well treat patient solid tumor lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe dose-limiting toxicity identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose combination LEE011 ( ribociclib ) gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient advance solid tumor lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe safety tolerability combination LEE011 gemcitabine . II . To describe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) LEE011 combination gemcitabine . III . To describe preliminary evidence efficacy combination LEE011 gemcitabine . IV . To evaluate correlation cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) amplification ( test fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) , retinoblastoma ( RB ) P16 expression ( immunohistochemistry ) archive biopsied tumor tissue treatment response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive ribociclib orally ( PO ) day 1-14 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
