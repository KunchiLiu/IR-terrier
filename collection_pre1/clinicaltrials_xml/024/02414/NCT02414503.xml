	<brief_summary>Oxytocin ( OT ) small , naturally occur peptide currently clinical use stimulate lactation breastfeed woman . The intranasal administration OT recently attract attention potential novel treatment several psychiatric disorder autism . However , give anatomy nasal cavity , current design nasal spray would expect provide inadequate delivery medication area nasal cavity direct transport brain via olfactory nerve could potentially occur . OptiNose develop intranasal delivery device provide improved reproducibility nasal delivery , improve deposition upper posterior region nasal cavity olfactory nerve innervate nasal cavity . The primary objective study identify difference single dose 8 international unit ( IU ) oxytocin , 24 IU oxytocin , placebo deliver intranasally optimise OptiNose device volunteer Autism Spectrum Disorder . This measured term performance cognitive test physiological marker .</brief_summary>
