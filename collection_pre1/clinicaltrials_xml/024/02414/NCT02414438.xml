	<brief_title>Establishing Clinical Utility First StepDx PLUS NextStepDx PLUS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study interventional longitudinal study design physician practice . 225 specialist general pediatrician without previous exposure FirstStepDx PLUS NextStepDx PLUS select nationally representative list approximately 25,000 board-certified pediatrician 5,000 specialist . These physician randomize one three arm : receive information regard FirstStepDx PLUS ( `` Intervention A '' ) , receive information FirstStepDx PLUS NextStepDx PLUS ( `` Intervention B '' ) use clinical practice , control receive intervention . Specifically test hypothesis : 1 . Clinical practice , specifically decision around treatment individual disorder postnatal development include DD , ASD , ID vary widely among physician type . This documentation variation practice demonstrate need new diagnostic service FirstStepDx PLUS NextStepDx PLUS would fulfill 2 . FirstStepDx PLUS NextStepDx PLUS improve quality appropriateness care therapeutic plan , measure number physician correctly act result assay A Physician Questionnaire administer physician . This questionnaire ass physician , patient practice characteristic . Data gather set question become part baseline ( pre-intervention ) assessment use analysis . At baseline assessment , Clinical Performance Value ( CPVs ) Vignettes , validate tool measure physician performance behavior use . CPV vignette use establish clinical utility molecular diagnostic space . The CPV vignette use study simulate clinical encounter patient atypical clinical presentation indicative possible genetic developmental disorder . Each physician provide open-ended response regard clinical care . These response score five domain ( take medical history , perform physical examination , order appropriate test , make diagnosis prescribe treatment explicit evidence criterion determine literature expert physician . Results present percentage correct control primacy effect use case within pair randomization . Each case take approximately 15-20 minute complete . All case response complete electronically online confidential . No physician practice name use report result study . The CPVs randomly assign physician complete 3 CPVs™ ( one type ) . Each CPVs score physician change clinical practice include treatment change , frequency follow , laboratory test image study order - see scoring sheet . The objective study ass FirstStepDx PLUS ( NextStepDx PLUS ) test affect variability clinical practice resultant impact . Primary Endpoint Differences CPV diagnosis/treatment domain score post-intervention versus baseline intervention control group physician ) . Secondary Endpoints - Difference utilization appropriate treatment include indicated versus unnecessary therapy pre- post-intervention intervention control group - Difference utilization laboratory test fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) analyse , global assessment , utilization laboratory test pre- post-intervention , intervention control group - Difference overall Clinical Performance Value Vignettes ( CPV® ) score post-intervention versus baseline intervention control group</detailed_description>
