	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new radioactive compound use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan identify tau tangle ( certain protein might associate Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 's Disease ) brain , amount tau tangle brain relationship cognitive status . This study involve PET scan use radioactive compound , F 18 T807 measurement tau deposition . This radioactive compound approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . An MRI may also conduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F 18 T807 Tau PET Imaging Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 's Network ( DIAN Project )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize vivo tau image ultimately : - Demonstrate presence tau fibril brain pre-symptomatic stage cognitive decline , prior cerebral atrophy , hypometabolism ( measure 18F-FDG PET image ) , dementia . - Demonstrate phenoconversion cognitively normal ( CN ) status early stage cognitive impairment closely correlated neocortical F 18 T807 uptake amyloid positive CN individual positive F 18 T807 demonstrate conversion early dementia . - Correlate closely appearance CSF marker tau , include tau , p-tau , VILIP-1 . - Co-localize specific cognitive deficit ( i.e . patient tau deposition leave lateral temporal lobe primarily language deficit ) . - Predict onset dementia accurately exist biomarkers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants meet eligibility criterion enrollment `` Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 's Network ( DIAN ) Performance Site '' ( IRB ID : 201109187 ) 2 . Male female participant , least 18 year age 3 . Cognitively normal , mild dementia , assess clinically 4 . Participant able willing undergo testing ( MRI CT , PET , radioactive tracer injection ; unable undergo MRI , CT use generate regionsofinterest ) . 5 . Premenopausal woman undergo urine pregnancy test within 24 hour drug administration . 1 . Has condition , Investigator 's opinion , could increase risk participant , limit participant 's ability tolerate experimental procedure , interfere collection/analysis data ( example , participant severe chronic back pain might able lie still scan procedure ) . 2 . Is deem likely unable perform imaging procedure reason . 3 . Has high risk Torsades de Pointes take medication know prolong QT interval . 4 . Has hypersensitivity F 18 T807 excipients . 5 . Contraindications PET , PETCT MR ( e.g . electronic medical device , inability lie still long period ) make unsafe individual participate . 6 . Severe claustrophobia . 7 . Currently pregnant breastfeeding .</criteria>
