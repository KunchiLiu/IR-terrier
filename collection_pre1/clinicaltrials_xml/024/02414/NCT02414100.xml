	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study patient derive cancer cell line identify molecular change patient previously untreated pancreatic cancer receive gemcitabine hydrochloride-based chemotherapy . Cell line refer sample take patient 's tumor grow many month year laboratory , therefore study scientifically . Studying cell line laboratory may help doctor understand genetic change occur tumor chemotherapy allow tumor resist grow despite treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Derived Cancer Cell Lines Identifying Molecular Changes Patients With Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer Receiving Gemcitabine Hydrochloride-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare genetic profile tumor progression occur , tumor prior treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Additional molecular pattern , beyond genetics , analyze , include ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) protein expression . OUTLINE : Tissue blood sample collect genetic analysis via sequence patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously gemcitabine hydrochloride paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation . Chemotherapy part protocol . Per standard care , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride ( IV ) first 3 4 week ( qw 3/4 wk ) gemcitabine hydrochloride paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV qw 3/4 wk absence disease progression recurrence .</detailed_description>
