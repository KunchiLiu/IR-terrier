	<brief_summary>Children hospitalize severe illness sub-Saharan Africa high risk morbidity mortality follow discharge hospital . These child represent accessible high-risk population target intervention prevent morbidity mortality could dramatic impact . A large cluster randomize trial azithromycin deliver mass drug administration program within trachoma endemic area sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate almost 50 % mortality benefit child 1-9 year age treat community . However , mass drug administration azithromycin lead rapid emergence macrolide resistance within treated community expensive . The targeted delivery azithromycin child hospital discharge may novel practical intervention maximize benefit minimize risk antibiotic resistance . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine efficacy azithromycin provide discharge , compare placebo , reduce mortality re-hospitalization rate child age 1-59 month Kenya . The study also investigate potential mechanism azithromycin may reduce morbidity mortality population ass emergence antibiotic resistance among treated individual primary caregiver . A cost-effectiveness analysis intervention also conduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azithromycin Prevent Post-discharge Morbidity Mortality Kenyan Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 3.5 million death occur annually child less 5 year age sub-Saharan Africa , approximately 70 % due infectious cause . One-year mortality rate high 15 % document following hospital discharge sub-Saharan Africa , rate 8-fold high non-hospitalized child . Children discharge hospital Africa may represent accessible high-risk population target intervention reduce mortality . A recent trial mass drug administration azithromycin reduce childhood mortality half among child Ethiopia community receive intervention . However , concern potential emergence antimicrobial resistance , possible toxicity , feasibility delivery barrier community-wide distribution antibiotic . Targeted chemotherapeutic intervention , include use cotrimoxazole among HIV-infected child use amoxicillin cefdinir among malnourished child , show reduce mortality specific vulnerable population . Children recently hospitalize high-risk population similar target approach azithromycin distribution may optimize benefit reduce individual population level risk . The mechanisms azithromycin may impact morbidity mortality well describe . Among high-risk pediatric population history recent illness , azithromycin may act treat residual disease eliminate inpatient therapy , provide prophylaxis future infectious exposure time immune suppression vulnerability follow illness , treat underlie enteric dysfunction associate mucosal immune/gut barrier disruption inflammation , and/or clear asymptomatic carriage potentially pathogenic organism . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 5-day course azithromycin child age 1 59 month discharge hospital Western Kenya reduce post-discharge re-hospitalizations mortality , explore possible mechanism azithromycin benefit risk , identify correlate intermediate marker re-hospitalization death post discharge period . Primary Aims Aim 1 . To compare rate re-hospitalization mortality 6 month follow hospital discharge among Kenyan child receive 5-day azithromycin vs. placebo . Hypothesis : The provision 5-day course azithromycin provide discharge reduce hospital readmission death within 6 month follow discharge , compare placebo . Aim 2a . To evaluate possible mechanism ( ) azithromycin may affect morbidity mortality , compare reason re-hospitalization , prevalence pathogen carriage , marker enteric dysfunction randomization arm . Hypothesis : Children treat azithromycin experience few hospitalization due diarrhea , acute respiratory infection , malnutrition , less likely respiratory gastrointestinal carriage potentially pathogenic organism , less evidence enteric dysfunction , compare child treat placebo 6 month follow hospital discharge . Aim 2b . To determine whether empiric administration azithromycin hospital discharge increase risk antimicrobial resistance commensal Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) Streptococcus pneumoniae ( S. pneumoniae ) isolate treated child household contact . Hypothesis : Isolates commensal E. coli S. pneumoniae child treat azithromycin household contact high level macrolide Î²-lactam resistance , compare placebo group , 90 day follow-up , resistance 2 arm similar 6 month . Aim 3 . To identify correlate intermediate marker post-discharge mortality hospital readmission among hospitalized Kenyan child . Hypothesis : Children young age , enteric dysfunction , high level bacterial pathogen carriage , immune dysfunction , malnutrition experience frequent re-hospitalizations death . Aim 4 . To determine cost-effectiveness post-discharge administration 5-day course azithromycin setting vary antibiotic use , re-hospitalization rate , mortality rate . Hypothesis : The provision 5-day course azithromycin provide discharge cost-effective setting moderate high re-hospitalization mortality rate .</detailed_description>
