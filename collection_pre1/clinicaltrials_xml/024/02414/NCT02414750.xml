	<brief_title>Vemurafenib Plus Cobimetinib Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Molecular target therapy BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib currently use first line treatment patient unresectable stage IIIc metastatic melanoma harbor BRAFV600 mutation , present 50 % melanoma patient . Despite improvement Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) en Overall Survival ( OS ) compare dacabarzine , acquire resistance develops virtually patient treat vemurafenib great concern . Combining BRAF inhibitor MEK inhibitor target MAPK pathway downstream , however , may overcome acquire resistance BRAF inhibition recent study MEK inhibitor BRAF inhibitor combine monotherapy seem promise . In phase IB trial preliminary efficacy vemurafenib cobimetinib ( GDC-0973 ) , highly selective inhibitor MEK1 seem encouraging initial response rate 85 % currently phase III study vemurafenib versus vemurafenib plus cobimetinib BRAFV600 mutation positive patient advanced stage melanoma underway . It expect near future combine BRAF MEK inhibition standard care patient BRAFV600 mutate metastatic melanoma . Diagnostic CT ass reduction tumor size within day initiation therapy anatomic size provide information development therapy response resistance molecular level . It clearly demonstrate alteration metabolism occur early anatomical size reduction initiation therapy . Molecular image PET visualize metabolic activity tumor sensitive method detect alteration cell metabolism , even shortly start therapy . 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) use visualize glucose metabolism , whereas 18F-Fluoro-3'-deoxy-3 ' L-fluorothymidine ( 18F-FLT ) use visualize proliferation . In preclinical mouse model 18F-FLT appear predict response resistance therapy well 18F-FDG . However , far 18F-FDG PET use monitor response vemurafenib BRAFV600 mutate metastatic melanoma patient , show rapid decline 18F-FDG within 2 week follow treatment . Preclinical study observation melanoma highly proliferative malignancy patient suggest 18F-FLT might radiopharmaceutical first choice set . By detect metabolic alteration , responder might distinguish non-responders earlier phase compare anatomical imaging CT . This way , unnecessary expensive treatment combine BRAF/MEK-inhibitor therapy side effect prevent patient benefit therapy . Furthermore , level decline metabolic activity first two week initiation therapy might predict progression free survival ( PFS ) preliminary result literature suggest . This single arm explorative phase II clinical trial 90 subject advanced stage melanoma harbour BRAFV600 mutation . PET image molecular diagnostics combine order monitor response treatment vemurafenib plus cobimetinib , examine development resistance correlate change metabolic/proliferative activity extend target inhibition .</detailed_description>
