	<brief_summary>This phase I II clinical study patient malignant pleural mesothelioma ( type cancer affect line lung ) . Patients receive infusion ( give vein ) autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) . TILs type white blood cell recognize tumor cell enter cause tumor cell break . Prior cell infusion , patient receive two drug cyclophosphamide fludarabine prepare body receive TILs . After cell infusion , patient receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy . This study see safe useful regimen treat malignant pleural mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
