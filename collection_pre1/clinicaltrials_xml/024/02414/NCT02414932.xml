	<brief_summary>Depression affect 20 % people lifetime severe debilitate illness . Indeed , World Health Organisation estimate depression soon second lead contributor burden disease worldwide . One big problem patient doctor currently available antidepressant drug psychotherapy work 30 % people . However , 60 % treatment-resistant patient recover fully electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Even though develop 75 year ago , ECT continue powerful treatment severe , often life-threatening , depression . Despite , recently report severe depression symptom return ( call `` relapse '' ) nearly 40 % responder within six month complete course ECT . Actually , high relapse rate see patient treatment-resistant depression , irrespective treatment receive . There thus urgent need good treatment prevent relapse one possibility old drug call ketamine . Ketamine block activity glutamate , one major chemical messenger system brain . Because effect sometimes use anaesthetic also make feel bit `` high '' sometimes abused recreational drug . Fortunately , small dos quite safe . Recently , find ketamine remarkably rapid , brief , antidepressant effect , include reduce suicidal thought . We wish evaluate ketamine way reduce relapse rate people treat successfully ECT severe depression . Developing new treatment , understand work , would tremendous benefit person severe depression , family , wide society .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine Depression Relapse Prevention Following ECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN : This pilot trial two phase . Phase 1 prospective open study involve recruit cohort patient major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV criterion ) refer ECT . Patients subsequently identify responder invite participate Phase 2 , two-group parallel-design randomise control pilot trial . Consented ECT-responders randomly allocate 1:1 ratio four-week course either once-weekly ketamine midazolam infusion , continue regular care . Participants followed-up six-months follow ECT identify relapse occurs . RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING : In Phase 2 , ECT responder randomise baseline data collection . Patients raters blind treatment allocation . The anaesthetist administer ketamine/midazolam infusion blind involved assessment data analysis . Computerised random allocation , use randomly permute block , do independently . PARTICIPANTS : Inclusion criterion : Patients ≥18 year unipolar major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV ) , 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD-24 ) score ≥21 , refer ECT invite participate open Phase 1 . Patients physical examination , routine haematology biochemistry investigation , ECG screen medical condition might affect ability treat ECT ketamine . For randomised Phase 2 , patient must ( ) receive substantial course ECT Phase 1 ( i.e . least five session ) , ( ii ) achieve least response criterion ( i.e . ≥60 % decrease baseline HRSD-24 score score ≤16 two consecutive weekly rating ) , ( iii ) nominate adult stay 24-hours out-patient treatment day , ( iv ) Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score ≥24 , ( v ) able provide inform consent . Patients continue regular psychotropic medication prescribe consultant psychiatrist . This reflect condition adjunctive ketamine would use routine clinical practice , thereby enhance generalisability external validity future definitive trial . Exclusion criterion : condition render patient medically unfit general anaesthesia , ECT ketamine ; active suicidal intention ; dementia ; lifetime history bipolar disorder , post traumatic stress disorder , Axis 1 diagnosis ; ECT previous six-months ; alcohol/substance abuse previous six-months ; pregnancy ; inability/refusal consent . Patients give verbal full write information ask provide write informed consent . INTERVENTIONS : Please see description OUTCOMES Process outcomes The focus pilot trial 's outcome trial process assessment primary clinical outcome secondary pilot design measure efficacy . Process outcomes inform future definitive ketamine relapse prevention trial include information following : - recruitment method rate - willingness participant randomise - willingness participant complete assessment - randomisation - success blind - ability administer course ketamine infusion - medical safety acceptability ketamine infusion ECT responder population - rate adverse dissociative psychiatric event - adherence allocate treatment - adherence follow-up - reason drop-out treatment - reason drop-out follow-up - 95 % confidence interval difference ketamine midazolam group six-month relapse rate help power calculation future definitive trial Clinical outcome : The follow use obtain baseline , intra-treatment , end-of-treatment follow-up data . Most standard measure use others depression , ECT ketamine study . Raters train measure recruitment begin . ( ) Diagnosis treatment history : Diagnosis major depressive disorder confirm use mood episode module Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I Disorders ( SCID ) . The Columbia Antidepressant Treatment History Form ( ATHF ) use obtain index episode treatment detail provide measure treatment-resistance . Handedness record Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire . The National Adult Reading Test ( NART ) measure premorbid ability . Additional baseline data patient interview case-note review include age , sex , weight , height , occupation , educational attainment , duration index depressive episode , number previous depressive episode , previous ECT , history medical illness surgical treatment , personal family history alcohol/substance dependency , presence psychotic symptom ( detected SCID ) , current medication therapy . Changes medication Phases 1 2 document follow-up interview . ( ii ) Depression outcomes : The primary clinical outcome measure relapse rate six month measure use objectively-rated 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD-24 ) . To enter Phase 1 patient must score ≥21 . Response ECT define achieve ≥60 % decrease baseline HRSD-24 score ≤16 two consecutive weekly rating . Remission criterion ≥60 % decrease HRSD baseline score ≤10 two consecutive weekly rating . Criteria relapse ≥10 point increase HRSD-24 compare baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD ≥16 ; addition , increase HRSD maintain one week later ( indicate , additional follow-up arrange ) . Hospital admission , ECT , deliberate self-harm/suicide also constitute relapse . Timing event record . Patients must achieve least response participate Phase 2 pilot trial . Baseline weekly intra-treatment course HRSD-24 score obtain treatment period Phases 1 2 . During infusion session Phase 2 HRSD-24 score obtain 60 minute infusion begin +120 +240 minute afterwards . Baseline score sleep appetite item maintain repeated measure within one day . The +240 HRSD-24 score serve weekly post-ECT score follow-up-week 4 . Depression measure repeat week 6 , 8 , 12 , 20 26 six-month follow-up . Subjective mood rating measure timepoints use Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms , self-report version ( QIDS-SR16 ) . ( iii ) Cognitive outcome : Cognitive test challenge severely depressed patient . It vital patient encourage remain trial throughout whole study period great deal tact require raters . Priority give obtain score HRSD-24 . In recent meta-analysis identify ECT pronounce subacute ( i.e . 0-3 day post course ) adverse effect upon verbal memory ( delay word list recall ) frontal executive function . Subanaesthetic dos ketamine cause problem orientation , concentration , work episodic memory resolve within two hour begin infusion . There publish data effect ketamine cognition ECT responder . We use follow battery Phase 1 ( pre post ECT course ; latter serve baseline Phase 2 ) Phase 2 ( one day first fourth infusion six-months ) . Parallel version use reduce practice effect . 1 . Global cognition assess revise Addenbrooke 's Cognitive Examination ( ACE-R ; three parallel version ) also generate Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) verbal fluency score . The ACE-R provide total score ( maximum=100 ) plus subscale score different aspect cognition use study cognition depression ECT . 2 . Forward Backward Digit Spans - immediate short-term memory , attention work memory 3 . Trail Making Test ( Part A ) - motor psychomotor speed 4 . Frontal-executive function rat Trail Making Test ( Part B ) plus letter category verbal fluency . 5 . Anterograde verbal memory test use Free Cued Selective Reminding Test variant ( immediate delay recall ) Buschke Selective Reminding Test . 6 . To measure retrograde amnesia autobiographical information use Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview ( K-AMI ) , The K-AMI administer pre post ECT , fourth ketamine infusion , six month . ( iv ) Ketamine psychotomimetic effect adverse event : Acute psychotomimetic effect ketamine usually short-lived restricted infusion period , resolve within one hour . They include dissociative psychiatric symptom . In line previous ketamine trial measure dissociative effect Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) , psychotomimetic effect Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ; four-item positive symptom subscale ) , mood elevation Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ; mood item ) . These effect measure , ( +35-40 min ) ( +240 min ) ketamine infusion . The Patient-Rated Inventory Side Effects use document general adverse event patient time point . All adverse medical , psychotomimetic general event report Trial Steering Data Monitoring Committees . STATISTICAL METHODS A formal sample size calculation appropriate pilot trial . Pilot trial data analyse intention-to-treat basis patient complete least one infusion . Data analysis perform blinded allocation .</detailed_description>
