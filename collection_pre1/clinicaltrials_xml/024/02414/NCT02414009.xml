	<brief_title>Study Compare CAPTEM vs FOLFIRI Second Line Treatment Advanced , Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third commonly diagnosed cancer male second female , 1.2 million new cancer case 608,700 death estimate occurred 2008 . Approximately 35 % CRC patient present Stage IV metastatic disease time diagnosis , 20 % −50 % Stage II III disease progress Stage IV point course disease . Stage IV CRC carry dismal prognosis : 5-year survival rate &lt; 10 % , median survival time patient give optimal supportive care without chemotherapy approximately 5 month . Hypothesis/rationale In advanced CRC , occurrence chemo- refractory disease pose major therapeutic challenge presence adequate performance status potentially receive treatment , absence effective drug may offer patient evidence-based algorithm . Patients progress approve treatment may generally consider suitable new investigational drug strategy . Thus , era personalize medicine , tumor molecular profiling may lead identification therapeutic target predictive biomarkers pharmacological intervention . The DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) responsible elimination alkyl group O6-position guanine . If inactive , may involve early step colorectal tumorigenesis increase mutational rate particularly , G-to-A point mutation KRAS gene . Epigenetic silence MGMT colorectal tumorigenesis associate hypermethylation CpG island promoter . This transcriptional gene silence responsible diminished DNA-repair O6-alkylguanine adduct , consequence enhance chemosensitivity alkylating agent particular dacarbazine oral prodrug temozolomide . In previous phase II study , investigator show temozolomide induced objective response rate RECIST criterion 12 % heavily pretreated patient advanced CRC MGMT promoter 6 methylation . Treatment well tolerate , grade 4 toxicity one thrombocytopenia episode ( 3 % ) . The trial meet primary end point acceptable response rate , disease control rate 31 % , median PFS ( progression free survival ) OS ( overall survival ) 1.8 8.4 month , respectively . Other study carcinoid cell line demonstrate synergistic cell kill 5-FU ( 5-fluorouracil ) TMZ ( temozolomide ) deliver schedule-dependent manner . From translational study , formulate CAPTEM regimen use TMZ 5 day 150-200 mg/m2/day total daily dose day 10-14 ( give BID oral dosing ) , capecitabine 750 mg/m2 PO ( per OS ) BID day 1-14 28-day cycle . The use TMZ BID ( BIS DIE ) dose instead daily dose do first dose bind 6-MGMT level , thus allow second dose methylate guanine decrease repair MGMT . Given potential synergy CAPTEM combination CRC , investigator plan randomize study second-line CAPTEM vs. FOLFIRI failure prior first-line oxaliplatin - base treatment . Study design Open-label , randomize , multicenter , Phase II trial design estimate efficacy CAPTEM versus FOLFIRI second line treatment MGMT methylated , RAS mutate advanced CRC patient progress first-line oxaliplatin contain chemotherapy metastatic disease . MGMT assess centrally Pathology Department Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori prior enrollment . A minimum ten 3-micron unstained section charge slide tumor require methylation status provide within maximum seven day Study Centers . Presence RAS mutation assess local participating center . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio one two treatment arm : - Arm A ( experimental arm ) : CAPTEM - Arm B ( control arm ) : FOLFIRI Study treatment give cycle repeat every 28 day Arm A every 14 day Arm B . Patients Arm A receive capecitabine oral dose 1500 mg/mq/die bid day 1 day 14 every 28 day plus temozolomide 150 mg/mq/die bid start day 10 14 every 28 day . Patients Arm B receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy start Day 1 q2w ( every cycle ) start Day 1 Cycle 1 . FOLFIRI consist irinotecan ( start dose 180 mg/m2 ) day one ; 5-FU 7 ( start bolus 22-hour infusional dos 400 mg/m2 600 mg/m2 , respectively ) , leucovorin ( racemic , start dose 200 mg/m2 L-form , start dose 100 mg/m2 ) two consecutive day . Treatment continue 6 cycle Arm A 12 cycle Arm B disease progression , unacceptable toxicity inform consent withdrawal . Randomization stratify across treatment arm follow predefined stratification variable : disease progression within 9 month start first-line oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy ( &lt; vs. ≥9 month ) ; prior bevacizumab combination oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ( yes vs. ) . Efficacy assessment perform every 2 cycle Arm A every 4 cycle Arm B progression . The study expect enrol approximately 82 patient meet eligibility criterion . Number study centre 10 center Italy Primary objective correspond end point - To evaluate efficacy , measure progression-free survival , FOLFIRI ( administer every 2 week ) versus CAPTEM ( administer four-weekly ) Secondary objective correspond end point - To evaluate activity two regimen , measure response rate ; secondary efficacy endpoint also include duration response overall survival FOLFIRI ( administer every 2 week ) versus CAPTEM ( administer four-weekly ) - To evaluate safety FOLFIRI versus CAPTEM - To assess quality life measure Quality life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ - CR29 ; QLQ-C30 ) Statistical methodology According publish result GERCOR study , median progression-free survival second-line treatment crossover FOLFOX FOLFIRI 2.3 month ( calculated start second-line treatment FOLFIRI ) .
