	<brief_title>Percutaneous HydroDiscectomy Compared TESI Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniation one leading cause low back pain sciatica . If conservative management fails relieve radiculopathy secondary lumbar disc herniation , interventional treatment epidural steroid injection indicate . Patients pain relief transforaminal epidural steroid injection time relief diminish , surgical intervention typically recommend microdiscectomy surgical intervention choice . Over year , number minimally invasive technique lumbar disc herniation introduce include percutaneous mechanical lumbar discectomy , include percutaneous hydrodiscectomy ( HydroD ) . The purpose study compare outcome HydroD SpineJet Hydrodiscectomy System transforaminal epidural steroid injection ( TESI ) patient lumbar radiculopathy due contain disc herniation fail course conservative management include anti-inflammatory medication physical therapy . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio Percutaneous Hydrodiscectomy Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injections . Patients randomized TESI group fail &gt; 50 % relief pain two course TESI injection space two week apart within 2 month procedure , provide option cross-over HydroD group follow follow-up visit . If cross-over HydroD group fail &gt; 50 % relief pain initial intervention within 2 month procedure , refer surgery participation study end . Patients randomize HydroD group fail &gt; 50 % relief pain initial procedure , within 2 month procedure , provide option cross-over TESI group . If cross-over TESI group fail &gt; 50 % relief pain two course TESI injection space two week apart within 2 month procedure , refer surgery longer follow study . Patients follow 1 , 4 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 month post-procedure . Outcomes assessment include NRS pain , ODI , neurological independent physician evaluation .</detailed_description>
