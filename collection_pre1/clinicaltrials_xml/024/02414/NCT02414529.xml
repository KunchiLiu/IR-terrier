	<detailed_description>Participation involve 3 visit ( 6 week apart ) Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) , happen 2-3 week consent participate study . The total duration study time you/your child spend CTSI 2.5 hour visit . Number adolescents/children enroll study:20 . Visit 1 A doctor perform complete physical examination . The child his/her weight height measure .Blood pressure vital sign check visit . Of 2 hour spent hospital , 1/2 hour allocate get measurement , weight , vitals put intravenous line draw fast lab . The oral glucose tolerance test take 2 hour . To test insulin sensitivity ( Risk marker Diabetes ) , oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) do . OGTT use diagnose Diabetes Pre Diabetes . The child first blood sample draw , drink oral glucose soda . Blood sample obtain 2 hour . A total 5-7 teaspoon , 25-35 cc blood take test . Of 15 cc draw OGTT . A doctor nurse monitoring child throughout test . If he/she develop low blood sugar , treat appropriately glucose . Blood sample obtain start OGTT use measure various marker insulin sensitivity , vitamin D level marker bone health vitamin D deficiency causebone loss . This blood store CTSI core laboratory CTSI duration study . The blood sample store without child 's name identify information . The sample destroy study complete . After OGTT do , child receive one time high dose vitamin D ( group A ) placebo ( capsule contain medication ) ( Group B ) . This way treat low vitamin D level one time high dose vitamin D safe study adolescent . The child 50/50 chance either group . Neither he/she know he/she get Vit D placebo . At week 7 , child need return CTSI 2nd study physical check-up , blood test urine test use method 1st visit . The urine test do test urinary calcium could sign vitamin D toxicity . After 2nd study do , child reassign alternate treatment group receive either vitamin D placebo . That mean he/she get placebo first visit he/she get real Vit D time . If he/she get vit D first visit , he/she get placebo visit . At week 12 completion 2nd course medication , child come back final blood urine study use method first 2nd study . At child oral glucose tolerance test , blood urine test . The urine test do test urinary calcium could sign vitamin D toxicity . If child high urine calcium he/she allow participate study We guarantee child receive treatment lack vitamin D either first half latter half study . However , know medication child receive entire study . We set appointment see u 2weeks Endocrine clinic ; however , part study . We go result study time see treatment Vitamin D require adolescent . You child come back CTSI end week 12 post-therapy study . After minimum 10-hour fast , participant come CTSI , child his/her weight height measure . Blood Pressure measure . Post vitamin D therapy OGTT . Vitamin D level marker bone health measure use method day 1 . Urine collect urinary calcium level , use method day 1 .</detailed_description>
