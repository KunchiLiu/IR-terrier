	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well trastuzumab emtansine work treat old patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive stage I-III breast cancer . HER2 protein find surface cancer cell help grow spread . Trastuzumab emtansine may kill cancer cell bind HER2-positive surface tumor cell block ability grow spread .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) , define occurrence follow : ipsilateral invasive breast cancer recurrence , regional invasive breast cancer recurrence , distant recurrence , death attributable cause , contralateral invasive breast cancer , second non-breast invasive cancer . Note : In-situ event include . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival ( OS ) . II . Recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) . III . Adverse event . IV . Cardiac function/adverse event . V. Site first recurrence . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . The association adverse event outcomes follow examine : geriatric assessment ( GA ) , patient report outcome ( Patient-Reported Outcomes Version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event [ PRO-CTCAE ] ) , quality life ( QOL ) , biomarkers age . II . To determine whether clinician-reported CTCAEs accurate PRO-CTCAE data share patient clinician . III . Utilize high-throughput mutation profile system ( Oncomap ) query large panel cancer gene mutation old patient HER2-positive breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6-12 month yearly 4 year .</detailed_description>
