	<brief_title>IVIg Treatment-Related Fluctuations CIDP Patients Using Daily Grip Strength Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit individual site investigator . Prior enrollment potential subject screen data review panel medical expert confirmation inclusion criterion . Each reviewer independent , board-certified , practice experienced neurologist special interest CIDP . Enrolled subject provide informed consent instruct perform document daily Jamar hand-held Dynamometer grip strength measurement paper diary 6 month time frame . Weekly nursing visit capture disability assessment , physical test , adverse event concomitant medication assessment , clinical change may affect grip strength measurement . Nurses review subject capture grip data paper diary iPad weekly home assessment . Nurses also administer HRQOL Short-Form ( SF ) 36 questionnaire baseline , week 12 week 24 study visit . Serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) level capture home study nurse three time point surround IVIg infusion classify either trough , peak , mid . Each subject serum Ig collect blood draw first 4 IVIg treatment cycle , total 12 blood draw per subject . The `` trough '' serum IgG level collect immediately prior Ig infusion . The `` peak '' serum IgG level collect 5 minute post-Ig infusion . The `` mid '' serum IgG level collect two week post-Ig infusion . There currently know biomarkers assist CIDP diagnosis , prognosis , treatment optimization . As part study , subject require additional blood take stored future use . Future use may include possible discovery specific biomarkers predict response IVIg therapy , optimization IVIg dosage base pharmacodynamics , pathogenesis CIDP , effective CIDP diagnostic marker . Blood take future use obtain serum IgG sample . No additional blood draw require . Should IVIg therapy discontinue study , daily grip strength measurement continue perform recorded subject diary 30 day end study , whichever come first . Weekly nurse visit collection disability assessment serum IgG blood draw continue 4 home nurse visit end study , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
