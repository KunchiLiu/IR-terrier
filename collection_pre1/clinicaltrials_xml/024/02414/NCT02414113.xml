	<brief_summary>Before consider high-GVHD Negative Outcome Score ( GNOS ) donor selection routine clinical practice , blind prospective study carry assessment severe GVHD ( graft-versus-host-disease ) reduction associate select high-GNOS donor allogeneic hematopoietic peripheral blood stem cell transplant . The objective prospective study show : ( ) GVHD reduction donor availability observe retrospective study also apply prospective sample collect process on-going matched unrelated transplant , ( b ) high-GNOS donor selection readily fit today 's donor selection process , facilitate access benefit GVHD reduction . The prospective study design blind , involve specific donor selection influence clinical management decision make application GNOS technology . To determine GNOS model perform good others across different clinical center , across different recipient / donor attribute , 4 different specific GNOS model evaluate . Bootstrap computational analysis carry retrospective data 4 GNOS model test validated prospective study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluation GVHD Negative Outcome Score ( GNOS ) Matched Unrelated Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment recipient occur prior unrelated donor search haploidentical donor identification . FOR UNRELATED DONORS : When unrelated donor search formalize , study team submit study participation request document NMDP potential donor evaluate enrolled recipient . These document relay appropriate donor center NMDP . This document inform donor center potential donor 's participation trial request . The donor center approach potential donor participation trial . If potential donor consent participate , require donor study sample obtain shipped appropriate lab . This conclude potential donor 's physical participation trial . The donor consent keep donor center provide investigator . FOR HAPLOIDENTICAL DONORS : Haploidentical donor identify transplant team care recipient , follow site 's standard procedure identification , HLA typing , medical clearance stem cell donation . Haploidentical donor approach transplant team study coordinator participation trial . If potential donor consent participate , require donor study sample obtain shipped appropriate lab processing prior start growth factor stem cell mobilization prior stem cell collection via bone marrow harvest . FOR ALL DONORS : At time HLA confirmatory typing , 24 mL whole blood collect donor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Prior Unrelated Donor Search / Haploidentical Donor Identification : Recipient must 18 70 year age , inclusive Recipient must undergo unrelated haploidentical stem cell donor search one potential donor request confirmatory type study sample . Recipient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document Eligibility Criteria Day 0 : Selected donor must agree participate trial sample GNOS must receive process . If MUD donor , select donor must Cantigen mismatch recipient ( Callele mismatch donorrecipient pair eligible ) . Recipient must receive alemtuzumab part stem cell condition regimen . Recipient must undergo transplantation ex vivo Tcell deplete stem cell . If MUD donor , recipient must receive myeloblative stem cell conditioning ( MAC ) regimen per CIBMTR ( Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ) criterion . Patients receive low intensity , nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen exclude . If haploidentical donor , recipient must receive standard MAC RICconditioning posttransplant Cytoxan GVHD prophylaxis give Days +3 +4 . Enrollment occur prior unrelated donor search . Following donor selection , recipient meet eligibility criterion list Day 0 recipient proceed stem cell transplantation within 12 month enrollment , donor/recipient pair nonevaluable study objective . Nonevaluable donor/recipient pair remove trial replaced .</criteria>
