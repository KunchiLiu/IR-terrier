	<detailed_description>This phase III , Multi Centre , Open Label , Randomized , Study Assess Efficacy Safety AZD9291 ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) Combination MEDI4736 ( 10 mg/kg ( IV ) infusion q2w ) versus AZD9291 Monotherapy ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) patient confirm diagnosis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) T790M mutation positive NSCLC , progress follow prior therapy approve Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) agent . The randomization stratify previous line treatment ( 2nd 3rd+ ) ethnicity ( Asian Non-Asian ) . A mandatory biopsy need central test T790M mutation status follow confirm disease progression recent treatment regimen . The primary objective study assess efficacy AZD9291 combination MEDI4736 versus AZD9291 monotherapy assessment Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) investigator accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Approximately 350 patient evaluated consist 2 population : 1 . 2nd line : patient progress follow approve first-line EGFR-TKI treatment receive treatment . 2 . 3rd line high : patient progress follow prior therapy approve EGFR-TKI additional anti-cancer treatment . Patients may also receive additional line treatment .</detailed_description>
