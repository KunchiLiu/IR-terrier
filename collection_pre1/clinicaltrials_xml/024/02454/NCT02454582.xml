	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive method measurement blood flow tissue , first use cerebral tissue oxygenation 1977 . 1 NIRS spectroscopic technique , use electromagnetic wave ( 700-950nm ) , emitter detector . In last 20 year enormous development instrumentation application NIRS . This technique allow measure oxygenation brain tissue . 2-13 The INVOS Brain Oxymeter ( IBO ) reliable trend monitor change regional cerebral oxygenation ( rSO2 ) correlate hemoglobin saturation venous , capillary arterial blood , use algorithm base upon Beer-Lambert law . 4,14 The IBO system use light , wavelengths 730-810 nm , penetrate layer human body , among skin , scull brain . It either scatter within tissue absorb present chromophore . In rather transparent near infrared region , many absorb light chromophore , three important far oxygenation concern , namely hemoglobin ( HbO2 ) , deoxyhemoglobin ( Hb ) cytochrome oxidase ( CtOx ) . Oxygenated deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light different wavelength , allow differentiation two form hemoglobin.15 The sensor , ( `` SomaSensors '' ) , apply patient 's forehead integrate medical-grade adhesive.16 The method apply use two source-detector distance sensor : `` near '' one ( shallow ) , 3 cm source `` far '' one ( deep ) , 4 cm source . Both sample penetrate tissue beneath light source equally well , difference 4cm source-detector measure signal deeper brain.8,17 The subtraction near sample far one leave signal originate predominantly brain cortex . 16 The proper management brain oxygenation essential component anaesthesiologic procedure . Nevertheless , brain remain one least monitor organ perioperative phase intensive care therapy . Up , anaesthesiological application NIRS method measure cerebral oxygenation investigate patient undergo cardiac surgery cerebrovascular surgery , elderly patient undergo major abdominal surgery neonatal infant . 18-21 These study indicate measure cerebral oxygenation affect relative proportion blood arterial venous part capillary bed , hemoglobin concentration systemic saturation addition cardiac output . The precise consequence alteration systemic saturation ( SaO2 ) cerebral oxygenation ( rSO2 ) remain unknown . It current assumption rSO2 directly associate Sa02 , increase SaO2 also lead increase rSO2 . The amount oxygen arterial blood depends inspire oxygen pulmonary gas exchange . These two parameter primarily affect individual 's respiratory ventilation . Patients chronic respiratory failure , temporary ( acute ) breathing deficiency ( e.g . general anesthesia ) , routinely treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . It also commonly use treatment sleep apnea neonate ( especially premature infant ) . In patient CPAP ventilation may prevent need tracheal ( re- ) intubation , enable early extubation . CPAP therapy develop Dr. George Gregory colleague neonatal ICU University California , San Francisco 1971 22 , modify Professor Colin Sullivan Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Sydney , Australia , 1981 . 23 Initially CPAP therapy mainly use treatment obstructive sleep apnea home . Nowadays commonly applied ICUs form non-invasive mechanical ventilation . There usually reserve subgroups patient oxygen treatment via facemask insufficient . Patients CPAP therapy closely monitor ICU set . The treatment support patient 's spontaneous breathe building positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) . The pressure require patient range 5 12 cmH2O . The patient individually determine respiratory frequency well depth respiration . Objectives : The primary study goal investigation effect CPAP therapy rSO2 relation vital parameter , hemoglobin , SaO2 ( analyze BGA ) SpO2 . These combined measurement use describe effect CPAP therapy rSO2 . So far , kind study perform patient ICU . Therefore , project aim gain new insight influence CPAP therapy cerebral saturation . Additionally , difference SaO2 vital parameter correlate rSO2 . Also occurrence vomit nausea , headache agitation CPAP therapy register . The following parameter measure , calculate note CRF ( case report form ) : - Blood pressure ( BP ) - Heart rate ( HR ) rhythm - rSO2 ( left right hemisphere ) - BGA : arterial partial pressure oxygen ( PaO2 ) - BGA : pH , Electrolytes ( Na , K , Ca ) , Glucose , Lactate , SaO2 - BGA : Hb , Hk , MetHb , CoHb , SO2 , pCO2 , BE , SBC - Ventilation : CPAP , MV , RR , TV , pressure support , Pmean - ASA classification : 1-6 - Physical disorder CPAP yes , yes specify : eye , ear , nose , throat respiratory cardiovascular musculoskeletal genitourinary skin endocrine neurological psychiatric Hypothesis Null alternate hypothesis : H0 : There NO change rSO2 CPAP therapy . H1 : There A change rSO2 CPAP therapy . Type-I -II error power α = 0.05 Power = 0.9 Interim analysis - Statistical methodology Randomized observational experimental single-center clinical trial . - Sample size calculation : Paired t-test , mean difference : 5 % , SD difference : 10 % ; Effect size 0.5 ; error probability two-sided : 0.05 ; Power : 0.9 ; total sample size : 50 patient . ( 5 % drop-out rate include ) . METHODS This randomize clinical study include 50 subject 18 year onwards undergoing treatment ICU Medical University Vienna ( 13C1 , 13C2 , 13C3 , 13B1 , 13I1 , 9D , E11 ( Neurosurgical ICU ) , require intermittent CPAP therapy . Neither applicant , clinical investigator involve decision indication CPAP therapy . The study carry accord Declaration Helsinki ( 1964 ) , good clinical practice ( GCP ) guideline , Equator network website recommendation include current revision . The study protocol submit Ethics Committee Medical University Vienna ethical approval . The study register clinicaltrials.gov . The participation clinical study occur independently medical indication patient 's stay ICU . Before admitted study , subject must consent participate , nature , scope possible consequence procedure explain form understandable . The patient must give consent orally write . The individual 's consent confirm signature investigator . All subject name keep secret investigator ' file . Subjects identify documentation evaluation throughout number allot study . The participant inform entire study data store handle confidentially . A data protocol mean case report form use . The duration trial 30min . The study start 15min CPAP end patient 's rSO2 reach steady state ( change rSO2 ± 2 % 3 min , maximal 15min ) CPAP therapy . The participant require participate follow visit . This study carry patient good access forehead . The NIRS measurement ( IBO ) perform frontal cortex side head . Emission detection probe connect wipe patient forehead soft cloth cotton pad . During whole investigation SaO2 , blood pressure ( continuously invasive non invasive 3 minute-intervals ) ECG record . These vital sign part routine ICU monitoring . The trial consist two part i.e . without ventilatory assistance . The order start study without CPAP therapy randomize . During part measurement perform reach steady state ( change rSO2 ± 2 % 3 min ) maximum duration 15min . The examination safe , non-invasive , pain-free carry flexibly , quickly cost efficiently portable equipment . Data collect right left hemisphere . The device system use accordance approve investigational plan CE-Certificate , subject receive CPAP therapy sign informed consent form . The use device limit approve study investigator . After examination interval BGA perform . The reason study conduct ICU patient follow . Patients suffer respiratory deficiency need ventilatory assistance rarely locate normal hospital ward due fact installation ventilatory machine additional CPAP mode perform specialized personnel . In addition , patient require close monitoring , guarantee ICU set . Pregnant woman , well individual severe valvular neurological disease include observation study . After indication CPAP-therapy verify in- exclusion criterion check , patient recruit study . The study divide two data collection part , take one session . 1 . 15min CPAP : - start collect data either continuous arterial blood pressure measurement ( ABP ) - non invasive ( NIBP ) end study - start NIRS measurement brain hemisphere ( INVOS 5100C ) procedure complete - draw arterial venous ( accord available access ) blood sample blood gas analysis ( BGA ) 2 . 15min CPAP : - measurement perform point 1 . ( ABP/NIBP , NIRS ) continue - take another arterial venous ( accord available line ) blood sample BGA The order point 1. 2 . ( without CPAP ) randomize group 1 group 2 patient .
