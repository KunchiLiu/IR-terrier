	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate impact new injection-free six-to-nine month treatment regimen linezolid , bedaquiline , levofloxacin , pyrazinamide ( PZA ) ethionamide/high dose isoniazid ( INH ) compare conventional empiric injection-based regimen 21-24 month treatment . The secondary aim determine treatment-related outcome include adverse event , adherence treatment , culture conversion , cure/completion significantly different intervention conventional arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label RCT Evaluate New Treatment Regimen Patients With Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : TB completely control South Africa officially common cause death country . Alarmingly , gravity pandemic compound emergence multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) , constitute resistance two potent anti-tuberculous drug , namely rifampicin isoniazid . XDR-TB refers resistance rifampicin , isoniazid , fluoroquinolone , second line injectable drug ( amikacin , kanamycin , capreomycin ) . MDR-TB burgeon epidemic South Africa , rate treble last decade . It considerable concern mortality high ( 50 % South Africa ) often affect economically active young adult . It also major threat health care worker South Africa . We recently show rate SA health care worker 6 fold high general population exacerbate shortage critical workforce country . The increase cost manage disease unsustainable . Although drug-resistant TB comprise less 2 % total caseload country ( approximately ½ million patient TB treat per year ) , consume almost 40 % total national TB programme budget , 60 % total TB drug budget . This sustainable drug-resistant TB therefore capacity destabilise functional TB control program many country Africa . The current treatment MDR-TB arduous , six eight month intensive phase daily painful injection Kanamycin combine oral pyrazinamide , fluoroquinolone ( moxifloxacin levofloxacin ) , prothionamide either cycloserine para-aminosalicylic acid ( cycloserine use ) . Treatment continue 18 month consecutive negative sputum culture , last least 20 month . There substantial drug-associated toxicity adverse event frequently lead interruption cessation treatment . This study propose test efficacy new drug regimen treatment MDR-TB short term duration contain injectable drug , thus make treatment easy administer thereby potentially increase compliance . All drug available NTP study show successful . This regimen comprise linezolid , bedaquiline , levofloxacin , PZA either ethionamide high dose INH teridazone . A gene-directed diagnostic approach ( mutational analysis ) use interventional arm individualise therapy inform use high dose INH versus ethionamide . If mutation present administer teridazone . Furthermore , propose study key aim test regimen ( rather individual drug ) look outcome ( 24 month ) , include treatment completion/cure ( i.e . treatment success primary outcome ) mortality , impact . It expect introduction shorten effective regimen reduce drop drastically reduce mortality on-going transmission . Moreover , rate XDR-TB TDR-TB may also decline . The study conduct 5 trial site South Africa designate MDR-TB treatment facility many case patient recruit satellite clinic centre reflect decentralize MDR-TB program . All site necessary expertise facility carry propose study . The study fully conceive fund within South Africa .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnose culture and/or GeneXpert positive pulmonary TB . Rifampicin resistance detect use least two susceptibility test assay ( GeneXpert , HainMTBDRplus phenotypic ) use sputum sample screening . Provide write informed consent prior trialrelated procedure include HIV test . Male female age 18 year old . Body weight 40 90 kg , inclusive . Women nonchildbearing potential participant either sex use willing use effective method birth control A participant opinion investigator unlikely cope regular visit trial site either travel constraint , drug alcohol abuse , reason . Known screen XDRTB preXDRTB ( i.e . fluoroquinolone secondline injectable drug ( SLID ) resistance i.e . capreomycin , amikacin kanamycin ) . Previous history treatment MDRTB XDRTB previous treatment bedaquiline . Currently MDRTB treatment 2 week . Any participant Karnofsky score &lt; 50 . Known allergy trial drug related substance . Having participate clinical study within 8 week prior trial start investigational agent use may potentially impact current trial outcome . Presence ( evidence ) symptomatic neuropathy grade 3 high . Epilepsy drug prolong QT interval use . Participant pregnant , breastfeed ( willing stop ) , plan conceive child within 6 month cessation treatment . Incompatibility microbiological clinical/ radiological finding ( i.e . clinical and/or radiological finding discordant microbiological test suggest laboratory contamination ) . Participants ECG abnormality , particular QT prolongation . Any preexist laboratory abnormality opinion investigator place participant risk . Patients follow baseline laboratory abnormality exclude study : Creatinine grade 2 worse ( &gt; 1.4 time ULN ) Hemoglobin level grade 4 ( HB &lt; 6.5g/dL ) Platelets grade 3 worse ( &lt; 49999 x 109/L ) ALT grade 3 worse ( &gt; 5 time ULN ) Total bilirubin grade 3 worse ( &gt; 2.5 time ULN ) Specific prior concurrent medication/treatments ( see Restrictions section , Table 3 ) . Rifampicin monoresistant TB . Fluoroquinolone and/or SLID resistance . Although South Africa , standard care single MDRTB fluoroquinolone aminoglycoside resistance initiation MDRTB treatment , study Hain MTBDRsl LPA use sputum sample exclude preXDR XDR case participation study ( result LPA phenotypic DST test isolate available 36 week later ) . All inclusion exclusion criterion must meet prior enrolment randomisation . Whenever investigator reason suspect might health problem ( TB ) participation consider discuss case medical monitor . Note : Participants currently , previously drugsensitive TB treatment exclude participation . Postrandomisation exclusion criterion : • Fluoroquinolone and/or SLID resistance detect DST use isolate . Note : A woman fall pregnant treatment phase trial exclude counsel regard potential termination pregnancy .</criteria>
