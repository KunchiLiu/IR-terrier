	<brief_title>HOME FIRST Pilot : Study Early Supported Discharge Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised interventional clinical care pathway study early support discharge ( termed 'HOME FIRST ' ) versus standard hospital care patient hospitalise LRTI . HOME FIRST provide co-ordinated multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) care , provision 24hr emergency telephone cover , access fully train respiratory study nurse ( ) study doctor ( ) . The HOME FIRST MDT consist : - Study doctor ( trained respiratory physician - consultant senior SpRs ) - Highly trained respiratory specialist nursing staff - Close link physiotherapist ( mobility respiratory ) - Home help provision ( temporary assistance ADLs carers ) may include occupational therapy social worker involvement ( HOME FIRST fast access meals-on-wheels ) - Close link pharmacy rapid dispense discharge medication . Patients hospitalise LRTI Royal Liverpool Broadgreen ( RLBUHT ) Teaching Hospitals October 2012 April 2014 approach . Patients ( next kin patient unable give inform consent ) offer participation study fit strict inclusion/exclusion criterion . They randomise receive HOME FIRST standard hospital care ( SHC ) . The investigator aim recruit 25 patient arm study . Patients randomise HOME FIRST care initially receive twice daily respiratory specialist nurse visit first 48 hour . After time period , frequency duration visit depend clinical need . The study nurse establish need involvement MDT team member . Laboratory test perform clinically indicate discretion study team . Venepuncture perform fully train research staff clinical purpose need HOME FIRST limb : patient SHC limb frequency venepuncture depend clinical assessment need regular medical team . Patients randomised standard hospital care ( SHC ) - All management discharge decision make patient 's usual hospital team . Clinical test perform discretion medical team . If significant concern clinical issue note study team 's visit , usual medical team alert . All patient discuss weekly case-note MDT meeting . All patient followed-up discharge 'Respiratory Infection ' out-patient clinic ( patient 's home necessary ) 6 week , repeat chest X-ray need .</detailed_description>
