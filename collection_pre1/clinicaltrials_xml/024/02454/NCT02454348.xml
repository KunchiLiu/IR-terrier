	<detailed_description>Sepsis , systemic host response invasion pathogenic microorganism , may progress severe sepsis , wherein patient experience acute dysfunction least one organ system , develop septic shock patient regain adequate systemic blood pressure perfusion adequate appropriate fluid resuscitation . The exact societal burden severe sepsis septic shock difficult quantify : million individual industrialized develop nation experience syndrome year , best medical center world achieve 22 % mortality rate severe sepsis , caregiver well patient endure long-lasting impact care love one survive severe sepsis . Recently , impactful work perform Rivers colleague establish early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) standard care patient severe sepsis septic shock compare usual care three international trial . The result trial suggest usual care effective EGDT , necessitate new research conduct component EGDT determine extent specific therapy safe effective . One key aspect provision care patient septic shock time initiation choice vasoactive agent . This study investigate use norepinephrine vasopressin versus norepinephrine alone initial vasoactive regimen critically ill adult patient septic shock .</detailed_description>
