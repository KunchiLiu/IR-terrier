	<detailed_description>Methods : The investigator use ischemic stroke TCM syndromes Diagnostic Scale ( ISTCMDS ) Meridian Energy Analysis Device ( M.E.A.D . ) objectively analyze diagnostic element detect deficiency excess performance meridian acute ischemic stroke patient Stroke Center Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital . The onset stroke set Within 7 day , investigator expect collect 300 patient . The investigator initially establish scientific epidemiological study acute ischemic stroke TCM syndromes deficiency excess meridian performance statistical analysis become standard Chinese Western medicine integration .
