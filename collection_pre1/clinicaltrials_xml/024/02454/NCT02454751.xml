	<brief_title>The Use Intranasal Fentanyl Treatment Incident Dyspnea Congestive Heart Failure : A Prospective Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical question hypothesis In patient congestive heart failure experience episodic activity-induced dyspnea ( incident dyspnea ) , administration intranasal fentanyl pre-activity result subjective improvement dyspnea objective improvement functional capacity ? Will side effect treatment ? We expect pre-activity treatment intranasal fentanyl result subjective improvement dyspnea rating well increase measurement functional capacity . We also suspect treatment increase patient 's experienced side effect . Study Objective The primary object study investigate safety effectiveness fentanyl management incident dyspnea . Study Design The study design cross study minimum one hour wash period . Participation study 2 hour 1-2 day . Primary Endpoints â€¢ Walking distance 6MWT Secondary Endpoints - Subjective rating dyspnea side effect - Heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation participant ' general appearance . Sample Size We hope study 20 patient . Given paucity data far , possible statistically calculate appropriate power study 20 patient approximation base clinical experience . There enough data available currently statistician find power calculation eliminate type 1 2 error . Based anecdotal evidence experience medication clinical setting , estimate number need determine clinically relevant difference likely around 20 . Patient Population We study application fentanyl patient age 18 older , either gender , either diagnosis NYHA Class 3 4 heart failure . Inclusion Criteria - Patients must experience activity-induced incident dyspnea without reversible cause . They would control background dyspnea without opioids . - Patients must physically able safely ambulate order complete 6MWT ( may mobility device may use supplement oxygen prescribe pre-study ) . Exclusion Criteria - Patients unable perform 6MWT reason contraindication perform 6MWT - Patients anatomical pathology would make intranasal administration impossible - Patients know allergies/sensitivities fentanyl/sufentanil Withdrawal Criteria Participants may voluntarily withdraw study time feel uncomfortable protocol . They also withdraw experience chest pain , palpitation , syncope , presyncope , worsen dyspnea . Objectively , withdraw blood pressure drop 90/50 , heart rate drop 60 rise 100 , oxygen saturation drop 90 % , respiratory rate drop 8 rise 20 . If : oxygen saturation , blood pressure , respiratory rate drop cut point recover within 5 min rest , antidote , Naloxone administer subcutaneous injection . The trial may stop early treatment arm statistically demonstrate superiority increase harm . Treatment Subjects All patient walk test without fentanyl . They instruct continue current medication previously prescribe make change medication . Should medication dyspnea diuretic , bronchodilator , inhaled steroid , continuous oxygen , opioids etc. , continue . Before first walk test , patient ask rate baseline dyspnea , somnolence , anxiety , pain nausea use ESAS VAS scale . The research team record baseline heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation describe patient 's general appearance . The patient complete 6MWT appropriate supervision research team . The research team re-measure study patient 's heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation describe general appearance comparison baseline . Any adverse effect symptom record . These measure repeat 10 minute 20 minute post-6MWT document resolution symptom post activity . Following 6MWT , treatment dyspnea provide require . The patient also rerate dyspnea , somnolence , anxiety , pain nausea use ESAS VAS scale objective measure . After minimum 1 hour ( wash period ) , proceed second phase test . For second phase , patient ask rate baseline dyspnea , somnolence , anxiety pain nausea use ESAS VAS scale . This ensure consistency among baseline measure . The research team record objective measure state . The patient give fentanyl treatment 6MWT repeat . Patients would administer spray 50mcg fentanyl intranasally suggest first titration step outline Incident Pain Dyspnea protocol , develop Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Palliative Care Program ( http : //palliative.info/IncidentPain.htm ) . Following 6MWT , patient ask rate baseline dyspnea , somnolence , anxiety nausea use ESAS VAS scale . The research team complete record objective measurement . As phase 1 measure repeat 10 minute 20 minute post-6MWT document resolution symptom post activity . Assessment Efficacy By collect data time point describe , able compare average baseline symptom exertion induce symptom . Most importantly , data allow u compare difference subjective symptom pre-exertional treatment intranasal fentanyl symptom without pre-exertional treatment . Using 6MWT , would able objectively assess change study patient 's walking distance , would represent change functional capacity . Assessment Safety Patients monitor subjective symptom assessment scale ( ESAS ) also vital sign monitoring . If adverse event occur , patient monitor research nurse vitals sign take every 5 minute patient settle . If patient settle within 5 minute , evidence improvement vital sign and/or subjective report , research nurse determine whether naloxone administer . If naloxone indicate , patient improve administration naloxone , research nurse report patient 's condition patient primary nurse charge his/her care ward . The research nurse assist primary nurse provide standard medical care participant necessary . If naloxone administer , research nurse inform primary ward nurse continue monitor patient vital sign every 5 min hour . After hour elapse , anticipate study medication clear participant body , unresolved adverse effect manage accord standard medical practice ward doctor nurse . All adverse event document . All serious adverse event ( represent significant health hazard participant ) review medical monitor report sponsor University Manitoba Research Ethics Board Health Canada accordingly . Statistical Analysis Comparison subjective rank data ( non-parametric ) phase 1 phase 2 analyze use Wilcoxin rank sum test . Comparison objective numerical data ( parametric ) phase 1 2 analyzed use paired t-tests . The 6MWT interpretation include absolute difference percentage difference .</detailed_description>
