	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study diet exercise program base Diabetes Prevention Program promote weight loss improve health men low-risk low-intermediate-risk prostate cancer active surveillance . A lifestyle intervention promotes weight loss may influence prostate health . A combined diet exercise program base Diabetes Prevention Program may affect marker ( `` biomarkers '' ) prostate cancer progression . Gathering information may help doctor understand obesity affect prostate cancer progression may help lead program reduce risk prostate cancer progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) lifestyle intervention ( versus [ vs. ] control ) improve serum fast glucose . II . To test whether DPP lifestyle intervention ( vs. control ) improve serum biomarkers glucose regulation ( insulin , C-peptide , insulin-like growth factor-1 [ IGF-1 ] , IGF bind protein 3 [ IGF-BP3 ] adiponectin ) . III . To test whether DPP lifestyle intervention decrease level insulin receptor insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) prostate cancer ( PCa ) tissue epithelium follow-up prostate biopsy . IV . To test whether PCa patient randomize DPP lifestyle intervention sustain lifestyle change least 6 month end intervention period . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether DPP lifestyle intervention improve health-related quality life . II . To evaluate whether DPP lifestyle intervention effect pathologic feature follow-up prostate biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients meet nutritionist 11 time first 6 month receive structure diet exercise instruction . Participants complete exercise session supervise exercise specialist , wear heart rate monitor periodically study . ARM II : Patients receive oral write information base general U.S. dietary physical activity guideline along 20-30 minute individual session dietitian goal 30 minute physical activity 5 day week . After completion study , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
