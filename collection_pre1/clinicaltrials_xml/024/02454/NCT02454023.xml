	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common stroke/TIA , leave untreated , associated recurrent vascular event , poor functional outcome , long-term mortality . Despite high prevalence , OSA often remain underdiagnosed stroke . The purpose study evaluate portable sleep monitor ( PSMs ) broad screen tool OSA stroke/TIA . The study investigator hypothesize screen PSMs lead increase diagnosis treatable OSA stroke/TIA improvement sleep-related functional outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common stroke , leave untreated , associated recurrent vascular event , poor functional outcome , long-term mortality . Despite high prevalence , OSA often remain underdiagnosed stroke . While in-laboratory polysomnography study gold standard diagnosing OSA , use limit lack availability , patient unwillingness sleep overnight laboratory high cost . Home-based PSMs accurately diagnose OSA much accessible , convenient low-priced compare in-laboratory sleep study . The primary purpose study determine whether broad screen OSA use PSMs , compare usual care , increase proportion patient diagnose treatable OSA stroke TIA . Secondary aim include whether screen PSMs increase proportion patient treat OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) whether functional outcome sleep-related outcome improve . Finally , study also determine whether approach cost-effective .</detailed_description>
