	<detailed_description>In study , investigator combine childhood asthma counsel environmental intervention proven effective previous NIH-funded clinical trial , National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study ( NCICAS ) Inner-City Asthma Study ( ICAS ) , third study , Head-off Environmental Asthma Louisiana ( HEAL ) . These study demonstrate participant-tailored intervention reduce asthma morbidity . Through process consensus building , investigator adapt hybrid intervention use primary care clinic locate medically underserved area ( FQHCs ) . Investigators recruit participant age 5-12 year poorly control , moderate-to-severe asthma ensure comparability previous study . Unlike early clinical trial , limited eligibility inner-city child stable housing , CHAMPS enrol participant regardless housing situation ( e.g. , temporary/shared home ) location ( e.g. , urban/rural ) . Investigators collaborate 3 FQHCs Arizona , Michigan , Porto Rico enroll child implement CHAMPS intervention otherwise grant discretion make decision staff , patient flow process determination , track entail . Investigators also invite 3 additional FQHCs recruit enroll child comparison group receive intervention . The primary aim identify understand barrier solution adaptation evidence-based asthma intervention system-level . The evaluation consist determine system make room intervention , identify stakeholder make happen , document process replication , monitoring process outcomes ensure integrity intervention remain intact . The process implementation unique clinical setting present health center describe , include facilitator barrier systematic adoption evidence-based childhood asthma intervention routine practice . Of particular importance determinant related in-home community-based environmental risk , limit understand part parent caretaker , community-wide policy practice may create health risk . The secondary aim ass effectiveness cost-effectiveness evidence-based asthma intervention implement health center . The third final aim develop dissemination strategy tool take intervention .</detailed_description>
