	<brief_summary>Alveolar bone grafting ( ABG ) essential part surgical management cleft lip palate patient . This procedure could obliterate oronasal fistula , stabilize dental arch , offer bone matrix adjacent teeth eruption . Moreover , obliterate oronasal fistula , stop chronic irritation nasal mucosa oral content . Hence , symptom rhinorrhea nasal obstruction could improve . This dental arch defect could predispose dental arch medial collapse . Without alveolar bone graft dental arch stable , dental movement orthodontic treatment limit dental arch expansion possible . Previous operation , patient suffer dental crowding dental inclination toward cleft . This produce difficult dental hygiene predispose dental caries gingivitis . Pre-operative orthodontics treatment advise many center . By aligned teeth previous surgery , good dental hygiene , purpose infection rate reduce success rate well . The Purpose study determine whether pre-operative orthopedic treatment affect secondary alveolar bone graft outcome ass nasal change alveolar bone graft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alveolar Bone Grafting Outcome Between Patient With Without Orthodontic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall goal study : The goal study determine whether pre-operative orthodontic treatment affect secondary alveolar bone graft outcome Importance alveolar bone graft Alveolar bone cleft present majority patient cleave lip palate . This bone cleft destabilize maxillary arch predispose medial collapse . Teeth erupt region alveolar bone defect . Permanent stabilization maxillary segment functional dental arch form achieve reconstruction alveolar bone graft . The goal alveolar bone graft maintain normal occlusion provide matrix continue eruption permanent teeth region . Moreover , future maxillary expansion do unless repair alveolar cleft coordinate desired orthodontic movement . Timing alveolar bone graft Maxillary growth dental age predominant consideration determine time alveolar reconstruction . Maxillary growth complete near age eight year old , whereas maxillary canine erupt age ten.Therefore , minimize growth disturbance maxilla , reconstruction perform growth completed.It widely agree time alveolar graft around stage mixed dentition . The bone grafting complete approximately nine year age bulk alveolar bone growth complete incisor erupt , lateral incisor canine start erupt alveolar cleft region Diagnosis Radiographic study , include panoramic radiograph , select periapical film , Cephalographic film recently CT scan integral part diagnosis evaluation . They provide important assessment pre-operative dentition vicinity cleft , dimension structure cleave well postoperative condition bone bridge alveolar bone grafting.The CT scan offer detail pre-operative post-operative bone structure less distortion . Additionally , CT scan also provide : 1 . Detailed information depth volume bone deposit cleft , 2 . More consistent show bone trabeculation , 3 . Detailed position erupt teeth relative bone graft , 4 . More detailed bone teeth anatomy clinical orthodontics decision . In addition , CT scan could offer 3D lineal measurement volumetric analysis . Arai et al . develop novel cone-bean CT ( CBCT ) Ortho CT important characteristic lower radiation dose ability produce high resolution compare conventional spiral CT. Several report indicate clinical useful 3D image diagnosis maxillofacial region . Pre-operative orthodontic treatment The orthodontist form integral part cleft care . Their recommendation regard timing treatment carefully consider surgical treatment . The dental crowding malposition teeth around cleft interfere oral hygiene . The goal preoperative orthodontic treatment optimize position dentoalveolar structure enable patient well oral hygiene prior operation . Some center recommend orthodontic treatment become part treatment protocol patient However , presurgical orthodontics treatment time consume child require visit clinic monthly orthodontic adjustment . The average duration orthodontic treatment operation 6 month . These factor add discomfort child also create significant financial burden parent . Even primary orthodontic treatment able align upper dental arch ; secondary orthodontic treatment always need complete permanent teeth eruption . Therefore , actual need presurgical orthodontics remain questionable . No study yet actually address outcome alveolar bone graft without presurgical orthodontics . The primary goal present prospective randomize study determine whether pre-operative orthodontics treatment affect secondary alveolar bone graft outcome . Donor site selection : The bone use commonly include iliac crest , calvarial tibia . Regardless donor site , cancellous bone preferable cortical osteochondral graft . The iliac crest donor site preferred sufficient cancellous bone fill even large alveolar bone defect . Surgical procedure : The surgical procedure alveolar bone graft similar procedure describe Hall Posnick et al . except minor modification . With adequate general anesthesia via orotracheal intubation , two team work time one team harvest bone graft team prepare recipient site oral cavity . Attention turn right hip oblique incision make lateral parallel iliac crest . The incision deepen periosteum lateral cortex . The iliac crest reflect medially bone flap . Cancellous bone chip harvest . At time , team work oral cavity . The mouth suction throat pack place . The gingiva upper buccal sulcus infiltrate 1 % Xylocaine 1:200,000 epinephrine solution hemostasis easy dissection . Incisions make along side alveolar cleft . A superiorly base gingival mucoperiosteal flap design raise sharply gingival margin lesser segment . The flap extend posteriorly first molar . The incision curve obliquely towards buccal sulcus . The flap medial segment elevate similar fashion towards midline . The palatal mucoperiosteal flap raise level beyond deep margin alveolar fistula . The fistula margin palatal side freshen suture . The nasal floor tissue could completely separate palatal mucoperiosteum raise palatal flap could strip bony cleft . The nasal floor tissue dissect upward reach pyriform aperture lateral segment cartilaginous septum medial segment . This allow tension-free closure nasal floor tissue adequate correction vertical discrepancy nostril sill . The nasal floor fistula securely repair 4-0 Vicryl suture . Cancellous bone chip already harvest iliac bone another team pack firmly bony defect level alveolar process pyriform aperture cleave side . The periosteum lateral gingival flap score reduce tension especially lateral end incision . The lateral gingival flap advance sutured medial flap palatal flap provide watertight tension free closure .</detailed_description>
