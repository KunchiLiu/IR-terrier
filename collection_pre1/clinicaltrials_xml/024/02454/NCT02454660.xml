	<brief_summary>Uncontrolled hypertension major cause morbidity mortality many patient fail take antihypertensive medication prescribe . The investigator propose use artificial intelligence ( AI ) allow short message service ( SMS text message ) intervention adapt patient ' adherence need substantially improve medication take . The aim study : ( 1 ) develop AI method adaptive decision-making human-centered environment demonstrate feasibility result AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention , ( 2 ) demonstrate intervention `` learn '' adapt SMS message stream accord patient ' medication taking time , ( 3 ) examine potential intervention impact measure improvement medication adherence systolic blood pressure . The investigator recruit 100 patient uncontrolled hypertension antihypertensive medication non-adherence . Adherence covariates measure via survey baseline , 3- 6 month ; blood pressure measure baseline 6 month . Participants give electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor . Participants receive SMS message design motivate antihypertensive medication adherence . Message content frequency adapt automatically use AI algorithm design automatically optimize expect pill bottle opening . For Aim 1 , first 25 patient enrol develop test alternative RL algorithms fine-tune system parameter . For Aim 2 , investigator examine change probability distribution message-types compare distribution patient ' reason non-adherence report baseline . For Aim 3 , investigator examine change self-reported medication non-adherence blood pressure automatically-reported pill bottle opening . This pilot study establish feasibility potential impact novel approach mobile health message self-management support . The result use support R01 application large definitive trial intervention impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Self-management chronic condition involve complex behavior , patient vary adherence behavior . The focus proposal medication adherence patient ' failure take medication prescribed major cause excess morbidity mortality increase health care cost . Studies suggest 33-50 % patient take medication properly , contribute nearly 100,000 premature death year $ 290 billion health care cost . Adherence antihypertensive medication particular importance right , hypertension serve important tracer condition well understand improve medication adherence generally . Uncontrolled hypertension major cause stroke , coronary heart disease , heart failure mortality , medication non-adherence major cause uncontrolled hypertension . For example , one-year study ~5,000 hypertensive patient , patient take medication intermittently half patient eventually discontinue medication medical advise . Improving medication adherence require address multiple challenge patient typically variety reason take medication prescribe , beliefs disease treatment , organizational challenge , cost barrier . Moreover , patient ' regimen , health status , social context change time , adherence support intervention need adapt , service lack flexibility . Mobile health ( mHealth ) service patient text message SMS show promise improve medication adherence . However , since almost mHealth service base simplistic , deterministic protocol , intervention lack capacity meet patient ' complex change need . As consequence , rudimentary system demonstrate modest effect tend decrease time . The investigator propose apply artificial intelligence ( AI ) method , specifically Reinforcement Learning ( one type AI ) , develop model medication adherence system automatically adapt SMS communication improve individual medication take . The propose project result new multidisciplinary collaboration UM expert College Pharmacy , College Engineering , School Medicine . Our long-term goal improve health outcome use artificial intelligence ( AI ) enhance mobile health tool . The objective propose pilot study develop Reinforcement Learning-based mHealth program focus medication adherence among patient poorly control hypertension . Our central hypothesis SMS system use Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) : acceptable patient , adapt hypertension patient ' unique adherence-related need preference change need time , improve medication adherence blood pressure control . The specific aim : 1 . Develop RL method adaptive decision-making human-centered environment demonstrate feasibility result RL-based adaptive SMS medication adherence intervention , 2 . Demonstrate `` learn '' RL-base adaptive system use data show adaptation SMS message stream accord variation across patient time reason non-adherence , 3 . Examine potential efficacy RL-based adaptive SMS intervention respect improvement medication adherence systolic blood pressure . The result pilot project include novel AI/RL technology evidence regard real-world use base experience sample adult poorly control hypertension . These result use support R01 application large definitive study intervention 's impact patient ' health long-term adherence behavior . Over long term , AI-enhanced mHealth self-management support infrastructure unprecedented collaboration investigator Pharmacy , Medicine , Computer Science lay foundation large program NIH-funded research use similar AI approach address behavior change challenge large number health healthcare problem .</detailed_description>
