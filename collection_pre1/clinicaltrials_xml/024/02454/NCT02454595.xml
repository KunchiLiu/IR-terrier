	<brief_title>Registry Measure Impact Adding Genomic Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective open registry measure impact first-line therapy genomic test biopsy tissue recently diagnose treatment-na誰ve patient early stage localize prostate cancer . Physicians , use standard clinical-pathological parameter ( PSA , Gleason score , clinical stage percent positive core ) , complete questionnaire record recommendation first-line therapy among various treatment option . A sample biopsy tissue test use Prolaris速 genomic test relative cancer aggressiveness score share physician . After review consider result genomic test prior patient consult , physician complete second treatment decision questionnaire VAS . The physician discus recommend treatment plan patient record agree treatment plan third questionnaire . After initial treatment initiate , physician research staff record actual treatment administer fourth questionnaire ( preferably record within 3 month patient consultation ) .</detailed_description>
