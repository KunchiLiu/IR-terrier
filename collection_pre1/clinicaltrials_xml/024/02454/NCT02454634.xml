	<brief_summary>The NOA-16 trial first-in-man trial IDH1 ( isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 ) peptide vaccine target IDH1R132H mutation ( amino acid exchange arginine glutamine position 132 IDH1 ) . The aim trial evaluate safety tolerability immune response IDH1 peptide vaccine patient IDH1R132H-mutated , WHO grade III-IV glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial IDH1 Peptide Vaccine IDH1R132H-mutated Grade III-IV Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population molecularly define include IDH1R132H mutant grade III IV glioma without co-deletion 1p/19q loss alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked ( ATRX ) expression . Within trial , IDH1 peptide vaccine administer 39 patient . In treatment group 1 vaccination treatment do alone start 4-6 week post radiotherapy . In treatment group 2 3 vaccination treatment do parallel temozolomide ( TMZ ) chemotherapy start day 10 4th TMZ cycle ( treatment group 2 ) day 10 1st TMZ cycle post concomitant radiochemotherapy ( treatment group 3 ) .</detailed_description>
