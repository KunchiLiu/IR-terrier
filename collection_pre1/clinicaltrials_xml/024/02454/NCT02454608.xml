	<brief_summary>Verapamil L-type calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) show reduce inflammation variety tissue . Verapamil also show improve eosinophilic inflammation animal model asthma also function P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitor . A major subtype chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) characterize eosinophilic inflammation well P-gp overexpression . The goal study therefore see whether Verapamil may use treat CRS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) impact 30 million Americans result $ 6.9 $ 9.9 billion annual healthcare expenditures $ 12.8 billion productivity cost . The prevalence Chronic Rhinosinusitis Nasal Polyps ( CRSwNP ) Europe estimate 2-4.3 % think similar United States . Corticosteroids remain mainstay treatment although novel therapy develop base evolve understanding inflammatory pathway involve disease pathogenesis . CRSwNP characterize presence edematous polypoid mucosa predominantly eosinophilic inflammation . Recent evidence focus sinonasal epithelial cell primary driver local dysregulated immune response secretion type 2 helper T-cell ( Th2 ) promote cytokine . While study suggest epithelial cell capable orchestrate local immune response , mechanism responsible regulate cytokine secretion poorly understood may influence efflux function epithelial P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) . P-gp 170 kiloDalton membrane protein belong sub-family B adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter superfamily . P-gp utilizes ATP hydrolysis transport wide range substrate across plasma membrane . P-gp mediate transport observe regulation cytokine secretion human T-cells well sinonasal epithelial cell implicate potential immunomodulatory role . Studies group demonstrate P-gp overexpressed mucosa patient Th2 skew CRS endotypes include CRSwNP capable regulate secretion Th2 polarizing cytokine . Together , finding suggest P-gp participates non-canonical regulation cytokine secretion within CRSwNP may thereby represent druggable target . Verapamil Hydrochloride ( HCl ) one first inhibitor P-gp identify 1982 also function calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) . Verapamil since categorize first generation P-gp inhibitor potent selective 2nd 3rd generation molecule subsequently develop use chemotherapy sensitizer . Several study , include group , report Verapamil capable modulate inflammatory response human T-cells , animal model asthma , nasal polyp . Using organotypic explant model , previously show Verapamil similar effect dexamethasone ability abrogate Interleukin ( IL ) -5 , IL-6 , Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin secretion . While Verapamil cardioactive , consider first-line prophylactic drug cluster headache usually well tolerated otherwise healthy patient . In light prior study demonstrate immunomodulatory role P-gp promote Th2 skew cytokine secretion CRSwNP , hypothesize low dose Verapamil HCl monotherapy would safe effective treatment CRSwNP .</detailed_description>
