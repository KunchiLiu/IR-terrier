	<brief_title>Vortioxetine Patients With Major Depressive Disorder Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comorbid Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) common : Major depressive disorder highly prevalent disorder serious , case life-threatening , condition . The 12-month prevalence major depressive disorder United States 6.6 % ( Kessler et al. , 2003 ) . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) also large grow problem United States . According 2014 American Heart Association ( AHA ) report heart disease stroke statistic , estimate 15.4 million Americans ≥20 year age coronary artery disease . The total prevalence coronary artery disease population estimate 6.4 % , prevalence 7.9 % men 5.1 % woman . By year 2030 , prevalence coronary artery disease project increase approximately 18 % 2013 estimate ( Go et al. , 2014 ) . Thus , patient major depressive disorder comorbid CAD represent large population patient . Depression patient CAD clinically important : Depression frequently accompany coronary artery disease link somatic symptom , hospitalization , increase financial burden , poor quality life , well predictor bad outcome cardiac disease . Reduction cardiac risk factor less likely successful depressed patient . Depression may also interfere medication adherence , depress patient three time likely noncompliant medication regimen . In addition , depression associate decreased rate participation cardiac rehabilitation , high healthcare utilization cost , greatly reduce quality life ( Lichtman et al. , 2009 ) . Due effect depression coronary artery disease , increase recognition depression formally consider risk factor adverse medical outcome patient acute coronary syndrome ( Lichtman et al. , 2014 ) . Thus , great , unmet clinical need treat patient major depressive disorder coronary artery disease . In addition old tricyclic antidepressant , new serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor also associate cardiovascular risk like hypertension , orthostatic hypotension , perhaps QTc prolongation ( Mago et al. , 2014 ) . Vortioxetine newly approve antidepressant thought work combine modulation 5-HT receptor subtypes inhibition serotonin transporter ( Citrome , 2014 ) . Early data suggest multimodal mechanism action result increase brain level serotonin , dopamine , noradrenaline prefrontal cortex ( Pehrson et al. , 2013 ) . Clinical trial vortioxetine major depressive disorder show cardiovascular adverse effect ( Mago et al. , 2014 ) . Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) Heart Rate Variability measure base change interval consecutive heart beat consecutive instantaneous heart rate . It become conventionally accepted term describe variation instantaneous heart rate RR interval . Long term reduce heart rate variability lead immune dysfunction inflammation , cardiovascular disease mortality ( Newhouse , 2014 ) . Several study depressive patient show reduced heart rate variability suggest increase sympathetic activity and/or reduce vagal activity ( Carney et al. , 2009 ) . Thus , treat depression effectively may reduce heart rate variability , surrogate marker well cardiovascular outcome . The propose study plan pilot , open-label study use , first time , vortioxetine patient document coronary disease . Therefore , sample size base formal sample size calculation feasibility small study , positive , lead future large , adequately power study . A sample size 25 patient appropriate present purpose . The result propose study would inform sample size calculation future , large study .</detailed_description>
