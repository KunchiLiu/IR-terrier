	<brief_summary>This study randomise controlled clinical trial design evaluate effectiveness two different exercise base treatment management patient knee problem related degenerative ( wear tear ) change . Recent evidence suggest put weight joint ( joint loading ) may beneficial . The Investigators know physiotherapy exercise important treating patient , investigator know exercise work best . In study investigator compare current physiotherapy care new programme exercise gradually increase amount joint loading . The study recruit approximately 140 patient Leeds Musculoskeletal ( MSK ) service , age 45 refer physiotherapy GP activity relate knee pain.Patients suitable happy take part select randomly ( choose patient physiotherapist ) receive either normal physiotherapy treatment , knee load exercise . The treatment phase last six week participant ask carry exercise twice daily time . At end period , patient ask tocomplete questionnaire six month investigator assess patient . The main aim evaluate clinical effectiveness progressive joint load protocol . However , data collect also use see way identify advance might respond good either treatment . The investigator also collect information relate cost effectiveness deliver different treatment . The final aim study test easy collect detail data area relate study carry future .</brief_summary>

Predictor variables substantial single variable association outcome ( p &lt; 0.2 ) include multivariable linear regression model determine adjust association improve outcome treatment arm . A second model use multi-levels ( two level : 1. time point individual , 2. individual ) determine whether trajectory change outcome score differs two arm study . Significant predictor improve outcome determine model . A sensitivity analysis undertaken final model base degree compliance home treatment use category determine exploratory analysis data .</detailed_description>
