	<brief_summary>Study design determine ability accuracy anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( AS-OCT ) measure distance corneoscleral limbus insertion site extraocular muscle ( EOM ) adult without previous strabismus surgery . And compare surgical patient pre-operative AS-OCT limbal-muscle insertion distance measurement intraoperative limbal-muscle insertion measurement use caliper ( gold standard ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Distance Between Limbus Insertion Extraocular Muscles Using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment strabismus often surgical . A good surgical plan would possible exact limbus-insertion distance extraocular muscle know . The clinical ophthalmologic examination , slit lamp biomicroscopy , elucidate muscle insertion position prior surgery . This information especially important patient undergone prior strabismus surgery . In patient , previous surgical data may available muscle insertion may different location expect . Thus , preoperative imaging study could accurately locate muscle insertion may useful design surgical plan , possibly improve success surgery , reduce operative time intraoperative complication . Previous study use compute tomography ( CT ) scan high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , fail reliably detect rectus muscle insertion . Ocular ultrasound allow anatomic visualization EOM , low image resolution . Ultrasound biomicroscopy ( UBM ) , accurately measure limbus-insertion distance , however , induces significant measurement error due pressure apply globe examination . The recent advance AS-OCT image allow non-invasive , detailed , cross-sectional examination anterior segment structure generate two-dimensional high resolution image reflect light beam . Two previous study successfully use AS-OCT analyze EOM insertion , number participant small patient previous strabismus muscle surgery include . The investigator purpose gather limbus-EOM insertion distance data use AS-OCT great number patient , include patient undergone previous strabismus procedure , correlate AS-OCT measurement intraoperative finding patient undergo strabismus surgery . Procedures 1 . After recruitment , write consent obtain subject agree participate . 2 . A review medical record perform obtain demographic data , type strabismus , history previous eye surgery , etc ( see Data Collection Sheet ) 3 . AS-OCT imaging rectus muscle perform patient use Visante ( Visante AS-OCT ; Carl Zeiss Meditec ) and/or Heidelberg Spectralis ( Spectralis AS-OCT ; Heidelberg Engineering ) instrument . 4 . For patient undergo strabismus surgery , distance corneoscleral limbus insertion site rectus muscle measure caliper time surgery . 5 . After surgery , AS-OCT image rectus muscle perform routinely schedule post-operative clinic visit . All acquire image store Bascom Palmer Eye Institute MERGE HealthCare Completes Acquisition Ophthalmic Imaging Systems ( OIS ) , clinical imaging storage system , secure unauthorized access . All background information enter REDCAP data capture system one investigator accessible investigator ( http : //www.project-redcap.org/ ) . The AS-OCT device use commercially available , FDA approve , routinely use clinical setting evaluate anterior posterior segment eye . There experimental imaging procedure plan purpose study . All imaging acquisition protocol well-established non-invasive . There contact eye image acquisition . This expose subject great minimal risk result participate study . All eligible adult patient undergo strabismus evaluation Bascom Palmer Eye Institute invite participate . The consent process occur clinic visit . The study involve additional clinic visit . The patient ample opportunity discus study , review consent form , sign consent form course visit . This study follow SOP : Informed Consent Process Research ( HRP-090 ) . Non-English Speaking Subjects We exclude patient whose English proficiency precludes read form understanding content .</detailed_description>
