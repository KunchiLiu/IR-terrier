	<brief_title>Hyperglycemic Profiles Obstructive Sleep Apnea : Effects PAP Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research last decade show obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common condition people diabetes . Observational experimental evidence also indicate intermittent hypoxemia recurrent arousal OSA may alter glucose metabolism worsen glycemic control . However , impact treat OSA positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy glycemic variability control well define . Adequately powered randomized clinical trial yet perform demonstrate whether PAP therapy OSA diabetic improve glycemic variability ( control ) , decrease blood pressure , reverse endothelial dysfunction . The overarch goal study determine whether PAP therapy OSA diabetic lead improvement ( ) glycemic variability assess self-monitoring blood glucose continuous monitoring glucose ; ( b ) glycosylated hemoglobin ; ( c ) blood pressure ; ( ) endothelial function ; ( e ) serum urinary biomarkers ; ( f ) dyslipidemia .</detailed_description>
