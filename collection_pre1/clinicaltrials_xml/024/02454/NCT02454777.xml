	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study feasibility high-intensity interval training improve cardiovascular fitness patient stage I-III breast cancer undergo chemotherapy trastuzumab . Trastuzumab help patient live long , may cause side effect heart . Aerobic exercise may help heart function well , may help protect side effect trastuzumab . Exercise may also help reduce fatigue prevent cancer come back . High-intensity interval training involve short burst high intensity effort longer period recovery . This may also allow patient exercise long period time still physically active . This trial study whether patient tolerate high-intensity interval training , well work improve fitness patient breast cancer receive trastuzumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Intensity Interval Training Improving Fitness Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy With Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility ( completion &gt; 80 % exercise session ) utilize high-intensity interval training ( HIT ) . II . To determine effect HIT aerobic exercise adaptation compare moderate-intensity , continuous training ( MCT ) control ( CON ) . III . To examine effect HIT leave ventricular function compare MCT CON group . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 3 group . ARM I : Participants undergo HIT 30 minute , thrice weekly 12 week . ARM II : Participants undergo MCT 30 minute , thrice weekly 12 week . ARM III : Participants maintain current sedentary activity level ( &lt; 60 minute total exercise per week ) 12 week . Participants document weekly activity exercise log . Following completion study visit , participant give option complete MCT exercise program Arm II . After completion study , patient follow week 13 25 .</detailed_description>
