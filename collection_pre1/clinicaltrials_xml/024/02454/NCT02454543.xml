	<detailed_description>More recent data show perform local therapy lymphogenic metastatic prostate cancer result definite benefit carcinomaspecific overall survival . The analysis data lead change paradigm treatment lymphogenic metastatic prostate cancer ( Isbarn Deutsches Ärzteblatt 2013 ) . Patients low lymphogenic metastatic load low comorbidity therefore frequently give local therapy . In retrospective review patient lympho-genic metastatic prostate cancer , either treat mean systemic standard therapy standard therapy plus radical prostatectomy , highly significant benefit show patient group operate ( Engel et al. , Eur Urol 2012 ) . The 5 10 year overall survival rate cohort 84 % 64 % respectively follow performance RP standard therapy without RP 60 % 28 % respectively . Our work group able confirm clear survival benefit lymphogenic metastatic stage patient operate : match pair analysis clinically progression-free survival rate 5 10 year 77 % 61 % respectively additional RP 61 % 31 % respectively standard therapy alone ( p=0.005 ) . The trend find cancer-specific survival ( 84 % 76 % additional RP versus 81 % 46 % standard therapy alone ( p=0.001 ) ( Steuber et al. , BJUI 2011 ) . The impressive improvement survival rate lymphogenic metastatic prostate cancer local therapy compare systemic drug therapy alone suggest patient distant metastasis could potentially also benefit local therapy . Besides possible effect tumour control , RP could also beneficial regard local progression prostate cancer ( rectal infiltration , infiltration bladder ) . This could lead improvement quality life course disease . On hand , radical prostatectomy associate potential side-effects ( e.g . urinary incontinence approximately 5 - 10 % patient well usual possible side-effects , thrombosis , embolism , disturbance wind heal etc . ) , lead loss term quality life .</detailed_description>
