	<detailed_description>Follitropin alfa human follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) preparation recombinant DNA origin , consist two non-covalently link , nonidentical glycoprotein designate alfa- beta-subunits . Similar glycoprotein hormone , FSH high degree heterogeneity due difference amount and/or composition carbohydrate residue , particularly sialic acid . FSH , active component r-hFSH important hormone responsible follicular recruitment development . In order obtain final maturation follicle ovulation absence endogenous LH surge , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) must give follow administration r-hFSH monitoring patient indicate sufficient follicular development occur . Secondary endpoint measure study Efficacy - Total dose r-hFSH require , - Number day r-hFSH stimulation - Percentage patient need increase low dose r-hFSH , - Number treatment cycle cancellation reason - Fertilization rate - Number fertilize oocytes - Number good quality embryo - Number embryo transfer - Implantation Rate - Biochemical pregnancy - Clinical pregnancy 10 week post embryo transfer - Pregnancy outcome Safety Incidence - OHSS ( severity ) - Local reaction ( pain , bruising , redness , itching , swell ) - Systemic drug adverse event Tolerability - Frequency patient withdraw study drug due lack tolerance - Frequency patient withdraw study drug treatment due reason - Patient Reported Pain : measure Patients Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) Immunogenicity Measurement possible antibody exogenous r-hFSH evaluate . Pharmacodynamics - Number size distribution follicle treatment - Number size distribution follicle day ovulation induction ( uHCG ) - Number follicles &gt; 14 mm day hCG injection . - Hormone parameter : serum level estradiol , luteinizing hormone progesterone day hCG injection - Metaphase II oocytes ; - Number good quality oocyte</detailed_description>
