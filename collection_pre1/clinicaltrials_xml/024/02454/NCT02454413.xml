	<detailed_description>Aim study The presence biofilm - i.e . structure microbial community attach surface encase exopolymer matrix - acrylic removable denture associate serious systemic condition , especially dependent elderly [ 1 ] . Oral bacteria implicate bacterial endocarditis [ 2 ] , aspiration pneumonia [ 3 , 4 ] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 5 , 6 ] , amongst disease [ 1 , 7 ] . Ample evidence provide regard relationship proper oral hygiene overall systemic health . Plaque dentures complex aggregate contain 108 organism per milligram , involve 600 prokaryote specie [ 8 ] . The different specie collaborate form symbiotic biofilm . The biofilms dentate patient study extensively , study biofilm microbiota complete acrylic denture [ 10-18 ] . It appear distinct biofilms , associate pathogenic risk , present 'healthy ' versus denture stomatitis affect participant [ 15 , 16 , 18 ] . Not poor denture cleaning also inappropriate habit , wear denture overnight prove associated prevalence Candida-associated stomatitis [ 19 , 20 ] . Therefore , overnight removal acrylic removable denture advise clinical setting . Although evidence-based guideline denture care maintenance available [ 21 ] , guideline nocturnal storage condition dentures miss . The investigator therefore perform study ( submit publication ) evaluate effect different overnight storage protocol denture biofilm formation maturation . The result study show use cleanse tablet ( Corega Tabs Anti-bacteria® , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare SA , Genval , Belgium ) acrylic removable denture overnight storage reduces denture biofilm mass pathogenicity compare dry water preservation . As mechanical denture cleaning perform aforementioned study , aim propose study evaluate combine effect mechanical cleaning overnight storage condition microbial composition Candida albicans colonization denture biofilm formation . This information require develop clinical guideline acrylic denture clean overnight storage aim reduce risk pose pathogenic microorganism , particularly bedridden immunocompromised patient . Research question •What effect mechanical cleaning biofilm formation removable acrylic denture ? - Is ultrasonic clean efficient compare denture brush respect prevention biofilm formation removable acrylic denture ? - What effect overnight storage water cleanse tablet biofilm formation mechanically clean removable acrylic denture ? Materials &amp; Methods - Participants -number : 30 -Inclusion criterion : Institutionalised frail elder Fully edentulous low upper jaw Removable denture wearer low upper jaw Good oral health -Exclusion criterion : Current history corticosteroid treatment within 3 month prior study Current history antimicrobial treatment within 3 month prior study Inability provide inform consent Inability comply study requirement - Test condition Denture clean method Denture overnight storage condition 1Brushing water soap Immersion water cleanse tablet 2Brushing water soap Immersion water without cleanse tablet ( = neg control ) 3Ultrasonic clean Immersion water cleanse tablet 4Ultrasonic cleaning Immersion water without cleanse tablet - This study approve Institutional Ethics Committee ( S54968 , University Hospitals Leuven , Belgium ) register Belgian Clinical Trials database ( Identifier : B322201316863 ) . - Study design -Cross-over study randomize sequence 4 test condition This imply 4 test condition execute within 30 study participant . - The sequence test condition individual participant randomize . - Double blind ( participant well investigator know test condition ) - All test condition apply 5 day . This mean patient undergo 4 test period 5 day . - Each test period precede wash-out period 2 day standard care apply . This standard care denture clean brushing water soap overnight storage water . - All denture decalcify use vinegar prior start study . - At start study , dentures mechanically cleaned mean denture brush additional ultrasonic cleaning . After mechanical cleaning , denture also desinfected use 1 % chlorhexidine digluconate gel ( Corsodyl gel , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare SA , Genval , Belgium ) . - After mechanical denture clean desinfection start test period , control sample ( n=4 ) take evaluate effectiveness clean desinfection procedure . - After test period , test sample ( n=4 ) take - The participant ask clean denture . 2 care taker involve study denture clean apply appropriate overnight storage condition . - Outcome measure : Clinical health denture bear mucosa Method : clinical evaluation Microbial analyse Method : qualitative quantitative PCR analyse 20 select oral bacteria ( Aa , Pg , Tf , Td , Pi , Fn , Pm , Pn , Cg , Cr , En , Ec , Cs , Cc , Sm , Sg , Sc , Ao , Av , Vp ) Candida Albicans . Biofilm sample perform 5-mm diameter circular region interest , situate bucco-distally low second premolar ( Figure 1 ) . In order standardize position dimension region ensure optimal reproducibility microbial sampling , custom-made mold low prosthesis placeholder ring make ( Optosil® , Heraeus Kulzer GmbH , Hanau , Germany ) ( Figure 1 ) . The placeholder ring place way transition artificial teeth gum situate centrally . These mold fabricate follow denture disinfection start study , re-used throughout study absence dimensional change time preserve properly ( i.e . dry plastic bag ) . The mold ring desinfected microbial sampling . Denture plaque score Method : Denture plaque score independently 2 investigator use 4 % erythrosine disclose solution accord Augsburger Elahi [ 22 ] ( score range 0-4 ) •Study protocol Time point Action Microbial sample Day 0 ( morning ) calculus removal use vinegar mechanical denture clean ° Day 0-2 standard carei Day 3 ( morning ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii control sample 1* Day 3-7 test period 1 Day 7 ( even ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii test sample 1** Day 8-9 standard carei ( wash-out period ) Day 10 ( morning ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii control sample 2* Day 10-14 test period 2 Day 14 ( even ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii test sample 2** Day 15-16 standard carei ( wash-out period ) Day 17 ( morning ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii control 3* Day 17-21 test period 3 Day 21 ( even ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii test sample 3** Day 22-23 standard carei ( wash-out period ) Day 24 ( morning ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii control 4* Day 24-28 test period 4 Day 28 ( even ) Mechanical denture cleaning° desinfectionii END OF THE STUDY test sample 4** °mechanical denture cleaning : brushing water soap + additional ultrasonic clean standard care : denture brush water soap overnight storage tab water iidesinfection 1 % chlorhexidine digluconate gel ( Corsodyl gel , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare SA , Genval , Belgium ) *control sampling : mechanical cleaning desinfection **test sampling : mechanical cleaning desinfection</detailed_description>
