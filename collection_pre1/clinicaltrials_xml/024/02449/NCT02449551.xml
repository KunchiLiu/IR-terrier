	<brief_summary>Volitinib potent selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor . Volitinib find inhibit c-Met kinase enzyme cell level IC50s 4 nM enzyme Met phosphorylation cell . Consistent potent enzyme cell activity , volitinib find inhibit cell growth vitro tumor c-Met gene amplification absence HGF stimulation IC50s generally 10 nM . It also potently inhibit HGF-stimulated cell proliferation tumor c-Met overexpression carry HGF/c-Met autocrine loop . This study single-arm , phase II study votilinib patient advance gastric adenocarcinoma harbor MET amplification third line treatment Volitinib 800 mg administer orally day 21 day one cycle . To investigate efficacy volitinib patient advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harbor MET amplification .</brief_summary>
