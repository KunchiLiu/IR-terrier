	<brief_title>Efficacy Consolidative Involved-site Radiotherapy Patients With Limited-stage Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular lymphoma ( FL ) second common histology non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma significantly increase incidence past three decade . FL , grade 1 2 recognize indolent natural history good long-term survival rate despite high risk recurrence . Approximately 25 % patient present stage I II disease ( limited stage FL ) diagnosis , 10-year overall survival ( OS ) rate range 52 % 79 % . The treatment option include radiotherapy ( RT ) alone , immunotherapy ± chemotherapy , immunotherapy ± chemotherapy + RT , even observation select patient . There differences OS . RT important option patient limited stage FL . Despite evidence international guideline ' recommendation primary RT consider preferred treatment approach , RT alone remain worrisomely use treatment limited stage FL . The positive result immediate RT associate improved disease-specific overall survival ( OS ) patient stage I II follicular lymphoma show SEER data . The OS disease-free survival ( DFS ) 15 year limited stage FL treat RT range 40 % 66 % 40 % 49 % , respectively . However , controversy consider literature describe outcome early-stage follicular lymphoma treat RT alone largely consist retrospective account select patient single institution treat era modern chemotherapy staging procedure . For patient underwent rigorous stag stage I FL , result The National LymphoCare Study show progression-free survival ( PFS ) significantly improve either R-chemotherapy systemic therapy + RT compare patient receive RT alone . The OS difference among diverse treatment approach patient . This result also approve several recent data prospective study retrospective analysis . So , question whether RT alone , historical standard , still best choice patient limited stage FL . On combined-modality therapy ( CMT ) limit stage FL , combine consolidation RT brief modern CHOP CHOP-like chemotherapy improve result DFS though OS fail improvement . At time , definitive radiation-dose study indolent lymphoma British National Lymphoma Investigation show 5-year freedom local progression OS difference either radiation dose 24 Gy dose 40 45 Gy , respectively . Therefore , recommend approach patient limited stage FL National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) 24Gy~30Gy consolidation RT follow effective systemic therapy . The main controversy focus time RT , combination chemotherapy RT ongoing reduction radiation field size . FL generally consider incurable disease long-term outcome PFS OS . Long-term complication relate RT among patient early-stage FL focus emphasize Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) . In British study 2,456 patient NHL , relative risk ( RR ) malignancies 1.3 per 10,000 person-years . The common late non-neoplastic event cardiac disease infertility . In study conduct European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) , late non-neoplastic event observe 46 % 757 patient median follow-up 9.4 year NHL treatment . There universal consensus `` standard '' RT field size treatment limited stage FL . The primary objective reduce RT field size low rate radiation-induced toxicity radiation-induced second malignancy long-term survivor without compromise disease control . Some previous study show involved-field RT ( IFRT ) , involved regional RT ( IRRT ) , extended-field RT ( EFRT ) similar survival outcome . Even radiotherapy field size involved node RT ( INRT ) . The retrospective result Campbell et al show PFS significant difference patient receive IRRT compare patient receive INRT . Compared IRRT group , small RT field size INRT group result increase risk distant failure without infield regional recurrence ( 38 % vs 32 % , respectively ) . However , OS inferior INRT group 10 year ( 71 % vs 59 % ) . The underlying reason may relate absence effective systemic therapy . Moreover , definition CTV RT research Campbell et al . The planning target volume ( PTV ) INRT research also add physiologic movement interfraction setup variation gross target volume ( GTV ) encompass site know disease . It necessary design prospective study effective systemic therapy certain target volume evaluate efficacy adverse event RT small RT field size . Involved-site radiotherapy ( ISRT ) , base modify involved field , aim reduce radiation volume treat probability late effect . Its radiation target include gross tumor volume ( GTV ) , clinical target volume ( CTV ) , plan target volume ( PTV ) , define International Commission Radiation Units Measurements Report ( ICRU ) 50 . This base defining site gross disease chemotherapy , GTV use CT-based volume expansion form CTV cranio-caudal direction . Compared IFRT , response rate toxicity relate involved-site radiotherapy ( ISRT ) evaluate CR PR patient limited-stage FL effective systemic treatment . The CTV ISRT define region include prechemotherapy volume disease 1.5 cm margin expand cranio-caudally direction potential lymphatic spread . The CTV extend air transverse plane limit involved lymph node region define Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) . The PTV extend CTV add necessary margin setup error organ motion .</detailed_description>
