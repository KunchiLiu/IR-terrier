	<detailed_description>Since obesity become major public health concern appropriate strategy need order reduce obesity-related health risk later life span . Obesity one main risk factor diabetes cardiovascular disease , also several type cancer . Several key mechanism , may link obesity , metabolic dysregulation cancer risk , obesity-driven inflammation , alter adipokine , growth factor sex hormone signaling , change microbiota identify . Various study show continuous calorie restriction ( CCR ) exercise effective strategy enforce weight-loss improve biomarker profile . Intermittent calorie restriction ( ICR ) novel strategy might induce favorable metabolic change lead high compliance rate . The concept diet regime simple e.g . 2 days/week fast follow standardized diet cover 25 % energy need 5 days/week ad libitum consumption . To verify effectiveness ICR alternative weight loss strategy CCR control intervention trial require . Although CCR ICR induce negative energy balance , metabolic effect human physiology might differ . Within HELENA-study 50 non-smoking adult ( men woman age 35 65 year ) BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² ≤ 40 kg/m² randomly assign intervention arm : ( 1 ) ICR arm ( 2 day/week fasting , i.e . 25 % energy intake , energy intake 100 % 5 days/week lead weekly average energy intake ~80 % ) ( 2 ) CCR arm ( daily energy intake 80 % ) 3 ) control arm ( general advice healthy nutrition ) . The trial last 1 year , intervention phase 12 week ( week 0-12 ; intervention ; close contact participant ) , follow maintenance phase ( week 13-24 ; maintenance ; regular , less frequent contact participant ) follow-up phase ( week 25-52 ) . Biological specimen collect follow : Baseline ( T0 , week 1 ) : Blood , urine , stool subcutaneous adipose tissue sample ; After 3 month ( T1 , week 13 ) : Blood , urine , stool subcutaneous adipose tissue sample ; After 6 month ( T2 , week 25 ) : Blood , urine , stool ; After 12 month ( T3 , week 52 ) : Blood urine ; Magnet resonance tomography imaging ( MRI , T0 , T1 T3 ) lifestyle assessment ( nutrition behavior , physical activity quality life , T0-T3 ) perform unravel link fat distribution , metabolic change , health lifestyle . The primary objective three-arm randomize control intervention trial investigate effect nutrition intervention body weight gene expression profile subcutaneous adipose tissue overweight obese individual . We hypothesize good compliance rate achieve ICR rather CCR group ICR show high sustainability respect weight loss , weight maintenance , biomarker profile . The purpose study analyze nutrition intervention associate weight loss different effect abdominal fat distribution liver fat content . The statistical analysis carry use SAS statistical software [ SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ] comparable software . Descriptive statistic , correlation univariate analysis use get insight general characteristic participant intervention group . For primary objective , two side t-test ANCOVA modelling perform investigate whether change gene expression level affect nutrition intervention . Comparisons two group ( e.g . ICR CCR CCR/ICR control group ) carry use t-tests parallel comparison across three group carry use ANCOVA model . Where applicable , analysis include adjustment confounders , specially age gender . Likewise , stratify analysis carry necessary . ANCOVA model perform evaluate effect nutrition intervention biomarker profile , adjust stratum age gender . Similar evaluation perform fat distribution pattern , quality life , physical activity nutrition pattern . In addition , correlation linear regression analysis perform measure effect weight-loss , gene expression level metabolic profile , control nutrition intervention group .</detailed_description>
