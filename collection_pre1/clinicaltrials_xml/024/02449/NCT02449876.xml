	<brief_title>The Feasibility Using Neuroscience Education Adults Over 65 Years Old With Chronic Low Back and/or Lower Extremity Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Health care professional commonly provide education patient pain . Traditionally , education focus pathoantaomical aspect patient 's condition . ( 1,2 ) Despite popularity type education evidence indicate either little effect ( 2-4 ) case negative effect pain disability . ( 3,5-7 ) In contrast , therapeutic neuroscience education ( TNE ) directly address cognition pain teach patient basic pain physiology address abnormal pain belief ( e.g. , pain=harm ) . TNE show produce positive change pain belief , include reduction pain catastrophizing , improvement pain level pain-related disability . ( 2,3,8 ) To date , research impact TNE focus working-aged adult . Pain however , highly prevalent among old adult population , lead activity limitation pain-related disability . ( 4-7 ) The purpose project determine whether old adult receptive toTNE , TNE impact gait speed old adult TNE impact pain belief . Methods : This single group , uncontoled pilot study 15-20 adult age 65 year old report low back low extremity pain . Subjects recurited physician office community via flyer word mouth . Subjects screen eligibility inform consent obtain . Inclusion criterion include age 65 , self-reported back and/or lower extermity pain present day least three month , independent ambulation ( without assistive device ) English speaking . Exclusion criterion include cancer-related pain , recent ( within 6 month ) surgery back low extremity affect mobility , current ongoing treatment another healthcare professional low back low extremity pain ( include physical therapy , chiropractic massage ) diagnose impact mobility rusult cognitive limitation . Upon enrollment study subject complete intake questionnaire ( basic demographic information , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK ) , Pain Disability Index ( PDI ) , Resilience Scale ( RS ) , one physical performance measure ( Gait Speed , prefer maximal ) . The educational material deliver two , one one , meeting total time approximately ninety minute . The first meeting last one hour educational content deliver session . A supplemental handout ( reference ) , highlight concept cover presentation , give subject . The second educational session serve review material cover first meeting describe supplemental material . During session subject encourage ask question get clarification cover topic unclear . At conclusion second session survey initially administer repeat ( TKS , PDI , RS ) , gait speed test repeat brief survey education administer . 1 . Butler D , Moseley L , eds . Explain pain .
