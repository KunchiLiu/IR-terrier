Papilla preservation technique minimally invasive surgical technique seek group , avoid score periosteum . Flaps reposition suture use single modify internal mattress suture ( 5-0 Monosyn , Braun ) defect-associated interdental area similar suture employ close flap interdental area . Two week post-surgery clinical observation uneventful heal presence adverse tissue reaction perform followed suture removal . Post-operative care Post-operative pain control Ibuprofen ( 600mg ) end surgical procedure 12h later pain . Amoxicillin ( 500mg / 8 hour five day ) prescribe participant . All patient instruct use 0.12 % chlorhexidine twice daily avoid brushing , floss chew hard treat area four week . During 4-week period , stringent post-operative supportive program care institute bi-weekly interval , patient discontinue rinse chlorhexidine solution resume oral hygiene . Interdental cleaning commence six week post-surgery Groups . Thereafter , subject see three , six 12 month periodontal supportive care . Clinical recording Full-mouth site-specific periodontal recording include BOP ; Plaque Index ( presence/absence plaque ) ; PPD CAL determine use manual periodontal probe ( Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW ) near millimetre six site per tooth parallel long axis four time-points ; baseline , 6- , 9- , 12-months . Clinical measurement designate site ( infrabony defect ) determine prior surgery anaesthesia ( baseline ) . Intra-surgical assessment carry surgery . Intra-surgical clinical assessment The defect morphology ( one- , two- , three-walls combination ) determine intra-surgically number bone wall associate lesion ; The distance cemento-enamel junction bottom defect ( CEJ-BD ) determine mm ; The distance CEJ coronal interproximal level bone crest ( CEJ-BC ) determine mm ; The total defect depth : distance bone crest bottom defect ( BC-BD ) determine mm ; The width defect width ( horizontal distance bone crest root surface ) determine mm . If CEJ detectable due cervical restoration restoration margin ( RM ) serve reference point clinical radiographic measurement . Radiographic evaluation Intraoral digital radiography utilised determine bone regeneration infrabony defect six time point ; baseline , 6-weeks , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-months . Standardised periapical digital radiograph ( RadioVisioGraphy ; Trophy Radiology S.A. , Paris , France ) obtain use long-cone paralleling technique . To standardise exposure geometry , customise bite-block elastic impression material adjust sensor holder , store seal plastic container room temperature reuse every recall radiographic appointment . In similar manner intra-surgical assessment , follow anatomical landmark define x-ray : cementoenamel junction ( CEJ ) , coronal level alveolar bone ( BC ) apical extent bone loss ( BD ) . In detail , location CEJ identify ; coronal area periodontal ligament retains even width identify radiograph indicate apical extension bone loss . The infrabony defect calculate measure width defect coronal aspect base ; distance CEJ-BD BC-BD ; distance CEJ-BC ; angle vertical axis root interdental bone wall ( Tonetti et al . 1993 ) . Radiographic evaluation bone regeneration define high definition monitor calibrate examiner blind treatment modality access previous recording . Assessments carry use measurement tool numerical measurement ( VixWin™ Platinum|Gendex software ) reference metal bar standard length ( 5mm ) attach onto sensor . Collection specimens Samples collect follow order six time point ; baseline , 6-weeks , 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-months . ( ) Saliva Saliva collect prior clinical periodontal measurement periodontal intervention generally morning follow overnight fast subject request drink ( except water ) chew gum . Whole saliva sample obtain expectorate 30ml polypropylene tube 5 minute . ( ii ) GCF Gingival crevicular fluid sample obtain buccal interdental aspect defect .
