	<brief_summary>ICU patient high risk ionic metabolic disturbance course critical illness . Some disturbance might life-threatening require rapid response physician . Point-of-Care determination electrolyte , glucose , hemoglobin hematocrit ensure early detection ( within 1 minute ) abnormal value allow rapid appropriate therapy . This technology largely improve quality care ICU . However , accuracy measurement parameter close enough reference method , usually perfomed central lab time consume . Recently , novel generation blood gas analyser release . Among , RapidPoint 500 mount 28-day cartridge provide automatic calibration quality control several time day . Such technology dramatically decrease need lab technical intervention . To date , data report accuracy device . Therefore , investigator ' aim compare accuracy RapidPoint 500 reference measurement perform central laboratory ( Beckman &amp; Coulter AU5800 electrolytes Beckman &amp; Coulter DXH hemoglobin ) .</brief_summary>
