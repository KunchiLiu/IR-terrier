	<brief_summary>Background : An anatomical reconstruction ankle congruity important prerequisite operative treatment acute ankle fracture . But , despite anatomic reduction , patient suffer residual problem like chronic pain , stiffness , persistent swell instability fracture . There grow evidence , poor outcome relate concomitant traumatic intraarticular pathology . Therefore , supplementary ankle arthroscopy propose acute ankle fracture valuable tool confirm anatomic reposition identify manage associate intraarticular injury . The arthroscopic treatment pathology might result good outcome complex ankle fracture . Nevertheless , , vast majority ankle fracture manage open procedure . Still , indication arthroscopically assist open reduction internal fixation ( AORIF ) clearly state , effectiveness AORIF compare open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) yet determine complex ankle fracture . In context , prospective randomize study sufficiently answer open question . Therefore , investigator plan randomize controlled trial intend report short- , midterm- long-term follow-up patient underwent operative treatment acute ankle fracture - without ankle arthroscopy . Methods/Study design : The investigator perform randomize controlled trial evaluate effect AORIF compare ORIF sample size 40 patient per group . The investigator include patient acute ankle fracture write informed consent . Primary outcome investigator ' study difference AOFAS score ( American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society ) intervention ( AORIF ) comparison ( ORIF ) group follow-up 2 year . Several secondary outcome parameter assess well . Statistical analysis perform use two-sided Student ` t-test . Discussion : Until today , two randomize control trial evaluate effect open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) compare arthroscopically assist open reduction internal fixation ( AORIF ) . Both study include patient isolated fracture distal fibula level syndesmosis . These simple fracture regularly treat operatively . Both study document high incidence intraarticular disorder AORIF group , one could show significant good result AORIF group . Moreover , several study could consistently demonstrate intraarticular damage even pronounce complex fracture . Consequently , distinctive effect arthroscopy complex fracture involve two malleoli assume compare simple fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute ankle fracture one lead pathology disturb ankle congruence . These fracture extremely common incidence 0.1-0.2 % per year . The treatment acute ankle fracture determine classification injury base radiographic finding . Operative treatment perform open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) standard care unstable dislocate ankle fracture . Anatomical realignment joint restoration ankle stability main goal operative treatment . Over last decade improve functional outcome emphasize importance anatomic reconstruction . Nevertheless , successful anatomical reduction automatically lead favorable clinical outcome . According several study , mid- long-term outcome follow operative treatment acute ankle fracture often poor even though anatomical reconstruction joint achieve . Residual problem acute ankle fracture include chronic pain , stiffness , recurrent swell instability . These problem occur despite operative restoration ankle congruence . There grow evidence poor outcome might mostly relate occult articular injury involve cartilage soft tissue damage . These intraarticular disorder show negatively affect clinical result , difficult diagnose intraarticular pathology physical examination , standard radiography even CT-scans . In context , many author well document value ankle arthroscopy . Ankle arthroscopy standard minimally invasive technique allow direct visualization intraarticular structure without arthrotomy malleolar osteotomy . In last decade , become safe effective diagnostic therapeutic procedure . In acute ankle fracture , arthroscopically assist open reduction internal fixation ( AORIF ) allow careful examination chondral aspect well capsular intraarticular ligament . If necessary , traumatic intraarticular pathology directly address remove loose body rupture ligament extend joint , perform chondroplasty micro fracture necessary . Furthermore , allow confirmation anatomic reduction without evidence supplementary ankle arthroscopy acute ankle fracture treatment lead high complication rate . Until today , two randomize control trial evaluate effect additional ankle arthroscopy . Both study available compare ORIF AORIF include patient isolated fracture distal fibula level syndesmosis . These simple fracture regularly treat operatively . Thodarson et al . compare ORIF treatment distal fibula fracture supplement without ankle arthroscopy find 8 9 patient articular damage talar dome arthroscopy group . Only minimal arthroscopic treatment require outcome difference note mean follow-up 21 month . Takao et al . document osteochondral lesion ( OCL ) 74 % arthroscopic group . In study , mean AOFAS score significantly well patient treat arthroscopically . Moreover , several study could consistently document , intraarticular damage pronounce complex fracture . Consequently , one must assume distinctive effect arthroscopy complex fracture involve two malleoli - compare simple fracture . Nevertheless , , vast majority ankle fracture manage open procedure . Still , indication AORIF clearly state , effectiveness AORIF compare ORIF yet determine complex ankle fracture investigator would expect even good result intraarticular lesion common fracture type . Moreover , prognostic importance traumatic articular lesion still remain unclear , although several study suggest injury may source functional deficit . Nevertheless , concept seem intuitively comprehensible . In context , prospective randomize study sufficiently answer open question . Therefore , investigator plan randomize controlled trial intend report short- , midterm- long-term follow-up patient underwent operative treatment acute ankle fracture ( AO A2 , A3 , B2 , B3 , C1-C3 ) - without ankle arthroscopy .</detailed_description>
