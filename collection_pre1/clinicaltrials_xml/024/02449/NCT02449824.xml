	<brief_summary>Firstly , investigator aim show breast tumour blood flow , measure part standard MRI examination , decrease early stage neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient go respond treatment . Importantly , investigator also show blood flow decrease patient fail respond . Secondly , investigator test whether decrease tumour blood flow whole course neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response tumour measure time surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>) Background . In recent pilot study 18 patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) , investigator demonstrate first time feasible measure breast tumour blood flow ( TBF ) part standard clinical MRI exam . TBF decrease dramatically clinical responder compare similar result obtain others use [ 15-O ] H2O positron emission tomography , data lead investigator hypothesise TBF decrease 1 cycle NAC responder . The data also suggest change TBF course NAC might predict pathological response . ii ) Aims . The primary aim ass response first line NAC non-invasively 1 cycle treatment . A secondary aim predict pathological response base upon change measure course NAC . iii ) Techniques Methodology . The investigator measure TBF use novel MRI approach 40 patient study , follow 1 cycle , mid-point end fix course NAC . The MRI data compare histological molecular marker , obtain biopsy baseline 1 cycle NAC specimen obtain surgery end NAC , assess mechanism response chemotherapy . In sub-study 10 patient imaged twice baseline investigator assess reproducibility TBF measure . iv ) Impact breast cancer research . These technique provide absolute measure tumour function therapy particularly benefit non-responders first line NAC allow clear objective decision make possible early change treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnose large operable invasive carcinoma breast . All molecular subtypes eligible incidentally detect small volume metastatic disease NOT exclusion criterion . Clinical indication NAC determine Breast Therapeutic MDT . Sufficient biopsy material take diagnosis measure standard molecular marker . Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Female , age 18 year . Histologically cytologically confirm invasive carcinoma breast receive prior treatment . Female participant child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception study . Participant adequate renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate â‰¥ 30 ml/min ) . In Investigator 's opinion , able willing comply study requirement . Previous breast cancer treat radiotherapy chemotherapy recurrent breast cancer . Female participant pregnant , lactate plan pregnancy course study . Significant renal impairment ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min ) . Contraindication MRI .</criteria>
