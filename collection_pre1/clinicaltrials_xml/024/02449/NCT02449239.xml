	<brief_title>Vicinium Treatment Subjects With Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Previously Treated With BCG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer 6th common cancer United States , affect men woman . The usual first treatment NMIBC ( Ta , T1 , CIS ) transurethral resection bladder tumor follow intravesical immunotherapy , commonly bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) . Because high risk development muscle invasive disease , cystectomy recommend CIS high-grade Ta T1 patient experience disease recurrence follow intravesical therapy . For patient unable unwilling undergo cystectomy , treatment option limit . Vicinium contain active pharmaceutical ingredient VB4-845 , recombinant fusion protein produce Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) express humanized single-chain antibody fragment specific epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) antigen link ETA ( 252-608 ) . Once bound EpCAM antigen surface carcinoma cell , Vicinium internalize endocytic pathway . The ETA ( 252-608 ) cleave induces cell death irreversibly block protein synthesis . In vitro vivo pharmacology demonstrate Vicinium exhibit potent activity [ inhibitory concentration 50 % ( IC50 ) = 0.001 - 10 pM ] numerous cell line effectively inhibit tumor growth several human xenograft animal model . A Phase 2 study evaluate once-weekly instillation Vicinium 30 mg 6 12 week , follow 3 maintenance cycle ( 3 once-weekly instillation follow 9-week drug-free period ) 45 subject histologically-confirmed TCC bladder residual CIS without concurrent Ta T1 refractory intolerant BCG . A complete response ( defined histological evidence disease negative urine cytology 3-monthly evaluation ) achieve 44 % subject , 16 % subject remain disease-free 1-year . A post-study assessment find subject still disease-free 18-25 month . The median time recurrence 134 day longer subject receive 12 week induction therapy compare 6 week . This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter study adult NMIBC , specifically CIS ( without papillary disease ) , high-grade Ta grade T1 papillary disease , previously fail BCG treatment ( i.e. , intolerant ) without interferon . The study consist Screening period , 12-week Induction Phase , Maintenance Phase 21 monthly cycle total treatment period 104 week . This outpatient study , treatment administer study clinic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologicallyconfirmed non muscleinvasive urothelial carcinoma ( transitional cell carcinoma ) bladder follow : 1 . CIS ( without papillary disease ) OR 2 . Any grade T1 papillary disease OR 3 . Highgrade Ta papillary disease base biopsy within 8 week initial dose study treatment . If multiple bladder biopsy require confirm eligibility , last bladder biopsy initial dose study treatment must within 8 week . This diagnosis must confirm independent central pathology reviewer prior subject enrollment . A subject persistent T1 disease second ( i.e. , restaging ) TURBT may enrol study investigator document subject decline cystectomy . 2 . Subjects must receive adequate BCG treatment define least 2 course BCG , i.e. , least one induction one maintenance course least 2 induction course . The initial induction course must least 5 treatment within 7week period . The second course ( induction maintenance ) must least 2 treatment within 6week period . The `` 5+2 '' dos BCG must give within approximately 1 year ( i.e. , start one course start second course within 12 month ±1 month ) disease episode subject enrolling . Treatment must consider `` fulldose '' BCG ( see Section 10 ) . If additional dos course BCG minimum `` 5+2 '' give , within approximate 12 month timeframe . Subjects unable receive least 5 dos BCG first course least 2 dos BCG second course due intolerance eligible . Subjects begin initial course BCG `` fulldose '' BCG require dosereductions due adverse event still able tolerate least `` 5+2 '' dos BCG consider meet requirement `` adequate BCG . '' Subjects receive less `` full dose '' BCG ( e.g. , 1/3rd dose ) standard regimen due dose reduction AEs eligible . The BCG may give combination interferon . When BCG give simultaneously combination interferon , 1/3rd dose BCG acceptable . 3 . The subject 's disease refractory relapse follow adequate BCG treatment . Refractory disease define disease persists first evaluation follow adequate BCG . Relapsed disease define complete response adequate BCG recur subsequent evaluation . Subjects enroll one three cohort base type disease time refractory/relapsed disease follow last dose BCG follow : Cohort 1 : Subjects CIS without associate papillary disease whose disease determine refractory relapse within 6 month last dose adequate BCG treatment . Cohort 2 : Subjects CIS without associate papillary disease whose disease determine refractory relapse 6 month within 11 month last dose adequate BCG treatment . Cohort 3 : Subjects highgrade Ta grade T1 papillary disease ( without CIS ) whose disease determine refractory relapse within 6 month last dose adequate BCG treatment . For eligibility cohort assignment , 6 month define 30 week i.e. , 26 week ( 6 month ) plus additional 4 week accommodate schedule variation diagnostic workup 11 month define 50 week i.e. , 48 week ( 11 month ) plus additional 2 week accommodate schedule variation diagnostic workup . For subject enrol Cohort 2 : The investigator document he/she would treat subject additional BCG time study entry . 4 . Male nonpregnant , nonbreastfeeding female , age 18 year old date consent . 5 . All woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative pregnancy test within 7 day first dose study therapy . A woman childbearing potential undergone surgical sterilization ( bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy ) ≥55 year age menstrual bleeding kind include menstrual period , irregular bleeding , spot , etc. , least 12 month cause amenorrhea ( e.g. , hormonal therapy , prior chemotherapy ) . 6 . All sexually active subject agree use barrier contraception ( i.e. , condom ) receive study treatment 120 day follow last dose study treatment . WOCBP male whose sexual partner WOCBP agree use barrier contraception second form contraception receive study treatment 120 day follow last dose study treatment . 7 . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 ( Appendix 1 ) . 8 . Adequate organ function , define follow criterion : Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 ) ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN ; creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min ; Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL ; Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mm3 ; Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 9 . Ability understand sign Independent Ethics Committee Institutional Review Boardapproved inform consent document indicate subject ( legally acceptable representative ) inform aspect trial willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . The informed consent document must sign prior subject undergoing test procedure solely determine study eligibility prior receive protocol treatment . 1 . The subject pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Evidence urethral upper tract transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) within past 2 year . Subjects T1 disease must evidence upper low tract disease advance stage disease CT urogram MRI urogram abdomen pelvis perform within 8 week first dose study treatment . If intravenous contrast contraindicate , retrograde ureteropyelography , CT MRI without intravenous contrast may perform . 3 .

The average 3 QTcF 's used determine eligibility . Known suspected cause prolong QTc treat ( e.g. , hypocalcemia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesimia ) ECGs may repeat . If subject initiate treatment drug know prolong QTc Screening period initial Screening ECGs obtain , Screening ECGs must repeat new drug reach steady state ensure average QTcF remain ≤470 msec . For subject 's whose heart rate &lt; 60 bpm , Bazett correction formula ( QTcB ) may use . 9 .
