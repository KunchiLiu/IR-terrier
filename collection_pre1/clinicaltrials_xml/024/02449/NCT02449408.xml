	<brief_title>Novel Screening Tools For Evaluation Management Malnourished Children Developing World</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study validate novel screening tool evaluation management malnourish infant child develop world . The study validate 2-D diffusion point care test ( POCT ) rapid analysis leptin adiponectin , cytokine show predict mortality malnourish infant child . The study enroll 20 participant , 10 overweight obese adolescent present Duke Division Pediatric Endocrinology outpatient clinic , leptin expect high adiponectin low , 10 premature small gestational age infant hospitalize Duke Transitional Care Nursery , leptin expect low adiponectin high . Informed consent obtain 0-1 mL blood collect analyzed use 2-D POCT commercial ELISA assay . To reduce potential risk associate venipuncture and/or finger heelstick , blood draw purpose study take place blood sampling perform request primary provider , attempt make utilize scavenge sample infant applicable . The POCT validate commercial ELISA assay . The investigator analyze result assay addition mean standard deviation POCT ELISAs consider POCT valid variation ELISA &lt; 20 % . The long-term goal project utilize novel technology identify treat high-risk malnourish infant child reach stage critical , life-threatening illness .</detailed_description>
