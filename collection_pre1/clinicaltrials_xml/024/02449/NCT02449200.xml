	<brief_title>RCT Multimodal Physiotherapy Acute / Sub-acute Cervical Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical radiculopathy ( CR ) define North American Spine Society ( NASS ) pain radicular pattern one upper extremity relate compression and/or irritation one cervical nerve root , sign symptom include vary degree sensory , motor , reflex change addition dysaesthesia paraesthesia ( Bono et al . 2011 ) . CR particular clinical concern , give high level pain disability associate presence nerve-related arm pain result high healthcare cost cohort people neck pain ( Rubinstein et al. , 2007 , Haldeman et al. , 2008 ) . Multimodal physiotherapy involve manual therapy exercise demonstrate positive effect pain disability chronic ( symptom duration &gt; 3 month ) CR ( Boyles et al. , 2011 ) . No consensus optimum conservative management , indeed optimal timing management , currently exist acute / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy . The combined use manual therapy exercise cohort garner interest ; evident emergence several randomise control trial ( Nee et al. , 2012 , Langevin et al. , 2015 ) involve treatment duration 2-4 week . Langevin et al . ( 2015 ) demonstrate use 2 varied programme manual therapy &amp; exercise , lead similarly clinically significant improvement pain disability , particularly immediately 4 week intervention . However , without 'no treatment ' control group , natural recovery could exclude , confirm need adequate control group future trial ( Langevin et al. , 2015 ) . The recent Cochrane review exercise treatment mechanical neck disorder ( MND ) ( include CR ) conclude low quality evidence suggest small pain reduction benefit cervical stretch / strengthen / stabilization exercise short term acute cervical radiculopathy ( Gross et al. , 2015 ) . They also advocate large sample size longer follow-up period future trial . A randomised control trial 4 week course multimodal physiotherapy package ( manual therapy ( spinal joint ) , exercise ( mobility exercise , deep neck flexor scapular muscle training ) , upper limb unload tape ( offload brachial plexus ) advice stay active ) acute/sub-acute CR propose . As strong evidence establish best clinical practice conservative management acute/sub-acute CR , control group advice stay active medication use . Aims &amp; Objectives : The primary aim trial investigate effect 4 week multimodal physiotherapy ( MP ) programme neck arm pain result disability CR , 6 month , primary endpoint 4 week . Secondary objective : - investigate effect MP programme follow additional biopsychosocial outcome measure ; - Cervical range motion - Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test ( ULNT ) 1 - Pressure Pain Thresholds ( PPT ) - Quality Life - Anxiety Depression - Fear Avoidance belief - Patient rating recovery - identify whether biopsychosocial outcome measure , well PainDETECT Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaires ( SFMPQ ) baseline , post hoc MRI finding group allocation ; predict outcome GROC scale . Hypothesis : A 4 week multimodal physiotherapy programme lead change self-reported disability pain , compare advice stay active , acute / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy . Research Design : An exploratory , assessor-blinded , randomise control trial plan . Procedure : A consecutive sample new patient cervical radiculopathy refer general practitioner neurosurgical assessment Beaumont Hospital recruit . An additional private physiotherapy practice site also add January 2016 increase availability treatment . Eligibility assessment include neurological exam manual exam cervical spine ( C2-T2 ) identify nerve root level guide treat physiotherapist participant subsequently assign intervention group . If eligible upon provide write consent , prior baseline assessment random group allocation , participant ask PI belief regard likely effectiveness physiotherapy , well belief need surgery . Participants randomly assign intervention control group independent academic colleague use computer-generated list random number random block size 4 , 6 8 . Participants allocate control group advise continue take prescribed counter medication , well stay active , treat physiotherapist . They telephone weekly 4 week . Participants allocate intervention group attend Physiotherapy Department Beaumont Hospital Collins Avenue Physiotherapy clinic 4 week programme multi-modal physiotherapy involve advice , manual therapy , exercise upper limb unload tape , decide treat physiotherapist best-practice physiotherapy treatment guide . Participants intervention group treat twice week 30 minute session receive non-provocative manual therapy ( participant receive lateral glide mobilisation ( Vicenzino et al. , 1999 ) mechanical interface radiculopathy additional Maitland joint mobilisation segmental level ( far T4 ) deem necessary treat physiotherapist base mobility assessment ) , exercise ( participant receive deep neck flexor strengthen scapular orientation exercise deem necessary treat physiotherapist base motor control assessment ( Jull et al. , 2008 ) ) cervical mobility exercise . Upper limb neural unloading tape applied end treatment session . The tape run upper arm , top shoulder across back neck unload brachial plexus . Experienced senior physiotherapist master 's degree musculoskeletal physiotherapy ( equivalent ) provide treatment programme . Treating physiotherapist also record participant ' adherence home exercise programme administer weekly exercise adherence questionnaire monitor participant 's home exercise frequency per week . Medication usage participant group monitor weekly basis . In case significant adverse event ( progressive neurological sign e.g . multilevel bilateral radiculopathy , myotomal paresis &lt; 4/5 MRC scale ; emerge medical red flag cervical spondylotic myelopathy ) trial , appropriate clinical pathway follow . The clinical change discuss neurosurgical registrar requirement fast track clinical review determine . Minor adverse event also record trial . Participants group assess principal investigator end treatment 4 week 12 week . Participants ' report pain disability rating recovery also record telephone interview 6 month . Baseline demographic record include co-morbidities , educational level , smoke status , occupation work status change work status subsequent assessment time point note . Participants ask pursue treatment trial , 12 week assessment . All intervention receive recorded 6 month telephone follow . Sample size estimation : The NDI NPRS co-primary outcome measure study sample size estimate carry outcome measure . An MCID NDI 7 determine cervical radiculopathy patient ( Cleland et al. , 2006 ) . Using report NDI SD 9.2 ( Cleland et al. , 2006 ) patient group , two-sided 5 % significance level power 80 % , sample size 29 participant per group necessary . An MCID NPRS 2 determine mechanical neck pain , include cervical radiculopathy ( Cleland et al. , 2008 ) SD 1.85 ( Cleland et al. , 2006 ) . Using figure , two-sided 5 % significance level power 80 % , sample size 15 per group calculate . The large sample size per group calculate use NDI choose additional 10 % added account anticipate dropout . In total , sample size 64 participant recruit . Pilot study : A pilot feasibility study undertaken , objective test recruitment strategy retention rate study . The pilot study mirror protocol main study except assessment time point limit baseline 4 week ( end treatment intervention group ) pilot run 2 month first 6 participant reach 4 week assessment . Criteria assess success feasibility study ( Thabane et al. , 2010 ) : - 6 participant recruit per month . To recruit sample size estimate 12 month period , 5 participant per month need recruit . - Complete follow-up possible least 95 % recruited participant . The pilot study also identify difference retention rate exist group , follow participant 4 week assessment point . Participants control group also ask acceptable would find continue medication advice stay active 8 week , assess likelihood dropout second third assessment time point . Results pilot study include main study result significant protocol change require pilot . A second recruitment pathway , via direct general practitioner ( GP ) referral primary care commence pilot October 2015 , clear initial recruitment strategy inadequate pilot . This pathway approve Irish College General Practitioners Research Ethics Committee September 2015 . Data analysis : Baseline demographic characteristic outcome measure describe present group follow CONSORT Statement . Data check normality use Shapiro-Wilk test . Differences baseline characteristic 2 group evaluate linear regression model used investigate group effect outcomes , include baseline level outcome adjust baseline imbalance know predictor variable . Results report adjusted mean difference group confidence interval . Poisson regression use data non-parametric . Statistical analysis include two-way ( treatment x time ) ANOVAs MANOVAs within-group difference interaction . Intention treat analysis primary approach employ . A secondary per protocol analysis also undertaken . Secondary analysis explore outcome measure group allocation predictor outcome ( GROC score 3 month ) perform use appropriate multivariable regression analysis .</detailed_description>
