The secondary objective investigate early life risk factor development asthma allergic disease well disease may share common risk factor , include cardiovascular disease , obesity diabetes . Design : A multi-national population-based prospective birth cohort factorial design randomize control intervention trial two clinical intervention ; skin care 0-9 month early food introduction 3-4 month , thereafter observation .

	<detailed_description>The PreventADALL study long term prospective birth cohort study enrol pregnant woman allow intra-uterine investigation baby maternal factor pregnancy , thereafter include new-born baby long-term follow-up investigation . With knowledge allergic disease often manifest early infancy , intervention carry early possible investigate allergic disease prevent . Two intervention , early systematic introduction common food , early skin care carry within first four month first nine month life , respectively . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : Ante-natal inclusion , step 1 : All mother to-be 18 week ultrasound investigation sufficient language skill ( Norwegian Swedish ) , gestational age : least 16-22 week . Exclusion : Plans move reasonable travel distance participate hospital within first year offspring 's life . Inclusion child , step 2 : Live-born baby gestational age 35.0 week ( include multiple pregnancy ) , maternal/parental willingness participate study Exclusion criterion child : 1 ) severe neonatal cardiac , pulmonary , neurologic , dermatologic disease disease may influence outcomes 2 ) , plan move reasonable travel distance away participate hospital within first nine month life . 3 ) Non-willingness participate 4 ) More two foetus two Overall design : A multi-national population-based prospective birth cohort factorial design randomize control intervention trial two clinical intervention ; skin care 0-9 month early food introduction 3-4 month , thereafter observation . Recruitment do two step ; first pregnant woman 18-weeks ultrasound investigation thereafter new-born baby . Randomisation four group do postal code `` bydeler '' ensure four intervention-groups within `` bydel '' . Electronic questionnaire complete mother 18 34 week gestation , well baby 3-6-9-12 month annually thereafter . Also , electronic diary complete week 2-26 week age , register weekly intervention , well symptoms allergic disease food intake . Visits biological environmental sampling , observation investigation relevant paediatric department ( 3-6-12-24 month age ) annually thereafter . It hope study maintain well adulthood . The study run accordance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) . Investigations : Clinical investigation biological sample focus : General development , clinical assessment health disease , well diagnose allergic disease later also non-communicable disease ( NCD ) s. These include : - Foetal growth respiratory development - Somatic growth status ( length , weight , body composition ) - Blood pressure - Skin , respiratory , gastrointestinal relevant organs - Skin barrier ( trans epidermal water loss ( TEWL ) ) - Lung function -development - Microbiota/diversity ( body environment ) - Viral infection - Immune-deviation/tolerance development - Specific allergen antibody ( IgE/IgG ) - Xenobiotics interaction exposure ( microbiota/xenobiotics ) - Genetics/epi-genetics Outcome measure : Primary outcome assess yearly , first time six month age : 1 . Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , Food allergy intervention allergen 2 . Allergic sensitisation ( yes/no well quantitative , skin prick test s-IgE ) Secondary outcome : annually ( ie 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month ) : asthma ( bronchial obstruction year 1-2 ) and/or food allergy allergen and/or anaphylaxis and/or allergic rhinitis Later outcome define term obesity , cardiovascular disease diabetes . Interventions : Skin intervention ( IS ) : Skin care perform week 2 8 month age , supervise study personnel prior leave hospital . Food intervention ( IF ) : Major food allergen ( cow 's milk , peanut , wheat , egg ) introduce later 4.0 month age taste , interfere nutrition . Safety assessment : An external surveying committee assess adverse event main outcome establish prior study start . The purpose observe potential large difference major outcome four group . Monitoring adverse event occur August 2015 December 2017 term main outcome : first baby 6 month , baby least nine month age . In case significant difference ( effect size determine ) committee may advice discontinuation intervention , close assessment continue intervention . Statistical approach : Stratum randomization , logistic regression analysis ( primary outcome ) , mixed model ( continuous outcome particularly allergic sensitisation quantification ) apply . An external surveillance committee establish , monthly report outcome , potential stop trial case large difference group . However , due short time span observation intervention complete , unlikely intervention difference may observe prior completion . Power analysis lack underlie data therefore base upon prevalence ( ECA study ) AD two year age skin barrier intervention . The prevalence ( % ) ( ever ) allergic disease ECA study 2 , 10 16 year age : Asthma : 8 ( recurrent bronchial obstruction ) , 20 26.4 % , Atopic eczema : 23.2 , 33.2 34.8 % , Allergic rhinitis ( 10 16 year ) : 19 32.1 % , Allergic sensitization ( 10/16 year ) : 37.4 52.6 % , respectively . Data food allergy lacking . The investigator ' pilot study suggest prevalence reduction AD 16 four % 6-months age child dry skin subject skin care 2 week . Thus , estimate reduction 23.2 % 18.2 % ( five per cent point ) general population would highly clinically relevant , worthwhile feasible require 1030 child skin care versus observation group attain 80 % power 5 % significance level . A reduction 19.2 % ( four per cent point ) require 1638 child per group . Recent publication demonstrate approximately 30 % reduction atopic dermatitis 32 week age daily use skin care 50 % risk reduction 6 month age 124 high risk child , respectively suggest approx . 2500 baby total sufficient detect significant relevant reduction AD factorially 2x2 design study . In line emerge study result ( 2015 ) power-estimates repeat potential modification population size requirement intil target population recruit . Study Phases : The first phase PreventADALL study ; establish birth cohort study , collect information biological sample , closely assess child first 2 year life , assess impact two intervention impact microbiota xenobiotic exposure early allergic disease presentation . This phase also create foundation long-term follow-up study careful assessment potential risk protective factor allergic well NCDs start life . The PreventADALL study lead improve knowledge potential effect primary prevention management allergic diseases early life well improve knowledge risk factor NCDs later life .</detailed_description>
