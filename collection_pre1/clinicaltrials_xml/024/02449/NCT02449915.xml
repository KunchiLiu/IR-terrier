	<brief_title>Improvement Pain Following Robotic Sacrocolpopexy Rectocele Repair Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last 20 year , laparoscopic surgery assume important role gynecological surgery . Unfortunately , patient survey indicate little improvement incidence severity postsurgical pain past two decade . Postoperative pain common complaint , occur 5-15 % patient show significantly contribute overall patient dissatisfaction . It lead increase consumption opioids , subsequent nausea , delay bowel function , prolong postoperative recovery . In attempt address pain related complication port-site wound , various method pain control attempt . Currently , standard care exist management base surgeon anesthesiologist preference . This study seek determine injection liposomal bupivacaine laparoscopic port sit rectocele repair incision completion robotic sacrocolpopexy concomitant rectocele repair result decrease postoperative pain compare injection placebo . The secondary aim study determine port site , , painful robotic sacrocolpopexy .</detailed_description>
