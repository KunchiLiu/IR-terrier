	<brief_title>Investigation Circulating Tumor Cells From Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTCs measurement take pre- post-RT treatment . CTCs measurement also take treatment . The CTCs measurement study provide essential information power sample size consideration future translational study , particularly look identify biomarkers possibly associate CTCs tumor response activity XRT , adequately power formal statistical comparison important association CTCs patient characteristic outcome .</detailed_description>

At least 1 site metastatic disease , many 5 site , addition primary tumor regional lymph node , amenable local ablative therapy external beam radiation , stereotactic cranial radiosurgery ( SRS ) stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . Treatment guide multidisciplinary evaluation may also include surgery , chemotherapy target agent discretion primary oncologist . Patients may present oligometastatic disease oligometastatic disease recurrence definitive therapy localize disease .
