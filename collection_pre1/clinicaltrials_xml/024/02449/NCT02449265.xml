	<brief_title>Efficacy Consolidative Involved-site Radiotherapy Patients With Limited-stage Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) heterogenous group lymphomas constitute approximately one-third non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis . At diagnosis , approximately 25 % 30 % patient find limited-stage disease ( stage I-II ) . The combined-modality therapy ( CMT ) include chemotherapy involved-field radiotherapy ( IFRT ) optimal management limited-stage DLBCL . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline recommend three cycle R-CHOP+IFRT early-stage , nonbulky disease also allow administration six eight cycle R-CHOP without IFRT . These patient favorable prognosis 5-year overall survival ( OS ) rate report 70 % 92 % follow curative-intent treatment . In fact , value consolidation radiotherapy ( RT ) limited-stage DLBCL uncertain several well-known report . These include report late relapse SWOG study , lack benefit add RT brief chemotherapy European study elderly patient , report advantage intensive chemotherapy regimen brief CHOP plus RT young patient study Europe . On hand , uncertain many cycle ' chemotherapy combine consolidation RT adequate maintain efficacy CMT patient limited-stage DLBCL . In trial GELA LNH 93-1 , aggressive chemotherapy alone , regimen dose-intensified doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , vindesine , bleomycin , prednisone ( ACVBP ) , design compare three cycle CHOP plus IFRT patient stage I-II mostly low-risk aggressive lymphoma . Patients receive dose-intensity chemotherapy significantly high 5-year event-free overall survival ( OS ) rate abbreviate therapy enough overcome excessive distant relapse . In SWOG 8736 trial , result clearly favor keep RT board , progression-free survival ( PFS ) OS curve three cycle CHOP+IFRT arm eight cycle CHOP arm begin overlap 7 year 9 year treatment excess number late lymphoma relapse group receive three cycle CHOP+IFRT . For patient old 60 year localize aggressive lymphoma , result GELA LNH 93-4 trial show 5-year event-free survival ( EFS ) OS significant difference four cycle CHOP alone four cycle CHOP follow radiation therapy . In summary , sufficient three cycle CHOP systemic treatment abbreviate therapy treat limited-stage DLBCL accord result previous randomized trial . These finding consistent retrospective result M. D. Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) . Six eight cycle chemotherapy may adequate management patient limited-stage DLBCL receive RT ensure significantly well outcome . In order increase clinical benefit decrease late complication relate irradiation and/or chemotherapy , consolidation RT follow chemotherapy patient limited-stage DLBCL direct recent year . This base observation local recurrence common pattern first failure follow systemic therapy alone IFRT achieve excellent infield control original site disease . Improved local control , achieve addition radiotherapy , may translate improvement long-term outcome . The advantage addition RT obvious reduction adverse event dose-intensified cycle ' chemotherapy , increase local control , even improvement OS . However , complication related consolidation RT , include second malignancy non-neoplastic late event , also need emphasize patient limited-stage DLBCL , cure long-term survival . Reducing morbidity treatment important consideration optimize therapeutic ratio . The prefer option include radiation field size reduction radiotherapy dose decrease . The general dose guide 30-36Gy manage patient complete response ( CR ) chemotherapy 40-50Gy partial response ( PR ) . Comparing extensive-field radiotherapy , brief chemotherapy follow IFRT early-stage disease safe significantly effective . In order maintain high rate local disease control achieve RT , minimize risk radiation-induced toxicity , limited radiotherapy field size change IFRT reasonable margin gross tumor report patient limited-stage DLBCL . The Korean retrospective result report Yu show OS relapse-free survival ( RFS ) 10 year manage Involved-node radiotherapy ( INRT ) follow median 4 cycle CHOP R-CHOP chemotherapy treatment result compare IFRT 86 patient stage I , II head neck DLBCL . The radiotherapy field size INRT localize cover prechemotherapy gross disease margin least 2 3 cm include ipsilateral whole neck . Aim reduce radiotherapy-induced toxicity , Campbell et al . reduced field size IFRT INRT＜5 cm treatment limited-stage DLBCL abbreviate systemic therapy consolidation RT . The result show distant-only relapse common pattern first failure , marginal-only relapse reassuringly infrequent ( 2 % ) group INRT . The TTP , PFS , OS n't affect radiotherapy field reduction . Smaller RT field translate low rate radiation-induced toxicity radiation-induced second malignancy long-term survivor . Unfortunately , limitation INRT report previous study undertake . The involved site head neck comparison arm design Korean research . Though result Campbell et al show reduce field size IFRT INRT＜5 cm maintains low marginal recurrence risk impact overall outcome , research retrospective n't analyze whether efficacy consolidation INRT affect response chemotherapy . Moreover , clinical target volume ( CTV ) INRT research Campbell et al encompass prechemotherapy volume disease , within postchemotherapy anatomical limit instead biologic region subclinical gross disease . At time , physical concept , plan target volume ( PTV ) must form CTV consider physiological movement interfraction set-up variation . For , up-to 5 cm direct `` involved-node radiotherapy margin 5 cm ( INRT＜5 cm ) `` Campbell et al account non-uniform margin . The actual radiotherapy field size vary accord discretion treat radiation oncologist . It necessary research without limitation previous study design evaluate efficacy RT small RT field size follow sufficient systemic treatment patient limited-stage DLBCL . Involved-site radiotherapy ( ISRT ) , base modify involved field , aim reduce radiation volume treat probability late effect . Its radiation target include gross tumor volume ( GTV ) , clinical target volume ( CTV ) , plan target volume ( PTV ) , define International Commission Radiation Units Measurements Report ( ICRU ) 50 . This base defining site gross disease chemotherapy , GTV use CT-based volume expansion form CTV cranio-caudal direction . Compared IFRT , PFS toxicity relate involved-site radiotherapy ( ISRT ) evaluate CR PR patient limited-stage DLBCL sufficient systemic treatment . The CTV ISRT define region include prechemotherapy volume disease 1.5 cm margin expand cranio-caudally direction potential lymphatic spread . The CTV extend air transverse plane limit involved lymph node region define Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) . The PTV extend CTV add necessary margin setup error organ motion .</detailed_description>
