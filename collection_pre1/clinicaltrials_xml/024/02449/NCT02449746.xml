	<brief_summary>Psychosis mental health problem cause people perceive interpret thing differently around , often involve hallucination delusion . Psychosis schizophrenia common disorder predominantly affect young adult . Recently , investigator discover 5-10 % people psychosis antibody blood capable target surface brain cell , specific N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor voltage gate potassium channel complex , investigator believe may cause problem . Those positive antibody may problem immune system may prevent brain work normally . This trial aim test feasibility remove reduce antibody patient ' blood , use immunotherapy , see improves symptom psychosis . Immunotherapy feasibility study involve give patient steroid tablet half also receive drug call `` intravenous immunoglobulin '' whereas half procedure call `` plasma exchange '' . The feasibility study design identify method immunotherapy suitable use patient population . Results inform methodology use propose large randomise control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Immunotherapy Autoantibody Positive Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An autoimmune disease occur person 's immune system begin respond normal bodily substances tissue foreign related disease . There number autoimmune disorder , affect brain target surface brain cell , example signal protein like NMDA receptor voltage gate potassium channel complex . Some case encephalitis , disorder brain inflammation autoimmune , cause antibody , often present psychotic experience , hallucination , may see psychiatrist stage , go experience seizure brain swelling , see neurologist . These patient treat immunotherapy , treatment see reduction seizures psychotic symptom . Recently investigator identify patient psychosis test positive antibody , go experience symptom encephalitis . It suggest patient suffer autoimmune disorder similar encephalitis describe . Small pilot study antibody positive psychosis patient show various immunotherapy reduce symptom psychosis number autoantibody present blood . A randomised clinical trial ( RCT ) require confirm . However feasibility study require first investigate whether possible deliver immunotherapy treatment patient psychosis . The treatment require infusion hour ( IVIG ) admission acute medical ward several day ( plasma exchange ) . Both may challenge people paranoid agitate . The investigator need assess whether possible deliver treatment proceed large scale , clinical trial . This multicentre , randomise , uncontrolled , open label feasibility study . Patients psychosis positive blood test antibody identify one 24 recruiting centre across England . They undergo screen assessment eligibility ( interview psychiatrist neurologist baseline investigation possible , include MRI , EEG lumbar puncture ) give inform consent study . A blood sample ( 10ml ) take future research . 10 Participants randomise one two clinical care pathway : either infusion intravenous immunoglobulin , plasma exchange treatment . Both group receive steroid tablet , group continue receive psychiatric treatment , include antipsychotic medication , normal . At two month randomisation research team speak treat clinician gather primary outcome measure whether patient receive allocated treatment within two week allocation . The researcher may also confirm outcome clinical record .</detailed_description>
