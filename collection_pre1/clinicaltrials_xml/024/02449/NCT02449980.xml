	<brief_title>Primary Versus Delayed Surgical Therapy Pediatric Spontaneous Pneumothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . All child present Texas Children 's Hospital primary spontaneous pneumothorax potentially eligible study . 2 . After diagnosis make initial medical therapy initiate , patient identify parent legal guardian approach staff surgeon consent participate study . The attend pediatric surgeon surgical fellow discus trial eligible patient family . 3 . Written , inform consent obtain research nurse coordinator , pediatric surgical fellow , attend pediatric surgeon . 4 . Once enrolled , patient randomize primary Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ( VATS ) , blebectomy mechanical pleurodesis versus initial nonoperative treatment . 5 . Prior initiate study , randomization sequence computer-generated independent statistician use permuted block random allocation scheme block size 4,6 . The randomization sequence conceal maintain sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope use carbon paper aluminum foil insert . This keep locked cabinet PI 's office ; access enrollment occur inclusion criterion verify admit staff surgeon assign treatment group . The participant surgeon blind group assignment . 6 . Primary Surgery Group . Patients randomize primary surgical intervention group undergo VATS , apical blebectomy mechanical pleurodesis initial hospital admission admit staff surgeon . The general principle surgical technique consist 3-port thoracoscopic approach ( 2-5mm , 1-10mm ) , staple apical blebectomy ( vascular 2.5mm stapler ) , apical pleura abrasion , placement chest tube . Variations technique discretion surgeon . 7 . Initial non-operative management group . Those randomized control group admit chest tube percutaneous drainage catheter manage accord standard protocol . This consist minimum 48 hour Pleur-Evac suction daily chest radiograph . The drainage tube place water seal resolution pneumothorax document x-ray , well absence air leak . If clinical radiographic change water seal period 12 hour , chest tube remove . A post-removal chest radiograph obtain patient discharge clinical radiographic criterion meet . `` Rescue '' VATS/ blebectomy/pleurodesis perform manage initially nonoperatively meet criterion surgery thereafter ( i.e . develop persistent air leak drainage tube placement ) . A persistent air leak define bubble air Pleur-Evac water chamber upon elicit positive pressure last &gt; 4 day , note documented progress note attend physician . If recurrence identify control group , manage operatively , per current clinical practice , VATS/ blebectomy/pleurodesis . 8 . Discharge Criteria . Discharge criterion include afebrile 24 hour , normal oxygen saturation oxygen requirement , benign physical exam , unchanged improve post-removal chest radiograph , ability tolerate regular diet ambulate , pain well control oral pain medication . 9 . Discharge Instructions . A discussion take place surgical team family prior discharge order review standardize discharge instruction . These address understand patient family sign symptom recurrent pneumothorax well specific follow appointment schedule phone follow-up thereafter . For patient primary surgery , specific postoperative instruction give accord current clinical practice . 10 . Follow-up . Follow-up group take place 2-3 week hospital discharge ( per standard care ) , subsequent telephone interview 3 month , 6 month 12 month . 11 . The primary outcome regard effectiveness primary VATS overall recurrence rate 12 month . Secondary outcome include surgical complication rate , cumulative hospital length stay ( total number hospital day study period ) , time resumption usual activity , direct variable hospital cost . The recurrence rate define proportion patient recurrent ipsilateral pneumothorax follow-up period . Complications assess include surgical site infection , persistent air leak ( &gt; 4 day ) , prolong need chest tube ( quantified number chest tube day ) . Standard National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( NSQIP ) definition outcomes utilized . The time resumption usual activity adjudicate time post-op follow visit mean phone interview 2-3 week postoperatively . The long time period resumption usual activity ascertain patient questionnaire address return school date , level pre- post-illness activity , daily activity log keep patient parent .</detailed_description>
