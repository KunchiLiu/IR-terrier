	<brief_title>The Palliative Benefit Involved-site Radiotherapy Patients With Advanced-stage Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) common subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Approximately 50 % patient present stage III-IV disease diagnosis . The standard treatment approach patient combination chemotherapy . role radiation therapy ( RT ) effective system therapy stage III-IV DLBCL ( advanced-stage DLBCL ) controversial . The recommended approach patient stage III-IV disease The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) consolidation RT manage patient achieve complete response ( CR ) chemotherapy palliative RT patient partial response ( PR ) chemotherapy . However , uncertain radiotherapy field size treat patient chemotherapy . Some benefit consolidation RT chemotherapy exist patient advanced-stage DLBCL . One important aim treatment patient improvement event-free survival ( EFS ) . After patient receive chemotherapy alone , common site disease recurrence sit initial disease involvement . The complication related chemotherapy , include second malignancy non-neoplastic late event , need emphasize patient manage cycle ' regimen alone increase efficacy patient advanced-stage DLBCL . Receipt consolidation RT associate improved in-field control EFS though difference overall survival ( OS ) compare patient without consolidation RT . Several randomized retrospective study demonstrate EFS ( even OS ) improve consolidation RT patient advanced-stage DLBCL CHOP CHOP-like chemotherapy . The patient randomize among diagnose initially bulky disease ( &gt; 10 cm ) , achieve CR PR chemotherapy , even stage IV bone marrow involve . The complication relate consolidation RT also need additionally explore patient since efficacy advanced-stage DLBCL improve combined-modality therapy ( CMT ) . Especially , considerable difficulty continuous salvage option unavoidable risk blood cell production disorder associate extensive-field radiotherapy . Consolidation involved-field radiotherapy ( IFRT ) effective chemotherapy common palliative strategy patient advanced-stage DLBCL . The morbidity treatment may decrease RT radiation field size reduction . Involved-site radiotherapy ( ISRT ) , base modify involved field , aim reduce radiation volume treat probability late effect . Its radiation target include gross tumor volume ( GTV ) , clinical target volume ( CTV ) , plan target volume ( PTV ) , define International Commission Radiation Units Measurements Report ( ICRU ) 50 . This base defining site gross disease chemotherapy , GTV use CT-based volume expansion form CTV cranio-caudal direction . There clinical trial research whether sequential narrowed radiotherapy field size ( involved-site radiotherapy , ISRT ) obtain efficacy IFRT decrease toxicity relate radiotherapy . To evaluate difference IFRT ISRT efficacy complication related consolidation RT patient advanced-stage DLBCL achieve effective chemotherapy . The CTV ISRT define region include prechemotherapy volume disease 1.5 cm margin expand cranio-caudally direction potential lymphatic spread . The CTV extend air transverse plane limit involved lymph node region define Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) . The PTV extend CTV add necessary margin setup error organ motion .</detailed_description>
