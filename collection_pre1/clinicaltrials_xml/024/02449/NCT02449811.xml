	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , open-label , parallel-group study patient treatment-naive arterial hypertension characterize RAS peptide profile treatment initiation different antihypertensive drug-classes . Patients diagnose primary arterial hypertension require antihypertensive drug treatment well patient 4 week wash period ( Amendment 07/2016 ) recruit Medical Outpatient Clinic University Hospital Basel , Switzerland . Diagnostic work-up follow-up assessment treatment initiation 24 hour blood pressure measurement perform accord clinical practice guideline document altered study . Study mandate procedure randomization one four standard first-line treatment arm , blood sample RAS peptide profile drug concentration determination , non-invasive hemodynamic measurement . After provide write informed consent , patient randomize either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor- , angiotensin receptor blocker- , calcium channel blocker- hydrochlorothiazide-treatment arm . Drug treatment follow current guideline issue European Society Hypertension . According clinical practice , treatment-naive patient grade I grade II hypertension directly start intermediate dose monotherapy ( treatment period 1 ) . Treatment period 1 : 4 week intermediate dose monotherapy angiotensin-converting enzyme Inhibitor perindopril OR angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan OR calcium channel blocker amlodipine OR hydrochlorothiazide In patient reach blood pressure target accord 2013 ESH guideline management arterial hypertension 4 week , dose monotherapy drug double ( high dose , treatment period 2 ) , follow current guideline Treatment period 2 : 4 week high dose monotherapy angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril OR angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan OR calcium channel blocker amlodipine OR hydrochlorothiazide 80 patient ( 20 patient per treatment arm ) include sample analysis RAS peptide profile do treatment initiation ( baseline ) . Sampling analysis RAS peptide profile measurement drug concentration plasma do 4 week treatment period 0h ( last drug intake ) 4 hour last drug intake treatment period . Dropouts replace . Non-invasive hemodynamic measurement do time point determination RAS peptide profile drug concentration . A control group 20 age- gender-matched , healthy normotensive subject recruit establish characteristic RAS peptide profile comparable normotensive population . After provide write informed consent , normal blood pressure document 24h blood pressure measurement . In normotensive control group , blood sample determination RAS peptide profile well hemodynamic measurement do single day , time day hypertensive patient .
