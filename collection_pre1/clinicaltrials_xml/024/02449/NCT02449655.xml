	<brief_summary>Phase II trial AZD5363 plus paclitaxel / AZD2014 plus paclitaxel biomarker negative ( PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET ) advance gastric adenocarcinoma patient second-line chemotherapy . Each arm compose 25 patient . AZD5363 400mg bid 4 day on/ 3 day 7 day cycle week paclitaxel give + paclitaxel 80mg/m2 give day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle . AZD5363 paclitaxel receive 3 consecutive week , follow one week off-therapy 4-week cycles.If paclitaxel therapy stop AZD5363 give 4on/3off continuous schedule . AZD2014 50mg BD 3 day 4 day 7 day cycle + paclitaxel 80mg/m2 give day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle . Tumour evaluation use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 conduct screening ( within 28 day prior first dose ) every 8 week relative date first dose , week 40 , every 16 week objective disease progression ( within window +/- 7 day schedule date ) . Study treatment continue objective disease progression . The purpose study investigate safety efficacy AZD5363 plus paclitaxel biomarker negative ( PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET ) advance gastric adenocarcinoma patient second-line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AZD2014 selective dual mTOR kinase inhibitor target mTORC1 ( rapamycin sensitive ) mTORC2 ( rapamycin insensitive ) complex mammalian Target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) . AZD2014 selective dual mTOR kinase inhibitor target mTORC1 ( rapamycin sensitive ) mTORC2 ( rapamycin insensitive ) complex mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) AZD2014 specific mTOR inhibit member PI3K superfamily . The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway function sensor mitogen , energy nutrient level central controller cell growth . The mTOR protein kinase ( PK ) vital component PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway . This pathway deregulate 50 % human cancer , , important target inhibitor would alleviate unregulated proliferation cancer cell . AZD2014 selective inhibitor mTOR kinases inhibits signal mTOR complex , mTORC1 mTORC2 . In study , researcher investigate effect PI3K/mTOR inhibitor paclitaxel sensitizer and/or nonspecific target therapy combination standard chemotherapy , paclitaxel patient pretreated advanced metastatic gastric cancer negative biomarkers ( PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET ) . AZD5363 highly potent adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -competitive AKT inhibitor IC50 &lt; 10nmol/l three AKT isoforms . AZD5363 highly potent adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -competitive AKT inhibitor IC50 &lt; 10nmol/l three AKT isoforms . AKT pathway activate various human cancers.Although AKT inhibitor know show anti-tumor activity cell line mutate E542 , E545 , H1047 position preclinical study , clinical study AKT inhibitor conduct non-selected cancer patient .</detailed_description>
