	<detailed_description>For subject participate open-label extension study , last Extension Phase Visit ( EPV ) double-blind study also day Visit 1 study . At visit , subject ask willing continue open-label extension receive treatment Eslicarbazepine acetate ( ESL ) additional 2 year . In case marketing authorization ( MA ) ESL monotherapy achieve prior end 2017 , study may discontinue prematurely within 42 day achievement MA . For subject willing enter extension study , IMP double-blind study ( CBZ-CR ESL ) discontinue accord down-titration scheme clinical study protocol commercially available antiepileptic drug ( AED ) introduce accord investigator ` discretion . In case subject willing enter extension study , subject already treat ESL continue last evaluated dose ( ESL 800 mg , 1200 mg 1600 mg QD ) . Subjects previously treat CBZ-CR start ESL 400 mg QD one week follow up-titration ESL target dose equivalent last evaluate CBZ-CR dose level ( i.e . CBZ-CR 200 mg BID - &gt; ESL 800 mg QD ; CBZ-CR 400 mg BID - &gt; ESL 1200 mg QD ; CBZ-CR 600 mg BID - &gt; ESL 1600 mg QD ) step 400 mg dose increase per week . All subject previously treat CBZ-CR , regardless last evaluate dose level , start CBZ-CR down-titration two week first receipt ESL treatment part double-blind study outline BIA-2093-311 study protocol . In case new seizure , ESL dose increase maximum dose ESL 1600 mg QD [ dose level C ] , depend investigator ` decision . Any up-titration performed weekly step 400 mg . If accord investigator ` opinion subject may benefit combination treatment , additional commercially available AED add-on introduce investigator 's discretion . If deem necessary investigator , e.g . due occurrence adverse event , dose ESL reduce accord investigator 's discretion , long dose remain range 800 mg QD 1600mg QD .
