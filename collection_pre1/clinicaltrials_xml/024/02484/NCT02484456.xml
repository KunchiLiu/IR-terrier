	<brief_summary>Background : - Drugs talk therapy help treat depression , treatment usually take quite bit time work . Ketamine fast-acting antidepressant , side effect like unusual dream experience . The drug AV-101 may antidepressant effect few side effect . Researchers want see effective safe people major depressive disorder . Objective : - To see drug , AV-101 safe treat symptoms major depressive disorder . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 65 major depression without psychotic feature . Design : - Participants screen separate protocol . - Participants stay hospital 12 14 week . - Phase 1 ( 2 7 week ) : participant stop take medicine take 2 week . They several scan procedure . - Phase 2 ( 6 7 week ) : 2 week study drug placebo day , 2 week drug . - Participants : - Physical exam - Interviews - Frequent blood collection . A needle place small plastic tube arm . Some blood sample take tube . - 2 spinal tap ( optional ) . The back numbed . A needle insert catheter back bone . That leave 30 hour . Spinal fluid collect . - 5 scan . Participants lie machine magnetic field . The machine take picture brain brain chemical . - At end study , participant medical evaluation , question , blood test . Some may continue treatment clinic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antidepressant Effects Glycine Receptor Antagonist AV-101 ( 4-chlorokynurenine ) Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Modulation NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) complex component glutamatergic signal likely involve improvement depressive symptom related constructs/dimensions observable behavior neurobiological measure . Current standard monoaminergic pharmacological approach major depressive disorder ( MDD ) proven modestly effective acute depressive episode . We systematically test different glutamatergic modulators patient mood disorder order develop improve therapeutic . We find NMDAR antagonist ketamine produce rapid antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant depression ( MDD Bipolar Disorder ) . However , despite highly efficacious , proof concept ketamine produce psychotomimetic effect . In present protocol , aim evaluate new glutamate-mediated mechanism associate antidepressant efficacy target glycine receptor within NMDA receptor . Targeting glycine co-agonist site ( NMDA ) receptor may bypass potential adverse effect occur ketamine without affect robust efficacy observe . This may result glutamate surge associate rapid act antidepressant effect ketamine . The present Phase 2 proof-of-concept study design evaluate antidepressant effect AV 101 ( L-4-chlorokynurenine 4-Cl- KYN ) MDD ; synthetic compound enzymatically convert selective glycine/NMDAR antagonist 7-chlorokynurine ( 7-Cl-KYNA ) cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) reach brain glial cell . In animal model depression , 4-Cl-KYNA ( AV 101 ) induce acute prolonged antidepressant-like effect without exhibit ketamine-like side effect determine drug discrimination , condition place preference , pre-pulse inhibition test . We also evaluate neurobiological mechanism involve antidepressant response AV 101 . We expect effect may modulate glutamate transmission reverse clinical symptom depression . The demonstration glycine-antagonist produce antidepressant effect without psychotomimetic side effect would support therapeutic relevance glycine site NMDAR could direct development novel drug target treatment depression . Study Population Twenty-five individual treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) include . Design Male female patient , age 18 65 year , diagnosis MDD , currently episode major depression , recruit study . This study consist randomize , double-blind crossover administration either glycine receptor antagonist AV 101 ( 1,080 1,440 mg/day give orally ) placebo 2 week . The study ass efficacy improve overall depressive symptomatology tolerability AV 101 treatment-resistant MDD . Other aim study include : 1 ) determine whether change brain neurochemical ( e.g . glutamate ) peripheral biomarkers obtain via MRS cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) correlate antidepressant response ( decrease Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) total score ) AV 101 patient treatment-resistant MDD , 2 ) examine potential biomarkers response . Outcome Measures Primary : Hamilton Rating Scale ( HDRS ) total score . Secondary : Proportion subject achieve remission ( HDRS less great 7 ) response ( great equal 50 % reduction baseline HDRS total score ) ; change baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) total score . Surrogate biomarkers drug effect/response include : change prefrontal glutamate level measure 7T H-MRS .</detailed_description>
