	<brief_summary>The USP8 gene downstream target , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , potential therapeutic target Cushing disease . The EGFR inhibitor , Gefitinib , show reduce production ACTH vitro vivo , especially USP8-mutated corticotrophin adenoma . The investigator hypothesize Gefitinib suppress pituitary corticotroph tumor ACTH production normalize urinary free cortisol level patient USP8-mutated Cushing 's disease . Gefitinib FDA approve drug use treat non-small cell lung cancer . However , study , drug use treat corticotrophin adenoma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 year great Patients confirm diagnosis ACTHdependent Cushing 's disease evidence Mean urinary free cortisol four 24hour urine sample collect within 2 week , least 1.5 time upper limit laboratory normal range Morning plasma ACTH within normal normal range Either MRI confirmation pituitary macroadenoma ( great equal 1 cm ) , inferior petrosal sinus gradient &gt; 3 CRH stimulation patient microadenoma ( tumor le 1 cm ) * , patient prior pituitary surgery , histopathology confirm ACTH stain adenoma . IPSS previously perform without CRH ( e.g.with DDAVP ) , central peripheral prestimulation gradient &gt; 2 require . If IPSS previously perform , IPSS CRH stimulation require . Patients de novo Cushing 's disease include consider candidate pituitary surgery ( e.g . poor surgical candidate , surgically unapproachable tumor , patient refuse surgical treatment ) Confirmatory test prior IPSS ( lowdose dexamethasone suppression test dexamethasoneCRH test ) perform patient UFC ≤ 3.0 X ULN pituitary microadenoma order exclude possible pseudoCushing 's syndrome . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 ( i.e . require occasional assistance , able care personal need ) For patient medical treatment Cushing 's disease follow washout period must complete baseline efficacy assessment perform Inhibitors steroidogenesis ( ketoconazole , metyrapone , rosiglitazone ) : 1 week Dopamine agonist ( bromocriptine , cabergoline ) : 4 week Octreotide LAR Lanreotide autogel : 8 week Lanreotide SR : 4 week Octreotide ( immediate release formulation ) : 1 week Patients know history impaired fasting glucose DM may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary Patients receive pituitary irradiation within last ten year prior visit 1 , onset time radiation effect determine Patients treat mitotane last 6 month prior Visit 1 Patients compression optic chiasm cause visual field defect , order exclude patient tumor cause chiasma compression require surgery Patients Cushing 's syndrome due ectopic ACTH secretion Patients hypercortisolism secondary adrenal tumor nodular ( primary ) bilateral adrenal hyperplasia Patients know inherited syndrome cause hormone secretion ( i.e . Carney Complex , McCuneAlbright syndrome , MEN1 ) Patients diagnosis glucocorticoidremedial aldosteronism ( GRA ) Patients hypothyroid adequate replacement therapy Patients undergone major surgery within 1 month prior start study Patients symptomatic cholelithiasis Diabetic patient antidiabetic medication whose fast blood glucose poorly control evidence HbA1C &gt; 8 % Patients abnormal coagulation ( PT PTT elevate 30 % normal limit ) Patients receive anticoagulant affect PT PTT Patients congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina , sustain ventricular tachycardia , clinically significant bradycardia , advanced heart block , history acute MI le one year prior study entry clinically significant impairment cardiovascular function Patients risk factor torsade de pointes , i.e . patient baseline QTc &gt; 480 m , hypokalemia , family history long QT syndrome , concomitant medication know prolong QT interval Patients liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis , chronic persistent hepatitis , patient ALT/AST 2 X ULN , serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 X ULN , serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 X ULN , serum albumin &lt; 0.67 X LLN Patients WBC &lt; 3 X 109/L ; Hgb &lt; LLN ; PLT &lt; 100 X 109/L Patients current prior medical condition interfere conduct study evaluation result opinion investigator sponsor 's medical monitor Female patient pregnant lactating , childbearing potential practicing medically acceptable method birth control . Female patient must use barrier contraception condom . If oral contraception use , patient must practice method least two month prior enrollment must agree continue oral contraceptive throughout course study one month last dose study drug . Male patient sexually active require use condom study 1 month afterwards History immunocompromise , include positive HIV test result ( Elisa Western blot ) . An HIV test require , however , previous medical history review Patients history alcohol drug abuse 6 month period prior receive pasireotide Patients give blood donation ( 400 ml ) within 2 month receive gefitinib Patients participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 1 month prior dose patient previously treat gefitinib Known hypersensitivity gefitinib Patients active malignant disease within last five year ( exception basal cell carcinoma carcinoma situ cervix ) Patients presence active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable unable complete entire study</criteria>
