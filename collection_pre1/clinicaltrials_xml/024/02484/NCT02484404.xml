Design : - Phase I : MEDI+O , MEDI+C MEDI+O+C dose escalate simultaneously . MEDI4736 administer every 2 week every 4 week disease progression . O tablets C give orally continuous intermittent dose schedule . The DLT period one cycle , 28 day . Patients 2-week schedule great one year change 4-week schedule progression . - MEDI+O : MEDI4736 ( 3 mg/kg 10 mg/kg IV every 2 week , fix dose 1500 mg every 4 week ) O tablet ( 150 mg 200 mg 300 mg BID ) - MEDI+C : MEDI4736 ( 3 mg/kg 10 mg/kg IV every 2 week , fix dose 1500 mg every 4 week ) C ( 15 mg 20 mg 30 mg daily 5 days/week ) - MEDI+O+C : MEDI4736 ( fix dose 1500mg every 4 week ) O tablet ( 200 mg 300 mg BID ) C ( 15 mg 20 mg 5 days/week ) - Phase II MEDI+O : Patients Cohorts 1-5 treated MEDI+O RP2D ( O 300mg tablet bid daily MEDI4736 1500mg IV every 4 week ) . - Phase II MEDI+C : Patients Cohorts 1-3 treated MEDI+C RP2D . ( C 20mg day [ 5 day on/2 day ] MEDI4736 1500 mg every 4 week ) . - Phase II Correlative study : Research sample include whole blood , CTCs , cell free DNA plasma obtain pretreatment , prior cycle 1 day 15 , prior cycle 3 day 1 progression . Mandatory baseline core biopsy two optional biopsy obtain . - Patients evaluated toxicity every 4 week CTCAEv4.0 , response every two cycle ( 8 week ) RECIST 1.1 . Patients mCRPC ( MEDI+O Cohort 4 ) evaluate response initially 8 week every 12 week use RECIST v1.1 criterion per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) .</detailed_description>
