	<detailed_description>Background objective : India home 358 million young people age group 10 24Í¾ 243 million 10 19 year age . This represent huge opportunity transform social economic fortune country . Key public health challenge adolescent India include unwanted pregnancy , sexually transmit reproductive tract infection , injury , grow misuse alcohol , tobacco substance , mental health problem depression , anxiety disorder suicide . Schools provide ideal platform address health issue WHO 's Health Promoting Schools framework seek address structural determinant health concern . The recent Cochrane review assess school-based intervention find 'whole school ' 'school environment ' intervention effective address range health outcome among adolescent include bullying , aggression , tobacco use . However , comparable evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness school-based health promotion program India . SEHER-Strengthening Evidence base school-based intErventions pRomoting adolescent health , jointly fund programme ( The MacArthur Foundation United Nation 's Population Development Fund , India ) seek develop evaluate comprehensive adolescent health promotion intervention deliver two different delivery agent viz . teacher SEHER Mitra ( TSM ) lay health worker call SEHER Mitra ( SM ) government run secondary school Bihar , India . Hypotheses : 1 . For primary outcome measure : It hypothesize intervention strategy addition usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) grade effect overall school climate . 2 . For secondary outcome measure : The intervention build positive attitude towards gender equity , build knowledge attitude towards reproductive sexual health , reduce self-reported bullying , violence depression . 3 . For exploratory outcome measure : The intervention decrease tobacco , alcohol substance use , reduce suicide behaviour ( suicide thought attempt ) increase safe sexual behaviour . An addition SEHER intervention already exist Tarang-AEP enhance effect mention outcome ; low resource intensity intervention ( Teacher-as-SEHER Mitra : Arm-I ) minimal moderate effect , high resource intensity intervention ( School Mitra : Arm-II ) great significant effect . Randomisation : The school unit randomisation allocate one intervention arm comparison use minimisation pilot study ( June 2014-March 2015 ) . Although , usually pilot study would conduct different school main trial , possible SEHER conduct pilot study main trial school new cohort standard IX student enter school every year . Before randomisation , list eligible school randomisation ( n=112 ) total number secondary high secondary school Nalanda district Bihar ( n=136 ) generate . The following criterion use generate list : implementation Tarang-AEP programme , total number student school , total number employ teacher school . Of 112 school , 75 randomly select random allocation . To representative pool 75 school , ensure equal number school type three trial arm , 68 % co-educational ( 63 93 ) , 69 % girl ' ( 9 13 ) 50 % boy ' school ( 3 6 ) select . All 75 school allocate comparison one intervention arm use minimization . To carry allocation minimisation , arm balance follow variable ( variable classify category ) : 1 . Type school ( secondary= 1 ; secondary high secondary school= 2 ) ; 2 . School size ( small=100-300 ; medium=301-600 , large=601 student ) , 3 . Nature school ( Co-education=1 ; boys'=2 ; girl ' =3 ) . The random allocation use minimization carry independent statistician ( Gian Luca DiTanna , LSHTM ) use R software package . Sample size : The sample size estimation base various scenario change primary two secondary outcome measure , viz . overall school climate , self-reported bullying experience , prevalence moderate severe depression , respectively . The baseline average score prevalence rate/proportion outcome indicator respective intra-class coefficient ( ICCs ) base data collect pilot test SEHER outcome assessment questionnaire 15 school ( 5 school arm ; N=1722 participant ) . - The arithmetic mean score Beyond Blue School Climate scale 20.7 ( SD 6.7 ) ICC 0.018 . The minimum maximum score 28 item scale range 0 28 , high score indicate favourable experience School Climate . - 18 % student secondary school Nalanda , Bihar report experience bully last 30 day ( In last 30 day , I make fun sexual joke , comment , gesture school ) ICC 0.03 - The arithmetic mean score Primary Health Questionnaire -9 ( PHQ-9 ) 6.12 ( SD 5.04 ) ICC 0.0001 - The cluster number 25 per arm average cluster size 200 ( average classroom size standard IX school Nalanda district 70 student average 3 division school ) - Assumed 15 % loss follow-up Based assumption , propose trial 98 % power detect effect size 0.2 ( difference means/SD ) average school climate score comparison intervention arm , 95 % confidence ICC 0.02 ( 88 % power among boys 93 % among girl respectively ) . The trial 83 % power detect 6 % absolute difference proportion student report experience bully comparison intervention arm , 95 % confidence ICC 0.03 ( 82 % power detect 7 % difference boys 83 % power 6 % difference girl respectively ) . Likewise , trial least 93 % power detect effect size 0.1 depression score overall , 95 % confidence ICC 0.0001 ( 88 % power among boy ICC 0.03 92 % among girls ICC 0.005 respectively ) . Process Evaluation : Process evaluation integral part research design examine quality programme implementation ( i.e . integrity fidelity ) , completeness delivery , extent stakeholder engage . In , help explain programme 's outcome identify way improve and/or replicate . Two type indicator collate evaluate fidelity delivery SEHER intervention , viz . quantity quality . Data management : Two type quantitative data collect : intervention process , outcome assessment . All outcome assessment data collect paper form , process data TSMs/SMs . All data manually entered Access database . Range consistency check perform monthly interval process data . Queries identify resolve promptly trial management team , database update , maintain audit trail . All data keep separate database merge master database data collection complete individual database lock . All process data backed-up external hard disk monthly basis . Access pre-locked data password protect multiple level member trial team apart data manager independent statistician access password . After dataset lock , dataset remain password-protected trial investigator access datasets . For data , separate file link name trial identification code keep password protect . Analysis : Quantitative analysis carry use STATA ( version 13 ) . Below summary approach analysis . A detailed analysis plan agree Data Safety Monitoring Board towards end trial and/or analysis undertaken . Descriptive analysis : Initial analysis compare characteristic enrol participant within across arm ( example : age socioeconomic background ) .An initial stage statistical analysis also involve examine balance characteristic within across three arm outcome measure use SEHER study . The outcome measure summarise baseline follow-up cluster , arm-wise overall . These summarise mean ( SD ) , median ( Inter-Quartile Range ) number proportion appropriate key relevant subgroup ( age , gender , baseline outcome score ) . For continuous outcome , histogram also plot within arm ass normality , whether transformation require . Outcome analysis : The primary analysis , base repeat cross sectional survey , intention-to-treat end trial use multi-level model take account cluster school level . The sub-group analysis involve gender-wise well analyse student least 60 % attendance academic year . The trial outcomes evaluate primary secondary outcome base change intervention arm compare change comparison relative `` baseline '' . The primary trial impact comparison analyse baseline assessment 6-7 month follow-up assessment . Mixed effect regression perform analyse change primary secondary outcomes school-level . The multilevel analyse contain two level : school level individual student level . Effect size present risk ratio binary outcome ( e.g . experience bullying ) , mean difference continuous outcome ( e.g . overall school climate score ) ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) derive . The reporting presentation trial accordance CONSORT guideline cluster randomise trial , primary comparative analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis .</detailed_description>
