	<detailed_description>Despite laudable reduction global childhood mortality rate , pneumonia remain second frequent killer child less five year old worldwide . Nearly one million child succumb pneumonia 2013 , great half death Africa . In Malawi , high prevalence malnutrition Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection , pneumonia major cause pediatric mortality . In patient World Health Organization ( WHO ) -defined severe pneumonia , malnutrition , HIV-infection , hypoxemia primary driver poor outcome . In recent analysis 2001-2012 child pneumonia outcomes Malawi overall case fatality rate decrease 15 % 4 % except child severe malnutrition . The pneumonia mortality rate malnourish child remain elevated 15 % despite antibiotic increase access supportive intervention like low-flow supplemental oxygen . In Malawian child HIV-infection , WHO severe pneumonia severe malnutrition strong predictor death . Severe hypoxemic pneumonia may common child HIV-affected severely malnourished case , may also high mortality non HIV-affected , non-severely malnourished case without severe hypoxemia . Non-invasive ventilation , already routinely use industrialised country , may provide advanced treatment solution certain patient population child WHO severe pneumonia complicate severe malnutrition and/or HIV-infection -exposure severe hypoxemia . Bubble continuous positive airway pressure ( bCPAP ) non-invasive widely use preterm neonatal respiratory failure industrialised country . Along flow generator , bCPAP us water column deliver continuous positive pressure spontaneously breathe child . bCPAP relatively inexpensive require little technical expertise compare mechanical ventilation , limited experience bCPAP resource-poor setting . Recently , small study explore use preterm neonate Malawi . However , study describe use old infant child , none include mortality primary endpoint specially focus main driver poor pediatric pneumonia outcome southern Africa , HIV , malnutrition , hypoxemia . The investigator data use bCPAP Malawian child severe pneumonia suggest feasibility implementation . The investigator previously report use bCPAP system derive locally available , relatively inexpensive supply show promise management hospitalize HIV-infected child pneumonia Malawi . The investigator observational case series delineate outcomes 77 Malawian child hospitalize tertiary referral facility severe pneumonia treat bCPAP . Nearly half infant either infect expose HIV severely malnourish . Although mortality series patient 50.0 % , bCPAP initiate cohort patient find fail standard treatment . The investigator estimate 75 % child would eligible mechanical ventilation . In proposed study investigator initiate bCPAP early hospitalization prior treatment failure . Unlike previous study conduct referral hospital , investigator perform study district hospital level 80 % hospitalize child pneumonia case care Malawi . Although bCPAP relatively inexpensive , scale-up country like Malawi significant pneumonia burden high HIV prevalence require substantial resource meet expect need . In order appropriately allocate precious resource provide practical clinical guidance healthcare provider may use bCPAP , paramount fully understand utility bCPAP treatment set . To investigator knowledge bCPAP data use control group mortality primary outcome reporting similar generalize HIV epidemic African patient population 1-59 month age . Data generate research additionally critical formulating future study may include bCPAP refinement exploration feasible modality like high-flow nasal cannula bi-level positive airway pressure . Therefore , rigorous methodology propose warrant support Malawi Ministry Health . If bCPAP prof effective treatment modality child hospitalize WHO severe pneumonia , simple technology could operationalized help thousand child life-threatening pneumonia . The investigator propose address critical evidence gap conduct randomize control study determine bCPAP outcome , compare currently recommend standard care endorse WHO Malawi Ministry Health , hospitalize Malawian child WHO-defined severe pneumonia complicate malnutrition and/or HIV-infection -exposure , severe hypoxemia . RATIONALE Quality randomize study compare bCPAP versus standard-of-care control group include low-flow oxygen therapy use primary endpoint mortality available low-resource setting include high prevalence HIV country like Malawi child 1-59 month age severe pneumonia . Demonstrating mortality benefit bCPAP need support investment scale bCPAP care old Malawian child 1-59 month age World Health Organization ( WHO ) severe pneumonia complicate HIV and/or malnutrition , severe hypoxemia . STUDY HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES • Study Hypotheses The investigator hypothesize bCPAP , compare standard care , reduce mortality Malawian child WHO-defined severe pneumonia complicate severe co-morbidity ( HIV-infection HIV-exposure and/or severe malnutrition ) , severe hypoxemia without severe co-morbidity . • Study Objectives The broad objective study provide scientific evidence assess effectiveness treatment bCPAP WHO severe childhood pneumonia child 1-59 month age Malawi , Africa . - Primary Objective 1 • Determine pneumonia mortality rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , child WHO severe pneumonia . - Primary Objective 2 • Determine pneumonia mortality rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , child WHO severe hypoxemic pneumonia without co-morbidity ( i.e. , HIV infection , HIV-exposure , severe malnutrition ) . - Primary Objective 3 • Determine pneumonia mortality rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , child WHO severe pneumonia co-morbidity ( i.e. , HIV-infection HIV-exposure and/or severe malnutrition ) . - Secondary Objectives - Determine pneumonia day 6 treatment failure rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , HIV-infected child WHO severe pneumonia . - Determine pneumonia day 6 treatment failure rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , HIV-exposed , uninfected child WHO severe pneumonia . - Determine pneumonia day 6 treatment failure rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , severely malnourished child WHO severe pneumonia . - Determine pneumonia day 6 treatment failure rate bCPAP treatment , compare standard care , severely hypoxemic child WHO severe pneumonia . - Determine proportion child alive day 30 phone follow . - To investigate whether may differential treatment response child severe anemia , test positive malaria , wheeze baseline , whether differential treatment response age . - To determine whether intervention arm equivalent rate adverse event control arm .</detailed_description>
