	<brief_summary>1 . Many patient type 2 diabetes glycaemic goal require additional therapy order reduce vascular risk improve symptom control 2 . Sulphonylurea therapy commonly prescribe 2nd-line glucose -lowering agent use recommend major clinical guideline diabetes also recently present IDF ( International Diabetes Federation ) guideline old people . 3 . Older people diabetes homogeneous group many 25 % frail . 4 . Frailty PRE-DISABILITY state may increase 'vulnerability ' many old people fall , admission hospital , perhaps increase risk hypoglycaemia 5 . As consequence glucose-lowering ability , sulphonylureas may increase risk hypoglycaemia old people feature frailty may increase risk . 6 . The investigator therefore need estimate risk hypoglycaemia moderately frail old subject type 2 diabetes take sulphonylurea therapy commonly prescribe class agent use routinely clinical practice 7 . Thus , short term project wish assess frequency hypoglycaemia subject evidence frailty type 2 diabetes series glucose monitor technique excellent research team support minimize safety issue . An identical study Second University Naples , Italy supervision Professor Giuseppe Paolisso plan second study site PILOT project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DiaFrail : A Short Duration Study Older People ( DIAFRAIL Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Study The rate hypoglycaemia old people diabetes known accuracy data old frail patient diabetes . However , latter group increasingly recognize specific subgroup patient diabetes important ass safe sulphonylurea agent old patient group glucose-lowering medication recommend diabetes clinical guideline include algorithm . The data rate mild moderate hypoglycemia old people diabetes also scant many episode may asymptomatic , take place without either patient family knowing , thus important information nature reach clinician charge prescribe . In latter circumstance , continuous blood glucose monitoring ( CBGM ) important role detect frequency episode use subgroup treatment arm PILOT study . When hypoglycaemic episode accompany symptom , detection rate obviously improve . It important note even mild symptomatic hypoglycemia may associate increase cardiovascular event , increased hospitalisation increase mortality although study young 'elderly ' group ( average age 63y ) , There thus important need ass risk whether commonly use sulphonylureas relatively safe respect . As metformin sulphonylureas still commonest agent use low glucose level people diabetes , investigator wish study first programme study area . With development class oral glucose-lowering agent DPP4-inhibitors associate low level hypoglycaemia well tolerate old patient type 2 diabetes ( 5 ) , important provide justification use discover hypoglycaemia , subclinical/asymptomatic serious form hypoglycaemia occur commonly sulphonylurea treatment . The data rate mild moderate hypoglycemia old people diabetes even scant - symptomatic , detection rate improve , asymptomatic , detection require CBGM . In young 'elderly ' group ( average age 63y ) , even mild symptomatic hypoglycemia may associate increase cardiovascular event , increased hospitalisation increase mortality Therefore , primary object short PILOT hypoglycemia rate-determining study evaluation difference ( % variation mild-moderate hypoglycemic event ) glimepiride ( 2-4mg twice daily ) add metformin , metformin treatment alone ( maximal dose ( 1500 mg/day ) , mild moderately frail old type 2 diabetic patient age 70 year . The investigator wish observe whether intervention group change HbA1c level treatment period glimepiride .</detailed_description>
