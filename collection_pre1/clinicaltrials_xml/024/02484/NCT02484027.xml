	<brief_summary>This study randomize , open-lable , parallel-group comparator-controlled . 456 consecutive patient acute ischemic stroke admit within first 72 hour onset symptom study . Those patient randomly assign receive 2 different treatment first 3 day hospitalization ( non-statin-therapy group ) immediately receive rosuvastatin orally dose 20mg daily ( statin-therapy group ) . From fourth day onward , rosuvastatin 10 mg daily administer patient . The total trial continue 12 month . mRS investigated baseline , 3rd month , 12th month ; MMSE Montreal test investigate baseline 12th month . Laboratory data include serum lipid , Fg hs-CRP.Among , serum lipid test baseline , 8th day , 3rd month , 6th month , 12th month ; hs-CRP test baseline 8th day , 3rd month ; Fg test baseline , 8th day , 3rd month . Safety also assess adverse event report clinical laboratory data include CK-MB , renal hepatic function 3rd month , 6th month,12th month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomize , open-lable , parallel-group comparator-controlled.456 consecutive patient anterior circulation ischemic stroke within 72h 2 participate hospital enrol study . Those patient randomly assign receive 2 different treatment first 3 day hospitalization ( non-statin-therapy group ) immediately receive rosuvastatin orally dose 20mg daily ( statin-therapy group ) . From fourth day onward , rosuvastatin 10 mg daily administer patient . The total trial continue 12 months.Subject eligibility establish treatment randomization . A random number table generate use computerized procedure subject randomize strictly sequentially eligible randomization . The randomization procedure do like . The random number divide 2 . And remainder 1 , subject assign intensive rosuvastatin group . Correspondingly , remainder 0 , subject assign non-rosuvastatin group . Subjects randomized 1:1 schedule . According previous post hoc analysis SPARCL analysis result , mRS event rate ( mRS &gt; 2 ) 90 day among statin-naïve patient admission 42 % without statin treatment first 3 day admission versus 28 % statin immediately use since admission . Previous study show benefit statin treatment earlier period acute ischemic stroke , data SPARCL reserve conservatively patient within 6 month stroke onset enrol . It base report event rate , sample size 182 patient per group 80 % power detect rate difference 14 % , assume null rate difference zero use Pearson 's chi-squared test two-sided significance level 0.05 . With estimate 20 % rate dropping study , total 456 patient randomize ( 228 group ) study . Medical history obtain subject enrollment . Patients follow 1 year . mRS investigated baseline , 3rd month , 12th month ; MMSE Montreal test investigate baseline 12th month . Laboratory data include serum lipid , Fg hs-CRP.Among , serum lipid test baseline , 8th day 3rd month , 6th month,12th month ; hs-CRP test baseline 8th day , 3rd month , Fg test baseline , 8th day , 3rd month . Safety also assess adverse event report clinical laboratory data include CK-MB , renal hepatic function 3rd month , 6th month,12th month . Primary endpoint proportion poor prognosis ( modified Rankin score &gt; 2 ) 3 12 month post discharge . mRS score &gt; 2 define poor prognosis . And mRS scores≤2 score define good prognosis . Primary endpoint comparison percentage poor prognosis two group . Second endpoint include change baseline serum lipid , Fg hs-CRP level 8th day , 3rd month , 6th month 12th month randomization . The incidence vascular endpoint event include all-cause mortality , event recurrent ischemic stroke/TIA , hemorrhagic stroke , myocardial infarction angina , noncerebral ischemia hemorrhage . And change admission MMSE Montreal score subject 12th month . Researchers responsible evaluation mRS , NIHSS score , MMSE Montreal score receive centralize training specialize . Specialized doctor follow-up subject knowledge statin therapy patient . Every month meeting hold know problem solve . Two special doctor center responsible follow-up visit . Patients ask bring empty package clinic visit . The patient 's compliance assess investigator record CRF . A pill count do patient level record CRF dispense log study site personnel .</detailed_description>
