	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128 Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete hematologic response ( CR ) /complete response complete response incomplete ( CRi ) rate MLN0128 ( TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128 ) administer adult patient relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate ( CR , CRi/partial response ( PR ) /morphologic leukemia free state [ MLFS ] ) . II . Determine CR/CRi duration MLN0128 administer adult patient relapsed/refractory ALL . III . Determine frequency proceed allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) patient relapsed/refractory ALL achieve response MLN0128 . IV . Determine overall survival relapsed/refractory ALL patient MLN0128 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine pharmacokinetics MLN0128 ALL patient . II . Assess whether phosphorylation mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) substrate 4EBP1 decrease leukemic blast harvest bone marrow day 8 compare baseline . III . Assess exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 enhance expression pro-apoptotic protein Bim Puma marrow ALL cell . IV . Assess exploratory fashion whether myeloid cell leukemia 1 ( Mcl-1 ) level decrease blast cell MLN0128 treatment . V. Assess exploratory fashion whether ) phospho-protein pattern baseline b ) MLN0128-associated change phospho-protein pattern differs ALL sample respond therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive MLN0128 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course response absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
