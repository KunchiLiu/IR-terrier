	<brief_title>The Risk Major Bleeding With Novel Anti-platelets : A Comparison Ticagrelor With Clopidogrel Real World Population 5000 Patients Treated Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major bleed myocardial infarction portend poor outcome . A balance require potency platelet inhibition risk bleeding . Ticagrelor provide faster effective platelet inhibition Clopidogrel . In PLATO trial Ticagrelor reduce incidence cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction stroke compare Clopidogrel ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ) . Although difference overall bleed non-CABG related major bleed Ticagrelor . It since recommend , addition aspirin , treatment moderate-high risk ACS ESC ( European Society Cardiology ) NICE ( National Institute Clinical Excellence ) . There widespread adoption first line therapy UK hospital . There remain potential concern bleed `` real world '' population compromise high risk patient ; particularly elderly female , PLATO . The investigator intend perform large `` real world '' comparison bleed risk Ticagrelor compare Clopidogrel UK ACS population . The investigator plan observational cohort study patient present ACS 5 district general hospital Merseyside Cheshire . The investigator collect data retrospectively 2500 patient treat Clopidogrel prior guideline change 2500 treat Ticagrelor thereafter . The primary end point incidence BARC 3-5 ( Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ) PLATO major bleeding .</detailed_description>
