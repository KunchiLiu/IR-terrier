	<brief_summary>Phase II open-label study evaluate efficacy safety Radium-223 dichloride combination external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) vs. external beam radiotherapy alone treatment advanced castration resistant prostate carcinoma limit bone metastasis . To evaluate time radiological progression accord `` Recommendations Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group '' publish Scher et al . ( JCO 2008 ) ( base new lesion bone scan CT /MRI death ) Radium-223 dichloride combine EBRT superior compare EBRT alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Advanced Castration Resistant Prostate Carcinoma With Limited Bone Metastases ( α-RT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This international , multi-center , open-label , prospective , phase II study design assess efficacy radiation therapy combination Radium-223 dichloride patient diagnose CRPC oligo metastases bone disease . All patient enrol study sign informed consent form ( ICF ) adhere inclusion exclusion criterion . During treatment period , patient follow ongoing basis safety quality life ( QoL ) . Safety assessment include collection AEs grade , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , adverse event ( AEs ) correspond symptom arise bone metastasis , laboratory value , ( WHO/ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) . Documentation date disease progression perform interval image method ( bone scan CR/MRI ) describe study protocol . Quality life measure patient assessment use validated questionnaire , Brief Pain Inventory Short Form ( BPI-SF ) , European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality life questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C15-PAL EORTC QLQ- Bone Metastases ( BM ) 22 . Follow-up assessment safety AEs SAEs , occurrence secondary malignancy conduct every 3-12 month patient dy study terminate sponsor . If patient long travel clinical site , follow survival , i.e. , long term follow-up phase study .</detailed_description>
