	<brief_title>A Gene Therapy Study Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophilia B , Christmas disease , genetic bleeding disorder result lack ability produce blood-clotting factor IX ( FIX ) . Individuals hemophilia B suffer repeat bleed event , cause chronic joint disease sometimes lead death due inability blood clot efficiently . This chronic joint disease significant physical , psychosocial , quality-of-life effect , include financial burden . The current treatment intravenous infusion FIX protein product , either prophylactically response bleeding . The approach test study us novel recombinant adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) , nature cause disease , deliver human factor IX ( hFIX ) gene liver cell FIX normally make . Recent data gene therapy study show preliminary encouraging result approach use AAV vector carry factor IX gene . This study seek determine safety kinetics single IV infusion SPK-9001 ( novel AAV vector carry high specific activity factor IX variant ) .</detailed_description>
