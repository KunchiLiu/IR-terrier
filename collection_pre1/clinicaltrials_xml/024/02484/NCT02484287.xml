	<brief_summary>The purpose and/or hypothesis : To decrease amount external ventricular drain ( EVD ) relate catheter infection compare efficacy Oklahoma University Medicine standard EVD catheter , impregnate non-impregnated , three principle area : incidence infection , cost analysis , average duration placement , maintain standard technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality Control : A Prospective Analysis EVD Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental design : Track external ventricular drain ( EVD ) associate infection quality prospective analysis compare usage standard catheter use department Oklahoma University , 1 ) 35cm Codman Bactiseal rifampin clindamycin impregnate catheter , 2 ) Ventriclear EVD Antibiotic Catheter , 3 ) 36 cm Integra Hermatic large style ventricular catheter , term incidence infection , cost , duration placement , difference placement technique . Proposed procedure : Monitor infection associate related EVD placement patient assess infection rate affect usage antibiotic impregnate EVD catheter . Importance knowledge reasonably expect result research : While use sterile technique periprocedural antibiotic traditionally use combat infection , infection rate remain goal lead question whether antibiotic impregnated catheter add standard care . With knowledge gain , investigator hope decrease amount external ventricular drain related catheter infection reduce use prolonged antibiotic .</detailed_description>
