	<brief_summary>Background : - Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) cause respiratory infection . Some life-threatening , especially young child , elderly , people weak immune system . Researchers want study RSV infection hospital set healthy adult . They want use learn test new treatment vaccines future . Objectives : - To study body respond RSV . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18-50 Design : - Participants screen another protocol . - Participants : - Medical history - Physical exam - EKG . Heart rhythm measure small sticky patch chest , arm , leg . - Chest x-ray - Pulmonary function test . This measure much air person move lung . - Blood urine test - Nasal wash and/or nasal swab . For wash , nose rinse sterile liquid . For swab , inside nostril rubbed cotton swab . - Participants two , possibly three , follow-up outpatient visit , approximately 1 , 2 6 month receive dose RSV . - Participants stay hospital isolation 7 day get virus . - The average stay 10 day . Participants leave isolation unit . They visitor . - The virus cause mild medium cold . - Participants fill symptom card every day hospital 1 month . - Participants 2 follow-up visit , 28 56 day leave hospital . - Female participant sexually active must remain abstinent use effective form birth control 1 month get virus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) lead cause pediatric low respiratory tract infection . RSV also cause low respiratory tract disease elderly life-threatening disease immunocompromised host . An RSV monoclonal antibody ( palivizumab ) currently available passive immunoprophylaxis high-risk infant . Vaccines antiviral agent development treatment prevention RSV , none license . The ability challenge healthy volunteer RSV could rapidly facilitate efficacy study future antiviral vaccine . In addition , challenge study would provide critical information viral pathogenesis , include type cell infect , mucosal systemic immune response , alteration respiratory microbiota . Clinical trial material human challenge study prepare live recombinant ( complementary DNA-derived ) RSV subgroup A ( RSV A2 ) . This study phase 1 study healthy adult male non-pregnant female subject 18 year 50 year age . The purpose trial define safety profile estimate illness rate subject give 2 different dos RSV A2 challenge virus . If RSV A2 find sufficiently infectious adult , may use challenge virus future study evaluate protective efficacy RSV vaccine antiviral study pathogenesis RSV . Subjects admit NIH Clinical Center receive single intranasal dose RSV A2 either 10^5 10^6.3 PFU . Subjects remain Clinical Center approximately 9-12 day clinical evaluation . Research procedure conduct blood nasal swab wash sample include lymphocyte phenotyping , cytokine analysis , transcriptosome profiling , RSV-specific immunoglobin analysis ( circulate IgG nasal secretory IgA ) , quantitative viral titer viral culture , nasal microbiome analysis . Subjects discharge NP wash RSV result negative two consecutive day sign symptom suggestive possible RSV-associated low respiratory tract disease . Subjects return followup evaluation 28 56 day viral challenge .</detailed_description>
