	<brief_summary>- To investigate whether cetuximab alone ( give progression cumulative toxicity ) 8 cycle FOLFIRI + cetuximab result non inferior Progression Free Survival compare continuous FOLFIRI + cetuximab ( give progression cumulative toxicity ) . - To assess whether improvement incidence grade 3-4 hematological non-hematological adverse event ( AEs ) achieve experimental arm ( cetuximab alone 8 cycle FOLFIRI + cetuximab ) compare continuous chemotherapy arm ( FOLFIRI plus cetuximab ) - To explore possibility use liquid biopsy molecular profile well monitor treatment activity mCRC pt receive cetuximab base therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Survival patient undergo therapy FOLFIRI + cetuximab seem related ability treatment induce rapid reduction tumor mass . In retrospective analysis FIRE-3 trial ETS significantly associate PFS OS , suggest ETS reflect existence select population patient highly sensitive cetuximab . This permit assumption , goal achieve , exposure combine antineoplastic treatment ( cytotoxic drug target therapy ) may result improvement preservation result , increase side effect additional unavoidable disease progression . In addition , heavy exposure cytotoxic antineoplastic treatment may lead bone marrow toxicity , hepatic renal function decrease could compromise sequential treatment plan , negatively affect OS . With availability effective treatment cetuximab monotherapy4 without major side effect blood count liver kidney function , use treatment alone achievement deep clinical response could viable strategy achieve good control disease , limit side effect . As show several study design understand effective treatment sequence colorectal carcinoma , important factor influence overall survival possibility administer line effective therapy . As consequence , de-intensifying strategy subgroup highly select RAS BRAF WT population might segregate group patient large potential fast-primary treatment . Joining best induction treatment expression patient capability undergo additional line antineoplastic therapy may way optimize continuum care . Recently , several mechanism resistance anti-EGFR therapy describe , none may use early order support treatment choice.Moreover , assessment secondary resistance require tissue sample often really feasible . Therefore , prospective multiple gene mutation analysis could meet need characterize primary resistance , whereas liquid biopsy might help recognize resistance occur early treatment mean simple repeatable assay . Based consideration , investigator design strategy study : phase III randomize two arm study FOLFIRI + cetuximab disease progression compare FOLFIRI + cetuximab 8 cycle follow cetuximab alone disease progression first line treatment patient RAS BRAF WT metastatic colorectal cancer combine prospective multiple gene mutation analysis tumor tissue blood .</detailed_description>
