	<brief_summary>The study purpose determine whether two different hemodialysis blood flow rate meet national dialysis standard urea clearance . Urea use primary marker dialysis adequacy . It experimental study crossover design minimum 38 participant . Participants select accessible pool end-stage renal disease client Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit . The participant dialyse pre-determined blood flow rate ( 320 mL/min 380 mL/min ) two week . Two form urea clearance data collect : one value routinely calculated dialysis machine record client treatment log , another calculated lab blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design This quasi-experimental study involve independent variable blood flow rate ( Qb ) , measure mL/min , dependent variable dialysis clearance , measure Kt/V URR ( urea reduction ratio ) . Control randomization manifest crossover design , provide benefit separate treatment effect period effect ( Wellek &amp; Blettner , 2012 ) . Participants randomly assign - way select name envelope - one two group : A , dialyse first 320 mL/min ; B , 380 mL/min . Each study period consist two week ( 6 session , 24 hour dialysis ) Qb . Because urea clearance immediate , six treatment Qb reflect accurate data Kt/V URR ( Dr. John Duncan , 2014 , personal communication ) . Although carryover effect concern study participant routinely dialyse three time per week , wherein urea level naturally rise routine treatment , washout phase one week study period occur , recommend effective crossover design ( Wellek &amp; Blettner , 2012 ) . Sample The target sample population end-stage renal disease patient dialyse arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit . Power analysis conduct Centre Health Evaluation Outcome Sciences ( CHEOS ) . To ensure Kt/V 1.3 URR 70 % estimate confidence interval 95 % , minimum sample size 34 participant require . An additional 10 % necessary account attrition . Because randomization occur study period assignment , purposive sampling use select participant accessible pool ( estimate 60 patient ) , 38 participant identify . The inclusion criterion : Dialysing great six month ensure access patency , viability , stability ; Undergoing thrice weekly , four-hour dialysis session uniform dialysis duration ; Dialysing AVF , either brachio-cephalic radio-cephalic ; central venous catheter , arteriovenous graft , femoral AVFs due difference access flow vessel quality ; BLOOD FLOW RATE 5 Dialysing 15g needle organization policy restrict great flow rate small needle gauge ; Dialysing dialysate flow ( Qd ) 500 mL/min reduce possibility clearance attributable difference Qd ; Maintaining transonic vascular access flow &gt; 600 mL/min past 6 month , per KDOQI ( NKF , 2006 ) minimum flow guideline , ensure access patency ; Not part research study would interfere dialysis treatment . Data Collection Hourly documentation Qb routine protocol HD ( hemodialysis ) unit , along Kt/V treatment termination . URR routinely draw every 6 week , however study drawn weekly , third treatment . Standard URR blood draw protocol follow : pre- post- dialysis blood specimen collect sent , along correspond requisition , analysis calculation . A research account open LifeLabs ( local laboratory service ) research requisition blood cod bill research study . Per unit protocol , blood draw write unit diary nurse awareness , blood collection tube requisition place participant ' chart night prior treatment . Once weekly , researcher photocopy participant ' treatment run log , along urea lab report , data inputted CHEOS-approved excel spreadsheet . Along Qb Kt/V , collect data include participant ' blood pressure , dialysate flow rate , dialysis duration , needle gauge cannulation , occurrence intradialytic complication . Data Analysis Data analysis conduct CHEOS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants select Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit . The inclusion criterion participant selection : 1 . Dialysing great six month ensure access patency , viability , stability ; 2 . Undergoing thrice weekly , fourhour dialysis session uniform dialysis duration ; 3 . Dialysing arteriovenous fistula , either brachiocephalic radiocephalic , control variance blood flow rate related vascular access ; 4 . Dialysing 15g needle organization policy restrict great flow rate small needle gauge ; 5 . Dialysing dialysate flow ( Qd ) 500 mL/min reduce possibility clearance attributable difference Qd ; 6 . Maintaining transonic vascular access flow &gt; 600 mL/min past 6 month , per Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) ( NKF , 2006 ) minimum flow guideline , ensure access patency . Patients speak language English , Cantonese , Mandarin , Punjabi exclude due funding constraint provide translate informed consent document . Informed consent document available language list , common language spoken/read dialysis unit . Patients dialyse central venous catheter , arteriovenous graft , femoral arteriovenous fistula invite participate due potential confound known difference access flow vessel quality may impact clearance value . Patients involve research study would interfere dialysis treatment would exclude study . Patients hemodynamically unstable ( e.g . : frequent 'crashing ' due severe hypotension ) exclude due instability would pose achieve prescribed dialysis time ( e.g . : crash , may take dialysis early ) result data .</criteria>
