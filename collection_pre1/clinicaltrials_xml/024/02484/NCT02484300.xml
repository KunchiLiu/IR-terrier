	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis oxidative stress induce repeat apneas obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient alter neural control breathe destabilizes ventilatory control exacerbate OSA . Thus antioxidant treatment potential reduce OSA severity . Melatonin hormone regulate sleep pattern , also potent antioxidant . Melatonin production suppress eye register light people healthy sleep exhibit peak blood serum level around 2am decrease towards morning . OSA patient exhibit low melatonin level later peak around 6am extends later day . This abnormal pattern think compound difficulty fall asleep daytime mental fatigue . Therefore potential benefit melatonin treatment OSA patient two-fold : importantly via antioxidant action melatonin may reduce chemoreflex sensitivity , stabilize ventilatory control reduce OSA severity ; normalize sleep phase melatonin may also allow patient fall asleep easy wake refresh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Melatonin Sleep Ventilatory Control Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSA common sleep disorder characterize repeat collapse upper airway sleep causing bout hypercapnia hypoxia , typically follow arousal , hyperventilation subsequent apnea . The resultant swing blood gas fragment sleep associate major neurocognitive cardiovascular sequela . Although commonly cite statistic 4 % middle age US men 2 % US woman symptomatic OSA , figure may underestimate . However despite prevalence well recognize consequence , treatment OSA remain unacceptable due poor adherence variable efficacy exist therapy , lead many advocate research underlie mechanism identify new therapeutic target . During sleep ventilatory control dominate level CO2 O2 blood . Arterial CO2 great influence , increase CO2 stimulate increase ventilatory drive vice versa . Ventilatory drive determines level activity thoracic pump muscle , also upper airway dilator muscle . Consequently upper airway susceptible collapse CO2 , therefore neural drive upper airway muscle , low . Loop gain engineering method use measure stability negative feedback chemoreflex control system , calculate ratio ventilatory response disturbance elicit response . Higher LG equal less stable control , disproportionately large ventilatory response result great degree hypocapnia subsequent reduction ventilatory drive . Thus high LG contributes propagate apneas . Supporting evidence OSA patient higher LG non-OSA LG correlate apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) . Additionally , treatment supplemental oxygen acetazolamide reduce LG significantly reduce AHI . However treatment essentially counteract high LG , rather treat cause high LG . LG include `` plant '' ( respiratory apparatus ) `` controller '' ( chemoreflex ) gain component . OSA patient exhibit abnormality chemoreflex control increase sensitivity blood gas thus increase controller LG . These abnormality normalize continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment , indicate induced OSA . Intermittent hypoxia , occurs repeat apnea , induces last change neural control breathe induces abnormality increase controller gain see OSA . Therefore think IH experience OSA contributes worsen OSA inducing change neural control breathe increase controller LG . The cellular change induce IH dependent formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) animal human study show antioxidant treatment prior IH experimentally block neural change . Thus antioxidant may suitable alternative treatment OSA , treat actual cause high LG . Indeed two publish study show vitamin N-acetyl-cysteine reduce AHI OSA patient . Melatonin hormone produce pineal gland brain well-known critical role regulate sleep circadian clock . However also potent antioxidant act direct free radical scavenger , also stimulate synthesis antioxidant . Unlike antioxidant also cross cell membrane easily , allow cross blood brain barrier also enter intracellular compartment mitochondria ROS production high . Owing fact antioxidant become reactive specie oxidize , many antioxidant become toxic cause disease prolong high dos . For reason antioxidant unsuitable long-term treatment option OSA . However melatonin problem oxidize convert multiple different metabolite various antioxidant function . This add efficacy neutralize extremely wide range radical specie . Consequently melatonin non-toxic even extremely high dos extend use . Indeed melatonin find effective treat multiple disease human associate ROS oxidative stress , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease multiple sclerosis . Of particular interest OSA intimately associate metabolic disorder , two condition compound negative consequence cardiovascular disease , melatonin show improve hypertension , oxidative stress blood lipid profile metabolic disorder . For reason , propose melatonin may safe long term treatment option OSA patient unable tolerate CPAP , may block neural change induce IH , thereby reduce controller LG therefore reduce AHI . Additionally , melatonin treatment may add benefit associate prevent ROS induced morbidity OSA metabolic disorder . Melatonin production inhibit light normally peak around 2am . However OSA exhibit much low level melatonin low peak around 6am . OSA associate chronic systemic oxidative stress endogenous level melatonin play critical role regulation total antioxidant status . Therefore abnormal pattern melatonin production OSA likely contributes exacerbation oxidative stress also sleep cognitive deficit OSA , would delay circadian sleep phase , make difficult patient fall asleep add mental fatigue morning . Therefore , addition antioxidant activity , melatonin treatment OSA may additional benefit via normalize sleep phase . Thus primary focus study investigate effect melatonin treatment OSA wake chemoreflex control ventilatory stability assess via LG AHI sleep , also intend assess additional sleep cardiovascular benefit melatonin treatment , assess melatonin blood serum phase reset effect , sleep quality , blood pressure electrocardiogram ( ECG ) .</detailed_description>
