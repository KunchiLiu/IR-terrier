	<brief_title>Brain Activation Satiety Children : Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high prevalence childhood obesity U.S. demand well understanding factor drive weight gain influence outcome pediatric obesity intervention . This project investigate hypothesis , adult , subset obese child experience diminish satiety response food consumption , child resistant gold standard family-based behavioral treatment ( FBT ) obesity . FBT target almost exclusively toward parent ; however , evidence obesity development response intervention may depend additional factor individual internal satiety perception variability function brain center associated impulsivity reward . The propose research use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) characterize brain function relate satiety examines fMRI along behavioral , cognitive , hormonal test fully examine potential mediator child 's experience satiety response FBT . The approach base evidence failure attenuate reward value palatable food eat manifestation blunt central satiety response reliably detect use fMRI . Key objectives determine difference central satiety response exist obese non-obese child , , among obese child , strength central satiety response associate impulsivity and/or success obesity treatment . The central hypothesis , obese child , blunt central nervous system satiety response impair success obesity intervention . To achieve study objective , brain activation high-calorie visual food cue food consumption measure fMRI . Participants obese non-obese child age 9-11 year . The 49 obese child evaluate participate 6-month evidence-based FBT intervention . Their pre-intervention fMRI compare 20 non-obese control test blunt central satiety response ( Aim 1 ) . The relationship impulsivity satiety response food intake determine obese child ( Aim 2 ) . The longitudinal component test whether central satiety response prior treatment predict treatment outcome ( Aim 3A ) whether change central satiety response treatment predict maintenance reduce weight 6 12 month treatment cessation ( Aim 3B ) . Behavioral , cognitive , hormonal measure examine potential mediating confound factor contribute fMRI response . The propose research guide integrate , transdisciplinary team expertise pediatric adult neuroimaging , appetite regulation , family-based childhood obesity treatment . This research provide new insight neurobiological basis child obesity relevance neurobiological factor treatment success . The long-term objective translate finding improve obesity intervention cost-effectively sustain good long-term result . During year 1-3 , obese child enrol intervention group 9-11 family stagger start date 3-6 month . Years 1-4 include enrollment , intervention , longitudinal follow-up , data collection obese child . Control child primarily recruit year 2-3 facilitate matching . FMRI scan process roll basis study complete . In year 3 4 hormonal assay perform . Final data analysis complete year 4 .</detailed_description>
