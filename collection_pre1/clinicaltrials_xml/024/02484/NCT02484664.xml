	<brief_summary>The investigator perform two-center phase I trial celecoxib ( COX-2 inhibitor ) administer 200mg mouth daily 6 month . Up 12 adult woman LAM recruit ( 4-8 site ) . The Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To investigate whether , LAM patient , celecoxib safe well tolerate , evidence clinical benefit . Aim 2 : To investigate potential value novel biomarker LAM , quantitative measurement number TSC2 mutant LAM cell per ml blood , assess disease severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>﻿Background : Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) characterize cystic lung destruction , kidney angiomyolipomas ( AMLs ) , LAM cell growth within axial lymphatics multiple organ surface . LAM occur sporadically association tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) . Sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , mTORC1 inhibitor , show stabilize lung function decline decrease angiomyolipoma tumor size TSC sporadic LAM patient . However , cessation rapamycin therapy result recurrent decline lung function , regrowth angiomyolipoma , suggest continuous use may require maintain beneficial effect . Recently investigator discover cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) function alter cell lack TSC2 , include LAM patient-derived angiomyolipoma cell line . COX-2 level increase , prostaglandin metabolite level increase , treatment COX-2 inhibitor effective reduce tumor size two different Tsc mouse model , one native tumor , xenograft model . Furthermore , rapamycin affect difference COX-2 expression prostaglandin metabolite . Objectives/Hypothesis : Our preclinical study indicate celecoxib ( COX-2 specific inhibitor ) decrease size TSC2-deficient tumor Tsc model . Hence investigator propose Pilot Clinical Trial test safety tolerability celecoxib patient LAM , preliminary assessment potential benefit use multiple approach . Specific aim : The primary endpoint pilot trial test safety tolerability treatment celecoxib patient mild-to-moderate LAM , currently sirolimus ; assess potential benefit treatment use follow : 1 . Spirometry , 2 . MRI measurement angiomyolipoma size , 3 . St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire , 4 . VEGF-D serum level . The investigator assess Exhaled breath condensate prostaglandin metabolite confirm effect celecoxib . The investigator also develop novel biomarker LAM ass response , quantitative measurement number TSC2 mutant circulate LAM cell , next generation sequence . Study design : The investigator perform pilot clinical trial investigate safety tolerability celecoxib therapy single agent patient LAM . LAM subject take everolimus rapamycin treat celecoxib 200mg PO QD 6 month . They monitor respiratory function angiomyolipoma size . At end 6 month period , celecoxib discontinue , subject monitor another 6 month . Clinical Impact : Sirolimus medical therapy show reduce tumor size stabilize lung function patient LAM TSC-LAM . Although sirolimus clear benefit , result MILES trial suggest continuous therapy form require , rate decline lung function resume sirolimus discontinue . The investigator hope celecoxib show benefit minimal toxicity trial , provide alternative approach long term prophylactic/preventive treatment patient mild-to-moderate LAM . Our study include patient TSC LAM , often appear slowly progressive sporadic LAM , hence long term therapy celecoxib may particular benefit TSC LAM population . In addition , investigator develop quantitative measure circulate LAM cell level part trial .</detailed_description>
