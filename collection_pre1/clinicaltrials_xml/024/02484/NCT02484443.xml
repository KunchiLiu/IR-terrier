	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well dinutuximab work give sargramostim treat patient osteosarcoma come back treatment ( recurrent ) . Monoclonal antibody , dinutuximab , may find tumor cell help kill . Sargramostim may help body increase amount white blood cell produce , help body fight infection . Giving dinutuximab sargramostim may work good kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dinutuximab Combination With Sargramostim Treating Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine disease control rate patient completely resect recurrent osteosarcoma treat ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combination sargramostim ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ GM-CSF ] ) compare historical Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) experience . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) patient recurrent osteosarcoma propose administration schedule . II . To determine occurrence unacceptable toxicity ( UT ) patient recurrent osteosarcoma treat ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combination sargramostim . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship probability disease control tumor GD2 expression . II . To assess killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR ) Fcgamma receptor ( FcgammaR ) genotype , natural killer cell p30 ( NKp30 ) isoforms circulate ligand , B7-H6 , relationships probability disease control . III . To attempt bank tumor sample future research study patient enrol study undergo biopsy resection suspect metastatic disease recurrence protocol therapy evaluation period . IV . To determine descriptive profile human anti-chimeric antibody ( HACA ) immunotherapy . V. To bank serial plasma sample future study circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( ctDNA ) detection marker disease progression response . OUTLINE : Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 dinutuximab intravenously ( IV ) 20 hour day 4 5 ( dinutuximab infusion may extend additional 2 day anticipate toxicity ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 12 month .</detailed_description>
