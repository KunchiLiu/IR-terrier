	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well CPI-613 ( 6,8-bis [ benzylthio ] octanoic acid ) , cytarabine , mitoxantrone hydrochloride work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia granulocytic sarcoma ( malignant , green-colored tumor myeloid cell [ type immature white blood cell ] ) return ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid thought kill cancer cell turn mitochondrion . Mitochondria use cancer cell produce energy building block need make cancer cell . By shut mitochondrion , 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid deprive cancer cell energy supply need survive grow body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine mitoxantrone hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid together cytarabine mitoxantrone hydrochloride may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility CPI-613 administer high dose cytarabine , mitoxantrone ( mitoxantrone hydrochloride ) three phase salvage therapy ( induction , consolidation maintenance ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe response rate ( complete remission [ CR ] , CR incomplete recovery [ CRi ] ) CPI-613 combination high dose cytarabine mitoxantrone . II . To observe overall survival patient treat CPI-613 combination high dose cytarabine mitoxantrone induction , consolidation maintenance . III . To monitor toxicity experience patient treated CPI-613 combination high dose cytarabine mitoxantrone induction , consolidation maintenance . OUTLINE : SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 1 : Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-5 , cytarabine IV 3 hour every 12 hour start day 3 5 dos , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 15 minute first , third , fifth dos cytarabine . SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 2 ( OPTIONAL , AT DISCRETION OF TREATING PHYSICIAN ) : Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid , cytarabine , mitoxantrone hydrochloride course 1 abbreviated second course discretion treat physician . In abbreviated course , patient receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 1-3 , cytarabine IV 3 hour every 12 hour start day 2 3 dos , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 15 minute first third cytarabine dos . SALVAGE CONSOLIDATION : Patients achieve response receive 2 course abbreviated course 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid , high dose cytarabine , mitoxantrone hydrochloride . Patients achieve response may undergo stem cell transplant discretion treat physician . Patients may proceed maintenance 1 , 2 course consolidation discretion treat physician . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients achieve response receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
