	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate impact package intervention include production distribution locally produce complementary food ( via so-called `` Grain-banks '' ) Micronutrient Powders ( MNPs ) supplementation , optimize food base Complementary Feeding Recommendation , growth micronutrient status infant young child . The impact intervention package evaluate quasi-experimental matched-control cluster design infant young child 6 - 29 month age . The impact , outcome , output indicator infants/children assess cross-sectional sample baseline , 9 18 month . A total of60 pair cluster select 15 household per cluster identify eligible population . A total 1800 child intervention match-controlled cluster , sample target age group . Qualitative quantitative data collect gather information Knowledge , Attitude Practice ( KAP ) , Infant Young Child Feeding practice , anthropometry anemia , follow impact pathway develop study . Research question answer program evaluation : 1 . What impact extend pilot ( implementation local complementary food production MNP ) : 1 . Growth child 17-29 month age 2 . Infant Young Child Feeding practice child ( 6-23m ) , 3 . Anemia status child 11-23 ? 2 . What determine factor impact/no impact relate : 1 . Immediate outcome : skill capacity ; knowledge , attitude practice ; improve access 2 . Intermediate outcome : utilization ; provision , ensure enable environment 3 . Program performance measure program monitoring data output activity ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study ass impact/effectiveness improve intervention infant growth micronutrient status measure would happen absence intervention . The study conduct four region Ethiopia program intervention take place namely , Amhara , Tigray , Oromiya , South Nations Nationalities Peoples Region ( SNNPR ) region . - Sample size calculation assume expect difference 0.2 Standard Deviation ( SD ) HAZ , 5 % difference feeding practice , 80 % power , Î±-error 5 % ; cluster effect approximately 2 . - A total 1800 child sample intervention non-intervention ( control ) village . A total 120 cluster choose group . Each intervention cluster match control cluster select similar geographical ecological condition , access health-care centre , status food security existence Community Based Nutrition ( CBN ) programme . Within pair cluster , household randomly select complete listing eligible household . A total 15 household identify 120 cluster . - Demographics socio-economic status indicator collect use Demographic Health Surveys ( DHS ) method . - Infant Young Child feed indicator assess child 6-23 month baseline , mid- endline - Knowledge attitude practice concern intervention exposure indicator include perception utilization complementary food , MNP , use perception grain bank assess baseline , mid- endline caregiver . Data analysis include : - For demographic socio- economic characteristic study participant descriptive statistic use . - To calculate nutritional status child 6-23 month , Epi-Info/Emergency Nutrition Action ( ENA ) SMART software use . - The median ( min , max ) weight number MNP consume per day intervention period calculate measure compliance ; however analyse do base intention-to-treat . - Qualitative data record digital recorder transcribe first local language English . Then specific theme identify matrix prepare data analyse . - The qualitative data analyse separately triangulation make compare result . - All analysis do intention-to-treat basis , take account matched-controlled design . For continuous variable use linear mixed model include cluster , household child random effect account clustered observation . Fixed effect include model covariates child 's sex , age , household socio-economic status relevant baseline value . Normality examine create Quantile-Quantile ( QQ ) plot subsequent visual inspection . Equal variance assure Levene 's test . - For categorical variable mixed-effects logistic regression model use random effect cluster household .</detailed_description>
