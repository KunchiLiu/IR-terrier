	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare clinical outcome arthroscopic rotator cuff repair without augmentation mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) . Mesenchymal stem cell promote tissue regeneration differentiate adult cell line supply growth factor implant environment . They show effective improve overall heal tendon integrity rotator cuff repair . This study follow 100 patient United States track clinical outcome least one year post-operatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff repair one commonly perform arthroscopic procedure United States , re-tear remains common long-term complication . This lead pain , decrease shoulder function , need corrective surgery . Mesenchymal stem cell show improve heal rate arthroscopic rotator cuff repair , primarily due retain ability differentiate several different adult cell line , tenocytes , chondrocytes , osteoblast . MSCs enhance heal process release growth factor local environment promote tissue regeneration . While MSC augmentation arthroscopic rotator cuff repair lead high rate heal improved tendon integrity , remain paucity data surround clinical improvement procedure . Outcomes post-operative strength , range motion , shoulder function yet compare standard rotator cuff repair . The incidence post-operative persistent structural defect tendon MSC augmentation must also elucidate .</detailed_description>
