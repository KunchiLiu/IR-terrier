	<brief_summary>This study demonstrate functional improvement measure 6-month period chronic low back patient care Primary Care Provider ( PCP ) , use therapeutic plan formulate initially Pain Medicine Specialist ( PMS ) , equivalent care PMS . Chronic low back pain patient initially evaluate PMS . If interventional pain therapy require , multimodal therapeutic plan ( pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological ) formulate manage chronic low back pain .

	<detailed_description>In trial , chronic low back pain patient present Rush University Pain Center initially evaluate PMS.The initial evaluation visit , part routine care new low back patient , include follow : full physical examination , review medical health medication history , radiological imaging ( EHR use study ) . In addition , new patient need provide urine drug screen test need undergo psychological testing evaluation . A determination make PMS whether best treatment modality include interventional approach non-interventional . If interventional pain therapy require , multimodal therapeutic plan ( pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological ) formulate manage chronic low back pain . A complete workup perform accomplish task . If non-interventional treatment ( pharmacological non-pharmacological ) select , implement PCP , patient inform study , interested , Prescreening Informed Consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) form obtain patient give permission contact PCP . At point , patient ' PCPs contact , present study information , ask want participate study . If PCP agree , Main Study Informed Consent obtain patient . Patients meet criterion would randomize one two treatment group continue treatment next 6 month . This initial multimodal therapeutic treatment alter respective treatment group ( PMS PCP ) study subject randomize . Group 1 ( PMS treatment ) : Subjects continue follow next 6 month PMS ( typically every month treatment chronic pain ) per standard protocol . The PCP involve treatment . Group 2 ( PCP treatment ) : Subjects follow PCP next 6 month . The PCP involve use EHR multimodal therapeutic strategy communicate PCP PMS . The PCP make dosage base algorithm provide PMS adjust drug dos time ( general templateâ€”See ) . It intend PCP may ongoing engagement PMS . While PCP may request clarification PMS first week subject treatment , contact PCP PMS would result subject withdraw study . In addition , direct line communication set PCP data integration clinical coordinator handle serious medical concern . In case serious medical event , subject withdrawn study appropriate medical care provide PMS PCP . Group 1 &amp; 2 : Subjects group undergo follow : 1 . Urine drug screen test ( qualitative ) ; include amphetamine , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cannabinoids , cocaine , ethanol , opioids 2 . Receive sample copy opioid contract/agreement 3 . PMS query Illinois prescription monitor program patient determine various health care provider prescribe narcotic control medication . 4 . Undergo psychological test evaluation Rush University Pain Center psychologist ( include Screener Opioid Assessment Patients Pain-Revised ( SOAPP-R ) 13 ) , determine risk drug abuse . Template treatment low back pain provide PCP . This template suggestion , clinical medical judgment patient decide PMS . Listed category pharmacological non-pharmacological modality , PMS formulate patient-specific prescriptive plan evaluation initial work-up : 1 . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) : preferably COX-2 inhibitor patient . If NSAIDs prescribe , GI prophylaxis need provided.14,15 This would prescribe patient provide daily 'as need ' medication , unless adverse event prevent administration . 2 . Muscle relaxant : pharmacological agent include baclofen , tizanidine , lorazepam relieve painful muscle spasms16 3 . Opioids : long-acting opioids ( oxycodone , controlled- release ) , short-acting opioids ( e.g . hydrocodone/acetaminophen ) 14,15,17 4 . Anticonvulsants : mainly gabapentin pregabalin18 5 . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) unit19 At end 6-month treatment period ( end study ) , patient give option continue treatment group change treatment available . A research study nurse , blind group allocation , call patient ( group ) every month collect BPI questionnaire responses phone . In addition , general measure functional health well-being , SF-36 health-related quality life outcome measure ( Short-Form 36 Health Survey ) , collect call.21 The SF-36 total score use overall health measure , measure two different health domain : physical health ( include bodily pain ) mental health , well division specific subscales . A baseline BPI SF-36 obtain subject 's initial visit record ( EHR ) . The research study nurse enter data obtain phone call directly Rush University Pain Centers ( RUPC ) EHR eClinicalWorks platform . To evaluate procedural variation , side effect secondary outcomes 6 month follow-up treatment period , data integration clinical coordinator ( DICC ) , blind group allocation , query electronic physical health record , PCP PMS , well correspond HIS 's .</detailed_description>
