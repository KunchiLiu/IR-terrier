	<brief_summary>Rituximab frequently use adult pediatric cancer , blood disorder , lymphoma ( cancerous growth make lymphoid tissue ) , graft-versus-host-disease ( complication occur stem cell bone marrow transplant ) , diseases immune system ( cell substance protect body infection ) rheumatologic condition . Rituximab work decrease temporarily eliminate specific type white blood cell , B-lymphocyte . Overall , rituximab generally well tolerate . The likelihood infusion-related reaction , symptom fever , chill , hive , low blood pressure swell , low , high patient 's first infusion rituximab decrease additional dose . Adults commonly receive rituximab faster rate do well first infusion , study help determine approach well tolerated child . In study , investigator test new method administer rituximab may reduce time take receive medication . The initial ordered amount rituximab change current standard care ( mean usually do doctor , would likely do study ) . The period time rituximab give studied .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard care patient receive rituximab give dose slowly gradually increase rate rituximab full dose give , may take several hour . This do order prevent side effect rituximab call infusion reaction . Infusion reaction similar allergic reaction may cause symptom low blood pressure , wheeze , chest tightness , fever , itching , bad cough , blue skin color , seizure , swell face , lip , tongue , throat . In study , investigator test method give rituximab short period time . Administering rituximab faster rate do commonly safely adult population side effect . The drug rituximab give infusion outpatient clinic . Infusion mean drug give use needle tubing insert vein ( also call IV ) period time . If patient cancer blood disorder , receive rituximab administration 90 minute , 20 % dose give first 30 minute remain 80 % dose give 60 minute . This standard method infusing dose rituximab adult cancer blood disorder , do well first dose rituximab standard infusion rate . If patient rheumatologic disease , receive rituximab administration 120 minute , 12.5 % dose give first 30 minute remain 87.5 % dose give 90 minute . This standard method infusing dose rituximab adult rheumatologic disorder , do well first dose rituximab standard infusion rate . During time , investigator also assess see patient side effect receive fast infusion 15 minute follow end infusion . Patients also follow phone clinic one week rapid infusion rituximab see side effect . Before patient receive rituximab , receive acetaminophen diphenhydramine . These medication give help prevent infusion reaction occur . These medication always give matter quickly rituximab give . If infusion reaction occur , rituximab infusion stop patient receive medication help reverse reaction . Once reaction go away , patient 's doctor determine receive rest rituximab dose . Patients receive one rapid infusion rituximab part participation study . If patient infusion-related reaction eligible receive subsequent infusion protocol discretion provider . Patients ask allow u view collect information medical record prior infusion ensure eligibility obtain baseline data , need day infusion next clinical follow monitor side effect infusion . Data collect medical record include limited , demographic information ( age , race/ethnicity , weight , diagnosis , indication rituximab ) .</detailed_description>
