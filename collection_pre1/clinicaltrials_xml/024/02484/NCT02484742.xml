	<brief_summary>The main purpose study learn effect repeat exposure sleep disruption ( 3 cycle sleep disruption , consist three day row sleep shorten disrupt , follow single night recovery sleep ) inflammation , mood , pain processing ( experiences/perceptions pain ) . Purpose research project understand mechanism sleep disruption may change mood experience pain . Understanding mechanisms important develop intervention may help reduce effect sleep disruption mood pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Screening Procedures : For research study , screen procedure include follow activity . Participants first complete questionnaire interview ask question concern general health status sleep-wake habit . Also visit , study nurse collect small blood sample use test number marker general health status . If appear participant may eligible participation , s/he introduce electronic diary email every morning even monitor sleep-wake pattern , mood , pain , health-related information . Following medical screening ( visit 2 ) , physician determine participant eligible proceed overnight sleep study . This consist sleep overnight laboratory usual sleep time . Seven day participation in-hospital portion study , member study team ask participant follow study sleep-wake schedule . Sleep monitored electronic sleep diary participant wear actigraphy watch , help evaluate sleep measure light level exposure start study . 2 . Randomization Procedures : Each participant complete part study protocol , i.e. , experimental condition ( participant undergo repeat cycle sleep disruption , 18 day total Clinical Research Center ) control condition ( participant sleep opportunity 8 hour every night ; 18 day total Clinical Research Center ) . 3 . Research Procedures : If participant qualifies take part research study , s/he require stay hospital two 18 day long research protocol . These protocol take place least 2-3 month apart . The experimental protocol include 3 night 8 hour-sleep per night follow three 4-day cycle , consist 3 night shorten disrupted sleep , follow single night 8 hour recovery sleep . After last cycle , participant two night 8 hour sleep per night . In control protocol , 18 day 8-hour sleep night . During stay hospital , research staff accompany participant wake time . The staff help participant stay schedule , maintain wakefulness , make sure equipment record properly . Both study protocols begin two adaptation night . On first day protocol , participant tell sleep condition assign first : sleep disruption condition sleep control condition . During sleep disruption night , sleep onset delay one hour ( midnight 12am ) , sleep offset ( final wake ) advance one hour ( 6am ) . The sleep period ( 12-6am ) disrupt hourly 20 minute long awakening . During nighttime period , nurse measure blood pressure collect small sample saliva . The participant also ask complete test ass well-being cognitive functioning ( attention , learn ) . After last day third cycle , participant four night 8 hour sleep per night . The participant able leave research center morning 18th night . During two 18-day stay hospital , participant wear actigraphy watch study day , help evaluate sleep measure light level exposure . The participant also two blood draw obtain simple needle stick intermittent day . Additionally , 24-hour period , study team collect sleep recording data ( use polysomnography device 24-hour period ) . Finally , study team collect urine sample course protocol . Blood pressure measure frequent interval study . Computerized performance test conduct frequent interval study . One test involve measurement reaction time participant press button little box . In another performance test study team ask participant press right leave mouse button depend whether word computer screen print color different color ; do quickly accurately possible . In addition , ask participant rate well-being frequent interval throughout stay Clinical Research Center . On several day stay Clinical Research Center , investigator test perception pain . During pain testing , participant remain comfortable chair throughout test session . The test consist measure pain threshold ( first feeling sensation pain heat mechanical stimulus ) , pain tolerance ( pain sensation feel intolerable ) , pain modulation ( central nervous system change perception pain ) . 4 . Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures . For research study , monitoring/follow-up procedure include meet one lead member study team last day 18-day protocol . During time , study team member discus participant 's study experience give opportunity ask question concern study .</detailed_description>
