	<brief_summary>Background : Long-term management Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) reach full potential due lack knowledge disease progression . The Real-PD study aim evaluate feasibility compliance usage wearable sensor PD patient real life . Moreover , explorative analysis concern activity level , medication intake mood do . Methods : Overall , 1000 PD patient 250 physiotherapist enrol observational study . Dutch PD patient recruit across country assessment perform use short version Parkinson 's Progression Markers Initiative ( PPMI ) protocol . Moreover , participant wear set medical device ( Pebble Smartwatch , fall detector ) use smartphone The Fox Insight App ( Android app ) , 24/7 , 13 week . Primary measure interest : 1 ) physical activity , fall tremor , measure axial accelerometer embed Pebble watch fall detector ; 2 ) medication intake mood report measure patient ' self-report Android app . To measure motor impact , assessment perform physiotherapist Unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale - ( MDS-UPDRS ) certify . Discussion : Management PD patient complex appear challenge task health care professional . The main reason lack knowledge disease pattern . This issue could solve long term follow-up patient ' everyday life , wearable medical device act way collect data every day life activity . Therefore , Real-PD study first contribution increase lack knowledge disease progression , develop new medical decision system improve PD patient ' care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-PD Trial : Development Clinical Prognostic Models Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Today 's management patient chronic disorder like Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) imperfect . The understanding clinical profile base observation small , selective population brief follow-up . Moreover , treatment decision base averaged population result may apply specific individual context . These drawback address `` big data '' approach . Ambulatory sensor use objective measure patient ' performance everyday circumstance , long period time . The researcher aim explore potential use longitudinal ambulatory data enrich standardize clinical dataset , reflect current clinical practice assessment disease status . Objective : The study include total 250 physiotherapist 1000 patient . The aim study : ( 1 ) perform `` big data '' analysis raw sensor data , relation concurrently acquire clinical data patient ( limited version PPMI -Parkinson 's Progression Markers Initiative protocol ) develop patient profile ; ( 2 ) correlate ambulatory sensor data simple self-assessments make follow-up . Study design : Observational descriptive study . Study population : Dutch Parkinson patient , male female , age 30 year old , PD diagnosis give physician , suitable smartphone . lntervention : 250 ParkinsonNet physiotherapist 1000 eligible patient include study . Patients physiotherapist recruit 5 consecutive cohort base geographic region . Patients ask wear smartwatch pendant movement sensor , triaxial accelerometer , day night , period 13 week . Additionally , self-monitoring App smartphone use , patient report ( ) take PD medication . An additional , optional button allow patient report general feeling . During 13 week follow-up , trained physiotherapist perform standardized clinical assessment , base PPMI protocol ( www.ppmi-info.ors ) every included patient . This assessment last 60 minute . The smartphone use transmit data watch cloud-based data platform . lntel develop dedicate data analysis platform ambulatory data . lntel receive cod data . Main study parameters/endpoints : Study endpoint include parameter register smartwatch , pendant movement sensor , self-monitoring app collect PPMI assessment . The smartwatch data provide , data processing , measure level physical activity day . Falls register pendant movement sensor . Medication intake mood register use smartphone . Finally , PPMI assessment include assessment motor symptom , cognition , depression , sleep daily activity . Correlations determine mentioned parameter . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : First , participant ask wear device 24/7 data record continuously , total duration 13 week . Second , data transmit data platform develop manage lntel , behalf Michael J . Fox Foundation Parkinson 's Research . To access data , researcher grant permission research purpose , provide Michael J . Fox Foundation . Patients ask permission share raw cod data dissemination research community , analysis use future publication . Participation study warrant patient provide write permission .</detailed_description>
