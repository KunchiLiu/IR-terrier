	<brief_title>Amlodipine Adjuvant Treatment Iron Chelation Prevention Cardiac Iron Overload Thalassemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection Study Population : The study enroll 60 adult subject transfusion dependent thalassemia receive deferasirox iron chelation therapy . All eligible subject ask provide informed consent participate study . Randomization : Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio either continuation DFX ( control arm ) combination DFX plus amlodipine ( amlodipine arm ) . Treatment : Subjects randomize amlodipine arm receive open label medication ( amlodipine ) start 2.5mg/day up-titrated 2.5mg every 7-14 day goal reach 10mg/day . DFX dose either arm adjust unless deem unsafe remain dose DFX treat physician ( significant side effect , lack efficacy over-chelation ) T2* drop 8 ms. Safety Assessment : Weekly fortnightly amlodipine titration conduct research physician in-clinic , base blood pressure , tolerability , presence absence side-effects . Adverse Events assess every visit first dose last subject visit . Efficacy Assessment : efficacy amlodipine combine standard chelation therapy assess cardiac T2*MRI , do baseline 12 month post treatment .</detailed_description>
