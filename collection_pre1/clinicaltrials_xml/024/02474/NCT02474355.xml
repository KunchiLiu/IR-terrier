	<brief_title>Real World Treatment Study AZD9291 Advanced/Metastatic EGFR T790M Mutation NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective study assess efficacy safety single agent AZD9291 real world set adult patient advance metastatic , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) T790M mutation-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , receive prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy . Study site ( ) number patient plan : Approximately 1500 patient recruit Europe . The recruitment increase beyond study expand region world ( America , Asia ) . Study Design This open-label , single-arm , multinational , multicenter , real world treatment study . Target patient population : Adult patient ( fulfil definition `` age majority '' per local regulation ) locally advanced ( stage IIIB ) metastatic ( stage IV ) NSCLC confirm T790M mutation , receive prior EGFR-TKI therapy . Investigational product ( IP ) , dosage , mode administration : AZD9291 oral , potent , selective , irreversible inhibitor EGFR-TKI sensitise resistance mutation NSCLC significant selectivity margin wild-type EGFR . AZD9291 administer orally one 80 mg tablet day . Duration IP administration : Patients may continue receive AZD9291 long continue show clinical benefit , judge investigator , absence discontinuation criterion ) . The study close participate country soon possible follow national reimbursement AZD9291 country ( max 90 day post reimbursement ) . Enrolment close within 6 month market license approval country national reimbursement , whichever sooner . Patients withdraw treatment prior national reimbursement follow part study . Patients treatment receive commercial supply documented disease progression per investigator assessment . In event national reimbursement grant follow reasonable time market license approval country , study close maximum period 18 month last patient enrol country . If applicable , timelines conversion commercial drug agree local body may include regulatory agency , ethic committee , institution . Patient follow death lose follow-up . Study measure : Data collect include patient demographic , information need determine patient eligibility ( include medical history , past current disease characteristic , tumor EGFR mutational status ) , AZD9291 exposure , investigator-reported efficacy ( include tumor response disease progression ) , overall survival ( OS ) , safety ( include serious adverse event [ SAEs ] , adverse event lead dose modification , adverse event special interest [ interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis-like event , QTc prolongation event ] ) . Statistical method : All data present overall full analysis/evaluable set , also cohorts define number type previous treatment line advance disease . Descriptive statistic use variable , appropriate . Continuous variable summarise number observation , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum . Categorical variable summarise frequency count percentages category . OS PFS summarize use Kaplan-Meier estimate median time death censor quartile together 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>

Locally advanced ( stage IIIB ) metastatic ( stage IV ) EGFRm NSCLC , amenable curative surgery radiotherapy , confirmation presence T790M mutation 4 . Prior therapy EGFRTKI . Patients may also receive additional line treatment 5 . World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 02 6 . Adequate bone marrow reserve organ function demonstrate complete blood count , biochemistry blood urine baseline ( please refer IB guidance ) 7 . ECG record baseline show absence cardiac abnormality per exclusion criterion # 6 8 . Female patient childbearing potential must use adequate contraceptive measure , must breast feeding , must negative pregnancy test prior start dose . Otherwise , must evidence nonchildbearing potential 9 . Male patient must willing use barrier contraception , i.e. , condom 1 . Previous ( within 6 month ) current treatment AZD9291 2 . Patients currently receive ( unable stop use least 1 week prior receive first dose AZD9291 ) treatment know potent inhibitor inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 3 . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension , active bleeding diatheses , active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus , significantly impair bone marrow reserve organ function , include hepatic renal impairment , investigator 's opinion would significantly alter risk/benefit balance . 4 . Patient symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid manage CNS symptom within 2 week prior start AZD9291 administration ; 5 . Past medical history ILD , druginduced ILD , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active ILD 6 . Any following cardiac criterion : 1 . Mean resting correct QT interval ( QTcF ) &gt; 470 m use Fredericia 's formula : 2 . Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction morphology rest ECG ( e.g. , complete leave bundle branch block , third degree heart block , second degree heart block ) 3 . Any factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event 7 . Any unresolved toxicity prior therapy CTCAE &gt; grade 3 time start treatment 8 . History hypersensitivity excipients AZD9291 drug similar chemical structure class AZD9291</criteria>
