	<brief_title>Study Type Pushing Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter randomize , clinical trial : direct closed-glottis push ( push hold one 's breath ) vs. direct open-glottis push ( push prolong exhalation ) active phase labor fetus descend birth canal ( second stage ) . Study plan procedure : During prenatal care visit , woman inform study poster hang maternity unit midwife ' office . All participate staff — , professional teach childbirth preparation parenthood class agree participate study midwife , include randomize woman manage delivery -- train advance push technique teach support woman . A video intend specifically professional produce study make possible standardize instruction professional provide woman type push . Midwives ( hospital-based private practice ) lead childbirth preparation parenthood class inform woman study 's existence . During one class session , pregnant woman receive structured instruction , include video specifically create woman study , describe type direct push . They also access training video , available online website Auvergne perinatal health network ( http : //www.auvergne-perinat.org/ ) . They also receive write brochure study . Moreover , complete instruction receive card attest instruction , ask keep blood group card ( minimize possibility lose ) . This information also include paper obstetrics record electronic record , section `` action take . '' The midwife perform instruction provide local study coordinator list woman train type push plan participate study give birth one participate maternity unit . These list available unit , study file information form blank consent form store . At admission , midwife-investigator manage delivery verify woman 's eligibility , inform study , sign write consent . The co-interventions ( analgesia , oxytocin , position maternal , etc . ) associate labor monitor identical usual management participate maternity unit . The midwife manage delivery determine moment active labor thus bear push effort begin . In accordance standard practice French maternity unit , clinical examination privilege ; preliminary ultrasound perform unless otherwise plan . Nonetheless , fetal heart rate frequency uterine contraction monitor continuously , external tocodynamometer , throughout labor expulsive effort ( intermittent auscultation authorize determination eligibility/inclusion ) . Investigators determine 20 minute type push used appear ineffective ask mother switch type , think useful . In latter case , woman remain initial group ( intention-to-treat analysis ) intervention consider failure . If fetal heart rate abnormality obstetric emergency occur , midwife and/or supervise obstetrician sole decision-makers , jointly mother , extent possible ensue medical management ( change push technique , instrumental delivery , cesarean ) . In case , reason decision describe research file . After delivery , midwife supervise delivery complete simple descriptive form reporting adherence assign push technique course delivery . Values covariables relevant study complete clinical research assistant . The woman receive questionnaire e-mail satisfaction management delivery 4 week afterwards . They also see postnatal visit , mandatory France , 6 8 week delivery . This visit include examination pelvic floor . Women also complete questionnaire . Randomization After midwife-investigator verified inclusion inclusion criterion collect sign informed consent , contact study website run randomization program allocate woman one push group , accord list described . Once randomization perform , patient inform group assign : `` open-glottis push '' `` closed-glottis push '' . The type push assign used patient instruct push . The randomization list create computer program design group independent clinical research center investigator-coordinator . It stratify maternity ward , accord parity ( nulliparas v multiparas ) epidural analgesia use randomization , block 4 6 . The randomization data collection perform website available 24 hour day , investigator . Because department internet access either delivery room medical office , mode randomization possible secure . Data collection : The electronic case report file ( CRF ) include several part : - One administrative information ( center number , patient investigator name , etc . ) - One part contain clinical relevant data available woman 's medical file - A short section collect medical data usually available patient record ( type push , change type push , number push per contraction , etc . ) - A patient satisfaction questionnaire woman complete - Data related pelvic floor status ( questionnaire clinical examination ) postnatal check-ups delivery . Before randomization , inclusion exclusion criterion verify aid computer software . This computer software also use others variable useful research . The randomization take place online , study website . The study double- single-blinded . The midwife-investigator manage delivery complete simple descriptive form include data usually find patient medical record ( type push , number push per contraction , compliance allocate intervention ) . The patient include study provide address , telephone number , email address consent form . Should satisfaction questionnaire return reminder email , receive reminder telephone . Appointments postnatal check-up ( study pelvic floor function ) make department woman 's discharge . She receive `` reminder '' SMS appointment well telephone reminder fail keep appointment . This mandatory postpartum consultation French parturients ( 6 8 week postpartum ) . The study use several different data source : After delivery , midwife-investigator enter data special section CFR , provide information generally include patient medical record ( adherence , station onset active second stage , type push , etc . ) study website . The patient 's medical record , data . Data mention routinely collect medical record reentered computerized study file , available website . The satisfaction questionnaire complete online directly woman . The report postnatal check-up similarly enter online directly professional performed , questionnaire woman 's functional perception pelvic floor function transcribe online time . Quality assurance plan : Data collection notebook study : All information require protocol must enter electronic CRF . The relevant information record obtain transcribed clearly legibly electronic notebook . This electronic data collection notebook built-in quality control feature ensure quality data entry . This electronic record available secure access website , investigator-coordinator remotely oversee record maternity unit participate study . Moreover : - The investigator undertakes conduct study compliance Good Clinical Practices French public health law [ Act n°2004-806 date 9 August 2004 concern biomedical research , implement decree n° 2006-477 date 26/04/2006 , modifies portion Public Health Code ( specifically , Part 1 , Book 1 , Title II , Section 1 ) concern biomedical research , well decree force ] . The investigator also undertakes conduct research accordance Declaration Helsinki World Medical Association ( Tokyo 2004 , revise ) . - The investigator coordinator appoint sponsor ensure appropriate performance study , collection data generate writing , documentation , record , reporting , accordance standard operating procedure Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital Center compliance Good Clinical Practices applicable legislative regulatory provision . The investigator guarantee authenticity data collect study accept legal provision authorize study sponsor set quality control procedure . The investigator-coordinator investigator therefore agree make available quality control inspection conduct regular interval maternity unit , investigator-coordinator . During visit , follow item check : - Informed consent - Compliance research protocol procedure define therein - Assurance quality data collect electronic CRF : accuracy , miss data , consistency data source document ( paper electronic medical file questionnaire complete midwife ) . Reporting adverse event : According current scientific data , conformity exclusion criterion study ensure lack threat life mother child . Pushing essential practice vaginal delivery part routine care . The data literature show serious maternal neonatal complication associate particular type push . Nonetheless , serious event mother child , specifically transfer intensive care unit death , report immediately special form bring immediately attention principal investigator Sponsor . Sample size assessment : Based French national database ( Audipog : http : //www.audipog.net ) ./interro-choices.php ) compliance type push found literature , investigator estimate : - For α = 0.05 power 90 % , - And estimate Audipog database woman deliver spontaneously , without perineal lesion ( , without episiotomy spontaneous 2nd , 3rd , 4th degree laceration ) account 49.6 % parturients , investigator estimate use bilateral test show absolute difference group 20 % ( 49.6 % vs. 69.6 % , relative difference order 40 % ) would require 125 woman per group . Statistical analysis plan The analysis primary outcome include woman randomize assigned interventional ( direct open glottis push ) control group ( direct closed-glottis push ) accord intention-to-treat analysis . Women use type push initially allocate randomization remain initial group analysis ; type push consider failure . The potential deviation push protocol assign reason ( patient 's refusal inability follow type , inefficacy , clinical necessity , etc . ) describe . Ineligible inclusion occur , give randomization completion electronic CRF late point inclusion . The characteristic woman include study first describe . Their initial comparability describe , especially social demographic data , prognostic risk factor outcome measure , take account potential confounding factor statistical analysis . A secondary per protocol analysis plan . Statistical technique The baseline characteristic woman child ( age , weight , parity , etc . ) two group compare Chi 2 test ( Fisher 's exact test appropriate ) qualitative variable Student 's test quantitative variable . The principal result report crude relative risk ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval . Simple descriptive statistic use report relative infrequent data ( transfer NICU ) . A multivariate analysis ( manual backward stepwise logistic regression ) perform take prognostic confounding factor account obtain adjusted RRs . A center effect seek handle , necessary , Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test , compare efficacy type push group An analysis accord parity plan . Each secondary endpoint undergo analysis identical principal endpoint . The result report crude risk relative ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval . An interim analysis plan assess need adjust study calendar . This interim analysis perform half planned subject include . Adherence type push France currently unknown . To preserve overall threshold 5 % final analysis , interim analysis use threshold 0.1 % . Plan miss data The miss data treat missing .</detailed_description>
