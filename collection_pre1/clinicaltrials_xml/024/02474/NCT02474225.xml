	<brief_summary>The introduction additional fluid vitreous cavity intravitreal therapy would expect cause immediate rise intraocular pressure . This transient , short-term intraocular pressure elevation ( last 30 minute ) intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy well describe . The investigator aim study prevalence sustain intraocular pressure elevation associate intravitreal injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure Change Following Intravitreal Injection Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent commonly use treat variety retinal choroidal neovascular disease . The introduction additional fluid vitreous cavity intravitreal therapy would expect cause immediate rise intraocular pressure . Although one study show significant change intraocular pressure many retrospective study show impact intraocular pressure elevation . The investigator aim prospective evaluate intraocular pressure change non-glaucomatous patient receive intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy .</detailed_description>
