	<brief_summary>The 'Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis ' posit accumulation peptide , amyloid beta ( Aβ ) , brain initiating event Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , however , mechanism involve well understood . Recent study support hypothesis Aβ dynamic brain influence sleep-wake cycle , increase production soluble Aβ wakefulness decrease non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep , specifically NREM stage 3 ( also call slow wave sleep [ SWS ] ) . These change produce consistent diurnal pattern cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) document murine model human . By good understand sleep-wake relationship investigator hope identify sleep disorder accelerate progression AD elderly ( demonstrated multiple epidemiological study ) , turn , identify novel therapeutic target AD prevention . The purpose study elucidate soluble amyloid beta ( Aβ ) level brain influence sleep-wake cycle human , test directionality relationship sleep disruption experiment . The investigator test two model . The first model test , prior amyloid deposition , brain soluble Aβ level may relatively increase elderly two mechanism : ) loss total sleep time SWS occur normal aging ; b ) sleep disturbance Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SDB ) insomnia common late life ( Aim 1 ) . The second model test stage-specific sleep disruption may lead increase CSF Aβ42 level ( Aim 2 ) . A group adult diagnose severe SDB good continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) compliance use test model sleep deprivation experiment use therapeutic CPAP vs. sham CPAP . This project first explore protective effect SWS Aβ42 dynamic group cognitively normal elderly subject well effect acute sleep disruption CPAP withdrawal CSF Aβ42 level well characterize clinical sample severe obstructive SDB patient treatment CPAP . The result study improve understanding nature Aβ diurnal pattern brain consequence full night sleep disruption well sleep disruption specific stage sleep .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluations procedure perform participant : Aim 1 Subjects newly enrol normal elderly normal elderly recruit R01HL118624-01 evaluate accord study protocol . Visit 1 : During visit , participant undergo complete physical exam , neurological examination , psychiatric interview , sleep interview , neuropsychological testing , Heart test ( EKG ) , laboratory analysis blood . ( 90cc ) Visit 2 : During visit , participant undergo MRI scan educate complete home monitoring sleep wake cycle actigraphy . Visit 3 : Patients receive one FBB PET/MR scan establish amyloid status . Visit 4 : Patients undergo one night NPSG maze task prior subject ' schedule morning LP collection CSF ( 15 cc ) . Aim 2 All subject receive complete evaluation ( outline ) . Visit 1 visit 2 use screen subject inclusion . Visit 1 : During visit participant undergo complete physical exam , neurological examination , psychiatric interview , sleep interview , psychometric testing , heart testing ( EKG ) , laboratory analysis blood . ( 90cc ) Visit 2 : During visit patient undergo MRI scan educate complete home monitoring sleep wake cycle actigraphy . Visit 3 : Patients undergo one night NPSG MSSM either consistent use CPAP use Sham CPAP model discontinuation . Approximately , 10 hour sleep onset participant LP collection CSF . They also complete 3D Visual Maze task night lab assessment morning , right LP ( 15 cc ) . Visit 4 : Patients undergo one night NSPG MSSM either consistent use CPAP use Sham CPAP model discontinuation . Approximately , 10 hour sleep onset participant LP collection CSF . They also complete 3D Visual Maze task night lab assessment morning , right LP ( 15 cc ) Incidental finding study procedure ( except CSF analyse ApoE genotyping ) communicate study subject Study Physician .</detailed_description>
