	<brief_summary>This research study liver transplant recipient respective living donor . The purpose study : 1 . To see safe liver recipient receive one dose donor reactive T regulatory cell ( Tregs ) 2 . To see Tregs allow liver recipient take less , completely stop medication normally take receive organ transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Alloantigen Reactive Tregs ( darTregs ) Calcineurin Inhibitor ( CNI ) Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doctors give drug call immunosuppressant ( IS ) people receive liver transplant . IS must take every day prevent body injure transplant liver process call rejection . Liver transplant recipient usually take drug rest life . These drug harmful side effect . Researchers look way keep transplant liver work normally little IS medication possible . Finding way lower stop medication allow liver recipient avoid unwanted side effect . Another area research look blood cell work reject accept organ transplant . Studies show recipient 's cell , call T regulatory cell ( Tregs ) , may play part accept transplant liver prevent rejection . A recipient 's Tregs grown laboratory increase number . Exposing recipient 's Tregs liver donor 's cell stimulate Tregs recognize liver donor grow vigorously . Giving `` donor reactive '' Tregs back transplant recipient vein ( intravenously ) might allow liver transplant recipient take low dos IS , perhaps stop altogether , without reject liver . The study team collect information Treg infusion , liver test drug dos IS withdrawal , problem may arise study . Blood , liver tissue , buccal ( cheek ) cell collect research test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study Enrollment Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enrollment : 1 . Able understand provide inform consent 2 . Have receive primary , solitary , live donor liver transplant 24 month le 84 month ago 3 . Have live donor willing consent one time blood draw 100 mLs enable manufacture Donor Alloantigen Reactive Regulatory T cell ( darTregs ) 4 . Eighteen 70 year age time study entry/consent 5 . Liver function test ( LFT ) result : Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) consistently &lt; 60 U/L either alkaline phosphatase consistently &lt; 150 U/L Gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) consistently &lt; 60 U/L 6 . Currently receive Calcineurin Inhibitor ( CNI ) 12 hour trough level consistently &lt; 6.0 ng/mL tacrolimus ; &lt; 150 ng/mL cyclosporine 7 . Currently receive CNI monotherapy CNI one following : 1 . Prednisone : maximum dose 5mg daily 2 . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) : maximum dose 500 mg administer twice daily Cellcept 360mg twice daily Myfortic . 8 . Female male participant reproductive potential must agree use effective method birth control duration study . 9 . If history Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , liver transplantation ( LT ) recipient : 1. αfetoprotein ( AFP ) less 100 μg/L time transplant AND 2 . Explanted liver : tumor burden within Milan criterion without macro microvascular invasion without lesion poorly differentiate HCC without cholangiocarcinoma morphology 3 . Risk Estimation Tumor Recurrence After Transplant ( RETREAT ) Score le equal 3 10 . If history HCC , time enrollment , subject must also : 1 . Be 36 month posttransplant AND 2 . Without evidence recurrent HCC define : AFP within normal limit perform laboratory ; Confirmatory chest CT Confirmatory CT MRI abdomen pelvis . 11 . If history hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , recipient must : 1 . Cured HCV define achieve Sustained virologic response ( SVR ) great equal six month end treatment 2 . HCV RNA negative time study enrollment Study Enrollment Participants meet criterion eligible study enrollment : 1 . Transplant liver disease secondary autoimmune disease ( e.g . autoimmune hepatitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , primary biliary cirrhosis ) 2 . Matched human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) DR loci donor 3 . Organ , tissue cell transplant prior primary solitary living donor liver transplant 4 . For subject hepatitis B , detectible hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA 5 . History malignancy within 5 year enrollment . History adequately treat insitu cervical carcinoma and/or skin cancer ( basal squamous cell ) permit . 6 . Serologic evidence human immunodeficiency 1 2 infection 7 . Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) seronegativity ( EBV naïve ) live donor EBV seropositive 8 . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) seronegativity ( CMV naïve ) live donor CMV seropositive 9 . Calculated Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) less 50 mL/min/1.73m^2 time enrollment 10 . An episode Acute Rejection ( AR ) within one year enrollment 11 . Systemic illness require likely require recurrent chronic immunosuppression ( IS ) drug use 12 . Any chronic condition anticoagulation safely interrupt liver biopsy 13 . Positive pregnancy test 14 . Participation study involve investigational drug regimen precede year 15 . Any condition , investigator 's judgment , increase risk darTregs infusion prevents safe trial participation 16 . Unwilling unable adhere study requirement procedures 17 . Screening liver biopsy follow histological criterion , determine read central pathologist . darTregs Infusion Subjects must meet criterion receive darTregs infusion : 1 . Stable liver test , define ALT either alkaline phosphatase GGT either within normal limit OR &lt; \=1.5 X baseline 2 . No detectible circulate EBV CMV DNA prior Treg infusion , assessed time PBMC collection manufacture 3 . For subject hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , detectible circulate HBV DNA , assess time PBMC collection manufacture 4 . Able understand provide inform consent . darTregs Infusion Subjects meet criterion eligible darTregs infusion : 1 . Diagnosis AR initiation IS withdrawal 2 . Any vaccination give within 28 day prior Treg collection Treg production 3 . Receipt vaccination within 14 day prior Treg infusion 4 . Unacceptable darTregs product 5 . Positive pregnancy test 6 . Clinical evidence viral syndrome le 7 day prior darTregs infusion . Inclusion Criteria Resuming IS Withdrawal darTregs Infusion : Subjects eligible resume IS withdrawal darTregs infusion criterion meet : 1 . Subject receive least 100 x 10^6 darTregs 2 . ALT either alkaline phosphatase GGT remain within normal limit &lt; \= 1.5 x baseline darTregs infusion 3 . For subject elevate liver test define , local pathology read liver biopsy 610 day darTregs infusion without AR accord Banff criterion 4 . IS withdrawal resumes later 14 day darTregs infusion 5 . Site principal investigator determines acceptable study subject resume IS withdrawal .</criteria>
