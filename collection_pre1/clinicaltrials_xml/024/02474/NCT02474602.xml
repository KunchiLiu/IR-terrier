	<brief_summary>The effect phototherapy widely study research group . The investigator know positive result light application improve muscle performance delay fatigue . However , study show itsÂ´ effect muscular training . Therefore , aim study assess effect phototherapy apply different time 12 week strength training . For , 48 volunteer , healthy male , 18 35 year old recruit perform strength train protocol anterior muscle thigh development . Volunteers perform train protocol twice week 12 week . There assessed isometric peak torque isokinetic dynamometer , 1-repetition maximum test leg extension leg press machine bilateral thigh perimetry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phototherapy Applied Association With Strength Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical , randomize , control placebo double-blind study . Forty-eight participant perform strength training protocol . Subjects practice protocol train 80 % load , measure 1-repetition maximum test . The training protocol consist perform 5 set 10 repetition , twice week , employ leg extension leg press machine . Phototherapy , active placebo , apply 6 different point anterior muscle thigh training session . Only one investigator , participate phase assessment trainings session , know program active placebo phototherapy device . Randomisation carry simple draw lot ( A , B , C , D ) first visit . The phototherapy unit emit sound regardless program use , active placebo . Either strength training last 12 week assessment perform baseline , 4 , 8 12 week . There evaluate maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) , bilateral thigh perimetry 1-repetition maximum test ( 1-RM ) .</detailed_description>
