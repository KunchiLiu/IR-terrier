	<detailed_description>The blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) specialize interface allow unique environment neuro-glia network . BBB dysfunction common brain disorder . However , mechanism underlie BBB open poorly understood . The investigator suggest novel mechanism modulate BBB integrity therapeutic implication patient glioblastoma multiforme . The Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) noninvasive method stimulate cortical motor neuron scalp skull capable induce electrical current depolarize neuron focal brain area use rapidly change electromagnetic field generate coil place scalp . The objective study evaluate safety effect deep TMS ( dTMS ) barrier integrity 20 patient malignant glial tumor ( glioblastoma multiforme ) . BBB permeability quantify use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) . Permeability change compare two DCE-MRI scan perform immediately `` real '' `` sham '' dTMS , randomly assign within one week . Design study : Randomized double-blind crossover study . Patients present two consecutive day order receive dTMS follow DCE-MRI . Subjects randomize two group : first group treat real-dTMS ( first day ) sham-dTMS ( second day ) ; second group treat sham-dTMS ( first day ) real-dTMS ( second day ) . At end session dTMS patient undergo MRI exam . Enrolled patient : twenty patient glioblastoma multiforme treat craniotomy gross tumor resection maximal debulking least year prior study treat standard post-operative radiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy . dTMS deliver 1 Hz , anterior periphery resect tumor bed use Hesed-coil ( H-coil ) ( Brainsway Ltd. , Jerusalem , Israel ) . Sham stimulation deliver sham coil place helmet able produce similar sound scalp sensation .</detailed_description>
