	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control trial perioperative use octreotide patient PD pancreatic periampullary tumour May 2015 April 2016 Gastroenterology surgical center , Mansoura University , Egypt . The primary outcome study effect perioperative use octreotide rate development postoperative pancreatic fistula patient PD pancreatic periampullary tumour . The secondary outcome postoperative overall complication , mortality , duration hospital length stay cost-benefit relationship perioperative use octreotide . Enrolled patient randomize either octreotide placebo group . The randomization process do use closed envelop method withdrawn nurse pancreaticoduodenectomy . Patients octreotide group receive sandostatin 100ug SC every 8 hour daily star day operation postoperative day 7 . Patients placebo group receive saline administer similar manner .</detailed_description>
