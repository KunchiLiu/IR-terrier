	<detailed_description>The propose study evaluate outcomes Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient treated unilateral deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) ; patient consent study randomized standard care experimental group . The study occur two phase . Phase 1 ( in-clinic test iPad base decision support system ) occur 3rd quarter year 1 2nd quarter year 3 . Phase 2 ( in-home test home health nurse ) occur 1st quarter year 3 4th quarter year 4 . Phase I : Both standard care experimental group medically evaluate identically , program different group experimental group program use iPad . Patients control experimental group monitor frequency University Florida ( UFL ) University Utah ( UU ) clinic . Data safety monitoring responsibility Dr. Okun ( MPI ) Dr. Lauren Schrock ( Co-I ) protocol involve minimal risk minor increase minimal risk conduct single site . We anticipate single nurse site perform DBS programming . Phase II : Patients experimental group evaluate program home health nurse patient 's home setting . Neurological exam clinic perform first post-operative DBS programming session 6 month later ( propose end experimental period patient ) . During intervening period , DBS program patient evaluation perform home health nurse . phase , data safety monitoring conduct DSMB , meet regularly review case ensure safety . All subject recruit directly UFL UU clinic system , subject oral write informed consent participation study . We anticipate two home health register nurse ( RNs ) perform DBS program phase 2 .</detailed_description>
