	<brief_summary>The vascular pathologic basis diabetic foot include arterial obstruction micro-circulation defects.The late technology arterial reconstruction rebuild blood flow anterior , posterior tibial artery peroneal artery.Endothelial progenitor cell prove integrate damage vascular endothelium improve vasculogenesis vitro animal experiment.Therefore endothelial progenitor cell suppose improve micro-circulation status diabetic foot patients.In trial , investigator recuit diabetic foot patient infrapopliteal arterial obstructive disease , treat autologous endothelial progenitor cell intraluminal intervention , observe therapeutic efficacy compare single intraluminal intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Endothelial Progenitor Cells Treatment Diabetic Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design The study prospective , non-random¬ized trial conduct 2 center east China - Tenth People 's Hospital Tongji University Nanjing First Hospital . The ethic committee center approve protocol , patient provide write informed consent . All patient enrol assigned CD133+ cell treatment group ( CD133+ group ) control group volition . This study evaluate efficacy immune-regulatory impact intra-arterial infusion autologous CD133+ cell diabetic subject PAD . Patient enrollment group Diabetic PAD patient age ≥18 year Rutherford categories 2 5 include ass eligibility study . All patient , agree participate study , could voluntary choose whether receive autologous CD133+ progenitor cell treatment . In study , CD133+cells use stimulate angiogenesis reconstruct efficient microvascular blood supply , therefore similar hemodynamic status main branch essential meet homogeneityin group patient entry . The candidate , fail intraluminal revascularization infra-aorta ( iliac femoral-popliteal ) 1 infra-popliteal ( anterior/posterior tibial , fibular ) artery affect limb , would exclude study . Other exclusion criterion follow : ① Hemoglobin &lt; 10 mg/dl , ② creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min , ③ previous history stem/progenitor cell therapy , ④ paralysis central neural system disease , ⑤ accidental amputation bone fracture target limb trauma entry , ⑥ stop anti-platelet medication entry , ⑦ smoke re-smoking entry , ⑧ malignant tumor . Treatment infra-aorta &amp; infra-popliteal artery lesion Computed tomographic angiography ( CTA ) perform firstly analyze condition vascular lesion digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) perform precisely identify lesion infra-aorta infra-popliteal artery treatment . The treatment infra-aorta artery lesion restrictedly perform intraluminal technique ( balloon dilation and/or stent implantation ) nevertheless grade lesion accord TASC II classification . The arterial sheath introduce contralateral femoral artery , revascularization target limb accomplish antegrade approach . After previous procedure , lesion infra-popliteal artery re-evaluated DSA . By mean balloon dilation , least one anterior/posterior tibial fibular artery achieve obvious direct blood supply foot . The goal procedures completely restore normal main trunk hemodynamic status target limb . Autologous CD133+ cell collection preparation After successful revascularization infra-aorta infra-popliteal procedure , 100ml peripheral blood collect femoral artery sheath patient send East China Stem Cell Bank CD133+ cell sort enrichment . Mononuclear cell separate whole blood density gradient centrifugation Ficoll separate medium , CD133+ cell select use magnetic-activated cell sort . The selected cell mixed 50ml sodium chloride injection , contain human albumin heparin sodium blood bag , send back hospital store 4℃ . All collection prepare procedure finish within 6 hour . The selected cell also need take quality test , otherwise cell would discard source patient would exclude study . The quality standard follow : cell number ≥ 1×107 , visible precipitate cell suspension , viable cell ≥90 % , endotoxin ≤ 2EU/ml Cell Infusion Procedure A catheter introduce popliteal artery target limb tibial plateau level . The CD133+ cell suspension draw 50ml syringe infuse catheter injection pump time 30 minute . For control group , 50ml cell-free sodium chloride injection contain human albumin heparin sodium infuse catheter placebo . Medication life style change Both group ask receive continuous medication diabetes , hyperlipidemia hypertension advice specialize physician . Anti-platelet treatment 100mg enteric-coated aspirin 75mg clopidogrel daily , well statins administration stabilize arterial plaque , also demand . Besides medication , candidate restrictedly ask quit smoking entry . Follow-up Endpoints The patient follow 18 month . The primary endpoint define aggravation ulcer ( develop new large deep ulcer ) amputation ( metatarsal level ) . The ulcer heal amputation status observe monthly . The change Rurtherford classification , TcPO2 dorsum pedis ABI record evaluate blood perfusion limb 6 18 month second endpoint . As proven , stem cell promote angiogenesis stimulation endothelial cell proliferation , migration , survival paracrine high level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) [ 9 ] . In addition regenerative property , stem cell immune-regulatory capacity induce immunosuppressive effect series situation [ 10 ] . Human stem cell find suppress Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) expression activate macrophage , play key role inflammatory response wound heal [ 11 ] . Thus , serum concentration VEGF IL-6 1 , 2 , 4 week CD133+ cell infusion test evaluate pro-angiogensis immunoregulatory impact procedure duration .</detailed_description>
