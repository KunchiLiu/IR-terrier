	<brief_title>Processed Meat Brain Regions Related Reward Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mesolimbic dopaminergic system brain , converge nucleus accumbens ( part striatum ) , play central role reward craving , system appear mediate hedonic food response . In rodent study , extracellular concentration dopamine metabolite nucleus accumbens increase consumption highly palatable food standard rodent feed pellet . Furthermore , microinjections opiate nucleus accumbens increase food intake reward value food . Clinical study use functional brain imaging report great activation nucleus accumbens region striatum obese lean individual view consume palatable , high-calorie food . Of particular interest , striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability significantly low obese individual nonobese match control , raise possibility overeating may compensate low dopaminergic activity . The recurrent activation striatum may down-regulate dopamine availability heighten drive overeat . However , information exact effect different food nutrient mesolimbic dopaminergic system miss . Preliminary finding lead project A positive association high consumption total red meat , especially processed meat , incidence T2D demonstrate . Previous study support concept increase oxidative stress may play important role T2D manifestation . Dietary fat quality propose critical factor . Several study suggest high intake saturate fatty acid naturally present meat contributes risk glucose intolerance . In intervention study , human suffer metabolic syndrome consuming diet rich saturate fat display higher oxidative stress marker postprandially . It clear saturate fatty acid per se via increase oxidative stress marker may activate mesolimbic dopaminergic system . In contrast , intervention trial ( include ) demonstrate great improvement insulin sensitivity , glycemic control reduction oxidative stress marker T2D patient consume vegetarian diet compare conventional diabetic diet . The effect vegetarian diet mesolimbic dopaminergic system study yet . Aims priority project The purpose study 1 . Compare effect two isocaloric meal ( process meat hamburger vs. vegetarian sandwich ) response postprandial period use functional brain image reward circuitry implicate food motivation energy balance patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , obese subject healthy control . 2 . Characterize pathophysiological mechanism action different meal obese T2D subject vs. healthy control ( serum concentration glucose , FFA , IRI , C-peptide , gastrointestinal hormone , oxidative stress marker ) Hypothesis 1 . Obese T2D subject relative lean healthy control show great activation gustatory cortex somatosensory region response intake process meat hamburger ( vs. vegetarian sandwich ) . However , also show decreased activation caudate nucleus response consumption process meat hamburger ( vs. vegetarian sandwich ) . 2 . Changes serum concentration glucose , FFA , IRI , C-peptide , gastrointestinal hormone oxidative stress marker involve gut-brain axis signal . The investigator hypothesise find association postprandial change serum concentration FFA postprandial change activation gustatory cortex somatosensory region brain . The actual need study The pandemic obesity diabetes especially western country call high-quality research relevant action . A good understanding pathophysiological mechanism stimulation brain region involve reward crave response process meat , one significant present risk factor obesity type 2 diabetes , need order develop effective preventive therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
