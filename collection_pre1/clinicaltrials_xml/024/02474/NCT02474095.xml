	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study alternate schedule acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( ALTENS ) treat dry mouth ( xerostomia ) cause radiation therapy ( RT ) patient head neck cancer . ALTENS procedure mild electric current apply certain acupuncture point body may help relieve dry mouth cause RT improve quality life . It yet know whether give ALTENS frequently work well standard ALTENS treat dry mouth cause RT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether ALTENS treatment use four-times weekly schedule 6 week reduce overall xerostomia burden , use University Michigan 15-item Xerostomia-related Quality Life Scale ( XeQoLS ) , compare standard ALTENAS schedule twice-weekly 12 week , 15 month start ALTENS treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether ALTENS treatment use four-times weekly schedule 6 week reduce overall xerostomia burden , use University Michigan 15-item Xerostomia-related Quality Life Scale ( XeQoLS ) , compare standard ALTENS schedule twice-weekly 12 week , 6 , 9 , 15 , 21 month start ALTENS treatment . II . Examine benefit ALTENS treatment use four-times weekly schedule 6 week overall quality life , use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality life questionnaire , QLQ-C30 , include questionnaire module specific head neck cancer ( QLQ-H &amp; N35 ) , compare standard ALTENS schedule twice-weekly 12 week , 6 , 9 , 15 , 21 month start ALTENS treatment . III . To compare toxicity treatment schedule use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE Version 4.0 ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo ALTENS deliver via Codetron machine four time weekly ( QIW ) 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo ALTENS deliver via Codetron machine twice-weekly ( BIW ) 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 9 , 15 , 21 month .</detailed_description>
