	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose onalespib give together paclitaxel treat patient triple negative breast cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced ) . Onalespib work block proper processing protein important cancer growth . This result inability proteins work properly . Paclitaxel kill breast cancer cell interfere ability divide . Giving onalespib together paclitaxel may better treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Onalespib Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) onalespib ( AT13387 ) combination paclitaxel patient advanced triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . II . To determine toxicity profile ( base Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version [ v. ] 4.03 ) combination AT13387 combination paclitaxel patient advance TNBC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect AT13387 pharmacokinetics paclitaxel study patient population . II . To determine effect paclitaxel pharmacokinetics AT13387 study patient population . III . To observe anti-tumor activity determine overall response rate ( partial response + complete response ) , response duration progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study onalespib . SAFETY RUN-IN : Patients receive onalespib intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -7 . TREATMENT : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive onalespib IV 1 hour begin day 8 15 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
