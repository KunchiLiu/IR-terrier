	<brief_title>Absorb BVS vs. Drug Coated Balloon Treatment Of ISR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized-controlled trial Absorb® Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) vs. Sequent Please® drug coat balloon all-comers population in-stent-restenosis ( ISR ) . The patient randomize 1:1 fashion investigator intend include 150 patient . All patient present ISR require percutaneous coronary intervention eligible include study . This include patient stable angina present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . The primary objective study demonstrate superiority Absorb® bioresorbable scaffold compare Sequent Please® Drug Coated Balloon treat patient In-Stent-Restenosis regard primary endpoint - angiographic late lumen loss 9 month follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male Female , age 18 year . Diagnosed ISR require percutaneous coronary intervention : visual diameter stenosis &gt; 70 % and/or Fractional Flow Reserve &lt; 0.81 and/or noninvasive test demonstrate ischemia . This reallife population instent restenosis beside typical stable patient ISR include ACS patient thrombus contain lesion , patient multivessel disease , patient ISR noninfarct related artery , ISR bare metal stent ( BMS ) , drug elute stent ( DES ) bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ) , ISR lesion previously treat plain old balloon angioplasty ( POBA ) , drug elute balloon ( DEB ) additional stent implantation . Double antiplatelet therapy duration least 12 month consider possible time intervention The participant may enter study interventionist doubt able deliver implant Absorb scaffold ( e.g . highly calcified lesion ) . Patients contraindication use DEB ( SeQent Please ) BVS ( Absorb ) specify instruction use able participate study . Women childbearing potential must negative result pregnancy test must use effective contraception method least 12 month study procedure .</criteria>
