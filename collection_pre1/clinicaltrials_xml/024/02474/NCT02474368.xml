	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Stereotactic Boost/Treatment Recurrent Metastatic Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . Stereotactic body radiation develop image treatment capability radiation treatment machine become accurate precise . Like standard radiation therapy , stereotactic body radiation kill tumor cell cause small break DNA cell . In research study , investigator look high dose stereotactic radiation give safely either alone , 'boost dose ' combination standard radiation chemotherapy . Because stereotactic radiation precise , investigator test whether use increase dose primary tumor without significantly increase side effect ; goal improve likelihood kill tumor , case , complete course radiation shorter amount time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : All cohort : Participants must pathologic cancer diagnosis . No active malignancy within past 2 year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Only patient 18 year older eligible . There upper age limit patient must able medically tolerate regimen . Adverse event data currently unavailable use SBRT participant &lt; 18 year age , thus child exclude study . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( see Appendix A ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Cohort 1 ( reirradiation patient head neck cancer gross unresectable disease ) : History radiation head neck area ( defined clavicle ) great 6 month previous Pathologically proven recurrent disease second primary ( squamous cell carcinoma head neck , nasopharyngeal cancer , salivary gland cancer , thyroid cancer ) within head neck region , deem unresectable resect gross residual disease remain ( determine either operative/pathology report postsurgical imaging ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL ( microliter ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt; ↓1,500/mcL ( microliter ) Platelets ≥100,000/mcL ( microliter ) Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ( SGOT ) ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ( SGPT ) ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal Cohort 2 ( patient metastatic disease targetable lesion within head neck ) : Pathologically proven solid tumor ( lymphomas exclude ) evidence metastatic disease ( include nodal disease ) Measurable disease within head neck region , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm &lt; 60 mm neck CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measurable disease . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . SBRT target size &gt; 6 cm maximum diameter ( great 100 cc volume ) . Participants may receive study agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study radiotherapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother SBRT , breastfeed discontinue mother treated SBRT . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy ; diagnose treat within past 2 year cervical cancer situ basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential interaction conventional radiotherapy , SBRT antiretroviral medication . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients plan receive following medication : Granulocyte stimulate factor ( GCSF ) Bevacizumab Cyclosporine Antitumor necrosis factor agent Amifostine</criteria>
