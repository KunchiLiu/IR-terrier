	<brief_title>Shedding , Immunogenicity Safety Quadrivalent Live Intranasal Influenza Vaccine ( QLAIV ) HIV-infected Children Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>QLAIV intranasal vaccine work use 4 different attenuate strain influenza virus replicate nose stimulate immune response recipient protect infected one strain influenza future . A couple study show increase duration virus remain nose immunocompromised people . Those study do use trivalent vaccine , would like evaluate quadrivalent vaccine , still need additional data help understand duration shed . If shed prolong HIV-infected child young adult , would important know contact individual immunocompromised . Shedding measure look influenza RNA nasopharyngeal swab take baseline , 2-5 day , 7-10 day 14-21 day intranasal immunization . The live-attenuated influenza vaccine show increased effectiveness child stimulate immune system different way inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV QIV ) . In study , opportunity compare immunogenicity QLAIV , measure baseline 14-21 dayspost-vaccination , HIV-infected uninfected child , adolescent young adult . Although prior study LAIV HIV-infected immunocompromised child adult show increase serious adverse event , safety actively monitor first 30-45 day study-specific questionnaire administer clinic phone visit ask subject keep diary side effect . Safety monitor passively throughout course study .</detailed_description>
