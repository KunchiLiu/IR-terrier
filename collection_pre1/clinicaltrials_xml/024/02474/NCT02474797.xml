	<brief_title>Ultrasound Diaphragmatic Thickening Monitor Its Dysfunction Patients With Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational Severe sepsis septic shock represent first cause death ICU ( 42 % 60 % mortality rate ) . Sepsis define alteration cellular function , immune dysregulation , coagulation metabolism disorder , follow Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) . Among different affected organ , skeletal muscle highlight . Proteolysis increase , proteosynthesis decrease mitochondrial dysfunction lead overall muscular cell alteration ( sarcolemma , sarcoplasmic reticulum contractile protein ) . These mechanism induce reduction skeletal muscle mass skeletal muscle-specific force generation . Diaphragm could first muscle affect sepsis ( 1 ) . Sepsis primary risk factor diaphragmatic dysfunction . Diaphragm could consider organ alter sepsis ( 2 ) . Diaphragmatic dysfunction associate sepsis severity pejorative prognosis . Its assessment become important issue order evaluate patient severity status , monitor diaphragm recovery adjust treatment . One study evaluate diaphragmatic function Magnetic Phrenic Nerve Stimulation mechanically ventilate patient ( 3 ) one Needle Electromyography diaphragm patient prolong wean mechanical ventilation ( 4 ) . But study assess diaphragmatic function ultrasound measure Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction patient severe sepsis septic shock , mechanically ventilate . Ultrasonography noninvasive , ionization free , feasible rapidly bedside thus regularly use diaphragm assessment ( 5 ) . The diaphragmatic thickening fraction ( DTF ) zone apposition ( 6 ) allow assess thicken capacity diaphragm inspiration contraction capacity . It accurate reproducible outcome measure diaphragmatic dysfunction assessment . A DTF &lt; 20 % indicate diaphragmatic dysfunction ( 7 ) . We hypothesize acute diaphragmatic abnormality present ICU septic patient prognosis factor patient severity . Aim study assess diaphragmatic function DTF ultrasound measure patient severe sepsis septic shock , mechanically ventilate , hospitalize ICU order determinate diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency , prognosis value associate factor . Objectives Primary To estimate diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency measure Ultrasound DTF ICU septic patient . Secondary : - To determine DTF predictor intubation ; - To determine DTF predictor successful wean mechanical ventilation subgroup mechanically ventilated patient ; - To monitor change DTF ICU hospitalization ; - To determine risk factor diaphragmatic dysfunction ; - To determine associated factor diaphragmatic dysfunction . Methods Design This prospective study 14-bed medical surgical ICU include 50 consecutive patient severe sepsis septic shock . Data collection Demographic data , antecedent , severity score , organ dysfunction-related variable , physiologic data , presence sepsis , presence mechanical ventilation medication prospectively record inclusion ( ICU admission severe sepsis/septic shock severe sepsis/septic shock occur ICU hospitalization ) . Ultrasound DTF , severity score , organ dysfunction-related variable , physiologic data , presence septic shock , medication , presence mechanical ventilation prospectively record day ICU hospitalization . Duration mechanical ventilation , number fail extubation , decision perform tracheostomy , ICU Hospital stay , ICU Hospital mortality also record . Recruitment Patients recruit 14-bed medical surgical ICU present inclusion criterion . All patient relative provide write consent participate . Diaphragm thicken assessment All patient evaluate semi-recumbent position . Ultrasound perform use ultrasound system equip 10 megahertz linear probe . Daily Measure Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction ( DTF ) perform trained physiotherapist . Physiotherapist ( A . LE NEINDRE ) train six month measure well-trained Physician . DTF measure day follow ( 7 ) : probe place intercostal space mid axillary line anterior axillary line , 0.5cm 2 centimeter costodiaphragmatic sinus . With B-mode diaphragm observe like structure make three distinct layer : nonechogenic central layer border two echogenic layer : pleural line ( internal layer ) peritoneum ( external layer ) . The patient instruct perform breathing total lung capacity exhale residual volume , possible ( awake patient ) . Awakening status record . Mechanically ventilated patient evaluated Pressure Support ( PS ) mode ( daily PS mode research patient Controlled Ventilation ) , low PS level tolerate . PS level record . DTF measure perform B-mode use follow formula : TF ( % ) = [ ( end-inspiration thickness - end-expiration thickness ) / ( end-expiration thickness ) x 100 ] . Three consecutive measure perform . Video file record DTF estimate independently second train operator ( Dr F. PHILIPPART ) , unaware patient condition . The good value three measure retain . Diaphragmatic dysfunction define like DTF &lt; 20 % ( 7 ) . Assessment DTF reproducibility Twenty recording ( twenty separate patient ) randomly select study assess analyzer reproducibility . The set record analyzed twice Ultrasound Performer ( A . LE NEINDRE ) ass intra-analyzer reproducibility separately two different Ultrasound Performers ( A . LE NEINDRE F. PHILIPPART ) ass inter-analyzer reproducibility . Statistical Analysis Diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency define proportion patient DTF &lt; 20 % . It express percentage 95 % Confidence Interval . Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis perform assess DTF ability discriminate patient intubate . ROC curve analysis also use discriminate mechanically ventilate patient fail wean success . DTF analyze continuous variable univariate linear regression model use identify factor associate high low DTF value . Multivariate analysis perform use forward logistic regression process take account potential associate factor diaphragm dysfunction . Each potential risk factor diaphragm dysfunction ( DTF &lt; 20 % ) evaluate univariate model ( Student Mann-Whitney U test continuous variable depend distribution ; chi-square test Fisher exact test categorical variable depend size ) , multivariate analysis perform . For comparison , P value less equal 0.05 consider statistically significant . Impact Diaphragmatic dysfunction ICU hospital mortality , institution mechanical ventilation , fail wean form mechanical ventilation , tracheostomy rate assess . Impact Diaphragmatic dysfunction ICU hospital mortality evaluate use Kaplan-Meier survival function estimate . Expected result We expect measure DTF allow identify patient severe sepsis septic shock diaphragmatic dysfunction . It would also estimate diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency ultrasound measure warrant use routinely bedside . We expect DTF help characterize degree severity septic patient new index able predict intubation population . As previous study show population , DTF could predict success extubation mechanically ventilate septic population . It would another tool monitor evolution organ failure . A second study conduct order evaluate new strategy manage septic patient risk diaphragmatic dysfunction ( Inspiratory Muscle Training ) use DTF predictive index intubation . Organization project Number Participants This pilot study aim establish diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency , prognosis associate factor patient severe sepsis septic shock . We wish 18 month maximal duration study . Considering recruit capacity ICU previous study population include 50 consecutive patient .</detailed_description>
