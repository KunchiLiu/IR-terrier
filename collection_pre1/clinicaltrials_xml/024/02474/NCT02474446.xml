	<brief_summary>The investigator want make sure people get right dose Vitamin D treatment .

	<brief_title>Getting Vitamin D Dosing Right</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Department Health Chief Medical Officer identify vitamin D deficiency key area interest concern public health . The main function vitamin D enable dietary calcium absorb intestine . Low level vitamin D lead diseases bone rickets osteomalacia link high risk fracture bone old woman osteoporosis . Vitamin D level may affect skin colour , body mass index ( BMI ) , lifestyle environment someone live , genetic makeup . Vitamin D level tend low people higher BMI / darker colour skin skin cover clothing lot vitamin D make action sunlight natural chemical skin . Vitamin D occur naturally diet food like oily fish , also vitamin D give supplement either part multivitamin tablet . There natural variation one person another well system control vitamin D blood level work . Vitamin D circulate bound carrier protein , vitamin D bind protein ( VDBP ) . When vitamin D level measure , vitamin D bound protein `` free '' vitamin D measure . A recent study America show `` free '' vitamin D level ( total vitamin D minus vitamin D bound VDBP ) measure , correlate closely factor help determine blood calcium levels.This variation determine part person 's genetic makeup , recent large study identify specific genetic variation link blood level vitamin D ; vary person 's ethnic origin . At present someone low vitamin D level put increase risk bone problem , course vitamin D treatment give . When investigator assess regular treatment give child recently , find individual develop high blood vitamin D level others n't . They n't know VDBP level affect response treatment vitamin D. Further variation occur distribution vitamin D fat tissue . The investigator measure height weight , waist hip circumference calculate Body Mass Index , body surface area ( BSA ) waist : hip ratio proxy measure fat mass . They also evaluate whether blood saliva test give good information vitamin D level . The information factor affect response vitamin D help clinician choose right dose vitamin D study younger child still grow .</detailed_description>
