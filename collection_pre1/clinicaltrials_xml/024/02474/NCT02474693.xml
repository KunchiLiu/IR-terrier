	<detailed_description>The Centers Disease Control Prevention conduct observational cross-sectional study obtain information amount sodium consume various source ( include sodium process restaurant food , sodium inherent food , salt add table cooking ) examine variability across population subgroup . Data collection include observational component well sub-study design refine accuracy estimate total sodium intake discretionary sodium intake . Information collect three distinct geographic region : 1 ) Minneapolis/St . Paul , Minnesota , 2 ) Birmingham , Alabama , 3 ) Palo Alto , California . Over two-year period , study center location recruit 150 participant ( total N=450 ) . Overall , approximately equal number adult age 18-74 year approximately 10-year age group sex-race group , include white , black , Hispanics , Asians . A sub-study conduct among subgroup 150 participant ( 50 per site ) . University Minnesota serve study coordinate center . After informed consent complete screen process , participant complete personal questionnaire , tap water questionnaire , four 24-hour dietary recall , four qualitative food record . In addition , height weight information participant collect , participant collect duplicate portion cooking/table salt . A participant site also provide water sample analyze produce estimate amount sodium private source tap water . The Salt Sources Study also include sub-study help determine accuracy estimate total sodium intake discretionary salt intake . About 25 participant site use Study Salt 11 day instead household salt , provide additional information base four 24-hour urine collection , four follow-up urine collection questionnaire , three follow-up questionnaire Study Salt use . The Study Salt amount sodium contain small amount lithium , metal find trace amount plant animal excrete urine . Participants instruct use study salt would salt home collect duplicate sample amount use table home cooking . The amount lithium excrete 24-hour urine collection measure assess amount sodium consume discretionary salt use ( salt use table home cooking ) . Results Salt Sources Study use inform public health strategy reduce sodium intake , determine substantial variability source sodium intake exists social demographic subgroup , good inform estimate salt add table use Healthy People 2020 objective related sodium reduction .</detailed_description>
