	<brief_summary>Background Information : Infections cause extended-spectrum β-lactamase ( ESBL ) -producing Escherichia coli become increasingly common owe incorrect use antibiotic cross-transmission healthcare establishment . These give rise major problem standard clinical practice : penicillin cephalosporin use , resistance class antibiotic normally use , fluoroquinolones cotrimoxazole , frequently observe . The current therapeutic strategy involve use carbapenem , represent last effective solution individual level . However , grow use thereof contributing , collectively , development resistance due production carbapenemases , become major public health problem , potential therapeutic dead-end . This observation particularly worry due small number antibiotic agent currently development . Infectious disease specialist microbiologists thus examine alternative agent carbapenems management infection cause ESBL-producing E. coli . One avenue could develop use known agent , already market , active vitro ESBL-producing E. coli , currently recommend indication standard practice due lack conclusive study . Cefoxitin , antibiotic belonging cephamycin group , could thus represent alternative particular interest treatment infection cause ESBL-producing E. coli , help limit use carbapenems . The implementation prospective , randomize , non-inferiority study ertapenem cefoxitin interest methodological perspective . It enable recommendation draw , high level evidence , long-awaited field . Primary objective : To evaluate bacteriological non-inferiority cefoxitin versus imipenem treatment non-severe urinary tract infection ( cystitis ) cause ESBL-producing E. coli susceptible vitro cefoxitin . Secondary objective : - To evaluate clinical non-inferiority cefoxitin versus imipenem treatment non-severe urinary tract infection ( cystitis ) cause ESBL-producing E. coli susceptible vitro cefoxitin . - To evaluate impact cefoxitin imipenem emergence multiresistant bacteria gut flora .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Non-inferiority Cefoxitin Versus Imipenem/Cilastatin Treatment Urinary Tract Infections Caused ESBL-producing Escherichia Coli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Commensal enterobacteriaceae digestive tract , mostly represent E.coli , cause wide range infection urinary tract infection severe bacteraemia . For several year , misuse antibiotic cross-transmission hospital lead emergence Enterobacteriaceae produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases ( ESBL ) . The rise prevalence ESBL estimate 8.2 % healthcare setting 6.2 % community . Carbapenems consider reference treatment ESBL-producing E.coli ( EESBL ) infection . They often remain last effective treatment individual level . But large scale , increase use contributes emergence resistance might soon become major public health issue . Although prevalence ESBL remain low , rate ESBL epidemic French hospital increase hugely since 2004 . This could become cause concern especially antibacterial agent currently development . So infectiologists microbiologist consider alternative carbapenems treat infection cause EESBL , stipulate new recommendation French High Council Public Health Infectious Disease Society America . Older well-known molecule prove effective in-vitro EESBL may option . However due lack conclusive study , 're still recommended case . Cefoxitin , cephamycin antibiotic , may good alternative treatment EESBL infection contribute spare use carbapenems . Originality innovation : Previous study cephamycins show encouraging result , mostly cohort trial retrospective data subset non-randomized study . So randomized prospective non-inferiority study compare ertapenem cefoxitine necessary . If result show non-inferiority cefoxitine versus ertapenem , immediate clinical application ensue lead new recommendation , highly anticipated infectiologists support project via clinical research network . Project feasibility : The pace inclusion calculate base recent data cefoxitine , trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin sensitivity EESBL , 68 % EESBL susceptible céfoxitine resistant trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin . In 2011 , 16 French laboratory , involve EARSS network , isolate 582 EESBL strain blood culture . In university hospital Nancy , 205 EESBL strain isolate urine culture 2012 . The challenge include 250 patient ESBL E.coli positive urine culture , 18 month 20 participate French center , seem highly feasible . Recent data show 68 % EESBL susceptible céfoxitine resistant trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin . In university hospital Nancy , 205 EESBL strain isolate urine culture 2012 . The challenge include 250 patient ESBL E.coli positive urine culture , 18 month 20 participate French center , seem highly feasible . Expected benefit patient and/or public health Immediate benefit expect , individual level wider scale . Indeed patient , use narrow-specturm antibiotic , equivalent efficacy , decrease risk select even highly resistant bacteria EESBL digestive tract , carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae ( CPE ) . A patient colonize CPE high risk develop CPE infection rate recovery low small number antibiotic remain effective . At community level , main challenge preservation carbapenems ( one last family antibiotic still effective treatment ESBL infection ) , restriction usage treatment severe infection . The increase use carbapenems generates high selection pressure enterobacteriaceae result worry increase prevalence CPE . Moreover , remain effective antimicrobial induce high rate side effect . The assessment non-inferiority older , well-known active molecule cefoxitin highly anticipate encouraging research area , especially molecules currently development far market . Title : Non-inferiority study cefoxitin versus imipenem treatment non-severe urinal tract infection ( exclude cystitis ) cause extended spectrum beta-lactamase produce E.Coli susceptible cefoxitin in-vitro Primary objective : show bacteriological non-inferiority cefoxitin versus imipenem treatment non-severe urinary tract infection ( exclude cystitis ) cause extended spectrum beta-lactamase produce E.Coli susceptible cefoxitin in-vitro Secondary objective : - show clinical non-inferiority cefoxitin versus imipenem treatment non-severe urinary tract infection ( exclude cystitis ) cause extended spectrum beta-lactamase produce E.Coli susceptible cefoxitin in-vitro - evaluate impact cefoxitin imipenem emergence multiresistant bacteria digestive flora</detailed_description>
