	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand cancer treatment may affect cancer cell . The research involve genetic , molecular , cellular , immunologic experiment use blood tumor specimen . It hop information gain study lead great understanding castrate-resistant prostate cancer potentially , improvement cancer treatment . This tissue collection protocol require image-guided biopsy metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . The investigator focus enrol patient metastatic CRPC progress receive novel AR-targeted therapeutic abiraterone enzalutamide . This population patient select resistance develop relatively rapidly follow potent inhibitor AR activity mechanism resistance well understood . Without comprehensive analysis mCRPC tumor , investigator never gain full understanding biology drive resistance human disease develop rational co-targeting approach possible .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>History histologically confirm prostate cancer . Patients without histologically confirm prostate cancer eligible treat physician study PI agree patient 's history unambiguously indicative advanced prostate cancer ( e.g . high PSA responsive Androgen Deprivation Therapy . ) Radiographic evidence metastatic disease amenable imageguided biopsy metastatic site . Softtissue well bony metastatic lesion consider acceptable . Patients locally advanced disease ( biopsy would prostatic mass ) eligible . Biopsy newly emerge radiographic metastasis desire preferable biopsy previously exist lesion whenever possible . Platelets &gt; 75,000/μl within 14 day prior biopsy PT INR PTT &lt; 1.5 time institutional ULN within 14 day prior biopsy . Patients warfarin , aspirin , anticoagulant eligible provide deem able tolerate discontinuation anticoagulation one week prior biopsy . Conversion low molecular weight heparin prior biopsy permit per local standard operating procedure , provide agreement regard procedure treat physician , interventional radiologist PI . Castrate level testosterone ( testosterone &lt; 50ng/dL ) within 28 day prior biopsy . Patients significant congenital acquire bleed disorder ( eg von Wildebrand 's disease , acquire bleed factor inhibitor ) eligible . If prior orchiectomy , medical castration therapy must continue study . PSA level obtain within 28 day prior biopsy . Patients currently first generation oral antiandrogens ( flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide ) must progress least 4 week antiandrogen discontinuation . Patient 's disease currently progress ( set testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dl ) , define follow criterion : PSA Progression : PSA level least 2 ng/ml rise least 2 successive occasion , least one week apart . If confirmatory PSA ( # 3 ) value le ( i.e. , # 3b ) screening PSA ( # 2 ) value , additional test rise PSA ( # 4 ) require document progression purpose eligibility . Soft tissue progression : RECIST v1.1 Bone scan progression : appearance ≥ 2 new lesion . Symptomatic progression area radiologically evident diseas One follow criterion must meet : Evidence disease progression ( define ) follow treatment least 2 month abiraterone acetate , enzalutamide , ARN509 base therapy . Enrollment high priority clinical trial conduct WCDT . Examples include trial biopsy obtain abiraterone enzalutamide therapy , follow development resistance agent ( ) . This list maintain lead site . Evidence disease progression ( define ) patient `` aggressive phenotype '' mCRPC least one follow clinical feature Visceral brain metastasis Known small cell neuroendocrine subtypes ( IHC serum marker ) Primary ADT resistance define nadir PSA &gt; 4 ng/dl 7 month primary androgen deprivation ( Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dl . ) Prior chemotherapy Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer allow Age &gt; 18 yr ECOG Performance status 03 ( see appendix A ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document</criteria>
