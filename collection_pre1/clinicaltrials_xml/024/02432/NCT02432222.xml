	<brief_summary>The study use randomize controlled trial test efficacy two intervention ( visual art music ) individual dementia , focus dementia Alzheimer 's type ( DAT ) . Interventions run 10 week dementia day center and/or retirement residence . Participants test intervention battery cognitive , affective , behavioural measure . They compare waitlist control group n't receive intervention . The purpose research twofold : treatment symptom improve quality life disease progression dementia . For primary aim , investigator examine potential art intervention decline function dementia ( memory , mood , behavior ) investigate potential treatment effect . Secondly , quality life measure , aim look beyond disease progression contribute overall positive patient experience . Research indicate need non-pharmacological treatment use first line action dementia symptom development . While , best practice , pharmacological treatment use second-line approach . Note : Music intervention drop prior study initiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Visual Arts Training Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants Older adult age 65 old , male female , normal correct vision hearing . Participants require diagnosis dementia , know comorbid cognitive neurological impairment . Participants randomly allocate one three group 1 . Visual art intervention group 2 . Music intervention group 3 . Waitlist control group ( receive intervention completion test session ) . Data analysis 1 . Mixed 2x3 analysis variance ( ANOVA ) construct , within-subject factor time ( pre-intervention post-intervention ) between-subject factor group ( visual art , music , control ) . 2 . Test confound effect background factor ( socioeconomic status , education level , gender , activity participation ) . 3 . Mediation analyse effect mood cognition behaviour . Procedure The present study randomize control trial assess three group dementia patient : visual art group , music group , non-art waitlist control group . Randomized control trial need dementia research experimental study exist support training causal influence dementia relate decline . Older adult dementia allocate either visual art group , music group , waitlist control group . Using two art form enable u active control group examine specificity observe effect . To address inconsistency methodological issue exist result , current study use rigorous experimental control , allocation concealment , adequate sample size , tester blinding . Based power calculation use effect size previous study , group sixty participant adequately power sample . Participants recruit contact activity administrator dementia retirement residence day program . Attention take prevent attrition , tailor intervention towards participant ' need capacity , involve family caregiver research . Furthermore , intervention assessment conduct participant 's respective care facility . Currently , investigator establish partnership day dementia program Toronto area , negotiate agreement work senior retirement residence day program . Recruiting multiple location randomly assign participant experimental control group help generalizability result . Following previous study , art intervention take place ten week ( one hour per day , two day per week ) . The visual art course draw course focus basic visual art concept ( shape contrast ) music course sing instrumental course focus basic music concept ( rhythm melody ) . Defining train element delineate specific effect different activity cognition , poorly explore area previous study . The visual art music course teach study 's graduate student investigator ( Annalise D'Souza Katherine Matthews ) . Both teacher experience accreditation respective art . Before course , participant ( wait-list control group include ) complete multiple assessment task . Data analyze use mixed analysis variance compare performance participant test session , group . The pre-tests occur one two week begin art course , post-tests occur two week art course finish . Testing occur two day period , one hour per day accommodate participant attention span cognitive load . All task select reliability , validity , suitability population hand . To investigate specific influence art , separate visual auditory/verbal test use measure . Testing course begin early 2015 , run multiple time different location reach targeted sample size , expect start date April , September , January . Participant recruitment course begin April continue December . Based previous discussion dementia day program , attrition admission rate program , attain sixty participant per group December possible investigator continue recruit multiple day program retirement residence . The participant ' involvement study completely voluntary participant caregiver ( substitute consent require ) may choose stop participation time . In event participant withdraws study associate collect data immediately destroy wherever possible . All information participant supply study hold confidence . Confidentiality provide full extent possible law . Hypotheses Predictions outline hypothesis : 1 . Visual art music training offset decline cognitive function ( work memory , long-term memory , selective attention , dual-tasking , task switching ) . . Effects visual art great visual measure cognition effect music great auditory measure 2 . Visual art music training improve mood lessen problematic behavior . 3 . Visual art music training improve overall quality life . 4 . Mood mediate change cognition behaviour Background The present study focus non-pharmacological art intervention person Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia . Arts intervention design implemented investigate effect arts train disease symptomology overall quality life person dementia . Dementia characterize decline cognitive function , accompany loss daily functioning ( DSM-IV , 2000 ) , range cognitive , behavioural , psychological deficit different type dementia . The study use randomize controlled trial test efficacy two art intervention . Arts dementia expert guide intervention design ensure program powerful control . With aims reliability applicability , intervention create tested future researcher apply real-world practitioner . Effects evaluate broad range measure ( affective , cognitive , behavioural . The propose study significant two reason . First , address repeatedly highlight need non-pharmacological intervention treat dementia . Second , look beyond disease treatment alone look also improve overall quality life patient dementia . Non-pharmacological intervention offer great potential mental improvement , experimental research need efficacy establish . A large evidence base demonstrate cognitive benefit art healthy old adult . It uncertain however , whether finding also apply individual dementia . A preliminary study indicate similar benefit find , study report cognitive improvement follow art intervention patient population . In addition , prospective study indicate link dementia cognitively stimulating activity art . For example , support old adult participate stimulating activity also display few incidence dementia Alzheimer 's disease . Research suggest non-pharmacological treatment use first line action dementia , pharmacological treatment serve second-line approach . While non-pharmacological treatment indicate remedial effect , need reliably conduct experiment establish efficacy . Art recreation easy administer , inexpensive non-time consuming . Unlike majority current pharmacological treatment , noninvasive pleasurable activity , maintain personhood individual dementia . Note : Music intervention drop prior study initiation , due insufficient participant recruitment .</detailed_description>
