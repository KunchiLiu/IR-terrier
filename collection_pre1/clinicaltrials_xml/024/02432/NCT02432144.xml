	<brief_title>A Long-Term Open-Label Treatment Extension Study UX003 rhGUS Enzyme Replacement Therapy Subjects With MPS 7</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 ( MPS 7 , Sly syndrome ) ultra-rare ( &lt; 100 case currently identify worldwide ) , chronically debilitate life threaten lysosomal storage disease . It characterize deficiency lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase ( GUS ) , require degradation glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) : dermatan sulfate ( DS ) , chondroitin-6-sulfate ( CS ) heparan sulfate ( HS ) . The GUS deficiency result lysosomal accumulation GAGs multiple tissue organ throughout body numerous clinical sign symptom result tissue damage organ dysfunction . There currently approve treatment MPS 7 . UX003 ( recombinant human beta glucuronidase , rhGUS ) intend long-term enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) treatment MPS 7 via intravenous ( IV ) administration . Ultragenyx conduct treatment extension study ass long-term safety efficacy UX003 treatment subject MPS 7 . Subjects MPS 7 UX003 treatment-na誰ve previously enrol treat UX003 clinical study program eligible enrollment . The study continue 144 week one follow occurs : subject withdraws consent discontinues study , subject discontinue study discretion Investigator Ultragenyx , study terminate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis MPS 7 base leukocyte fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme assay genetic testing . Willing able provide write , sign informed consent , case subject age 18 ( 16 year , depend region ) , provide write assent ( require ) write informed consent legally authorize representative nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure . Willing able comply study procedure . Sexually active subject must willing use acceptable , highlyeffective method contraception participate study 30 day follow last dose . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Baseline willing additional pregnancy test study . Females consider childbearing potential include experience menarche , tubal ligation least one year prior completion primary study , total hysterectomy . For UX003 treatmentna誰ve subject , apparent clinical sign lysosomal storage disease judge Investigator , include least one following : enlarge liver spleen , joint limitation , airway obstruction pulmonary problem , limitation mobility still ambulatory . For UX003 treatmentna誰ve subject , elevate uGAG excretion minimum 2fold normal . For UX003 treatmentna誰ve subject , age 5 year old . If enrol prior UX003 clinical study , subject experience safetyrelated event ( ) prior UX003 clinical study , opinion Investigator sponsor , precludes resume UX003 treatment . Undergone successful bone marrow stem cell transplant degree detectable chimaerism donor cell . Presence history hypersensitivity rhGUS excipients , judgment Investigator , place subject increase risk adverse effect . Pregnant breastfeed Baseline planning become pregnant ( self partner ) time study . Other use UX003 , use investigational product ( drug device combination ) within 30 day prior Baseline , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . Presence condition severity acuity , opinion Investigator , warrant immediate surgical intervention treatment may allow safe study participation . Concurrent disease condition , laboratory abnormality , view Investigator , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study , would interfere study participation introduce additional safety concern .</criteria>
