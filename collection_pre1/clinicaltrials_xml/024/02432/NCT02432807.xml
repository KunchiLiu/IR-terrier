	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Vancomycin Ophthalmic Ointment Patients With Moderate Severe Bacterial Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial conjunctivitis common ocular disease cause various type bacteria include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis ( MRSE ) . External ocular infection cause MRSA MRSE frequently serious rare case may severe enough threaten vision . When ocular infection due resistant organism MRSA/MRSE respond empiric treatment approve antibiotic , treatment option . Vancomycin one treatment option show effective clinical isolates MRSA/MRSE . This study Phase 3 study evaluate safety efficacy vancomycin hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment patient moderate sever Gram-positive bacterial conjunctivitis include MRSA MRSE . Subjects , adenovirus negative , dosed vancomycin hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment placebo ( vehicle ) 4 time daily 7 day evaluate clinical bacterial resolution infection along assessment safety investigational product .</detailed_description>
