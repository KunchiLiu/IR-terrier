	<brief_title>Weight-Bearing Tomosynthesis In Evaluation Foot/AnkIe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal study improve radiologic evaluation foot ankle arthritis . Today 's standard care , radiography , provide limited two-dimensional evaluation joint alignment , arthritic change , posttraumatic change , congenital deformity due overlap bone density . Evaluation even limit post-surgical patient due overlap metallic hardware . Computed tomography ( CT ) , current problem-solving tool , offer `` level-by-level '' three dimensional information , fraught additional cost , additional radiation dose , beam-hardening artifact hardware , need additional equipment . Most importantly , patient weight-bearing conventional CT , therefore mask true extent malalignment arthritic joint space narrowing . At University Washington , physicians attempt overcome last problem perform simulate weight-bearing CT . The study propose alternate solution problem use novel application old method , digital tomosynthesis . Specific aim study 1 ) compare radiography , tomosynthesis , simulated-weight bearing CT ability detect foot/ankle malalignment , 2 ) compare ability three modality detect arthritis change joint space narrowing , osteophytes , subchondral cyst , 3 ) compare ability detect bony deformity acute fracture , old fracture deformity , partial fusion ( post traumatic post surgical ) . Radiographic assessment correlate clinical outcome use clinical note functional outcome Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS ) questionnaire . Successful result initial study potential change practice paradigm image foot ankle arthritis .</detailed_description>
