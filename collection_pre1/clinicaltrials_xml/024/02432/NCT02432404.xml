	<brief_title>Effects Vaginal Contraceptive Ring Vaginal Microbiota Local Immunity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator objective study effect contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) contain estrogen progesterone ( NuvaRing ) vaginal bacteria ( vaginal microbiome ) , local immunity , low genital tract infection woman . Emerging data suggest favorable effect CVR vaginal bacteria , specifically hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus ( LB ) , support vagina influence estrogen . These lactobacilli critical defense infection HIV sexually transmit infection ( STI ) . Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) characterize loss LB instead , overgrowth mix anaerobic bacteria . BV significantly increase risk STI/HIV , include genital herpes cause HSV2 . BV characterize decline protective immunologic mediator ( certain defensins , secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor ( SLPI ) ) increase inflammatory cytokine chemokines , alteration cervical immune cell population activation local immune cell , include T cell . Whether local delivery hormone product like CVR restore lactobacilli protection provide BV STI/HIV unknown . In contrast , contraceptive systemic depot progesterone—commonly use worldwide—may independently increase risk HIV acquisition transmission . The investigator overarch hypothesis NuvaRing contribute reduction BV , healthy marker cervicovaginal immune response decrease rate HSV2 shed . Long-acting vaginal delivery hormonal contraception foundation `` multicomponent prevention '' - example , delivery system combine activity unintended pregnancy , HIV , STI—has become major focus scientist , advocate , funders alike , effect vaginal environment need careful definition broad implementation . The need contraceptive option take urgency evidence indicate systemic hormonal contraception ( primarily injectable , long-acting progestin ) may increase woman 's risk HIV acquisition transmission male sex partner . Lack contraceptive option critical barrier progress towards optimize woman 's reproductive health . Moreover , BV remain major problem woman , cause symptomatic vaginitis confer increase risk adverse outcome pregnancy STI/HIV acquisition . The investigator propose explore hypothesis—supported limited data—that contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) commonly use U.S. , NuvaRing , enhance woman 's genital reproductive health . The investigator propose CVR increase bacteria help vaginal environment protect infection HIV STIs , reduce rate BV , woman already HSV2 , use CVR low HSV2 shed female genital tract . Importantly , CVR acceptability general excellent . Moreover , format drug delivery form vaginal ring also intensely explore use antiretroviral agent ( dapivirine , tenofovir ) mean topical , female-controlled HIV prevention , formulation work several antiretroviral drug sustain delivery NuvaRing format underway . The investigator believe NuvaRing specifically enhance vaginal health hypothesize promote growth Lactobacillus bacteria protect woman infection HIV STI . These bacteria , call L. crispatus L. jensenii , promote adequate level vaginal estrogen . These bacteria maintain low vaginal pH ( &lt; 4.7 ) produce lactic acid . BV occur vaginal lactobacillus replace overgrowth vaginal bacteria ( primarily anaerobes , bacteria live low-oxygen condition ) . BV common cause vaginal complaint reproductive-aged woman . In pregnant woman , BV strongly associate increase risk preterm birth pregnancy-associated infection . In non-pregnant woman , BV increase risk pelvic infection , acquisition multiple STI , include HSV2 HIV . BV may elevate risk several way , include activation local immune cell . Finally , recent data indicate onset menstruation trigger key shift local vaginal bacteria , many woman , may actually precipitate BV . Continuous use NuvaRing ( use four week , replace ) suppress menstruation , increasingly use many woman excellent report acceptability safety . Whether suppression menstruation could suppress BV recurrence know . Although short-term antibiotic therapy improve symptom restores Lactobacillus predominance woman BV , 20 % woman fail routine therapy . In addition , BV recurrence successful therapy rule . Recurrence likely cause failure recolonize vagina desirable lactobacillus , require adequate vaginal estrogenization . In one study , woman use NuvaRing 3 consecutive 28-day cycle high quantity desirable vaginal lactobacillus relative woman use oral contraceptive pill contain 20 μg ethinyl estradiol 100 μg levonorgestrel.15 The NuvaRing release 120 mcg/day ENG ( active metabolite desogestrel , progesterone ) 15 mcg/day ethinyl estradiol ( estrogen component ) . While generally well tolerate , incidence local complaint ( increase vaginal discharge discomfort ) continuous CVR use high report OC user ; thus , risk : benefit ratio approach need careful assessment . Pregnancy also independent risk HIV acquisition transmission , acquisition confers high rate perinatal transmission . However , systemic depot progesterone , commonly use worldwide , may independently increase risk HIV acquisition transmission . Increased HIV risk relate hormonal contraceptive use would global public health importance , give large number woman use method . In recent technical report , World Health Organization note `` expansion contraceptive method mix research relationship hormonal contraception HIV infection essential . '' For reason , , careful study microbiological , clinical , immunologic benefit CVR high scientific public health priority .</detailed_description>
