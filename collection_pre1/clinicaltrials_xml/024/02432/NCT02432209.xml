	<brief_title>Improving Reproductive Fitness Through Pretreatment With Lifestyle Modification Obese Women With Unexplained Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objective An intensive lifestyle modification intervention ( include caloric restriction , use over-the-counter weight loss medication , moderate physical activity track ) design promote weight loss approximately 7 % initial body weight likely achieve good perinatal outcome ( i.e . healthy term normal weight infant ) recommendation standard lifestyle modification moderate physical activity tracking ( base publically available activity recommendation ) obese woman unexplained infertility . Patient Population The population consist 380 obese woman unexplained infertility , age 18-40 year old . Subjects must normal ovulatory function normal ovarian reserve . Additionally , couple major infertility factor : subject least one patent fallopian tube normal uterine cavity , partner total motile sperm count least 5 million least one ejaculate . Study Design This two-arm , multicenter , prospective , randomized clinical trial lifestyle modification program track increased physical activity weight loss ( intensive ) compare recommendation track increased physical activity alone weight maintenance ( standard ) woman obesity unexplained infertility . This 16 week period lifestyle modification follow open label empiric infertility treatment regimen consist three cycle ovarian stimulation oral medication ( clomiphene citrate ( CC ) ) , trigger ovulation human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) . Treatment The intensive lifestyle modification intervention consist caloric restriction ( consumption approximately 1200-1500 kcal/d ) , use over-the-counter weight loss medication ( Alli , brand name Orlistat , gastric lipase inhibitor limit gut fat absorption ) , moderate physical activity ( goal reach 10,000 step day ) . The pretreatment intervention last 16 week design promote weight loss approximately 7 % total body weight . Women standard lifestyle intervention ( standard ) receive publicly available write material promote engagement moderate physical activity target 10,000 step day . Detailed instruction physical activity provide . Participants group receive activity track device ( Fitbit Wireless Activity Tracker ) wireless scale ( Fitbit Aria Wireless Activity Scale ) promote adherence invention allow monitor compliance study personnel . The pretreatment intervention last 16 week . Both group aim activity level 10,000 steps/day , recommendation increase step baseline 500 steps/per week . The investigator monitor subject monthly preconception intervention . After 16 week lifestyle modification , subject randomize receive standardize empiric infertility treatment , regardless adherence success achieve treatment goal . This treatment consist ovarian stimulation CC follow ultrasound follicular monitoring , hCG trigger ovulation , single partner intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) per treatment cycle three treatment cycle . The goal treatment group maintain level physical activity weight achieve pretreatment phase empiric infertility treatment phase . Subjects conceive follow throughout pregnancy wireless activity monitor wireless scale . Additionally three brief onsite visit pregnancy ( per trimester 16 , 24 , 32 week ) onsite determination weight , glycemic , blood pressure change collection biospecimens . All pregnancy outcomes track . Subjects deliver encourage donate placenta cord blood study repository enroll Pregnancy Registry continue infant follow-up . The investigator also expand number variety specimen collect repository partner include urine serum , semen , saliva , placenta cord blood .</detailed_description>
