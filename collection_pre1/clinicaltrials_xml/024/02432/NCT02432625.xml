	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) rare disorder cause bone break easily . People OI may break bone little trauma , dentinogenesis imperfecta ( DI ) , , adult year , hear loss . It see gender race . OI range severe mild . Individuals severe type OI may die birth . People severe OI survive may bow arm leg , short stature unable walk . People mild form OI may break bone occasionally normal height lifespan . People OI also often problem spine . The spine problem include compression fracture scoliosis ( curvature spine ) . DI characterize grey brown teeth may chip wear break easily . Before genetic cause OI know , OI classify four type . Each type base upon symptom severity OI . In people OI , cause change one gene make protein call type 1 collagen . In past decade , discover 5 % people OI another gene . Some doctor classify OI severe well gene cause OI . Our research aim : 1 . Perform DNA test collect natural history data individual enrol longitudinal study . The genetic cause brittle bone disease compare thing like severity , various feature response treatment . 2 . We see often people type I OI vertebral compression fracture spine . We x-rays see often get compression fracture vertebrae , happen time risk factor increase risk compression fracture . 3 . We follow people form OI see often develop scoliosis ( curvature spine ) . We look effect scoliosis lung function , ability walk quality life . We also look effect various treatment ( brace , surgery , etc . ) scoliosis lung function . 4 . We look dental health people OI . We see often people OI problem teeth alignment . Importantly , see dental health impact person 's quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BBD Longitudinal Study Osteogenesis Imperfecta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose natural history study perform long-term follow-up large group people osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) . We collect information include : - medical history - number broken bone , - surgery do - medication take , - ability walk , - pain - lung function breathe - hear - bone mineral density The overall goal improve health quality life people OI . There total 1000 people OI study . We ask come every year five year follow test ask : Birth History past surgical history , Current medical history , Scoliosis evaluation , Walking ability Questionnaire , Dental Quality Life Questionnaire , Scoliosis fracture Quality Life Questionnaires , Physical development evaluation , Medications use We perform physical exam , dental exam , assess well lung work , perform hear test , measure ability walk get around , assess strength able certain thing , perform Walk Test . We take follow X-rays : measure bone density ( strength ) DEXA scan , take X-ray spine , take X-ray hand , take X-ray jaw . We collect follow sample : We collect 1 teaspoon blood study gene , may collect skin cell biopsy , collect 1 teaspoon blood 2 teaspoon urine future research OI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Natural History Study : Have DNA test skin collagen test prove OI Your clinical history xrays highly suggestive OI , diagnosis verify collagen DNA test Vertebral Compression Fractures component You genetic change body make half normal amount collagen . These type genetic change call nonsense frameshift mutation COL1A1 COL1A2 gene Scoliosis OI component : You older 3 year age Dental Craniofacial Abnormalities OI component : You older 3 year age agree dental exam digital photo teeth face take . Natural History Study You ca n't return study visit least yearly You condition OI You OI second genetic syndromic diagnosis Vertebral Compression Fractures component You use medication bisphosphonates , calcitonin , calcitriol , fluoride , etc. , past year . You condition OI affect muscle and/or bone development ( example include cerebral palsy , rickets , etc . ) You nonsense frame shift mutation final coding exon COL1A1 COL1A2 . Scoliosis OI component : You unable spine xrays take . Dental Craniofacial Abnormalities OI component : You refuse dental examination .</criteria>
