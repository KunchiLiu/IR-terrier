	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ADCT-301 patient relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma . Patients participate dose-escalation phase ( Part 1 ) receive escalate dos ADCT-301 every 3 week . In Part 2 study , patient receive recommend dose ADCT-301 every 3 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ADCT-301 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , first human clinical study ADCT-301 evaluate safety tolerability pharmacokinetics ADCT-301 patient relapsed/refractory lymphoma . ADCT-301 human monoclonal antibody attach via cleavable linker pyrrolobenzodiazepine ( PBD ) warhead , internalize antigen express cell , covalently cross link deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) prevent replication . The study conduct 2 part : In part 1 ( dose escalation ) 30 patient receive infusion ADCT-301 Day 1 , every 3 week . Dose escalation continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . In Part 2 ( expansion ) 60 patient assign receive recommend dose ADCT-301 determine Dose Escalation Steering Committee . For patient , study include screen period ( 28 day ) , treatment period , follow-up period ass disease progression survival 12 month last dose study drug . The total study duration dependent overall patient tolerability study drug response treatment . It anticipate entire study ( Parts 1 2 ) could last approximately 3 year first patient treat last patient complete .</detailed_description>
