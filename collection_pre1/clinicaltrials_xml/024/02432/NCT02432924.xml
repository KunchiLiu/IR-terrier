	<brief_title>Using Combined Instantaneous Multidimensional Feedback Support Change Physical Activity Behaviour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advancements monitor technology permit accurate capture sophisticated physical activity information also enable provision bespeak multidimensional feedback . Personalised feedback , self-monitoring goal-setting technique show effective support change behaviour improve motivation awareness . To date feedback provide physical activity intervention invariably focus one aspect behaviour mixed result . Pedometers example sole focus number step one take show reasonably effective form instant feedback short-term effect rarely sustain device remove . Tailored information achievement 30 minute moderate vigorous intensity activity also partially effective . One reason might focus one aspect become prescriptive n't allow individual explore important aspect might align interest , need preference . Having narrow focused goal information would likely frustrate rather support individual 's need autonomy competence , think crucial adoption maintenance new behaviour . In research , want find whether provision instantaneous multidimensional personalise feedback different health-harnessing aspect physical activity effective supporting adult make meaningful change physical activity behaviour . The study take mixed method approach involve two phase . Phase 1 involve 2 group randomise control trial examine use combine instantaneous multidimensional feedback 6-week period follow-up outcome assessment 6-weeks intervention finish . The second phase involve short one-to-one semi structure interview intervention participant design qualitatively explore preferred feature intervention effective motivating support change behaviour and/or understand n't effective applicable . The qualitative interview take place 6-week follow-up assessment complete influence result outcome measure .</detailed_description>
