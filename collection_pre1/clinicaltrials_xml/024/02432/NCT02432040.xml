	<brief_title>Efficacy Atorvastatin Adjunctive Treatment Chronic Plaque Type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , parallel-group , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . The study conduct February 2013 October 2013 dermatology out-patient clinic tertiary hospital Philippines . Twenty-eight patient age 19-65 year old assess mild moderate chronic plaque psoriasis , psoriasis area severity index ( PASI ) score less 10 , enrol study randomize two equal treatment group . Before participate study , patient require washout period psoriasis pharmacotherapy least 2 month phototherapy systemic drug , 2 week topical therapy . Exclusion criterion follow : patient uncontrolled hypertension , endocrine metabolic disease ; patient know allergy treatment ; patient active liver disease liver enzymes ( AST ALT ) thrice upper limit ; patient myopathy presence elevate creatine kinase ( CK-MM ) level ; patient take drug might interact statin already take statin patient clear indication statin treatment ; patient impair renal function creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL ; patient active infection white blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 10 pregnant lactating female . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki approve ethic committee . Informed consent obtain participant study entry . Patients randomly assign two group computer-generated randomization table sequence assignment unknown primary investigator . The assigned intervention place sequentially-numbered , opaque envelope , open one secondary investigator patient agree participate study . Patients assign numerical code indicate case record form . Fourteen patient take atorvastatin 40 mg day 14 patient take similar-looking placebo tablet day . The study duration 6 month . All patient allow continue use betamethasone valerate 0.1 % ointment twice day duration study . Dispensing medication do secondary investigator , clinical assessment do primary investigator blind treatment assignment . Patients ' PASI score , lipid profile , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , hsCRP level , dermatology life quality index ( DLQI ) score take baseline . Recording lipid profile , AST , ALT value do another secondary investigator primary investigator would bias decrease value lipid profile elevation AST ALT . Photo-documentation do throughout study . Patients also ask bring medication visit primary investigator could check compliance . PASI score , lipid profile , AST , ALT level monitor monthly , DLQI score hsCRP level evaluate 6 month therapy . Difference mean change PASI score , lipid profile level , DLQI score , hsCRP level group compare . Difference proportion patient reach 50 % reduction PASI score ( PASI-50 ) 3 month 6 month therapy compare . Correlation change PASI score change lipid profile level , well correlation change PASI score change hsCRP level compute . The period observation adverse event start time subject receive first dose study drug last follow-up . Adverse event monitor active query spontaneous reporting . Intention-to-treat analysis primary efficacy analysis . Patients include least one assessment beyond baseline ( Month 1 ) . The last measurement randomize patient move forward represent end-of-treatment measurement 6 month . Per-protocol analysis secondary efficacy analysis . All data analysis perform use statistical software ( STATA 12.0 ) .</detailed_description>
