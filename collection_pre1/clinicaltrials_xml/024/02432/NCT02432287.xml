	<brief_summary>Metformin , FDA approve first-line drug treatment type 2 diabetes , know beneficial effect glucose metabolism . Evidence animal model vitro study suggest addition effect glucose metabolism , metformin may influence metabolic cellular process associate development age-related condition , inflammation , oxidative damage , diminish autophagy , cell senescence apoptosis . As , metformin particular interest clinical translational research age since may influence fundamental age factor underlie multiple age-related condition . The investigator therefore propose pilot study examine effect metformin treatment biology age human . Namely , whether treatment metformin restore gene expression profile old adult impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) young healthy subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Longevity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging human well-established primary risk factor many disable disease condition , among diabetes , cardiovascular disease , Alzheimer 's disease cancer . In fact , risk death cause dramatically accelerate ( 100-1000 fold ) age 35 85 year . For reason , need development new intervention improve maintain health old age - improve `` healthspan '' . Several mechanism show delay age process , result improve healthspan animal model , include mammal . These include caloric restriction , alteration GH/IGF1 pathway , well use several drug resveratrol ( SIRT1 activator ) rapamycin ( mTOR inhibitor ) . At Einstein , investigator work discover pathway associate exceptional longevity . The investigator propose study drug already common clinical use ( FDA approve ) possible alternative purpose -healthy age . The investigator goal identify additional mechanism involve age , delay age prevention age-related disease . In proposal , investigator explore possibility commonly use drug , metformin , reverse relevant aspect physiology biology age . Metformin FDA approve drug common use US since 1990s . It first-line drug choice prevention treatment type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . The effect metformin age extensively study , associate longevity many rodent model . Metformin also extend lifespan nematode , suggest evolutionarily conserve mechanism . A recent high impact study demonstrate metformin reduces oxidative stress inflammation extend lifespan health span mouse model . If indeed metformin `` anti-aging '' drug , administration associate less age-related disease general , rather decreased incidence single age-related disease . This notion lead investigator study whether anti-aging effect demonstrate type 2 diabetes population . Notably , United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) metformin , compare anti-diabetes drug , demonstrate decrease risk cardiovascular disease . This suggested study meta-analyses remains active area research . In addition , numerous epidemiologic study show association metformin use decrease risk cancer , well decreased cancer mortality . There also evidence study perform in-vitro in-vivo metformin 's role attenuate tumorigenesis . The mechanism propose relate effect reduce insulin level , improve insulin action , decrease IGF-1 signaling ( central mammalian longevity ) , well activation AMP-kinase . In fact , metformin 's potential protective effect cancer gain much attention , 100 ongoing study register Clinical Trials.gov website . To characterize pathway associate increase lifespan healthspan , investigator plan compile repository muscle adipose biopsy sample obtain young healthy subject older adult treatment potential anti-aging drug . RNA-Seq analysis use identify unique biological `` fingerprint '' age tissue compare change gene expression old adult post-drug therapy profile young healthy subject . This overall approach support grant Glenn Foundation Study Biology Human Aging . The investigator believe metformin change biology age tissue young profile , support notion drug may widespread use - `` anti-aging '' drug .</detailed_description>
