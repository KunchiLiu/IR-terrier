	<detailed_description>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) uncommon disease affect woman . It associate cystic lung destruction progressive respiratory failure . The Multicenter International LAM Efficacy Sirolimus ( MILES ) Trial , lead investigator ' research team , demonstrate mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) inhibition sirolimus effective therapy stabilize decline FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume ) . However , lung function decline resume drug stop one year point MILES , suggest therapy suppressive rather remission-inducing , may need lifelong . The investigator therefore need know whether long-term therapy sirolimus safe effective . To accomplish goal , investigator conduct Multicenter International Durability Safety Sirolimus LAM Trial ( MIDAS ) . This observational `` registry '' trial . The investigator propose enroll 300 LAM patient , previously fail intolerant consider take sirolimus everolimus clinical reason longitudinal observational study . This registry follow lung function test adverse event period least 2 year . The mTOR inhibitor therapy initiate manage participant 's clinician . The study plan use collect data standard care . This study help u refine treatment patient LAM determine long term suppressive therapy sirolimus prevent progression later stag disease . This research accomplish part Rare Lung Disease Clinical Network Consortium , data store analyzed Database Management Coordinating Center ( DMCC ) part NIH-supported Rare Disease Consortium .</detailed_description>
