	<brief_summary>The cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) currently lead cause death Brazil estimate 62 million stroke survivor worldwide . Thus , stroke sequel major public health problem Brazil world , exist treatment often insufficient complete recovery . Thus study aim identify predictor different response rehabilitation therapy evaluation clinical neurophysiological data perform treatment . For neurophysiological study use association electroencephalogram ( EEG ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . This last one perform baseline single Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) session , aim leverage ability technics analyze cerebral plasticity . As secondary objective : 1 ) Identify specific feature brain plasticity involve recovery stroke discus possible implication finding therapeutic approach ; 2 ) Search possible electrophysiological marker use surrogate outcome stroke motor sequel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) currently lead cause death Brazil estimate 62 million stroke survivor worldwide . Thus , stroke sequel major public health problem Brazil world , exist treatment often insufficient complete recovery . Thus , search new treatment necessary , well need optimize individualize exist treatment . Several approach use order find predictor recovery patient stroke , highlight recent study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tractography . However study important limitation high cost , mainly low capacity technique quantify brain plasticity know play important role recovery stroke sequela . Thus , technique measure brain plasticity theory offer best potential predict resilience post stroke injury , among stands transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . TMS noninvasive brain stimulation technique suitable measure motor cortex excitability turn use indirect measure brain plasticity . Another interesting approach combination TMS study neuronal function electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . The EEG stroke , also suggest sequelae recovery predictor , however scenario association finding TMS yet explore . Thus study aim identify predictor different response rehabilitation therapy evaluation clinical neurophysiological data perform treatment . For neurophysiological study use association electroencephalogram ( EEG ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . This last one perform baseline single Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) session , aim leverage ability technics analyze cerebral plasticity .</detailed_description>
