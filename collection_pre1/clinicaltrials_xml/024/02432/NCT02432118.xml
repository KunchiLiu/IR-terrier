	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study use radiofrequency-guided localization patient abnormal breast tissue undergo lumpectomy ( type breast-sparing surgery ) . The radiofrequency identification localization system consist implantable radiofrequency identification tag hand-held radiofrequency reader mark abnormal breast tissue surgery later surgically retrieve . Radiofrequency-guided localization may make easy find remove abnormal breast tissue lumpectomy .</brief_summary>
