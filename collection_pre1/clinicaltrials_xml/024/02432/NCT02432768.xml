	<brief_summary>Background : Patients sugar metabolism disorder , Glycogen Storage Disease Type V , insufficient breakdown sugar store , glycogen , within cell . The investigator know previous study McArdle patient , reduce sugar metabolism , also problem increase fat metabolism exercise fully compensate energy deficiency . Studies Triheptanoin diet use patient metabolic disease show Triheptanoin increase metabolism fat sugar . In patient , Triheptanoin positive effect physical performance reduces level symptom experience patient . Aim : To investigate effect treatment dietary oil , Triheptanoin , patient McArdle disease exercise capacity . Methods : 20-30 adult patient recruit Rigshospitalet Copenhagen , Denmark , Hopital Pitié-Sapêtrière Paris , France The University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas , Texas . 1 . Pre-experimental testing ( 1 day ) : Baseline blood sample collect obtain baseline value safety parameter : Plasma-acylcarnitines , free fatty acid creatine kinase . Subjects perform max-test determine VO2max 2 . Treatment period # 1 ( 2 week ) : Subjects follow diet consume dietary treatment oil . Neither patient member study group know receive type oil . 3 . Washout period ( 1 week ) : Subjects receive treatment 4 . Treatment period # 2 ( 2 week ) : Subjects receive Triheptanoin oil first treatment period , receive placebo oil vice versa . Assessments : Before treatment period , subject perform 30-minutes exercise test cycle ergometer , comprise 20-22 minute constant load exercise 6-8 minute increase load peak . Subjects complete Fatigue Severity Scale questionnaire metabolic product measure blood urine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND This project investigate treatment potential drug Triheptanoin patient inborn defect glycogen metabolism , McArdle Disease . There currently treatment available group patient . The condition lead intolerance physical exercise risk develop severe cramp contracture follow muscle damage acute kidney failure . Also one third patient develop progressive muscle weakness wasting . The McArdle patient inherit defect enzyme , myofosforylase , important link glycogenolysis within skeletal muscle . As consequence , patient lack substrates glycolysis fuel muscle work ( 1 ) . The investigator previously show patient McArdle disease unable increase fat metabolism enough compensate energy insufficiency occur patient response exercise ( 2 ) . A key limitation exercise McArdle disease reduce production pyruvate , cause depletion intermediate Citric Acid Cycle ( CAC ) . Triheptanoin triglyceride glycerol three 7-carbon fatty acid chain ( heptanoate ) . The breakdown odd-number carbon fatty acid , heptanoate , generate CAC-intermediates . Triheptanoin therefore potentially boost flux CAC increase ATP energy generation cell . In patient inborn error metabolism , treatment daily Triheptanoin supplement increase metabolism fat glucose . Triheptanoin treatment reduce symptom frequency increase exercise tolerance physical performance patient ( 3,4 ) . The aim study investigate effect Triheptanoin exercise performance tolerance frequency symptom patient McArdle disease . METHODS The study design double blind placebo control cross-over study . During 5 week trial period study patient go 2 week treatment period , 1 week wash-out period without treatment follow another 2 week treatment period . In one treatment period , patient take daily dietary oil supplement contain Triheptanoin period , oil contains regular safflower oil ( placebo ) . Both Triheptanoin placebo oil manufacture , pack hand manufacturer , Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. way neither patient , investigator know period , treatment give patient . Assessments : The patient meet laboratory assessment 5 occasion : - Screening visit : Patients perform peak exercise test cycle ergometer wear mask measure oxygen carbon dioxide exchange rate . Patients exercise increase workload exhaustion find maximal oxidative capacity maximal workload - Test day 1-4 : On one test day one treatment period , patient perform 30-minutes exercise test cycle ergometer work constant moderate intensity 20-22 minute follow 6-8 minute stepwise increase peak workload . Blood sample take , exercise measure concentration metabolic product . Patients report current feeling fatigue Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS-questionnaire ) Subjects : A total number 21-28 patient include study across three trial site . From Danish cohort McArdle Patients ; 5-8 patient include French cohort ; 8-10 patient include 8-10 American patient include .</detailed_description>
