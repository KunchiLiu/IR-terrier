	<brief_summary>Glioblastomas ( GBM ) common type primary brain tumor annual incidence approximately 500 patient Netherlands . Despite extensive treatment include resection , radiation therapy chemotherapy , median overall survival 14.6 month . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) amplification mutation regularly observe GBM think major contributor resistance radiotherapy chemotherapy . The common EGFR mutation GBM ( EGFRvIII ) present 30-50 % GBM . Previously MAASTRO lab show expression EGFRvIII provide GBM cell survival advantage expose stress factor hypoxia nutrient deprivation . These metabolic stress factor activate lysosomal degradation pathway , know autophagy . Inhibition autophagy sensitize cell hypoxia , reduce viable hypoxic fraction tumor &gt; 40 % subsequently sensitize tumor irradiation . Chloroquine ( CQ ) potent autophagy blocker widely investigate substance context . Previously , effect CQ demonstrate small randomized control trial GBM treat radiotherapy carmustine . Although statistically significantly different , rate death time approximately half large patient receive CQ patient receive placebo . The intracellular effect CQ dose-dependent . Therefore , author suggest increase daily dose CQ may necessary . Furthermore , combination CQ TMZ may induce damage neoplastic cell . In phase I part trial recommend dose CQ combination radiotherapy temozolomide test . In phase II part trial patient histologically confirm GBM randomized standard treatment consist concurrent radiotherapy temozolomide adjuvant temozolomide ( arm A ) standard treatment plus CQ ( arm B ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multi-centre randomize control , open label , phase II trial patient de-novo GBM . Eligible patient randomize arm A arm B : Arm A ( standard ) : Radiotherapy chemotherapy accord standard protocol newly diagnose GBM . This consist 30 daily fraction 2 Gy 33 fraction 1.8 Gy tumor surround margin combination temozolomide 75 mg/m² per os daily ( po qd ) six adjuvant cycle temozolomide 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd . Arm B ( experimental ) : Standard treatment describe arm A combined daily intake 400mg CQ . CQ start one week start radiotherapy end last day radiotherapy . In single centre exploratory substudy , thirty subject sequentially recruit within MAASTRO clinic randomize arm B invite receive two 3- [ 18F ] fluoro- 2- ( 4- ( ( 2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl ) methyl ) -1H-1,2,3-triazol-1- yl ) propan-1-ol PET-scans ( [ 18F ] HX4 ) . The first day -6 ( start CQ ) , second day 0 ( start radiotherapy TMZ ) .</detailed_description>
