	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect vaccine therapy pembrolizumab treat patient solid tumor spread place body usually cure controlled treatment , fail prior therapy , remove surgery . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving vaccine therapy together pembrolizumab may better treatment patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Failed Prior Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combine p53MVA vaccine ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine express p53 ) pembrolizumab well-tolerated patient refractory , tumor protein 53 ( p53 ) express cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical response anti-p53 T cell immune response . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute follow modify vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine express p53 subcutaneously ( SC ) least 30 minute later week 1 , 4 , 7 . Patients may receive additional dos pembrolizumab week 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , maximum 7 dos sign progressive disease . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
