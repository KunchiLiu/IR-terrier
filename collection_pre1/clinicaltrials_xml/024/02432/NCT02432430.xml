	<brief_summary>Dissemination research examine process factor lead widespread use evidence-based intervention . There several theory best minimize perceive actual burden practitioner associate implement evidence-based medicine . For instance , pay performance model attempt improve physician compliance quality guideline provide financial incentive .

The specific aim propose study examine effect quality improvement dissemination model immunization coverage child age 3 18 month old . The investigator propose : 1 . Determine effect immunization compliance two different model dissemination provide physicians 12 month quality improvement ( QI ) activity support implement CDC immunization best practice . Hypothesis 1a : Study participant receive QI technical support intervention ( QITS ) improvement immunization rate baseline immediately support end participant receive pay performance intervention ( P4P ) . Hypothesis 1b : Study participant receive QITS increase immunization coverage practice baseline . Hypothesis 1c : Study participant receive P4P increase immunization coverage practice baseline .</brief_summary>
