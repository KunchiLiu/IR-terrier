	<brief_title>Ketamine Infusion Therapy Management Acute Pain Adult Rib Fracture Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized , double blind trial ketamine use adult elderly blunt trauma patient associate rib fracture admit trauma service conduct . Examples blunt mechanism include assault , fall , motor vehicle collision , motorcycle crash , motor vehicle pedestrian collision , crush injury , bicycle accident . The experimental arm trial receive ketamine infusion therapy control arm receive saline placebo infusion equivalent rate . All patient manage adjunct therapy include opiate accordance institutional thoracic trauma protocol . This trial focus adult blunt trauma patient associate rib fracture . The focus adult rib fracture patient stem injury pattern high incidence prolong opiate utilization development chronic pain . Elderly rib fracture patient certainly interest trial evaluate benefit ketamine infusion population distinct entity give discrete difference complication rib fracture goal therapy . All blunt trauma patient associate rib fracture screen . All patient enrol institutional standard thoracic trauma pathway . All individual undergo Intercostal Nerve Block ( ICNB ) Emergency Department admission Intensive Care Unit . In addition schedule medication per institutional thoracic trauma protocol , patient receive adjunct opiate therapy . Patients screen clinical pharmacy staff follow diagnosis rib fracture eligibility . Patients enrol trial randomize either experimental control arm trial . The Investigational Drug Services ( IDS ) department randomize enrollee handle administration trial drug . The infusate mixed IDS department bag label `` Ketamine / Placebo . '' The IDS department unique bag identifier , allow identify bag active ketamine placebo case emergency . A total 60 patient enrol adult arm trial additional 72 patient enrol elderly arm . Patients randomize 1:1 fashion experimental control arm . Those enrolled experimental arm receive early ketamine infusion therapy fix infusion rate . For enrolled adult trial infusion rate 2.5 mcg/kg/min elderly trial receive infusion 2.0 mcg/kg/min . All ketamine infusion calculate base ideal body weight ( IBW ) , unless actual body weight less ideal . IBW calculate male 50kg + 2.3* ( number inch 5 foot ) woman 45.5kg + 2.3* ( number inch 5 foot ) . Patients randomize control arm receive placebo saline solution equivalent rate . Time zero define time `` ketamine / placebo '' infusion begin . For inclusion trial , initiation ketamine / placebo infusion must take place within 6 hour presentation Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital ( FMLH ) . Ketamine infusion therapy continue 48 hour . At 6-8 hour post-ICNB subject assess need repeat ICNB . Need repeat ICNB define thoracic specific numeric pain score great seven . Between eight ten hour post-ketamine infusion initiation , subject thoracic specific pain score seven evaluate epidural placement Regional Anesthesia Acute Pain Service . A subject allow remove himself/herself trial un-blinded he/she , pharmacy , anesthesia , and/or surgical staff deem medically necessary . Medical necessity would determine inability treat patient appropriately without knowledge trial assignment ; otherwise assumption treat staff patient receive ketamine . All adverse event record necessary subject un-blinded event serious adverse event . The trauma anesthesia team along inpatient clinical pharmacist monitor trial patient adverse event trend . Patients follow time discharge .</detailed_description>
