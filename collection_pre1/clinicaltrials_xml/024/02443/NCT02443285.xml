	<brief_summary>Current European international guideline recommend use third-generation cephalosporin first choice , amoxicillin-clavulanate acid fluoroquinolones alternative choice . These recommendation base mainly clinical trial often conduct decade ago , assumption E. coli would involve nearly half case . The microbial etiology SBP remain relatively constant ; however , antibiotic resistance rate especially third-generation cephalosporin ( include cefotaxime ceftazidime ) , ciprofloxacin , ofloxacin increase dramatically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) , define infection ascites absence contiguous source infection . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) common potentially fatal bacterial infection patient cirrhosis ascites , occur 10 30 % patient , in-hospital mortality rate range 20 30 % . It secondary impaired humoral cellular immune response result indirect intestinal bacterial translocation ascitic fluid . SBP also associate poor long-term prognosis patient , mortality rate reach 50 70 % 1 year . Early diagnosis early optimal treatment infection appropriate antibiotic prevention hepatorenal syndrome albumin require . Current European international guideline recommend use third-generation cephalosporin first choice , amoxicillin-clavulanate acid fluoroquinolones alternative choice .
