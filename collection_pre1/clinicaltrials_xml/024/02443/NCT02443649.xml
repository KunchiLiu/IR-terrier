	<detailed_description>1 . Protocol Title Improving sleep quality people insomnia 2 . Objectives The purpose study compare effectiveness two sleep improvement program people primary psychophysiological insomnia : 1 ) Optimizing Sleep Hygiene ( OSH ) program 2 ) combination OSH hypnosis sleep improvement . The goal study : 1 ) use objective subjective assessment evaluate whether addition hypnotic suggestion sleep improvement sleep hygiene program increase effectiveness OSH , 2 ) determine subject characteristic associate hypnotic responsiveness adult primary psychophysiological insomnia . To address goal randomize control trial ( RCT ) 3 laboratory visit ( baseline , intervention , 1-month follow-up ) conduct 50 adult meet criterion psychophysiological insomnia allocate one two group : 1 ) experimental group receive intervention visit combination Optimizing Sleep Hygiene ( OSH ) program hypnosis session sleep improvement 2 ) control group receive intervention visit OSH . One-month follow-up visit conduct follow least 4 week since intervention visit . Hypnosis session sleep improvement control group offer end follow-up study visit complete follow-up measure . Each study visit last 2-3 hour . During visit participant ' personality trait , hypnotic susceptibility well measure insomnia severity , sleep quality , hygiene , daily function assess . Further , visit home subject wear watch-like actigraphic device monitoring day night activity . These actigraphic recording allow collect objective actigraphic measure sleep . The actigraphic measure collect along daily sleep medication diary period 7 day immediately baseline assessment 1 week prior one-month follow-up assessment . Additionally , one-month follow-up visit , pattern brain activity monitor subject first listen neutral sleep-related record listen record hypnosis sleep improvement . The purpose measure compare brain activity pattern identify specific biomarkers hypnotic state . Four week completion study visit participant provide information sleep experience study intervention component via telephone on-line assessment depend choice.The knowledge gain study inform literature clinicians usefulness hypnosis insomnia sufferer help identify population likely benefit use hypnosis sleep . The goal proposal address follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : Compare change baseline sleep parameter one-month follow-up visit two study group ( experimental control ) exposure intervention . Hypothesis : Greater improvement actigraphic subjective sleep parameter daily function observe experimental group compare control group . Specific Aim 2a : Identify characteristic correlate change measure sleep quality describe population potentially benefit hypnosis . Hypothesis : Several sleep-specific variable ( e.g . specific baseline insomnia symptom sleep hygiene problem ) personality feature ( e.g . hypnotic susceptibility specific personality trait ) correlate post-intervention change sleep variable . Specific Aim 2b : Identify characteristic correlate hypnotic susceptibility create scale use clinic ass hypnotic responsiveness sleep-related problem . Hypothesis : Using item instrument give study identify part Specific Aim 2a short instrument could construct quickly reliably categorize people base hypnotic responsiveness sleep-related problem . Specific Aim 3 : Assess brain wave pattern concurrent hypnosis identify psychophysiological marker specific hypnotic state order describe mechanism underlie hypnosis . Hypothesis : Based difference two state : 1 ) listen hypnosis 2 ) listen neutral sleep-related recording , brain activity marker distinguish state hypnosis state listen neutral recording could identify . Background Insomnia , characterize non-restorative sleep difficulty initiate maintain sleep , significant problem affect 10 20 % US population . Poor sleep impairs cognitive immune function , mood productivity sufferer increase risk hypertension , diabetes , cancer overall mortality . Long-term pharmacological insomnia treatment recommend due side effect , therapy sleep hygiene education often employ alternative . There also grow interest use mind-body approach manage sleep problem . Mind-body approach become popular due accessibility low side effect profile , well due increase amount research evidence indicate effectiveness . For example , recent review mind-body method improve sleep reveal among promising mind-body approach alleviate sleep problem hypnosis . Hypnosis state relaxation combine highly focused attention characterize dissociation compete thought sensation towards periphery awareness . One way achieve hypnotic state induction procedure typically follow hypnotic suggestion statement intend elicit behavioral change . Efficacy hypnosis demonstrate several condition , notably decrease pain alleviate stress-related disorder . Using hypnosis sleep improvement still develop area research . Though several study find significant beneficial effect hypnosis sleep , study use hypnosis alleviate problem influence sleep ( e.g . hot flash ) rather specifically target sleep primary focus improvement . Moreover , majority study sleep hypnosis use subjective measure evaluate sleep quality . Further , remain unclear best candidate benefit hypnosis hypnotic responsiveness assess clinic without lengthy test hypnotic susceptibility . To address gaps current knowledge , goal study : 1 ) use objective subjective assessment evaluate whether addition hypnotic suggestion sleep improvement sleep hygiene education program increase program effectiveness , 2 ) determine subject characteristic associate hypnotic responsiveness adult primary psychophysiological insomnia . 3 . Design : The plan study single-blind two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) three study visit ( baseline , intervention , one-month follow-up ) , participant randomly assign receive Optimizing Sleep Hygiene ( OSH ) program intervention either alone conjunction hypnosis sleep improvement intervention visit .</detailed_description>
