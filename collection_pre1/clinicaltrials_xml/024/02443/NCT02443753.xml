	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy EndoBarrier® SANS™ overweight obese subject type 2 diabetes . The barbless second generation device develop mean reduce incidence adverse event associate barbs predicate device maintain similar efficacy profile measure change weight diabetic endpoint ( HbA1c , blood glucose , insulin , etc. ) . This first use human primarily evaluate preliminary safety , tolerability efficacy new design . Because new design first study human subject , 3 month implant duration evaluate study .</brief_summary>

The EndoBarrier® SANS™ provide alternate passage chime duodenum proximal sixty centimeter jejunum replicate part bypass bariatric surgery . This study conduct single clinical site Malaysia . Approximately 16 subject enrol two cohort 8 subject . The two cohort implant one week apart implantation second cohort trigger absence major technical clinical issue ( i.e . safety , tolerability ) observe first cohort first seven day .</detailed_description>
