	<brief_summary>Combination antiretroviral treatment ( cART ) effectively suppress virus replication partially restore immune function . However , cART cure HIV infection . This study aim investigate whether antiviral immune response enhance and/or viral transcription reactivate MGN1703 . MGN1703 agonist toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 9 . Activation TLR9 show augment innate adaptive immune effector function , notably enhance NK cell T cell function . Furthermore , TLR9 agonists show vitro reactivate viral transcription latently infected cell , potentially lead enhance recognition infect cell immune effector cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Part A , participant receive 4 week MGN1703 therapy ( 60 mg s.c. twice weekly ) . During 4 week , participant closely monitor safety therapeutic effect drug . Targeted enrolment Part A 14-16 study subject . In Part B , participant receive 24 week MGN1703 therapy ( 60 mg s.c. twice weekly ) . During 24 week , participant frequently monitor safety therapeutic effect drug . Targeted enrolment Part B 10-12 study subject , preferentially recruit part A .</detailed_description>
