	<detailed_description>Obesity common public health problem increase worldwide alarm rate . According National nutrition survey statistic 2007 , prevalence obesity kingdom Saudi Arabia 23.6 % woman 14 % men . Also prevalence overweight Saudi community determine 30.7 % men compare 28.4 % woman . First trimester screen 11-14 week gestation know effective reliable screen test Down syndrome trisomy 18.First trimester screening allow early identification pregnancy risk fetal aneuploidy anatomic defect , particularly , cardiac anomaly , therefore , provide option earlier diagnosis chorionic villus sample analysis amniocytes . The well-known association obesity pregnancy variety maternal fetal complication increase importance early aneuploidy screening . Fetal aneuploidy risk assessment base combination maternal age , prior affected pregnancy family history , maternal serum biochemical test fetal ultrasound marker . The impact obesity quality prenatal ultrasound examination well establish great risk suboptimal visualization , particular , fetal cardiac structure craniospinal structure body mass index 90th percentile . The quality prenatal screening aneuploidy via nuchal translucency thickness measurement significantly limit among obese pregnant woman , thus , increase risk fetal anomaly . Gandhiet al , note increase BMI associate suboptimal visualization nuchal translucency , associate long time perform first-trimester ultrasound examination aneuploidy risk assessment , increase need transvaginal ultrasound examination optimum nuchal translucency visualization . There evidence suggest fetal anatomic evaluation low-risk gravida well accomplish first trim use transvaginal route , provide valuable option obese patient .</detailed_description>
