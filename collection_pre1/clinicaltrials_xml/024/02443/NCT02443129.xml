	<brief_title>Swept Source Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A structurally functionally normal choroidal vasculature essential retinal function . The status choroid appear crucial determinant pathogenesis diseases age-related choroidal atrophy , myopic chorioretinal atrophy , central serous chorioretinopathy , chorioretinal inflammatory disease , tumor . The vivo structure choroid health disease incompletely visualized traditional imaging modality , include indocyanine green angiography ultrasonography . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) establish medical imaging technique use light capture micrometer-resolution , three-dimensional image within optical scatter medium . OCT base low-coherence interferometry . Nowadays , essential manage retinal condition . Unfortunately , standard spectral domain optic coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) limit use image choroidal morphology . A modification standard technique , term enhanced depth image optical coherence tomography ( EDI-OCT ) , able image choroid good clarity use commercial SD-OCTs . With advent enhance depth image optical coherence tomography ( EDI-OCT ) , detailed visualisation choroid vivo make possible possible . Measurements choroidal thickness ( CT ) also enable new direction research study normal pathological process within choroid . However , EDI-OCT limitation : outer choroidal border always visualize choroidal detail sometime lack clarity . A new generation OCTs make available , base swept-source technology . Swept source OCT ( SS-OCT ) show precise spectral domain EDI-OCT measuring choroidal thickness . Our department use two OCTs , one SD- OCT ( Canon HS-100 ) , one SS- OCT ( Topcon DRI Atlantis ) . The investigator would interested apply EDI technique SS- OCT , modify acquisition protocol . Doing , investigator hope improve visualization choroid perhaps even sclera . This modification base technique describe Spaide SD-OCT. From patient 's perspective , involve spending time fix green stimulus ( 4 minute instead 2 , order follow swept-source EDI protocol addition standard sweep source ) .</detailed_description>
