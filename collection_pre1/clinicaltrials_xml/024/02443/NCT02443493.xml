	<brief_summary>Up 90 % radiotherapy patient develop certain degree skin reaction treat area , also know radiodermatitis ( RD ) . Currently , wide variety strategy manage RD , include cream , gel , ointment , wound dressing . However , , still comprehensive , evidence-based consensus treatment RD . Low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) promising , non-invasive technique treat RD . In recent pilot study conduct research group , LLLT prevent aggravation RD provide symptomatic relief patient undergo radiotherapy breast cancer breast-sparing surgery . This pilot study first prospective study investigate potential LLLT RD . In current study , want investigate efficacy LLLT tool prevention radiodermatitis breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>
