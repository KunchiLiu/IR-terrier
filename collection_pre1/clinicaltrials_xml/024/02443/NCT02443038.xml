	<brief_title>Yoga 's Effect Fall Risk Factors Rural , Older Adult Population ; Academic/Community Partnership</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2 year pilot project develop intervention , test research method evaluation ass effect yoga core strength balance old population effort ultimately reduce frequency fall . The literature suggests increase core body strength improve balance reduces fall frequency elderly . Yoga increase core strength . There limited evidence regular yoga exercise associate decreased frequency fall old adult population . However , randomized trial test impact yoga program fall frequency . The investigator ' goal project develop yoga program feasible , safe , acceptable old population test intervention , research method evaluation preparation conduct randomized trial intervention . This study conduct investigator community partner , age disability resource center ( ADRC ) Southwest Wisconsin . The ADRC help recruiting , post ADRC 's website flyer . The ADRC provide location class assessment . Recruitment also occur local community event announcement . An advisory board 8-10 member older adult inform need feasibility , help review handbook video . The advisory board involvement preparatory phase research , along full project oversight . Enrollment Questionnaire Eligible subject ask complete brief questionnaire . The questionnaire include question : 1 ) Demographics include age , gender , race , ethnicity , year education , income level , 2 ) Number fall past 1 month , 6 month 1 year , 3 ) Fear fall question use ABC ( Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale ) . Visit 2- Physical Activity Assessment The physical activity assessment conduct one-on-one Physical Therapist occur individual ADRC office yoga class hold . Height weight measure first assessment . Testing consist 3 low physical demand test static dynamic balance gait characteristic : 1 ) The Berg Balance Scale , 2 ) The Functional Gait Assessment , 3 ) The Dynamic Gait Index . Each test require minimal moderate amount exertion , typically enough cause shortness breath transient mild increase heart rate . The total time anticipate conduct test 60 minute . The investigator choose test validate measure investigator ' subject population , require special equipment , take minute administer , safe perform old adult population . Visits 3 18- Intervention The intervention consist 16 bi-weekly 50-60 minute yoga class , conduct certify yoga therapist , case advisory group , class question improvement class take 5 minute . Additionally , 10 minute home exercise pose 5 minute relaxation do day class . The control group practice 5 minute relaxation day class . There 3 class ( 3 different county ) , first 8-10 member advisory board . The second third class 10-15 participant workshop . The target 60 total participant ( include advisory board ) . There 2-3 month first set class second third set class refine method conduct enrollment test subsequent group . A co-investigator give envelope contain patient assignment home practice home practice 3rd visit . The envelope number participant randomly choose among envelope . The co-investigator note participant name envelope number know content envelope assignment . Another investigator note assignment home exercise control envelope number file save password protect computer investigator office back UW- Madison secure server . A printout place seal envelope kept lock ADRC office open upon completion data collection . The general philosophy yoga class create environment safety pose avoid culture competition subject push beyond individual ability . Classes consist : 1 ) Centering ; 2 ) Warm ; 3 ) A variety simple pose modification increase safety reduce potential fall ( picture examples include manual described/illustrated , include 3 home practice pose ; 4 ) cool ; 5 ) 5 minute relaxation period . Poses focus alignment principle , low extremity core strengthening , common flexibility deficit think related impaired balance . Modifications individual range motion provide necessary . Poses supplement advanced accommodate individual need . Subjects ( intervention group ) also ask perform set pose home take approximately 10 minute day . The pose illustrate photo home log . The home exercise perform daily week day class day . Subjects record home activity . Home Log Book Data Collection , Intervention Subjects ( intervention group ) give home log book first yoga class . The log book include general instruction , researcher contact information specific instruction 3 home pose include picture illustration . Subjects instruct record date length time time subject home pose discomfort problem occur home exercise . Poses supplement advanced accommodate individual need . Subjects instruct bring log book class instructor check see log book complete correctly assess adverse event ( AEs ) unanticipated problem ( UPs ) . Subjects also track fall 8 week intervention 4 month follow completion intervention . Home Log study control group Half class randomize either home exercise group control group yoga exercise outside classroom environment . The control group encourage yoga pose learn class home class complete . Instructors record subject attendance class , subject bring log book AEs UPS . Instructors also record total class time start finish pose do class spreadsheet . The investigator anticipate total twice weekly yoga class take 16 hour home activity take ( 5 x 15 minute x 16 week ) 20 total hour group assign home exercise ( 5 x 5 minute x 16 week ) 6.5 hour control group . Total time involvement include 16 hour class time , enrollment visit pre post assessment visit 40 hour intervention group 26 hour control group . Visit 19- Repeat Physical Assessment Questionnaire Final assessment occur within 2 week final yoga class . Instructors investigator strongly encourage participant , include drop out , complete final assessment . Final assessment include : 1 ) A questionnaire pre-intervention fall related survey question ( include ABC ( Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale ) , additional question yoga class , home exercise use logbook ; 2 ) Post-intervention physical activity assessment . The post-intervention physical assessment initial assessment except height weight re-measured . This final visit expect last 1 hour . A co-investigator call participant 2 month 4 month complete class , ask question fall yoga practice home . Each phone call take 5 minute . Sample Size Analysis : Since pilot program develop intervention assessment method , investigator sample size 60 subject base practicality limit available time funding . Based previous yoga teach experience , 14 people manageable class size allow personal attention adjust pose necessary subject safety group . The investigator anticipate 20 % drop rate final sample size 48 subject . With small sample size , moderate level pre-intervention physical function subject , investigator may find significant change physical activity measure . The investigator hope find trend toward increase ability maintain balance . Descriptive statistic use create sum score fall question . Paired test repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use analyze pre- intervention post- intervention physical activity measure .</detailed_description>
