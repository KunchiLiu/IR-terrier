	<brief_title>Comparison Loop Drainage Versus Incision Drainage Abscesses Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND INFORMATION : Infections skin soft tissue remain one common chief complaint pediatric emergency department . With methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevalent pathogen , abscess development uncommon . The emergency department remain common setting require therapeutic intervention . However , active investigation exist regard ideal intervention child adult . Incision drainage cutaneous abscess remain standard care year . However standard adopt without robust supportive evidence . Recently , various study question benefit various aspect treatment , include antibiotic , incision size , necessity packing . Other study even suggest less-invasive approach . Some utilized vessel loop demonstrate reduced need home-health visit , reduce inpatient length stay , good patient tolerance , increase failure rate . These study , however , retrospective design execution primarily surgical team . STUDY DESCRIPTION : Upon obtain write informed consent/assent study team member , subject randomize use computerized randomization procedure opaque envelope . Initially , thorough history physical exam perform . A data sheet complete detail patient characteristic ( eg . age , gender , ethnicity , prior treatment ) wound characteristic ( eg . great diameter erythema induration , presence spontaneous drainage , location ) . Pain control/procedural sedation select discretion treat physician , consistent current local practice ( eg . topical lidocaine , intranasal fentanyl and/or midazolam , oral acetaminophen/hydrocodone ibuprofen , intravenous ketamine , morphine , fentanyl ) . Pain assess prior physical exam shortly procedure via validated FACES-Revised Pain Scale . The patient provide assessment 5 year old . Otherwise , parent provide degree pain perceive child . The difference two pain assessment evaluate endpoint . Physicians report satisfaction procedure use 5-point Likert scale . The control arm incision drainage require single linear incision fluctuant portion abscess length deem necessary treating physician . Expressed content send wound culture . Loculations disrupt hemostat follow copious irrigation sterile saline . At discretion treat physician , wound may pack Â¼-inch iodoform gauze dress dry gauze . The intervention arm vessel loop-drainage require placement small incision 4-5 mm periphery induration . Expressed content send wound culture . Using hemostat , loculations disrupt express . Using hemostat abscess cavity , opposite aspect probe second 4-5 mm incision place . The cavity copiously irrigated saline . A vessel loop ( DeRoyal Industries ; Powell , TN ) pull cavity via two incision loosely tie skin use surgeon knot . The wound dress dry gauze . A prescription antibiotic pain medication provide discretion treat physician . The parent give standardize wound-care instruction ( twice-daily soak 5 day dry dress re-application ) , contact information ( phone email ) confirm , selection 24-48 hour follow-up make , necessity 14- 90-day follow-up emphasize . The parent encourage keep pain medication diary ( chart upon care instruction ) bring diary 2 initial follow-up appointment . Upon completion initial ED encounter , data collect regard type pain control/procedural sedation ED course , selection prescribe antibiotic pain medication , eventually result wound culture . 24-48 hour incision drainage procedure , subject return ED repeat evaluation . Packing remove patient standard incision drainage arm . The wound evaluate five inflammatory component ( i.e . presence induration , fluctuance , drainage , tenderness , warmth ) . If evaluate physician decides abscess still present require re-instrumentation , infection require admission IV antibiotic , treatment failure declare . Following assessment , control arm may repacked determined necessary . Parents report satisfaction procedure , simplicity anxiety wound care utilize Likert scale 1-5 . Pain medication use quantify use diary document . Their contact information reconfirm second follow-up appointment schedule . Subjects loop-drainage arm receive emphasize instruction technique time loop removal . This perform home drainage cease . Local practice general surgeon group suggest typically around post-operative day 5 . Previous loop study perform removal near day 8 10 . We encourage parent remove loop day 7 ( drainage cease ) simply cut one side loop pull cavity . A phone call perform day 7 ass readiness provide support removal . The day loop removal document . Follow-up post-procedure day 14 perform ED physician member study team . Prior visit , parent remind via telephone email 2-3 day prior appointment . The wound evaluate sign inflammation previous visit . The wound evaluate indication re-instrumentation hospital admission ( treatment failure ) . If patient demonstrate systemic illness , parenteral antibiotic initiate admission hospital . A second assessment perform follow-up visit ; Hollander scale apply determine cosmetic outcome . The Likert scale give parent regard simplicity , anxiety wound care . Pain medication use quantify use diary document . The parent ask physician encounter ( elsewhere ) pursue re-instrumentation hospital admission occur . Follow-up encourage $ 25 gift card ( utilizing funding receive Scientific , Education Research Foundation UTSW Austin Research/Fellow Grant , research fund PEM fellowship department ) compensate family time travel . If subject unable make second follow-up appointment , phone call perform inquire patient present hospital intervention secondary treatment failure initial abscess . If phone follow-up unsuccessful , computerized chart review Seton network perform obtain end-point . At 3 month , parent call inquire satisfaction wound scar use 5-point Likert scale . They also remind return hospital obtain photographic documentation scar . Another $ 25 gift card issue able . All patient record maintain lock , secure location , accessible research personnel .</detailed_description>
