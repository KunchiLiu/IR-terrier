	<brief_summary>A prospective , single-center , double-blinded , randomize , control clinical study evaluate antalgic effect regional distant combination acupoints stimulated electroacupuncture patient undergoing Off-Pump Coronary-Artery Bypass Grafting ( OP-CABG ) .This clinical trial investigate whether electroacupuncture ( EA ) anesthesia reduce analgesic OP-CABG surgery distant group.The origin therapeutic acupuncture trace back least 2,500 year China . There explosion interest Western medicine within United States Europe application acupuncture technique . Acupuncture enjoy worldwide acceptance treat disease migraine , chronic low back pain , knee osteoarthritis . In 2002 , WHO recommend 107 symptom , syndrome , disease definitively show effectively treated acupuncture . Coronary heart disease ( angina pectoris ) among pathology . A recent clinical trial demonstrate acupuncture-assisted anesthesia strategy reduces postoperative morbidity medical cost open-heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . Previous research animal model demonstrate electroacupuncture pretreatment protects heart ischemic injury . The investigator observe electroacupuncture pretreatment ( EAP , 30-minute electric stimulation 4 electrode attached bilateral forearm acupoints ) surgery significantly attenuate serum troponin level shortly post-surgery adult heart valve replacement patient child undergo cardiac surgery correct congenital heart malformation.However , whether electroacupuncture anesthesia may reduce analgesic OP-CABG surgery , especially different combination acupoints , never previously investigate .</brief_summary>
