	<brief_summary>Hypertensive disorder common medical complication pregnancy major cause maternal , fetal , neonatal morbidity mortality . Fifty percent hypertensive disorder pregnancy define pre eclampsia , important manifestation disease . Preeclampsia also significant risk factor development IUGR represent common cause IUGR nonanomalous infant . The incidence thrombocytopenia , neutropenia Bronchopulmonary dysplasia also increase neonate preeclampsia . The neurodevelopmental outcome infant expose preeclampsia highly variable . The study Gray et al show preeclampsia associate decrease risk cerebral palsy . They also find protective effect maternal preeclampsia cerebral palsy regardless exposure magnesium sulfate . However , contrary , study conduct Shao-Wen Cheng et al show infant bear pre-eclamptic mother low MDI score 24 month age ( P= 0.04 ) compare infant without maternal pre-eclampsia . The study Szymonowicz et al show neonate bear pre-eclamptic mother significantly low mean mental developmental index , significantly child one impairment compare control group 2 year age . The neurodevelopmental outcome neonates born preeclamptic mother therefore remain inconclusive . Recently role neurobehaviour evaluate early 37-40 week CGA predict useful adjunct 12-18 month full neurodevelopmental assessment . This assume significance context initiation early stimulation objectivised individual developmental rehabilitation regimens infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia multiorgan , heterogeneous disorder pregnancy associate significant maternal neonatal morbidity mortality . The incidence preeclampsia 5 % 10 % pregnancy , high rate report first pregnancy , twin pregnancy , woman previous pre eclampsia . Fifty percent hypertensive disorder pregnancy define preeclampsia , important manifestation disease . While preeclampsia complicate 6 % -10 % pregnancy United States , incidence believe even high underdeveloped country . Perinatal mortality rate range 59 1,000 developed country 300 1,000 low income country . Preeclampsia eclampsia account 24 % maternal death india . Diagnostic criterion preeclampsia Blood pressure Greater equal 140 mm hg systolic great equal 90 mm hg diastolic two occasion least 4 hour apart 20 week gestation woman previously normal blood pressure Greater equal 160 mm hg systolic great equal 110 mm hg diastolic , hypertension confirm within short interval ( minute ) facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy And Proteinuria Greater equal 300 mg per 24 hour urine collection ( amount extrapolate timed collection ) Protein / creatinine ratio great equal 0.3 mg/dl Dipstick reading 1+ ( use quantitative method available ) Or absence proteinuria , new onset hypertension new onset following : Thrombocytopenia Platelet count le 100000/ microliter Renal insufficiency Serum creatinine concentration great 1.1 mg/dl double serum creatinine concentration absence renal disease Impaired liver function Elevated blood concentration liver transaminase twice normal concentration Pulmonary edema Cerebral visual symptom LATE PRETERMS : A SPECIAL COHORT Definition : Premature infant ( bear &lt; 37 complete week gestation ) categorize subgroups - Very preterm ( &lt; 32 complete week ) - Moderately preterm ( 32 33 complete week ) - Late preterm ( 34 36 complete week ) Late preterm birth accept term use infant bear 34 0/7 36 +6/7 week gestation . This group initially refer near term , mislead implication maturity prompt name change late preterm . Magnitude late preterm birth Prematurity lead cause morbidity mortality globally . Advances medicine technology shift distribution birth away term/post-term towards earlier gestation . The percentage live birth United States bear late preterm increase 1990 2006 7.3 % 9.14 % , 25 % increase . This increase account 84 % increase prematurity 16 year period . Thus group late preterms account maximum burden premature birth . Etiology late preterm birth Preterm delivery divide two group - The first group : Spontaneous late preterm birth ( premature labor intact membrane premature rupture membrane ) limit control prevent birth focus lie well understanding management neonate perinatal period . - The second group include premature baby bear induction labor performance cesarean section maternal fetal indication . Consequences late preterm birth Acute Medical Morbidities Mortality This group characterize physiological immaturity limit compensatory response extrauterine environment compare term infant . They great risk term baby morbidities mortality : - Temperature instability - Hypoglycemia - Respiratory distress - Apnea - Jaundice - Feeding difficulty - Dehydration - Suspected sepsis - Neurologic disorder and/or death The risk death and/or severe neurologic disorder define ischemic encephalopathy , Grade 3 4 IVH , cystic periventricular leukomalacia and/or seizure increase 1.7 % 34 Weeks gestation compare 0.15 % 38 week gestation . Long-term morbidity late preterms Long-term outcomes affected late preterm involve school performance , behaviour problem , social medical disability , mortality . Although absolute risk poor long-term outcome infant bear late preterm small , risk significantly great bear 39-40 week gestation.Medical social morbidity increase decrease gestational age . In cohort 903,402 Norwegian infant bear alive without congenital anomaly follow early adulthood , infant bear late preterm significant high risk cerebral palsy ; cognitive dysfunction ; schizophrenia ; disorder psychological development , behavior , major disability . EFFECTS OF PREECLAMPSIA ON LATE-PRETERM INFANT OUTCOMES Risk Fetal Demise/Stillbirth Severe preeclampsia represent significant risk factor intrauterine fetal demise , estimate stillbirth rate 21 per 1000 20 . In set severe preeclampsia , risk fetal death outweigh potential benefit pregnancy prolongation . However , case mild preeclampsia , risk fetal demise 50 % less pregnancy severe preeclampsia ( stillbirth rate 9 per 1000 ) Intrauterine Growth Restriction ( IUGR ) Preeclampsia , condition characterize decreased uteroplacental blood flow ischemia , significant risk factor development IUGR represent common cause IUGR nonanomalous infant . Hematologic Effects Maternal preeclampsia result neonatal thrombocytopenia , typically defined platelet count less 150,000/uL . Severity thrombocytopenia relate preeclampsia highly variable , small percentage infant develop severe clinically significant thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 50,000/uL ) . In addition well-described effect preeclampsia platelet , neonate deliver woman preeclampsia 50 % incidence neutropenia ( define absolute neutrophil count le 500 ) . Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ( BPD ) The study Hansen et al show maternal preeclampsia , associate increase risk development BPD , even adjust gestational age , birth weight , clinical confounders ( OR 2.96 , 95 % CI 1.17-7.51 )</detailed_description>
