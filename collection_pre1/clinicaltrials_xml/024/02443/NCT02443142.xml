	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) important public health problem estimate 1.7 million new case United States year . Although vast majority victim sustain mild TBI , many still develop headache , difficulty concentrating , decrease memory potential serious long-term consequence . In particular , mild TBI important consequence combat-related injury sustain military personnel sports-related injury young adult . Unfortunately , treatment mild TBI usually limit oral analgesic headache pain acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) ibuprofen ( Motrin Advil ) . Since previous randomize trial medication mild TBI , comparative effectiveness know . Increasing animal base evidence suggest mild TBI related brain cell injury cause overexpression cellular enzyme ( COX-2 ) cause neuroinflammation . Fortunately , inhibition COX-2 easily achieve use ibuprofen . We hypothesize head injured patient treat ibuprofen low incidence mild TBI symptom patient treat acetaminophen . We conduct randomized clinical trial measure comparative effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen incidence specific symptom mild TBI emergency department patient head injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The long-term goal propose project develop effective pharmacological therapy patient mild TBI improve functional outcome . The main objective compare effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen reduce short-term development post-concussion symptom patient mild TBI . We conduct double-blinded randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) specific aim measure comparative effect equipotent dos ibuprofen versus acetaminophen incidence concussion symptom measure 7 10 day mild TBI emergency department patient isolate closed head injury . The main study hypothesis research project patient mild TBI treat ibuprofen low incidence post-concussion symptom compare patient treat acetaminophen . The propose investigation novel first RCT compare analgesic medication specific treatment mild TBI . BACKGROUND Pathophysiology Mild TBI . TBI result external mechanical force apply cranium lead parenchymal brain damage . This resultant brain injury range mild temporary impairment severe disability . TBI transpire two phase : ( 1 ) primary brain injury occur moment application mechanical force cranium result laceration , contusion , hematoma shear injury brain ; ( 2 ) secondary brain injury begin immediately primary brain injury result cellular mediation neuroinflammation.15,16 The principal injury mild TBI diffuse axonal injury shear force usually identify CT brain scan.17-20 Secondary brain injury activate multiple cellular pathway initially adaptive , become pathological overexpression persistence.21-23 The biochemical consequence response develop period hour accumulation arachidonic acid cellular membrane store induction cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) gene expression enzyme activity.15,16 Arachidonic acid convert detrimental vasoactive prostanglandins free radical COX-2 enzyme lead neuronal cell death ( Figure 1 see appendix ) . Neural COX-2 enzyme activity remain elevated 1 3 days.24 Severity neuronal injury correlate COX-2 overexpression result `` vicious cycle '' neuroinflammation secondary injury propagate COX-2 activity.15,16 Potential Effect COX-2 Inhibition . If COX-2 overexpression cause neuronal cell damage brain injury , COX-2 inhibition may provide neuroprotective effect two important mechanism : ( 1 ) reduce detrimental vasoactive prostanglandins free radical synthesis ; ( 2 ) shunt arachidonic acid alternate pathway produce beneficial eicosanoids.15 These cellular mechanism base finding several animal study past 30 year strongly suggest potential beneficial effect NSAID inhibition COX-2 enzyme treatment TBI-activated neuroinflammation.25-35 Although study examine different NSAID COX-2 kinhibitors utilize different animal model TBI , find overall consensus beneficial effect ( i.e. , reduce prostaglandin synthesis , reduce brain edema , improvement cognitive motor function , improvement memory , reduce mortality ) suggest COX-2 inhibition may effect beyond analgesia patient mild TBI . In fact , COX-2 inhibition show beneficial animal model type brain insult include ischemic brain injury.36-40 If identify beneficial effect ibuprofen patient mild TBI confirm validation study , new standard guideline develop improve ED management common form brain injury . Future study conduct elaborate effect ibuprofen NSAIDS short-term long-term complication mild TBI possible form TBI . Discovery beneficial effect NSAIDs mild TBI could especially useful combat-related sports-related brain injury . STUDY DESIGN Study subject identify enrolled emergency department . They follow 7 14 day period . The propose project complete one-year period task milestone follow : Month 1 - develop protocol , create data collection instrument codebook , test modify instrument , create electronic database , train assistant ; Months 2 10 - identify enroll eligible study subject ED setting , create database , enter edit data ; Months 11 12 - analyze data interpret finding , prepare submit paper journal . Study Design Participants . We conduct double-blinded RCT compare effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen incidence post-concussion symptom measure 7 14 day mild TBI . Treatment Variable . The treatment variable equipotent oral dos either ibuprofen ( 800 mg TID ) acetaminophen ( 1000 mg TID ) . Ibuprofen nonselective NSAID inhibit COX-1 COX-2 isoenzymes . COX-2 inhibition prevents arachidonic acid convert vasoactive prostaglandin reactive oxygen specie brain cell . The analgesic , antipyretic , antiinflammatory activity ibuprofen operate mainly inhibition COX-2.55,56 Acetaminophen poor inhibitor COX isoenzymes CNS significantly weak antiinflammatory effect NSAIDs . Acetaminophen inhibit COX peripheral tissue less effective presence peroxides.57,58 Both ibuprofen acetaminophen frequently prescribe headache pain related mild TBI ED primary care setting excellent safety profile short-term use . In fact , ibuprofen acetaminophen use antipyretic treatment child severe traumatic brain injury.59 Subjects receive first medication dose ED give remain 5 dos take 48 hour outpatient . This time period select base animal model identify maximum COX-2 activity . Both medication identically prepared prevent subject identify type treatment regimen . Treatment assignment randomize NMH research pharmacy blind patient investigator . Standard method blind implement use tablet identical size , shape , color taste ibuprofen acetaminophen . Data Collection Variable Measurement . Information concern outcome secondary study variable obtain research assistant use standardize data collection instrument . Follow outcome assessment conduct telephone interview 7 14 day head injury . We implement best practice method accurate complete data collection , include follow : ( 1 ) training assistant data collection method ; ( 2 ) blinding assistant subject ' treatment assignment ; ( 3 ) conduct meeting assistant review data collection process difficulty . Subjects persistent mild TBI symptom time follow refer Rehabilitation Institute Chicago Concussion Clinic treatment . Research Location . Northwestern Memorial Hospital state-of-the art , two million square foot , 873-bed tertiary teaching hospital downtown Chicago primary teach hospital affiliate Northwestern University Feinberg School Medicine . The Northwestern Memorial Hospital Emergency Department urban , academic , 56 bed , Level I trauma center annual patient volume 85,000 patient per year approximately 230 patient per day . The Emergency Department staff exclusively board-certified emergency medicine physician also supervise care 48 resident four fellow . The reported demographic distribution overall Emergency Department patient population follow : 7 % Hispanic ; 2 % Asian ; 35 % Black ; 63 % White . SATATISTICAL ANALYSES Data Analyses Plan . We conduct statistical analysis base American Statistical Association Ethical Guidelines Statistical Practice67,68 include follow : 1 . Univariate Analyses . We first conduct univariate analyse assess potential demographic clinical difference two treatment group . We also use ANOVA compare effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen treatment incidence mild TBI symptom use continuous measure pain score Neural-QOL measure pain cognitive function . 2 . Multivariate Analyses . We use log binomial regression model adjust potential residual confounding estimate effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen incidence mild TBI symptom . We also conduct survival analysis use Kaplan-Meier graph Cox proportional hazard regression model estimate adjust hazard ratio effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen main outcome mild TBI symptom . We also conduct likelihood ratio goodness-of-fit test identify include specific covariates regression model diagnostic method evaluate overall model fit plausibility model assumption . 3 . Advanced Methods Causal Inference . We use advanced statistical method allow assessment causation : ( 1 ) instrumental variable estimate effect ibuprofen versus acetaminophen potential treatment regimen noncompliance use treatment randomization perfect instrument ; 69,70 ( 2 ) marginal structural model account time-varying confounders ass direct versus indirect effect presence intermediate factors.71-74 Sample Size Estimation . Sample size estimation especially challenge prior human study measure effect COX-2 inhibition incidence mild TBI symptom . Notwithstanding limitation , use presence headache pain 7 14 day binary outcome . Sample size estimation base following : ( 1 ) 40 % expect frequency headache pain ibuprofen group versus 60 % expect frequency acetaminophen group ; ( 2 ) use two-sided test perform significance level 0.05 ; ( 3 ) power 0.80 detect true difference headache pain subject receive ibuprofen versus acetaminophen ; ( 4 ) one one distribution study subject receive ibuprofen versus acetaminophen . With assumption , estimate number study subject need statistically assess ibuprofen versus acetaminophen treatment mild TBI total 214 subjects.60 Our plan enroll 400 subject provide adequate sample size conduct statistical analysis . The Northwestern Memorial Hospital Emergency Department provide care 2,000 head injured patient mild TBI year .</detailed_description>
