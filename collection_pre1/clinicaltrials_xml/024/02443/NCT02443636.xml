	<brief_summary>While effective intervention depression exist , success rate unsatisfactory provision haphazard . The Canadian Depression Research Intervention Network ( CDRIN ) Maritimes Depression Hub improve delivery care quality outcomes youth , adult senior depression across Maritimes . The investigator establish integrated system assessment , treatment , research education relate depression active involvement live experience . The establishment patient registry key step facilitate evaluation reform current service , integration patient choice community resource treatment program , monitor long-term outcome , development effective treatment approach research . The registry facilitate research include validation new diagnostic outcome measurement tool , low-cost clinical trial collaborative project national international partner . Educational program involve train next generation researcher , live experience , clinician , health system manager critical appraisal facilitate involvement research . The registry , propose systematic measurement outcome broad dissemination information skill improve quality research care well experience patient family . The need registry : It increasingly recognize major advance treatment mental disorder require large scale clinical research . Recently demonstrate way complete large-scale research finite resource include routine use electronic health record ( EHR ) , data linkage randomize registry trial . Use EHR efficient way rapidly obtain large amount information . However , EHR completely exclude confound indication unmeasured variable . Therefore , test treatment effect require experimental design replace routine health record data . The gold standard test effect treatment unbiased way randomize control trial ( RCT ) , measure unmeasured confounders balance randomization process remain confound due chance alone . RCTs value high level evidence , costly take significant time complete , partly need screen large group individual identify eligible participant . The efficient unbiased test intervention , new treatment modality novel way treatment delivery method combine EHR use randomize control trial ( RCT ) methodology : randomize registry trial ( RRT ) . The RRT take advantage registry individual available information identify large number individual suitable RCT . The RRT approach efficient especially information ( e.g . diagnosis treatment history ) use repeatedly different purpose . The information use clinical purpose , service improvement multiple research project . RRT allow obtain answer efficacy new treatment management strategy significantly faster much low cost traditional RCTs . Therefore , investigator propose establish registry capacity conduct RRTs . The propose registry integrate similar effort across Canada . Jointly , collaborative network registry facilitate fast economical test new treatment , urgently need advance therapeutic option people depression related condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Registry The CDRIN Maritimes registry provide integrated platform clinical research service evaluation . Participation registry offer individual seek help mental disorder across primary , secondary tertiary care setting Nova Scotia . In spirit participatory research , participant registry become member registry keep informed registry development , well educational training opportunity . Those consent contact regard future research opportunity invite actively participate research . Number participants The number participant registry set advance depend funding need service development research study use registry . The registry scalable investigator expect enrol 1000 30,000 participant . For additional reliability study , number participant determine base power calculation . A power calculation suggest 313 400 individual assess twice required establish reliability diagnostic instrument acceptably small measurement error ( confidence interval reliability coefficient alpha 0.15 small disorder present 10 % participant ) . Therefore , investigator propose recruit 400 individual reliability study . Inclusion exclusion criteria The registry broadly inclusive minimal exclusion criterion . Any individual seek receive help mental health relate problem Nova Scotia eligible become member registry . Residents Nova Scotia eligible enter Registry understand English French capacity provide inform consent appropriate substitute decision maker provide consent behalf . There exclusion criterion relate age , sex , ethnicity . Whilst recruitment target include individual suffer depression type mental illness , specific diagnosis require participation registry . Recruitment diagnosis-independent goal registry create inclusive database individual seek mental health care Maritimes . As , specific formal diagnosis necessary . Many individual present various primary , secondary , tertiary health care setting meet full diagnostic criterion mental health condition , could still sub threshold meet diagnostic criterion later time . It important include individual registry facilitate clinical care seek mental health care also facilitate research various subset individual seek mental health care , without formal mental health diagnosis . Furthermore , restrict participation people fulfill diagnostic criterion would allow test reliability diagnosis boundaries disorder normality . Recruitment target toward individual suffer potential diagnosis Depression one common burdensome mental health condition Canada . Participants exclude registry find meet diagnostic criterion follow diagnostic interview . Participant enrollment Potential participant approach point registration , wait room clinical consultation primary , secondary tertiary care service likely serve people suffer depression type mental illness . A clinician researcher offer participation registry . After explanation registry purpose need reliability study , participant provide write informed consent information keep registry use research causation , classification treatment depression mental disorder . The participant also give option participate instrument reliability study may include repeated completion instrument . Assessments The registry include minimal set core assessment ( Tables 1 2 ) broad palette optional instrument ( Tables 3 4 ) screening , diagnosis current state ( symptom profile , severity function ) assessment youth ( Table 1 3 ) adult ( Tables 2 4 ) participant . The selection assessment instrument beyond minimal set determine conjunction participant , clinician investigator preference . It expect participant would complete optional measure give time . Selection instrument take account burden participant , single assessment take 3 hour . Tables 1 2 list minimal set instrument youth adult participant . Table 3 show broad palette optional instrument youth table 4 show full palette assessment instrument adult . Screening status assessment instrument administer repeatedly ( typically every 3-6 month , often need assess effect recently initiate treatment change care delivery ) . Diagnostic instrument typically administer ( twice participant reliability study ) , may repeat 1 5 year assess change psychopathology profile diagnosis . Screening instrument Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) core screen instrument youth participant age 16 . SDQ 25-item measure psychopathology child adolescents parent-report self-report version validate age 3-16 11-16 respectively . Simple accessible language make SDQ easy complete . Balance positive negative item make measure highly acceptable . The total difficulty scale / emotional subscale highly sensitive screener depression anxiety disorder youth . The questionnaire take 5 minute complete detects depression disorder accuracy equal high long instrument . An establish cut-off value 14 total difficulty scale SDQ use select participant likely suffer depression relate disorder . Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) core screen instrument adult old adolescent ( age 17 ) . PHQ-9 9-item self-report questionnaire extensively validate use adult , recently , adolescent . PHQ-9 highly sensitive screen depression , score 10 high suggestive diagnosis . Thanks brevity straightforward response format , PHQ-9 easy quick complete , find acceptable widely use primary secondary care practice . Mood Feelings Questionnaire ( MFQ ) alternative screen measure old child adolescent directly focus depression . MFQ two version : long 33-item version short 13-item version . The investigator use short MFQ , validate 7- 18-year old participant find acceptable cut-off 11 highly sensitive detect diagnosis major depressive disorder . Screen Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders ( SCARED ) Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale ( GAD-7 ) use optional screening measure service investigator interested detect anxiety disorder addition depression . SCARED self-report parent-report version validate child adolescent age 8-18 , high-sensitivity threshold 20 detect anxiety disorder . The self-report parent-report version find psychometrically equivalent . GAD-7 validate highly sensitive screen generalize anxiety disorder adult . GAD-7 moderately specific generalize anxiety detects range anxiety disorder . Everyday Feelings Questionnaire ( EFQ ) optionally use screen depression anxiety disorder among parent child adolescent participant . EFQ brief 10-item measure current depressive anxiety symptom balance positive negative item make highly acceptable , non- stigmatize suitable brief assessment emotional wellbeing parent child adolescent present health service . Availability spouse-report version facilitate obtain information parent one parent available direct assessment . EFQ excellent psychometric property strong convergent validity establish measure depression anxiety . Diagnostic instrument Kiddie Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia - Present Lifetime version , adapt Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) -5th Edition ( K-SADS -5 ) . K-SADS -5 semi-structured diagnostic interview establish current lifetime diagnosis mental disorder child adolescent base interview parent young person . Previous version K-SADS validate child adolescent age 7-18 found high inter-rater reliability . K-SADS recently adapt DSM-5 Dr Joan Kaufman colleague Yale University ( K-SADS-5 ) await test reliability . Based K-SADS-5 , investigator derive best estimate DSM-5 diagnosis establish consensus meeting involve experienced psychiatrist blind diagnose parent . Information provide parent submit use meeting check free indication parental diagnosis . Our team receive train use K-SADS team John Nurnberger receive additional training DSM-5 adaptation Dr Joan Kaufmann September 2014 . Structured Clinical Interview DSM-5 ( SCID-5 ) semi-structured diagnostic interview adult design administer clinically trained interviewer . While early version SCID show highly acceptable reliable , recently develop SCID-5 await test reliability . SCID-5 provide exact word question ask specific diagnostic symptom allow additional probe establish symptom presence time adequate accuracy make judgment clinical significance . SCID-5 provide algorithmic rule guide interviewer DSM-5 diagnosis allow skip question make difference diagnostic conclusion , give information already provide . In October 2013 Dr. Michael First ( Columbia University ) train team investigator Dalhousie use SCID-5 . Based preliminary experience , SCID-5 interview last 45 minute 3 hour , depend complexity psychopathology , efficiency interviewer communication skill interviewee . The interviewer clinically trained nurse , social worker , occupational therapist , psychologist psychiatrist . They initially receive three-day training Dr. First , author SCID-5 collaborator project . Following , investigator conduct monthly meeting review record interview , discuss intervene issue maintain quality interview administration . The investigator expect interview ( 70 % ) carry research coordinator ( nurses/social workers/occupational therapist ) small proportion ( 30 % ) carry investigator clinician ( psychiatrist clinical psychologist ) . The investigator record qualification experience level interviewer . Status assessment : symptom severity function Current severity depressive , anxiety psychotic symptom assess establish validated self-report clinician-rated instrument . In child adolescent , primary measure depression symptom severity broadly use extensively validated 16-item clinician-rated Children 's Depression Rating Scale-Revised ( CDRS-R ) . In addition , self- parent-rated version widely use validate 41-item Screen Child Anxiety Disorders ( SCARED ) use measure anxiety symptom child adolescent . In adult , current severity depression symptom measure primarily 10-item clinician-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , internally consistent scale highly sensitive therapeutic change , self-report Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated ( QIDS-SR ) , widely use extensively validated measure depressive symptom closely match DSM diagnostic criterion depression . Optional alternative measure depressive symptom severity adult include clinician-rated Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAM-D ) Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician Rated ( QIDS-C ) self-report Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) ,60,54 , PROMIS depression scale ( http : //www.nihpromis.org/ ) Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale ( CUDOS ) . Anxiety adult optionally measure self-report Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) , Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) , Social Phobia Inventory ( SPIN ) , Impact Event Scale ( IES ) , Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale ( CUXOS ) Cognitive Behavioural Avoidance Scale ( CBAS ) , PROMIS anxiety scale ( http : //www.nihpromis.org/ ) Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . Manic symptom optionally measure clinician-rated Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) self-report Altman Self-rated Mania Scale ( ASMS ) . Psychotic symptom optionally measure clinician-rated Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) . Severity suicidal ideation behaviour child adult measure paediatric adult version Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) . Status assessment : function The investigator assess current level functioning child youth widely use validate Columbia Impairment Scale ( CIS ) , parent youth report . CIS 13-item questionnaire provide global measure impairment score range 0 52 . Higher score indicate great level impairment . A score 15 high consider clinically significantly impair . In adult , investigator assess current level general , role- social functioning adult widely use validated clinician-rated 2-item Role Social Functioning Scales ( RSFS ) , self-report 5-item Work Social Adjustment Scales ( WSAS ) self-report 11-item Lam Employment Absence Productivity Scale ( LEAPS ) . New Measures New instrument developed measure two domains interest adequate establish measure identify : positive mood-related functioning acceptability preference pharmacological psychological treatment . Engagement Life Scale - self report ( ELS-SR ) self-report questionnaire develop base qualitative material include interviews individual different stage recovery depression clinician treat depression . It capture domains function identify related mood relevant quality remission depression . These domain include : enthusiasm , happiness , socialize , creativity , motivation , energy , interest , pleasure , decision-making , sense purpose , self-confidence , resilience hope . For example , individual clinically recover depression often note get depressed keen try new thing associate well , therefore , measure include item relate want try new thing start new activity . At present , measure developmental stage 50-item bank . The investigator propose collect response 400 participant obtain psychometric data allow shorten measure optimize efficiency avoid redundancy . Engagement Life Scale - clinician rat ( ELS-C ) . This 16-item clinician-rated scale cover domain self-report version ( enthusiasm , happiness , socialize , creativity , motivation , energy , interest , pleasure , decision-making , sense purpose , self-confidence , resilience hope ) . It administer semi-structured interview obligatory optional question rat accord provide anchor point . The added value clinician-rated version degree objectivity add clinician 's judgement . Like self-report version , scale undergo psychometric analysis likely refine shorten base result . Treatment acceptability preference questionnaire ( TAP-Q ) . Antidepressant medication structure psychological therapy ( cognitive behavioural therapy , CBT ) comparably effective treat depression relate condition . Many individual strong preference either pharmacological psychological treatment , establish way measure preference . Pre-existing attitude likely influence outcome treatment trial compare psychological pharmacological treatment . Therefore , investigator design measure start provide brief description typical first-line pharmacological psychological treatment , ask individual acceptability treatment , barrier acceptability , whether preference one treatment modality whether participant would willing receive one treatment chance ( randomly ) . The investigator obtain pilot data 60 participant , find measure clear easy complete . The investigator propose use measure 400 individual depression carry psychometric analysis establish rate treatment preference Nova Scotia . Patient-centered outcome While clinician may concern reduction symptom achieve remission , individual depression may her/his goal expectation treatment : e.g . one person good outcome may return busy career , others may ability read novel enjoy time grand child . A patient-centred outcome ( PCO ) recommend individual live experience depression aim measure achievement personalize treatment goal . PCO personalize content ( individual 's value treatment goal ) standardize scale ( 0-100 % goal achievement ) . PCO develop collaboratively patient goal-setting session patient name her/his value outcome help interviewer create specific anchor condition fulfil personally value outcome 25 % , 50 % , 75 % 100 % achieve . Physical health side-effects medication Unintended adverse reaction medication often concern express people live mental illness . Therefore , investigator offer measurement adverse reaction medication ( 'side-effects ' ) several self-report scale include Toronto Side Effects Scale ( TSES ) , Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist ( ASEC ) Sex Effects Scale ( SexFX ) . The three scale complement : TSES broad range symptom , ASEC add additional antidepressant-specific side effect assess probability association antidepressant , SexFX assess sexual side effect common well covered scale . In addition , database allow record routine health indicator include body weight , height , waist circumference , blood pressure , C-reactive protein ( measure systemic inflammation cardiovascular risk ) , triglyceride , cholesterol , glucose , insulin , glycated haemoglobin ( measure glucose metabolism ) . These indicator allow evaluate effect medication body weight , metabolic status cardiovascular risk . Data linkage The registry capacity link public health population databases use health card number . For participant provide consent data linkage , allow access additional information health service utilization , prescription diagnose additional assessment burden . In addition , allow obtain prospective information longevity cause death information participant lose follow-up . Release research data clinical use To fulfill mission CDRIN use research data improvement clinical care follow suggestion people live experience depression , registry participant able choose health-related information keep Registry send clinician . This may provide additional information , save time , spare participant answer question repeatedly , streamline clinical care enhance evidence-based practice . Information pass clinician explicit ( verbal write ) request participant . The information pass clinician take form single sheet concisely summarize diagnostic outcome information participant obtain far well tip possible treatment community resource . Mental-health communication specialist ( e.g . Healing Tree Communications ) review form pass clinician maximise usefulness minimize risk pass unhelpful confusing information . External communication specialist provide guidance design format generic feedback template . These communication specialist access information individual participant ( identify de-identified ) . Potential benefit Unlike ongoing research project , CDRIN Maritimes Registry become resource clinical care participant likely personally benefit participation project . Participants able request information collect Registry send clinician go see . Participants also send information exist community resource , peer support vocational service . The study involve reliability assessment instrument directly benefit participant , ensure instrument use assess diagnosis severity depression relate mental disorder reliable different psychiatrist clinician agree make diagnosis measure severity disorder . More accurate measurement improve fit individual 's problem prescribe treatment facilitate evidence-based practice . Training health professional use reliable diagnostic assessment instrument know improve quality clinical care . Routine systematic collection outcome information also facilitate evaluation specific treatment procedure , service change improvement initiative . This improve quality care depression mental disorder medium long term . Potential harm All propose procedure safe carry low-risk . The potential harm include burden repeat interview , upset content diagnostic interview inadvertent breach confidentiality . Burden repeat interview . The diagnostic interview time-consuming , last typically 90-120 minute . Repeating interview twice within short time perceive boring may put strain participant ' time resource . The investigator take participant ' time limitation seriously investigator take follow measure limit negative impact interview burden . The investigator inform participant advance likely duration interview emphasise free decide participate interview opt repeat interview change participation Registry . The investigator minimize time require interview efficient preparation interviewer training . The investigator reimburse participant travel expense time spend repeat interview . Upsetting interview . The diagnostic interview assessment instrument inevitably ask question upset participant . These include question symptom experience past , suicide attempt , hospital admission traumatic experience . Evidence show ask sensitive question harmful participant prefer discuss personally important issue sensitive professional rather avoid . The investigator minimize upset provide contain environment follow measure . All staff conduct interview clinical experience able contain upset sensitive responsible way . At begin interview , emphasise participant refuse answer specific question choose discontinue interview find upsetting . An on-call system involve investigator place bring psychiatrist participant judge upset risk self others judge acutely increase . Most investigator license psychiatrist clinical psychologist , attend short notice , provide crisis intervention arrange referral appropriate . Breaches confidentiality . In course study participant provide information highly sensitive since concern private experience , information mental health personal information include contact detail . The investigator maintain high standard confidentiality minimize potential harm breach confidentiality follow way . First , information directly allow identification subject [ name , address similar ] encode use alphanumeric code [ investigator use initial ] . Collected information keep secure relational database anonymized form alphanumeric code identify participant . Personal information , contact detail relationship alphanumeric code keep separate remainder data secure even high degree security [ keep password-protected file computer accessible principal investigator study coordinator ] . Even anonymized data accessible study investigator authorize staff Dalhousie University , Capital District Health Authority Izaac Walton Killam ( IWK ) Health Centre , directly link study familiar principle confidentiality personal data protection . Information necessary collaborative study make available known researcher academic institution sign transfer agreement include bind statement data confidentiality . All investigator require keep study relate data encrypted/password-protected file password-protected computer , take precaution prevent access unauthorized individual . No personally identifiable information make publicly available without separate REB approval participant 's consent . Balance benefit harm With outlined measure minimize foreseeable potential harm , investigator believe minimal risk harm participant outweigh expect direct benefit participant , benefit society advancement knowledge stem propose research . Future directions The investigator envisage Maritimes Depression Registry become long-term resource facilitate clinical research effort pioneer iterative use research information improvement clinical care service . The assessment instrument demonstrate reliability become part assessment research clinical purpose . Specific instrument assess positive aspect mood function treatment preference fill gaps assessment instrument . The registry become platform large-scale low-cost clinical trial . The registry infrastructure serve platform develop assess component incorporate EHR system expect implemented 2019 2021 .</detailed_description>
