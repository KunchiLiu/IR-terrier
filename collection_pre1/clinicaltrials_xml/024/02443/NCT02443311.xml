	<detailed_description>Lichen planus chronic , immunological , mucocutaneous disease , characterize period remission relapse1 . Oral lichen planus ( OLP ) one common mucocutaneous disease manifest oral cavity , oral mucosa may site involvement 2 , variable incidence 0.5 % 4 % 3 . Three major clinical form OLP ( reticular , erosive/ ulcerative , erythematous/atrophic ) recognize , could alternate overlap dynamic state disease progress . Ulceration severe form interferes eat , speech , swallow . Erosive OLP last year , resistance treatment spontaneous remission rare 4,5 . Oral lichen planus T-cell-mediated chronic inflammatory oral mucosal disease . Both antigen-specific non-specific mechanism may involve pathogenesis OLP . Antigen-specific mechanism include antigen presentation basal keratinocytes CD4+ helper T-cells stimulate secrete T helper -1 cytokines IL-2 IFN-Î³ . Subsequently , CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells may activate trigger basal keratinocyte apoptosis OLP . While , non-specific mechanism include mast cell degranulation matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activation OLP lesions 6 . The best known treatment OLP remain high-potency topical corticosteroids7 . However , corticosteroid know induce local atrophy , fragility , telangiectasias , promote infection , include acute candidiasis . They also theoretical risk lower local immunity , corticosteroid exert effect immune system modulate transcription gene cell involve immune response cell type ; therefore mode action selective pathogenesis lichen planus 8-10 . A recent Cochrane review show little evidence superiority assess intervention placebo palliation symptomatic OLP recommend need randomize clinical trial new therapy 11 . Pimecrolimus novel topical selective inflammatory cytokine release inhibitor ; bind intra-cytoplsmic protein ( macrophillin-12 ) subsequently inhibit dephosphorylation nuclear factor activate T cell calcineurin ; markedly reduce T-cell cytokine production . Given T-cell-mediated pathogenesis OLP , application calcineurin inhibitor seem promising therapeutic option 12-14 . Several case study open-label trial use topical pimecrolimus treatment OLP report beneficial effect 12,15 . Few prospective , randomize , vehicle-controlled study also conduct proved benefit pimecrolimus placebo 16,10,17 . And one recent prospective study compare effect topical pimecrolimus topical corticosteroid treatment OLP 18 . The purpose study compare effectiveness topical pimecrolimus 1 % topical corticosteroid , treatment oral erosive atrophic lichen planus prospective , comparative clinical trial .</detailed_description>
