	<brief_title>Feasibility New Pediatric Arm Rehabilitation Robot ChARMin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Children neurological diagnosis include congenital acquire brain lesion often impaired upper extremity function limit activity daily life independence . While several rehabilitation technology clinical routine apply improve upper extremity function patient , technology train severely affect child available far . Since 3 year , investigator work together Sensory-Motor Systems Lab ETH Zurich new robot platform specifically develop upper extremity therapy child ( 'Children 's Arm Rehabilitation Mechatronic Interface ' 'ChARMin ' ) . This group show recently single blind RCT adult upper extremity robot ARMin effective neurorehabilitation tool adult stroke ( especially severely affected patient ) . Now , ChARMin finish investigator would like study whether feasible apply prototype child adolescent undergo neurorehabilitation . Objective ( ) : As ChARMin specifically develop child adolescent , investigator first want explore whether feasible apply child adolescent undergo neurorehabilitation . Six study perform follow main objective : ( ) investigate applicability ( technical aspect , patient-related aspect , operability/handling robot , different control mode device , safety software interface ) ChARMin ; ( ii ) determine whether difference game score , kinematic kinetic metric provide ChARMin , additionally applied physiological measure adverse event differ participant train free non-supported mode , assist-as-needed mode fully guide mode ; ( iii ) determine psychometric property ( validity , reliability responsiveness ) assessment integrate ChARMin ; ( iv ) describe application system 30 participant evaluate concomitant change upper extremity motor function ( open label interventional study without control group ) ; ( v ) specific motor learn study 120 patient investigate whether child neurological diagnosis improve arm hand task performance repetitive training ChARMin , able retain improved level task performance task performance influence intervention ; ( vi ) perform ecological study monitoring safety , functional progress ( change ) application ChARMin 120 participant follow in- out-patient program ( comparable subproject iv ) . Outcome ( ) : The outcome line objective subproject . Some outcome measure specifically perform study ( e.g . safety , game score , assessment integrate ChARMin ) , others clinically routinely applied measure ( additional burden patient ) . The investigator apply invasive tool assure amount additional assessment limited keep burden participant acceptable . Study design : Most project open label interventional study investigate applicability , safety usability newly develop upper extremity robot ChARMin . Project ( ) investigate feasibility ChARMin 30 child adolescent . Project ( ii ) randomize study investigate difference various measure 3 control mode ChARMin . Project ( iii ) include psychometric study single measurement necessary ( validity ) , two repeat measurement perform ( within 3-7 day determine reliability onset end rehabilitation determine responsiveness ) . Project ( v ) consist motor learn study large number repetition perform relative short time determine change task performance , retention generalizability . Projects ( iv ) ( vi ) open label interventional study investigate application ChARMin concomitant change upper extremity function without control group . Measurements procedure : Participants position comfortable position chair . After required anthropometrics assess , ChARMin adjust cuff ChARMin fixate patient . Depending study , participant inform instructed task/assessment game make goal . Then , participant perform task , investigator/therapist answer question , make sure patient comfortable , control device , include emergency button . Afterwards , investigator/therapist loosen cuff assist need participant get chair . The therapist control participant 's skin ask sign discomfort . The duration session remain within 45 minute . In session , clinical routine assessment perform . Study Product / Intervention : The Children 's Arm Rehabilitation Mechatronic Interface ( ChARMin ) newly develop upper extremity exoskeleton robot assist single joint movement complex spatial reaching movement involve movement shoulder , elbow , wrist hand . As several subprojects perform , intervention could last single training session 45 minute , two three session ( example investigate reliability assessment ) longer train duration prescribe medical doctor ( e.g . several week 3-5 time per week , part intense rehabilitation program ) . Control Intervention ( applicable ) : NA ( subproject 2 : child control ) Number Participants Rationale : In general , investigator plan include 30 participant per project number would result less normal distribution , psychometric study , number participant need score psychometric study sufficient quality include best evidence synthesis . Subproject ( ) : 30 participant . Subproject ( ii ) : 30 participant . For subproject ( iii ) investigator plan recruit 60 participant ( least 2 measurement per participant ) . Likely , number might small participant agree undergo 3 assessment session ( first validity , second reliability final one responsiveness ) . Reference value obtain 40 healthy participant . Subproject ( iv ) : 30 participant . Subproject ( v ) : Pilot motor learn study perform 40 participant , definite motor learn study perform 80 participant . Subproject ( vi ) : 120 participant . Please note , participant likely contribute 1 subproject high burden . Therefore , total number patient therefore likely small 390 . Study Duration : 5 year Study Schedule : Month Year First-Participant-In ( Mai 2015 ) . Month Year Last-Participant-Out ( April 2020 ) Study Centre ( ) : Monocentric study : Rehabilitation Center Affoltern Albis Statistical Considerations : The investigator mainly report descriptive statistic . Normal distribution determine Shapiro-Wilk test . Comparisons two dependent group perform Wilcoxon 's paired-t-test . Comparisons two independent group perform Mann-Whitney U test Student 's t-test . Differences three group determine Friedman 's test ( dependent group ) ANOVA ( independent group ) . Relationships analyse Spearman 's Pearson correlation coefficient . Motor learn quantify various measure : learn adaptive rate fit power exponential regression ; ratio calculate quantify transfer retention block trial retention . GCP Statement : This study conduct compliance protocol , current version Declaration Helsinki , ICH-GCP ISO EN 14155 ( far applicable ) well national legal regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
