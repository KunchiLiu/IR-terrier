	<brief_title>Radiolabeled Study AG-221 Healthy Male Subjects .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , 2-part study healthy adult male ( n = 14 ) . Parts 1 2 may conduct parallel . Each subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase , follow phone call . Subjects met inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion screen return clinical site Day 1 baseline assessment . Part 1 : Absorption , metabolism , excretion ( AME ) Approximately 8 subject enrol Part 1 . Subjects check clinic day dose . Following 10 hour overnight fast , subject receive single 100-mg dose AG-221 solution contain microtracer [ 14C ] AG 221 ( ~ 300 nCi ) fast condition . The study drug administer oral solution approximately 240 mL room temperature , non-carbonated water . Blood , urine , fecal sample ( vomitus , applicable ) collect throughout study pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , mass balance , and/or clinical laboratory assessment . Safety monitor throughout study . Subjects discharge clinical site Day 22 follow completion require study procedure . Subjects return unit Day 29 last PK blood draw . Urine fecal sample collect day Day 22 ( point discharge earlier ) measurement total [ 14C ] radioactivity . Blood sample radioanalysis PK assessment , inclusive metabolite profiling/characterization , collect pre-dose specified interval Day 29 . Total [ 14C ] -radioactivity whole blood , plasma , urine , feces ( vomitus , applicable ) determine . Part 2 : Absolute bioavailability : Approximately 6 subject enrol Part 2 . Qualified subject meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion screen return clinical site Day 1 , house clinical site Day 1 Day 3 . After overnight fast least 10 hour , approximately 6 subject receive oral dose ( coated tablet ) 100 mg AG-221 Hour 0 dose day ( Day 1 ) . The study drug administer orally approximately 240 mL water . Four hour oral dose , subject receive 100 microgram AG-221 contain ~300 nCi [ 14C ] -AG-221administered intravenous bolus approximately 2 minute . Subjects discharge unit upon completion 48 hour PK blood draw Day 3 . Subjects return unit additional PK blood draw Days 5 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 29 . No urine fecal sample collect Part 2 .</detailed_description>
