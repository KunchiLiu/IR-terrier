	<brief_title>Circulating Cell-free Tumor DNA Plasma Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Demetri colleague present , AACR ASCO Annual Meeting 2013 , exploratory analysis ass GIST genotypes patient GRID study . Mutations KIT gene detect 58 percent blood sample compare 66 percent tumor tissue sample ( 31 ) . However , focus analysis secondary KIT mutation , mutation drive resistance target therapy like imatinib sunitinib , researcher find mutation 47 percent blood sample compare 12 percent tissue sample . In addition , nearly half blood sample secondary KIT mutation find , harbor multiple secondary mutation . Therefore , cf-DNA may become efficient marker mutational GIST status disease . On basis , trial aim evaluate whether tumor DNA carry mutation ( KIT , PDGFRÎ± , BRAF , RAS , SDH ) detect quantified plasma patient GISTs , either active disease follow-up , whether detection correlate disease status .</detailed_description>
