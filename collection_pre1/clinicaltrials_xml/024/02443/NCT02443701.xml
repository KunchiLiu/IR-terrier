	<brief_summary>Background : Volleyball player constantly perform vertical jump , high height jump well sport performance player . Several method test improve jumping performance player . It investigate addition electrical stimulation phototherapy jump train volleyball athlete . DESIGN : randomize controlled trial . METHODS : This study conduct 36 male athlete volleyball minimum experience 12 month sport . Will randomize assigned 3 group ( control group , NEMES group group phototherapy ) . All 36 healthy volleyball athlete pass initial selection agree participate study , conduct muscle strength jump training program , hold legs simultaneously . The 12 healthy athlete electrical stimulation group perform train program describe , strength training associate electrical stimulation . The 12 healthy athlete participate phototherapy group undergo phototherapy protocol perform strength jump training . All select participant undergo assessment muscle strength knee extensor evaluate jump . These evaluation baseline , 6 week 8 week baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Volleyball player constantly perform vertical jump , high height jump well sport performance player . Several method test improve jumping performance player . It investigate addition electrical stimulation phototherapy jump train volleyball athlete . DESIGN : randomize control trial METHODS This study conduct 36 male athlete volleyball minimum experience 12 month sport . Will randomize assigned 3 group ( control group , NEMES group group phototherapy ) .INTERVENTION All 36 healthy volleyball athlete pass initial selection agree participate study , conduct muscle strength jump training program , hold legs simultaneously . The training hold period six week frequency three time week , total 18 training . The interval one session another 24 hour . STRENGTH TRAINING To conduct train 36 healthy athlete , carry heat stationary bike six minute . After heat , individual position extension machine knee joint position 60 ° flexion hip 75 ° flexion , perform 10 repetition maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) , isometric contraction time 10 second rest time repetition 30 second . JUMPING TRAINING After train leg extension 36 individual remain rest 5 minute start jump training . One type jump train , countermovement jump ( SCM ) . SCM participant begin movement upright stand position , knees fully extend , volunteer bend knee 90 ° start movement jump . In jump training individual hold five set 10 repetition one minute interval series . ELECTRICAL STIMULATION The 12 healthy athlete electrical stimulation group perform train program describe , strength training associate electrical stimulation , medium frequency current ( 1kHz ) , Burst duration equal 2ms , modulate 70Hz , cycle Work 10 % T-on T-10 second 30 second intensity use vary accord capacity tolerable individual record later analysis . The stimulated muscle group quadriceps muscle , two self-adhesive electrode 8x13 cm ( area 104cm2 ) . An electrode place rectus femoris muscle region distance 20 cm anterior superior iliac crest position oblique vastus muscle region distance 5 cm superior pole patella . PHOTOTHERAPY The 12 healthy athlete participate phototherapy group undergo phototherapy protocol perform strength jump training . Phototherapy conduct cluster 03 diode 850nm wavelength follow parameter : Power 50mW diode , diode energy 2J , power per point 6J , total 36J per member . The irradiation time 40 point continuous mode . The laser apply stationary manner touch perpendicular skin . The application sit six point belly quadriceps muscle bilaterally . Evaluation monitor All select participant undergo assessment muscle strength knee extensor evaluate jump . These evaluation baseline , 6 week 8 week baseline . The maximum isometric muscle strength knee extensor quantify use hand dynamometer . To evaluate ability jump perform Jump Reach Test . The maximum amount countermovement jump perform 2 minute . The overall impression assess scale perceptation overall effect .</detailed_description>
