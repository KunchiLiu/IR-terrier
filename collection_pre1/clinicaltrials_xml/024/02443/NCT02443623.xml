	<detailed_description>This protocol conduct vaccinate plasma donor ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine thereby induce immune response result high anti-vaccinia antibody titer . The collection donor plasma use manufacturing Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous ( VIGIV ) . The objective protocol ensure safety plasma donor vaccinate ACAM2000 implementation risk factor screen procedure collection post-vaccination safety data . Participants follow duration study , expect average 90 day describe planned study assessment . Screening [ complete within 14 day Baseline ( Day 0 ) ] : - Informed consent obtain prospective donor - Post-consent information include medical history , smallpox vaccination history , current medication , detailed demographic , BMI , physical exam , vital sign , assessment pericarditis/myocarditis symptom , blood sample collect baseline EKG ( applicable ) . Baseline ( Day 0 ) prior vaccination : -Physical exam vital sign , urine pregnancy test female subject child-bearing potential , current medication , assessment pericarditis/myocarditis . Baseline ( Day 0 ) vaccination post-vaccination : -Vaccination ACAM2000 , vaccination site inspection 30 post-vaccination , unanticipated problem , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) , concomitant medication . Post-vaccination Day 3 ( ±1 ) : -Assessment pericarditis/myocarditis , vaccination site inspection , unanticipated problem , unexpected serious adverse reaction complication post-vaccination , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) . Post-vaccination Day 7 ( ±1 ) : -Assessment pericarditis/myocarditis symptom , urine pregnancy test , vaccination site inspection , unanticipated problem , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) , concomitant medication . Post-vaccination Day 12 ( ±2 ) , 21 ( ±3 ) , 28 ( ±3 ) : -Assessment pericarditis/myocarditis symptom , urine pregnancy test , vaccination site inspection , unanticipated problem , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) , concomitant medication . End study post-vaccination Day 35 ( ±3 ) Early Withdrawal : Vital sign , assessment pericarditis/myocarditis symptom , urine pregnancy test , vaccination site inspection , unanticipated problem , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) , concomitant medication . Final Safety Assessment Day 90 ( ±3 ) : Assessment pericarditis/myocarditis , unanticipated problem , unexpected serious adverse reaction complication post-vaccination , adverse event include cardiovascular adverse event ( symptom sign ) .</detailed_description>
