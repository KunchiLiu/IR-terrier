	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine small dose glucagon ( mini-dose glucagon ) effective treatment non-severe hypoglycemia adult type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mini-Dose Glucagon Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There three phase include study : ( 1 ) Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase , ( 2 ) Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) Crossover Trial Phase , ( 3 ) Post-Crossover Trial Phase . 1 . Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase : Prior commence crossover trial , study enrollment begin pilot phase 6 participant assess logistical safety issue . Participants screen visit follow 2 week home use mini-dose glucagon treat non-severe hypoglycemia prevent development hypoglycemia . At completion 2 week , clinic visit occur . Following completion pilot phase , study result assess determine whether change crossover trial protocol warrant . Participants pilot phase participate crossover trial eligibility criterion meet . 2 . Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) Crossover Trial Phase : The Crossover Trial Phase start run-in phase 48 participant 2 week follow two ( 3-week ) period crossover trial . The Crossover Trial Phase include 24 participant complete study period . Participants complete period least one event period may replace . During Crossover Trial Phase participant randomize two group : ( 1 ) Group A use mini-dose glucagon period 1 oral glucose tablet period 2 ( 2 ) Group B use oral glucose tablet period 1 mini-dose glucagon period 2 . Each group follow applicable treatment arm accord randomize group . 3 . Post-Crossover Trial Phase : The Post-Crossover Trial phase commence upon completion second 3-week period Crossover Trial Phase . Participants 3 week phase time decide use mini-dose glucagon glucose tablet treat non-severe hypoglycemia prevent hypoglycemia .</detailed_description>
