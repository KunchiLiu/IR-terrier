	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses ( AK ) common cutaneous lesion associate chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure . Ultraviolet radiation produce local systemic immunosuppression , mutation p53 tumor suppressor gene , deoxyribonucleic acid pyrimidine covalent dimmer , believe contribute dysplasia see AK . While authority consider AK pre-malignant lesion , consider incipient squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . The risk progression SCC individual AK reportedly low highly variable ; however , patient often multiple AKs , overall risk progression lifetime significant ; thus treatment AKs warrant . In addition , skin around clinically obvious AK lesion subject chronic ultraviolet exposure , result genetic damage mutation , result `` field cancerization . '' Subclinical AKs may progress clinical AKs , even de novo invasive SCCs . Among current therapy treatment AK excisional surgery , cryosurgery , electrodesiccation curettage , topical chemotherapy light therapy . Cryosurgery consider gold standard therapy , however lesion-directed therapy , cryosurgery treat subclinical lesion surround skin . Treated lesion clearance rate 3 month post-treatment double-freeze thaw cryotherapy report around 76-88 % ; however , new lesion treatment field include . Overall lesion clearance rate , include new subclinical lesion , approximately 5 month post-cryosurgery report 35-51 % . The inability treat subclinical lesion lesion-directed cryosurgery , spur emergence topical medication ingenol mebutate field-directed therapy . Ingenol mebutate active compound sap Euphorbia peplus L. ( E. peplus ) . The sap E. peplus long history community use topical treatment various skin condition , include AKs . Ingenol mebutate , gel formulation refer PEP005 ( ingenol mebutate ) Gel PEP005 Gel , evaluate clinical trial field therapy topical treatment AK photo damage skin lesion-specific treatment seborrheic keratosis non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) . The mechanism action ingenol mebutate AK therapy yet fully understood . In vivo vitro model demonstrate induction local lesion cell death promotion lesion-specific inflammatory response . A 0.015 % topical formulation approve treatment AKs US day three consecutive day regimen . Topical ingenol mebutate treatment may also reduce subclinical lesion treatment area , result few `` new '' AK lesion develop period time compare focal treatment . Phase III data demonstrate complete field clearance AKs 37-47 % face well sustained clearance approximately 50 % twelve month post treatment . Similarly randomize control study find mean reduction 83 % AK lesion face . 87.2 % AK 's treatment area baseline still clear 12 month later . Previous clinical study report mild moderate local adverse event ( AE ) pruritus , pain , irritation local skin response ( LSR ) ( eg erythema , flaking , scale ) . The unpleasant often unsightly localize skin irritation emotionally difficulty patient provoke anxiety . It unknown whether large inflammatory reaction necessary successful treatment actinic keratosis ingenol mebutate 0.015 % . Currently , clinical study evaluate combination therapy ( eg topical steroid , barrier cream , etc . ) ingenol mebutate 0.015 % would decrease irritation maintain efficacy .</detailed_description>
