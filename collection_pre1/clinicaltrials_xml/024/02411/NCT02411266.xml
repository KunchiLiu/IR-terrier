	<brief_summary>In remote preconditioning , ischemia one organ protect distant organ ischemic insult . e.g . brief induced limb ischemia protect brain otherwise severe stroke . The investigator propose study limb precondition subject subarachnoid hemorrhage high risk cerebral ischemia first 2 week hemorrhage . The investigator previously show 3x 10min leg conditioning cycle tolerate appear safe . The investigator continue assess safety intervention enrol additional 60 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preconditioning With Limb Ischemia Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll patient subarachnoid hemorrhage , generally high risk ischemic stroke 2 week follow initial bleed , patient clip coiled aneurysm . The study intervention consist application blood pressure cuff around subject arm leg use interrupt circulation arm leg 10 minute . This repeat total 3 time every 24 48 hour 14 day . The cuff inflate 10 minute deflate 5 minute . There 3 cycle . The cuff inflate 200mmHg . The primary endpoint safety nature define follow : 1 . If prolong upper low extremity application blood pressure cuff induce tissue breakdown , ischemic injury musculoskeletal injury patient withdrawn study . 2 . If subject wish continue limb precondition discomfort pain . 3 . Any unexplained neurological deterioration carefully review etiology ascertain . If temporally coincide precondition stimulus least 2 occasion patient withdrawn study . 4 . Any unexplained cardiovascular event ( myocardial ischemia , chest pain , hypotension ) carefully monitor etiology review . Any temporal association pre-conditioning protocol examine . 5 . Deep vein thrombosis . Patients subarachnoid hemorrhage high incidence deep vein thrombosis . It difficult determine due intervention . The investigator carefully monitor deep vein thrombosis precondition leg compare incidence non-preconditioned leg . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) make final adjudication relation precondition procedure development deep vein thrombosis .</detailed_description>
