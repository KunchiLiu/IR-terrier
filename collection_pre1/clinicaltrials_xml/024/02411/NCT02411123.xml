	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Patient Outcomes Following Pharmacogenetic Testing Subjects Exhibiting Neuropsychiatric Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-depressant anti-anxiety medication still administer trial error method , result substantial number patient suffer either lack benefit drug therapy severe side effect . Approximately 40 % anti-depressant anti-anxiety medication prescribe ineffective , patient need medication often discontinue take medication , potentially dangerous consequence . Clinical feature often fail predict drug response tolerability patient prescription medication . Genetics help guide therapeutic decision patient exhibit neuropsychiatric disorder improve patient outcome maximize drug efficacy minimize risk adverse event . Genetics drug interaction alter pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics multitude drug compound turn influence safety efficacy select therapeutic regimen . Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection use IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel enhance patient response tolerability facilitate selection appropriate medication effective dose short possible time . In prospective , randomize , single-blind study , new patient present clinical site evidence depression anxiety determine qualified clinician invite participate . Study participant randomize one two group respect IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result : group test result reveal medical provider prior treatment selection ( Experimental Group ) group without test result prior treatment selection ( Control Group ) . Participant outcome measure baseline throughout 4-month duration study .</detailed_description>
