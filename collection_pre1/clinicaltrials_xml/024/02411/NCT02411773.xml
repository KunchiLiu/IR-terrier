	<detailed_description>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) suffer exercise intolerance poor physical capacity contributes increase cardiovascular risk patient population . Prior study show CKD patient exaggerated increase blood pressure ( BP ) static rhythmic exercise . Such abnormal hemodynamic response exercise contribute poor physical capacity abnormal muscle blood flow exercise patient . The goal project investigate mechanism potential therapy target abnormal hemodynamic response exercise CKD examine role impaired vasodilation , exaggerated vasoconstriction .</detailed_description>
