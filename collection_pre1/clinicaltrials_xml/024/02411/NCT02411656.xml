	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 ( +/- 3 day ) 21-day cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Cycles 3 , every 3rd cycle ( Cycles 6 , 9 , 12 , ) , disease get bad , blood ( 10 tablespoon ) draw biomarker immune system test . About every 2 Cycles , image scan check status disease part standard care . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 month , long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 10 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You image scan screen check status disease . Follow-Up : About 1 3 month last dose study drug , ask health side effect may . You may ask routine clinic visit may call . If call , call last 2 minute . This investigational study .
