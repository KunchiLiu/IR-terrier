	<brief_summary>Simulation train surgical education Urology specialist training flexible cystoscopy demonstrate valid efficient learn instrument . The classical setup medical expert introduce novice theoretical background technics procedure time-consuming expensive . Directed self-regulated simulation training ( DSR ) validate method simulation training . The power test DSR flexible cystoscopy knowledge know . We introduce setup novice start train direct self-regulated simulation training environment inform would test medical expert afterwards . The intervention group novice give write theoretical information anatomical picture . The control group first give classical oral theoretical introduction medical expert secondly DSR training . We test outcome intervention validate rating scale flexible cystoscopy . The novice control intervention group test patient prescribe flexible cystoscopy evaluate specialist Urology . The main hypothesis test relation DSR would result high score validate scale perform flexible cystoscopy patient evaluate specialist Urology compare group oral lecture DSR .</brief_summary>
