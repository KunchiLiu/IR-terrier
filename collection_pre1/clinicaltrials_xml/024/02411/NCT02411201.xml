	<brief_summary>The main purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics DOTAREM® body child age less 2 year thanks several blood sample ( 3 ml total ) take follow administration DOTAREM® . DOTAREM® contrast agent commonly use enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) potentially improve quality image help diagnosis . Children age less 2 year schedule undergo routine gadolinium-enhanced MRI body region may take part study . In case receive DOTAREM® , solution inject standard dose 0.2mL/kg ( 0.1 mmol/kg ) body weight .</brief_summary>
