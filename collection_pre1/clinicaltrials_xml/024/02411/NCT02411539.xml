	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety , Tolerability , Effect Human Monoclonal Antibody ( VRC01 ) Markers HIV Persistence HIV-Infected Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) develop treatment variety condition include cancer , autoimmune disorder , infection . mAbs may also potential treatment people infect HIV . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability experimental human mAb , VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) , HIV-infected adult receive ART . Study researcher also evaluate effect VRC01 number infect cell contain unspliced HIV-1 transcript blood participant . This study enroll HIV-infected people 18 65 year old , receive ART least 2 year CD4+ count 200 cells/mm^3 great . Participants randomly assign Arm A Arm B . Participants Arm A receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion VRC01 Day 0 Week 3 IV infusion placebo Weeks 6 9 . Participants Arm B receive IV infusion placebo Day 0 Week 3 IV infusion VRC01 Weeks 6 9 . Participants record temperature symptom 3 day infusion . Study visit occur study entry ( Day 0 ) , Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 30 . Study visit include physical examination , clinical assessment , blood collection .</detailed_description>
