	<detailed_description>MR examination perform 3.0 Tesla GE whole-body scanner use elliptically drive body coil transmit multi-channel bilateral breast coil receive . The multi-channel coil consist 8 , 16 31 channel . DCE-MRI : DCE-MRI carry use three-dimensional ( 3D ) turbo fast lowangle gradient echo sequence ( TFE ) combine parallel acquisition Sensitivity Encoding ( SENSE ) technique . The image plane set axial plane breast include image . One image acquire four image acquire intravenous administration standard dose 0.1 mmol per kg body weight Gadavist ( Schering AG , Germany ) rate 3ml/sec . subject prone position , breathe normally scan . The total scan time DCEMRI 8 minute . Pharmacokinetic parameter , include volume transfer constant Ktrans , fractional volume extravascular extracellular space target tissue , rate constant kep , estimate fitting pharmacokinetic model time-intensity curve obtain DCE-MRI . In study , concentration tracer Ct ( ) bolus injection assume obey model propose Tofts Kermode ( 20 ) . DWI-MRI examination : The DWI acquisition occur and/or contrast enhancement use DCE image . Immediately completion image 16 ( 31 ) channel breast coil , patient reposition replace breast coil 8 channel breast coil additional DWI acquisition make . Data apparent diffusion coefficient assessment diffusion-weighted imaging acquire use single-shot Echo Planar Imaging sequence transverse plane . The DWI protocol acquire image 16 different b value . Slice dependent shimming perform provide maximum B0 homogeneity slice . The total scan time DWI-MRI 5 minute . All DWI image data MRI examination store dedicated HIPPA compliant computer workstation ( located room NE6.114 ) analysis . The relevant parameter mean ADC histogram ADC lesion . Conductivity imaging : A B1 map spin echo image acquire measure tissue conductivity ( 21 ) . The image use conductivity measurement anonymized sent manufacturer development post-processing technique .</detailed_description>
