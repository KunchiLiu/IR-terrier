	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) lead cause death among hospitalized patient , important patient safety issue plastic surgery . Previous work plastic surgery show enoxaparin prophylaxis prevent many post-operative VTE event , current American Society Plastic Surgeons guideline support enoxaparin prophylaxis high-risk patient . However , Plastic Surgery Foundation-funded Venous Thromboembolism Prevention Study show one 25 high risk patient still `` breakthrough '' VTE event despite receipt guideline-compliant enoxaparin prophylaxis . Highest risk patient often cancer trauma reconstruction . These surgery may surgical injury equal scope patient traumatic thermal injury . Previous work patient traumatic thermal injury show enoxaparin metabolism , measure anti-factor Xa ( aFXa ) level , substantially increase : high degree injury associate high enoxaparin dose requirement achieve prophylactic level . `` Breakthrough '' VTE event may occur plastic reconstructive surgery patient due inadequate enoxaparin dosing . The investigator examine enoxaparin pharmacokinetics test whether clinical protocol real-time enoxaparin dose adjustment favorably alter proportion patient in-range aFXa level . Primary outcome include 1 ) peak trough steady-state aFXa level response standard escalate dos enoxaparin 2 ) proportion patient appropriate aFXa level initiation clinical protocol enoxaparin dose adjustment . The investigator expect standard dose result inadequate aFXa peak trough level , clinical dose adjustment protocol significantly improve proportion in-range aFXa level . The investigator also develop linear regression-based equation calculate , base patient-level factor , require dose enoxaparin generate in-range aFXa level . This research may show current `` one size fit '' approach enoxaparin prophylaxis insufficient . In trauma orthopaedic population , patient low initial aFXa level significantly likely develop DVT . Thus , research important implication appropriate enoxaparin dose magnitude frequency , may ultimately help decrease substantial morbidity mortality associate post-operative VTE .</brief_summary>
