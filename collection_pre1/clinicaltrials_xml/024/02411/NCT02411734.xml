	<brief_title>Effect Executive Dysfunction Rehabilitation Potential</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale : Many patient hospitalized benefit rehabilitation discharge . Rehabilitation may provide one several setting , include home , nursing home facility specialize rehabilitation . Success rehabilitation depend patient 's ability willingness cooperate rehabilitation staff . Unfortunately , patient follow rehabilitation protocol . If participate rehabilitation least 90 minutes/day , discharge rehabilitation facility . It would useful able predict patient problem rehabilitation admit acute care set . In study , investigator test hypothesis executive function important achieve rehabilitation goal . 2 . Background : Executive function set mental process help connect past experience present action . People use perform activity plan , organize , strategizing , pay attention remember detail , managing time space . Executive function important factor level care elderly individual require ( Royall , Chiodo , &amp; Polk , 2005 ) . This study also find many elderly individual impair executive function even though normal cognitive function . Executive function also related functional ability individual mild dementia ( Martyr &amp; Clare , 2012 ) . 3 . The research question : The hypothesis test study rehabilitation potential decrease person impaired executive function . The purpose study attempt development screen tool could use patient admitted rehabilitation . Results screen would alert rehabilitation facility possible problem occur patient admit rehabilitation . If test show patient 's executive function impair , rehabilitation result may improve treatment impairment ( Royall et al. , 2009 ) . 4 . Study design : During admission patient , Dennise Fernandez ask patient state need rehabilitation . If able state reason , Dennise Fernandez explain study patient interested give him/her Informed Consent Form . If patient unable state reason rehabilitation , study explain his/her proxy inform consent give proxy . The patient/proxy time read Informed Consent his/her ask question he/she may . It patient/proxy sign Informed Consent , Dennise Fernandez ask old patient patient ask complete Trail Making Tests . Both part Trail Making Test consist 25 circle distribute sheet paper . In Part A , circle numbered 1 - 25 , patient draw line connect number ascend order . In Part B , circle include number ( 1 - 13 ) letter ( A - L ) ; Part A , patient draw line connect circle ascend pattern , add task alternate number letter ( i.e. , 1-A-2-B-3-C , etc. ) . The patient instruct connect circle quickly possible , without lift pen pencil paper . Time patient connects `` trail . '' If patient make error , point immediately allow patient correct . Errors affect patient 's score correction error include completion time task . It unnecessary continue test patient complete part five minute elapse . Step 1 : Give patient copy Trail Making Test Part A worksheet pen pencil . Step 2 : Demonstrate test patient use sample sheet ( Trail Making Part A - SAMPLE ) . Step 3 : Time patient follow `` trail '' make number test . Step 4 : Record time . Step 5 : Repeat procedure Trail Making Test Part B . Scoring : Results TMT A B report number second require complete task ; therefore , high score reveal great impairment . The patient participate therapy stay , participation evaluate ) amount time participate therapy day , b ) need encouragement staff participate . Encouragement rat four point scale : ) encouragement , ii ) minimal encouragement , iii ) moderate encouragement , iv ) maximum encouragement . 72 hour prior discharge , ask Dennise Fernandez complete Trail Making Tests . 5 . Sample size : 100 patient 6 . Study population : All admit patient meet inclusion criterion approach 100 sign Informed Consent Form . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Admitted rehabilitation 2 . 65 year old old 3 . Speaks English Exclusion criterion : 1 . Unable read ( even glass ) 2 . Unable write 7 . The expected result research : Results study publish scientific journal . If result positive , scale develop inform rehabilitation facility rehabilitation potential patient he/she admit rehabilitation . 8 . Principal Investigator : Ladislav Volicer , MD , PhD 9 . Potential risk subject : The research influence rehabilitation patient . The risk may become frustrated difficulty accomplish Trail Making Tests . 10 . Experimental Procedures : Administration Trail Making Tests record duration rehabilitation possible need encouragement . Results Trail Making Test correlate level participation therapy . 11 . Potential benefit subject : None 12 . Human subject consideration : Informed consent give patient express interest research one day decide want sign . If patient explain reason his/rehabilitation , study explain his/her proxy proxy receive inform consent form . Each patient receive PIN research protocol identify PIN . The master list connect PINs name keep rehabilitation facility employee , Dennise Fernandez . 13 . The study great minimal risk .</detailed_description>
