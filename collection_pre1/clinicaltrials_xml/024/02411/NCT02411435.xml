	<brief_summary>CAB integrase inhibitor currently Phase 2 clinical trial treatment prevention human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) infection . RIF , rifamycin use treatment tuberculosis ( common co-infection HIV-infected subject ) , know inducer uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) . CAB primarily metabolize via UGT1A1 UGT1A9 , thus drug interaction CAB RIF possible . This study phase I , single-center , open label , fixed-sequence cross-over study compare single dose PK CAB oral 30 milligram ( mg ) co-administered RIF 600 mg daily steady-state CAB oral 30 mg administer alone . Fifteen subject plan enrol obtain 12 evaluable subject study .</brief_summary>
