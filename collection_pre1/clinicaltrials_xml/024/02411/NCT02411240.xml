	<brief_summary>Short-term chronic exposure ambient level particulate matter ( PM ) associate increased morbidity mortality relate respiratory cardiovascular disease . Proposed biological pathway imply particle-induced inflammation play role activate vascular endothelium alter vascular function . Accumulating evidence suggest outdoor air pollution significant impact central nervous system health disease live condition elevate air pollution link decreased cognitive function . Only recently show reduction ambient level PM2.5 associate improvement life expectancy . However , study beneficial effect improve indoor air quality healthy human lack . With project investigator intend study effect room clean air elderly emphasis cardiovascular cognitive function . The investigator hypothesise mean air cleaning , control reduced exposure positive effect cardiovascular parameter blood pressure , heart rate variability , macro- microcirculation neurobehavioral function . The investigator substantiate outcome potential mechanism action transcript epigenetic level hematological parameter , marker inflammation , lipid protein oxidation product mitochondrial DNA damage . To achieve goal specific need study elderly , appear elevate susceptibility large attributable risk relate indoor PM , spend time indoors . Suited concept study location elderly home ( `` service flat '' ) retirement home . The `` ELiFA '' -cohort stand Elderly Living Filtered Air consist intervention study 2-week period pre-purification ( baseline ) , active purification post purification period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study Population Design Persons live `` service flat '' retirement home healthy elderly respectively live semi-independently dependently . The elderly home locate Flanders , Belgium . Persons include 65 year old , bedridden , non- smoker able give inform consent . This selection make basis mental state candidate participant , primary selection base advice director head nurse elderly home . A documented minimental state examination ( MMSE ) perform participation candidate depend priori determine criterion ( score 23 ) ability possible participant perform NES test ( cognitive test ) , do priori enrolment . The project design intervention study total 6 week , start baseline pre-purification period , 2-week active purification period 2-week post purification period . Each participant his/her control , exclude confound factor stable within individual time vary participant . The device ( GENANO tube , GENANO Benelux ; Heusen-Zolder , België ) place living room apartment study period . These kind air purification device use medical setting ( cleanrooms , medical practice ) give u opportunity create well-controlled experimental real life set . Ultra fine particle ( UFP ) ( Aerasense , Philips ) , PM10-2.5 total suspend particulate ( TSP ) ( Aerocet , MetOne ) monitor . Blood urine sample every week morning hour per participant avoid problem due diurnal variation . The participant ask fill questionnaire . For duration study , investigator ask participant keep window close . 2 . Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint focus change cardiovascular en neurobiological function . 2.1 Cardiovascular function . The cardiovascular measurement conduct non-invasively wide range order comprehensively study effect . 2.1.1 . Microvasculature : After pupillary dilation , digital image retinas obtain use digital retinal camera ( Canon CR-2 Digital Retinal Camera ) . 2.1.2 . Macro vasculature : The distensibility intermedia thickness carotid artery measure echo-graphical imaging esaote MY LAB ™ ONE mobil device . 2.1.3.Heart rate variability : With mobile ECG sensor ( Biopatch , Zephyr ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) continuously monitor several 24h period 3 phase study . 2.1.4 . Blood pressure : Using Stabil-O-Graph device blood pressure determine 5 consecutive time every time point . 2.2 Cognitive function The investigator assess neurobehavioral function Neurobehavioral Evaluation System ( NES-3 ) . Neurobehavioral Evaluation System ( NES ) computerise battery test develop study neurological effect exposure environmental agent . The investigator use digit span test , continuous performance Stroop test . 3 . Secondary Endpoints The investigator delineate outcome secondary endpoint find potential mechanism action transcript epigenetic level haematological parameter , marker inflammation lipid protein oxidation product mitochondrial DNA damage . 3.1 . Transcriptomics Epigenetics The investigator study underlie mechanism either full transcriptome analysis gene specific transcription pattern well specific hypothesis drive microRNA study . Epigenetic profile study gene specific methylation sequencing . 3.2 . Haematological measurement , marker inflammation , oxidative stress . The investigator measure hemoglobin , red blood cell , fibrinogen , platelet , coagulation factor ( II + VII + X ) , IL-6 urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxo-dG ) . 3.3 . Mitochondrial DNA damage The investigator measure mitochondrial DNA content relative nuclear DNA mean qPCR , measure DNA damage give indication need repair mitochondrial DNA damage . As parameter early sensor DNA-damage sample collect whole blood tube .</detailed_description>
