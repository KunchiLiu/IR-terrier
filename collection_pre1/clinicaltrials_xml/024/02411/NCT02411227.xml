	<brief_summary>Background : - People traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) problem think everyday activity . They may higher risk car accident . NeuroDRIVE use virtual reality drive simulator . Researchers think help test improve people think drive TBI . Objective : - To test NeuroDRIVE affect brain performance drive safety . Eligibility : - People least 18 year old history TBI driver license point . They must speak , read , write English physically able drive . Design : - Participants ask release driving record , study . - Visit 1 : Screening physical exam . - Visit 2 : Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants lie table slide cylinder strong magnetic field . A device place head . Participants may computer task scan . - Participants test memory , attention , think . They may ask question , take test , simple action . - Visit 3 : Tests memory , attention , thinking , plus virtual reality drive assessment . - Participants assign Group 1 start NeuroDRIVE training immediately Group 2 start 10 week later . - Visits 4 9 , 4 week : - Participants practice drive skill mental exercise simulator . - They complete drive questionnaire online week . - Visit 10 : Repeat Visit 3 , small change . - Visits 11-12 : Very similar Visits 1-2 . Includes MRI scan ; physical exam ; questionnaire ; test think , memory , attention.. - After Visit 12 : Participants fill weekly driving survey online 4 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study evaluate NeuroDRIVE behavioral intervention enhancement drive ability , cognitive ability , neurobehavioral symptom traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . For purpose protocol , NeuroDRIVE refers novel combine approach drive train cognitive rehabilitation virtual reality environment . While NeuroDRIVE utilize VR system method intervention administer , NeuroDRIVE VR system . STUDY POPULATION : 30 adult patient history mild TBI 30 adult patient history moderate-to-severe TBI . Participants recruit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , WRNMMC , broad community . DESIGN : The current study Clinical Trial Phase II interventional research study . The primary purpose study treatment , employ parallel intervention model . There mask ( i.e. , open label ) . Participants classify two group TBI severity : history mild TBI history moderate-tosevere TBI . These different severity know distinct cognitive sequela . Within severity group , participant 2 ( pre-post ) x 2 ( treatment vs. wait list ) experimental design . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome measure include : - Results Virtual Reality Driving Assessment ( baseline postintervention Tactical scenario composite score ) - Total score Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory - Standard scale score follow cognitive assessment ( TBI Common Data Elements identify NINDS ) : WAIS-IV WMS-IV Digit Span subtest WAIS-IV Digit-Symbol Coding subtest Secondary outcome measure include : -Neuroimaging result : Regions Interest FMRI : Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Regions Interest DTI : Corpus callosum , bilateral frontal white matter horn , bilateral longitudinal fasciculus -Total score follow symptom questionnaire : Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended ( GOS-E ) Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Brief Symptom Inventory- 18 Satisfaction Life Scale ( SWLS ) PTSD Checklist- Civilian ( PCL-C ) SF-36v2 Health Survey ( SF-36v2 ) Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) Combat Exposure Scale ( CES ) Dual Dangerous Driving Index ( DDDI ) -Standard scale score follow cognitive phenotyping assessment ( TBI Common Data Elements identify NINDS ) : California Verbal Learning Test- Second Edition ( CVLT-II ) WAIS-IV Symbol Search subtest Medical Symptom Validity Test ( MSVT ) -Standard scale score follow additional cognitive phenotyping assessment : Trail Making Test ( TMT ) Test Premorbid Functioning ( ToPF ) Grooved Pegboard Controlled Oral Word Association Test ( COWAT ) Bethesda Eye Attention Measure ( BEAM )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects eligible participation must meet following criterion : 1 . Currently valid driver license , valid driver license prior injury 2 . 18 year age old 3 . Able effectively manipulate steer wheel gas/brake pedal without adaptive equipment 4 . Able read , write , speak English 5 . History traumatic brain injury great 12 week prior initiation current study 6 . Able provide inform consent 7 . NBSI score great equal 16 ( Mild TBI subgroup ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects eligible participation follow condition exist : 1 . Risk injury MRI magnet , include : Pacemakers implant electrical device . Brain stimulators . Some type dental implant . Aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) . Metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) . Permanent eyeliner ( nonmetallic tattoo permissible ) . Implanted delivery pump . Shrapnel fragment . Welders metal worker also risk injury possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . Fear confine space . Back problem may result back pain discomfort lie scanner . Weight 350 pound , due weight limit MRI table . It known MRI completely safe develop fetus . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform 24 hour MRI scan . The scan do pregnancy test positive . Because neuroimaging key component current study , inability participate MRI scan necessary exclusion criterion . 2 . History penetrate brain injury 3 . History serious medical condition TBI could affect cognitive motor ability ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , encephalitis , cerebrovascular disease ) 4 . History severe motion sickness and/or vertigo . 5 . Other medical psychological instability could create difficulty fulfil study requirement ( e.g. , untreated mental illness , auditory/visual hallucination , narcolepsy ) To verify information , study coordinator request medical record ( i.e. , recent medical history , medication list , neuroimaging , record pertinent participant recent injury ) evaluate potential participant inclusion study . Medical record obtain three way : 1 . Participants bring record come NIH testing ; make clear bring information verify meet inclusion criterion , potential participant enrol study day . 2 . Alternatively , participant also fax medical record secure fax machine Recreational Therapy office NIH access permit study staff ( i.e. , scheduler , physician , nurse psychologist ) . 3 . Participants may also fill medical release document submit study coordinator . Medical history data review , clear patient meet inclusion criterion , contact cancel appointment . Data obtain manner may use evaluate participant eligibility ; however , use research purpose . Additionally , patient deem eligible participate , medical history data destroy accordance NIH regulation . As condition receive funding CNRM , deidentified image phenotyping data ( i.e. , neurocognitive test result behavioral questionnaire ) fund study must make available within centralized repository ( CNRM Informatics Core ) one year completion study . This intended facilitate use analysis data future research question project . As , potential subject inform participate study want data use project .</criteria>
