	<brief_title>Effect Adjunctive Misoprostol Treatment Blood Loss Vaginal Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Some maternal blood loss normally occurs time vaginal delivery . The best estimate indicate loss approximately 500 mL average , range 250-700 mL . [ 1,2 ] Some bleeding arises birth canal laceration surgical incision ( i.e. , episiotomy ) , derive vessel expose uterine wall placental site placenta separate . Under normal circumstance , shortly placental separation intense myometrial contraction occur . These raise pressure within myometrial wall blood pressure vessel traverse , vessel open intervillous space . Flow vessel thus mechanically attenuated myometrial contraction , allow formation intravascular thrombus . This mechanism control postpartum uterine blood loss work well time . If , however , uterus remain hypotonic atonic delivery , excessive blood loss occur . In bad case , severe uterine hemorrhage ensues . Postpartum hemorrhage , fact , lead cause maternal mortality world , account least 100,000 death annually . [ 3 ] Even absence frank hemorrhage , postpartum blood loss result maternal anemia . Recuperation iron store recover blood loss take time , may occur , especially low socioeconomic area dietary iron consumption often deficient , pregnancy tend occur close succession . Postpartum anemia significant contributor short- long-term morbidity . [ 5-7 ] It increase risk infection poor wound heal . Also , associate fatigue may interfere mother 's ability administer child care bond appropriately infant . Anemic mother tend difficulty nursing , may produce iron-deficient milk . There thus strong rationale minimize postpartum blood loss . In US hospital , parturients receive high dose intravenous intramuscular oxytocin immediately delivery . This approach show several study reduce risk postpartum hemorrhage , [ 8-11 ] practice routinely Queens Hospital Center . Investigators employ intravenous infusion oxytocin ( Pitocin® ) rate 50-100 mU/minute . Despite approach , still substantial blood loss delivery , base investigator 's preliminary observation show . This provide rationale determine whether use adjunctive drug , namely misoprostol 600 µg rectally , administer delivery , might reduce blood loss oxytocin alone , thus decrease risk morbidity relate postpartum anemia . Preliminary Data The investigator examine hemograms randomly choose consecutive sample 53 spontaneous vaginal delivery perform Queens Hospital Center September 15 October 1 , 2010 . Among patient , admission hemoglobin concentration 11.9±1.2 g/dL first postparutum day 10.9±1.3 . The mean fall 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.74 , 1.29 ) , statistically significant decrease ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . Hematocrit level fell parallel , average 7.8 % predelivery value . The mean fall hemoglobin hematocrit level delivery ( 1.02 g/dL 2.81 % ) consistent average blood loss 500 mL . The consistency change small associate variance indicate change hemoglobin hematocrit level meaningful proxy assessment blood lose vaginal delivery . Study Design The study prospective randomize open-label clinical trial perform single institution . It compare intrapartum postpartum maternal blood hemoglobin concentration hematocrit measurement group parturients receive standard prophylactic intravenous oxytocin immediately delivery group receive oxytocin adjuvant misoprostol . Sample size analysis A total 800 subject enter two-treatment parallel design study . With sample size , probability 90 % study detect treatment difference two-sided 0.05 significance level difference hemoglobin concentration treatment 0.3 g/dL . This analysis base assumption standard deviation postpartum intrapartum hemoglobin concentration large 1.3 g/dL . Comparison intrapartum postpartum hemoglobin hematocrit level do use paired t-test . A probability level 0.05 use threshold significance . Inclusion exclusion criterion This study include adult pregnant woman regardless age . Pregnant minor age 18 eligible . A patient consider inclusion study meet follow criterion : - She term ( ≥37 complete week ) live singleton gestation cephalic presentation admit Labor Delivery Unit - She latent phase labor admit induction labor prenatal clinic visit - She few four prior vaginal delivery . - She report allergy misoprostol . The following factor condition exclude patient consideration subject : - The fetus know major fetal malformation chromosome abnormality - The gestation multiple . - There breech malpresentation - The patient report involvement another clinical trial currently previously pregnancy . - The patient expect cesarean delivery . - The patient prior cesarean delivery . - There intrauterine fetal death . - There polyhydramnios ( amniotic fluid index &gt; 22 cm ) . - Presence acute chronic renal disease - Presence preeclampsia Of subject enter study , development certain condition exclude post hoc receive misoprostol protocol , data analysis . These condition include : - Unanticipated cesarean delivery . - Performance episiotomy ( third fourth degree extension exclude ) . - Vaginal cervical laceration , perineal laceration second degree depth . - Severe postpartum hemorrhage require intervention immediately delivery . - Uterine rupture - Placental abruption . - Patient withdrawal consent . Recruitment Consent Procedures Patients meet inclusion criterion study identify prenatal clinical visit , early latent-labor , prior induction labor active labor . Informed consent obtain one investigator . Consent obtain prior active labor . The informed consenting process initiate among patient active labor . Patients recruit consented consent document approve IRB . Patient recruitment commence IRB approval obtain . Once subject consent participate study , determine investigator whether patient receive oxytocin alone oxytocin misoprostol . Both drug formulary available Labor Delivery Unit immediate use . Randomization A computer-generated table random number use assign recruited subject group . A locked file maintain Labor Delivery area . The file contain series sequentially-numbered sealed envelope . Each envelope contain card randomly generate number . These number take order computer-generated list . The investigator choose next envelope sequence . If contains odd number , patient assign intervention group receive oxytocin misoprostol . If envelope contain even number , patient assign `` oxytocin '' group . Characteristics Medication Nature misoprostol Misoprostol synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog . It market primarily drug prevent development gastric ulcer associate use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , part Queens Hospital Center formulary . Originally market Cytotec® , misoprostol available generic form tablet contain contain either 100 µg 200 µg . Misoprostol protect gastric mucosa several mechanism . It also property stimulate myometrial smooth muscle contraction . [ 12 ] That effect result drug 's common use obstetrics termination pregnancy , cervical ripen prior induction labor , large dos , prevention treatment postpartum hemorrhage uterine atony . [ 13-19 ] Misoprostol administer oral , sublingual , vaginal rectal route . It well absorb mode administration , detailed pharmacokinetic data exist primarily concern oral administration . It rapidly absorb , undergoes prompt de-esterification free acid , responsible clinical activity . Peak plasma level oral administration occur 10-15 min . The half-life 20-40 minute . The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation follow reduction ketone give prostaglandin F analog . Excretion primarily urine . Very little misoprostol appear breast milk . [ 20,21 ] After single 600 µg oral dose misoprostol nursing mother , misoprostol acid excrete breast milk . One hour dosing , milk concentration 67 % maternal serum level ; five hour , misoprostol concentration breast milk decline &lt; 1 pg/mL . While specific data exist misoprostol concentration colostrum , give small ingested volume first hour life , neonatal exposure drug investigator 's study expect minimal . There publish report adverse effect misoprostol breast-feeding infant mother take misoprostol Misoprostol classify FDA Pregnancy Category X drug . This label relate possible association congenital anomaly use first trimester , well abortifacient property . In investigator 's study , patient longer pregnant participant receives drug . The use misoprostol enhance uterine activity postpartum off-label method , one gain wide acceptance , considerable experience . [ 8-10 , 12-19 ] The drug cause nausea , headache , dyspepsia , vomit , constipation diarrhea multiple dos . These side effect usually mild moderate generally subside within week . Serious side effect single dose quite rare . In one study 327 woman receive 600 µg rectally ( dose investigator propose use ) , common side effect transient shivering ( 26 % ) pyrexia ( 15 % ) . Both mild short-lived . [ 16 ] Benefits Risks Study Subjects There certain medical benefit subject participate study . It possible participant benefit reduce postpartum blood loss . Risks subject associate administration misoprostol . These include follow adverse event report subject receive misoprostol ulcer prophylaxis : diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea , flatulence , headache , dyspepsia , vomit , constipation . All occur few 5 % patient . Other report effect occur clinical trial misoprostol , cause-effect relation establish include fatigue , fever , chill , rash , alopecia , pallor , breast pain , abnormal taste , abnormal vision , conjunctivitis , deafness , tinnitus , earache , chest pain , edema , diaphoresis , hypotension , hypertension , arrhythmia , phlebitis , increase cardiac enzyme , syncope , myocardial infarction , thromboembolism , abnormal hepatobiliary function , gingivitis , reflux , dysphagia , gout , polyuria , dysuria , hematuria , urinary tract infection , anxiety , depression , thrombocytopenia . As drug , anaphylaxis possible . The investigator emphasize number publish study use single postpartum dose misoprostol 600-1000 µg include aggregate excess 1000 patient , serious side effect report . Side effect single dose misoprostol rare . Misoprostol cause nausea , headache , heartburn , vomit , flatulence , constipation diarrhea multiple dos . These side effect usually mild moderate generally go away within week . Mild shiver slight fever likely side effect medication . If side effect occur , probably disappear within hour . Oxytocin commonly cause vomit nausea . Oxytocin potential cause muscle contraction . In rare case , Oxytocin cause heart palpitation ( rapid heartbeat ) allergic reaction rash swell . It unknown whether Misoprostol and/or Oytocin excrete human milk . There unconfirmed relation Misoprostol and/or Oytocin cause digestive problem , diarrhea , abdominal cramp breast-fed newborn . Pariticipants advise discard breast mild first 24 hour possibly avoid occurrence . Study Procedure Informed consent obtain one investigator inform consent delegate . The subject assign randomly control ( oxytocin alone ) study ( oxytocin + misoprostol ) group , describe . The subject medical caretaker inform group . If labor eventuate vaginal delivery , subject receive standard dose intravenous oxytocin , begin within one minute delivery . Subjects study group incur post-hoc exclusion criterion ( episiotomy , major laceration , etc ) receive dose 600 µg misoprostol addition oxytocin . This administered form six 100 µg tablet insert approximately 2 cm anorectal canal obstetrician midwife perform delivery . The common method administer Misoprostol postpartum hemorrhage rectally local absorption . Since study direct toward prevention instead treatment , dosage 600mg low dosage 1000mg administer , standard practice , treat postpartum hemorrhage 500cc estimate blood loss . The patient 's vital sign record delivery accord standard protocol obstetric service . The Data Collection form fill delivery one investigator . The measurement postpartum hemoglobin hematocrit ( H &amp; H ) automatically order 06:00am patient deliver day prior , constitute measurement `` Postpartum Day 1 '' , minimum 6 hour delivery enough time H &amp; H level stabilize . Within 36 hour delivery , additional information collect patient 's record , include postpartum hemogram information symptom sign related misoprostol . Confidentiality After subject give informed consent , assign Study Number . This number use study data collection form sole patient identifier , i.e. , form contain subject 's name hospital number . A single hard copy list subject ' Study Numbers medical record number keep locked cabinet Principal Investigator 's sponsor 's office ( Dr. Fuks ) . This list destroy study accept publication . Only Dr. Fuks access list . Costs The cost 600 µg dose misproostol $ 4.80 . There charge patient . The drug pay research fund Department Obstetrics Gynecology Queens Hospital Center . Data Collection Data collection include follow element : Before Delivery - Age - Ethnicity/Race - Gestational age ( week ) - Number previous delivery - Number Fetus - Body-Mass Index ( BMI ) - Amniotic Fluid Index ( AFI ) - Cephalic presentation - Fetal Heart Rate ( FHR ) - Reported fetal Anomaly - Preeclampsia - Trial Labor Cesarean ( TOLAC ) After Delivery - Caesarean section ( delivery ) - Epidural - Oxytocin labor ( yes , number hour delivery - Other medication use labor - Episiotomy - Duration stage 1 , 2 , 3 - Degree place laceration - Estimated Blood Loss ( EBL ) - Transfusion - Placental Abruption - Birth weight Results - include Follow-up Data - Hemoglobin Hematocrit ( H &amp; H ) admission post- partum day # 1 - Reported Side effect patient - Post partum temperature - Reports shiver - Diagnosis chorioamnionitis Post- partum day # 1- data collection Postpartum Day 1 delineate first 12:01am clock time time delivery . Post-partum measurement , postpartum hemoglobin hematocrit ( H &amp; H ) , take automatically 06:00am delivery occur midnight ( least 6 hour prior ) .</detailed_description>
