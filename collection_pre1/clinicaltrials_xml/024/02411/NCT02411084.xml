	<brief_summary>The objective study determine efficacy safety BEGEDINA® subject steroid resistant acute graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) . GvHD rare complex immunological disease occur recipient allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCTs ) affect principally skin , liver gastrointestinal ( GI ) tissue . The disease life threatening may acute chronic first choice treatment patient acute GvHD ( Grade II high ) immunosuppressive corticosteroid hormone methylprednisolone . However , GvHD patient may resistant treatment lead disease progression high rate morbidity mortality , primarily infection and/or multi-organ failure . There currently satisfactory therapy . BEGEDINA® therapeutic monoclonal antibody recognise bind CD26 CD4+ T lymphocytes . BEGEDINA® reduce activity CD26 cell inhibit immune response lead improvement patient show steroid resistance . This study therefore aim demonstrate BEGEDINA® safe effective treatment steroid-resistant GvHD patient treatment currently available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study BEGEDINA® v `` Conventional Treatment '' Treating Steroid-Resistant Acute GvHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , phase II/III , randomize clinical study compare efficacy safety BEGEDINA® ( Begelomab ) versus `` conventional treatment '' treat steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) . Despite prophylactic treatment , GvHD still develop 30 % allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient . GvHD life-threatening complex immunological disease may acute chronic . Acute GvHD affect mainly skin , liver gastrointestinal ( GI ) tissue long-term survival directly relate severity skin , liver gut involvement . First line treatment patient acute GvHD ( Grade II high ) immunosuppressive corticosteroid methylprednisolone . Although effective 50 % patient , durable response observe third patient also confers risk severe infection . Steroid-resistant acute GvHD associate high rate morbidity mortality , primarily infection and/or multi-organ failure . Despite , authorized treatment non-responders GvHD remain largely untreatable disease limit survival thus great unmet therapeutic need . BEGEDINA® ( Begelomab ) murine immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) 2b monoclonal antibody CD26 ( dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ; DPP4 ) produce biotechnological mean new potential therapeutic approach . BEGEDINA® show bind CD26 present subset CD4+ T helper lymphocytes lead down-regulation CD26 signal inhibition immune response thus therapeutic improvement . BEGEDINA investigate two complete clinical study : pilot study dose-finding study far show promise efficacy , safety tolerability . The primary objective study therefore determine efficacy BEGEDINA® versus conventional therapy steroid-resistant acute GvHD . To satisfy objective , two co primary hypothesis test . The first overall response rate consist Complete Responders Partial Responders ( CR+PR ) Study Day 28 high BEGEDINA® treat subject . The second incidence transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) 6 month reduce subject treat BEGEDINA® versus treat conventional therapy . Additional secondary efficacy endpoint also assess measure effectiveness . In addition , pharmacokinetics assessment perform . Adverse event ( AEs ) cod use MedDRA frequency , causality intensity AEs compare conventional therapy . Further safety analysis also include laboratory finding , vital sign , immunogenicity assessment . Finally , exploratory analysis also perform . This prospective , multicenter , randomize , open-label , phase II/III clinical study subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive BEGEDINA® treatment best conventional treatment available territory second line therapy currently approve . It plan enroll 184 male female adult subject upper age limit 65 year steroid-resistant acute GvHD . BEGEDINA® administer dose 2.7 mg/m2/day 5 consecutive day Study Day 1 Study Day 5 , Study Days 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 24 , 28 . Thus , expect duration subject approximately 12 month . The final statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) finalize prior database lock . Baseline characteristic subject sample describe use summary statistic . All statistical test conduct 2-sided significance level 5 % unless specifically specify . Multiple Imputation method use primary method accounting miss data .</detailed_description>
