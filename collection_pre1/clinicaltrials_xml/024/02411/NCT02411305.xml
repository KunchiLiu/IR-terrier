	<brief_summary>Few formal mechanism collect , analyze , report data quality palliative care exist . Such infrastructure need understand current clinical practice , inform quality improvement project , research link adherence specific quality measure improve patient-centered outcome . This infrastructure , proven feasible , become integrated usual palliative care delivery across PCRC . Then , palliative care conduct type collaborative quality improvement activity , base data collect point care , medical discipline like general surgery cardiology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthcare process measure , evaluate , characterize use healthcare quality measure . Healthcare quality measure tool quantify consistency care delivery within population eligible process . Containing numerator ( successful delivery care process ) denominator ( eligible patient care process ) , quality measure produce frequency adherence rate care process perform . Adherence rate compare evaluate quality care across clinician , organization , collaboration compare data , establish benchmark , spur quality improvement project . In palliative care , example , usually consider best practice prescribe opioids moderate/severe pain . Imagine palliative care program 's calculated adherence rate reveals clinicians prescribe opioids moderate-to-severe pain 50 % time . Armed information , program develop direct quality improvement project intention improve performance towards ideal goal ( e.g . 75 % ) . Further , provide feedback clinician real-time regard perform quality measure interest . In example , clinician may receive electronic alert remind prescribe opioid direct accepted best practice . This real-time approach , combine system promote culture data collection , share , benchmarking , reporting , effective method improve healthcare quality . Lastly , focus proposal , build test infrastructure perform real-time quality monitoring healthcare measure Palliative Care Research Cooperative group ( PCRC ) . The investigator previously identify three major component need effective usable quality-monitoring infrastructure . Together , three component answer `` '' , `` '' , `` '' question must address within quality assessment improvement system . First , ability perform collaborative integrate data collection across several site . Successful multi-site data collection require centrally govern set data collection process , guide data dictionary . A data dictionary set agreed-upon data element , answer choice , rule , branch logic . The data dictionary informs development data collection platform use clinician . Together , data dictionary software use clinician guide `` '' data collect , ensure intend collaborative analysis perform data set create . Second , process data collection - `` '' characteristic within system . Data collect , transmit record use data collection platform , transmission process , registry , respectively . The data collection platform interface real-time data capture record . This involve paper-based electronic form use patient , caregiver , clinician reporter . Data transmit registry , either electronic manual mean . Lastly , data collect securely store prospective registry , quality report generate research analysis complete . These step recommend standard development health information technology Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) . Third , component infrastructure answer question , `` ? '' Several report highlight need translate raw data quality monitoring effort continuous feedback quality clinician end-users motivate delivery best practice . This allow change clinician performance usual clinical care delivery , thus meet Institute Medicine 's aim rapid learn healthcare system . Generally , feedback provide system-generated report target specific end-users ( e.g . clinician , administrator ) deliver pre-specified time period ( e.g . weekly , quarterly ) . At Duke University , investigator recently build information technology infrastructure need prospective quality measure adherence outcomes monitor palliative care . This system develop deploy Carolinas Consortium Palliative Care , four-site collaboration Duke University three community palliative care organization . Recently , Consortium expand include organization outside Carolinas ; eleven sit comprise Global Palliative Care Quality Alliance ( GPCQA ) . The rapid expansion qdact user subsequent data collect support several research-level analysis publish literature . In use qdact.pc , clinicians record data process care patient-reported outcome personal iPadsÂ® face-to-face clinical encounter patient . During patient interview , clinician record patient-reported area distress , clinical management decision , patient-reported outcome use validated instrument . These instrument include common field , include Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ( ESAS ) , Palliative Performance Scale , FACT-G. Longitudinal change scale capture repeat use qdact.pc subsequent encounter . Further , qdact.pc calculates length stay admission discharge date , change symptom severity calculate difference two date , readmission rate analyze whether patient registry previously admit . Then , care process outcomes link use data .</detailed_description>
