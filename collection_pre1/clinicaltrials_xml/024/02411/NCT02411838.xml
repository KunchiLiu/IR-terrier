	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize adipokine ( soluble molecule produce adipose tissue ) level alter MS compare control subject . Additionally , investigator hypothesize calorie restriction ( CR ) improve clinical recovery MS relapse , ameliorate adipokine metabolic-inflammatory profile MS , enhance immune-regulatory mechanism . This pilot study determine effect CR MS patient acute MS relapse ( Acute CR phase ) 6 month afterwards ( Chronic CR phase ) . Calorie restriction achieve follow regimen alternate day fast . The investigator evaluate clinical outcome blood biomarkers different time point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study determine effect CR blood biomarkers ( include serum level adipokines , cytokine , cortisol T reg number ) compare standard therapy MS patient recovery relapse . Sixteen MS patient ( body mass index-BMI ≥ 23 ) attack enrol randomize either : 1. steroid treatment ( 10 day ) standard therapy MS relapse ; 2 . CR plus steroid treatment ( 10 day ) . Calorie restriction achieve follow regimen alternate day fasting ( day fast subject allow eat two salad olive oil lemon juice vinegar ) . Briefly , subject fast day 1 ( first day steroid ) continue fast alternate day day 15 , another fasting day . After 15 day alternate day fasting , group offer enroll intermittent fast regimen 6 month ( salad allow fasting day ) ( chronic CR phase ) . Specifically , patient BMI &lt; 28 follow regimen fast two day per week patient BMI &gt; 28 follow regimen fast three day per week . Blood sample obtain analyzed specify point study routine testing ( CBC CMP ) immune/inflammatory analysis . Specifically , blood sample obtain baseline ( day 1 , start steroid ) 15 day alternate fast . For patient enrol chronic CR study six month blood sample also obtain month 3 6 . MS subject evaluate day 15 initiation steroid . Those subject participate chronic CR study also donate blood month 3 6 . If patient take immunomodulatory medication MS , continue entire trial . They follow assess study nutritionist experience human CR . Patients see nutritionist baseline , day 15 first portion study . At baseline visit instruct fast day 1 every day . During fasting day , patient allow eat salad 2 Table spoon olive oil canola oil plus vinegar lemon juice twice/day . The goal eat le 500 calorie fast day . The nutritionist also educate patient consume nutritionally adequate diet non-fasting day avoid `` overeating '' . Patients keep daily food diary entering chronic CR phase return center meet nutritionist month 3 6 ( telephone contact ) . At baseline visit , patient sign inform consent , investigator collect medical history , perform physical examination , calculate BMI ( define weight Kg / height m2 ) waist circumference ( index visceral fat accumulation ) perform neurological assessment , include EDSS standard neurologic exam use MS trial assign score 0 ( deficit ) 10 ( dead MS ) , multiple sclerosis functional composite ( MSFC ) , quantitative test upper low limb function cognition supplement additional cognitive test call Symbol Digit Modality Test ( SDMT ) MS quality life inventory ( MSQLI ) . Blood collect routine testing ( CBC , CMP ) adipokine/cytokine , cortisol , T reg cell analyse perform investigator ' laboratory . All assessment sample collection repeat day 15 month 3 6 patient participate chronic CR phase . Neurologic exams also perform day 2 , 3 steroid treatment day 15 . Additional assessment perform month 1 , 3 6 patient enter chronic CR phase . These assessment include visit : physical evaluation neurological assessment ( neurologic exam / EDSS , MSFC ) MSQLI , BMI waist circumference reflect change body weight due CR . Blood acquire day 1 , day 15 month 3 6 patient CR chronic phase . This 15 ml blood collect morning follow overnight fast . CBC , CMP total cortisol test perform Barnes Jewish Hospital chemistry laboratory . The rest blood process within one hour investigator ' laboratory . Serum aliquoted store -80 ⁰C future analysis ( adiponectin , leptin , resistin , tumor necrosis factor-alpha IL-6 ELISA ) . The investigator also investigate number function peripheral T reg cell . T reg number evaluate flow cytometry stain fresh blood specific marker identify T regs ( CD4+ cell express high level CD25 ) Foxp3 . T reg function evaluate vitro described . Briefly , CD4+CD25high CD4+CD25- cell population isolate peripheral blood co-cultured different ratio presence anti cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 antibody stimulate CD4+CD25- cell proliferation . CD4+CD25- proliferation inhibit differentially base proportion T reg cell culture . Proliferation CD4+CD25- cell cytokine level culture supernatant reflect T reg suppressive capacity . A stool sample also collect baseline , day 15 , month 3 6 . These sample analyze study effect CR gut microbiota .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must diagnose relapse MS . Participants must 18 60 year old . Participants need experience relapse identify neurologist . Participants must body mass index ( BMI ) 23 high . Participants must ongoing disease system . History chronic disease process ( exclude MS ) could interfere interpretation result . Use insulin pump insulin injection diabetes . Use drug like Warfarin Coumadin need monitor intake vegetable contain high level vitamin K. Patients require physician follow special diet food restriction ( diabetic , gastric bypass , soft/pureed food , etc . ) Alcoholism , psychiatric problem , life situation would interfere study participation compliance .</criteria>
