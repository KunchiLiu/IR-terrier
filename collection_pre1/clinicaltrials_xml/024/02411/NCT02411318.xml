	<brief_title>Influence Lifestyle Factors Neutrophil Migration Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate external factor implicate immunity exercise , caffeine ingestion ethanol consumption influence neutrophil migration . Neutrophils prominent immune cell human blood involve complex equilibrium immune protection autoimmune damage . Their recruitment inflammatory wound site control sense direct migration concentration gradient attractant molecule , process call chemotaxis . Immune cell also implicate many disease include cancer . The ability measure amplitude response time specific patient , variation response patient engage certain activity consume certain substance improve understand certain lifestyle factor impact immune response . Traditional assay require large volume blood long purification process , may affect neutrophil function strictly limit number draw possible single patient . The novel microfluidic assay propose limit drawback capability purify neutrophil 3 ÂµL drop blood le 5 minute measure chemotaxis gradient chemokines . Critically , propose study begin fill gap current understand immune response previous study focus single endpoint likely miss early event response external stimulus . Understanding temporal response may implications development new treatment well improvement diagnosis improper immune response . The KOALA ( Kit On A Lid Assay ) approach develop Professor Dave Beebe 's lab validate mouse model human asthmatic patient . In collaboration Dr. Anna Huttenlocher , show , contrast traditional neutrophil purification , KOALA perform small volume blood , much quick purification time . Due unique quality , KOALA allow repeat evaluation neutrophil adhesion chemotaxis property , thus make attractive method study dynamic neutrophil change may occur result external factor . Using traditional macrobiology tool , researcher identify several factor may play important role reduce neutrophil responsiveness migration ability . Lifestyle diet factor , amongst others , show impact neutrophil count , migration biochemical function . For example , sleep deprivation link high neutrophil count , despite know immuno-depressive effect . Physical exercise result increase neutrophil count increase neutrophil degranulation . Dietary factor , caffeine ethanol show impact immune function . To build research , investigator intend probe role lifestyle factor neutrophil migration much short time scale previously study . The investigator propose examine effect exercise , ethanol ingestion caffeine consumption neutrophil behavior . Whole blood obtain subject finger stick use KOALA isolate neutrophil . Neutrophil function assess measure absolute migration speed , chemotactic index chemotaxis velocity ( directional velocity toward formation gradient chemoattractant ) . The primary outcome study determine whether exercise , caffeine consumption ethanol ingestion affect neutrophil chemotactic velocity . The secondary outcome determine whether exercise , caffeine consumption ethanol ingestion affect absolute speed chemotactic index neutrophil .</detailed_description>
