	<brief_summary>Rationale : During last decade , research possible therapy exist obesity developmental factor cause obesity explosively increase . Recently renew interest arouse tissue play possible role development therapy obesity : brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) . To define relation BAT thyroid hormone , investigator set follow research protocol . In protocol BAT activity determine subject underwent thyroidectomy well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma . Objective : To study effect thyroid hormone thyroid-stimulating hormone brown adipose tissue activity . Study design : Determine BAT activity thyroidectomy well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma patient . Study population : Patients underwent thyroidectomy well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma , male female , age 18-65 year . Intervention : FDG-PET-CT-imaging ( [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography ) BAT activity perform cold stimulation twice . For patient clinically withdraw thyroid hormone suppletion , first occasion hypothyroid state within 4-6 week thyroidectomy second measurement take place euthyroid state 4 month start thyroid hormone treatment . For patient receive recombinant-thyroid-stimulating-hormone injection , first occasion shortly injection state high thyroid-stimulating hormone level . The second measurement euthyroid state 4 month injection . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main endpoint study effect thyroid hormone thyroid-stimulating hormone BAT activity kBq ( kilobecquerel ) SUV ( standard uptake value ) . Secondary endpoint effect thyroid hormone thyroid-stimulating hormone energy metabolism , body core temperature , skin surface temperature skin perfusion . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The absorbed radiation dose FDG PET-CT scan administration 74 MBq ( megabecquerel ) 18F-FDG 2.8 mSv ( miliSievert ) .</brief_summary>
