	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics Study YYB101 Advanced Solid Tumors Patients Who Are Refractory Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics YYB101 , patient refractory standard therapy enrol study . In dose-escalation cohort , subject enrol sequentially four dose cohort receive single dose YYB101 ( 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 5 mg/kg ; 3 6 subject per dose cohort ) enter 4-week treatment-free period evaluate safety pharmacokinetics . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe 4-week period , YYB101 administration resume dose level every 2 week disease progression unacceptable toxicity development . After completion dose-escalation cohort , additional subject enrol dose-expansion cohort maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) exploration safety , tolerability , efficacy pharmacodynamics .</detailed_description>
