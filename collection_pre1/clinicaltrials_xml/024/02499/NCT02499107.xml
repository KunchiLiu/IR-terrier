	<detailed_description>The prevalence childhood obesity overweight become major health concern worldwide . Prevention overweight obesity child high priority high risk become obese adult obesity predictive development coronary heart disease , hypertension diabetes . Thus , need food-based solution increase satiety subsequently reduce energy intake . Over past 40 year , consumption potato decrease 41 % may consequence movement aim decrease serve size , outright ban , potato food cafeterias quick service restaurant French fry due observational study show link increase risk obesity . Alternate energy dense starch rice pasta increase consumption result meal accompaniment discernible decrease upward trajectory number overweight obese individual . These recent trend may consequence individual ignore vital information substantial nutrient content well overall balance low energy density nutrient density ratio potato addition beneficial component . Compounding , research also indicate GI potato high relative starch , spite recent evidence suggest high variability measurement little consideration take preparation method potato ( potato chip vs. bake potato , example ) . Additionally , potato commonly consume food turn often significantly low GI meal compare consumption potato alone . For example , Estima potato ingest 62 g cheddar cheese reduce GI 93 39 mash potato serve oil , chicken breast salad ( represent meal ) reduce GI potato 108 54 . The GI base consumption fix amount available carbohydrate , may representative glycaemic effect amount carbohydrate usually consume serve food within meal , case potato . We extensive experience conduct experimental study especially child . Previously laboratory , investigate publish numerous study focus assess food intake ( FI ) regulation appetite child age 9 13 year . Thus , purpose current study determine effect commonly consume carbohydrate source potato , pasta rice along fixed portion meat blood glucose , satiety insulin level among healthy body weight child ( age 11 13 year ) 2 hour period .</detailed_description>
