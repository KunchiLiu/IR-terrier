	<detailed_description>Introduction High intensity exercise lead muscle damage , result muscle soreness , swell reduction muscle strength ( Proske &amp; Allen , 2005 ) . If recovery sufficient efficient increase risk injury decrease ability athlete perform repetitive exercise maintain overall performance . Therefore , use recovery strategy practice session important factor training process , allow athlete make training regime perform . There variety recovery aid use athlete , : use compression garment , massage , cold water immersion , sauna etc . Additional recovery strategy currently grow popularity application vibration ( Rhea et al . 2009 ; Broadbent et al . 2010 ) . It suggest application vibration could increase blood flow muscle , increase muscle temperature , increase metabolite removal rate accelerate muscle tissue remodel . All process could reduce delay onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) accelerate muscle recovery ( Rhea et al . 2009 ; Broadbent et al . 2010 ; Lau et al . 2011 ) . Although DOMS one symptoms muscle damage , n't necessarily reflect provide indication ability muscle produce strength . That , possible athlete feel well ( associate pain ) ability produce force still low compare baseline measurement . The ability produce force objective important measure quantify recovery status athlete intense exertion ( Warren et al . 1999 ) . The efficacy vibration therapy promote recovery test small number study equivocal result . For example , Barnes et al . ( 2012 ) test 8 healthy male complete 300 eccentric contraction quadriceps one leg isokinetic dynamometer . Immediately exercise 12 24 hour post-exercise , subject underwent either vibration therapy control treatment - use recovery technique . The vibration therapy include 5 set 1min vibration 26 Hz , 6 mm peak-to-peak displacement . After two week initial trial , subject complete second trial use contralateral leg treatment . The study 's result reveal use vibration therapy reduce muscle peak force average peak force 24 hour eccentric exercise compare control group . Another study test use vibration therapy muscle recovery strength . This study find recovery elbow flexor peak isometric torque unaffected vibration untrained participant ( Lau et al . 2010 ) . This support Fuller et al . ( 2014 ) , find use vibration therapy n't additional contribution recovery intense exercise compare stretching massage . The evidence regard benefit vibration therapy recovery aid limit . From paucity study area suggest additional benefit use vibration therapy . Yet , use different vibration technique currently quite popular among athlete several study perform today do non-athlete population . Furthermore , study n't test functional variable ability produce power perform repeated performance . Performing repeat exercise similar situation occasionally occur ball game . Therefore , propose study examine use vibration therapy recovery tool . The efficacy technique measure use functional field test . Study purpose The purpose propose study examine effect vibration therapy recovery tool ability perform repeat exertion . Method The study procedure receive ethic approval Helsinki board Hillel Yaffe Medical Center , Hadera , Israel . The propose study sample include 30 novice athlete ( 18-35 yr . ) , recruit participate study . Inclusion criterion group : ( ) participation physical activity three hour per week presently previous year , ( b ) healthy individual . Exclusion criterion group : ( ) chronic disease ( hypertension , diabetes , etc . ) ( b ) chronic/frequent use medication , ( c ) orthopedic neurologic injury disorder . Exclusion criterion study : development associate muscle skeletal pain . Study protocol The participant arrive Ribstein Center Sports Medicine Research Wingate Institute two different occasion , 7 day apart . First visit - gradual stress test perform exhaustion . Immediately end test ten minute recovery period take place , either recovery method use ( passive active vibration technique ) . Immediately follow recovery period participant perform two functional test examine muscle power endurance . The 1st test countermovement jump ( 3 jump perform 15sec rest ) . The 2nd test 30sec jump test ( continuous jump ) . Two minute rest period take test . The test perform use Optojump Next measuring system ( Optojump , Microgate , Italy ) . The recovery method : 1 . Active passive : 3min slow walking ( 4 km/h ) , 2min standing , 5min slow walking ( 4 km/h ) . 2 . Vibration therapy : 3min slow walking ( 4 km/h ) , 2min standing , 5min vibration therapy special vibration machine design low extremity . At end exercise peripheral blood sample take finger order measure blood lactate level . Additional five sample take 2min interval end recovery period ( total 10min ) . Technical information vibration machine- vibration frequency 1-10 hertz , amplitude : 30mm . Second visit - gradual stress test perform exhaustion . Immediately end test ten minute recovery period take place , recovery method use ( passive active vibration technique ) . Afterwards two functional test perform . ** The order recovery method assign randomly participant . First visit protocol : 1 . Explanation consent form sign 2 . Filling medical questionnaire 3 . Medical interview examination sport 's physician 4 . Anthropometric measure : height , weight , percentage body fat 5 . Stress test - include ECG blood pressure monitor 6 . Recovery - 10min - use different recovery mode 7 . Countermovement jump test 30sec jump test Second visit protocol : ( 7 day apart ) 1 . Stress test 2 . Recovery - 10min - use recovery mode use first visit 3 . Countermovement jump test 30sec jump test Measures take study : 1 . Lactate level 2 . Heart rate ( monitor continuously exercise recovery period ) 3 . Rate perceive exertion - subjective evaluation difficulty level exercise ( exercise , end jump ' test ) 4 . Jumps ' height test , consistency fatigue index Statistical analysis Paired t-tests perform order evaluate effect recovery mode muscle fatigue index muscle performance measure ( power , jump height , etc . )</detailed_description>
