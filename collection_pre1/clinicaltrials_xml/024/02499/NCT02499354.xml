	<brief_title>Pilot Study : Randomized , Placebo-controlled Comparator Trial IV v Oral Iron Treatment RLS With IDA . ( IVOR-IDA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) ( also know Willis Ekbom Disease ) occur 1/3rd patient iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) . Treatment correct IDA expect also effective reduce eliminate RLS IDA . Two accept treatment IDA ( oral ferrous sulfate , intravenous ferumoxytol ) compare efficacy speed response treatment RLS occur IDA ( RLS-IDA ) . In study 70 RLS-IDA patient randomly assign 35 oral IV iron treatment use double-blind procedure . Primary outcome determine 6 week treatment follow-up 12 month treatment . Non-responders 6 week treatment may , qualify , open-label IV iron treatment follow evaluation use first set IV iron treatment . Both oral IV iron consider standard treatment IDA . These treatment also reduce RLS symptom . The treatment dose accept treatment RLS also appropriate treatment RLS-IDA . Choosing dos equivalent treatment RLS without IDA allow comparison literature . The investigator therefore use oral iron ferrous sulfate 325mg take twice day match dose use study oral iron treatment RLS without anemia . For IV iron investigator use ferumoxytol , provide sponsor , two dos 510 mg space 2 7 day apart . This FDA approve dose treatment IDA end stage renal disease . The study randomize , comparative open label study evaluate effect size time course treatment response RLS-IDA 6 week 46-week follow-up extension . Two medication placebo use , describe , equal random assignment group .</detailed_description>
