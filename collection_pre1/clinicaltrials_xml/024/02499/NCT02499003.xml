	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate overall response rate Obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) combination Pixantrone patient relapse aggressive B-cell lymphoma . 70 patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , follicular lymphoma grade IIIB transform indolent lymphoma receive 6 cycle describe combination regimen . Follow visit schedule 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GOAL : GA101 Plus Pixantrone Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient multiple relapse aggressive lymphoma refractory lymphoma life expectancy short . Without potent treatment option remain life span measure week month . Recently , increase number report show either single agent use incorporation potentially potent agent new approach aim inhibition lymphoma specific pathway may help overcome current stagnation improvement first second line therapy . Surprisingly , little effort undertaken identify optimal standard dose backbone regimen base currently available novel drug , ideally would combine activity reasonable safety tolerability allow addition target drug future . Therefore trial aim test prospectively one potential combination evaluate potency patient suitable intensive treatment . Obinutuzumab anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody show clinical efficacy even patient fail Rituximab pre-treatment therefore attractive combination partner within chemo-immunotherapy regimen . Pixantrone belong potent class cytostatic drug treatment lymphoma . Given proven efficacy drug relapse aggressive lymphoma well side effect profile drug , combination treatment seem sufficiently safe promise significant efficacy . This multicenter , prospective , open-label , non-randomized trial evaluate overall response rate Obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) combination Pixantrone patient relapse aggressive B-cell lymphoma . The trial consist 28-days screening period , treatment-period 6 cycle combination regiment , include interim stag prior cycle 4 end treatment visit 4-6 week last study-medication application . The response treatment measure result computer tomography ( CT ) cycle 6 individual end treatment . Structured follow visit schedule 2 year , afterwards patient follow survival progression via simplify survey end trial .</detailed_description>
