	<brief_summary>Smokeless tobacco user unable unwilling quit tobacco use may expose potent oral esophageal carcinogen NNN tobacco , also via endogenous synthesis nornicotine . The propose study lead understand endogenous formation NNN nornicotine human , also investigate effect reduction nornicotine content smokeless tobacco extent endogenous NNN formation . The knowledge gain study lead development recommendation regulation , potentially elimination , nornicotine smokeless tobacco product order minimize exposure NNN user product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The tobacco alkaloid nornicotine precursor N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) , potent tobacco-specific carcinogen . NNN believe play important role induction esophageal oral cavity cancer tobacco user . Nornicotine contribute NNN exposure tobacco user two way . In addition precursor NNN formation tobacco , may also nitrosated endogenously . Endogenous nitrosation nornicotine present tobacco product occur oral cavity , stomach , elsewhere body tobacco user . This particularly relevant use smokeless tobacco product - form tobacco keep oral cavity prolong period time , create favorable condition nornicotine nitrosation . Given high carcinogenic potency NNN association smokeless tobacco use oral esophageal cancer , regulation nornicotine content smokeless tobacco product urgently need . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) authority regulate harmful potentially harmful tobacco constituent Family Smoking Prevention Tobacco Control Act . The information extent endogenous nitrosation nornicotine function content smokeless product crucial adequate regulation tobacco constituent FDA . Aims proposal : ( 1 ) To determine variation nornicotine content smokeless product currently market U.S . There information nornicotine content individual smokeless brand , extent variation among currently market U.S. product unknown . Aim 1 address important gap also provide critical information Aim 2 proposal . ( 2 ) To investigate endogenous formation NNN smokeless tobacco user . Smokeless tobacco user randomize tobacco-free herbal snuff contain various amount stable isotope-labeled nornicotine add . Isotope-labeled urinary total NNN - biomarker exposure NNN - measure subject use liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry . This methodology allow specific identification urinary total NNN endogenous nitrosation nornicotine , versus result exposure NNN tobacco product . The effect nornicotine reduction extent endogenous NNN formation study gradually decrease amount isotope-labeled nornicotine add study snuff . The result study provide extremely important new information endogenous formation carcinogenic nitrosamine NNN upon exposure nornicotine tobacco use . An understanding process absolutely necessary adequate regulation nornicotine tobacco product purpose minimize public harm .</detailed_description>
