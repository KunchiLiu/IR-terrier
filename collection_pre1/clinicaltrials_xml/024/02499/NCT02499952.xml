	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Subjects With Incurable Platinum-Refractory Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Eligible subject must receive initial cisplatin-based combination therapy , bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin ( BEP ) , cisplatin-etoposide ( EP ) , etoposide-ifosfamide-cisplatin ( VIP ) , similar regimen AND demonstrated progression follow administration least one 'salvage ' regimen advance germ cell neoplasm , high dose chemotherapy , paclitaxel-ifosfamide-cisplatin ( TIP ) , vinblastine-ifosfamide-cisplatin ( VeIP ) . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 week progression toxicity . Treatment continue 52 week absence prohibitive toxicity disease progression . The follow screening labs demonstrate adequate organ function must perform within 10 day treatment initiation : Hematological : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL - Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL - Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion hematopoietin ( EPO ) dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR - Measured calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN - Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) also use place creatinine creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR - Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN - AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis - Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation : - International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant</detailed_description>

ECOG Performance Status 0 1 within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy . Subjects must histological serological proof metastatic germ cell neoplasm ( gonadal extragonadal primary ) disease amenable cure either surgery chemotherapy . Subjects seminoma nonseminoma eligible , woman ovarian GCTs . Subjects must evidence recurrent metastatic carcinoma one following : appearance metastatic disease chest xray CT scan , appearance rise tumor marker : AFP betaHCG . NOTE : If rise tumor marker evidence progressive disease , least 2 consecutive rise value least one week apart need . Subjects evidence disease rise tumor marker AFP betaHCG provide alternate cause increase serum level marker present , cross reaction luteinizing hormone ( LH ) ( test need testosterone suppression LH ) , hepatitis , use marijuana , second primary tumor , etc . Subjects must receive initial cisplatin base combination therapy , bleomycinetoposidecisplatin ( BEP ) , cisplatinetoposide ( EP ) , etoposideifosfamidecisplatin ( VIP ) , similar regimen AND demonstrated progression follow administration least one 'salvage ' regimen advance germ cell neoplasm , high dose chemotherapy , paclitaxelifosfamidecisplatin ( TIP ) , vinblastineifosfamidecisplatin ( VeIP ) . `` Failure '' prior therapy define : &gt; 25 % increase product perpendicular diameter measurable tumor mass prior therapy amenable surgical resection ; presence new tumor amenable surgical resection ; increase AFP betahCG ( two separate determination least one week apart require rise tumor marker evidence failure ) . NOTE : Subjects clinically grow `` teratoma '' ( normal decline tumor marker radiographic clinical progression ) consider surgery . Subjects eligible first line platinum base chemotherapy disease relapse Primary Mediastinal Non Seminomatous Germ Cell tumor ( PMNSGCT ) late relapse ( &gt; 2 year ) amenable surgical resection . Subjects must willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g. , inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement sponsor investigator Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Measurable disease accord RECIST v1.1 obtain image within 28 day prior registration . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event ( AE ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . NOTE 1 : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . NOTE 2 : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e , . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Presence interstitial lung disease history pneumonitis require treatment corticosteroid . Has active infection require systemic therapy .
