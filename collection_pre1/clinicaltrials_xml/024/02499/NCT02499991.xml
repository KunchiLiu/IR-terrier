	<brief_summary>Research show plenitude intervention use enhance memory old adult ; however , evidence whether intervention enhance memory daily activity equivocal . The purpose pilot study test memory intervention potentially useful everyday life . Objectives pilot study : 1 ) examine feasibility intervention ( e.g. , ease use material provide ) ; 2 ) gain preliminary evidence intervention 's impact recall recent daily social event . Participants 20 cognitively healthy ( i.e . cognitively impaired ) old adult , 10 participant randomly assign either intervention control group , respectively . The study consist : ) pre-training session ; b ) seven day independent memory training ; c ) post-training session . The pre-training session involve test measure recall daily social event previous week . This follow seven day train recall daily social event . During seven day , intervention group perform daily memory task use self-instructional material give researcher , whereas control group use strategy remember social event involve week . The post-training session occur seven day involve test pre-training session measure recall social event previous week . The hypothesis : ) recall social event higher post-training test pre-training test ; b ) recall well intervention group control group . The ease use memory recall material provide intervention group assess interview .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memory Intervention Older Adults - ( Social )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method Participants The sample consist 20 cognitively healthy old adult ( age 55 old ) recruit Centre Aging participant database . The participant database approve Health REB ( REB # HS14652 ) . Individuals participant database give consent contact researcher willingness participate specific research project . Names individual provide researcher Centre Aging upon submission REB approval research protocol . Materials Questionnaires Pre-training Questionnaire - demographic . The questionnaire consist general question participant . Items include gender , age , experience memory training . Pre-training memory recall test . The questionnaire ask participant describe social event previous week . This questionnaire give pre-training session . Post-training memory recall test . The questionnaire ask participant describe social event previous week . This questionnaire give post-training session . Post-training questionnaire . The questionnaire ask participant thought regard format usefulness instruction material . For example , participant ask thought study help remember social event . Intervention group material Memory task - instruction . This document instruct participant intervention group use memory task daily social event . Memory task - form . Each day separate document ) diary social event ; b ) task review week 's social event . Memory task - form example . This example form fill help explain memory task do . Design This study involve experimental design , whereby participant randomly assign one two group , intervention group ( n=10 ) control group ( n=10 ) . The independent variable , therefore , presence absence daily memory record task social event . The dependent variable : ( ) change performance write recall test pre- post-training ; ( b ) difference group ( i.e. , Control vs. intervention group ) performance memory social event . Information useful intervention material use qualitative way help improve intervention . Procedure The study consist : ) pre-training session ; b ) seven day independent memory training ( intervention group ) usual way remember social event ( control group ) ; c ) post-training session . The pre-training session involve test measure recall social event previous week . This follow seven day train recall daily social event . The post-training session occur seven day involve test pre-training session measure recall social event previous week . Pre-training session . There separate pre-training session individual participant principal investigator either University Manitoba ( Bannatyne campus Fort Garry campus ) , participant prefers , home . During pre-training session , principal investigator provide inform consent form participant . The principal investigator describe project , review consent form answer question . Once participant provide write consent , demographic questionnaire administer . A pre-training memory recall test also do ask participant list social event previous week . Seven day train week . Materials provide intervention group pre-training session . Materials include : ) instruction memory task ; b ) form day diaries task ; c ) example form fill . The control group receive material rely memory strategy remember social event 7 day . Post-training session . There separate post-training session individual participant principal investigator either University Manitoba ( Bannatyne campus Fort Garry campus ) participant ' home . A post-training memory recall test do ask participant list social event previous week ( i.e. , test use pre-training session ) . The post-training questionnaire also administer participant . Data Management Data enter computer . The computer file contain name address participant data identify unique participant ID . Consent form store locked filing cabinet Dr. Menec 's research space ( S112 Medical Services Bldg ) . Analyses A total score social event recall create . Scores calculate follow scheme : ) one point remember event ; b ) one point remember day event . Other score approach also consider ; example , assign high score detail person meet remember . SPSS use test hypothesis use two independent group t-tests . The use t-tests justify ) investigator compare score pre- post-session memory recall test ; b ) investigator appropriate sample size 20 ; c ) investigator two independent group . The usefulness memory intervention material examine qualitatively look response question participant ' comment .</detailed_description>
