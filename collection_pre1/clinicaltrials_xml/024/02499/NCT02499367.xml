	<brief_summary>This single center non-blinded randomized non-comparative phase II trial . The first stage trial consist five arm ( induction treatment follow nivolumab , 1 induction treatment nivolumab ) . For second stage , number arm reduce base result obtain first stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab After Induction Treatment Triple-negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient relatively high relapse rate upon relapse median overall survival less year . No targeted therapy currently available subgroup . Compared breast cancer subtypes , percentage tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) significantly high TNBC . Given durable response induce immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab advance solid cancer , immunotherapeutic approach , blockade PD-1 nivolumab may key treat TNBC . Moreover , since classical anticancer agent stimulate immune effector cell , investigator hypothesize short-term induction treatment radiation , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide cisplatin induces anticancer immune response result synergistic activity nivolumab .</detailed_description>
