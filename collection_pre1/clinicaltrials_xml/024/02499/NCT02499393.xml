	<detailed_description>First decade twenty first century era therapeutic hypothermia become widely use procedure manage neonate hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy . New 2010 neonatal resuscitation guideline state offering therapeutic hypothermia standard care manage neonate sustain perinatal hypoxic - ischemic insult present sign moderate and/or severe hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy . Despite evidence come several randomize control trial prove effectiveness , certain situation effect perceive insufficient modest best . For reason today 's research effort direct toward find new possibility enhance effect hypothermia . Some new modality : modification hypothermia protocol , hypothermia combine drug potential neuro-protective , finally stem cell therapy . List medications/substances potential neuro - protective property include : erythropoetin , melatonin , topiramate , morphine , xenon , magnesium sulfate . Given investigator previous experience group preterm neonates either exposed magnesium sulfate prenatally administer drug birth perinatal asphyxia , natural design trial would evaluate possibility increase effect therapeutic hypothermia combine modality administration magnesium sulfate . Before era inhale NO magnesium sulfate widely use management neonate persistent pulmonary hypertension neonate ( PPHN ) , level serum keep high range ( 3,5 - 5,5 mmol/L ) . Until several publish study evaluate effectiveness magnesium sulfate group asphyxiate neonate , include one randomize control trial . Results promise . However , study conduct era therapeutic hypothermia . Furthermore , irrespective potential benefit , safety use magnesium sulfate therapeutic hypothermia group term late preterm neonate study . It particularly important light result present Mittendorf et.al . They study effect prenatal aggressive treatment magnesium sulfate outcome neonate bear low birth weight show patient expose high dos magnesium high risk develop severe intracranial bleeding . Other known side effect high serum magnesium level : vasodilatation , hypotension , cardiac arrhythmia , coagulopathy , gastrointestinal disturbance . Magnesium sulfate attractive option neuroprotective drug also easy availability . Drug administer patient birth hospital neonate prepare transport center therapeutic hypothermia . Timing intervention important management neonate suffer perinatal asphyxia . Both , therapeutic hypothermia , well administration potentially neuroprotective drug start call `` therapeutic window '' . It initial potentially reversible phase hypoxic insult last 6 hour follow irreversible phase apoptosis destruction neuron . If long term follow show magnesium sulfate additive neuroprotective effect significant side effect group asphyxiate neonate treat therapeutic hypothermia relatively simple expensive intervention may introduce clinical practice .</detailed_description>
