	<brief_title>Study Assess MEDI4736 With Either AZD9150 AZD5069 Advanced Solid Tumors &amp; Relapsed Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head &amp; Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose-escalation Part A study involve patient advance solid malignancy refractory standard therapy standard care regimen currently exist . Approximately 30 evaluable patient per treatment arm ( A1 A2 ) enrol . A3 test viability alternate dose schedule AZD5069 , A4/A5 evaluate AZD9150/AZd5069 fix dose combination MEDI4736 tremelimumab solid tumor . may also safety run cohort enrol ( A6/A7 ) specific solid tumor type ( breast prostate cancer ) . Once maximum tolerated dos ( MTDs ) 2 agent ( AZD9150/AZD5069 ) combination MEDI4736 identify maximum dos 2 agent combination MEDI4736 reach , dose expansion Part B study would commence . It conduct patient recurrent and/or metastatic ( RM ) squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . Between 68 124 eligible patient enrol randomly assign 1 follow 6 treatment arm : - Treatment arm B1 : AZD9150 combination MEDI4736 patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody - Treatment arm B2 : AZD5069 combination MEDI4736 patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody - Treatment arm B3 : AZD9150 combination MEDI4736 patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody - Treatment arm B4 : AZD5069 combination MEDI4736 patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody - Treatment arm B5 : AZD9150 alone patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody - Treatment arm B6 : AZD5069 alone patient prior exposure anti-PD- ( L ) 1 antibody</detailed_description>
