	<detailed_description>Randomized , control , multicenter , performance , cost assessment economic evaluation clinical trial . An arm trial consist patient assign intervention group ( telehealth group : TG ) , arm consist patient randomize control group ( routine clinical practice : RCP ) . For economic evaluation , perspective health system use . Therefore direct cost consider . In TG arm also intervention cost consider . Patient selection : Responsible researcher hospital center coordinate patient selection process . The researcher identify candidate patient screen hospital medical record . After first screening , patient contact invited participate study . In personal interview , researcher explains study patient deliver information sheet , verify patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , obtains inform consent proceeds patient randomization . To avoid bias exclusion , researcher hold record patient exclusion cause . Every hospital center include average 60 patient ( 30 arm ) . The inclusion patient competitive ; center include patient study reach final sample size 120 patient per arm . Randomization : To avoid selection bias , patient assign group randomize . To ensure number subject arm , restrictive block randomization perform . Randomization perform use random number generation computer block size 10 unit . Home Telehealth program : Vital sign device use : spirometer , pulse oximeter capacity heart rate monitor , blood pressure , Visionox® ( device capable measure respiratory rate , compliance hour oxygen , flow pattern oxygen use ) . Devices send data automatically modem Bluetooth . Modem receive transmits data simultaneously monitor device Central Monitoring Center ( CMC ) . Data receive modem encrypt sent telehealth monitoring platform via 3G signal . The CMC man registered nurse operate office hour , 7 day week . Nurses attend patient 's home : installation telehealth device ; perform thorough training patient / caregiver use equipment COPD telehealth program . Patients perform daily vital sign measurement time , rest , administration medication pattern oxygen use . Visionox® perform measurement respiratory rate oxygen adherence automatically . Measured data monitor daily base nurse CMC . CMC follow-up information , filter fle positives false negative , use application act traffic light system : - Green : meant measurement take within predefined limit , action require . - Yellow : `` technical alert '' . This mean measurement take receive . This alert could lead `` clinical alert '' due lack adherence discouragement . When parameter receive nurse CMC call patient find reason behind alert , either rule medical cause , one , notify researcher lead study . - Red : `` clinical alert '' . Meant measurement exceed limit previously preestablished . Classification severity clinical alert perform CMC accord algorithm . Depending n severity different early medical intervention take , escalated clinical responsible early intervention .</detailed_description>
