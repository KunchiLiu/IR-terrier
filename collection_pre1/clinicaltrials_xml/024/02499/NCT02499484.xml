	<brief_summary>The primary objective research determine addition topical GTN 24 week 12 week exercise programme improve clinical outcome placebo GTN people Achilles Tendinopathy . Pain Achilles tendon common condition see physiotherapist doctor . It affect people involved sport . It limit ability walk , hop , jump run . If pain persists longer 3 month become extremely difficult abolish . As result , people common condition suffer prolong pain often pain persist affect everyday activity . While easy injury diagnose , easy treat . Many treatment exist , often provide short-term relief pain return . Specific strengthen exercise show beneficial treat condition . The current project study Achilles tendon pain Irish adult Connolly Hospital , Dublin , take place 2015 2019 . In study , two group patient . Both group perform exercise program 12 week . Physiotherapists instruct perform exercise . Each group give ointment place sore tendon use applirule . This ointment apply daily 6 month . One group use ointment contain nitroglycerin , group use ointment active ingredient . This call placebo . The patient apply ointment daily 6 month . The patient assessed start program 6 , 12 24 week . Our main question see whether exercise program combine nitroglycerin ointment apply directly sore tendon improve outcome recovery time people suffer Achilles tendon pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Glyceryl Trinitrate ( GTN ) Eccentric Exercises Treatment Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design The study design meet CONSORT guideline . A randomized placebo control trial carry Physiotherapy Department Connolly Hospital , Blanchardstown , Dublin 15 . The study conduct patient present department diagnosis Achilles tendinopathy . The diagnosis confirm base history insidious onset Achilles tendon pain , tender nodule/thickening tendon region 2 6cm calcaneal insertion , ultrasound examination excludes frank tear . Participants randomly allocate one 2 group . Group 1 receive GTN 24 week combination supervise eccentric exercise programme deliver 12 week . Group 2 receive placebo GTN addition exercise programme . Ethical Considerations Ethics approval seek Connolly Hospital Research Ethics Committee . All participant give write informed consent . At patient 's initial assessment , follow complete - Outcome measure questionnaires - Victorian Institute Sport Assessment-Achilles ( VISA-A ) , Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS ) , Numeric Rating Scale pain ( NRS ) - Assessment Achilles tendon tenderness use pressure algometry - Ultra-sound assessment Achilles tendon - tendon thickness measurement - Proprioception testing ( modify Star Excursion Balance Test ) - Simple strength test Achilles , Hopping heel raise It anticipate baseline assessment take 60-75 minute complete . The follow-up assessment take 45 minute complete . Outcome Measures All outcomes administer baseline , week 6 , 12 24 principal investigator . Data adverse effect , compliance ointment application exercise program record schedule visit . Upon completion initial assessment principal investigator , participant schedule first exercise intervention session one physiotherapists Connolly Hospital . The treat physiotherapist train exercise protocol blind type GTN provide patient . This appointment schedule within one week lead investigator 's assessment . This tendon rehabilitation program design encompass current method non-operative treatment Achilles tendinopathy ( Paoloni et al , 2004 ) involve follow : - Instruction performance Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise program . - Patients advise avoid weight bear sport activity first 4 6 week , time gradual return sport encourage . Participation sport continue long pain increase NRS &gt; 3 increase Achilles morning stiffness experience . - Instruction performance daily static stretch gastrocnemius soleus muscle group - Patients advise avoid use co-interventions complimentary treatment duration study . Exercise intervention : Participants instruct perform Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise protocol ( Alfredson , 1998 ) physiotherapists Connolly Hospital . This perform first treatment session , take place approximately one week initial assessment . The participant give practical instruction write manual exercise program , include advice progression exercise regimen . Topical nitroglycerin ointment ( GTN ) The topical GTN use purpose trial Percutol . This deliver GTN ointment form . Participants instructed measure 0.5cm Percutol ointment apply 0.5cm Percutol paper applicator/strip , amount require indicated circular outline , measure approximately size pea . This paper applicator/strip place flat surface participant squeeze ointment onto paper , carefully measure amount specify paper applicator . Participants place paper painful area Achilles ointment contact skin , use paper lightly spread ointment cover painful area Achilles tendon . The ointment rubbed skin . The paper applicator cover surgical tape hold applicator place . The participant replace cap ointment screw tightly store per instruction ( room temperature reach sight child ) . Participants instructed wash hand process . The paper applicator Percutol ointment place affected area Achilles tendon morning leave situ daytime , remove participant sleeping night . It emphasize ointment must participant perform home exercise program ( HEP ) . 0.5cm Percutol choose purpose trial . Aspire Pharma United Kingdom ( UK ) manufacture Percutol inform PI 1 inch Percutol weigh 0.83g approximately correspond 16.64mg GTN . The PI conduct measure Percutol , 0.5cm Percutol weighs approximately 0.14 0.17g corresponds 2.8 3.4mg GTN . The placebo use purpose trial aqueous cream therefore contain GTN active ingredient , would assist tendon heal . Participants instruct apply amount placebo ointment exact method outline GTN group use paper/applicator method . Participants instruct use ointment initial visit lead investigator . They inform dose regimen call ointment apply painful area Achilles tendon leave situ 12 14 hour remove night prior sleep . This discard replace new measure ointment next day . Participants advise apply ointment site maximal tenderness within region 1-2 cm around point . The participant advise rotate paper applicator site maximal tenderness regular basis six-month duration study effort minimize irritation skin .</detailed_description>
