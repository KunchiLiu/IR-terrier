	<brief_summary>A prospective , interventional , monocentric , control randomize study compare conventional surgical technique surgical technique assistance Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide ( ACOG , Materialise ) System total hip replacement ( THR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monocentric Study Acetabulum Patient-specific Pin Drilling Guides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The Acetabular Cup Orientation Guide ( ACOG ) System MATERIALISE NV develop intend used surgical instrument assist position acetabular cup component intra-operatively use anatomical landmark pelvis clearly identifiable preoperative compute tomography ( CT ) image scan . Use ACOG relative new technique . ACOG , base CT image data , fit directly patient 's anatomy enable primary total hip replacement . Data show extra benefit technique compare conventional THR technique widely available . Aim : To determine safety new surgical technique compare conventional THR . Methods : 30 participant randomize 2 group . One group operate THR conventional technique group operate THR assistance ACOG System . CT image take pre post operatively measure cup orientation .</detailed_description>
