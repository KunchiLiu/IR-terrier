	<brief_summary>The purpose study 1. compare effect nifedipine GITS ramipril blood pressure variability subject elevate blood pressure variability . 2. ass whether degree treatment-induced change blood pressure variability , related degree regression ( progression ) organ damage heart , kidney carotid artery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REducing Blood Pressure Variability Essential Hypertension With RAmipril vErsus Nifedipine GITS Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated blood pressure variability ( BPV ) associate adverse cardiovascular outcome organ damage hypertensive subject . An antihypertensive treatment able reduce BPV independently BP lower effect might thus provide additional protection term cardiovascular risk subject elevate BPV , independently effect BP . However , data effect different class antihypertensive drug BPV limit inconsistent . Some study suggest possible usefulness calcium antagonist set . Based consideration investigator hypothesize calcium channel blocker nifedipine GITS , provide great BPV lower effect , compare ramipril , independently reduction mean BP level . Based consideration , primary objective study compare effect nifedipine GITS ramipril different estimate BPV ( 24 h BPV , home BPV , visit-to-visit BPV ) subject elevated BPV . The secondary objective ass whether degree treatment-induced change BPV , relate degree regression ( progression ) organ damage , account mean BP reduction treatment .</detailed_description>
