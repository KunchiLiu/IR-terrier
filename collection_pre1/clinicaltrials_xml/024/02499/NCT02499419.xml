	<brief_summary>Mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ) relatively common cardial problem one leaflets mitral valve prolapse systole leave atrium . The disease heterogeneous vary benign disease almost impact patient 's life severe cardiac problem many complication high mortality rate . The purpose study see investigator find relation severity MVP exercise capacity patient . The investigator also want see find difference exercise capacity mild MVP patient healthy people . To evaluate exercise capacity subject investigator use Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( CPET ) . CPET probably best know way get full picture subject 's function exercise . By combine gas exchange monitoring ECG control exercise subject reach maximal effort , test give information cardiac , pulmonary metabolic function subject . This information help identify problem perform exercise properly specifically limitation due cardiac , pulmonary metabolic problem .</brief_summary>
