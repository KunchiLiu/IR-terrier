	<brief_summary>Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) prognostic value several tumor type , increase evidence suggest molecular characterization CTCs serve `` liquid biopsy '' understand address treatment resistance . The goal proposal demonstrate CTCs accurately enumerate characterized metastatic clear cell renal cancer ( CCRC ) serve prognostic/predictive biomarkers improve treatment . The challenge surround CTC analysis CCRC CTC technology ( include clinical gold-standard CellSearch® ) depend epithelial marker EpCAM express low heterogeneous level CCRC . Members research team develop novel CTC microfluidic technology effectively detect CTCs completely undetectable CellSearch® low EpCAM expression , well allow CTC recovery downstream molecular characterization . The goal proposal therefore test hypothesis ( 1 ) The microfluidics CTC technology well sensitivity/specificity relative CellSearch metastatic CCRC ; ( 2 ) Enumeration CTCs metastatic CCRC patient ( n=66 ) prognostic value , molecular characterization CTCs expression biomarkers ( VHL , VEGF , mTOR , HIF1/HIF2 , AKT ) relate CCRC etiology predictive response/resistance target therapy . Although CCRC relatively uncommon , lack establish adjuvant treatment high cost target therapy palliative setting make search new prognostic/predictive biomarkers important clinical goal .</brief_summary>
