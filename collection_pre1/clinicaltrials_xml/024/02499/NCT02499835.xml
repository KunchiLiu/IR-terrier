	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot trial study vaccine therapy pembrolizumab treat patient prostate cancer respond treatment hormone ( hormone-resistant ) spread place body ( metastatic ) . Vaccines make deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine , may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may find tumor cell help kill . Giving pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine pembrolizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety pembrolizumab combination pTVG-HP ( pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine ) patient castration-resistant , metastatic prostate cancer . II . To determine 6-month progression-free survival median time radiographic progression patient castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treat pembrolizumab combination pTVG-HP . III . To evaluate anti-tumor response rate ( objective response rate prostate specific antigen [ PSA ] response rate , use Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 [ PCWG2 ] criterion ) patient castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treat pembrolizumab combination pTVG-HP . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether either treatment sequence , prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP ) -specific immune response , associate prolonged ( 6-month ) radiographic progression-free survival . II . To evaluate effect schedule ( concurrent versus delay administration pembrolizumab ) magnitude PAP-specific T-cell response , program death receptor-1 ( PD-1 ) expression circulate T cell , ligands PD-1 ( PD-L1 ) expression circulate epithelial cell ( CEC ) tumor biopsy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect treatment number circulate tumor cell . II . To evaluate PAP-specific antibody responses follow treatment pembrolizumab pTVG-HP DNA vaccine ( pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine ) . III . To determine whether either treatment sequence elicit immunologic antigen spread prostate-associated antigen . IV . To determine whether pre-existing vaccine-induced PD-L1 expression CEC tumor biopsy predictive objective clinical response . V. To determine whether treatment elicits expression regulatory molecule tumor-specific T cell ( e.g . hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 [ TIM3 ] , B T lymphocyte associate [ BTLA ] , lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [ LAG3 ] ) tumor cell ( e.g . tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily , member 14 [ HVEM ] , phosphatidyl serine , ligands programmed death receptor-2 [ PD-2 ] [ PD-L2 ] ) . VI . To determine whether PD-1-regulated antigen-specific T cell identify trans vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) test identify patient develop objective clinical response PD-1 blockade therapy combination pTVG-HP . VII . To determine whether change lymph node soft tissue tumor lesion observe fluorothymidine F-18 ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) treatment vaccine without pembrolizumab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine intradermally ( ID ) every week day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute every 3 week day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 . ARM II : Patients receive pTVG-HP plasmid DNA vaccine ID Arm I pembrolizumab IV 30 minute every 3 week day 85 , 106 , 127 , 148 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
