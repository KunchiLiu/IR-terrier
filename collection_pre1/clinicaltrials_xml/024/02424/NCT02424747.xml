	<brief_title>Long-term Survival Renal Outcomes Critically Ill Patients After Acute Kidney Injury : Swedish Multi-centre Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute kidney injury common amongst intensive care patient associate extremely high mortality morbidity term increase risk develop Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) . Patients CKD increase risk cardiovascular , cerebro-vascular disease long term increase risk death . Those patient progress ESRD 20 % mortality risk per year Sweden . Outcome acute kidney injury Swedish critical care population never previously describe . Method : This cohort study use Swedish national healthcare register investigate epidemiology acute kidney injury . The Swedish Intensive Care Register ( SIR ) provide population base , data extraction 2005 2011 . The information obtain cross-matched Swedish board health welfare ( Social Styrelsen ) national registry . All data return anonymized individual patient identified way . Additionally analysis perform group individual basis . The key data hold Swedish board health welfare . The national registry include Swedish Cause Death Register ( Dödsregister ) , Swedish renal register ( Svensknjurregistret ) out-patients register ( Öppen- slutenvårdsregister ) use obtain data cause mortality , co-morbidities , Pre Post ICU CKD ESRD . Epidemiological method use analyse data . Investigators aim describe outcome term long-term mortality ( five year ) renal morbidity ( incidence CKD ESRD ) critically ill patient without de novo AKI Sweden .</detailed_description>
