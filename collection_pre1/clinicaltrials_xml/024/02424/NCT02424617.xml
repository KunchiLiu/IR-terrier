	<brief_title>A Study BGB324 Combination With Erlotinib Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , multi-arm open-label Phase I/2 study conduct 11 clinical site US . Up approximately 66 patient histologically- cytologically-confirmed Stage IIIb Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer receive BGB324 single agent ( Run-in Cohort ( mono therapy ) ) combination erlotinib ( Arms A , B , C ) . Run-in Arm establish safety tolerability BGB324 administer single agent . BGB324 administer load dose 600 mg Day 1 Day 2 Cycle 1 , follow 200 mg daily thereafter . After 6 patient dose safety establish Arm A ( dose escalation arm ) open confirm BGB324 use combination erlotinib . In Arm A dose BGB324 escalate standard 3+3 fashion MTD combination ( BGB324+ erlotinib ) establish . The dose BGB324 investigate arm B C confirm upon recommendation Safety Review Committee . Arm B C open parallel investigate BGB324 combination erlotinib .</detailed_description>
