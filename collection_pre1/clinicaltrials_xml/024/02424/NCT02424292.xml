	<detailed_description>Rationale : Patients diagnose breast cancer generally fairly well prognosis estimate average survival rate 73 % five year survival rate 89 % developed country ( 1 ) . However , woman obese time breast cancer diagnosis seem risk bad breast cancer relate overall survival , compare normal weight counterpart . In addition , weight gain diagnosis might negatively associate prognosis . Possible mechanism explain association include host-related , tumour-related treatment-related factor ( 2 ) . Regular physical activity ( PA ) diagnosis breast cancer various beneficial effect respect overall survival ( 3 ) well health-related quality life ( 4 ) . The Dutch PA guideline `` Nederlandse Norm Gezond Bewegen ( NNGB ) '' recommend engage moderate-intensity exercise ( e.g . brisk walk ) least 30 minute day , least 5 day week ( 5 ) . For people overweight ( Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) recommend exercise least 60 minute moderate-intensity level , equal 3 Metabolic Equivalent Task Hours ( &gt; 3 MET/h ) , least 5 day week ( 6,7 ) . However , 61 % general population , meet guideline ( 8 ) among cancer patient percentage even less ( 9 ) . The recently publish national guideline oncological rehabilitation provide exercise goal , physical training base NNGB ( 5 ) well advice regard nutrition education maintain healthy lifestyle . The guideline emphasise importance tailor program , take account personal preference attitude concern physical exercise . Level PA self-efficacy ( belief one 's capability successfully execute required PA ) mention important predictor compliance . Weight gain common phenomenon among breast cancer patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy ( 10 ) well receive adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy ( 11 ) . While sufficient physical activity limitation amount weight gain important breast cancer patient , surely overweight obese patient . In province Groningen Drenthe , percentage overweight woman significantly high compare national average . In addition , area average socio-economic status ( SES ) , often associate unhealthy lifestyle , overweight see personal relevance health recommendation , low rest Netherlands . This leave group extra vulnerable kind health problem like diabetes mellitus , hypertension , increase risk cardiovascular disease decrease cancer relate survival . However , also know population difficult motivate engage physical activity . Therefore , uncertain guideline oncological rehabilitation sufficient enough reach NNGB goal . Oncological rehabilitation render health gain patient population , potentially limit weight gain , improve parameter metabolic syndrome improve health-related quality life . Objective : To increase percentage overweight breast cancer patient treat adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy reach goal NNGB oncological rehabilitation program 20 % . Secondary objective : To evaluate whether possible increase percentage patient meet NNGB sustain 26 week ( =3 month ) completion oncological rehabilitation . To evaluate effect oncological rehabilitation body composition include weight , parameter metabolic syndrome , health-related quality life self-efficacy patient population . Study design : The primary aim study determine whether oncological rehabilitation result reach goal NNGB overweight breast cancer patient . A single-arm , experimental pre-post test design , evaluate preliminary effectiveness 12-week personalised oncological rehabilitation program overweight obese ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) breast cancer patient , adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy use . The oncological rehabilitation program vary accord patient ' baseline characteristic , possible functional limitation personal preference . Assessment meeting NNGB ( accelerometry ) , body composition , parameter metabolic syndrome , health-related quality life self-efficacy , perform baseline , immediately completion 12 week study period follow-up 26 week baseline ( = 3 month completion intervention ) . Changes parameter baseline 12 week baseline 26 week analyse . The secondary aim establish effect physical activity prevalence metabolic syndrome , quality life self-efficacy group patient . These secondary parameter assess positive reinforcement patient continue engage physical activity . Study population : 141 overweight obese ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) woman 18-75 year old treat adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy breast cancer . Intervention : Patients offer personalised program follow guideline oncological rehabilitation , period 12 week facilitate stepwise increase level PA meeting PA guideline overweight/obese people . To explore physical activity patient ask wear accelerometer 1 week start oncology rehabilitation program ( baseline ) . For patient already meet guideline baseline , program stimulate keep aspect achieve healthy lifestyle discuss together physiotherapist . Hereto patient intake physiotherapist oncology rehabilitation program assess personal preference regard physical activity , hinder factor well functional limitation individual patient . Possible solution hinder factor seek . Based patient 's individual characteristic preference , physiotherapist create tailor PA program individual patient stimulate meeting PA guideline end study period . To facilitate meeting guideline , patient follow supervised PA program ( individual group-wise ) 2-3 time week , combination unsupervised home-based program ( individual group-wise ) supervise program . Activities engage gradually increased duration per session and/or intensity . In addition , incorporate physical activity daily routine ( household activity , go shop bike instead car ) stimulate . All patient follow-up conversation skype/facetime telephone 1 , 3 7 week . Evaluation set goal , possible hinder factor overcome , encouragement - need consultation physiotherapist - set new realistic goal next period standard part follow-up conversation . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint : The percentage patient meet Dutch PA guideline overweight/obese people ( ≥ time one hour per week ) completion 12 week intervention . Meeting guideline measure accelerometry ( 12 ) . Secondary endpoint : - Sustainability possible increase percentage patient meet Dutch PA guideline overweight obese people 3 month completion intervention . - Changes body composition ( weight , BMI , fat percentage measure skinfold measurement ) , parameter metabolic syndrome ( waist circumference , blood pressure , fast blood glucose , high density lipoprotein , triglyceride ) , health-related quality life ( use EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC BR23 single question satisfaction life ) general PA self-efficacy ( use ALCOS PA self-efficacy questionnaire respectively ) , baseline,12 week baseline 26 week thereafter . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Despite participation study reserve without contra-indication physical exercise despite conclusion American College Sports Medicine Roundtable Exercise Guidelines Cancer Survivors exercise safe cancer treatment ( 13 ) , physical exercise always risk ( sport ) strain/injury . However , regard nature target intensity exercise ( moderate ) , risk low investigator expect benefit ( physically psychologically ) far outweigh possible risk . At baseline 12 26 week thereafter , follow assessment perform : measurement physical activity accelerometer , measurement body composition ( weight , BMI , fat percentage measure skinfold measurement ) , parameter metabolic syndrome ( include measure waist circumference blood pressure , draw blood measure fast blood glucose , high density lipoprotein triglyceride ) . In addition , fill questionnaire general physical activity ( ALCOS ) PA self-efficacy ( PA self-efficacy questionnaire ) , health-related quality life include satisfaction ( EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC BR23 single question satisfaction life ) part study . Information questionnaires find Appendix 5 . At baseline , questionnaire regard baseline characteristic ( marital status , education level , employment status , monthly household income , advise exercise treat oncologist , diet purpose lose weight , know diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , current medication stage behavioural change ) fill . Medical record view researcher additional patient characteristic like tumour stage diagnosis ( see 5.1.3 ) .</detailed_description>
