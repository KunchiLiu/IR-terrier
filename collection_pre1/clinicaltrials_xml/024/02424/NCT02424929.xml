	<brief_summary>The goal study compare surgical outcome deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery patient deeply sedate , `` asleep , '' sedate , `` awake , '' surgical implantation DBS electrode . The investigator hypothesize clinical outcome , neurophysiological finding , surgical accuracy equivalent . There 3 specific aim : 1 ) compare activity neuron patient ' brain asleep awake group use microelectrode recording , see affect clinical outcome capability microelectrode recording macrostimulation identify subthalamic nucleus asleep patient . 2 ) Determine intraoperative CT scan DBS electrode sufficient accurate DBS electrode placement . 3 ) Compare clinical outcome Parkinson 's disease awake asleep DBS patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient undergo DBS surgery use regular surgical technique . In surgery halo attach skull . A CT scan obtain . MRI - base target conduct identify target location implant electrode deep brain . The patient burr hole place behind hair line frontal lobe . Then guide tube insert brain . Neurophysiological identification confirmation target conduct multiple technique include microelectrode record listen single neuron brain , macrostimulation test clinical effect . The electrode implant clinical effect test . The halo remove patient take recovery room . Patients randomize undergo surgery awake asleep . Our current standard surgical technique awake intravenous anesthesia use briefly drill burr hole skull . But selected case patient remain sedated throughout entire surgery . Patients asleep group intravenous anesthesia maintain throughout entire case . Standard intraoperative neurophysiological imaging technique use . In awake patient technique use identify confirm DBS electrode implant accurate position . These technique include microelectrode record individual neuron monitor electrode insert brain tissue . Early research report suggest sedation may affect neuronal activity . But preliminary data indicates still reliable intravenous anesthesia . Macrostimulation use implanted DBS electrode suppress tremor , stiffness , slowness Parkinson 's disease , assist confirmation electrode position . It also cause side effect include tingling , facial contraction . These method also study asleep patient . The O-arm intraoperative CT scanner visualize DBS electrode . O-arm image obtain standard fashion group . The accuracy intraoperative imaging compare standard postoperative MRI . The clinical outcome two technique compare . The clinical outcome measure standard Parkinson 's disease research tool include video tap independently rat motor exam , well Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) . Gait analysis collect use APDM system . These test 3 month surgery neurologist .</detailed_description>
