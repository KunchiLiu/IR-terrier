	<brief_title>Methylprednisolone Treatment Friedreich Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) progressive neurodegenerative disease child adult presently therapy . One hallmarks FRDA deficiency frataxin protein , cause dysregulation iron metabolism , lack detoxification , increase iron bioavailability . The accumulation iron mitochondrion lead increase sensitivity oxidative stress . A secondary inflammatory response also propose present FRDA , reveal autopsy study alteration immune pathway microarray analysis . Inflammation FRDA raise possibility therapeutic benefit anti-inflammatory steroid treatment , inflammation may directly underlie multiple complication FRDA include cardiomyopathy . In support theory clinical observation patient self-reports improvement ataxia symptom follow prescription steroid indication primary FRDA diagnosis . Objectives : Primary : To assess effect oral administration methylprednisolone functional performance score patient FRDA use Timed 25-Foot Walk ( T25FW ) . Secondary : To assess effect methylprednisolone neurological performance measure ( Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale , 9-Hole Peg Test , 1-minute walk , home-based measure gait , hand function speech assess smartphone application ) ass safety tolerability methylprednisolone FRDA population . Study Design : This study open-label clinical trial methylprednisolone patient FRDA . Setting/Participants : This study take place Children 's Hospital Philadelphia outpatient trial 5 child least 5 year less 10 year age , 5 adult age 45 year old , genetically confirm FRDA . See description study intervention measure .</detailed_description>
