	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate ability image device , develop AdOM Advanced Optical Technologies Ltd. ( `` AdOM '' ) . AdOM produce image device base standard fundus camera use white light , combine new algorithm allow new reconstruction three-dimensional image . The material Medical Instrumentation Device comprise optical component ( lens ) , broadband light source power , mechanical engine , beam splitter , optical filter . The device addition contain camera sensor spectral detector . These element link computer include control software user interface . The device allow three-dimensional image ocular tissue , specifically tear film layer retinal layer . In initial study , device use assess tear film coat corneal surface healthy subject well moderate-to-severe Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca ( KCS ) Dry Eye Syndrome ( DES ) . The ability device ass retinal layer evaluate second phase study . The aqueous layer tear layer thickness expect measured accuracy level approximately one nanometer . All value measure time thus possible deduce breakup time tear layer evaporation rate . It possible information also provide mucin layer level sharpness . Using device include follow step : 1 . Resting head fix assistance chin forehead rest . 2 . Locating focus device cornea retina help examiner . 3 . Identifying retinal vitreous layer press start measurement , alternatively : 4 . Identifying tear film layer press start measurement . 5 . Pressing button end measurement . The expected measurement duration 20 70 second . Analysis return light describe second thickness layer continuity surface . Study population : A total 20 healthy patient . A total 40 adult male female patient moderate-to-severe KCS DES . Conduct Study : This case-control , non-randomized observational study . The study include two visit : screen visit study visit . During screen visit patient sign inform consent form full medical history record . All ocular sign symptom evaluate full biomicroscopic examination perform . Disease activity assess use Dry Eye Symptom Score ( DESS ) , Schirmer Test ( ST ) , tear meniscus height ( TM ) , tear break-up time ( BUT ) , fluorescein staining ( FS ) . The second visit schedule 4 week screen visit . During second visit ( photography session ) , ocular sign symptom evaluate full biomicroscopic examination perform . Disease activity assess use Dry Eye Symptom Score ( DESS ) , Schirmer Test ( ST ) , tear meniscus height ( TM ) , tear break-up time ( BUT ) , fluorescein staining ( FS ) . The tear film layer photograph investigational device participation volunteer study end end photography session . Time frame : participant follow duration participation study expect 4 week .</detailed_description>
