	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) + memory T-cells work consolidative therapy follow donor non-myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant treat patient leukemia lymphoma . Giving total lymphoid irradiation anti-thymocyte globulin donor hematopoietic cell transplant help stop growth cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell ( call graft-versus-host disease ) . Giving cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happen . Once donated stem cell begin work , patient 's immune system may see remain cancer cell belong patient 's body destroy . Giving infusion donor 's white blood cell , CD8+ memory T-cells , may boost effect may effective treatment kill cancer cell may leave body ( consolidative therapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate conversion full donor chimerism ( FDC ) follow post transplant infusion ( day 30-60 ) freshly enrich allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) , receive non-myeloablative total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) transplant conditioning . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine risk disease progression , overall event free survival , non-relapse mortality . II . To determine incidence acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) follow infusion allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells . OUTLINE : Patients undergo TLI day -11 -7 -4 -1 receive ATG per standard institutional practice day -11 -7 . Patients also receive cyclosporine orally ( PO ) daily start day -3 continue least 6 month post-transplant . Patients undergo non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) day 0 . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO daily begin day 0 continue day 28 . Based patient 's status initial transplant , patient receive CD8+ memory T-cells intravenously ( IV ) 10-20 minute sometime day 30 day 60 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
