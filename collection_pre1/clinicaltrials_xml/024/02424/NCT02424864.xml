	<detailed_description>Patients receive normal 3D FDG PET-CT scan . By participate trial , one extra 4D CT scan make . For PET 4D CT acquisition , patient get abdominal belt around waist register breathe motion . No extra FDG PET scan require study . The 4D CT scan intervention increase radiation dose exposure compare standard PET-CT scan . However , comparison expect radiation dose deliver , patient treat curative chemoradiotherapy , increase radiation dose negligible secondary risk due intervention therefore increase . For patient eligible curative treatment extra dose also relevant , give life expectancy group .</detailed_description>
