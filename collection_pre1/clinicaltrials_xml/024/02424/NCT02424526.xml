	<brief_title>Intensive Home-based Treadmill Training Walking Attainment Young Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine optimal parameter dose home-based treadmill train compare high-intensity ( 5 days/week , twice daily 10-20 min 6 week ) low-intensity ( 2 days/week , daily 10-20 minute 6 week ) treadmill train ; compare effect high- versus low-intensity treadmill train walk attainment overall walking activity young child cerebral palsy . Hypotheses - A intensive protocol treadmill train increase walk onset young child CP . - A intensive protocol treadmill train increase overall walking activity young child CP . Specific Aims - To determine optimal parameter dose home-based treadmill train compare high-intensity low-intensity home-based treadmill training . - To compare effect high- versus low-intensity treadmill train walk onset overall walking activity . Study design •Prospective randomize control trial Study population •Two group 12 child CP age 3 year walk yet receive either home-based high-intensity treadmill train low-intensity treadmill training . The child assess , immediately , 1-month 4-months follow intervention via standardized outcome measure .</detailed_description>
