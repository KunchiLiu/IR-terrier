	<brief_title>Recurrency After Inguinal Herniorraphy With Bi-layer Mesh ( BLM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Surgical repair inguinal hernia common surgical procedure world . Since introduction repair mesh reinforcement , relapse decrease significantly . Recurrence inguinal hernia affect 1-2 % inguinal hernia repair ( IHR ) [ 1 ] longer consider big problem . One problem large proportion patient undergo surgery develop chronic pain surgical area [ 2-4 ] . New mesh , new design new material continuously introduce , aim reduce incidence chronic pain . One common mesh use today so-called `` double-mesh '' ( bi-layer mesh ) [ 1 , 5 ] . Several study show bi-layer mesh lead gain patient initially surgery , scientific evidence available suggest bi-layer mesh superior traditional tension-free mesh repair long term [ 6 , 7 ] . Several report show bi-layer mesh repair give result good golden standard method , single sheet mesh use . The surgical technique differ somewhat respect layer abdominal use [ 8 ] , use bi-layer- single sheet mesh . With bi-layer mesh use abdominal layer usually use ( pre-peritoneal space ) case re-operation due recurrence open mesh repair . Re-operation bi-layer mesh IHR incompletely study unclear difficult surgical procedure compare re-operation recurrence standard IHR . Aim The overall aim study improve outcome IHR . It known today re-operation due recurrence bi-layer mesh IHR complicate compare golden standard method . Method This project registry study . The National hernia register ( Svenskt bråckregister , SBR ) start 1992 include data cover nearly 100 % country 's hernia operation . Patient data collect SBR . Patients time surgery 18-75 year age operate due primary inguinal hernia two mention technique 1992-2012 eligible . Statistics Parametric non-parametric statistical method descriptive analysis use comparison within group . Students t-test . Power calculation The primary outcome variable registry study prevalence recurrence bi-layer mesh IHR . This incompletely map . There need power calculation material registry large relevant difference group easily detect . Gain knowledge The result study could show either method IHR ( eg bi-layer mesh ) less suitable surgical repair inguinal hernia , could troublesome patient surgery method .</detailed_description>
