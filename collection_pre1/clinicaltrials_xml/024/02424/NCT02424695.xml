	<detailed_description>Evidence Sleep Heart Health Study suggest nocturnal arousal sleep impact heart rate variability sleep disorder associate frequent nocturnal arousal , include restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) , increase risk develop cardiovascular disease . The majority RLS patient , asleep , exhibit frequent periodic limb movement ( PLMs ) , cause electroencephalographic ( EEG ) arousal sleep fragmentation result poor quality sleep daytime consequence . PLMs also report increase heart rate.The precise nature relationship PLMs impact heart rate blood pressure clear . This may relate fact PLMs score either present absent without account difference intensity muscle activity individual PLMs intensity associate arousal . In fact PLMs report vary barely visible intense change anterior tibialis electromyogram ( EMG ) . This study evaluate effect gabapentin encarbil ( GEn ) intensity cortical arousal associate PLMs use newly develop computer assist score system allow scale microarousals EEG . The anterior tibialis EMG intensity , continuous blood pressure heart rate measure . The study design phase IV single center , single blind , placebo run-in fix dose single group study twenty subject moderate severe restless leg syndrome . It include one- three week screen washout period , one week placebo run-in four- week treatment period GEn 600 mg daily . Subjects instruct take study medication daily food even approximately 5 PM . If dose take recommended time , next dose take following day regularly schedule time ( 5 PM next evening ) . Subjects blind treatment ( placebo versus active drug ) . Polysomnography ( PSG ) obtain two night baseline end placebo run-in end four week treatment gabapentin encarbil 600 mg. Medical history cardiovascular risk factor assess Screening . RLS disease history , previous/current RLS therapy , augmentation history evidence sleep disturbance obtained.Severity RLS determine use International Restless Legs Syndrome ( IRLS ) scale . The Berlin questionnaire use identify risk ( low high ) sleep disordered breathing . The Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) administer identify depression severity Screening . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory test urine pregnancy test conduct Screening determine eligibility . Also determine eligibility , subjective evidence sleep disturbance assess per daily sleep diary Visit 2 . A physical exam perform begin Placebo Run-in Period . The visit schedule include : Screening ; Scheduled Tests/Exams ; Placebo administration visit ; Baseline PSG visit ; Baseline Visit ; End treatment PSG visit ; Adverse Event Evaluation ( subject ) ; Unscheduled clinical evaluation visit ; End Study Visit . Primary outcome involve change baseline ( end run-in period ) cortical arousal intensity associate PLMs subject treat Gen 600 mg QD 4 week . PSG study record 8 hour use standard technique describe R &amp; K . Cortical EEG arousal score use wavelet analysis C3/A2 C4/A1 EEG signal . Arousals score NREM sleep assign score 0-9 . This arousal scale entirely subjective . Wavelet analysis perform scaled arousal use wavelet feature correlate arousal intensity . The arousal intensity measure use Wavelet Transform superior analyze signal EEG . Beat beat heart rate measurement identify high value interval 2-12 second precede arousal use baseline heart rate . The high heart rate interval arousal 8 second end , difference baseline represent change heart rate associate arousal . Blood pressure change identify use technique heart rate change . Continuous blood pressure monitor use Somnotouch RESP . Using 2-12 second precede arousal , identify change onset arousal 8 second end represent change blood pressure . PLM intensity derive measure high anterior tibialis EMG amplitude 2-12 second prior arousal onset compare maximum EMG amplitude PLMs without associate arousal . The Rechtschaffen Kales ( R &amp; K ) standard PSG parameter include : TST ( total sleep time ) , WASO ( wake sleep onset ) , LPS10 ( latency persistent sleep ) , SE ( sleep efficiency ) , Awakenings Index ( number awakening per hour sleep ) , AI ( arousal index ) , sleep stage percentage , PLMI ( periodic limb movement per hour ) , PLMAI ( periodic limb movement associate arousal per hour ) . The secondary subjective efficacy endpoint : 1 ) mean change Baseline end Treatment Period International Restless Legs Syndrome ( IRLS ) Rating Scale total score , ( 2 ) proportion responder ( `` much '' / `` much '' improve ) investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement ( CGI-I ) scale , proportion responder ( `` moderately well '' `` great deal well '' ) Patient Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) scale ( 4 ) mean change baseline end Treatment Period PSQ , SSQ item , RLSQoL , RLS-NDI ESS score The IRLSSG develop validate 10-item scale assess severity RLS . The IRLS Rating scale assess screen visit , placebo initiation visit , baseline visit end study visit ( ET visit subject withdraw prematurely ) . The investigator-rated CGI-I record Baseline ( end placebo administration ) end Treatment Period ET visit , applicable . The PSQ self-rated questionnaire ass sleep quality sleep disturbance one month time interval . The RLSQoL 18-item scale ass impact RLS daily life , emotional wellbeing , social life , work life . The ESS assessment use measure average longtime sleepiness whereby subject self-rate question likely fall asleep eight different situation . The PSQ , RLSQoL ESS record Baseline end Treatment Period ET visit , applicable . The SSQ daily sleep diary subject record sleep activity report quality sleep past 24 hour 11 point numeric rating scale range 0 ( `` poor '' ) 10 ( `` excellent '' ) . The RLS-NDI measure impact RLS next day function . The impact include activity daily live ( i.e. , work , household chore ) , cognitive functioning ( i.e. , concentration , forgetfulness , mental tiredness , alertness ) , emotional functioning ( i.e. , irritability , depress mood ) , physical functioning ( i.e. , physical tiredness , active leisure activity ) , energy , daytime sleepiness , social functioning ( i.e. , relationship , social activities/situations ) . The final measure consist 14 item assess `` today '' rat numeric rating scale . Subjects instruct complete daily diary RLS-NDI 7 day precede Visit 4 ( PSG 2 visit ) Visit 7 ( PSG 4 visit ) . The following safety assessment perform study : Physical examination , include height screening measurement ; Weight measurement ; Vital sign measurement , include blood pressure pulse rate ; Pregnancy test ; AE reporting ; ECG ( screen ) ; Laboratory safety test ( screen ) The primary efficacy endpoint reduction placebo-baseline cortical arousal intensity associate PLMs treatment GEn. A sample size 20 subject estimate priori power analysis ( G*Power 3.1.9.2 ) achieve 92 % power 2-sided 5 % paired t-test effect size 0.80 . The primary efficacy analysis perform per-protocol population complete study take 600 mg GEn/day study drug . For subject prematurely withdraw study , EOS PSG acquire provide receive least 2 week treatment GEn. All data primary secondary endpoint analyze use pair t-test . 95 % confidence interval provide true mean treatment difference . Descriptive statistic report primary secondary endpoint placebo-baseline visit treatment group . To evaluate treatment effect , association change baseline primary objective secondary subjective endpoint evaluate use Pearson correlation coefficient . Safety tolerability analyse focus primarily frequency treatment emergent adverse event .</detailed_description>
