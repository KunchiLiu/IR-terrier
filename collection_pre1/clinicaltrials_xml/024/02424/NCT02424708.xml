	<detailed_description>The study begin pre-screening telephone interview . During conversation participant ask series question help u identify whether eligible participation study . The pre-screening interview process take approximately 10 minute include screen criterion require clinical laboratory examination All routine research visit take place Bastyr University Campus ( Kenmore , WA ) . Participants ask schedule visit approximately time day visit .If medication , would like take medication normally would day visit . Participants randomly assign one three different study groups- low dose group , high dose group , placebo group . Study participant invite volunteer two magnetic resonance imagine ( MRI ) scan part study , optional part study participation . For volunteer qualify , MRIs perform University Washington Radiology Department early morning . One scan take baseline take glutathione second upon completion study medication . There separate consent form participate image portion study . Among participant volunteer , first 15 qualify MRI scan schedule accord MRI availability . If participant enrol study , ask keep daily log actual frequency administration study medication , , well change PD symptom , adverse event might experience , general well-being . We give participant enough medication last four week , date next appointment . The medication take three time day ( morning , afternoon , even ) . Visit 1- Baseline : ( Approximately 1 hour ) - Urine sample - Venipuncture ( blood draw , ( 40 mL / ~3 Tbsp ) ass blood antioxidant status.. - Clinical assessment PD severity : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , involve assess degree tremor , ability walk across room , question ability function independently ( i.e . button shirt , feed ) , question mental health , include depression intellectual impairment . - Participant taught administer study medication give 1-month supply . Visit 2- Week 4 follow-up : ( Approximately 1 hour ) - Urine sample - Venipuncture ( blood draw , ( 40 mL / ~3 Tbsp ) ass blood antioxidant status.. - Clinical assessment PD severity : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Webster-Step Second test involve assess degree tremor , ability walk across room , question ability function independently ( i.e . button shirt , feed ) , question mental health , include depression intellectual impairment . - Participant ask return unused study medication applicator tip first month study give next 1-month supply . - We inquire medication change collect medication use log . Visit 3- Week 8 follow-up : ( Approximately 1/2 hour ) - Participant ask return unused study medication second month study give next 1-month supply . - We inquire medication change collect medication use log . Visit 4- Week 12 follow-up : ( Approximately 1 hour ) - Urine sample - Venipuncture ( blood draw , ( 40 mL / ~3 Tbsp ) ass blood antioxidant status.. - Clinical assessment PD severity : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) ass degree tremor , ability walk across room , question ability function independently ( i.e . button shirt , feed ) , question mental health , include depression intellectual impairment . - Participants ask return unused study medication third month study . - We inquire medication change collect medication use log . Visit 5- Week 16 follow-up : ( Approximately 1 hour ) This visit include determine whether last effect study medication one month follow discontinuation use . The visit include : - Urine sample - Venipuncture ( blood draw , ( 40 mL / ~3 Tbsp ) ass blood antioxidant status.. - Clinical assessment PD severity : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) involve assess degree tremor , ability walk across room , question ability function independently ( i.e . button shirt , feed ) , question mental health , include depression intellectual impairment . Overall , approximately 5 hour require study participation . Blood draw occur , visit , exceed 4 Tbsp per month .</detailed_description>
