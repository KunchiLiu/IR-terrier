	<brief_summary>For ten year , French group ASUR ( ASthme aux URgences ) study asthmatic disease . The first epidemiological study enrol 3.772 patient , 37 emergency service , show treatment protocol acute asthma attack homogeneous oral corticosteroid prescribe 50 % case . The second major French study emergency department group enrol 3.049 patient . The result show 38 % patient new acute asthma relapse month follow consultation emergency department . In study , multivariate analysis predictor relapse show controllable factor ( absence write recommendation discharge , 50 % prescription oral corticosteroid discharge emergency department , limit follow-up general practitioner ( GP ) pneumologist ... ) . The emergency physician responsibility educate patient period acute asthma attack return stability long term therapy . To date , impact patient education rate consultation emergency department proven , although seem positive trend effect . In France , half patient come emergency department asthma attack hospitalize . More third return ED within first 30 day new attack . The impact post-interventional education relapse explore . A first major study strict formalize protocol design reduce relapse rate essential could allow major improvement . Our main objective ass impact strict formalize protocol care asthmatic patient discharge Emergency Department recurrence rate asthma attack , one month asthma attack . The expected benefit patient short-term reduction relapse asthma exacerbation , thus avoid problem readmission . The strict formalize discharge protocol would also improve education term self-medication gray zone post-therapeutic monitoring . The benefit even important term public health due important prevalence asthma world country . The advantage protocol strengthen link hospital GPs . Education asthmatic patient essential reduce morbidity . Thus , potential benefit protocol : reduce cost health re-hospitalization , improve education asthma patient , strengthen link require GP , decrease absenteeism usually frequent type disease workplace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Relapse Rate One Month After Discharge From Emergency Department Asthmatic Patients Given Strict Formalized Follow Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective To assess impact strict formalize protocol care asthmatic patient discharge Emergency Department recurrence rate asthma attack , one month asthma attack . Secondary objective Assess impact strict formalize protocol rate hospitalization one month discharge ED . Assess rate early recurrence asthma attack within first 15 day discharge ED . Assess control asthmatic disease one month discharge ED , use recognize tool , Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . Assess compliance rate patient recommend therapeutic strategy . Primary end point : Recurrence rate asthma attack diagnose GP ED doctor , one month discharge ED . Secondary end point : Recurrence rate asthma attack 15 day +/-2 discharge ED . Rate hospitalization within 30 day +/-2 discharge ED Score asthma control test ( ACT ) 30 day +/-2 discharge ED . Rate patient 's adherence protocol : count number GINA ( 6 ) discharge recommendation follow group Percentage patient purchase peak expiratory flow meter D30 +/-2 First day contact general practitioner leave Emergency Department . Percentage patient ' follow-up general practitioner D30 +/-2 Percentage patient use peak expiratory flow meter D30 +/-2 . We classify four category use PEF : daily , weekly , less week , never . Percentage patient self-medicating call doctor Experimental plan Multicenter , prospective , cluster-randomized , open study , enrol cohort patient manage emergency department acute asthma attack admission criterion end treatment . Forty-six Emergency Departments select national territory , randomize cluster ( center A [ control=standard group ] , center B [ treatment group= strict formalize protocol ] stratify size ( number patient per year ) type [ CHU , CHG , CHR ] ) . The two group patient contact telephone Day 15 +/-2 , Day 30 +/-2 discharge order identify possible relapse , collect various element evolution disease well answer formalize questionnaire . Relapse define respiratory discomfort due asthma require medical assistance ( emergency department GP ) . Number patient need : A sample size N= 466 patients/group allow 80 % power detect 30 % relative difference recurrence ( i.e . 25 % 17.5 % ) chi-square test two-sided 5 % significance level . Considering attrition rate around 5 % study cluster- randomized design , apply variance inflation factor equal 1.5 ( base previous study ) .</detailed_description>
