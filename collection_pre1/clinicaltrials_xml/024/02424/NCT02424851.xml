	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness bortezomib versus thalidomide reduce free light chain blood myeloma patient . In addition participant receive bendamustine ( chemotherapy ) dexamethasone ( steroid ) , increase effectiveness bortezomib thalidomide . The trial also study whether early reduction free light chain increase chance kidney recover .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimising Renal Outcome Myeloma Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal impairment life threaten condition myeloma . 20-25 % patient present diagnosis renal dysfunction . Outcome poor due high early mortality , 28 % newly diagnose myeloma patient myeloma trial renal failure survive beyond 100 day , compare 10 % overall . This study aim establish : 1 . Whether proteosomal inhibition ( bortezomib ) immunomodulatory ( thalidomide ) base therapy achieves threshold reduction serum free light chain ( sFLCs ) significant majority patient . 2 . Whether sFLC response first 2 cycle ( early responder ) predict haematological renal response next 2 cycle therapy . 3 . An early time point assessment sFLC reduction biomarker response . Participants stratify age chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stage receive either bortezomib , bendamustine dexamethasone ( BBD ) thalidomide , bendamustine dexamethasone ( BTD ) .</detailed_description>
