In consideration previously treat subject , however , dose bendamustine decide 80mg/m2 study protocol concern toxicity , especially severe cytopenia . Dexamethasone one corticosteroid use key drug lymphoid malignancy strong antiemetic effect .

	<brief_title>Bendamustine , Carboplatin Dexamethasone ( BCD ) Refractory Relapsed Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) represent heterogeneous group nodal extranodal mature T-cell lymphoma , constitute 5 - 10 % non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHLs ) Western country compare 20 - 30 % lymphoma East Asia . The common histology include PTCL , otherwise specify ( PTCL-NOS ) , angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) [ 3 ] . Most subtypes include high percentage patient advance disease stage , widespread dissemination aggressive behavior . As result , prognosis PTCL remain dismal , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) rate many subtypes range 25 45 % , except ALCL ( ALK ) , demonstrate well 5-year OS ( 70 % ) [ 4 - 6 ] . Thus , new therapeutic strategy need improve survival patient PTCL . Current multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen patient PTCL extrapolate mainly therapeutic paradigm B-cell lymphoma , cornerstone treatment anthracycline-containing regimen . Although patient PTCL cure approach , relapse chemorefractory disease constitute significant clinical dilemma care patient [ 7 ] . At present , high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support seem offer potential curative treatment patient relapse PTCL responsive salvage chemotherapy [ 8 ] . However , majority elderly patient relapse refractory PTCL benefit high dose chemotherapy result advance age , significant comorbidities , poor functional status , toxicity previous treatment inherent chemoresistance [ 9 ] . Conventional salvage regimen mostly design young fitter population , hardly deliver elderly patient due mark hematologic non-hematologic toxicity , mainly involve renal neurological function [ 10 ] . Therefore , imperative innovative salvage regimen base drug combination increase efficacy reduce toxicity explore management elderly patient relapse refractory PTCLs . BCD chemotherapy regimen propose salvage treatment relapse refractory PTCLs study protocol , would expect show promising clinical outcome bendamustine single therapy . Platinum combination bendamustine theoretically ideal salvage regimen patient PTCLs agent highly effective drug lymphoma treatment rare cross-resistance . Carboplatin select platinum agent combination bendamustine , second generation platinum agent less neurotoxicity cisplatin , consider use previously treat patient vinc alkaloid agent .</detailed_description>
