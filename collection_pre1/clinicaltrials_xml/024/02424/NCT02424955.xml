	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective prospective pilot study : 1. determine feasibility reproducibility 3D contrast enhance ultrasound image liver cancer patient undergo Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy 2. evaluate whether treatment induce early change image metric derive 3D contrast enhance ultrasound . This study provide valuable insight potential baseline and/or early post-treatment 3D ultrasound perfusion characteristic ( measurement blood-flow ) primary metastatic liver tumor predict tumor response Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy . The investigator ' underlie goal ass whether early perfusion change 1-7 day SABR initiation use non-invasive early biomarker treatment response assessment . Secondary Objectives : Evaluate feasibility contrast-enhanced ultrasound-to-CT fusion assist three-dimensional ( 3D ) perfusion ultrasound ( US ) image optical electromagnetic track ultrasound probe patient liver cancer undergo CT treatment plan and/or response evaluation .</brief_summary>
