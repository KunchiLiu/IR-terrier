	<brief_title>Study Determine Feasibility , Evaluability Variability Markers Drug Action Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim determine feasibility sample evaluability biomarkers CRPC tissue sample circulate tumour cell ( CTCs ) . Exploratory biomarker analysis may include , limited , understanding potential proof mechanism ( POM ) , proof principle ( POP ) predictive biomarkers response potential therapeutic agent CRPC patient , factor may influence development CRPC . This study predicate continued development agent target PI3K pathway AZD ( AstraZeneca Drug ) 8186 ( PI3Kb ) ; AZD5363 ( Akt ) AZD2014 ( mTOR ) anti-hormonals expect deliver benefit management tumour dependent PI3K signal result e.g . phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) deficiency androgen receptor activation . Loss PTEN common CRPC . Current data indicate AZD8186 inhibit PI3K downstream signal PTEN deficient PTEN proficient cell hence POM efficacy need determine tumour PTEN protein loss . In future study , pair biopsy tumour tissue accessible assessment POM PTEN status , either bone metastasis lymph node metastasis , within prostate tumour . Recruitment patient carry two stage follow : Stage 1 The first 10 eligible consent patient enrol study undergo sequential biopsy . For stage one participant , PTEN status retrospectively determine archival tumour sample immuno-histochemistry ( IHC ) . The result PTEN analysis Stage 1 , determine number patient Stage 2 must PTEN positive PTEN null . For study intent equal number type i.e . ten PTEN positive ten PTEN null . Stage 2 In Stage 2 , patient ask sign pre-screening consent form archival tumour sample analyse PTEN status prior undergo main study screening procedure . If PTEN status match one available slot enrol study . Once cohort reach ten PTEN positive ten PTEN null patient , close recruitment .</detailed_description>
