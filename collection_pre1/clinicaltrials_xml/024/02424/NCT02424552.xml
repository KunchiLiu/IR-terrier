	<brief_title>Effect Vitamin D add-on Therapy Vitamin D Insufficient Patients With Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients severe asthma represent great unmet medical need among asthmatic population , particular due high risk severe exacerbation . A substantial proportion patient achieve asthma control despite even high-dose ICS LABA treatment , necessitate add-on therapy . For patient oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) prefer treatment modality , inevitably lead severe side effect . A high Proportion patient severe Asthma Vitamin D insufficient ( &lt; 30 ng/ml ) . It therefore tempt speculate vitamin D substitution vitamin D insufficient patient continue experience suboptimal asthma control ICS LABA ICS/LABA plus OCS treatment may boost corticosteroid responsiveness , thereby potentially reduce corticosteroid dose requirement improve key parameter asthma control . The present study multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety treatment vitamin D dose 4000 IU/day administer daily follow single load dose 100 000 IU upon study entry period 24 week patient severe asthma vitamin D insufficiency . During study , patient remain existing maintenance asthma therapy throughout study , addition study treatment , reduce inhaled oral steroid accord study protocol . The study consist 2-week run-in period , 24 week double-blind treatment period include 12 week steroid stable phase two steroid reduction phase , follow follow-up visit 4 week last study medication intake . The active treatment arm study standard care plus vitamin D ( load dose 100 000 IU upon study entry , follow 4000 IU/day rest study period ) comparator arm standard care plus placebo .</detailed_description>
