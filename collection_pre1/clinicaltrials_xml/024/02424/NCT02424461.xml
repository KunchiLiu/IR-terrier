	<brief_summary>This study investigate treatment urinary tract infection ( UTI ) men . The investigator look see short duration antibiotic ( 7 day ) inferior long duration antibiotic ( 14 day ) . The investigator also study whether long treatment lead increase antibiotic resistant bacteria gut microbiota increase drug side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic Treatment 7 Days Versus 14 Days Patients With Acute Male Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study multicentre , non-inferiority , double blind , randomize placebo-controlled trial treatment duration male urinary tract infection ( UTI ) due fluoroquinolones susceptible bacteria . Specifically , 284 men UTI randomize 7 vs. 14 day antimicrobial treatment . The primary outcome resolution fever , sterile urine analysis 4 week completion antimicrobial therapy antibiotic therapy active bacterial strain responsible UTI within 4 week period follow antimicrobial therapy . Secondary outcome include intestinal carriage antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacilli end treatment , incidence severity adverse drug event recurrent UTI within treatment period 4 week 12 week complete active study medication . Currently , optimal treatment duration male UTI unknown . Only one randomize study show difference outcome , patient treat ciprofloxacin 14 vs. 28 day . However , study underpowered included patient single center . Current treatment guideline consensual recommend treat men UTI 7 4 6 week . Shorter duration may expose patient recurrence long duration may associate increase Clostridium difficile infection antimicrobial resistance . Longer-duration treatment also costly inconvenient patient . Thus , since longer-duration treatment associate adverse outcome , order justify longer-duration treatment thee must clinically significant benefit extend treatment . The propose randomize placebo-controlled trial test hypothesis 7 day antimicrobial treatment non-inferior resolution fever microbiological success compare 14 day treatment .</detailed_description>
