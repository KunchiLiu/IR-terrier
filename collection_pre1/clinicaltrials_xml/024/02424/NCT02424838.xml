	<brief_summary>After patient screen sign informed consent , take endoscopy suite . Once decision make proceed FNA , subject randomize 1 4 group : - 22gauge ( G ) needle suction - 25G needle suction - 22G needle without suction - 25G needle without suction Follow-up Phone Call Phase : Unit staff call patient 1 week procedure check patient adverse event procedure record onto dataset .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>22 G - 25 G SINS Trial Pancreatic Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult patient refer Florida Hospital evaluation pancreatic mass lesion eligible entry study . Patients approach time procedural consent study . 1 . After write informed consent take , EUS perform conscious sedation . 2 . At time EUS , patient require FNA randomize two needle ( 22G 25G needle ) two technique ( use suction use suction ) . 3 . Computer-generated randomization assignment use block randomization method obtain statistician prior study enrollment . These place sequentially number seal opaque envelope open endoscopy nurse immediately decision perform FNA make . The randomization sequence specify needle size use whether suction apply FNA . 4 . FNA perform standard fashion use one designate needle size ( use fan technique pas needle 12-16 time lesion ) one experienced endosonographers unit . The needle stylet leave place first pas remove subsequent pass . Suction apply aspiration mass dictate randomization sequence . 5 . First two pass perform obtain tissue sample cell block analysis . Therefore , tissue obtain first second pass express onto slide test tube cell block analysis . 6 . From third pas onwards , aspirate obtain examine onsite cytopathologist , available interpret slide immediately determine diagnostic adequacy sample per standard practice . Once diagnosis make adequacy sample affirm cytopathologist , procedure stop echoendoscope withdrawn patient . 7 . Total number pass obtain diagnostic cytological aspirate make recorded time procedure , well occurrence needle dysfunction , technical failure , immediate complication . 8 . The sample take transported pathology lab ( per standard practice ) cellular aspirate cell block sample evaluate pathologist . 10 % sample subgroup ( i.e . 22G suction , 22G without suction , 25G suction , 25G without suction ) analyze presence molecular marker malignancy . 9 . After appropriate observation deem satisfactory , patient discharge per unit policy . 10 . Unit staff call patient 1 week procedure check patient adverse event procedure record onto dataset .</detailed_description>
