	<brief_summary>Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( neo-CRT ) increasingly applied curative treatment esophageal cancer , aim downstage tumor , increase rate radical resection , consequently improve survival rate . Due improve survival , become increasingly important minimize radiation-induced toxicity among long-term survivor . In management locally advance non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , radiotherapy standard treatment modality . However , dose safely apply tumour limit risk cardiac pulmonary complication , even lead decreased survival randomise study , high tumor dose administer [ 1 ] . Radiation induce pulmonary cardiac toxicity important late side effect thoracic radiotherapy [ 2-4 ] . The aim study reduce radiation dose heart ( lung ) order reduce toxicity risk . In recent year , active breathing control ( ABC ) technique introduce radiotherapy leave sided breast cancer patient , minimize radiation dose heart . These patient irradiate inspiration phase , distance heart breast large , lung extend . Breath hold might also beneficial radiotherapy esophageal lung tumor . For patient expiratory phase might theoretically beneficial reduce heart dose . However , inspiration phase might better dose lung , consequently allow cardiac dose reduction .</brief_summary>
