	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-935 . TAK-935 test examine degree duration brain CH24H enzyme occupancy/target engagement function TAK-935 plasma concentration order guide dose schedule future clinical trial TAK-935.This study utilize PET ligand [ 18F ] MNI-792 evaluate brain CH24H occupancy TAK-935 single dose oral administration healthy adult participant . The study evaluate 16 participant . The first 2 participant take TAK-935 600 mg oral solution undergo PET image use tracer [ 18F ] MNI-792 5 microgram ( 370 MBq ) , injection , intravenously prior PET scan Baseline , 45 minute 10 hour post-TAK-935 dose . TAK-935 dose time post-dose scan subsequent participant base data previous participant . This single-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 55 day . Participants make 4 visit clinic , include 2 confinement period clinic PET imaging . Participants contact phone Day 22 follow-up safety assessment .</detailed_description>
