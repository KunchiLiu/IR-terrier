	<brief_summary>The investigator aim serosurvey healthcare-personnel participate treatment confirmed patient Middle-East respiratory syndrome . The investigator collect base-line ( pre-exposure ) serum healthcare-personnel center , collect post-exposure serum 25-30 center confirm MERS patient treat . The investigator deduct seroprevalence MERS-CoV IgG among healthy healthcare-personnel , calculate sero-conversion rate possible .

	<detailed_description>We aim deduct seroprevalence healthcare-personnel ( HCP ) participate treatment confirmed patient Middle-East respiratory syndrome . In first step , collect base-line ( pre-exposure ) serum HCP work hospital confirm MERS patient treat . Pre-exposure serum collect center . If serum drawn within 3 week initial exposure , serum consider adequate pre-exposure . ( Because , antibody MERS-CoV would produce 17-21 day exposure ) . The serum frozen . In second step , collect post-exposure serum HCP work hospital confirm MERS patient treat detected . We plan include 25-30 center . The timing sample collection 6-8 week last contact confirm MERS patient . The serum also freeze . In third step , assay presence antibody collect sample . We use MERS-CoV ELISA kit ( EUROIMMUNE co. ) screen test MERS-CoV IFA kit ( EUROIMMUNE co. ) confirm test .</detailed_description>
