	<brief_title>Once Versus Twice Daily Electrolyte Monitoring CHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Over 5 million Americans currently suffer heart failure , result 1 million hospital admission year . Heart failure hospitalization one expensive medical problem face Americans today ] . Admissions acute decompensate heart failure exacerbation manage medically oral intravenous ( IV ) diuretic . Side effect diuretic well establish , common metabolic derangement , specifically alteration level potassium . Clinical manifestation hypokalemia hyperkalemia commonly muscle cramp clinically insignificant arrhythmia . The concern manifestation hypo hyperkalemia include symptomatic arrhythmia , myalgia , rarely rhabdomyolysis . Active use diuretic require monitor serum electrolytes prevent clinically significant derangement potassium . The frequency monitoring require prevent event establish . Monitoring thus provider dependent . At single large academic medical center monitoring frequency range 1-2 time daily average . In trial determine whether twice-daily electrolyte lab result less frequent clinically hypo hyperkalemia . We also investigate multitude outcome include potential cost saving reduce laboratory test ordering . Intervention : Randomization study population ONCE daily schedule BMP TWICE daily schedule BMP . Risk : Risks arm study clinical equipoise include : Hypokalemia , hyperkalemia , arrhythmia ( secondary hypokalemia hyperkalemia ) , delayed identification rise creatinine ( acute kidney injury ) . Project goal : Twice daily basic metabolic panel 's labs common practice Vanderbilt University Medical Center . However , unclear often second BMP day act . Our project aim answer fundamental question need twice daily labs patient hospitalize acute/subacute-decompensated congestive heart failure actively diuresed . Descriptive : Age Race Sex JVP admission JVP discharge Congestion CXR Left ventricular ejection fraction Diabetes ( Type I , Type II [ define HgA1C &gt; 6.5 % ] ) Type cardiomyopathy- ICM v NON Ace-I ARB Beta blocker Aldosterone antagonist HF hospitalization within past 12 month Na K ( record stay ) Cl BUN Cr ( record stay recent prior hospitalization ) Total dose loop diuretic receive admission Total dose thiazide diuretic receive Total dose mineralocorticoid antagonist receive Outcomes : Primary : Proportion lab spent ideal potassium range ( define 3.5-5.0 mmol ) . Secondary : Clinically relevant hypokalemia hyperkalemia ; define new muscle weakness , rhabdomyolysis , paralysis , ECG change conduction . Amount potassium give , number time per day potassium give average potassium value stay . Time free readmission , length stay , change weight ( surrogate amount diuresis ) , Input output , mortality 1mo 3mo , cost saving admission .</detailed_description>
