	<detailed_description>STUDY AIMS Aim 1 : Assess rate uptake VMMC service men age 25-39 year expose Inter-Personal Communication ( IPC ) v . Designated ( old men ) Service Outlets ( DSO ) vs. IPC DSO intervention combine vs. intervention . Aim 2 : Determine test unlinked de-identified blood bleeding vessel surgical wound , proportion men whose HIV status unknown HIV infect ( Sub-study 1 ) . Aim 3 : Determine cost provide VMMC among three intervention relative intervention . MAIN STUDY DESIGN : We propose conduct cluster randomized-controlled trial , Locations form unit randomization . Within select Locations , shall randomly select approximately 16 % ( 209 ) village sufficient generate require sample size . Sample size Determination : Sample size detect impact intervention VMMC uptake - order able demonstrate least 33.3 % increase rate VMMC among young adult men intervention arm compare control arm 80 % statistical power , Bonferroni adjust two-sided Î±= ( 0.05/3 ) =0.017 follow implementation study intervention , need sample size 4,932 men reach intervention . Potential participant reach - An effect size equal 33.3 % increase MC 30 % 40 % require 1233 participant per study arm ( total 4932 ) , effect size equal 50 % increase VMMC 30 % 45 % require 573 participant per study arm ( total 2292 ) . Adjusting refusal rate 15 % loss follow 15 % , suggest contact 1603 per study arm result total 6412 uncircumcised men age 25-39 year . PHASE 1 : HOUSEHOLD ENUMERATION To ascertain size eligible population ( uncircumcised men age 25-39 year ) , conduct complete household listing select village enumerate male member household age 25-39 year . During exercise , shall physically visit home study village assign unique identification number every household ( HIN ) . Enumeration shall home visit ONLY mean . The unique HIN assign enumeration enter Excel database household men age 25-39 year sort put separate list . The list use create database eligible men village . Determining number household eligible men help know denominator planning recruitment . PHASE 2 : CONDUCTING RAPID FORMATIVE STUDY ( Sub-study 1 ) Justification : This phase intend provide information use delivering intervention . We already draft message base exist literature use IPC IPC+DSO intervention Locations/villages . However , since almost available information barrier facilitator VMMC literature collect among men age disaggregated age group , assume automatically relevant old men . As , still necessary conduct rapid formative study explore reason old men age 25-39 year go go VMMC service . Information obtain phase use modify , indicate , message develop exist literature . SUB-STUDY DESIGN : This phase shall comprise Focus Group Discussions ( FGDs ) In-Depth Interviews . Twelve FGDs , 6-10 participant , hold six group circumcise men six group uncircumcised men follow age category : 25-29 year , 30-34 year 35-39 year . A similarly number FGDs hold female partner circumcise female partner uncircumcised men age category . Besides FGDs , conduct 48 IDIs capture confidential information men woman would otherwise divulge FGD setting . PHASE 3 : ESTABLISHING BASELINE VMMC PREVALENCE AND PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE MEN Based eligible participant ' list , research assistant go back household men age 25 39 year . Before administer enrollment consent , RAs ask participant identify private location within outside house consent interview . The RA administer consent participate study , enroll consent participant assign Participant Unique ID number . After assign participant unique ID number , RA conduct baseline interview , verify MC status inform participant intervention arm deliver intervention participant available ( , another visit make later date deliver intervention ) . During interview , document participant ' circumcision status verbal report . After interview , participant consent physical verification ask choose perform . At enrollment , participant give 3 month within go circumcision , Participants go whenever want VMMC , study capture data go within 3 month . They also inform reminder expiry date circumcision send text message participant one month expiry circumcision window period . Details participant enrol study enter excel Master Log contain participant detail ; 3 name , ID number , age , location , village , telephone number participant close friend date enrollment . PHASE 4 : IMPLEMENTING THE INTERVENTIONS The study four intervention arm : Inter-Personal Communications ( IPC ) , Dedicated Service Outlets ( DSOs ) , combination IPC DSO ( IPC+DSO ) , Control . The intervention implement described 'Protocol arm intervention ' section . HIV TESTING OF PARTICIPANTS WITH UNKNOWN HIV STATUS ( Sub-study 2 ) In VMMC program Kenyan program well , 10 % 30 % men decline HIV test . Given VMMC offer principally HIV prevention strategy , important determine HIV status decline testing , prevalence significantly high accept testing , need design approach improve uptake testing . This particularly important follow result recently conclude study indicate 44 % HIV-infected men resume sex recommend 6 week sexual abstinence . Sample size HIV prevalence among uncircumcised men whose HIV status unknown ( Sub-study 2 ) : We estimate need test randomly select unlinked blood sample 163 men per arm whose HIV status unknown order estimate HIV prevalence fall within 10 % point true population prevalence 95 % confidence . Our study staff collect sample men refuse test consent Unlinked HIV test . With refusal rate 23.6 % voluntary HIV testing , consent rate 60 % , rate get man refuse test consent test unlinked blood sample bleeding vessel 14.2 % . In word , 4932 participant main study expect 1164 ( 4932*0.236 ) refuse HIV testing . With assumed unlinked HIV test acceptance rate 60 % , obtain 700 men sample size 4932 main study . For design effect 2.5 , use sample size 700 sub-study enable u estimate HIV prevalence 21.6 % precision 4.8 % =sqrt [ ( 2.5*1.96^2*.216*.784 ) /700 ] . Methods/Procedure : We perform unlinked test blood bleeding vessel finger prick whose HIV status unknown . While call proposal recommend test blood excise foreskin , concerned may able harvest sufficient blood foreskin perform test . This forceps-guided method use Kenya crush foreskin compress blood vessel supply distal section . This result little bleed excised foreskin . We therefore propose collect blood sample bleed vessel finger prick participant ( n=700 ) . COSTING VMMC IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERVENTIONS ( SUB-STUDY 3 ) Study Design : Data costing collect across study arm . Whereas economic evaluation service delivery conduct several context limit information cost-effectiveness various approach use recruitment increase service uptake . We plan assess cost-effectiveness demand creation VMMC service base three intervention . The result demonstrate accrued cost net saving associate intervention strategy . Methods : The primary outcome main study incremental change circumcision perform attributable respective demand creation intervention . Costs estimate primary outcome reference control group , continue provide routine recruitment approach . This demonstrate cost vary depend mode demand creation . We shall adopt societal perspective ability integrate diverse factor model role public sector play HIV prevention management . This approach incorporate cost borne implementers recruit participant service . Sources cost data : We collect data study sit use tool adapt Male Circumcision Decision-Makers ' Program Planning Tool ( DMPPT ) demand creation strategy . The DMPPT develop USAID/Health Policy Initiative collaboration UNAIDS enable decision-makers understand potential cost impact various option scale male circumcision service . The DMPPT previously use undertake cost male circumcision service East Central Africa . We shall use instrument data collection tool estimate cost demand creation unit cost provide VMMC ( i.e . cost per adult circumcise ) four study arm . PHASE 5 : ESTABLISHING ENDLINE MC PREVALENCE/ESTIMATING IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS At Endline , review Participant Master Log identify go VMMC 45 VMMC clinic participate study . We use telephone number obtain enrollment contact participant . Those say got circumcise Participant Master Log , make appointment visit home , another convenient location , administer consent , conduct Endline interview verify circumcision status . Those report go VMMC ask go , response record .</detailed_description>
