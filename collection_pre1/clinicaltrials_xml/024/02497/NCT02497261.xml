	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine avoidance peanut child positive allergy test peanut first 5 year life increase likelihood develop persistent peanut allergy age 5 year . To answer question , investigator need determine child positive allergy test peanut reaction eat peanut ( allergic peanut ) able tolerate eat peanut ( allergic ) . The investigator plan conduct double-blind placebo-controlled peanut challenge ( gold standard peanut allergy diagnosis ) CHILD study ( http : //www.canadianchildstudy.ca ) participant positive skin prick test peanut age 1 , 3 5 year ( word , child sensitize peanut , may may allergic peanut ) avoid peanut without ever reaction whose history suggest may outgrow know peanut allergy . These challenge change child 's ability tolerate peanut , determine child avoid peanut allergic peanut ( need continue avoid peanut ) clinically tolerant peanut ( may continue eat peanut passing challenge ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Food allergy reach epidemic level Canada peanut allergy prevalent one persistent food allergy among Canadian child adult . Avoidance late introduction peanut propose possible cause increase rate peanut sensitization allergy . Although delay introduction peanut child 's diet longer recommend , many parent continue worry introduce peanut introduce peanut child 's diet without negative skin prick test peanut . However , child never reaction peanut eat tolerate peanut despite sensitize ( positive skin prick test ) peanut . The purpose study determine avoidance peanut child positive skin prick test peanut first 5 year life increase likelihood develop persistent peanut allergy age 5 year . To answer question , investigator need determine child positive skin prick test peanut reaction eat peanut ( allergic peanut ) able tolerate eat peanut ( allergic ) . Specific Objectives : 1 . To conduct double-blind placebo-controlled peanut challenge among 5-year-old child sensitize avoid peanut , determine allergic peanut ( need continue avoid peanut ) clinically tolerant peanut ( may continue eat peanut passing challenge ) 2 . To determine relative risk develop peanut allergy among peanut-sensitized child eat versus avoid peanut . Challenge Procedure : Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge gold standard clinical practice diagnosis food allergy , involve child undergo separate challenge food placebo child , parent , physician nurse administer challenge mask regard challenge food placebo . All child undergo challenge peanut placebo , randomize order . These challenge change child 's ability tolerate peanut , determine child avoid peanut allergic peanut ( need continue avoid peanut ) clinically tolerant peanut ( may continue eat peanut passing challenge ) . The challenge conduct clinical unit set food challenge , research nurse pediatric allergist expertise experience manage food allergy oral food challenge . Each child undergo challenge peanut one day challenge placebo another day . The peanut conceal vehicle , shake smoothie . One challenge contain peanut conceal vehicle challenge contain vehicle . The challenge food prepare team member otherwise involved challenge . A study worker involve challenge also charge randomize two challenge peanut placebo decoding challenge food identity challenge complete . The child , family , research nurse pediatric allergist know whether challenge food contains peanut placebo challenge complete . This procedure help distinguish symptom occur due anxiety ( equally likely occur peanut placebo challenge ) reaction peanut ( occur peanut challenge ) . Children develop symptom anaphylaxis ( e.g . hive , swell , trouble breathing , vomit , abdominal pain change level consciousness ) challenge 2-hour observation period challenge pass challenge consider clinically tolerant ; encourage continue eat peanut home least per week . Children develop symptom challenge contain peanut consider allergic , especially symptoms occur challenge contain vehicle .</detailed_description>
