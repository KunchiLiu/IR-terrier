	<brief_summary>â€¢ The goal study evaluate safety efficacy autologous MSC application therapy drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy . Adult ( 18-60 year old ) patient ( pt ) sex suffer refractory epilepsy frequent ( &gt; 5 event per month ) seizures include study . The pt randomize standard treatment anti-epileptic drug ( control group , 30 pt ) anti-epileptic drug plus autologous mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) ( study group , 30 pt ) . The pt study group receive one intravenous injection ex vivo expand MSCs ( 40-101 x 106 cell ) one subsequent endolumbal injection neuroinduced MSCs ( 2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cell ) . Both unfavorable reaction MSC infusion clinical effect , include complication , examine . The unfavorable reaction MSC injection include local pain hemorrhage site injection systemic reaction central nervous system ( CNS ; i.e. , hyperthermia , fatigue , myalgia ) .The possible beneficial effect therapy two group pt examine base clinical observation electroencephalography measurement ( prior 12 month application MSC-based therapy ) . To determine potential change disease progression , sign cognitive impairment , behavioral disorder , particularly , change seizure character frequency evaluate use National Hospital Scale Seizure Severity . The main point disease monitor `` yes '' `` '' response ( therapy ) , seizure frequency ( per month ) , remission disease . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) recording perform evaluate electrical alpha , beta , theta delta wave base standard additional criterion . The paroxismality index , peak frequency EEG activity , index slow activity , summarize point EEG pathology sign calculate patient . All assessment perform pt control study group , obtain data compare identify potential difference two pt group . Therapy terminate immediate unfavorable reaction MSC injection observe . The final observation patient include clinical EEG assessment time point 12 month ( ) application MSC-based therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal phase 1 clinical trial evaluate safety autologous mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) application therapy drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy one-center study . It well know drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy dramatically invalidate disorder apply stationary outpatient therapy real clinical effect . Therefore new approach need reach remission , stop disease progression , increase patient quality life . For study , adult ( 18-60 year old ) patient ( pt ) sex suffer drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy frequent ( &gt; 5 event per month ) seizures include study . Drug-resistance define lack evident clinical response ( i.e. , decrease seizure frequency reduction disease progression ) pts symptomatic epilepsy carbamazepine , valproic acid , topiramate , lamotrigine , phenobarbital ( i.e. , anti-epileptic drug [ AEDs ] ) monotherapies different combination previous one calendar year . The criteria exclusion patient refusal participate , unfavorable reaction therapy , CNS inflammatory condition , chronic psychosis , CNS tumor , relapse chronic somatic neurologic disease , blood positivity hepatitis B C HIV . The plan include inclusion 30 pt study group 30 pt control group period 5 year . The pt randomize standard treatment AEDs ( control group ) AEDs plus autologous mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs , study group ) . The MSCs obtain bone marrow sample patient purify expanded ex vivo specialize cellular biotechnology laboratory . The MSCs characterize immunophenotyping CD90+CD105 +CD45-CD34-cells . After 3 week cultivation vitro , portion MSC additionally culture 7 day Neurocult-XF proliferation medium obtain neuroinduced MSCs . Neuroinduction prove presence genetic marker nestin neuron-specific enolase . Finally , 40-101 x 106 autologous culture MSCs 2.7 - 8.0 x 106 autologous neuroinduced MSCs harvest , resuspend saline solution contain 5 % autologous blood serum injection , , follow measurement viability ( 98 % cell ) , transfer clinical center . The pt study group receive one slowly deliver ( 5-10 minute ) intravenous injection ex vivo expand autologous MSCs volume 20 ml , 5-7 day later , patient study group receive additional slowly deliver endolumbal injection neuroinduced MSCs volume 5 ml . Both unfavorable reaction MSC injection ( one day follow performance procedure ) early ( one month ) late ( 6 month ) clinical effect , include complication , evaluate . Unfavorable reaction MSC injection include local pain hemorrhage site injection systemic reaction central nervous system ( CNS , i.e. , hyperthermia , fatigue , myalgia ) . Later potential unfavorable systemic reaction CNS vascular system , include infectious noninfectious complication progression disease control , examine . All event document medical card . In case event exhibit dangerous characteristic , declare member monitor board ( center 's ethical committee ) evaluation exclusion patient study termination clinical study . Also evaluate possible beneficial effect MSC-based therapy pt study group . These effect detect via clinical observation select therapy time point ( i.e. , 3 12 month application MSC-based therapy ) electroencephalography measurement prior one year therapy . To determine possible change disease progression , sign cognitive impairment , behavioral disorder , change seizure characteristic frequency evaluate . For evaluation cognitive impairment , use Mini-Mental State Examination . The handicap effect disease daily life score use Subjective Handicap Epilepsy Scale . State anxiety depression evaluate use Hospital anxiety depression scale . Changes seizure characteristic frequency evaluate use National Hospital Scale Seizure Severity . The process voluntary attention performance study Schulte table accord method Kraepelin . Schulte table use study sensorimotor reaction time distribution stability attention . The `` Account Kraepelin '' method use study health , fatigue stability attention . The assessment short-term memory perform via method memorize 10 word ; method aim determine volume speed oral-aural memory . Main clinical characteristic use disease monitoring `` yes '' `` '' response ( regard therapy ) , seizure frequency ( per month ) , remission disease early ( 3 month ) late ( 12 month ) time point therapy . To evaluate partial response therapy , number pts exhibit 50 % reduction seizure frequency assess . Seizure type ( i.e. , generalize tonic-clonic , partial complex , simple partial , multiple type seizure ) also evaluate along change seizure type treatment course . Electroencephalography recording perform admission across monitoring period use Mizar EEG 201 encephalography system biopotential registration 16 body point accord `` 10-20 '' scheme . The observed electrical alpha , beta , theta delta wave analyze 3-min segment ( recalculation 1-minute segment ) prior ( admission ) 1 year MSC application . The peak frequency alpha wave also calculate . Both spontaneous state state loading probe ( hyperventilation photostimulation ) evaluate patient . The characteristic electroencephalographies ( EEG ) attribute local diffuse cortical alteration . We evaluate paroxysmality index , quantities local generalized spike epileptiform wave per minute , peak frequency EEG activity , index slow activity , summarize point EEG pathology sign . EEGs epileptiform activity include spike , spike-slow wave , high-amplitude spike . The EEG recording perform base standard additionally propose criterion . All assessment perform pt control study group , obtain data compare determine potential difference due additionally perform MSC-based therapy . A patient 's therapy terminate time point immediate unfavorable reaction MSC injection observe . The final observation patient include clinical EEG assessment 12 month ( ) application MSC-based therapy . The summarized data pt control study group collect electronic database analysis interpretation .</detailed_description>
