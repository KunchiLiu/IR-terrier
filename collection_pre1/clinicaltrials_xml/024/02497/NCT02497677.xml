	<detailed_description>Background rationale Infant mental health significant public health issue early adversity exposure early childhood stress life-long consequence affect child outcomes physical mental health , educational attainment , labor market success family formation . Infants - result dependency , vulnerability relative social invisibility - expose mental health risk old child . Infants may risk due particular biological risk ( e.g . infantile autism , retardation , prematurity , physical disability etc ) psycho-social risk family ( e.g . mentally ill parent , poverty , drug/alcohol abuse etc ) . Recent Danish estimate suggest one five family risk inadequate parent resource child neglect . There solid evidence establishment attachment relationship , i.e . stable emotional bond caregiver - mostly parent - one important developmental milestone infancy . Early parent-child attachment relationship function blueprint future social relationship serve framework within child learn deal stressful situation regulate accompany negative emotion . Insecure disorganize attachment significant risk longitudinal child development psychopathology , ability regulate one feeling stress negative emotion important wide range socio-emotional outcome range social competence , moral development empathy , academic achievement . Recent meta-analyses show insecure disorganize child higher risk develop mental problem later life . Insecurely attached child also likely securely attached child develop internalize problem , anxiety depressive symptom , well externalize problem aggressive behavior . For externalize problem , risk even high disorganized child . Furthermore , research early brain development indicate brain development physiologically alter severe stress impose neglect inadequate parenting child 's early year . Evidence attachment research show sensitive parenting , parent alert able understand infant 's expression emotional state able manage meet infant 's need contingently , adequately comfort way lead establishment pattern secure attachment child . Lack availability , inconsistent availability , misunderstand infant 's emotional expression parental behavior frightens infant may lead insure attachment severe case disorganize attachment . This indicative breakdown organize ( secure insecure ) attachment behavioral strategy . Disorganized attachment consider result parental behavior frighten child . An extreme example behavior child maltreatment , sort parental behavior comprehensible child , dissociation , common depress parent , potentially frighten child . This sort behavior result paradoxical situation parent source comfort source fear time . Thus , stress situation child know , behavioral strategy collapse . Infant social withdrawal indicate infant distress early attachment disturbance know risk factor infant mental health . Infant social withdrawal indicate lack either positive ( e.g . smiling , eye contact ) negative vocal protestation . Sustained withdrawal behavior infant see chronic diminution attachment system , gradually generalize diminish engagement lower reactivity environment large . In European country use validated systematic screening method , Alarm Distress Baby Scale ( ADBB ) identify infant delay socio-emotional development infant mental health clinic home visit program show promising result . Postnatal depression ( PND ) another know risk infant mental health . A meta-analysis show 19 % new mother may experience minor major depression first month postpartum . If include major depression , prevalence find 7.1 % . In recent European study , 1,066 woman follow pregnancy 12 month postpartum . The result indicate 9.6 % new mother may experience major depressive episode first year delivery . No estimate give minor depression . Most case develop within first three month peak incidence 4-6 week . PND substantial impact mother , partner , family , mother-baby interaction attachment insecurity long term socio-emotional cognitive development baby , especially depression occurs first year life . Often , mother suffer postnatal depression emotionally , cognitively and/or behaviorally inhibit impaired ability recognize react appropriate `` sensitivity '' `` responsiveness '' child 's need . With regard infant mother , high incidence negative behavior , social withdrawal , persistent cry , avert gaze head position , physical neediness lack expression delight presence mother , observe . These behavior increase mother 's experience stress , contribute maintenance maladaptive interactional behavioral pattern . Without improvement negative interaction cycle , example , early intervention , great likelihood infant develop insecure-avoidant , insecure ambivalent disorganize attachment pattern . Research treatment woman postnatal depression show treatment focus mother ( i.e. , medication , psychotherapy ) insufficient buffer negative impact maternal psychopathology child 's cognitive psychosocial development , well infant-mother attachment quality . Even depression effectively treat , seem `` spill '' improve mother-infant relationship long-term infant social-emotional outcome . Instead , necessary support depress mother specific need care relating infant , Interventions target PND deliver group find achieve change dual process emotional experience reflection interpersonal context . Group sessions provide support network , reduce isolation stigma , provide environment practice interpersonal communication skill , shape cop strategy learn , enable number family treat . Recently , build evidence attachment research , special focus give preventive group program enhance parental sensitivity secure attachment intervention program `` Circle Security ( COS ) '' . Based finding study , COS prove efficient enhance secure attachment well reduce maternal depressive symptomatology high-risk sample , include mother prison mentally ill mother . The original COS program consist 20 weekly session 2 hour duration include initial video assessment parent -child attachment . In COS intervention graphical illustration `` Circle Security '' use . This Circle roadmap encompasses three basic control system ; attachment system , exploration system caregiving system . The parent illustrate pair hand hold together child 's world . In COS concept , `` hold '' mean serve secure base safe . `` The top half '' Circle depict child 's exploration system need . I order explore , child need parent serve secure base `` watching , '' `` delighting , '' `` help , '' `` enjoy '' child . Having parent support exploration help child develop sense interest , lead mastery competency later year . Along `` bottom half '' child 's attachment need : `` protect , '' `` comfort , '' `` delight , '' `` organize feeling . '' By delight child , parent help child construct internal representation him- love person thereby establish self-worth , organize child 's feeling accept , share naming , parent co-regulates child 's emotion lay groundwork later self-regulation emotion . The child 's need comfort exploration encouragement shift rapidly caregiver must continuously adjust need , whenever possible . Meta-analytic evidence identifies short term group approach ( &lt; 16 session ) , target maternal sensitivity effective , sensitivity focus intervention conduct refer at-risk sample ( e.g . DSM-III-R depressed mother ) , effective intervention group . Attachment security , particular , find readily influence sensitivity-focused intervention . The program `` Circle Security Parenting '' ( COS-P ) recent short version COS consist eight weekly session two hour duration without individual video assessment attachment . In COS-P standard video material child attachment behavior well graphic material illustrate Circle Security use . Themes covered program : `` The Circle Security '' , `` Exploration child 's need circle '' , `` Being child circle '' , `` Exploration challenge meet child 's need '' , `` Disruption repair relationship '' . To best investigator 's knowledge , effectiveness COS-P relation enhance maternal sensitivity mother-infant relationship fully test RCT design general population , make study first . Results provide evidence regard efficacy American short term indicate parent group program implement Scandinavian country . Further , COS-P promise approach health nurse train COS-P therapist future up-scaling .</detailed_description>
