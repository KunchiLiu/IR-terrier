	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The common complication endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis . Precut sphincterotomy regard risk factor . However , early precut may actually reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis risk . However , early precut preventive measure compare preventive measure , pancreatic duct stent placement . AIM : To compare efficacy early precut sphincterotomy versus pancreatic duct stent placement high-risk subject undergoing ERCP . MATERIALS AND METHODS : This single-blinded , randomized trial take place two tertiary referral center Buenos Aires . ERCP subject shall present least one follow risk factor : female sex , age le 40 year , clinical suspicion Sphincter Oddi dysfunction , previous pancreatitis , common bile duct diameter le 8 mm . Only present difficult biliary cannulation shall randomize two group : receive early precut sphincterotomy persistency biliary cannulation intend subsequent pancreatic duct stent placement cholangiography achieve . The incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis well complication shall compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Precut Versus Pancreatic Stent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well know pancreatitis common dreadful complication endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Historically , precut sphincterotomy regard risk factor post-ERCP pancreatitis . However , evidence suggest use early point procedure , may actually behave protective factor . In high risk patient , patient sphincter Oddi dysfunction , pancreatic duct stent placement consider prophylactic measure pancreatitis . However , pancreatic duct stent placement sometimes cumbersome procedure , may require additional procedure ( mainly spontaneous stent dislodgment accomplish ) . There evidence compare early precut versus pancreatic duct stent placement high-risk patient . As consequence , aim study compare efficacy early precut sphincterotomy versus pancreatic duct stent placement patient present least one risk factor post-ERCP pancreatitis difficult biliary cannulation . A single-blinded , randomized trial undertaken . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion present difficult biliary cannulation ERCP randomize early precut persistence biliary cannulation sphincterotome posterior pancreatic duct stent placement . The incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis well complication compare group .</detailed_description>
