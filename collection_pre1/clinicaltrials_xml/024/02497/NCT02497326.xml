	<detailed_description>Second degree partial thickness burn ( PTB ) tricky variety identify treat , four category burn ( base depth ) . It divide superficial deep partial thickness base depth dermal injury . ( 1 ) Clinical criterion fulfil point category i.e . Superficial PTB ( SPTB ) reddish pink , bleed briskly ( &lt; 3sec ) pin prick , blanch brisk return ( &lt; 2 sec ) pressure , blister formation Deep PTB ( DPTB ) mottle pink , delay bleeding ( &gt; 3 sec ) pin prick , slow return ( &gt; 2 sec ) pressure , blister , commonly used differentiate sub-classes . Pain hallmark 2nd degree burn treat topical IV analgesic . Topical conventional treatment superficial PTB wound include application polyfax skin ointment plus lignocain gel twice day wound wash deep PTB treat silvazine cream twice day prepare graft normal saline dressing , heal within 3 week . Current treatment 2nd degree burn complex , uncomfortable patient expensive health system ( 2,3 ) . Search continue reliable , safe , cheap effective treatment burn . Heparin use topically burn patient protocol topical heparin use introduce . It believe heparin help reduce pain associate burn duration wound heal . ( 4 ) It note mechanism involve heparin 's action burn probably derive anti-inflammatory angiogenic property , stimulate tissue repair re-epithelializing effect . ( 2 ) These action depend well-known anticoagulant action . Burn analgesia heparin cause inhibition pro-inflammatory product act free nerve ending cause pain . In regard , isolated case report continue emerge , suggest heparin able promote tissue repair inhibit inflammation burn patient . ( 5 ) It show study total 58 patient , topical Heparin group demand less analgesic medication mg/day ( 11.83 ± 9.38 ) Control group ( 33.35± 20.63 ) . It report another study heparin apply topically 5 day 50 pediatric patient reduce healing time . ( 6 ) Indeed number report heparin use , topically systemically lack effectively control study area clear conclusion draw efficacy approach . ( 7 ) As note already exist conventional therapy un-comfortable expensive patient , use heparin topically burn patient easy perform cheap moment , evidence effectiveness weak . So rationale study verify clinical effectiveness use heparin 2nd degree burn . Objective : - To compare conventional treatment topical heparin treatment 2nd degree burn patient term total consumption analgesic medication duration wound healing .</detailed_description>
