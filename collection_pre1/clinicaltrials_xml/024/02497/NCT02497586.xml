	<brief_summary>Lung cancer commonly characterise either surgical procedure take tissue sample needle . Unfortunately , invasive approach may unsafe many patient lung cancer , often co-existing illness emphysema . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) type scan offer possibility assess tumour function measure concentration chemical ( metabolite ) within abnormal tissue . It well-established technique image brain cancer . It also recently study assess prostate , liver heart . There little exploration potential role MRS lung cancer . The propose feasibility study recruit 15 patient proven lung cancer undergo MRS scan . The reliability technique metabolite measurement determine compare repeat scan region tumour . Further scan different region tumour , normal lung around tumour tumour region different patient use look pattern cancer metabolite may indicate avenue potential future research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) application aim utilise lung cancer first time higher magnetic field strength ( 3 Tesla ) . MRS allow nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum obtain user-defined region interest ( ROIs ) within body tissue . These spectrum use quantify concentration tumour metabolite , provide unique biological information non-invasively without need ionise radiation intravenous contrast material . Proton MRS well-established technique characterisation brain pathology prostate cancer . MRS lung challenge move structure show feasible previous small study use basic standard field strength equipment technique . MRS move structure , namely heart liver , show achievable . It believe MRS , use high field strength ( 3 Tesla ) machine , applied evaluation lung cancer human subject . Successful utilisation technology quantify metabolite concentration within lung cancer offer new opportunity non-invasive tumour classification . For example , low tumour oxygen level , know prognostic indicator , may identifiable non-invasive measurement lactate concentration MRS . Since MRS easily repeatable technique without ionise radiation , may also prove useful response assessment follow lung cancer therapy . This prospective feasibility study , aim recruit 15 consecutive patient lung cancer undergo proton MRS . The feasibility repeatability technique assess analysis MR spectrum obtain . The principal research question : Can MRS scan obtain lung cancer high field strength ( 3 Tesla ) MR scanner ? The secondary research question : Is indication reproducibility MRS signal obtain ? Is indication MRS pattern correlate tumour type clinical parameter might useful subject investigation lung cancer characterisation ? Summary intervention : 1 . During attendance respiratory clinic , invite patient participate study issue Patient Information Sheet ( PIS ) , highlight contact detail next step ( typically 5 min ) 2 . Patients question may contact study investigator use telephone number PIS answer ( typically 5-15 min ) 3 . Patients wish proceed contact RIF use telephone number PIS arrange convenient scan appointment taxi transfer ( typically 5 min ) At least 1 day clinic attendance 4 . Written inform consent obtain , pre-scan checklist complete GP letter send medical member study team . Research radiographer complete safety checklist patient . Scan undertaken , maximum 'on table ' scan time 1 hour . Implications research future service development : If early study show MRS lung cancer technically feasible , investigator apply external funding large prospective study study correlate MRS finding panel clinical , image , histopathological molecular variable . These secondary study would potential alter clinical practice tumour characterisation follow-up . The overall aim research would development non-invasive tool enable diagnosis characterisation suspect lung cancer .</detailed_description>
