	<brief_title>Biomarkers Friedreich 's Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Friedreich 's ataxia ( FA ) autosomal recessive disease cause mutation frataxin gene ( FXN ) . Although rare , FA common form hereditary ataxia , affect 1 every 50,000 people United States . Currently , palliative therapy treatment FA patient . However , current gene therapy effort neuromuscular disease position investigator 's research program extend discovery technique FA . As new therapy become available clinical application , crucial identify non-invasive outcome measure cardiac neuromuscular performance adequate sensitivity detect impact treatment .</detailed_description>
