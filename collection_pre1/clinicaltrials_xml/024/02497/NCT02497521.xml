	<detailed_description>A substantial number ADPKD patient treat center refer center counseling consider eligible tolvaptan treatment , thus , invite enter registry . Furthermore , many patient ADPKD treat nephrologists practice . We operate network many practice expand network . Patients enrol - obtain approval local ethic committee - external site ( expect number : 500 patient per year ) .

Usually , patient refer institution evaluation counsel regularly see year . No additional trial-related visit institution require line observational nature trial . However , data record restricted parameter assess center include also parameter assess treat physician . SOPs include diagnostic test like MRI apply routinely ADPKD patient management institution .

The parameter list constitute core data set , additional parameter include consider essential . Clinical data : - demographic data ( sex , age , height , weight ) - family history - genotype ( available ) - extrarenal ADPKD manifestation - co-morbidities - medication - physical examination - blood pressure - . extrarenal renal complication past 12 month ( urinary tract infection , pain episode , macrohematuria , kidney stone , hospital admission , ... ) Laboratory parameter include primarily ( exclusively ) : - serum sodium - serum potassium - serum osmolality - serum creatinine - estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) - serum urea - serum uric acid - whole blood count - liver enzyme , bilirubin - urinary sodium ( spot 24h-urine ) - urinary potassium - urinary osmolality - urinary creatinine - urinary urea - urinary uric acid - urinary protein Imaging study parameter : - MRI - TKV - ultrasound - ( CT-scan available ) Registered patient provided diary documentation tolvaptan dose , adverse side effect etc . These diary collect yearly basis data include registry . Additionally patient ask fill questionnaire regard current medication , complication ADPKD etc . year well commercially available SF-12 ( quality life assessment ) form .
