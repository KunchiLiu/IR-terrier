	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Vedolizumab Intravenous ( IV ) Compared Adalimumab Subcutaneous ( SC ) Participants With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab . Vedolizumab test treat people ulcerative colitis . This study look stool frequency , rectal bleeding finding endoscopy people take vedolizumab compare take adalimumab . The study enroll approximately 658 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Vedolizumab 300 mg IV - Adalimumab 160 mg Day 1 follow 80 mg Week 2 40 mg every 2 week SC All participant receive 1 intravenous infusion Day 1 Weeks 2 , 6 , 14 , 22 , 30 , 38 , 46 . All participant also receive 4 SC injection Day 1 2 SC injection Days 1 2 , follow 2 SC injection 1 day Week 2 1 SC injection every 2 week Week 50 . All participant ask record symptom ulcerative colitis daily diary . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 79 week . Participants make approximately 11 visit clinic , contact telephone 6 month last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
