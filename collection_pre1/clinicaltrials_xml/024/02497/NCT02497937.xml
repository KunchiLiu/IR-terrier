	<brief_summary>This study single centre , randomise , double-blind , sponsor-unblinded , placebo-controlled , 2 2 crossover study adult heart failure . In block TRPV4 ion channel reduce pulmonary interstitial fluid , GSK2798745 may improve pulmonary function , respiration , gas exchange well sleep-disordered breathing patient heart failure . Therefore , current study design investigate effect repeat administration GSK2798745 pulmonary gas exchange pulmonary function . A sufficient number subject heart failure enrol 12 subject complete two study period critical assessment . Subjects randomise receive either GSK2798745 placebo daily period 7 day one treatment period alternate study medication second treatment period . Both treatment period separate washout period least 14-days . This study consist Screening visit within 14 day start Period I two treatment period wherein eligible subject randomise one two treatment sequence , follow-up visit approximately 2 week completion second study period . The total duration study approximately 8 week screen follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
