	<brief_title>Besifloxacin Bacterial Keratitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : patient bacterial keratitis treat besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension non inferior clinical outcome compare treat fortified antibiotic drop ( tobramycin cefazolin ) Bacterial keratitis serious ocular problem , appropriately treat , lead corneal scarring , perforation , endophthalmitis , ultimately blindness . Current accept treatment practitioner major academic center ( McGill University Department Ophthalmology ) corneal ulcer involve aggressive therapy fortify antibiotics1 , typically tobramycin ( gram negative coverage ) either vancomycin cefazolin ( gram positive and/or MRSA coverage ) . However , number problem treatment method . Patients must obtain fortified antibiotic specific pharmacy must compound preparation , increase cost patient potentially risk contamination . The regimen typically involve every hour , round clock dose least 48 hour , cause significant distress patient ( many eldery ) family , well compliance issue . Finally , fortify antibiotic toxic , retard epithelial healing rate , well conjunctival corneal toxic effect . The investigator ' overall goal determine whether besifloxacin ( less frequent dosing use fortified antibiotic ) use safely effectively treatment bacterial keratitis . Previous study examine effect bacterial conjunctivitis , investigator ' knowledge bacterial keratitis . However , clinician already use besifloxacin purpose , investigator wish examine safety efficacy . If investigator ' study show besifloxacin safe effective treatment bacterial keratitis , new treatment option bacterial keratitis may emerge . The investigator therefore plan conduct randomize , open label trial enrol patient newly diagnose previously treat bacterial keratitis . The patient randomize receive either besifloxacin 6 x daily initially , fortify antibiotic ( cefazolin tobramycin ) every hour . The investigator follow patient closely try evaluate whether besifloxacin effective treatment bacterial keratitis . This randomized , single-center , two-arm , open-label study compare novel therapy , besofloxacin ophthalmic suspension , traditional therapy fortify cefazolin tobramycin drop , treatment bacterial keratitis . Patients present bacterial keratitis McGill Ophthalmology Center 5252 Maissoneuve Montreal , offer opportunity resident staff physician call , enroll study , full discussion risk benefit detail . Referrals come outpatient clinic emergency department detail . The population patient expect outpatient , wide range age group &gt; 18 year old ( pediatrics study center see pediatric age patient ) . If patient choose enroll study , proceed receive standard treatment center . If patient choose enroll study , resident staff call , , consultation study investigator ( Dr Jean Deschenes ) , use pre-determined random number generator randomize patient A ) Besifloxacin arm , B ) Fortified Antibiotics arm . At first visit , complete anterior ophthalmological exam perform , along detailed ophthalmic medical history . Corneal scraping perform ( blood agar , chocolate agar , Sabaroud agar , slide mount gram stain ) . The participant prescribe either Besifloxacin Fortified Antibiotics ( Cefazolin Tobramycin ) depend randomization . The participant need take prescription outside pharmacy purchase cost medication . Suggested pharmacy make Fortified Antibiotics arm ( standard care due limit number pharmacy prepare compounded drop ) . Participants re-evaluated multiple time follow initial presentation . In arm medication taper accord clinical discretion treat physician . In besifloxacin arm , besifloxacin use . In fortified antibiotic arm , fortify drop taper may switch another standard care medication ( moxifloxacin drop ) bacterial keratitis improve per typical treatment regimen . Importantly , arm , treatment carry normal standard care bacterial keratitis . In besifloxacin arm , , visit day 8 , previous corneal bacterial culture remain positive , patient cross fortified antibiotic arm . Otherwise , crossover may occur significant clinical deterioration treat physician require urgent intervention . The expected duration subject participation 4 month . Study enrollment expect last 4 month well .</detailed_description>
