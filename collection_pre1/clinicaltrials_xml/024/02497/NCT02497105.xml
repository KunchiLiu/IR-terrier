	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet Program Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According evidence-based guideline diagnosis management epilepsy National Institute Clinical Excellence ( 2012 ) , ketogenic diet may consider adjunctive treatment child drug-resistant epilepsy . Vast anecdotal Class 1 study confirm ketogenic diet help child intractable seizure cure many . Dietary therapy epilepsy ( e.g. , classic ketogenic diet ) show highly effective . For example , Lee ( P.R . ) Kossoff report approximately 50 % child drug-resistant epilepsy great 50 % reduction seizure within day month treatment . In addition , use ketogenic diet treatment epilepsy show reduce escalate cost associate manage poorly control seizure ( e.g. , decrease outpatient emergency visit , inpatient hospitalization , neuroimaging , electro-encephalography , lab testing , medication use ) . If child 's seizure continue two three seizure medication try , ketogenic diet consider . However , many parent still medicate child well beyond guideline tolerate seizure frequency alternative . Given physical emotional toll recur seizure exact upon children/families , potential improvement ketogenic diet substantial . However , ketogenic diet remain unavailable child . Approximately 1 % Hawaii 's child project epilepsy , establish , ketogenic diet program receive dietary intervention , incorporate culturally distinct food improve palatability compliance . Although ketogenic diet show promise broaden scope therapeutic option child epilepsy , require study ethnically diverse population . At Shriners Hospitals Children-Honolulu , investigator initiate ketogenic related dietary ( e.g. , modified Atkins diet ) intervention program child epilepsy start assess efficacy treat epilepsy/seizures . This program also include educational seminar service patient reside Hawaii island outreach trip . The investigator begin enroll child epilepsy two group base whether receive ketogenic diet - epilepsy/ketogenic diet epilepsy/non-ketogenic diet ; total estimate 15-30 participant three year . Based upon initial finding , investigator implement comprehensive , multidisciplinary ketogenic diet program potentially reach hundred child throughout Hawaii , Pacific Basin , elsewhere . Specific Aims : Aim 1 . To assess therapeutic efficacy ketogenic diet epilepsy/seizures . Hypothesis : Participants epilepsy/on ketogenic diet significantly decrease number severity seizures ketogenic diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . Aim 2 . In anticipation lessen epilepsy/seizures , determine ( ) change number dose seizure medication use , ( b ) change number lab test order epilepsy management , ( c ) change number emergency room hospital visit seizure ( neurodevelopmental problem ) , ( ) change number neurologic procedure epilepsy management ( e.g . EEG , MRI , CT ) , ( e ) participant/family satisfaction ketogenic diet . Hypothesis : The number and/or dosage medication , lab test order , emergency room hospital visit , neurologic procedure epilepsy management decrease , participant/family satisfaction high participant epilepsy/on ketogenic diet ketogenic diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . Aim 3 . To compare difference and/or change ( ) serum urine ketone level ( b ) biochemical profile define blood stool ( gut fecal microbiome ) specimen sample . Hypothesis : Participants epilepsy/on ketogenic diet significantly high serum/urine ketone level notably different biochemical profile ketogenic diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . Children help ketogenic diet likely reach high level function become contributing adult . By provide ketogenic diet intervention therapy epilepsy safe data-driven manner , community-at-large benefit medical knowledge concern dietary treatment neurodevelopmental disorder advance .</detailed_description>
