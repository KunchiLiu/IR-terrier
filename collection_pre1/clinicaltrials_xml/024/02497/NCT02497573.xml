	<brief_title>Can DW MRI Predict Outcome During Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Around 1000 patient new cancer head neck ( H &amp; N ) register Scotland annually . Approximately 60 % manage west Scotland . Unfortunately large proportion , around 60 % , H &amp; N cancer present locally advanced non-metastatic disease . These associated poor outcome 3 year survival around 50 % . Despite intensive radical therapy associate significant acute toxicity , high recurrence rate ( 50 % ) unlike many cancer , vast majority recurrence , around 80 % , occur locally many patient go die local disease without develop distant metastasis . Locally recurrent tumour cause significant morbidity palliation difficult . There therefore clear need improve local disease control , increase cure rate improve quality life . This study design assess value DW MRI predictive biomarker intermediate high risk OPSCC . DW MRI change ADC show correlate response treatment prospective retrospective study SCC H &amp; N . These study include H &amp; N sub-sites differentiation biological sub-types . This study may therefore validate use DW MRI predictive biomarker specifically intermediate high risk group OPSCC . If change ADC RT find predictive eventual clinical outcome discriminatory threshold rise ADC identify , information could use inform treatment intensification patient respond poorly RT . This would form basis subsequent clinical trial . The hypothesis study quantitative DW MRI - i.e . change ADC RT - predictive locoregional control intermediate high risk OPSCC threshold identify ADC change discriminate responder non-responders radiotherapy . The design single centre observational study ass value DW MRI predictive biomarker HPV-OPSCC . 2 DW MRI scan carry participant addition standard imaging procedure radiotherapy . The information gain MRI scan use change standard treatment patient . DW MRI_1 obtain prior radiotherapy commence . DW MRI_2 carry third week radiotherapy treatment . The DW MRI scan use measure ADC calculate change ADC 2 scan . The MRI scan carry routine hospital visit radiotherapy plan treatment therefore involve extra visit participant . After completion ( chemo ) radiotherapy , patient attend Beatson WoSCC follow visit per standard protocol 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month post treatment . Information regard recurrence collect routine visit . No extra post-treatment visit therefore required participant . The recruitment phase estimate last 2 year patient follow 18 month completion radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
