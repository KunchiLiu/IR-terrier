	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Pharmacokinetics Efficacy Ceftazidime Avibactam ( CAZ-AVI ) Compared With Cefepime Children From 3 Months Less Than 18 Years Age With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections ( cUTIs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-blind , randomise , multi-centre , active control trial . Patients age 3 month le 18 year complicate urinary tract infection ( cUTIs ) randomise 1 2 treatment group ( 3:1 ratio ) : Ceftazidime avibactam ( CAZ AVI ) cefepime . Randomisation stratify age cohort . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) treatment minimum 72 hour ( 3 full day , ie , 9 dos give 3 time daily , 6 dos give twice daily ) option switch oral therapy . The decision switch oral therapy entirely Investigator 's discretion , patient good sufficient clinical response , patient tolerate oral fluid food . Patients assess safety efficacy throughout study , blood sample take pharmacokinetic assessment . The duration patient 's participation study minimum 27 day maximum 50 day start study treatment include ( intravenous treatment oral switch therapy ) 7 14 day active treatment . The late follow-up visit ( LFU ) perform 20 36 day last dose treatment . The assessment test cure ( TOC ) visit perform person 8 15 day last dose study drug Maximum duration study drug oral switch therapy Day 14 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Must ≥3 calendar month &lt; 18 year age . Patients age ≥3 calendar month &lt; 1 year must bear term ( define gestational age ≥37 week ) . 2 . Written inform consent parent ( ) legally acceptable representative ( ) , informed assent patient ( age appropriate accord local regulation ) 3 . If female reach menarche , reach Tanner stage 3 development ( even reach menarche ) ( refer Appendix E detail Tanner stag ) , patient authorise participate clinical study follow criterion meet : At screening : ( ) ( ) Patient report sexual abstinence prior 3 month report use least 1 acceptable method contraception , include intrauterine device ( copper band coil ) , levonorgestrel intrauterine system ( eg , Mirena® ) , regular medroxyprogesterone injection ( DepoProvera® ) ; ( b ) Patient agree initiate sexual abstinence time screen 7 day end treatment study drug ; ( ii ) Patient advise avoid conception time screen 7 day receipt study drug agree attempt pregnancy time screen 7 day end treatment study drug ; ( iii ) Patient provide guideline regard continuation abstinence , initiation abstinence , allow contraception ; ( iv ) Patient negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) test prior study entry . Since serum test may miss early pregnancy , relevant menstrual history sexual history , include method contraception , consider . Note : result serum βhCG test obtain prior dose investigational product , patient may enrol basis negative urine pregnancy test , though serum βhCG test result must still obtain . 4 . Patient clinically suspect and/or bacteriologically document cUTI acute pyelonephritis judge Investigator serious require patient hospitalised treatment intravenous ( IV ) therapy 5 . Patient pyuria : Cohorts 1 3 determined midstream clean catch clean urethral catheterisation urine specimen ≥10 white blood cell ( WBCs ) per high power field standard examination urine sediment ≥10 WBCs/mm3 unspun urine Cohort 4a 4b determined midstream clean catch clean urethral catheterisation urine specimen urine specimen obtain use urine collection pad ( suprapubic collection standard procedure assign site ) ≥5 WBCs per highpower field standard examination urine sediment ≥5 WBCs/mm3 unspun urine 6 . Patient positive urine culture : 1 midstream clean catch clean urethral catheterisation urine specimen take within 48 hour randomisation contain ≥105 colonyforming unit ( CFU ) /mL recognise uropathogen know susceptible IV study therapy ( CAZAVI cefepime ) Note : If patient meet entry criterion except positive urine culture outline , patient may enrol urine culture result available result likely ( base urinalysis clinical finding ) positive study drug consider appropriate empiric therapy . If patient urine culture negative 24 48 hour treatment patient improving , Investigator keep patient treatment . If urine culture negative patient improving , study treatment stop , patient follow rest study include undergoing safety assessment late follow ( LFU ) . 7 .
