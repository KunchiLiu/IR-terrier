	<criteria>Patients histological cytological diagnose malignant pleural mesothelioma age &gt; 18 year . Progressive disease least one course chemotherapy . Previous chemotherapy experimental therapy ≥ 4 week ago . Medically suitable limited surgical intervention ( pleural biopsy limit pleurectomy ) . Not consider candidate trimodality treatment ( part study ) . Measurable evaluable disease ( see tumor response assessment ) . Ability understand study give sign informed consent prior begin protocol specific procedure include approval second thoracoscopy transthoracic pleural biopsy third course . Radiotherapy allow give palliation , interval &gt; 12 week tumor within irradiation field . WHO performance status 0 1 ( see appendix 1 ) . Adequate organ function evidence follow peripheral blood count serum chemistry study entry : Hematology : Neutrophil count &gt; = 1.5 x 109/l , Platelets &gt; = 150 x 109/l , Hemoglobin &gt; = 6,0 mmol/l . Chemistry : Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time within upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; ASAT ALAT &lt; = 2.5x ULN , AP ( alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 5x ULN ( unless bone metastasis present absence liver disease ) . Age Reproductive Status Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use appropriate method ( ) contraception avoid pregnancy treatment 23 week last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior first dose nivolumab . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year treatment period 31 week last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile ) well azoospermic men require contraception . Active uncontrolled infection , severe cardiac dysfunction uncorrectable bleeding tendency . Inability perform biopsy pleural lesion . Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy &gt; = grade 2 accord NCI CTC , version 4.0 . Presence symptomatic CNS metastasis . Unstable peptic ulcer , unstable diabetes mellitus serious disable condition . Impaired renal function : creatinine clearance less 50ml/min . Concomitant administration experimental drug investigation . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease .
