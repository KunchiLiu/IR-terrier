	<detailed_description>Neuroplasticity important process associate memory learning , may impair early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Video game one potential strategy investigate adaptive cognitive learning . Recent neuroimaging study healthy young adult able detect brain change associate learn memory race video game relatively short training period couple hour . This strategy offer significant promise characterize potential neuroplasticity patient risk AD include amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) . This project apply video game training magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan investigate adaptive learning , work memory neuroplasticity function age patient aMCI . A total forty participant study . Twenty subject undergo video game training . Twenty subject passive control . Specific Aims : To characterize microstructural brain change video game training age subject determine patient amnestic MCI ( aMCI ) early AD affect . For study , adult participant age 50 old include patient aMCI early AD undergo two neuroimaging session space roughly two hour apart bracket around roughly 90 minute car racing game play . We use diffusion-weighted imaging detect longitudinal change microstructure hippocampus parahippocampus . A primary objective study demonstrate train image method translatable patient MCI . We investigate follow two important hypothesis . Hypothesis 1 : Following car race video game play , participant , average , demonstrate significant microstructural change hippocampal parahippocampal brain region measure MRI . Hypothesis 2 : The microstructural change hippocampus parahippocampus measure MRI significantly correlate ( ) cognitive memory performance assess recent memory assessment , ( b ) improvement video game performance participant . The primary outcome measure Hypotheses change MRI measurement follow car race video game play . A long-term objective project determine whether image short term neuroplasticity predictive individual patient either future conversion AD effectiveness cognitive training therapy . More generally , neuroimaging marker learning-induced brain plasticity would provide extremely useful tool investigation age , dementia , neurodegenerative disease .</detailed_description>
