	<brief_title>Diagnostic Immunization With Rabies Vaccine Patients With PID</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Primary objective : To study diagnostic immunization protocol rabies vaccine diagnosis patient primary immunodeficiency disorder . Secondary objective - To study humoral cellular immune response rabies vaccine patient primary immunodeficiency . - To study anti-rabies immunization protocol patient primary immunodeficiency disorder . Population Case group : Twenty primary immunodeficiency disease patient diagnose , treat follow Allergy Immunology unit , Department Pediatrics , Faculty Medicine , Chulalongkorn University . Control group : Twenty healthy subject underlying disease age-matched case patient . Inclusion exclusion criterion Vaccine : - Verorab® ( PVRV ; Purified Vero Cell Vaccine ) 0.5 ml intramuscular - Standard intramuscular regimen : ESSEN day 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 booster 1 year later day 360 363 Immunological evaluation : 1 . Humoral immune response : 5 ml blood sample collect antibody determination day 0 , 14 , 28 , 90 , 360 , 367 374 . Neutralizing antibody determine blindly use rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test ( RFFIT ) Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute . Rabies neutralize antibody report IU/ml The protective antibody level define rabies neutralize antibody ≥ 0.5 IU/ml . 2 . Cellular mediate immune response : On 5 ml blood sample collect antibody determination day 14 , 28 , 90 , 360 , 367 374 . Lymphocyte proliferation response rabies antigen determine use 3H-thymidine incorporation assay . The responder criterion define stimulation index ( SI index ) ≥ 2.0 consider evidence antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation .</detailed_description>
