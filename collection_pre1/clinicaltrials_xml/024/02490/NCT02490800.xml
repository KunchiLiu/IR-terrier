	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Study Oral BAL101553 Adult Patients With Solid Tumors Glioblastoma High-grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first study oral formulation BAL101553 . BAL101553 administer daily day 28-day treatment cycle capsule form adult advance recurrent solid tumor recurrent progressive glioblastoma high-grade glioma fail standard therapy , effective standard therapy available . The primary goal study find high dose BAL101553 safely give human assess side effect occur . The study start treat patient low dose . Once show low dose well tolerate , new patient treat high dose level ( `` dose escalation '' ) . Once high , well tolerate dose identify , additional patient treat dose ( part call `` dose expansion '' ) ass tolerability potential anticancer activity oral BAL101553 . The study also measure pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamic effect assess biomarkers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year 2 . Patients either follow : 1. histologically cytologically confirm advanced recurrent solid tumor , fail standard therapy , effective standard therapy available 2. histologicallyconfirmed GBM highgrade glioma , progressive recurrent disease prior radiotherapy , without chemotherapy . This also include patient histologicallyconfirmed lowgrade glioma present unequivocal evidence image transformation highgrade glioma/GBM . 3 . Patients advance solid tumor must measurable disease nonmeasurable prostate ovarian cancer follow prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) cancer antigen125 ( CA 125 ) . Patients glioblastoma highgrade glioma must measurable disease , define contrastenhancing MRI . Patients previous lowgrade glioma progress prior radiotherapy find highgrade glioma/GBM biopsy image . 4 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week 5 . Acceptable organ marrow function baseline ( protocol define laboratory parameter ) 6 . Patients advance solid tumor must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 1 patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . 7 . Other protocoldefined inclusion criterion may apply . 1 . Patients advanced recurrent solid tumor receive chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent within 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect prior therapy . Patients recurrent progressive GBM highgrade glioma : receive radiotherapy within 6 week , unless new area enhancement consistent recurrent tumor outside radiation field , histological confirmation unequivocal tumor progression ; receive administration prior antitumor chemotherapy within 4 week , within 6 week nitrosoureas ; undergone surgical resection within 4 week stereotactic biopsy/core biopsy within 1 week prior start study drug . 2 . Patients prior exposure BAL1015533 . 3 . Inability swallow oral medication 4 . Change steroid dose GBM highgrade glioma patient within 5 day prior first studydrug administration . 5 . Patients gastrointestinal disease procedure expect interfere oral absorption tolerance BAL101553 6 . Symptomatic brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease , indicative active disease , patient advance recurrent solid tumor . 7 . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2 . 8 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would unduly increase risk toxicity limit compliance study requirement 9 . Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90 mmHg screen visit . 10 . Blood pressure ( BP ) combination treatment two antihypertensive medication . 11 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Men woman reproductive potential willing apply effective birth control 12 . Other protocoldefined exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
