	<brief_summary>The prevalence otitis medium among Greenlandic child one high world twenty per cent schoolchildren impair hearing frequency normal speech . Yet , national guideline ensure prevention treatment recurrent acute otitis medium chronic otitis medium effusion impair hear Greenlandic child . International study develop part world show otitis prone child may benefit tubulation tympanic membrane . However , unknown result apply Greenlandic child . This PhD project conduct randomise control trial compare tubulation tympanic membrane , Greenlandic child age 9-36 month recurrent acute otitis medium and/or chronic otitis medium effusion , conservative treatment . The child follow two year . Outcome measure include number visit health clinic , number tympanic membrane perforation , number episode acute otitis medium accord medical record , Quality life , measure validated questionnaire OM6 Caregiver Impact Questionnaire , number episode per oral intravenous antibiotic administer accord medical record serious adverse event The trial conduct collaboration Greenlandic health authority Copenhagen Trial Unit . With trial investigator hope decrease number episode acute otitis medium , number Greenlandic child chronic perforation tympanic membrane hear impairment increase quality life . The result add important knowledge effect ventilation tube treatment also international aspect . There date le handful high quality study concern issue international basis . The study among first address problem among population high risk otitis medium also interest indigenous population develop part world .</brief_summary>
