	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause function disability impairment . Non-promising functional return upper limb rehabilitation report . With technology advance , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , form non-invasive direct brain stimulation , may act attenuator regulate modulate cortical excitability order facilitate cortical re-organization enhance behavioral performance . Various therapeutic exercise protocol investigate regard efficacy promote motor recovery affect upper limb patient stroke preliminary result supportive . However , limited number randomize control clinical trial publish investigate `` priming '' `` additive '' value low frequency repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) combination structural motor training program . Thus objective study : determine effectiveness combination low frequency rTMS contra-lesional M1 structure upper limb motor train program restore upper limb function among patient stroke sub-acute stage . It hypothesize rTMS , combine structured motor training program , confers additional therapeutic effect upper limb motor function subacute stroke patient , compare motor train program alone . The objective study determine effectiveness combination low frequent rTMS contra-lesional M1 structure upper limb motor train program restore upper limb function among patient subacute stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Frequency rTMS With Structured PT Training Restoring Upper Extremity Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study randomize double-blinded controlled trial . 26 stroke patient upper limb impairment receive outpatient physiotherapy service Queen Elizabeth Hospital fulfill eligibility criterion recruit randomize two interventional group : ( 1 ) rTMS + exercise ( rTMS-Ex ) group ( 2 ) Placebo rTMS +exercise ( Placebo-Ex ) group . Both rTMS-Ex placebo-Ex group receive 10 consecutive treatment session ( 5 session per week ) , consist real rTMS stimulation ( rTMS-ex group ) placebo rTMS ( placebo-Ex group ) , follow 30-minute structured upper limb strengthen task-specific motor training program . After 2 week brain stimulation motor training , group continue structure motor train program another 10 week ( 2 sessions/ week ) . 1. rTMS-Ex Group 10 consecutive session ( 5 day per week 2 week ) 1 Hz low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation contra-lesional M1 region 1200 pulse ( 20 minute ) 90 % motor threshold immediately follow 75 minute structure physiotherapy upper limb training . After 10 session brain stimulation , 30-minute structured physiotherapy upper limb training program continue another 12 week ( 2 session per week ) 2 . Placebo-Ex Group 10 consecutive session ( 5 session per week 2 week ) placebo stimulation contra-lesional M1 region immediately follow 30 minute structure physiotherapy upper limb training . Then , structure physiotherapy upper limb training continue another 12 week ( 2 session per week ) . Evaluation impairment level , motor performance , physiological measurement self -perceived disability perform 4 time point : treatment ( T0 ) , immediately treatment ( T1 ) , one-month follow-up ( T2 ) three-month follow-up ( T3 ) . 2-way repeated measure ANOVA use determine whether rTMS-ex group lead good outcome placebo-ex group .</detailed_description>
