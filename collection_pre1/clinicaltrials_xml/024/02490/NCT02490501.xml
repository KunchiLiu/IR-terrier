	<detailed_description>The study single dose study 3 sequence subject complete Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury . In sequence , 6 subject randomize surgical procedure SC0806 implant spinal cord receive specific walk training , 3 subject randomize specific walk training . Interim analyse safety parameter perform . If positive effect major safety concern demonstrate completion sequence , control subject give opportunity receive treatment SC0806 completion rehabilitation period .</detailed_description>
