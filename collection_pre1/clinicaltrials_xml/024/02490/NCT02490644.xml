	<detailed_description>One important factor affect post op complication cardiac surgery systemic inflammation . Valvular heart surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass cardioplegic arrest , arouse ischemic/reperfusion injury cause myocardial damage inflammatory response . These myocardial damage inflammatory response cause multi-organ failure even death . High-mobility group protein B1 ( HMGB1 ) protein encode HMGB1 gene human . HMGB1 secrete immune cell ( like macrophage , monocyte dendritic cell ) . Activated macrophage monocytes secrete HMGB1 cytokine mediator Inflammation . There many study suggest relationship HMGB1 acute coronary syndrome , myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury , atherosclerosis , heart failure cardiac disease marker inflammatory response . However , study evaluate HMGB1 prognostic factor valvular surgery , far .</detailed_description>
