	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy main treatment method patient Esophageal Cancer . However , Relapse remain major cause treatment failure.Biological therapy CIK stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . A series study report cytokine-induced killer cell ( CIK ) broad anti-tumor spectrum . The investigator suppose CIK improve prognosis . Combining chemotherapy biological therapy may kill tumor cell . In study , patient treat CIK cell chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate efficacy CIK Esophageal Cancer .</brief_summary>
