	<detailed_description>This prospective , open , multicenter study enroll patient clinical sign stroke prehospital setting . When dispatch center ( Sweden SOS Alarm 112 ) decides dispatch ambulance high priority ( 1 , lights/sirens active ) suspect case stroke , research nurse staff single responder vehicle equip Strokefinder MD100 dispatch scene , deem possible reach site ahead first ambulance . The research nurse evaluate patient fulfills inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , delegation prehospital investigator . If confirm suitable study patient ask verbal informed consent . If answer affirmative microwave measurement perform patient lie ambulance stretcher another suitable surface . The procedure take less five minute ( duration actual measurement &lt; 1 minute ) interfere patient 's standard care transport receive hospital . Written inform consent acquire hospital investigator , soon possible acute phase care complete . A follow-up microwave measurement perform hospital investigator patient admit Stroke Unit Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Sahlgrenska conjunction Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan , perform part standard care within 48 hour stroke onset . The measurement data evaluate presence signal artifact . The diagnostic ability device evaluate use leave-one-out cross validation ( LOOCV ) method CT diagnosis ground truth . The time arrival patient side completion measurement procedure , duration measurement procedure , measure . Safety evaluate throughout study , safety follow-up perform hospital investigator 24 hour last microwave measurement finalize . No follow-up patient plan .</detailed_description>
