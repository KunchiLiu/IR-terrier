	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) follow spinal surgery frequent complication result higher morbidity , mortality healthcare cost . SSI follow adult spinal surgery frequent complication report occur 0.7-12.0 % patient result high postoperative morbidity , mortality health care cost . Vanderbilt University Medical Center SSI rate 7 % . Treatment SSI challenge often require revision surgery , long-term antibiotic , prolonged hospitalization . The accurate identification risk factor thus important development strategy prevent potentially devastating infection . This study propose randomize , control trial neuro-spine patient 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate skin preparation cloth prevention post op surgical site infection spine patient . Use CHG cloth night morning surgery ( neckline toe ) affect ( decrease rate ) SSI compare patient receive routine standard care ( soap water pre-op , day surgery daily post-operative ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2 % Chlorhexidine Gluconate Skin Cloths Prevent SSI Spine Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-operatively patient schedule neurosurgical spine case evaluate approached interest , consent process complete , patient randomize one 2 arm 1:1 block randomization table . Those enrolled study arm receive CHG cloth instruction use research personal . Those randomize control arm receive standard care skin cleanse nursing staff . All subject sign consent skin swab culture take day screen prior cleanse Chlorhexidine gluconate wipe close intended incision line . The investigator also obtain skin swab culture site incision preoperatively day surgery , post-op day 4 time discharge 30 day follow . Both group evaluate daily study personnel development SSI post-op day 4 hospital discharge whichever one come first . After dress removal , daily high definition picture take incision line document sign SSI development ( picture patient identifiable information ) . Additional evaluation take place 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) post-op visit . Blinded evaluator utilize CDC guideline grade incision line presence SSI . Measured change skin flora perform compare skin swab culture intervention group versus standard care group individual change pre post operatively .</detailed_description>
