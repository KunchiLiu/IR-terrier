	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Warm Cold Compress Reduce Injection Site Erythema Due Peginterferon-beta-1a MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common adverse event associate subcutaneously ( SC ) inject drug injection site reaction ( ISR ) include redness pain.Theoretically , heat cold modality may improve interferon injection tolerance . Warm compress injection may increase local blood flow increase rapid systemic absorption , cold compress afterward may reduce erythema , edema pain often follow SC injection . A trial compare heat-before cold-after therapy warrant determine relative effectiveness modality . Intervention : Product : Reusable cold warm compress . Patients receive write instruction microwave heat freezer cool compress . Warm compress : Pre-heating microwave oven , per instruction . Apply warm compress 5 minute prior injection . The initial compress temperature 43 degree Celsius ( range 40-46 degree Celsius ) slowly decline application . Administer drug soon removal . Cold compress : Cooling freezer per instruction . Soon drug injection , apply cold compress 10 minute . The initial compress temperature range 15-18 degree Celsius . - Timers utilized mark 5-minute 10-minute treatment interval - Participants encourage maintain constant practice regard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use study Study Objectives : 1 . To assess compare impact erythema two thermal treatment : warm compress prior PEG injection cold compress follow PEG injection 2 . To assess natural history PEG-erythema time . This accomplish 18 week observation control group .</detailed_description>
