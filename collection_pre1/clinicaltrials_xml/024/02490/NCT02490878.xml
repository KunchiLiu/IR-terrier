	<detailed_description>This randomize double-blinded phase II study corticosteroid bevacizumab vs. corticosteroid placebo brain radionecrosis follow radiosurgery brain metastasis . This two-arm clinical trial parallel group design longitudinal quality life endpoint . Patients stratify accord age ( ≤ 65 year vs. &gt; 65 year ) , pathological confirmation necrosis ( yes vs. ) , MDASI-BT mean global score ( symptom + interference score ) ( &lt; 4.0 vs. &gt; 4.0 ) prior whole brain radiotherapy ( yes vs. ) . The primary secondary objective detail . Primary Objective : To investigate whether addition bevacizumab standard corticosteroid therapy result great improvement symptom ( clinical patient-reported symptom improvement associate radionecrosis less radionecrosis treatment-induced symptom ) compare standard corticosteroid therapy . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate toxicity profile associate bevacizumab corticosteroid therapy . 2 . To compare self-reported health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) use LASA , Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire-Chronic ( DSQ-C ) , MDASI-BT symptom interference score treatment arm . 3 . To compare intracranial progression-free survival time maximum radiographic response treatment arm . 4 . To compare dose duration corticosteroid require treatment arm correlate steroid requirement DSQ-C MDASI-BT score . Patient event monitoring occur every 2 month treatment 6 month . Then event monitor occur one year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Eligibility Criteria : 1 . Patients present symptomatic brain radionecrosis receive radiosurgery brain metastasis primary solid tumor include limited lung , breast , colorectal cancer exclude melanoma , choriocarcinoma , renal cell carcinoma gliomas 2 . Patients institution elect utilize central image review confirm eligibility must preregistered prior submission image ; image submit soon possible preregistration magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) obtain ; turnaround time review = &lt; 72 business hour receipt image Imaging Radiation Oncology Core ( IROC ) 3 . Patients institution elect confirm eligibility locally may preregistered time randomize Registration/Randomization Eligibility Criteria : 1 . A diagnosis radionecrosis base clinical onset symptom radiological finding radionecrosis 324 month follow radiosurgery , without pathological confirmation . 1.1 'Symptomatic ' brain radionecrosis least one lesion follow radiosurgery treatment brain metastases 'symptomatic ' define : 1.1.1 New increase headache associate mass effect , sensory motor abnormality , cognitive change , speech difficulty , balance coordination difficulty , cranial nerve deficit 1.1.2 Symptoms persistent worsen despite administration least dexamethasone 4 mg daily 1 week 1.2 Clinical eligibility support central imaging realtime review . The presence least following conventional MR image characteristic : 1.2.1 Conventional MR Lesion quotient &lt; 0.3 , lesion quotient define proportional value maximum axial crosssectional area T2weighted define lesion maximum axial crosssectional area contrastenhancing lesion T1weighted postgadolinium sequence comparable axial slice . If conventional MR finding see , follow dynamic susceptibilitycontrast ( DSC ) MR characteristic may use meet eligibility study . 1.2.2 DSC MR The cutoff base GRE EPI DSC perfusion image , acquire without use gadolinium preload : 1.2.2.1 Relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) &lt; 1.5 enhance lesion relative normalappearing white matter ( NAWM ) 1.2.2.2 . Percentage signal recovery ( PSR ) &gt; 76 % , PSR determine compare low signal intensity passage contrast bolus postcontrast signal intensity signal intensitytime curve 1.2.3 Centers standardly use PET MRS determine diagnosis radionecrosis permit use modality assist patient selection ; however criterion describe conventional MR and/or DSC also meet study eligibility . Both PET MRS mandatory study eligibility . 2 . Prior start treatment 2.1 Must take stable dose corticosteroid symptom management least 1 week baseline MRI . 2.2 No systemic therapy within 2 week prior registration plan systemic therapy within first 8 week study registration . The protocol provide list 'approved systemic ' therapy allow concurrent use bevacizumab . 2.3 No bevacizumab ≤ 3 month study registration . 2.4 Central image realtime review ( 72 hour turn around ) confirm eligibility . 3 .
