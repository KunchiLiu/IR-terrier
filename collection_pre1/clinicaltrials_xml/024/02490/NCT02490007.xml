	<brief_summary>Aim To assess possible food allergy-preventive benefit use whole cell pertussis ( wP ) vaccination compare acelluar pertussis vaccine ( aP ) whooping cough vaccination childhood . Background Whooping cough , cause bacteria , Bordetella pertussis , represent significant public health burden Australia around world . Acellular pertussis vaccination ( aP ) replace whole cell vaccination pertussis ( wP ) late 1990s . This replacement coincide temporally observe rapid rise occurrence severe food allergy response . Previous research suggest acellular pertussis vaccination result development immunity may predispose child allergic response . A retrospective case-controlled trial design , target case previously diagnose allergy , compare case vaccination history whole population , powerful mean assess association immunisation allergy . Participant Groups 1000 allergy case , 10,000 control Project Design This retrospective individually-matched case-control study Australian child born period transition use wP vaccine aP vaccine ( year birth 1997-1999 inclusive ) register Australian Children Immunisation Register . Cases drawn allergy clinic associate tertiary teaching hospital around Australia . Methods Cases : retrospectively identify patient list allergy clinic around Australia , born period pertussis vaccine changeover , confirm IgE-mediated food allergy basis 1 ) document history consistent clinical symptom follow ingestion implicate food , 2 ) evidence sensitisation food via laboratory test . Controls : Controls sample de-identified database child bear transition wP aP vaccination appear ACIR . Cases control matched date birth ( +/-7 day ) , jurisdiction socioeconomic decile . Expected outcome : Following study , investigator able determine association type vaccination receive development IgE mediate food allergy . If whole cell vaccination find protective association development allergy , profound impact health policy Australia around world .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Atopic diseases become important cause chronic morbidity among child wealthy country . In particular , food allergy , include life-threatening food-related anaphylaxis , grow alarm rate . For example , one Australian allergy clinic observe 12-fold rise consultation food allergy child 1995 2006 . In 15 year 2009/10 , hospitalisation food-related anaphylaxis young Australian child increase 8-fold . No effective broadly implementable strategy curb 'second wave ' atopic disease discover . In Australia , abrupt rise food allergy coincide closely replacement antigenically complex whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( wP ) subunit acellular pertussis vaccine ( aP ) begin late 1990s . Pertussis vaccine protect Bordatella Pertussis , causative agent whooping cough . Investigators previously show marked difference immune stimulate profile wP compare aP . wP show induce strong Th1 type immunity aP induces Th2 type response . Immune responses broadly group cellular ( Th1 ) antibody mediate immunity ( Th2 ) . Natural protective immunity pertussis rely strong Th1 type response clear pathogen . This closely mimicked immunity induce whole cell vaccine ( wP ) . In contrast , acellular vaccine relies development antibody mediate protection . While antibody mediate response protective short term , strong induction Th2 response may deleterious aspect immune response . The develop infant immune system show Th2 bias , may skew delivery vaccine strong Th2 immune profile . Dysregulation Th1/Th2 balance exist immune system lead disease state . Predominance Th2 environment lead development atopy allergy . A number study , exemplify centre , detail Th2 immune bias induce infant receive DTaP-only schedule , result excessive IgE production vaccine antigens . This likely due combine effect 1 ) carry-over Th2-biased utero phenotype , 2 ) presence alum pertussis toxin Th2-adjuvantising property , 3 ) absence balance Th1-stimulating ligand present DTwP . These effect manifest strongly infancy among child evidence underlie Th2-skewed phenotype . Studies demonstrate inclusion even single wP dose pertussis prim schedule associate reduction Th2-polarised T cell memory magnitude IgE response compare aP-only schedule . Based finding hypothesise inclusion single wP dose pertussis prim schedule might preserve Th1/Th2 balance develop infant immune system . Thus , study test hypothesise removal wP infant vaccine schedule contribute observed rise IgE-mediated food allergy . AIM To assess possible food allergy-preventive benefit use wP compare aP pertussis vaccination childhood . OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOME MEASURES Primary objective To determine Australian child born 1997 1999 ( inclusive ) receive wP first pertussis vaccine dose infancy less likely subsequently develop IgE-mediated food allergy compare contemporaneous child receive aP first pertussis vaccine dose infancy . Secondary objective To determine Australian child born year 1997 1999 ( inclusive ) receive least one dose wP pertussis vaccine age less likely subsequently develop IgE-mediated food allergy compare contemporaneous child receive aP pertussis vaccine . To determine Australian child born year 1997 1999 ( inclusive ) receive wP pertussis vaccine exclusively less likely subsequently develop IgE-mediated food allergy compare contemporaneous child receive aP pertussis vaccine . STUDY DESIGN This retrospective individually-matched case-control study Australian child born period transition use wP contain pertussis vaccine aP contain pertussis vaccine ( year birth 1997-1999 inclusive ) register ACIR receive first dose pertussis vaccine age 16 week . Cases draw allergy clinic associate tertiary teaching hospital around Australia . 1000 case , identify IgE mediate food allergy review case history , appear ACIR enrol . Controls draw de-identified database Australian Childhood Immunisation Register hold National Centre Immunisation Research Surveillance Vaccine Preventable Diseases . Each case individually match 10 control . Project coordination epidemiological analysis conduct Wesfarmers Centre Vaccines Infectious Diseases Telethon Kids Institute Western Australia . STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS Sample size power consideration Sample size : A study 1000 match set case control , 10 match control case , least 80 % power detect 17 % low risk ( odds ratio 0.83 ) food allergy among child receive wP first dose pertussis vaccine compare receive aP first dose . This assume : ( ) 50 % control receive first pertussis vaccine dose wP ; ( ii ) correlation coefficient exposure ( first dose wP ) match case control 0.5 ; ( iii ) significance level 5 % ( Î±=0.05 ) . Investigators believe small effect size influence policy research direction . If 500 case meet case criterion study still least 80 % power detect 23 % low risk ( odds ratio 0.77 ) food allergy . Description Statistical Methods The cohort characteristic summarise case control status use mean standard deviation symmetric distribution medians inter-quartile range asymmetric distribution . Conditional logistic regression use estimate odds ratios correspond 95 % confidence interval association ( exposure ) pertussis vaccine type ( wP aP ) risk IgE-mediated food allergy . Because control sample register cohort irrespective past future case status , odds ratio interpret unbiased estimator relative risk food allergy among child receive wP compare aP vaccine .</detailed_description>

All case control must register ACIR first dose pertussis contain vaccine age 16 week period time transition aP wP vaccine occur ; birth date within 1st Janurary 1997 31st December 1999 depend jurisdiction . Case Inclusion Criteria Cases consider IgEmediated food allergy basis 1. document history consistent clinical symptom follow ingestion implicate food , 2. evidence sensitisation food via either positive skinprick test elevate specific IgE implicate food , onset first pertussiscontaining vaccine age 15 year . IgEmediated food allergy define BOTH : 1 . The clinical note clinical letter arise allergy consult must explicitly document presence one following feature . Onset least one feature must within 1 hour ingestion suspect food reasonably infer statement `` immediate '' , `` within x min '' x &lt; 60 : urticaria angioedema emesis vocal hoarseness persistent cough wheeze stridor collapse hypotension AND 2 . Documented evidence allergic sensitisation implicate food EITHER : specific IgE positive ( serum specific IgE &gt; 0.35KU/l ) suspect food ) , OR positive skin prick test ( wheal diameter &gt; 3mm ) suspect food ( SPT ) Evidence sensitisation must time consultation 6 month clinical encounter case meet definition .
