	<brief_title>ACT™ Balloons Versus Artificial Urinary Sphincter ( AMS800™ ) Treatment Female Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective multicenter randomize control trial compare two parallel arm : implantation adjustable balloon ( experimental arm ) versus implantation artificial urinary sphincter AMS800 ™ ( control arm ) , treatment female stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) due intrinsic sphincter deficiency ( ISD ) . This research focus assessment improve continence , quality life , Cost-Effectiveness Analysis . The tested device ACT ™ device prosthesis use support bladder neck proximal urethra increase urethral coaptation support bladder neck prevent urine leakage stress . The medical device AMS 800 ™ ( control arm ) implantable device make silicone elastomer fill saline/X-Ray fluid , use treatment stress urinary incontinence relate ISD . It design restore natural process urinary control . The device simulate normal sphincter function closing urethra allow patient void accord patient 's opening device ( sub-cutaneous pump ) . An inclusion visit take place 3 month 1 month date surgery explain purpose study , benefit risk patient , describe comparative medical device . Patients randomize surgery ( D0 ) . The follow-up conduct one year , schedule visit M1 , M3 , M6 M12 . Secondary endpoint assess schedule visit . The medico-economic assessment make follow-up period . This period take account improvement urinary continence result report 3rd month well morbidity mortality relate implementation medical device 1 year .</detailed_description>
