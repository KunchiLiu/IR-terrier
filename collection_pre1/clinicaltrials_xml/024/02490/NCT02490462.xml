	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) accordance recommendation Report Consolidated Standards Trials ( CONSORT ) hold Clinical School Physical Therapy , Federal University Bahia ( UFBA ) , Salvador , Bahia , cerebral palsy patient caregiver . Selection population : Inclusion criterion 's diagnosis cerebral palsy child , child include present grade II , III IV System Gross Motor Function Classification ( GMFCS ) age 6 month 12 year old , parent caregiver dedicate full-time child , comply intervention protocol sign free inform consent ( IC ) . They delete : Patients exclude disease peripheral nervous system brain stem , child chronic disease receive palliative care , child bone deformity scoliosis structure Cobb &gt; 30 low limb deformity . A sample 20 patient group require . The sample size study calculate , consider statistical power 80 % 5 % alpha . Evaluation procedure : To measurement motor function use Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM-88 ) scale . The range consist 5 sizes size engine development phase relate first quarter life . The GMFM-88 respect motor development stage present child evaluator assess dimension represent stage engine development age . To check Activity Participation use Inventory Pediatric Disability Assessment ( ASK ) . apply child 6 month 7.5 year . It also use old child functional limitation performance expect age compare typical child normative sample use child various type disability . The ASK apply member interdisciplinary team interview caretaker . Each item task ability realize score ( 1 ) whether child able ( 0 ) able perform . Evaluates functional ability performance area self-care ( 73 item ) , mobility ( 59 item ) social function ( 65 item ) . Measures also amount assistance give caregiver perform task possible use adaptation change environment . In caregiver assistance area self-care 8 item , 7 item mobility social function 5 item . The score range 0 5 ( total dependence complete independence ) . To investigate Quality Life use Child Health Questionnaire ( CHQ - PF50 ) , version parent , applicable child fifteen health . Each concept score 0-100 , high score indicate good health status , satisfaction well-being , result two summary score - physical psychosocial ( 0-70 ) . This questionnaire validate child cerebral palsy . All measure evaluate pre-intervention , 4 week , 8 week 12 week initiation therapy . Procedure : Using Education protocol caregiver child cerebral palsy intervention group , week , child control intervention group receive conventional physical therapy twice week . The established training period last twelve week . Software create randomization list ( randListÂ® ) use order ensure individual equal chance allocation group .</detailed_description>
