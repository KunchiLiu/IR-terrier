	<brief_summary>A recent prospective multicenter study Dr. Grossman demonstrate 40 % patient high grade glioma undergo radiation chemotherapy develop severe persistent lymphopenia ( CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 ) . This lymphopenia last twelve month follow radiation treatment multivariate analysis associate short survival . Our group data strongly suggest lymphopenia secondary inadvertent radiation circulate lymphocyte pass radiation beam . Investigators propose use FDA approve multiple sclerosis , fingolimod signal lymphocyte leave circulation prior initiation radiation . It functional antagonist sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor ( S1PR ) pathway prevents lymphocyte egress secondary lymphoid organ . Oral fingolimod give 1 week prior initiation concurrent radiation temozolomide discontinue immediately upon completion six week therapy . The primary objective evaluate fingolimod safely combine radiation temozolomide . Secondary endpoint total lymphocyte count ( TLC ) propose study participant . Investigators expect patient receive radiation temozolomide plus fingolimod recovery lymphocyte count 80 % baseline within four month , reference historical control sustain lymphopenia last twelve month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Fingolimod With Radiation Temozolomide Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five evaluable patient newly diagnose high grade glioma undergo standard concomitant radiation temozolomide follow adjuvant temozolomide accrue open-label , single arm , safety study . Oral fingolimod give 1 week prior initiation concurrent radiation temozolomide discontinue immediately upon completion six week therapy . The primary objective evaluate fingolimod safely combine radiation temozolomide . This standard chemoradiation cause 40 % patient develop severe lymphopenia two month initiation therapy . Investigators expect combine fingolimod , virtually patient severe lymphopenia two month begin treatment . Investigators determine patient routinely receive pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis develop severe opportunistic infection would prohibit evaluation novel treatment approach . Primary endpoint incidence great equal Grade III infection attributable fingolimod-induced lymphopenia define NIH/NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) within four month start fingolimod . The secondary objective obtain preliminary information regard ability fingolimod reduce radiation-related lymphopenia three month stop fingolimod . The NIH fund Adult Brain Tumor Consortium ( ABTC ) follow total lymphocyte CD4 count 96 patient treatment radiation temozolomide . The severe lymphopenia ( CD4 count le 200/mm3 ) last twelve month historical control . Secondary endpoint total lymphocyte count ( TLC ) propose study participant . These compare patient level data TLC historical cohort obtain ABTC . Investigators expect patient receive radiation temozolomide plus fingolimod recovery lymphocyte count 80 % baseline within four month , reference historical control sustain lymphopenia last twelve month . Investigators also obtain laboratory analysis lymphocyte subtypes cytokine level ( CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , IL-7 , TGF-Beta , etc. ) . Routine care high grade glioma include weekly Heme-8 absolute lymphocyte count . Research blood obtain 2 week prior chemoradiation week 6 , 10 , 18 , 26 46 . Patients study approximately one year .</detailed_description>
