	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : It show 30 % patient respond immunosuppressive therapy experience recurrence , graft rejection graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) decrease event-free survival 30 % 50 % alternative donor ( match unrelated , partially match family member ) transplantation . Although overall disease free survival 85 % 100 % , obtain allogeneic blood bone marrow stem cell transplantation use human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match sibling donor , 25 % patient donor . PURPOSE : In attempt avoid GVHD , reduce early infection rate decrease regimen-related toxicity maintain well engraftment , study evaluate effectiveness safety patient 's adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( AD-MSC ) AD-MSC transdifferentiated HSC ( AD-HSC ) transplant immunosuppressive regimen treat patient severe aplastic anemia . The patient study one year observation active monitoring . After treatment active monitoring , patient 's medical condition follow indefinitely . The principle measure safety efficacy : 1 . Patient survival probability 3 month , 6 month 1 year . 2 . Engraftment 3 month , 6 month 1 year 3 . Incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , incidence acute chronic GVHD Incidence early infection rate well complication within 6 month 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia characterize severe deficiency peripheral-blood platelet , white cell , red cell . These defect mature cell occur aplastic bone marrow contain severely reduced number hematopoietic stem cell . To date , Hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplant routinely used treat patient many different disease , include various cancer blood disorder , aplastic anemia . The main source HSCs bone marrow , cord blood peripheral blood . However , challenge include obtain enough functional HSCs ensure optimal engraftment , avoid immune rejection complication associate allogeneic transplantation . Novel abundant source clinical-grade HSCs therefore seek . Our novel study demonstrate adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( AD-MSCs ) convert rapidly ( 4 day ) AD-HSCs large scale ( 2X108-9 cluster differentiation 34（CD34）positive cell ) transfection small RNAs early region 1A ( E1A ) -like inhibitor differentiation 1 ( EID1 ) presence specific cytokine . In vitro , AD-HSCs expand efficiently resemble cord-blood HSCs phenotype , genotype , colony-forming ability . In mouse model , primary secondary transplantation analysis repopulating assay show AD-HSCs home bone marrow , differentiate functional blood cell , show long-term ability self-renew . show adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( AD-MSCs ) convert AD-HSCs transfection small RNAs E1A-like inhibitor differentiation 1 ( EID1 ) presence specific cytokine . In vitro , AD-HSCs expand efficiently resemble cord-blood HSCs phenotype , genotype , colony-forming ability . In mouse model , primary secondary transplantation analysis repopulating assay show AD-HSCs home bone marrow , differentiate functional blood cell , show long-term ability self-renew . In safety aspect , saw evidence leukemia , teratoma cancer blood , testes subcutaneous tissue transplant mice . More importantly , preliminary data show AD-HSCs reconstitute hematopoietic function five patient severe aplastic anemia . Based premilitary study , , determine conduct clinical investigation multiple medical center . In study plan enroll 90 patient , make comprehensive assessment new treatment regimen show equal superior current immunosuppressive regimen . Patients study one year treatment active monitoring . All patient follow death .</detailed_description>
