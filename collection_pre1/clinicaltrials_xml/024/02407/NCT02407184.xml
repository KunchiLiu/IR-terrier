	<detailed_description>Human microbiota play important role function various organ , well education immune system . Mammals evolve born non-sterile , covered maternal vaginal bacteria populate maternal birth canal , well exclusively breastfeed early development . Unfortunately , process substantially altered modern Western practice , may health consequence . In particular , C-section associate increase risk immune diseases allergy . This study explore effect expose neonate vaginal environment birth , perinatal antibiotic , lactation acquisition new microbial gene first year infant microbiome development . This study follow 78 baby healthy mother ( 18-40 year old ) uncomplicated pregnancy . The baby divide three group accord exposure vaginal environment birth : Group 1 : ( n-26 ) Babies bear via vaginal delivery . Group 2 : ( n-26 ) Babies bear via schedule C-section without exposure mother 's vaginal bacteria birth . Group 3 : ( n-26 ) Babies bear via scheduled C-section exposure mother 's vaginal microbiota birth . Sampling Time Points : Subjects may join study point pregnancy soon delivery . If possible , sample mother obtain three time prior delivery third trimester : 30 , 4 few day prior mother 's due date , well day birth prior delivery . If possible , sample mother baby obtain birth onwards . Samples collect mother baby day 1 , day 2 3 , weekly first month , monthly first year . During monthly sampling , member study team communicate mother regularly assess change infant 's diet health visit . Body Sites Sampled Mother Baby : At sample , total 6 sample take baby ( feces , mouth , nose , forehead skin , right forearm skin , right hand skin ) 9 take mother ( baby plus right areola , vagina , breast milk ) . Sampling consist simple swabbing designate body site , well collection mother 's breast milk . Each time sample collect , information subject 's diet , medication supplement use , sleep , physical activity overall health ask survey order correlate change life subject change his/her microbiota . C-section Exposure Vaginal Environment Procedure : Mothers give birth NYULMC Bellevue Hospital comply inclusion exclusion criterion exposure maternal vaginal content choose expose newborn sample vaginal microbiome birth . Such mother test confirm vaginal pH acidic ( pH ≤ 4 ) , indicate dominance lactic acid bacteria . Testing vaginal pH perform use pH paper . These procedure require presence study member perform NYULMC Bellevue hospital . Samples vaginal bacteria collect prior C-section . A piece gauze place birth canal antibiotic administration , remove caesarian procedure begin . This period longer 1 hour long . However , amount time gauze birth canal sufficient proceed swab procedure . Once remove mother , gauze store sterile container birth . Immediately delivery , train study team member swab neonate gauze multiple body site , start mouth , face , subsequently remainder his/her body . After swab , 6 sample normally take newborns collect .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria ALL subject : Healthy mother , 1840 year old uncomplicated pregnancy deliver term ( 37 week later ) Mothers ethnic social background speak , read , understand English extent consent English OR mother speak English yet agree come NYU hospital sampling . Additional inclusion criterion mother Csection exposure vaginal environment group ( CS+E ) : Scheduled Csection Vaginal pH ≤ 4 time birth ( measure via pH paper ) Exclusion Criteria ALL subject : Mothers preeclampsia serious chronic condition Mothers complicate pregnancy Mothers 18 year age 40 year age Babies complication delivery Babies deliver prior 37 week gestation Additional exclusion criterion mother Csection exposure vaginal environment group ( CS+E ) : Mothers report positive active primary herpes , genital wart , HIV , Group B Streptococcus , gonorrhea , chlamydia , bacterial vaginosis , yeast infection , trichomoniasis . Mothers vaginal pH &gt; 4 time birth ( measure via pH paper ) . Known positive Group B Strep test result rectal vaginal swab within five week schedule caesarian .</criteria>
