	<detailed_description>Patients locally advanced rectal esophageal carcinoma typically undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy prior surgical resection , although specific chemoradiation regimen may vary . While response rate differ among three cancer , generally 20-25 % patient exhibit minimal response preoperative chemoradiation therapy 20-30 % exhibit complete pathologic response , remainder receive partial response . In esophageal adenocarcinoma , patient achieve complete response tend significantly long overall survival achieve complete response . Similar data exists rectal cancer degree responsiveness chemoradiation regimens dictate survival outcome patient . If patient distinct response profile identify treatment start , personalize regimen deliver maximize benefit patient population : complete responder may spar post-treatment surgical resection , non responder may consider avoid ineffective chemoradiation prior surgery . Target Population : Subjects newly diagnose rectal adenocarcinoma , anal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation prior surgery . 350 patient sample include validation study , give predict 25 % population size exhibit pathologic complete response ( pathCR ) pre-operative chemo/radiation therapy , predict 25 % population size response ( exCTRT ) pre-operative treatment . Study Design : This multi-center prospective study 350 patient , pre-treatment ( prior chemoradiation ) unstained section charge slide FFPE block use diagnosis rectal anal cancer section unstained , post-surgical , resected tissue ( pathologic confirmation treatment response base upon endoscopy ultrasound accept place post-surgical resected tissue ) . Per CLIA-compliant SOPs ( Appendix A ) , one slide stain H &amp; E define area tumor within tissue , remain slide use immunohistochemical ( IHC ) detection biomarkers describe assess performance proprietary IHC assay . Any remain slide use IHC stain use parallel gene expression discovery effort use TaqMan high throughput RT-PCR analysis ( Appendix B , Sub-study 1 ) . The proprietary assay perform CLIA certify standard operating procedure . The individual assay result , treatment effect , actual survival data , clinical data analyze . Initial label index data use develop training set unique algorithmic approach specifically applicable rectal anal carcinoma . The remain sample embargoed use independent test set . Associated clinical data collect : 1 . Age patient diagnosis 2 . Gender 3 . Date diagnosis rectal/anal cancer 4 . Histotype rectal/anal cancer 5 . Stage rectal/anal cancer diagnosis neoadjuvant treatment ( available ) 6 . Details image perform 7 . Clinical histopathalogical feature primary tumor 8 . Details genetic testing perform . 9 . Extent/approach surgical resection 10 . Date last contact 11 . First progression documentation ( Y/N ) . If yes , location first progression date first progression . 12 . Method diagnosis first progression . 13 . Death documentation ( Y/N ) . If yes , date death , cause death . 14 . Pre-operative treatment receive : 1 . Start/stop date radiation 2 . Radiation dose , fraction give , interruption treatment ( Y/N ) , reason Yes 3 . Start/stop date chemotherapy 4 . Chemotherapeutic agent ( ) dose , interruption treatment ( Y/N ) , reason Yes 15 . Post-surgical treatment receive : 1 . Start/stop date radiation 2 . Radiation dose , fraction give , interruption treatment ( Y/N ) , reason Yes 3 . Start/stop date chemotherapy 4 . Chemotherapeutic agent ( ) dose , interruption treatment ( Y/N ) , reason Yes</detailed_description>
