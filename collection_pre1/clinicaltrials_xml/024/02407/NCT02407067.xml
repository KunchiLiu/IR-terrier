	<brief_title>A Comparison Voice Amplifiers Personal Communication Systems Individuals With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study involve comparison 2 type communication device approve use individual communication disorder . One device , voice amplifier , frequently prescribe individual Parkinson 's disease consider part standard care symptom low speech intensity disorder . The device frequently prescribe individual hear impairment ( unrelated Parkinson 's disease ) consider part standard care individual Parkinson 's disease . This clinical study use crossover design participant receive device , one , order randomize across individual . There control group placebo . This study include three group participant : 1 ) PD participant group ( n=20 ) , 2 ) communication partner ( CP ) group ( n=20 ) , 3 ) naïve listener group ( n=10 ) . The PD participant group comprise individual mild moderate sign symptom idiopathic PD hypophonia confirm neurologist . For individual PD , speech test occur approximately one hour take antiparkinsonian medication accord regular medication schedule . The communication partner group consist individual regularly converse PD participant ( i.e . spouse primary caregiver ) . The naive listener group consist student Western University . The participant PD wear head-set microphone ( AKG c520 ) . The speech intensity participant PD calibrate sound level meter ( Luton SL-4001 ) place 15cm mouth participant produce steady 70dB A prolonged `` ah '' 2 second . Two additional tripod-mounted microphone ( Shure SM48 ) place 2 meter 4 meter PD participant . The communication partner participant seat approximately 30cm two microphone 2 4 meter interlocutor distance condition . The output 3 microphone connect preamplifiers digitize unit ( M-Audio MobilePre ) attach via USB connection PC computer run Praat record analysis software ( Boersma &amp; Weenink , 2013 ) . An additional , fourth input line attach digitize unit output personal communication system device use study . All four audio signal digitize 44.1 kHz 16 bit store uncompressed .wav audio file . The voice amplifier personal communication system evaluate random order across participant . The voice amplifier ChatterVox . This amplifier include headset microphone wire speaker/amplifier unit worn waist belt . The ChatterVox select typical type voice amplifier frequently recommend prescribed individual PD Ontario . Despite paucity publish voice amplifier study PD , ChatterVox use several publish study non-neurological voice disorder study elementary school teacher occupational-related voice problem ( McCormick &amp; Roy , 2002 ; Roy et al . 2003 ) . In addition , recent MSc thesis conduct Western University Monika Andreetta ( supervise Professor Scott Adams ) find ChatterVox one best performing preferred device participant PD compare 6 voice amplifier . The personal communication system evaluate Easy Listener FM system ( Phonic Ear Corp. ) . This system include light-weight , pocket-sized ( 2.5 x 9.4 x 5.6 cm ; 80 gram ) transmitter unit head-set microphone nearly identical , pocket-sized receiver unit set small headphone . These unit carry breast-pocket attach waist-belt clip . The transmitter receiver unit wireless communicate via FM signal . The communication range unit approximately 30 meter . The PD participant wear transmitter/microphone unit communication partner ( CP ) participant wear receiver/headphone unit . While several personal communication system available , Easy Listener personal communication system frequently prescribe use several previous study individual hear impairment ( Schafer &amp; Thibodeau , 2004 ) . During experimental condition PD CP participant present 65dB A multi-talker noise ( use standard Audiotec Corp. Recording 4-talker noise ) . The noise present computer via audio amplifier loudspeaker place 2 meter participant . A sound level meter use calibrate noise level loudspeaker . Procedures : Speech Tasks : Once one two device attach participant ( ) , PD participant give list 6 sentence randomly generate Sentence Intelligibility Test software . The PD participant read aloud sentence pause communication partner ( CP ) participant attempt repeat aloud sentence . The SIT provide intelligibility measure , commonly use document effectiveness intervention program outcome study ( Beukelman et al. , 2007 ) . Furthermore , supportive research SIT complete dysarthric speaker ( Beukelman et al. , 2007 ) . After list 6 sentence complete PD participant give several picture people engage various activity ( i.e . fishing , play baseball , dish , etc . ) PD participant make statement describe picture CP participant repeat aloud statement . This continue 6 statement ( minimum 5 word ) produced/repeated . Speech Conditions : The speech task repeat device use two device ( ChatterVox voice amplifier Easy Listener personal communication system ) two noise condition ( none 65dB multi-talker noise ) two interlocutor distance ( 2 4 meter ) . These condition randomize . Rating Scale Procedures : Immediately follow speech task PD CP participant ask rate experience device use visual analogue scale relate follow five parameter : 1 . Physical comfort : uncomfortable versus comfortable 2 . Visual presentation : unacceptable versus acceptable 3 . Sound quality : poor sound quality versus good sound quality 4 . Amplification power : poor amplification versus good amplification 5 . Overall preference : low preference versus high preference The PD CP participant use five visual analogue scale provide separate rating two device . Following completion rating scale participant encourage provide additional feedback impression 2 device . One Week Trial Periods : After completion lab-based speech rating scale procedure PD CP participant give instruction care use one two device ( i.e . recharging , cleaning , volume adjustment , attachment , positioning , etc . ) take device home one week trial period . The participant ask use device often desire use device least 3 time period least one hour course week . The participant give Device Use Diary write date , time , volume setting contexts use device . The participant return one week complete questionnaire rating scale related experience evaluation device . These include following : 1 . Visual analogue scale related physical comfort , visual presentation , sound quality , amplification power , overall preference . 2 . Speech Amplification Satisfaction Scale 3 . Quebec User Evaluation Satisfaction Assistive Technology Scale 4 . Psychosocial Impact Assistive Devices Scale ( PIADS ) . Following completion questionnaire rating scale , participant give instruction use care second device take device home another one week trial period . The participant ask use device often desire use device least 3 time period least one hour course week . The participant give Device Use Diary write date , time , volume setting contexts use device . The participant return one week complete previously describe questionnaire rating scale related experience evaluation device . Listening Tasks : Listener participant listen pre-recorded speech sample obtain tripod-mounted microphone . Speech sample play randomized order . Listeners present time speech sample record , blind information speaker content sentence SIT picture description task prior hear . Listeners seat comfortable distance loudspeaker , fix comfortable predetermined volume , ask transcribe data orthographically prepared form number match presentation order stimulus . The SIT software compute intelligibility score compare transcribed word sentence stimuli master list . For picture description task , sentence transcribe independently assessor compare listener ' transcription determine intelligibility score .</detailed_description>
