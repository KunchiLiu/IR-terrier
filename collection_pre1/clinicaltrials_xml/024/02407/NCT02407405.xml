	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Plexiform Neurofibromas That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate ( plexiform neurofibromas [ PN ] volume decrease &gt; = 20 % compare baseline ) selumetinib adult patient neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) inoperable PN . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate 3 dimensional ( 3D ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) responses percent target inhibition ( phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase [ pERK ] ) PN biopsy obtain pretreatment treatment selumetinib . II . Pathology evaluation tumor change treatment selumetinib . III . Analyze pair biopsy mechanisms response resistance selumetinib : measurement phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( pAKT ) , tumor kinome , tumor transcriptome . IV . Compare pERK inhibition dermal neurofibromas PN . V. Evaluate immune infiltrate plexiform neurofibroma , well peripheral blood presence circulate tumor cell . VI . Evaluate steady state pharmacokinetics selumetinib ( blood ) correlate steady state level response pERK inhibition . VII . Analyze bone marrow derive precursor cell cytokine blood sample obtain pretreatment treatment selumetinib . VIII . Compare volumetric response target inhibition pathway activation PN nodular lesion . IX . Establish patient derive xenograft . X . Characterize effect selumetinib pain , quality life , physical functioning . XI . Determine baseline functional impairment secondary PN , effect selumetinib functional outcome depend PN location . XII . Determine effect selumetinib PN growth rate base volumetric analysis MRI study obtain prior enrollment ( available amenable volumetric analysis ) . XIII . Determine time progression ( TTP ) progression free survival ( PFS ) progressive PN ( &gt; = 20 % increase PN volume within 12-15 month prior enrollment ) . XIV . Evaluate change dermal neurofibroma burden use digital photography . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) ( approximately every 12 hour ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
