	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim test model predicts enhance neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) function reward affect-regulation central nervous system ( CNS ) circuit mediates antidepressant effect exercise . State-of-the-art magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging , cognitive assessment , accelerometry , genetic , inflammatory biomarkers acquire coordination effort several establish research program Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic . This pilot study use platform test causal/mediating role GABA interneurons reward process affect regulation human . This pilot study power test full causal model , rather intended test overall feasibility intervention acquisition measure ( see specific aim 1 ) . This necessary prerequisite design large definitive study model , component future grant application . Additionally , data study use test clinical efficacy exercise adjunctive treatment late life depression ( LLD ; Specific Aim 2 ) , well image , cognitive , sleep aim ( Specific Aims 3 4 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-level Life-span Characterization Adult-depression Effects Medication Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Establish infrastructure , protocol , procedure recruit , screen , enrol , maintain sample 30 adult ( young adult old adult ) major depression 12-week exercise intervention . The primary aim establish feasibility proof-of-concept wide range biologically clinically relevant outcome . Aim 2 : Examine whether 12-week physical activity + pharmacotherapy intervention reduces depressive symptom young old adult beyond treatment usual ( TAU ) . Hypothesis 1 : In young older adult antidepressant property pharmacotherapy augment combined aerobic exercise combine intervention high rate response remission compare pharmacotherapy treatment . Aim 3 : Examine whether 12-week combined physical activity pharmacotherapy intervention change structural morphology specific subfields hippocampus . Hypothesis 1 : The medication intervention increase hippocampal volume dentate gyrus carbonic anhydrase I ( CA1 ) , combine aerobic exercise pharmacotherapy magnify effect exercise . Hypothesis 2 : The effect hippocampal volume large old versus young adult Aim 4 : Explore combination pharmacotherapy exercise ( compare pharmacotherapy TAU ) influence range brain behavioral outcome , include rest state brain dynamic , MR spectroscopic measure GABA , sleep efficiency , cognitive performance . Hypothesis 1 : Antidepressant pharmacotherapy alter rest state network , increase GABA level , improve sleep efficiency cognitive performance - effect great combine aerobic exercise intervention . Hypothesis 2 : These effect moderate age effect great old adult , support dissociation depression young adult , provide justification fully power study explore model treatment-predictive biomarkers . Depression significant global public health concern ; second lead cause disability worldwide currently estimate affect 350 million people . Antidepressant medication show effective placebo treat depression . However , 20-40 % individual suffer depression pharmacotherapy slow inadequate response . Thus , identify alternative treatment depression public health priority . Background : Physical activity emerge one promise non-pharmaceutical treatment depression . Greater amount self-reported physical activity associate few depressive symptom epidemiological study randomize intervention find participation physical activity enhances mood depressed population . A Cochrane review 32 randomized intervention conclude participation physical activity effective reduce depressive symptom compare either treatment control condition . Importantly , antidepressant physical activity may work similar biological pathway influence mood cognitive function . In fact , antidepressant physical activity increase level Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) serum hippocampus , may mitigate reverse hippocampal atrophy , influence expression kinetics serotonin GABA pathway , regulate brain network connectivity , alter inflammatory pathway , improve sleep efficiency . Our proposal aim characterize effect genetic behavioral cognitive level , isolate effect physical activity medication . Significance : If effective , physical activity could become first line treatment depression , might also help reduce cognitive deficit , job productivity , risk psychiatric condition . Furthermore , although physical exercise show promise reduce depressive symptom , researcher still understand biological pathway work . One lead hypothesis depression disruption GABA system underlie deficit . In contrast , improvement GABA signal one way exercise may improve brain function reduce depressive symptom . Along line , investigator hope determine type exercise ( aerobic versus stretch tone ) promote future improve brain function reduce depressive symptom . Demonstrating link could important first step develop effective treatment plan suffer depression .</detailed_description>
