	<brief_summary>Investigators hope study patient 1 cochlear implant hearing preservation surgery compare change brain patient normal hearing patient scan brain listening speech . The information investigator collect may help investigator understand brain learns hear cochlear implant whether us area brain listen normal hearing patient well predict patient well cochlear implant specialise operation need insert cochlear implant ear do surgeon country . After operation , patient need several month teach help learn hear implant . Having cochlear implant require lot cooperation time patient investigator could understand brain learns hear cochlear implant predict patient well may able avoid unnecessary procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroplastic Changes Seen Cochlear Implants With Preserved Hearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cochlear implant establish treatment individual hear loss conventional hearing aid fail provide appropriate hearing amplification result poor speech language perception . Although large proportion patient cochlear implant expect well implant , still uncertainty individual poorly . Furthermore investigator limit knowledge brain interacts cochlear implant process speech . Evidence suggest underlying central mechanism responsible process speech use implant related neuroplasticity . That say brain establishes new cortical network vital auditory centre cochlear implant thus enable process speech . Investigators recently complete study compare cortical change occur subject bilateral cochlear implant normal hearing control . In study group patient subject binaural simultaneous auditory stimulus . Analysis suggest subject bilateral cochlear implant postlingual hearing loss seem recruit similar area temporal lobes process speech normal hearing counterpart . The implant recipient activation large diffuse differ greatly describe previously normal hearing . This study provide good comparison hear use bilateral cochlear implant normal unaided hearing . This study provide realistic comparison cortical activation due hear cochlear implantees normal hearing subject . This contrast study involve monaural stimulation unilateral cochlear implant monaural stimulation normal hearing subject contralateral normal hearing ear block . Investigators aware one additional study subject bilateral cochlear implant compare normal hearing control . In addition investigator observe recruitment visual cortex bilaterally implanted subject . This finding also present Strelnikov 's study . However previous work suggest subject cochlear implant rely visual clue process speech result degrade signal provide implant . It possible subject study Strelnikov 's study experience implant user benefit binaural auditory stimulation , dependant audio-visual integration process speech . There increase trend towards hear preservation surgery patient undergo cochlear implantation . Literature support improve speech pitch perception quiet noise subject combine use implant residual preserve natural hearing compare use implant alone . Once underlying mechanism unknown . It would scientific interest investigate interaction natural residual hearing hearing via cochlear implant . It likely cohort subject process speech similarly normal hearing . Finally , study monitor speech progression implantees surgery several year post implant switch . It suggest predominant improvement speech perception occurs first year implant use . This would suggest neuronal network responsible speech processing establish early however , investigator aware study attempt track evolution temporal cortex new recipient cochlear implant .</detailed_description>
