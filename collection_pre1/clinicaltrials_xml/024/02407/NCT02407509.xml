	<brief_summary>RO5126766 administer initially single daily dose 4mg use either twice weekly dosing schedule ( Monday-Thursday ) 3 time per week dosing schedule ( Monday-Wednesday-Friday ) . The daily dose give orally accord dose schedule . A cycle treatment comprise 28 day . In Part I study twice weekly three time per week schedule assess . In absence dose limit toxicity 6 patient recruit dose schedule cohort . In event DLT observe Part I study , single dose reduction 3.2 mg instigate 6 patient recruit dose schedule low dose . The optimal dosing schedule determine Part I take forward Part II 20 patient tumours harbour BRAF , KRAS NRAS mutation enrol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial RO5126766</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre Phase I trial evaluate two intermittent dose schedule . Part I : A total six patient enrol dose schedule base assessment toxicity , PK PD data optimal schedule take forward Part II ( see ) . Patients treat 4-weekly cycle single daily dose 4 mg RO5126766 either twice weekly ( Monday &amp; Thursday ) three time weekly ( Monday , Wednesday Friday ) schedule . Six patient enrol per arm patient receive least one cycle treatment , safety data available PK/PD data review Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) . On basis previous Phase I trial , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) expect dose 4 mg event ≥ 2 DLT 's occurring ( ) 2 x weekly arm , patient recruit arm schedule take forward Part II , ( b ) 3 x weekly arm , single dose reduction 3.2mg dosing schedule implement 6 patient enrol reduce dose . If 4 mg give 3 x weekly consider non-tolerable SRC may decide enrol patient 3.2 mg dose level absence dose limit toxicity . Selection optimum schedule Part I make Safety Review Committee schedule delivers high , tolerable , cumulative weekly dose . Therefore selection follow : - If 2 x weekly ( Mon &amp; Thurs ) 3 x weekly ( Mon , Wed &amp; Fri ) schedule tolerate 4 mg i.e . &lt; 2 DLT 's 6 patient schedule , 3 x weekly schedule select . - If 3 x weekly schedule require dose reduction 3.2 mg 2 x weekly schedule tolerate 4 mg PD data evaluate relative AUC aid selection . - If ≥2 DLT 's occur 6 patient schedule ( despite 3 x weekly arm dose reduce ) , Part II initiate study terminate . Part II : Once optimal dosing schedule establish 20 patient either solid tumour multiple myeloma document KRAS , NRAS BRAF mutation enrol .</detailed_description>
