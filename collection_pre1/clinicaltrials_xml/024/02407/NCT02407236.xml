	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab Induction Maintenance Therapy Participants With Moderately Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , randomize ( assignment study drug chance ) , double-blind ( neither participant study staff know identity study drug ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) , parallel-group ( medical research study compare response 2 group participant receive different intervention ) , multi-center ( one clinical site work medical research study ) , protocol ustekinumab . The protocol consist 2 study : Induction study Maintenance study unique endpoint . Screening period 8 Weeks . Induction study least 8 week duration participant . Participant clinical response Induction study eligible Maintenance study . The Maintenance study 44 week duration . After completion maintenance study , long term extension follow eligible participant additional 3 year . Clinical remission evaluate Week 8 Induction study . Clinical remission among ustekinumab Induction responder evaluate week 44 Maintenance study . Participants ' safety monitor throughout .</detailed_description>
