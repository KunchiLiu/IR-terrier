	<brief_title>Pilot Study Verifying Endotracheal Tube Repositioning Using Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients This prospective , non-randomized observational study conduct Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) Yale-New Haven Hospital . As pilot study determine accuracy precision SonarMed® AirWave™ monitor , investigator base project enrollment population complete study within one year . Intubated patient SICU require ETT reposition identify SICU clinician ( attend physician , resident , respiratory therapist , register nurse ) . Based manufacturer restriction , patient ETTs small 6.5mm large 9mm , double lumen ETTs , patient receive Heliox therapy exclude study . Study Procedures Once patient identify member clinical care team , communicate research team . A member research team verify eligibility study , place sensor monitoring device airway circuit . The monitor place end endotracheal tube , in-line ventilator circuit . Once required distance ETT repositioning prescribed , respiratory therapist move ETT base positioning incisor . This standard practice . The device reading record pre- post-repositioning . The therapist blind device reading . The reading take AirWave monitor research purpose , consider make clinical care decision . Following repositioning , standard practice obtain follow chest X-ray confirmation tube position within two hour window . The head positioning , note original X-ray , maintain follow X-ray . Device reading also take time follow X-ray . If tube reposition base decision SICU team device leave place time tube position fully optimize SICU team . The ETT movement record AirWave™ monitoring device compare position change indicate chest X-ray . Once complete , monitor discontinue remove . For study , additional data record : name , hospital record number , age , height , weight , gender , race , prior medical history , reason SICU admission , reason intubation , complication due mechanical ventilation , day mechanical ventilation ( number day prior reposition procedure total number day ) , length stay , vital sign pre- post-repositioning , include oxygen saturation , FiO2 , peri-procedural vital sign abnormality .</detailed_description>
