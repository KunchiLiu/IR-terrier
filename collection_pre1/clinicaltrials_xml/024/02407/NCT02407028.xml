	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Brain Injury Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical clinical investigation strongly indicate HBO2 physiologically active improve destructive process severe Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) . However , prior definitive efficacy study , important information require regard optimize HBO2 treatment paradigm institute term pressure , frequency whether NBH enhance clinical effectiveness HBO2 treatment . Preclinical investigator work TBI model use pressure vary 1.5 3.0 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) . Clinical investigator use pressure vary 1.5 2.5 ATA . However , lung severe TBI patient frequently compromise direct lung injury and/or acquire ventilator pneumonia susceptible oxygen ( O2 ) toxicity . Working within constraint , essential determine effective HBO2 dose schedule without produce O2 toxicity clinical complication . This propose clinical trial design answer question provide important data plan definitive efficacy trial .</detailed_description>
