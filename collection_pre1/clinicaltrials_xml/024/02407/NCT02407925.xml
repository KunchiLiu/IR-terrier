	<brief_title>Implementation Optical Diagnosis Diminutive Polyps Amongst Endoscopists : Training Long-term Quality Assurance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through recently start nationwide bowel cancer screen programme Netherlands , extra 70.000 colonoscopy annually perform . In current practice , resect colonic lesion histopathologically analyse . Even diminutive polyp , rarely harbour cancer advance histological feature . If endoscopists able accurately differentiate neoplastic non-neoplastic lesion colonoscopy , practice could become efficient costeffective . This strategy call optical diagnosis two clinical practice strategy propose American Society Gastroenterologists ( ASGE ) . First , diminutive polyp could resect discard &gt; 90 % surveillance interval predict optical diagnosis correlate surveillance interval histopathological validation ( assessed high confidence ) . Second , hyperplastic polyp rectosigmoid could leave situ endoscopists able confidently predict neoplastic histology diminutive colorectal polyp negative predictive value ( NPV ) ≥90 % . The accuracy white light colonoscopy acceptable daily practice ( 59 % -84 % ) , narrow band imaging ( NBI ) allow high accuracy 98 % demonstrate experienced endoscopists could reach NPV ≥90 % diminutive colorectal lesion . However , recent research show community gastroenterologist able meet quality threshold propose ASGE . Before strategy could safely apply daily practice , community gastroenterologist able meet threshold well . In study , Dutch gastroenterologists certify perform colonoscopy FIT-positive patient Dutch population screen program , train optical diagnosis validate method . After training , ex- in-vivo test phase lead `` accreditation '' endoscopists observe optical diagnosis 1 year . During year , half endoscopists randomize towards 3-monthly feedback half receive feedback result 1 year . The endoscopic prediction endoscopists polyp histology compare histopathological outcome .</detailed_description>
