	<brief_summary>Problem statement Barrett 's oesophagus pre-cancerous condition affect 375,000 people U.K . There 0.5-3 % yearly risk progress oesophageal cancer , 5 % patient survive 5 year diagnosis . Diagnosing disease stage dysplasia ( pre-cancerous ) early cancer improve survival . This lead current surveillance strategy gastroscopy non-targeted mapping biopsy take Barrett 's oesophagus every two year . The large number biopsy require time consume expensive , yet dysplasia cancerous tissue still miss due non-targeted biopsy sample strategy . Acetic acid use effectively early detection cervical dysplasia cancer , also use success high risk Barrett 's population ( patient suspect dysplasia previously treat dysplasia ) , study low risk Barrett 's surveillance population . A diagnostic study non-targeted mapping biopsy ( current practice ) versus target biopsy ( acetic acid ) surveillance population need widespread adoption technique possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This feasibility study enable powering large study . The investigator would assume disease detection 4.5 % acetic acid chromoendoscopy 1.5 % protocol drive map biopsy . However , assumption largely drive single centre cohort study need clarification could use purpose power study . Based historical cohort study wide consultation within British Society Gastroenterology research committee consultation expert field , estimate 200 patient would reasonable recruitment enable reproducibility generalisability data establish . The purpose study produce statistically significant data establish likely event rate effect size inform power calculation definitive study .</detailed_description>
