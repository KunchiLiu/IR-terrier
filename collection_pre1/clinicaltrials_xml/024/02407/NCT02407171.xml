	<brief_summary>This 2-part prospective trial examine ability Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) induce response MK-3475 , humanize antibody PD-1 , patient progress antibody . Patients metastatic melanoma enrol progressed anti-PD-1 therapy . Patients metastatic NSCLC ( previously untreated anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 therapy ) enrol treated MK-3475 exhibit progression disease . At point ( patient demonstrate progression disease ) single target lesion select treated SBRT , MK-3475 restart continued progression disease . The first phase study radiation dose escalation constant dose MK-3475 . The second part study include expansion cohort NSCLC melanoma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Combination MK-3475 Sterotactic Body Radiotherapy Patients With Metastatic Melanoma NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1b portion trial radiation dose escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SBRT give patient previously subsequently expose MK-3475 . Because class PD-1 inhibitory antibody convey risk pneumonitis , two parallel dose escalation arms- Arm A include SBRT target lung parenchyma , Arm B limit target outside lung parenchyma . Each arm separately escalate , two MTDs determine . The start dose 3000 cGy 5 fraction ; one dose escalation cohort ( 3000 cGy 3 fraction ) , necessary one dose de-escalation cohort ( 1000 cGy single fraction ) . If dose-limiting toxicity low cohort , arm close SBRT site discontinue . The phase 2a portion study include 2 expansion cohort , melanoma NSCLC , SBRT deliver MTD . The primary endpoint phase study overall response rate post-SBRT MK-3475 . Secondary endpoint include determine time progression , overall survival , exploratory biomarkers . IND exempt per FDA .
