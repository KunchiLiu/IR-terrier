	<brief_title>Insufflation Children Undergoing Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several prospective study adult confirm efficacy safety CO2 insufflation comparison atmospheric air insufflation colonoscopy . CO2 insufflation associate decrease post-procedural abdominal pain , likely stem fact , comparison air , absorption CO2 colon much faster due much great water solubility . Animal study also show CO2 insufflation result less disturbance parietal blood flow due potential vasodilating effect . Insufflation colon CO2 prolong procedure lengthen time reach terminal ileum proven safe sedate non-sedated patient . The use CO2 colon insufflation could possibly lead CO2 retention increase level blood thus interfere acid-base balance . However , previous study report carbon dioxide insufflation cause increase CO2 level blood end-tidal CO2 ( ETCO2 ) complication rate increase use CO2 . Because advantage CO2 insufflation become standard care adult colonoscopy . To best knowledge far publish report compare CO2 air insufflation colonoscopy child .</detailed_description>
