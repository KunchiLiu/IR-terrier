	<detailed_description>The Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) group hematopoietic stem cell malignancy include polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) , primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . PV ET evolve myelofibrosis , term post PV/ET MF . ET , PV PMF variable tendency transform blast phase disease dismal prognosis . JAK2V617F point activate mutation result constitutive activity JAK-STAT pathway within hematopoietic cell approximately 96 % , 50 % , 50 % patient PV , ET , MF , respectively . Polycythemia Vera characterize absolute increase red cell mass . Patients PV median survival untreated approximately 18 month time diagnosis treat approximately 18 year . PV-related symptom include headache , weakness , dizziness , epigastric distress , pruritus . PV-related sign include hypertension , gout , leave upper abdominal quadrant pain , high hematocrit , leukocytosis , thrombocytosis . Major cause reduce survival include thrombosis ( 29 % ) , bleed ( 7 % ) , evolution myelofibrosis ( 3 % ) , transformation acute leukemia ( 23 % ) , solid tumor ( 16 % ) . PV patient stratify risk thrombosis age &gt; 60 history prior thrombotic event . Therapy low risk PV include low dose aspirin therapeutic phlebotomy maintain hematocrit &lt; 45 % man 42 % woman . Cardiovascular risk factor modification weight loss , control hypertension hypercholesterolemia , smoke cessation also important adjunctive approach patient PV . High risk patient also treat cytoreductive therapy form hydroxyurea reduce risk thrombotic complication . Essential Thrombocythemia characterize persistent isolated thrombocytosis tendency arterial venous thrombosis . A similar pattern symptom note PV also see patient ET . The median survival patient ET similar age sex match cohort patient limit thrombotic complication ( 22 % ) , evolution MF ( 10 % ) , acute leukemia ( 2 % ) ( Barbui . J Clin Oncol . 2011 ; 29 ( 23 ) :3179 ) . Risk stratification occurrence thrombosis base age &gt; 60 year and/or history thrombosis . Additionally , cardiovascular risk factor persistent thrombocytosis &gt; 1.5 x 109/L believe influence thrombotic risk leukemic transformation show associated anemia , old age , leukocytosis . JAK2V617F present approximately 50 % case help establish diagnosis clonal thrombocytosis , show study predict high risk thrombosis potential transformation PV . Management aim reduce thrombotic risk use low dose aspirin low risk patient ( risk factor ) cytoreductive therapy high risk patient ( least one risk factor ) . Hydroxyurea , anagrelide , interferon ( IFN ) use maintain platelet count 400 x 109/L patient history thrombosis ( secondary prophylaxis ) . Currently , hydroxyurea consider standard care high risk ET patient base result PT-1 study demonstrate superiority hydroxyurea anagrelide arterial thrombosis risk reduction worsen marrow reticulin fibrosis patient receive anagrelide ( Harrison N Engl J Med . 2005 ; 353 ( 1 ) :33 ) . Hydroxyurea associate risk oral skin ulcer , rash , unacceptable myelosuppression sometimes limit use patient ET/PV . Additionally , patient unable achieve adequate control blood count dose 2000 mg/daily term `` resistance '' . Importantly , although theoretical concern leukemogenic potential hydroxyurea exists , base mechanism action chemotherapeutic agent , definitive prospective study clearly document increase risk leukemic transformation . More recently , renew interest interferon-α treatment PV alternative therapeutic approach lead evaluation pegylated interferon-α 2a ( Pegasys , Roche ) several phase II study . Pegasys improved toxicity profile intron-a self-administered patient weekly basis . Currently , Pegasys evaluate two large international trial within myeloproliferative disorder research consortium ( MPD-RC ) . The MPD-RC 111 study phase II study intend evaluate response European LeukemiaNet ( ELN ) criterion patient high risk ET/PV intolerant resistant hydroxyurea therapy treat Pegasys . In addition , patient document JAK2V617F splanchnic vein thrombosis also eligible clinical trial . MPD-RC 112 phase III study newly diagnose high risk PV/ET patient patient randomize either Pegasys hydroxyurea primary endpoint response rate comparison two treatment arm . The use intron-a ( rIFN-α ) Pegasys extensively study patient PV report rate discontinuation first year therapy range 14-40 % . Objective hematologic response see approximately 80 % treated patient achievement complete phlebotomy free state 60 % PV patient . Trials Pegasys treatment PV demonstrate major molecular response 19 % complete eradication JAK2V617F 14-24 % patient . Although hematologic remission often achieve within month start rIFN-α treatment , molecular response require long term administration rarely see completion 12 month therapy . Additionally , sustain molecular remission document patient discontinue therapy 30 month follow . In retrospective review 118 MPN patient receive Pegasys throughout multiple MPN center include 55 PV patient ORR 87 % ( 54 % CR , 33 % PR ) ELN criterion [ 21 ] . In review , common non-hematologic toxicity Grade 1-3 fatigue 24 patient ( 20 % ) , Grade 1 liver function test ( LFT ) elevation 7 ( 6 % ) , Grade 1-2 skin/allergic reaction 6 ( 5 % ) . Adverse effect lead discontinuation primarily non-hematologic , although one patient ( &lt; 1 % ) discontinue Pegasys therapy due Grade 2 anemia . Although biological mechanism recombinant IFN treatment PV completely understand , evidence suggest promotion immunoregulatory cell function , inhibition angiogenesis , induction pro-apoptotic gene expression , alteration bone marrow microenvironment , suppression hematopoietic progenitor cell , increase cycling hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) report . In last several year , oral small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor JAK2 test pre-clinical clinical trial patient MPNs include PV/ET . These agent demonstrate remarkable response term reduction splenomegaly correction leukocytosis , erythrocytosis , thrombocytosis . However , mature follow PV patient treat JAK2 inhibitor evaluate reduction thrombotic risk evolution MF know . Currently , Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) evaluate phase III study patient high risk PV refractory/intolerant hydroxyurea [ Response trial : NCT01243944 ] . The tumor suppressor p53 play integral role regulation cell cycle , apoptosis , DNA repair , senescence . Fifty percent cancer find inactivate mutation p53 . Although , inactivate mutation p53 uncommon chronic phase MPNs , increase frequency blast phase MPNs . The p53 pathway also down-regulated MPN cell express wild-type p53 alternative pathway . Over-expression ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 ( MDM2 ; HDM2 human ) regulator wild type p53 variety different mechanism . MDM2 1 ) promote proteosomal degradation 2 ) inhibits p53 transcription , 3 ) inhibits transactivation 4 ) facilitate export nucleus . Inhibition MDM2 expect release negative regulation p53 ultimately promote tumor suppressor function . MDM2 overexpression consequence gene amplification , increased transcription , increased translation . It previously show primary hematopoietic cell patient JAK2V617F PV , reduce expression p53 result increase La autoantigen expression lead increase translation MDM2 . It would appear JAK2V617F induces ribonucleoprotein furthermore , La protein expression down-regulated vitro JAK2 inhibitor treatment . Lu et al demonstrate increased MDM2 expression reduce p53 level JAK2V617F-positive PV CD34+ cell . The physical structure interaction p53 MDM2 know allow development small molecule inhibitor MDM2-p53 interaction . Nutlin-3 , small molecule antagonist MDM2 , show inhibit proliferation PV CD34+ cell increase p53 mediate apoptosis . Moreover , vitro combination low dose Pegasys nutlin-3 result selective significant inhibition JAK2V67F-positive CD34+ PV colony formation compare normal colony formation . Thus , MDM2 appear novel therapeutic target JAK2V617F-positive PV ultimately may prove effective use combination Pegasys . RG7388 MDM2-p53 bind cell cycle inhibitor ( antiproliferative ) expect myelosuppressive sufficiently high dos . Nonclinical safety finding RG7388 may potential clinical relevance include thrombocytopenia neutropenia , well general pancytopenia , effect liver function parameter . Clinical experience date suggest dose relationship RG7388 gastrointestinal AEs increase incidence nausea , vomit , diarrhea high dose level ; gastrointestinal prophylaxis anti-emetics recommend . Cytopenias , manifest thrombocytopenia neutropenia , occur high dose level appear relate exposure . Iancu-Rubin et al investigate biological effect RG7112 ( first generation MDM2 inhibitor ) induce p53-MDM2 disruption megakaryopoiesis platelet production order well elucidate mechanism treatment associate thrombocytopenia ( ASH 2012 ) . Bone marrow derive CD34+ cell expose RG7112 7 day generate few viable cell , few CFU-MK colony compare untreated cell . Based finding , would appear RG7112 impact megakaryopoiesis two potential mechanism : 1 ) Impairing ability CD34+ cell generate MK precursor due increase apoptosis ; 2 ) Limiting DNA synthesis polyploidization late stage MK development due pharmacological activation p53 . A combination two effect may provide explanation thrombocytopenia observe patient receive drug suggest p53 play important role normal human thrombocytopoiesis . Study NP27872 multi-center , open-label , first-in-human , Phase I dose-escalation study single agent RG7388 , small molecule MDM2 antagonist , administer orally patient advanced malignancy except leukemia . The first patient receive RG7388 15 November 2011 . As 13 September 2012 , 51 patient enrol study . Evaluable PK data available 22 patient Study NP27872 . There evidence significant accumulation ( define mean ratio area curve [ AUC ] τ [ Day 15 5 ] AUCinf [ Day 1 ] &gt; 2 ) observe study thus far , except one patient exhibit long half-life ( t½ ) consequently accumulate drug exposure increase 5-fold Day 1 Day 5 . This possibly due concomitant controlled-release oxycodone , opioids know cause delay gastric empty decreased intestinal motility . In addition , data study demonstrate approximately linear dose-exposure ( Day 1 maximum plasma concentration [ Cmax ] ) relationship RG7388 moderately high inter-patient variability without absorption plateau date . Macrophage inhibitory cytokine ( MIC-1 , secrete protein strongly induce activate p53 ) serum level use assess pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect Phase I study . Analysis patient 100 800 mg/day RG7388 show minimum level p53 induction occur dose 100 mg/day correspond plasma level 500 ng/mL RG7388 . Preliminary analysis PK safety data show apparent PK/PD relationship AUC per cycle Cycle 1 platelet nadir . At data cutoff 13 September 2012 , 51 patient advanced malignancy receive R05503781 Study NP27872 . Fifty patient experience least 1 adverse event ( AE ) 11 patient experience least 1 serious adverse event ( SAE ) . Thirteen SAEs patient ( white blood cell count decrease , platelet count decrease , 2 case neutrophil count decrease , febrile neutropenia , 5 case thrombocytopenia , 2 case neutropenia , diarrhea ) consider investigator probably related study treatment ; 4 SAEs ( 2 case febrile neutropenia , urinary tract infection , anemia ) consider possibly relate ; 1 SAE ( lung infection ) consider remotely relate ; 6 SAEs ( infection , sciatica , non-cardiac chest pain , dyspnea , wrist fracture , neutropenia ) consider unrelated . Three patient die due disease progression . Eleven patient across group schedule least 1 event consider dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) : treatment-related SAE Grade 3 febrile neutropenia , treatment-related SAE Grade 4 febrile neutropenia , treatment-related SAE Grade 4 platelet count decrease , 3 case treatment-related SAEs Grade 4 thrombocytopenia , treatment-related AE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia , 3 case treatment-related AEs Grade 4 thrombocytopenia , treatment-related AE Grade 4 neutropenia , treatment-related SAE Grade 4 neutropenia , treatment-related AE Grade 3 diarrhea , 2 case treatment-related AEs Grade 3 nausea , treatment related AE Grade 3 vomit . Six patient experience 8 AEs lead withdrawal treatment : 1 ( Grade 3 AE cataract ) consider remotely related study treatment , 4 ( Grade 4 AE thrombocytopenia/Grade 3 SAE febrile neutropenia , Grade 2 AE neutropenia , Grade 3 SAE febrile neutropenia ) consider possibly relate study treatment , 3 ( Grade 4 SAE neutropenia , Grade 4 SAE thrombocytopenia/Grade 4 SAE neutrophil count decrease ) consider probably related study treatment . RG7388 representative entirely new branch nutlin family MDM2 antagonists second agent mechanism action sponsor Roche . As lead compound ( RO5045337 ) , RG7388 bind selectively p53 site surface MDM2 molecule vitro high affinity effectively displace p53 MDM2 , lead stabilization accumulation p53 protein activation p53 pathway . RG7388 different chemical series compare lead compound bind high potency selectivity MDM2 protein . This follow-on compound substantially improve pharmacological property . Preclinical model predict superior efficacy RG7388 clinic lower dose exposure . Compared lead molecule , low variability may see give RG7388 significant pH dependent solubility ( fast fed-state simulated intestinal fluid solubility similar ) . RG7388 0.3 μM equivalent apoptotic activity RO5045337 10-fold high ( 3 μM ) concentration 25 mg/kg equivalent efficacy RO5045337 4-fold high dose ( 100 mg/kg ) good potency give weekly . RG7388 exhibit improve vitro vivo potency tumor cell line xenograft , improve CYP inhibition profile , 2.5- 20-fold low project human efficacious dose . Preclinical study indicate tumor express wild-type p53 may respond novel therapeutic strategy release p53 MDM2 inhibition , tumor wild-type p53 MDM2 over-expression amplification likely sensitive . Results preclinical safety toxicology study support exploration compound cancer patient . In view exist unmet medical need advance cancer express molecular signature , RG7388 believe promising agent may offer new therapeutic option . The use Pegasys combination target agent treatment PV/ET would allow administration low dos Pegasys , thereby reduce dose dependent toxicity . Preclinical study Lu et al . demonstrate preferential inhibition PV CD34+ cell proliferation colony formation subtherapeutic dos Pegasys combination Nutlin-3 [ 33 ] . Pegasys increase p53 expression enhance transcriptional activity via p38 Map kinase pathway Nutlin-3 prevents p53 degradation via interruption MDM2-p53 interaction [ 34 ] . Due common downstream target effect increase tumor suppressor p53 expression combination Pegasys Nutlin-3 , low dos agent use together PV patient . Thus , use RG7388 alone combination Pegasys would anticipate enhance p53 expression different mechanism present novel approach treatment PV/ET .</detailed_description>
