	<brief_summary>This project first attempt ass cough airflow dynamic true vocal fold ( TVF ) adduction abduction angle voluntary cough examine effect change glottal closure due reduce mobility one true vocal fold . The hypothesis study incomplete glottal closure due reduce vocal fold mobility result change true vocal fold adductory abductory angle cough result change voluntary cough airflow parameter . This study result contribute exist knowledge laryngeal contribution cough airflow dynamic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cough Reduced True Vocal Fold Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigator consecutively recruit 30 adult diagnose vocal fold insufficiency due reduce mobility one true vocal fold . A questionnaire use collect participant ' information . Demographic information age , gender , race/ethnicity , height , weight , major complaint ( dysphonia and/or dysphagia ) medical history information determine eligibility participation collect participant . Participant 's medical surgical history specifically related diagnosis etiology reduce vocal fold mobility obtain participant 's medical record . Videolaryngoscopy perform part standard clinical care . Vocal fold image cough airflow record simultaneously voluntary cough production flexible endoscope nasopharynx . A second part study include spirometry expiratory muscle strength assessment . Video image vocal fold movement vowel phonation cough production record store CD later analysis . The cough airflow recording display , store , analyze use LabChart software Windows .</detailed_description>
