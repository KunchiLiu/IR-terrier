	<brief_summary>Although soldier must ready respond occupational war theatre demand moment 's notice , epidemic overweight obesity need improve fitness health military . Using cluster randomize clinical trial propose test effectiveness High-Intensity Functional Training ( HIFT ) exercise intervention improve body composition fitness active duty military personnel . The effectiveness HIFT intervention compare usual Army Physical Readiness Training . Main outcomes include change body composition traditional fitness measure , test combat-preparation , measure cardiovascular health risk group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Army Training High Intensity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We examine effectiveness high-intensity functional training ( HIFT ) exercise intervention compare Army Physical Readiness Training ( APRT ) relate dietary instruction improve body composition ( percent body fat [ % BF ] , fat mass , lean body mass , weight ) domains Total Force Fitness ( TFF ; Army Physical Fitness Test [ APFT ] , aerobic capacity , power , strength , combat preparation readiness ) 6-month cluster-randomized clinical trial ( CRCT ) 2 ( +/- 1 ) month follow-up . We also examine effect exercise program cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) health risk ( rest heart rate , blood pressure ) . We conduct assessment baseline , 6-months , 2-month follow-up ( +/- 1 month ) . We also assess train time/volume , injury , adverse event , adherence , participant satisfaction account demographic psychosocial variable . In CRCT , aim recruit randomize approximately 200 soldier ( n=10 clusters—staff groups/platoons—per condition least 10 soldier nest within cluster ) compare effectiveness HIFT versus usual care ( APRT ) : Specific Aim 1 - change body composition include : percent body fat ( % BF ) , fat mass , fat free mass , body weight . We hypothesize soldier HIFT condition significantly likely decrease . % BF b. fat mass , increase c. fat free mass APRT condition ; expect group d. maintain body weight . Specific Aim 2 - change fitness ( e.g. , APFT , power , strength ) , account actual physical training time condition . We hypothesize soldier HIFT condition significantly great improvement performance fitness test compare APRT , despite significantly less total training time . These outcome help determine functional-oriented training result well fitness combat preparedness Army personnel .</detailed_description>
