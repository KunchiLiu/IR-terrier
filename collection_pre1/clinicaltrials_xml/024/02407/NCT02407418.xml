	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect chiropractic low back adjustment thigh muscle strength . Force production measure different type muscle contraction device call isokinetic dynamometer . The study include 21 college-aged subject pain never receive chiropractic treatment spinal manipulation . During two separate session , subject ' thigh muscle force record perform maximal muscle contraction isokinetic dynamometer . Baseline measurement muscle force acquire either treatment form spinal manipulation sham spinal manipulation , follow identical muscle force measurement within five twenty minute post-treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal manipulation therapeutic procedure employ various healthcare practitioner alleviate acute chronic musculoskeletal complaint . This form treatment also deliver enhance performance augment rehabilitation athlete . However , despite research finding allege strength-modulating effect spinal manipulation alongside numerous professional athlete ' positive anecdotal claim concern result , physiological process explain effect remain largely unexplained . Therefore , purpose work investigate effect spinal manipulation college-aged sample population . This study examine effect spinal manipulation deliver lumbosacral region concentric force production knee extensor flexor . A randomized , control , single-blind repeat measure design utilized 21 subject . Isometric isokinetic peak torque ( Nm ) record two separate session subject perform maximal voluntary contraction post-treatment either spinal manipulation sham manipulation .</detailed_description>
