	<detailed_description>Nitroglycerin widely use treatment chest pain suspect cardiac etiology field . While study pre-reperfusion era demonstrate benefit nitroglycerin administration patient myocardial infarction , study establish benefit safety patient STEMI emergency department prehospital setting . It unclear current practice administration nitroglycerin patient suspected cardiac chest pain field benefit . Furthermore , risk patient STEMI establish . The American Heart Association 2010 International Consensus Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Emergency Cardiovascular Care state `` insufficient evidence determine benefit harm initiate nitroglycerin treatment prehospital setting ED . '' By quantify risk nitroglycerin use treatment suspect STEMI field benefit pain relief , one determine continue use medication cardiac chest pain field appropriate . This study conduct Harbor-UCLA Medical Center , UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center , Cedar-Sinai Medical Center . Participants identify emergency department site . There intervention perform . The study limit observational data gathering . Los Angeles County establish regionalized cardiac care 2006 total 34 designate STEMI receive center ( SRC ) throughout county . Harbor-UCLA , UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center , Cedar-Sinai Medical Center designate SRC . As , patient possible STEMI , identify via ECG software interpretation acute MI field , direct center EMS . LA County protocol require paramedic unit contact Base Station patient suspect STEMI . There dedicate mobile intensive care nurse ( MICN ) Base Physician 24-hours per day answer radio , provide on-line medical direction , maintain log patient . Outcome data collect available quality improvement ( QI ) purpose . From 2013 QI data , investigator expect approximately 70 % patient culprit lesion catheterization , confirm STEMI . The MICN research assistant identify study subject . A study investigator review log weekly basis ensure patient miss . Patients eligible enrollment study identify paramedic STEMI transport study site . The patient identify MICN research assistant time base contact arrival hospital prehospital diagnosis STEMI . Patients exclude 18 year age , primary complaint trauma , cardiac arrest time paramedic arrival transport non-study site . The primary outcome frequency hypotension ( SBP &lt; 100 ) initial ED vital sign treatment nitroglycerin suspect STEMI field . The onset action sublingual nitroglycerin 2-5 minute , duration 60 minute . Average transport time LA County approximately 15 minute . Therefore , primary outcome measure upon ED arrival , completion field care prior ED intervention . Secondary outcome change chest pain score patient treat STEMI field in-hospital mortality . Chest pain assess 11-point Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) . The initial pain score assess documented paramedic . The NRS use triage nurse upon ED arrival . A priori , decrease 1.39 consider minimum clinically significant difference ( MCSD ) base prior literature . Planned subgroup analysis outcomes patient require PCI proximal right coronary artery lesion catheterization . After patient arrival , MICN research assistant obtain information pertinent study base hospital form triage encounter , enter data collection form . The following information obtain : patient sequence number medical record number , age , gender , race , initial prehospital vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , pain scale ) , treatment nitroglycerin field ( number dos ) , initial triage vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , pain scale ) , ECG finding ( location ST elevation present ) , disposition cath lab ( yes/no ) . On follow , study investigator enter whether percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) perform , location culprit lesion ( ) patient treat cath lab , final diagnosis disposition patient . This information obtain via chart review discussion cath lab team require . There follow-up patient beyond hospital discharge . During data entry , information maintain SherlockMD , HIPAA-complaint electronic secure database access principal investigator . At study completion , de-identified data export Microsoft Excel spreadsheet ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond WA ) . Statistical analysis perform use SAS 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . The study outcomes present proportion exact binomial confidence interval . P-values univariate association calculate use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . Adjusted outcome estimate determine use multiple logistic regression . A power analysis applicable primary outcome : proportion hypotensive episode related nitroglycerin use STEMI field , comparative group . For secondary outcome pain relief , investigator determine sample size 73 patient per group achieve 90 % power detect minimum clinically significant difference 1.39 , assume , base prior literature , average pain score 6.6 standard deviation 2.58 .</detailed_description>
