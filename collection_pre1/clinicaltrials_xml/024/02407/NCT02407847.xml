Based result hypothesize NPs competent diagnose treat least 75 % complaint show out-of-hours primary care . Substituting GPs NPs out-of-hours care probably lead cost saving . In current study care deliver direct healthcare cost compare different team composition . In experimental condition care provide team NPs GPs . The intervention start team 4 professional experimental ( 3 GPs 1 NP ) control ( 4 GPs ) condition ; consecutive stage extra GP substitute NP aim replace 3 4 GPs NPs . Control : 4 GPs Stage 1 : experimental : 3 GPs &amp; 1 NP Stage 2 : experimental : 2 GPs &amp; 2 NPs Stage 3 : experimental : 1 GP &amp; 3 NPs Both feasibility cost-efficiency lead recommendation optimal balance team GPs NPs .</detailed_description>
