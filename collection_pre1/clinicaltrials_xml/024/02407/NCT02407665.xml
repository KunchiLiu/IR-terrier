	<brief_title>Tai Chi Intervention Brain Imaging Study Among Fibromyalgia Patients Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-four FM patient 24 age match healthy control recruit . All FM patient undergo Tai Chi intervention twice weekly 12 week practice . fMRI rest state brain structure data collect treatment . For healthy control group , fMRI structure data collect , contemporaneous 12 week scan fibromyalgia patient . The primary outcome rsFC rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) , key region descend pain modulatory system ( DPMS ) . The secondary outcome include change cortical thickness change , fibromyalgia symptom severity , widespread pain index , depression , stress/anxiety , sleep quality , quality life . Covariates include age , gender , body mass index , disease duration , depression , comorbidities . Clinical outcome measurement collect baseline 12 week intervention fibromyalgia cohort single visit healthy control . The Tai Chi class teach Tufts Medical Center fMRI scan perform Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center . The project advance science field mind-body medicine chronic pain management , mechanistically clinically .</detailed_description>
