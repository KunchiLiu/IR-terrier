	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct comparative effectiveness evaluation use randomize control trial design adapt Family Model Diabetes Self-Management Education ( DSME ) , compare result Family Model DSME traditional DSME within Marshallese population . The family model cover concept traditional format . However , family model incorporate culturally-adapted education recommendation aim engage family member management primary participant 's diabetes , family member invite fully participate study . By contrast , traditional model provide diabetes self- management education diabetic participant , participant 's family member participate class part study . Biometric survey data collect pre-intervention , post-intervention , 6 month post-intervention , 12 month post-intervention . A qualitative debriefing session hold family final DSME session 6 month post-intervention obtain qualitative data regard participant 's perception intervention implementation process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale The Marshallese population suffers significant disproportionate burden type 2 diabetes . The rate type 2 diabetes among Marshallese one high population group world—at least 400 % high general US population.1-7 Our systematic review local , national , international data found estimate diabetes Marshallese ( population live US Marshall Islands ) range 30 % 50 % compare 8.3 % US population 4 % worldwide.4-7 Causes disparity completely unravel partially embedded history Marshall Islands . Between 1946 1958 , US military test nuclear weapon several Marshall Islands . People inhabit bombed island atoll relocate , Marshallese living nearby atoll evacuate experienced nuclear fallout nuclear test . Because nuclear testing , Atomic Energy Commission list Marshall Islands one contaminate place world , several study demonstrate ongoing health effect nuclear testing.8 The nuclear contamination result significant long-term change diet lifestyle Marshallese.9-12 These change diet lifestyle contribute increased rate type 2 diabetes.2-5,16-19 The Compact Free Association Republic Marshall Islands ( RMI ) US , sign 1986 , permit US conduct military activity Marshall Islands also allow Marshallese individual come US without visa . The Marshallese population live US triple 2000 2010 , Arkansas large population Marshallese living outside RMI . Diabetes self-management education ( DSME ) evidence-based model show improve glycemic control , reduce diabetic complication , reduce cost managing diabetes . Traditional implementation approach DSME effective Marshallese population , indicate unique approach tailor population needed.2-3 Because disproportionate burden diabetes related complication experience high-risk population , novel adaptation evidence-based DSME model subsequent test community-based setting need . Using CBPR approach , conduct four focus group individual interview Marshallese community well understand best address well-established need diabetes education . Through interview focus group , Marshallese participant point delivery method concept self-management individual experience problematic component . DSME design Western societal approach , highly individualistic . The Marshallese highly collectivist culture idea ―self‖ management counter cultural value . As stakeholder describe , ―we eat together one pot . For one person refuse food one pot inconvenient , shameful . It sham person person 's family . It acceptable option . We . The interviewee state change must family change . Incorporating collectivist family concept delivery mechanism imperative . Through interview focus group , Marshallese community suggest DSME implement within family model family group receive DSME entire family benefit patient support effort make lifestyle change . Because ~30-50 % Marshallese community type 2 diabetes , approach could even beneficial . Hypothesis and/or Specific Aims Objectives We hypothesize culturally adapt DSME implement family model result well diabetes management outcome compare traditional DSME Marshallese . In family delivery model , participant encourage invite his/her family member diabetes educational session . As outlined stakeholder , model several potential benefit . First , patient empower invite people define family appropriate take part session . Second , education engage patient-defined support unit . Third , give high-rate diabetes within community , highly probable others within group Type 2 diabetes pre-diabetes may benefit intervention well . Our aim test Family Model DSME use mixed-methods approach . Marshallese participant type 2 diabetes recruit . Those assign family model ask invite one ten adult member family participate DSME . Given ~30-50 % adult Marshallese community type 2 diabetes , Marshallese typically large family , recruitment nontraditional model plausible . Furthermore , method design input CBPR partnership Marshallese . This research highly translational . It help bridge gap knowledge effective DSME intervention actual implementation intervention among Pacific Islander population especially high rate type 2 diabetes significant health disparity .</detailed_description>
