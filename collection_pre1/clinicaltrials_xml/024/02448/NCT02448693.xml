	<brief_title>Study Narrow Band Imaging Characterization Residual Neoplasia After Endoscopic Piecemeal Mucosal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resection large sessile polyp colon ( usually 2 cm ) nonpolypoid neoplastic lesion ( also call laterally spread tumor LST ) , confers technical difficulty often force remove fragmented resection endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection . This associated recurrence 25 % . For reason , clinical guideline recommend endoscopic follow-up 2 6 month piecemeal resection colorectal polyp check residual neoplasia . Narrow-Band Imaging ( NBI , Olympus ) improve visibility identification surface vascular structure colon polyp . In contrast conventional chromoendoscopy , easily activate press button endoscope . Virtual conventional chromoendoscopy apply resection polyp define border lesion . However , study use Narrow Band Imaging allow know whether use technique could improve detection residual tumor fragment polypectomy avoid complication , time cost biopsy histological analysis . In context , European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ESGE ) recently publish first Guideline Advanced Endoscopic Imaging Detection Differentiation Colorectal Neoplasia recommend conventional virtual chromoendoscopy patient piecemeal polypectomy scar ( strong recommendation , low quality evidence ) . The investigator perform randomise , control trial tandem colonoscopy use NBI WLE . The main goal compare rate detect neoplasia technique evaluate diagnostic accuracy NBI WLE histology gold standard .</detailed_description>
