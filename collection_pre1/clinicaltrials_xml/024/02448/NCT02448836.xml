	<detailed_description>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) hormone-dependent mental condition cause significant distress 5 % reproductive age woman worldwide . The disorder recently add diagnostic statistical manual mental disorder ( DSM-5 ) one mood disorder . PMDD characterize affective , cognitive , behavioral , somatic symptom . Treatment possibility limit , 30-40 % patient respond antidepressant oral contraceptive , face alternative effective treatment option . PMDD highly comorbid major depressive disorder ( MDD ) neuroimaging study disorder demonstrate dysfunction dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation ( dTMS ) technique neuromodulation base specific anatomic induction electric field brain . To date , dTMS prove effective treatment tool number mental condition include drug-resistant major depression , onset salutary effect dTMS relatively quick ( compare conventional antidepressant ) . Most clinical trial study effect dTMS major depression , focus stimulate DLPFC . The investigator propose conduct prospective double blind cross-over study , study effect short-term dTMS treatment PMDD patient . The aim study conduct first evaluation deep transcranial magnetic stimulation ( dTMS ) treatment option premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) . The treatment recurrent episodic disorder , effect young , reproductive-age woman , pose significant clinical challenge , current treatment option imply reproductive impairment ( oral contraceptive GnRH ( gonadotropin-releasing hormone ) agonists ) disturb side effect ( e.g . sexual side effect SSRI 's ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) ) . In addition , many 40 % woman PMDD respond conventional antidepressant oral contraceptive , remain without effective tolerable treatment option . The symptom PMDD episodic time-limited , indeed , pharmacological treatment strategy PMDD consist intermittent therapy . Thus , investigator assume dTMS administer 7-14 symptomatic day ( ovulation ) , may provide highly need , tolerable efficient treatment option woman suffer disorder , may actually prevent onset symptom .</detailed_description>
