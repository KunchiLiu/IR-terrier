	<brief_title>Study Palbociclib Trastuzumab With Without Letrozole HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , prospective , open-label , multicentre , Simon 's two-stage-design study combination palbociclib plus trastuzumab , without letrozole , post-menopausal patient HER2-positive locally advanced metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) receive chemotherapy treatment trastuzumab metastatic disease . All patient histologically-confirmed HER2-positive breast adenocarcinoma must receive least 2 ( maximum 4 ) previous line regimen locally advance disease MBC . Patients must radiological evidence progression least one line treatment include trastuzumab locally advance disease MBC . Three patient cohort form basis hormone receptor status treatment assignation . Cohort A include patient ER negative , HER2 positive breast cancer , receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib . Cohort B1 include patient ER positive , HER2 positive breast cancer , receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib . Cohort B2 include patient ER positive , HER2 positive breast cancer , receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib plus letrozole . To avoid imbalance , assignation ERpositive , HER2 positive patient cohort B1 B2 randomise . The concomitant administration trastuzumab plus palbociclib , trastuzumab plus palbociclib plus letrozole studied typical phase I clinical trial . For reason , initial safety phase conduct cohort . The first 6 patient include combination ( 3 patient cohort A , 3 patient cohort B1 6 patient cohort B2 , 12 patient total ) undergo additional cardiac haematological safety monitoring . The inclusion 12 patient do cohort 3 two treatment combination , analogous rate patient inclusion Phase I study classic design . If unexpected toxicity observe end second cycle third include patient , inclusion safety run-in phase continue 3 patient treatment combination arm total 12 patient . After initial phase safety , independent monitoring data committee meet extraordinary way evaluate safety data derive observation 12 patient . If evaluation positive safety regime , recruitment study proceed first stage inclusion completion , inclusion 15 patient arm . The sample size calculate accord Simon 's optimal 2-stage design . The 3 cohort allow early stopping desire efficacy observe stage 1 . Accordingly , 15 patient must include group first stage . If 5 patient few show progression-free survival 6 month , trial stop ( interim efficacy analysis ) . When result interim analysis available , Steering Committee ( SC ) review data ultimately recommend group cohort go stage 2.The Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) evaluate safety data patient include initial safety phase interim safety analysis , give recommendation SC regard continuation study otherwise , basis toxicity data . Inclusion patient continue total 46 patient include , order detect difference 20 % great ( equal 50 % ) PFS 6 month . A treatment regimen consider effective 18 patient total 46 show progression-free survival 6 month ( final analysis ) , reach 80 % power alpha 0.05 level significance . In summary , take account possible scenario 3 cohort , follow total number patient may recruit : Minimum 45 patient ( early stop 3 cohort ) . 76 ( early stop 2 cohort ) . 107 ( early stop one cohort ) . Maximum 138 patient ( 3 cohort go stage 2 ) .</detailed_description>
