	<detailed_description>In 2010 , 7.6 million child age five die worldwide , mainly preventable treatable condition ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . Notably , burden under-five mortality varies dramatically country . The majority child death see Africa ( 3.6 million ) southeast Asia ( 2.1 million death ) , compare 0.16 million 0.28 million under-five death Europe Americas , respectively ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) . In Kenya , 120,000 under-5 death estimate 2010 approximately 35 % death occur neonatal period . A thorough understanding etiology child mortality necessary guide research effort aim tackle important global health problem . Importantly , 2010 , cause 2.7 % ( 0.205 million ) death child age five medically certify ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) , highlight need gather data cause mortality . Prospective longitudinal birth cohort study present opportunity examine temporal relationship early-life exposure ( i.e . prenatal , pregnancy , early postnatal exposure ) multiple health non-health relate outcome include mortality , morbidity , socioeconomic circumstance . It well document exposure occur early life , include genetic , environmental , socioeconomic , lifestyle factor , may long-lasting effect growth , development , health outcome throughout individual 's entire life course ( Lynch &amp; Smith , 2005 ) . Thus , data exposure pregnancy early childhood valuable may provide clue etiology long-term outcome . Additional value gain cross-cohort collaboration comparison ( Larsen et al. , 2013 ) ( Paternoster et al. , 2012 ) ( Brion et al. , 2011 ) . Notably , pool data multiple cohort study , causal inference make great confidence . For example , similar relationship observe across multiple population , distinct set confounding variable , less likely observe association driven confounders . Similarly , cross-cohort comparison enable researcher investigate pattern associate health , social , economic outcome distinct region world . These type analysis may provide valuable insight underlie cause global health inequality . The objective study implement longitudinal prospective birth cohort study Kenya obtain extensive information early-life exposures health non-health relate outcome first year life .</detailed_description>
