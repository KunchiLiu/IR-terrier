	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer metastatic unresectable locally advanced . Histological documentation metastatic/recurrent breast cancer require unequivocal evidence recurrence breast cancer . Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer ( &gt; 10 % staining ) , determine pathology either primary metastatic site ( ) . Central confirmation require . HER2 negative , define 01+ immunohistochemistry FISHnegative ( HER2 copy number &lt; 6 HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt; 2.0 ) . Central confirmation require . Postmenopausal woman eligible . Postmenopausal define follow : Age ≥60 year Age &lt; 60 amenorrhea 12 month ( absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , toremifen , ovarian suppression ) FSH estradiol postmenopausal range per local normal range . Premenopausal woman GnRH agonist least 3 consecutive month prior study entry eligible . Women group MUST remain GnRH agonist duration protocol treatment . Statuspost bilateral oophorectomyAfter adequate heal post surgery . Women , age ≥18 year age . Men exclude . Because dose adverse event data currently available use palbociclib bazedoxifene participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . In addition , breast cancer exceedingly rare individual 18 year age . Participants must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 . See section 11 definition measurable disease . Bone disease lytic lesion also allow treatment response evaluate base MD Anderson criterion . See section 11 . Endocrine resistant breast cancer , define either : Relapsed adjuvant endocrine therapy within 1 year completion adjuvant endocrine therapy Progression least one line endocrine therapy metastatic locally advanced breast cancer . There limit number prior endocrine therapy receive . Patients may receive one prior line chemotherapy metastatic unresectable locally advanced breast cancer . Patients may initiate bisphosphonate therapy prior start protocol therapy . Bisphosphonate therapy may continue protocol treatment . Such patient bone lesion consider evaluable progression Patients must least 2 week prior chemotherapy radiotherapy , investigational drug product , adequate recovery toxicity baseline , grade &lt; 1 , exception alopecia hot flash . There washout period prior endocrine therapy . ECOG Performance Status 01 ( Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 3 month Willingness undergo research biopsy follow circumstance : Patients `` easily accessible disease '' Patients skin chest wall disease amenable punch biopsy local anesthesia require undergo baseline biopsy biopsy time disease progression part protocol . Patients breast mass axillary lymph node amenable imageguided core biopsy also require undergo baseline biopsy biopsy time disease progression part protocol . Patients malignant ascites fluid malignant pleural effusion sufficient volume amenable tap ( either inoffice imageguided ) also require undergo baseline tap tap time disease progression part protocol . Patients undergo research biopsy procedure purpose protocol , inadequate tissue obtain , still eligible require undergo repeat biopsy order enter study . Patients approach cycle 1 provide optional tissue sample time ; however , biopsy optional . Patients `` accessible disease '' Patients sit felt accessible imageguided incisional biopsy opinion patient 's treat oncologist physician performing procedure , meeting criterion `` easily accessible disease '' describe Section 3.1.14.1 , require undergo baseline biopsy part protocol . Such site may include , limited : liver , lymph node , soft tissue , lung , chest wall , bone . Cycle 1 biopsy biopsy time disease progression optional . Biopsies may do local anesthesia intravenous conscious sedation , accord standard institutional guideline . If biopsy require general anesthesia , allow acquisition tissue necessary clinical reason ( i.e . clinically indicate ) , excess tissue would otherwise discard used research purpose . If biopsy require general anesthesia , biopsy site research purpose , without coexist clinical indication allow protocol . Patients undergo research biopsy procedure purpose protocol , inadequate tissue obtain , still eligible require undergo repeat biopsy order enter study . Some patient may clinically indicate biopsy upon recent disease progression . No additional pretreatment biopsy require specimen use correlative study describe protocol . Patients approach time progression provide optional tissue sample time ; however , time progression biopsy optional . Other patient Patients biopsyaccessible disease require undergo biopsy part study participation . In addition , patient treat therapeutic dos anticoagulant ( ) , require undergo biopsy part study participation . If felt clinically appropriate despite anticoagulation ( i.e . skin punch biopsy , etc ) treat physician , biopsy allow , simply require . The site metastatic disease reason disease biopsyaccessible document medical record case report form ( ) . Patients undergo baseline biopsy must study participation approve overall PI start protocol therapy . Only patient biopsy inaccessible disease may enter study without requirement baseline biopsy . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hgb ≥9 mg/dL ( may post transfusion ) Total bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( patient document Gilbert 's disease allow total bilirubin 3X ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit liver metastasis ; ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit liver metastases present . Creatinine ≤ 2X institutional upper limit normal Baseline QTc ≤ 480 ms Ability take oral medication . The effect palbociclib bazedoxifene develop human fetus unknown . If , reason , woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Women make postmenopausal use GNRH agonist , men require use adequate contraception duration protocol treatment 6 month last dose palbociclib bazedoxifene . Adequate contraception define one highly effective nonhormonal form contraception two effective form nonhormonal contraception patient and/or partner . Highly Effective NonHormonal Contraception Methods birth control result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly consider highlyeffective form contraception . The following nonhormonal method contraception acceptable : True abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle patient . [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] . Male sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . For female patient , vasectomized male partner sole partner . OR Effective NonHormonal Contraception Alternatively two follow effective form contraception may use instead : Placement nonhormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Consideration give type device use , high failure rate quote certain type , e.g. , steel copper wire . Condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . The use barrier contraceptive always supplement use spermicide . The following noted : Failure rate indicate , use alone , diaphragm ondom highly effective form contraception . Therefore , use additional spermicide confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection . However , spermicides alone ineffective prevent pregnancy whole ejaculate spill . Therefore , spermicides barrier method contraception use alone . It note two form effective contraception require . A double barrier method acceptable , defined condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/ vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream /suppository . Premenopausal woman GnRH agonist least 3 consecutive month prior study entry eligible . Women group MUST remain GnRH agonist duration protocol treatment . Such patient counsel GnRH agonist alone may adequate contraception adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation employ .
