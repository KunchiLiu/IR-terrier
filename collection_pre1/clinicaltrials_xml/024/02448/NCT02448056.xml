	<detailed_description>Background : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cancer third mortality rate cancer world ( Kamangar et al. , 2006 ) . Treatments hepatocellular carcinoma include surgical resection , local therapy radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , best supportive care ( Bruix Sherman , 2005 ) . For patient candidate surgical intervention local therapy , sorafenib recommend ( Cheng et al. , 2009 ; Llovet et al. , 2008 ) . However , even successful treatment surgical resection , patient suffer recurrence progression tumor ( Bruix Sherman , 2005 ; Llovet et al. , 2002 ; Llovet et al. , 2008 ) . Though several stag system HCC develop , Okuda stag system , AJCC system , BCLC stag system , CLIP score system , prognostic value stag system consistent ( Chen et al. , 2009 ) , applicability stag system depend treatment methodology select . Because shortcoming clinical stag system predict outcome HCC , great interest search serum biomarkers predict prognosis HCC ( Fujiyama et al. , 2002 ; Marrero Lok , 2004 ) . Among , alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) mostly well-studied . AFP use marker diagnose HCC ( Bruix et al. , 2001 ) prognostic factor newly diagnose HCC ( 1998 ) . AFP also value predictive factor chemotherapy response ( Chan et al. , 2009 ) . However , applicability AFP HCC surgical resection tumor local therapy still uncertain . For patient HCC normal serum level AFP , APF could use prognostic factor . Other biomarkers , glipecan-3 , still development ( Marrero Lok , 2004 ) . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) , 17- 25-nucleotide non-coding RNAs , frequently dysregulated cancer emerge novel non-invasive biomarker cancer screening , diagnosis , monitor therapy efficacy predict prognosis ( Wu et al. , 2007 ) . MiRNAs stably expression serum resistance endogenous RNase easily storage high stability ( Aref et al. , 2014 ) . Several study show abnormal expression human serum miRNAs many cancer liver , colorectal , pancreatic cancer ( Huang et al. , 2010 ; Liu et al. , 2012 ; Qi et al. , 2013 ) . The sensitivity miRNA diagnostic biomarker HCC could 80 % ( Yin et al. , 2014 ) . Using miRNA array generate miRNA signature improve sensitivity specificity biomarker tumor diagnosis prognosis prediction . Trial purpose： 1 . To identify serum miRNA diagnosis prediction biomarker HCC . 2 . To correlate expression level miRNA serum , HCC tumor tissue adjacent non-tumor tissue . 3 . To collect store deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) future exploratory research genes/genetic variation may influence response treatment HCC . 4 . To collect store surplus plasma tumor tissue future exploratory research proteins/genes/genetic variation may influence response treatment HCCs . Methods： Study design This prospective study . All patient need provide inform consent . A total 200 patient age &gt; 20 year-old diagnose HCC National Taiwan University Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital enrol . The diagnostic criterion HCC accord 2011 AASLD criterion ( Bruix et al. , 2011 ) . In brief , nodules 1 cm find ultrasound screen cirrhotic liver investigate one dynamic study , either CT scan contrast MRI . If appearance typical HCC ( i.e. , hypervascular washout portal/venous phase ) one technique , lesion would diagnose HCC . If finding characteristic vascular profile coincidental among technique lesion biopsied . For clinical staging , two stag system apply patient , include BCLC stag clinical TNM system . The clinicopathological data collect prospectively . Clinical outcome , include treatment toxicity , treatment response define revise RECIST criterion , disease-progression , overall survival record . Specimen serum collection Blood sample collect 3 time points—pre-treatment , 7 day treatment one month treatment . Blood sample separate plasma mononuclear cell upon collection store -20Ç use . The treatment method include operation , TACE , RFA , PEI , anti-angiogenesis agent include sorafenib use . Tissue collection The HCC tissue ( T ) correspond non-tumor liver tissue ( NT ) obtain . The surgical specimen freeze immediately surgery store -140°C . Viral marker Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) antibody HCV ( anti-HCV ) check use commercially available enzyme link immunosorbant assay kit every patient . For HBsAg positive patient , HBeAg anti-HBe measure enzyme link immunosorbant assay . Serum level HBV DNA measure house TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . For anti-HCV positive patient , HCV RNA measure house TaqMan real-time PCR RNA isolation , reverse transcription miRNA array Blood sample draw EDTA contain tube centrifuge 4,000x g 15 min plasma separation . Plasma transfer clean micro centrifuge tube centrifuge 12,000x g 5 min 200 ul plasma transfer new micro centrifuge tube store -80 _C analysis . RNA isolate use High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) accord manufacturer 's instruction store -80 _C experiment . Reverse transcription reaction For miRNA analysis quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) , 100 ng total RNA reverse-transcribed use TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . All reaction perform specified manufacturer protocol . TaqMan low-density array TLDA analyse identify profile differentially express miRNAs three set sample ( pre-treatment , 7 day post-treatment , one month post treatment ) . In brief , total RNA reverse-transcribed cDNA TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit Megaplex RT set pool A B version 3.0 ( Applied Biosystems ) . The RT product load TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A+B Cards Set v3.0 ( Applied Biosystems ) , enable simultaneous quantitation 667 human miRNAs . TaqMan microRNA assay analysis perform ABI 7900HT Instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . All reaction perform accord standard manufacturer ' protocol . Quantitative miRNA expression data acquire normalized use ABI 7900HT SDS software ( Applied Biosystems ) . Quantitative Real-Time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) Expression miRNA detect via TaqMan low-density array also study well HCC tumor / pair normal liver tissue qRT-PCR analysis describe previously ( Lee et al. , 2011 ) . RNU6B snRNA use endogenous control . Each microRNA assay perform triplicate . Expression microRNAs report delta Ct value ( Ct value RNU6B - Ct value target microRNA ) . The investigator define group tumor cell high low expression base median expression value microRNA . Statistical analysis Overall survival progression-free survival evaluate use Kaplan-Meier 's method . Once specific protein identify proteomic study , patient divide high expression group low expression group , accord median plasma expression level miRNA patient ; survival difference high expression group low expression group analyze use log-rank test . p-value le 0.05 regarded significant .</detailed_description>
