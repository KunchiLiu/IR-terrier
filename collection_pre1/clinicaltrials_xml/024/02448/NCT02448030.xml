	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular exercise adjustment require order redistribute blood flow non-exercising vascular area active muscle . This hemodynamic adjustment , partially mediate mechanosensitive metabosensitive reflex , ultimately increase oxygen nutrient delivery exercise muscle tissue ( Mitchell , 1990 ) . Static handgrip exercise show induce alteration arterial baroreflex function ( Kim , 2005 ) activation muscle metaboreflex increase arterial blood pressure peripheral vasoconstriction , respectively . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) treatment use physical therapy patient unable tolerate conventional exercise show good alternative muscle strengthening ( Sbruzzi , 2010 ) improve metabolic abnormality ( Karavidas , 2006 ) . However , effect FES metaboreflex activation healthy individual never investigate . Therefore , study aim evaluate metaboreflex activation induce FES upper low limb healthy individual , also compare result effect cause isometric exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant invite attend four separate day completion study protocol . On first day , metaboreflex activation upper limb randomly assign isometric exercise FES intervention . On second day , least two day apart , random isometric exercise FES intervention perform upper limb . On third day , least one week apart , participant assign perform metaboreflex lower limb induce isometric exercise FES intervention . On fourth day , least two day apart , random isometric exercise FES intervention perform low limb . To evaluate isometric exercise FES intervention post-exercise ischemia randomly perform evaluate accumulation metabolite response activate limb ( PECO + ) evaluation control without ischemia ( PECO- ) . The experiment PECO+ PECO- separate 30 min interval . During isometric exercise FES protocols blood flow peripheral vascular resistance assess venous occlusion plethysmography . Fatigue determine every minute 10-point Borg scale ass rate perceive exertion blood lactate . Blood lactate evaluate capillary action pre , immediately post exercise 5 minute recovery period . Hemodynamic variable BP HR record every minute protocol .</detailed_description>
