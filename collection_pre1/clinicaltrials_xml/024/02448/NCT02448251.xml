	<brief_summary>AC0010MA new , irreversible , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor . Aim local advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patient EGFR mutation T790M drug-resistant mutation . The molecular mechanism : irreversible combine EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site cell , selectively suppress activity EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation , block signal transduction pathway EGFR inhibit function ras/raf/MAPK downstream , thus block tumor cell growth EGFR induction , promote apoptosis . AC0010MA Maleate Capsules three character : 1 . Irreversible bind EGFR ; 2 . Efficiently suppress tumor cell EGFR mutant suppression EGFR wild-type cell ; 3 . Efficient suppress tumor cell EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation .</brief_summary>
