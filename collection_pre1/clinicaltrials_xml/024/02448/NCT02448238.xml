	<brief_title>Pilot Study Oral Probiotic Bacteria Supplementation Reduce Chronic Immune Activation HIV-infected Malian Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive immune system stimulation , activation , associate inflammation play central role pathogenesis HIV disease . The level T-cell monocyte activation predict rate HIV disease progression AIDS , slope CD4+ T-cell loss , mortality [ Liu 1997 , Liu 1998 , Deeks 2004 , Hunt 2008 , Sandler 2011 ] . The mechanism HIV disease cause persistent immune activation inflammation multifactorial , include direct pathogenic effect replication , chronic viral infection , well indirect pathway . It generally accept bacterial translocation systemic circulation due HIV associate gut change important part pathology . Both HIV simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection result rapid profound depletion gut mucosal Th17+CD4+ T-cells , key immune cell associate reduce bacterial translocation gut wall [ Brenchley 2004 , Raffetellu 2008 ] . In addition , HIV SIV cause direct damage intestinal epithelial cell [ Li 2008 , Nazli 2010 ] , gene expression study GI mucosa reveal HIV-associated upregulation gene involve inflammatory apoptotic pathway downregulation tight junction [ Sankaran 2008 ] . These HIV-associated gut change ultimately disrupt normal synergistic co-existence man his/her commensal gut microbial flora , result increase translocation gut bacterial product endotoxin ( also know lipopolysaccharide ) bacterial 16 ribosomal DNA systemic circulation . Here , bacterial product serve potent stimulus sustain T-cell monocyte activation inflammation drive HIV disease progression [ Hunt 2008 , Brenchley 2006 , Jiang 2009 ] . Treating HIV antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) partially correct gut lesion relate inflammatory process . One possible approach address problem replenish `` ecological niche '' gut beneficial bacteria `` probiotic '' Lactobacillus Bifidobacillus specie , may deplete HIV infected person certain condition . Probiotic bacteria biofilms show stimulate innate immunity result beneficial metabolic change improve gut epithelial barrier Th17 T-cell function reduce gut inflammation endotoxin leak [ Bassaganya-Rievra 2012 , Pagnini 2009 , Giamarellos-Bourboulis 2009 ] . This proven beneficial several clinical setting include ulcerative colitis , illeal pouch inflammation , acute diarrhea child [ Tursi 2010 , Miele 2009 , Minmura 2004 , Salari 2012 ] . In HIV infected individual , patient treat ART fail attain expect improvement blood CD4+ T-cell count seem lack measureable plasma 16 ribosomal DNA signature Lactobacillus specie lower fecal concentration lactobacillus [ Merlini 2011 , Perez-Santiago 2013 ] . Primate SIV model use pigtail macaque demonstrate Lactobacillus plantarum supplementation enhances gut Th17 CD4 recruitment , interleukin ( IL ) -17 expression , epithelial tight junction protein production , decrease inflammatory chemokines IL-1B [ Sankaran 2013 ] . Another recent study demonstrate SIV infect macaque significantly improve number gut antigen present cell mucosal CD4+ T-cells , reduce gut lymphoid tissue fibrosis , reduce plasma d-dimer level give ART combination probiotic bacteria ( VSL # 3 L. rhamnosus CG ) vs ART alone [ Klatt 2013 ] . Thus , probiotic could offer important benefit HIV-infected patient improve intestinal mucosal immunologic function reduce subsequent bacterial translocation immune activation lead AIDS . A limited number study look probiotic reduce diarrhea improve CD4+ T-cell count HIV infected individual , particularly Africa . Individuals sub-Sahara Africa likely diarrhea develop country gut microbiome different [ Yatsunenko 2012 ] , great burden intestinal parasitosis pathogenic bacteria Salmonella Cholera . Some data suggest non-HIV-infected individual ( African descent compare Caucasians , woman compare men ) may great intestinal permeability display pronounce systemic inflammatory response . A study 24 HIV-infected Nigerian woman ( CD4+ T-cell count &gt; 200 , ART ) diarrhea randomize receive 15 day yogurt without probiotic ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus CG L. reuteri ) . The probiotic group resolution diarrhea stable improve CD4+ T-cell count one month compare unsupplemented yogurt [ Anukam 2008 ] . Similar CD4 improvement observe randomize probiotic ( Bifidobacterium bifidum Streptococcus thermophilus ) study HIV infect African child [ Trois 2008 ] . An observational study examine introduction probiotic yogurt , make local HIV infect woman low-income community Tanzania , associate significantly increase CD4+ T-cell count [ Irvine 2010 ] . Probiotics proven safe well tolerate [ Irvine 2011 , Kerac 2009 , Hummelen 2011 , Wolf 1998 ] study HIV infect individual . Rationale Probiotic Bacteria Selection Safety - All Lactobacillus sp . probiotic bacteria may perform equally well restore gut mucosal integrity immune function safe fashion . VSL # 3® DS ( Double-Strength , Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals ) well characterized water soluble , live ( 9 × 1011 bacteria/sachet , daily ) , lyophilize preparation 8 probiotic bacterium , lack L. rhamnosus include previously discuss L. plantarum S. thermophilus ( along Bifidobacterium breve , Bifidobacterium longum , Bifidobacterium infantis , Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus paracasei , Lactobacillus bulgaricus ) study extensively , 140 PubMed citation since 1999 . VSL # 3 show vitro vivo ( rat model ) increase tight junction protein , reduce intestinal permeability , reduce inflammation , enhance innate immunity , reduce salmonella invasion [ Dai 2012 , Mencarelli 2012 , Appleyard 2011 , Madsen 2001 , Pagnini 2010 , Gad 2011 ] . L. paracasei contain within VSL # 3 encodes `` lactocepin '' protease selectively degrade secreted cell-associated chemokines reduce inflammation murine colitis model [ von Schillde 2102 ] . As previously note , SIV infect macaque improve number gut antigen present cell mucosal CD4+ T-cells give VSL # 3 L. rhamnosus vs ART alone [ Klatt 2013 ] . Clinically , VSL # 3 study extensively `` pouchitis '' , may occur follow ileal pouch-anal anastomosis chronic ulcerative colitis approximately 30 % patient . Several randomized clinical trial Cochrane database review support safety efficacy VSL # 3 reduce acute chronic pouch inflammation [ Holubar 2010 ] . VSL # 3® DS probiotic recognize effective tool management pouchitis American College Gastroenterology well German Association Gastroenterology . Similarly , VSL # 3 effective adjunct relapse mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study [ Tursi 2010 ] . In randomized trial 59 child irritable bowel syndrome , VSL # 3 superior placebo reduce abdominal pain/discomfort bloat [ Guandalini 2010 ] . A double-blind , randomize clinical trial 229 risk hospitalize patient demonstrated VSL # 3 could prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea [ Selinger 2013 ] . VSL # 3 study healthy , pregnant Italian woman , cirrhotic patient , critically ill patient safety issue [ Vitali 2012 , Agrwal 2012 , Gupta N 2013 , Frohmader 2010 ] . As previously note , medical literature identifies rare case lactobacillus bifidobacillus bacteremia ( associate VSL # 3 ) , generally severely immune compromised patient nosocomial , central line associate infection person take probiotic . An 8 year retrospective study large U.S. academic medical center find maximum 0.2 % probiotic bacteremia incidence among hospitalized probiotic recipient [ Simkins 2013 ] . An extensive review U.S. Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) complete 2011 387 case series randomize controlled trial involve 24,000 patient find case use product include Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , Saccharomyces , Streptococcus , Enterococcus , Bacillus lead hospital admission [ Hempel 2011 ] . Evidence hospital admission bacteremias due probiotic use come case report rare . The DHHS study find evidence increase adverse effect associate probiotic use add `` rare adverse event difficult assess , despite substantial number publication , current literature well equip answer question safety probiotic intervention confidence '' . An independent panel food safety expert conclude VSL # 3® `` Generally Recognized As Safe ( GRAS ) medical food use . '' GRAS U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) designation acknowledge certain food additive safe condition intend use qualified expert . To receive recognition , product must establish consensus expert opinion regard safety use base review scientific evidence . Rationale Single Arm Design - The hypothesis test oral probiotic bacteria supplementation reduce endotoxemia endotoxin-associated macrophage T-cell activation HIV-infected subject . Because expect endotoxin macrophage/T-cell activation level remain stable ( perhaps slowly increase ) subject receive ART [ Deeks 2004 ] , single arm study allow u determine whether intervention effect . In study , individual CD4+ T-cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3 enrol . Among person CD4+ T-cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3 , rate AIDS non-AIDS event 0.7 event per 100 person-years [ Baker 2008 ] , investigator expect complication unlikely study . Recently , WHO guideline change recommend start ART HIV infect individual 's CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 likely subject would recommend ART . However , ART availability currently limited region many potential subject could participate time ART broadly available . Subjects plan initiate ART within study duration 24 week enrol . STUDY DESIGN - This single arm study evaluate effect 12 week combination oral probiotic supplementation ( VSL # 3 ) biomarkers microbial translocation , monocyte T-cell activation , inflammation blood chronically HIV-infected Malian woman subject CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 receive ART . Subjects re-evaluated week 24 determine sustainability change . This study enroll 50 subject . Blood plasma/serum fecal sample occur baseline , 4 , 12 , 24 week . All subject examine intestinal parasite within 45 day study entry . Detailed demographic , weight BMI , stool frequency , symptom , ART history , CD4 HIV RNA record . A stress assessment questionnaire complete baseline week 12</detailed_description>
