	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study Active Specific Immunotherapy With OncoVax® Patients With Stage II Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OncoVAX active specific immunotherapeutic ( ASI ) stimulate patient 's immune response autologous ( patient-specific ) tumor cell . It comprise sterile , live non-dividing tumor cell obtain follow standard-of-care surgical tumor resection Stage II colon cancer . Within 35 day follow surgery , patient immunize OncoVAX prevent disease recurrence , incurable occurs 35 % patient . Patients give three vaccination per week three week , follow booster vaccination six month . A previously complete Phase III trial publish The Lancet show OncoVAX cut risk recurrence 61 % patient Stage II colon cancer . The primary endpoint Disease-Free Survival : defined time curative surgery objective test confirm tumor recurrence death due cause . The secondary endpoint Overall Survival Recurrence-Free-Interval . An interim analysis perform significance level 0.005 2/3 anticipated event occur , result significance level 0.0483 end study . A total 550 patient plan , randomize 1:1 receive OncoVAX® plus surgery ( n=275 ) surgery alone ( n=275 ) .</detailed_description>
