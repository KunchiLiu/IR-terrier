	<brief_summary>The study test novel demand generation strategy , `` Stylish Man/Stylish Living '' , increase uptake Combined HIV Prevention ( CHP ) Rakai , Uganda . CHP include evidence-based intervention , include safe voluntary medical male circumcision ( VMC ) , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , prevention mother child transmission ( p-MTCT ) behavioral intervention . With President 's Emergency Fund AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) fund , Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) provide CHP Rakai District , Uganda . Our ongoing 54 village Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) , community HIV prevalence range 6 % 42 % , provide longitudinal data rate CHP coverage HIV incidence . The investigator preliminary evidence CHP reduce HIV incidence Rakai , coverage remain suboptimal ( elsewhere Africa ) , particularly men , reduce program impact . Our data suggest CHP supply limit factor , `` deficit demand '' . Based extensive qualitative research , investigator develop piloted innovative male-focused CHP demand generation strategy , `` Stylish Man/Stylish Living Program '' ( SMLP ) male-friendly without exclude exclude woman . The SMLP strive `` demedicalize '' CHP deemphasizing health-focused message instead stress `` take charge life '' . The SMP two distinct related element : ( 1 ) mass medium ( MM ) via radio poster ; ( 2 ) community-level mobilization via `` Stylish Man/Stylish Living Event '' ( SMLEvent ) include multimedia medium ( Stylish Van , video , music , health promoter ) investigator embed CHP promotion , immediate access service . In study , investigator conduct 3 year cluster randomize trial MM plus SMLEvents ( intervention arm ) compare MM alone ( control ) , 25 RCCS community per arm aggregate ~10 cluster per arm ( 50 community ) . The primary outcome intent-to-treat community-level rate CHP coverage arm . The investigator also monitor rate key behavior HIV incidence , compare arm rate observe community arm prior study initiation ( secondary outcome ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Demand Generation ( Stylish Man , Stylshs Living ) HIV Prevention/Family Planning Services , Rakai , Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment strategy : We propose pragmatic cluster-randomized trial effect MM+SMLEvent ( intervention ) versus MM alone ( control ) CHP coverage . In addition , RCCS data trial initiation provide data trend CHP coverage , HIV incidence key behavior arm trial . In trial control community provide assessment effect mass medium alone . The `` pragmatic '' approach allow modification SMLP component base feedback iterative assessment , would case normal program practice . Cluster randomize trial component : - 50 Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) community divide ~20 cluster 2-3 village close geographic proximity per arm . The total population 50 community ~18,000 , estimate approximatley 15,000 interview via RCCS component intervention evaluation . The cluster stratify community characteristic ( e.g. , fishing village , main road hub , agrarian village ) , randomize within stratum . Intervention arm : ~ ten cluster randomly assign receive SMLEvent activity annually 3 year addition ongoing district-wide MM . The SMLEvents include community mobilization describe , carry conjunction mobile service camp conduct time SMEvent . The ~10 cluster ( control arm ) expose MM 3 year , receive SMLEvents . All control community receive CHP service via RHSP/MOH mobile clinic conduct annually conjunction RCCS survey round . Both intervention control arm cluster continue year-round access exist MOH/RHSP clinic CHP service . Services arm offer per Uganda CDC PEPFAR guideline . Both arm thus equivalent access CHP . Pre-post component : The MM campaign radio cover large proportion population Rakai randomize . However , RCCS provide longitudinal information population-level rate HIV care/ART , VMC p-MTCT coverage since service introduce ( 7+ year ) , well data behavior ( condom use , number partner , etc… ) HIV incidence , since 1994 . Thus , within control arm community , data require determine proportion population expose mass medium , whether MM associate increased demand among population subgroup . The rate service uptake RCCS essentially plateaued past 3 RCCS round , upward inflection follow MM startup suggest program effect . We also conduct pre-post comparison SMEvent+MM arm . As described , add question RCCS enhance SMP evaluation . CHP use also validate service statistic : since RHSP/MOH collaboration primary provider SMC RCCS community , RHSP monitor ART clinic RCCS community , work MOH antenatal care clinic p-MTCT , robust triangulate survey service data ass use CHP . Methods data collection : 1 . Annual RCCS community surveillance survey , among consent individual age 15-49 50 RCCS community ( aggregated 10 cluster per trial arm ) . The RCCS continue collect detail data sociodemographics , behavior ( include number types partner , condom use , whether partner within community another geographic setting ) , egocentric sexual network , pregnancy since last RCCS survey round , health status use HCT , condom , ART , P-MTCT , VMC . We add module RCCS evaluate exposure SMLP ( mass medium , SMLEvent ) , perception component SMLP ( positive negative ) , perception different CHP service degree acceptable within respondent 's family , peer group community ; whether respondent conversation partner , family and/or peer CHP service ; whether individual accept service adopt self-reported behavioral change result campaign , , ( ) main influence ( ) ( i.e. , information , find peer use service , friends spouse encourage uptake result campaign , easy access service , etc….. ) The report utilization validate clinic data . HIV test conduct RCCS survey round , use three rapid test algorithm , EIA and/or PCR confirmation newly identify HIV+ in-migrants new seroconverters . Serum sample RCCS archive -800C future study community viral load , future grant . Women ask pregnancy status ; uncertain offer urinary hCG pregnancy test ( offer routinely RCCS ) . Pregnant HIV+ woman refer p-MTCT . Since RCCS routinely collect serum HIV test CD4 , track HIV incidence , immunologic status RCCS , complement clinic-based evaluation describe . 2 . Process data : Records keep SMLP activity : radio spot interview , schedule SMLEvent activity , etc . SMLEvent process data include estimate number participant day , photo take assist count . Approximately 12 short anonymous `` spot interview '' conduct daily SML Event site daily young old men woman , gauge interest activity , positive negative perception , suggestion improvement . 3 . Clinic-based evaluation : Both mobile SMLEvent service RHSP/Ministry Health ( MOH ) clinic , record keep service referral provide , client 's age , gender , venue date . ( Client medical record include individual 's name , retain separately research record . ) Clients ask motivated accept service ( SMLP component , people get service , encouragement someone influence SMLP , factor unrelated SMLP , etc… ) We track whether person refer HIV care/ART present HIV clinic ( conversely , ask clinic attendance RCCS survey round ) . Routine HIV clinic data collection include track visit , question adherence , CD4 cell count every 6 month . PEPFAR currently fund HIV viral load , sample RHSP/MOH clinic test viral load annually INternational Center Excellence Research ( ICER ) fund . These data complement RCCS data , provide comprehensive indication ART coverage long term treatment outcome . Cost data : We propose formal cost benefit analysis . However , cost campaign closely track ( cost radio spot , personnel/materials SMEvent , fuel , administrative support cost , additional cost PEPFAR extend even service hour , etc… ) . The focus service-related cost , research outlay track separately . We compare overall cost per unit ART , VMC p-MTCT coverage , intervention versus control arm relation PEPFAR cost per client date .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Please note : question ( `` accept health volunteer '' ) really applicable community randomize trial . We enrol anyone trial , test individual level intervention : definition , community member expose message radio poster , anyone come Stylish Man/Stylish Living event . We interview approximately 15,000 person study community exposure Stylish Program regarding use CHP service , part ongoing , longitudinal Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) , already ask use CHP service since first introduce , start approximately 2004 . However , interview RCCS way dependent expose Stylish Program . Residents age 1849 year 50 community . ( Please note : communityrandomized trial ) All community resident may attend event definition , expose mass medium . However , person age 1849 sign fingerprint write informed consent interview RCCS part evaluation nest within RCCS .</criteria>
