	<brief_summary>Patients suffer metabolic myopathy Glycogen Storage Disease type IIIa ( GSDIIIa ) problem release sugar store cell need energy production . This cause several systemic impairment , recently exercise-related symptom muscle examine . A previous study show sign intravenous infusion glucose relief symptom . The purpose study investigate randomize placebo-controlled fashion whether oral ingestion sugar alleviate muscular symptom patient GSDIIIa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Supplements Improve Exercise Tolerance Metabolic Myopathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It recently document patient GSDIIIa moderate severely reduce exercise capacity , exercise induces muscle pain cramp . These symptom cause inability mobilize skeletal muscle glycogen likely consequence severe energy deficiency within muscle . The study change phenotype GSDIIIa , include exercise-induced symptom , typical presentation metabolic myopathy . It also document exercise capacity significantly improve exercise-induced muscular symptom relieve intravenous glucose infusion . Based finding , study wish investigate oral ingestion sucrose effect work capacity large number patient , randomize , placebo-controlled , cross-over setup . Ingestion sucrose potential effective , cheap easily accessible dietary treatment muscular symptom GSDIIIa .</detailed_description>
