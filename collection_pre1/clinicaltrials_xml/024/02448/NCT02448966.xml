	<brief_summary>Esophageal carcinoma aggressive malignancy poor prognosis . Surgical resection remain effective method malignant disease . VATS esophagectomy become popular China around world . Although VATS esophagectomy proven effective prevent respiratory complication , still ample evidence demonstrate VATS esophagectomy effective traditional three-incision esophagectomy lymph node dissection equal superior long-term survival . The purpose large scale prospective observational study compare minimally invasive thorascopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy traditional three-incision esophagectomy lymph node dissection , postoperative recovery , postoperative complication , long-term survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Traditional Three-incision Esophagectomy Versus Minimally Invasive Thorascopic Laparoscopic Esophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal carcinoma aggressive malignancy poor prognosis , For patient , radical esophagectomy cornerstone multimodality treatment curative intent . Transthoracic esophagectomy prefer surgical approach worldwide allow en-bloc resection tumor . However , percentage cardiopulmonary complication associate traditional three-incision esophagectomy high.Recent study show minimally invasive thorascopic laparoscopic esophagectomy least equivalent open transthoracic approach esophageal cancer term short-term oncological outcome , include reduce blood loss , short ICU stay , low pulmonary complication rate , evidence ample sample size enough.The objective study compare efficacy , perioperative complication , lymph node dissection long term survival thoracic esophageal cancer patient treat minimally invasive thorascopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy open transthoracic esophagectomy three incision .</detailed_description>
