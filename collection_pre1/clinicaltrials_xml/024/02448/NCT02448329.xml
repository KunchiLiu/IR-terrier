	<brief_summary>This study single arm , single center phase II study AZD1775 combination paclitaxel patient advance gastric adenocarcinoma harbor TP53 mutation second-line chemotherapy . Patients receive AZD 1775 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen . The arm compose 25 patient . AZD1775 225 mg BID q 12 hour ( x 5 dos ) administer day 1~3 + paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 give day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle . Tumour evaluation use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 conduct screen every 16 week objective disease progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AZD1775 inhibitor Wee1 , protein tyrosine kinase . Wee1 phosphorylates inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) 2 ( CDK2 ) , involve regulation intra-S G2 cell cycle checkpoint . In vitro vivo preclinical model , AZD1775 selectively enhance chemotherapy induce death cell deficient p53 signal . Tumor context-specific sensitization DNA damaging agent gemcitabine platinum observe TOV21G ( ovarian carcinoma ) cell line match wild type knock p53 .</detailed_description>
