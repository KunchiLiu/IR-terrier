	<brief_summary>Background . During clinical course patient locoregionally advance non-small-cell lung cancer ( LA-NSCLC ) undergone aggressive treatment , brain metastasis ( BM ) frequent see pattern disease relapse , ignore . It still remain unresolved whether prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) via whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) recommend NSCLC patient stage III pathologically nodal positive disease . Actually , PCI would significantly decrease incidence BM ; however , potential WBRT-related neurocognitive function ( NCF ) sequelae indeed concern , make PCI seldom apply clinical practice . In term time course WBRT-induced NCF decline , might vary considerably accord specific domain select measure . Early neurocognitive decline principally involve impairment episodic memory , significantly associate function hippocampus . This study thus aim explore impact PCI subsequent risk develop BM multi-domain neurobehavioral function eligible patient . Methods . Potentially eligible subject postoperative NSCLC patient status pathologically nodal metastasis ( pN+ ) . Patients randomly assign PCI arm undergo course hippocampal-sparing PCI complete fourth course adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy . Radiotherapy dose 3000 cGy 15 fraction three week . Except administration hippocampal-sparing PCI , patient assign observation arm receive baseline follow-up brain imaging examination neurocognitive assessment PCI arm . Accordingly , battery neuropsychological measure , include 7 standardized neuropsychological test ( e.g. , executive function , verbal &amp; non-verbal memory , work memory , psychomotor speed ) , use evaluate neurobehavioral function register patient . Expected result . This randomize control study aim verify incidence BM still significantly reduce hippocampal-sparing PCI ; additionally , NCF preservation regard neurobehavioral assessment might also achieve hippocampal-sparing PCI compare observation arm without PCI . No matter final result present , believe randomize control trial ( RCT ) provide u solid evidence concern exact value hippocampal-sparing PCI patient setting .</brief_summary>
