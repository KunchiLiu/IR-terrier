	<detailed_description>Up 6 ascending , single dose cohort plan dose sequential manner Part 1 study . Eight subject treat single dose study drug per dose cohort ( 6 subject per cohort receive BCX7353 2 subject per cohort receive match placebo ) . Escalation next high dose level occur completion review clinical safety pharmacokinetics Sponsor PI . Up 4 ascending , multiple dose cohort enrol sequential manner Part 2 study . Twelve subject treat study drug per dose cohort ( 10 subject receive BCX7353 2 subject receive placebo per cohort ) . The planned dos , dose regimen , duration dosing ( 7 14 day ) Part 2 cohort determine base upon safety pharmacokinetic data collect study . Escalation next high dose level Part 2 occur completion review clinical safety pharmacokinetics Sponsor clinical site study physician . In Part 3 study , safety , tolerability , PK , PD single multiple dose oral BCX7353 versus placebo healthy subject Japanese origin evaluate . In single dose cohort , 16 Japanese subject randomize single cohort receive either placebo 1 2 active dos BCX7353 . In multiple dose cohort , twelve subject treat study drug ( 10 subject receive BCX7353 2 subject receive placebo per cohort ) .
