	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare lymph node dissection result prognosis thoracic esophageal carcinoma patient without cervical lymph node involvement preoperative CT and/or ultrasound treat two-field lymphadenectomy three-field lymphadenectomy.Another purpose study clarify whether lymph node along right recurrent laryngeal nerve take sentinel lymph node able indicate neck lymph node metastasis necessity three-field lymphadenectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two-field Versus Three-field Lymphadenectomy Thoracic Esophageal Carcinoma Without Cervical Lymph Node Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal carcinoma prevalent aggressive malignant disease poor prognosis China . Complete surgical resection systemic lymph node dissection remain effective treatment method malignancy . Although tree-field lymph node dissection report effective improve long-term survival Japan , enough evidence yet demonstrate three field lymph node dissection superior two field lymph node dissection reduce postoperative recurrence improve long-term survival . In study , dissection lymph node adjacent right recurrent laryngeal nerve would perform examined routinely intraoperative frozen-section . If lymph node positive , three field lymph node dissection ( Cervical-thoracic-upper abdominal lymphadenectomy ) perform , negative , patient randomly assign either three-field lymphadenectomy group two-field lymphadenectomy group . The purpose large scale multi-center trial compare lymph node dissection result prognosis thoracic esophageal carcinoma without cervical lymph node involvement treat three-field lymphadenectomy two-field lymphadenectomy clarify whether lymph node along right recurrent laryngeal nerve could take sentinel lymph node indicate neck lymph node metastasis necessity three-field lymphadenectomy .</detailed_description>
