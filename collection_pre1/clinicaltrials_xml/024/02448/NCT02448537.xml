	<brief_title>A Phase II Multi-Strata Study PM01183 Single Agent Combination With Conventional Chemotherapy Metastatic and/or Unresectable Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . PM01183 new drug believe bind DNA cause double strand DNA break . This drug study previous research study , suggest may slow stop growth cancer . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve PM01183 treatment disease . In research study , investigator try assess effect , good bad , PM01183 , administer either alone combination gemcitabine doxorubicin metastatic unresectable sarcoma .</detailed_description>
