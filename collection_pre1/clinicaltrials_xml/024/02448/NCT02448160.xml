	<detailed_description>The study single centre , open-label trial . The patient diagnosis refractory ascites meet specified inclusion/exclusion criterion Informed consent obtain patient . All patient alfapump surgically insert addition receive 8g salt-poor Human Albumin Solution ( 20 % ) per 1 litre Ascites drain . This Intravenous administration intermittent ( every 2 week ) take place day patient . Patients also receive standard care , may include , limited , administration diuretic , paracentesis consideration orthotopic liver transplantation . The primary objective study ass whether intermittent human albumin replacement accordance large volume paracentesis guideline ( 8g/L ascites drain ) prevent development renal dysfunction 3-month assessment . This would potentially guide clinical use alfapump system . The secondary objective study address objective previous alfa pump study /sub study , allow comparison propose study data generate previous study . These measure 1-month 3-month time point .</detailed_description>
