	<brief_summary>This clinical trial compare fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 ( 18F-FSPG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) standard care fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 ( 18F-FDG ) PET/CT image patient newly diagnose lung cancer indeterminate pulmonary nodule . PET/CT use radioactive glutamate ( one common building block protein ) call 18F-FSPG may able recognize difference tumor healthy tissue . Since tumor cell grow , need make protein , building block , cell growth make glutamate molecule . PET/CT use radioactive glutamate may effective method diagnose lung cancer standard PET/CT use radioactive glucose ( sugar ) , 18F-FDG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare image characteristic 18F-FSPG PET/CT standard-of-care , 18F-FDG PET/CT . II . To compare image characteristic 18F-FSPG PET/CT standard-of-care 18F-FDG PET/CT patient newly diagnose lung cancer . III . To determine whether 18F-FSPG uptake lung cancer predict base correlation CD44 amino acid transport system xc- ( xC- ) expression surgical pathology specimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scan per standard care . Within 15 work day , patient also undergo 18F-FSPG PET scan 60 minute follow 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan 30 minute . After completion study , patient follow 2 year need diagnosis .</detailed_description>
