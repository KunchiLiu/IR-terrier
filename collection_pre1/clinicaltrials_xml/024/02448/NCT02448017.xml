	<brief_summary>Herbst appliance one popular fix functional appliance treat orthodontic patient small low jaw . Since small low jaw report one main reason induce sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) child , Herbst appliance use treat SDB child . Previously study compare effect Herbst appliance therapy removable functional appliance airway dimension , still remain unclear kind functional appliance suitable improve airway dimension . This study assess effect Herbst appliance airway dimension compare effect twin block appliance ( popular 24 hour use removable functional appliance , also commonly use treat adult sleep apnea ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Herbst Appliance Therapy Improve Airway Dimension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) important paediatric problem . It estimate 3.2 % 12.1 % child habitual snore 0.7 % 10.3 % obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) . Children OSAS associate series daytime nighttime sign symptom . Nighttime symptom include heavy snoring , restless sleep , heavy seating enuresis , etc . Daytime symptom include excessive daytime sleepiness abnormal behavior aggressiveness hyperactivity , etc . Untreated OSAS report result serious morbidity , failure thrive , poor learning , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , etc . There increase concern relate sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) child orthodontists . Since tonsilar adenoid hypertrophy main cause paediatric OSA , also craniofacial anomaly retrognathic mandible , narrow maxillary palatal arch increase low facial height also contribute , orthopedic treatment rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) mandibular advancement device ( MAD ) may potentially permanently cure child OSA . RME use widen maxilla , thus increase nasal cavity improve nasal flow , thoroughly research . However , previous study focus treatment effect MAD treat OSA child . These study show sort MAD jaw-positioning appliance , mono-block , Herbst appliance effective OSA child , remain unclear choose functional appliance , treatment difference removable functional appliance fix functional appliance improve airway dimension .</detailed_description>
