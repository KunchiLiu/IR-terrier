	<detailed_description>Gay , bisexual , men sex men ( MSM ) population severely affect HIV U.S. one risk group U.S. new infection continue rise . MSM also experience vastly disproportionate risk mental health disorder , especially depression anxiety . Numerous study show mental health disparity arise early ongoing stressor , know minority stress , MSM experience relate sexual orientation . Despite fact minority stress strongly relate anxiety depression , minority stress relate mental health problem synergistically propel HIV risk behavior , exist HIV prevention intervention target minority stress order reduce MSM 's HIV risk behavior . This project aim develop theoretically-driven intervention reduces health-depleting effect minority stress target basic psychosocial mechanism link minority stress HIV risk behavior . These mechanism include maladaptive emotion regulation , negative thinking style , low self-efficacy , avoidance , impulsivity , target exist cognitive-behavioral , manualized intervention -- Unified Protocol Transdiagnostic Treatment Emotional Disorders ( UPTTED ) . The UPTTED change mechanisms use motivational interviewing , interoceptive situational exposure , cognitive restructuring , mindfulness , self-monitoring exercise , ground cognitive-behavioral principle developmental affective neuroscience model stress . The propose study adapt UPTTED support high-risk MSM 's adaptive coping minority stress , alleviate associate depression anxiety , reduce HIV risk behavior . The adapted UPTTED expect increase awareness unhealthy impact minority stress ; facilitate objective self-schemas face minority stress ; strengthen one 's skill self-efficacy manage minority stress associate anxiety depression reduce risk acquire HIV . MSM experience minority stress , mental health problem , HIV risk behavior previous 3 month ( n = 30 ) community health expert ( n = 30 ) provide suggestion adaptation exist intervention manual , include culturally relevant vignette , example , exercise adaptively respond minority stress manage HIV risk . The feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy adapt intervention test randomized waitlist control trial MSM ( n = 60 ) report recent experience minority stress , depression anxiety , HIV risk behavior . The primary outcome HIV risk behavior . Secondary outcome reduction mediator include depression , anxiety , mechanisms conceptual model . This project innovatively seek test preliminary efficacy first theoretically-driven intervention target mental sexual health consequence minority stress target underlying mechanism powerfully drive simultaneous health threat .</detailed_description>
