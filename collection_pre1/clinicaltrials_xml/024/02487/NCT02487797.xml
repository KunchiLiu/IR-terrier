	<detailed_description>This randomize double blind clinical trial consent nulliparous woman spontaneous labor require oxytocin labor augmentation seek determine whether use high dose oxytocin regimen improves obstetric outcome compare low dose oxytocin regimen , manner safe mother neonate . This project include 1002 woman recruit obstetrical service Prentice Women 's Hospital . Women include least 36 week gestation , singleton pregnancy , diagnose spontaneous labor spontaneous rupture membrane . Women expose oxytocin indication labor augmentation discretion obstetric provider . Women randomize equal probability intervention group use fix allocation procedure . To maintain double blind design , Prentice Women 's Hospital pharmacy carry randomization oxytocin solution accord random assignment neither woman care provider investigator know identity intervention assignment . The low-dose oxytocin regimen group receive start oxytocin regimen concentration rate 2 milliunits/minute increase increment 2 milliunits/minute , per discretion obstetric provider . The high-dose oxytocin regimen group receive start oxytocin regimen concentration rate 6 milliunits/minute increase increment 6 milliunits/minute , per discretion obstetric provider . Once woman enrol , randomize , receipt assign intervention , clinical management leave discretion woman 's obstetric provider . Prior discharge hospital , baseline demographic clinical data obtain via chart review .</detailed_description>
