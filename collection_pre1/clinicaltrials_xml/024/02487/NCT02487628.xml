	<brief_title>Evaluation HQ® Matrix Soft Tissue Mesh Treatment Inguinal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HQ® Matrix Soft Tissue Mesh warp-knitted , multifilament , bioengineered scaffold comprise silk fibroin protein Bombyx mori ( B. mori ) silkworm . The porous network structure make soft pliable convenient implant . The mesh mechanically strong , biocompatible , long-term bioresorbable . The pore size suitable macrophage migration recruitment , hinders bacteria growth . The mesh provide single sheet vary widths length may cut shape size desire specific application . It sterile single-patient use . ULTRAPRO® Partially Absorbable Lightweight Mesh ( Ethicon , Inc. ) manufacture approximately equal part absorbable poliglecaprone-25 monofilament fiber non-absorbable polypropylene monofilament fiber . Designed open laparoscopic hernia repair , allow surgeon versatility perform various hernia repair single technology . It offer excellent strength minimal foreign body mass , allow patient heal naturally increase comfort mobility .</detailed_description>
