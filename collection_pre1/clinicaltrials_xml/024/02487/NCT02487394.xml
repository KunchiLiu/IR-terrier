	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand function asthma COPD , response therapy . There two Phases study broken two arm . In Phase I , propose use discovery protein technique identify protein expression signature . In Phase II , establish validate predictive value protein signatures treatment response use inhaled corticosteroid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protein Biomarker Discovery Validation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) And Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two Phases study broken two arm . In Phase I , propose use discovery proteomics high throughput technique identify protein expression signature . The total planned size Phase I 100 patient . Patients divide two identical arm base smoking status . One arm contain subject active smoker arm contain subject active smoking . Active smoking define daily use cigarette , pipe , cigarillo cigar time entry study duration study . No active smoking define never smoke stop smoke 5 year great . Each arm contain 50 subject , 26 COPD ( Stage II III 13 subject ) along 24 asthmatic ( Mild Moderate disease 12 subject ) . The investigator recruit Stage IV COPD due heighten risk bronchoscopy patient . In second Phase , establish validate predictive value proteomic signature therapeutic response use inhaled corticosteroid . For Phase II , investigator recruit total 80 subject include subject continue study Phase I . Patients continue Phase I wait 4-6 week bronchoscopy start Phase II . This do order avoid prior bronchoscopy affect Phase II result . Phase II divide two arm base active smoking status discuss previously . Each arm contain 40 subject , 20 COPD ( Stage II III 10 subject ) along 20 asthmatic ( Mild Moderate disease 10 subject ) .</detailed_description>
