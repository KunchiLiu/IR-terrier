	<brief_summary>Background : Chemotherapy damage cancer cell DNA cell die tumor shrink . But may stop work people time . This partly due efficient DNA damage repair mechanism use tumor cell . VX-970 may stop cancer cell prevent repair DNA damage chemotherapy . The purpose study see use chemotherapy drug topotecan along drug VX-970 improve response chemotherapy . Objective : To study safety efficacy VX-970 topotecan treat small cell lung cancer . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old small cell lung cancer . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood heart test , scan . Most test part routine care . Most test repeat throughout study . The study set 21-day cycle . Participants get topotecan IV day 1 5 . They get VX-970 IV day 5 alone day 5 day 2 . Participants doctor monitor weekly first cycle , every 3 week . For Part 1 Study dos topotecan VX-970 increase ( accord Protocol ) determine maximum safe dose combination . The maximum safe dose combination dose 1 6 people intolerable side effect . More participant join Phase 2 . They take drug maximum safe dose , schedule drug take Phase 1 . Participants give sample blood , hair , tumor tissue ( optional ) different time . They discuss side effect every visit . A month stop take drug , participant physical exam blood drawn . They follow-up phone call every 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Topotecan With VX-970 , ATR Kinase Inhibitor , Small Cell Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) aggressive cancer poor prognosis . Although highly responsive chemotherapy initially , SCLC typically relapse quickly become refractory treatment within month . There one FDA approve treatment patient relapse SCLC first-line chemotherapy : topotecan , inhibits religation topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA break lead lethal doublestrand DNA break . The survival SCLC cell despite initial tumor sensitivity chemotherapy suggest existence highly effective DNA damage response network . SCLC characterize high replication stress ( RB1 inactivation , MYC CCNE1 activation ) defective ATM-p53 signal pathway , cause excessive reliance ATR survival follow DNA damage . We hypothesize combination ATR kinase inhibition DNA damaging agent topotecan provide attractive synthetically lethal therapeutic option SCLC . VX-970 potent selective kinase inhibitor ATR , vitro data support hypothesis ATR inhibition improve SCLC response DNA damage agent . Primary objective : Phase 1 : To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) topotecan combination VX-970 . Phase 2 : To assess efficacy respect clinical response rate combination topotecan VX-970 second-line treatment patient SCLC . Eligibility : Both Phase 1 2 : Subjects must great equal 18 year age performance status ( ECOG ) less equal 2 . Subjects must receive chemotherapy , undergone major surgery within 4 week radiotherapy within 24 hour prior enrollment . Phase 1 : Subjects histologically confirm SCLC , NSCLC , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , neuroendocrine cancer , least one prior chemotherapy . Patients histolgies allow standard treatment option exist . Patients evaluable , measurable disease eligible Phase I . Phase 2 : Subjects histological confirmation SCLC one prior platinum-based chemotherapy . Patients platinum-sensitive platinum-refractory disease eligible . Patients must measurable disease eligible Phase II . Design : Participants meet inclusion exclusion criterion receive topotecan VX-970 administer every 21 day ( 1 cycle ) , disease progression development intolerable side effect . Blood hair sample collect multiple time point cycle 1 ( pre-treatment day 1 , post treatment day 2 , 3 ) PD analysis . Tumor biopsy , optional , obtained baseline , first treatment cycle ( approximately 15 hour first dose VX-970 day 3 ) disease progression except subject first dose level . Participants first dose level undergo biopsy day 3 prior third dose topotecan . Participants monitor weekly first cycle clinic visit basic lab . Toxicity grade accord CTCAE version 4.0 , tumor assessment make use CT scan ( chest , abdomen pelvis ) baseline every 2 cycle accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline version 1.1 . Follow-up survival carry every 3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Both Phase I Phase II : Male female subject great equal 18 year age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use topotecan combination VX970 subject less 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatrics trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky less 60 % ) Subjects must measurable disease enrollment Phase II , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) less 20 mm conventional technique great equal to10 mm spiral CT scan . Subjects evaluable , measurable disease eligible Phase 1 . Subjects must receive chemotherapy , undergone major surgery within 4 week radiotherapy within 24 hour prior enrollment . Adequate organ function Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.5x10^9/L Platelets great equal 100x10^9/L Total Bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dL Transaminases alkaline phosphatase less equal 2 x ULN liver metastasis present , less equal 3xULN Creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance CockroftGault formula great equal 60 mL/min Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . The effect VX970 develop human fetus unknown For reason topotecan know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , study participation 6 month last dose study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Phase I : Subjects histologically confirm SCLC , NSCLC , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer , neuroendocrine cancer eligible . Pathological confirmation diagnosis do NCI Laboratory Pathology . Patients histology allow standard treatment option exist . At least one prior chemotherapy NSCLC subject EGFR mutation ALK translocation previously receive appropriate FDA approve therapy addition prior chemotherapy Phase II : Histological confirmation SCLC , extrapulmonary small cell cancer , perform NCI Laboratory Pathology Subjects platinumsensitive platinumrefractory disease eligible EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects tumor amenable potentially curative therapy . Prior treatment topotecan irinotecan exclusion phase II . For phase I , subject receive prior topotecan irinotecan eligible . Subjects receive investigational agent .
