	<brief_summary>Patients least two risk factor incisional hernia undergo abdominal surgery eligible inclusion . After accept informed consent , patient randomize either close abdominal wall regular way fascial suture , close fascial suture together place TIGR mesh described . All patient monitor sign infection , wound rupture , incisional hernia , subcutaneous seroma well postoperative symptom . All patient follow least 5 year . One year postoperatively , computer scan perform detect asymptomatic incisional hernia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Routine Abdominal Wall Closure Versus Reinforcement With TIGR Matrix Onlay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose aim Wound dehiscence ( WD ) , i.e . rupture wound along suture , incisional hernia ( IH ) , i.e . protrusion peritoneum content incompletely heal abdominal wall , common potentially serious complication abdominal surgery . Various medical report indicate 10-35 % laparotomy patient suffer wound complication , lead extend hospital stay severe patient morbidity . One approach mitigate problem use prophylactic surgical mesh surgery order reinforce suture line . Conventional surgical mesh commonly compose polypropylene successfully demonstrate reduce incidence IH approximately 70 % . However , synthetic polypropylene mesh permanent implant , may cause chronic inflammation , seroma , pain infection . Furthermore , additional surgery necessary , implanted polypropylene mesh complicate procedure . A solution problem suture reinforcement use resorbable ( biologically degradable ) non-permanent mesh provide structural support heal phase , gradually absorb . The TIGR Matrix Surgical Mesh completely synthetic resorbable mesh desire property use non-permanent wound reinforcement . The patented TIGR mesh weave two different type fiber , one fast one slowly resorb able . This allow resorbtion take place two distinct stage . The fast fiber copolymer glycotide , lactide trimethylene carbonate , slow fiber copolymer lactide trimethylene carbonate . The two-stage resorbtion matrix provide initial high strength wind support , gradual loss mechanical strength fiber degrade . The fast fiber lose mechanical strength two week , full resorbtion approximately four month ; slow fiber lose mechanical strength 9 month , full resorbtion follow 3 year . The TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh evaluate animal model include clinical study abdominal wall repair breast surgery . A pilot study use TIGR® mesh successfully demonstrate safety prevention IH . In order extend clinical use TIGR mesh prophylactic management WD IH , intend carry multicenter randomized clinical study evaluate safety effectiveness TIGR® mesh patient increase risk develop post-surgical wound complication . The intended study impact widespread prophylactic use TIGR mesh surgery worldwide , result significantly decrease hospital cost improve quality life patient . Table 1 . Risk factor incisional hernia - Reoperation - Age 80 year - Generalised malignant decease ( presence distant metastasis time surgery ) - COPD ( Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Grade III-IV accord GOLD classification ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % expect ) - Serum Albumin level &lt; 20 g/l - Sepsis . Infection combination two following : abnormal body temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate blood gas , white blood cell count . - BMI 35-45 ( patient BMI &gt; 45 , additional risk factor require inclusion ) - Hemoglobin &lt; 80 g/l - Diabetes secondary complication ( angiopathia , nephropathia neuropathia ) insulin treatment - Steroid treatment ( least 1 mg betamethasone daily equivalent ) 7 day preoperatively - Smoking ( least 10 cigarette day one year ) - Chemotherapy ( last administration within 2 week prior surgery - Radiation therapy abdominal wall Project description Population Patients least two risk factor ( Table 1 ) incisional hernia undergo laparotomy Intervention Reinforcement suture line TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh order prevent incisional hernia wound dehiscence Control Abdominal closure PDS 2/0 , wound suture ratio 1:4 , without mesh reinforcement . Outcome Primary outcome : postoperative incisional hernia , diagnose clinical control 1,2 5 year postoperatively computer tomography 1 year postoperatively . Design ( accord CONSORT checklist ) 3a Trial design Double-blind randomise control trial 4b Study setting Ten surgical unit participate study . 5 Interventions Patients randomized suture line reinforcement undergo abdominal surgery plan . After close aponeurosis PDS 2/0 , 7 cm wide TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh apply aponeurosis patient randomised suture line reinforcement . The mesh suture aponeurosis continuous PDS 2/0 , wound suture ratio 1:4 . 6a Outcomes Primary outcome • Incisional hernia Secondary outcome : - Time discharge - Postoperative wound dehiscence - Postoperative seroma - Postoperative infection - Incisional hernia ( include date confirm ) - Health-related quality life assess Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire ( VHPQ ) 7a Sample size Patients least two risk factor expect risk least 7.5 % develop incisional hernia one year prophylactic mesh used.7 If prophylactic mesh reduces risk 1.5 % one year surgery,1 187 patient group complete data require achieve chance 80 % detect difference p &lt; 0.05 level . In order compensate drop-outs death end follow-up , total 200 patient would require group . 8a Randomisation : sequence generation The random allocation sequence generate computer . No block do . 9 Randomisation : allocation concealment mechanism The surgeon responsible procedure inform allocation , personnel responsible postoperative care patient . The intervention , i.e . application mesh , perform procedure document separately . 10 Randomisation : implementation The patient perform study prior procedure surgeon responsible procedure . 11a Blinding The patient , crew responsible postoperative care surgeon follow-up blind allocation . 12a Statistical method The risk postoperative wound dehiscence within thirty day surgery analyse chi-two test . The risk incisional hernia test Kaplan-Meier statistic . 12b Additional analysis Subgroup analyse perform patient undergo abdominal surgery approach midline incision base risk factor list Table 1 . Significance If study show significant reduction incidence WD IH without substantial increase risk would complication , may great impact wound closure practice . Applying onlay mesh require little effort term technical skill time mesh produce low cost market become large enough . If risk develop IH WD reduce resorbable mesh extent permanent mesh,1 health care cost may reduce substantially8 health-related quality life improve large group .</detailed_description>
