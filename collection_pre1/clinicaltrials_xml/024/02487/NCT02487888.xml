	<brief_title>A Study Impact Genetic Testing Clinical Decision Making Patient Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The molecular basis many pharmacogenetic polymorphism elucidate , genetic variation result alteration expression function receptor , enzyme , transporter relevant safety efficacy medical treatment . Genetics show significant factor variability responses medication choice dose . With rapid development cost-effective high throughput molecular genotyping method , pharmacogenetics become increasingly important potential identify patient increase risk adverse drug reaction decrease likelihood response standard dosage drug . By identify genetic risk effective therapy individual patient , clinician may improve efficacy treatment decrease risk adverse drug event . The addition pharmacogenetic test routine clinical practice may also extremely helpful cost reduction associate identification patient respond expensive drug identification patient likely suffer severe adverse event . There also tremendous effort pharmaceutical industry low cost drug development ; pharmacogenetics may fulfill need provide right drug right patient increase likelihood success large phase II phase III clinical trial . The purpose study evaluate currently available genetic test implement various clinic around United States , whether information result benefit patient care . Patients present clinic pain , cardiovascular condition , Arthritis , Type II Diabetes , and/or Mental Health disorder receive Proove Bioscience 's genetic test complete validate questionnaire measure specific outcomes related treatment clinical visit , include medication efficacy , reduction adverse drug event , healthcare utilization . Physicians document change make treatment regimen , include adjustment medication non-pharmacological treatment , improvement outcome measure . Statistical analysis perform calculate relationship genotypic phenotypic data point collect study . The result study provide measurable understand medical economic value implement genetic test clinical care . Furthermore , data point collect used examine novel correlation association single nucleotide polymorphisms longitudinal clinical outcome measure .</detailed_description>
