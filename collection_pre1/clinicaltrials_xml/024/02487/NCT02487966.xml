	<brief_title>Optimizing Rehabilitation Phantom Limb Pain Using Mirror Therapy Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) belong group neuropathic pain syndrome characterize pain amputated limb . Rehabilitation chronic pain involve structure treatment plan target dimension pain experience , include comprehensive interdisciplinary approach allow patient receive benefit accord need . As chronic pain syndrome , chronic Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) often difficult treat ; show resistant classical pharmacological surgical treatment approach . In context , hypothesize novel treatment PLP need target specific neural network associate maladaptive plasticity . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS , Soterix © ) powerful non-invasive technique brain stimulation know significantly modulate plasticity alleviate chronic pain various syndrome . device trial . This study usiGiven tDCS underlie neural mechanism , critical use multimodal approach treatment - use tDCS behavioral therapy simultaneously . In case , ideal therapy mirror therapy ( MT ) . Recently , show anodal tDCS induce selective short-lasting relief PLP , repeat application anodal tDCS induces long-lasting analgesic effect . These preliminary result show tDCS may promise rehabilitative tool management chronic PLP . This neurorehabilitation technique commonly use PLP , design modulate cortical mechanism pain perform movement use unaffected limb front mirror . We propose carry mechanistic , factorial , randomize control trial evaluate novel rehabilitation approach combine tDCS MT PLP patient . We aim compare brain change treatment order study mechanisms underlying PLP .</detailed_description>
