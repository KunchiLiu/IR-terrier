	<brief_summary>Isolated thrombocytopenia common severe complication HSCT , often lead increase risk life-threatening hemorrhage , frequent requirement platelet transfusion extend hospital stay , represent challenge clinical problem . Current treatment thrombocytopenia HSCT frequently unsatisfactory platelet recovery prevent potentially fatal bleeding complication . Therefore , urgent explore effective therapy improve outcome thrombocytopenia HSCT . Previous study demonstrate decitabine , hypomethylating agent , may reduce platelet transfusion myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) patient . The investigator conduct prospective clinical trial evaluate safety efficiency rhTPO decitabine treatment thrombocytopenia follow HSCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Patients With Thrombocytopenia Following HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Isolated thrombocytopenia frequent severe complication hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . It often lead increase risk life-threatening hemorrhage , frequent requirement platelet transfusion extend hospital stay , represent challenge clinical problem . Current treatment thrombocytopenia HSCT , include thrombopoietin , interleukin-11 , immunoglobulin , methylprednisolone rituximab , frequently unsatisfactory platelet recovery . Therefore , urgent explore effective therapy improve outcome thrombocytopenia HSCT . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) cytokine drive thrombopoiesis stimulate differentiation stem cell megakaryocytes promote megakaryocyte proliferation polyploidization . Decitabine approve treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) DNA methylation inhibitor . Studies vitro show decitabine enhances platelet release megakaryocyte maturation . Here , investigator perform prospective clinical trial , order investigate safety efficiency rhTPO decitabine treatment thrombocytopenia follow HSCT .</detailed_description>
