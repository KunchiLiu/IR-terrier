	<brief_summary>We conduct Phase II study investigate PEGPH20 combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel patient borderline resectable PDAC Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center UCSF . There multiple definition borderline resectable PDAC include MD Anderson definition criterion develop Consensus Conference sponsor American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association , Society Surgical Oncology , Society Surgery Alimentary Tract . Borderline resectable PDAC case identify per definition develop currently run inter-group pilot trial borderline resectable pancreatic cancer ( NCT01821612 ) . Per trial , borderline resectable PDAC define `` presence one follow CT : - An interface primary tumor superior mesenteric vein portal vein ( SMV-PV ) measure ≥ 180° circumference vessel wall - Short-segment occlusion SMV-PV normal vein level obstruction amenable resection venous reconstruction - Short segment interface ( degree ) tumor hepatic artery normal artery proximal distal interface amenable resection reconstruction . - An interface tumor , SMA measure &lt; 180º circumference vessel wall . This trial conduct two part . In Part I , pre-treatment EUS-guided core biopsy pancreatic tumor , CA 19-9 level functional MRIs include DCE-MRI DWI-MRI obtain first fifteen patient enrol . After 1-week run-in period PEGPH20 day 1 4 , patient repeat EUS-guided core biopsy , functional MRI , CA 19-9 level baseline CT chest , abdomen pelvis . Subsequently , patient start treatment PEGPH20 , gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel give weekly 3 week , every 28 day . To evaluate disease response treatment , CA 19-9 level check monthly restaging CT chest , abdomen pelvis obtain every 8 week . If disease progression point study , patient take study alternative treatment offer . At completion 4 cycle therapy , restaging CT scan obtain determine resectability . If patient find resectable disease , additional functional MRI obtain evaluate PDAC stroma . If patient able successful surgery , tissue analysis perform resect pancreatic tumor . These patient proceed get 2 cycle adjuvant chemotherapy gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel . If patient deem surgical candidate find unresectable disease operating room , intraoperative core biopsy pancreatic tumor obtain tissue analysis . At time initiation therapy PEGPH20 , patient start prophylactic dose enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneous daily . This continue throughout study participation . In Part II , additional 21 patient enrol , begin neoadjuvant therapy PEGPH20 , gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel without 1 week run-in PEGPH20-only pre- post-run-in EUS-guided biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For Specific Aim 1 , monitor post-operative complication clinically relevant pancreatic fistula within one week surgery per standard clinical guideline note . Common clinical presentation pancreatic fistula include abdominal pain , leukocytosis fever ( temperature &gt; 100.4 degree ) . Diagnostic work-up pancreatic fistula CT abdomen contrast , sensitivity 63 % specificity 83 % detect pancreatic fistula . The pancreatic fistula categorize grade A , B C previously report . Our study investigate clinically relevant pancreatic fistula , i.e . grade B C. Depending grade pancreatic fistula , patient treat indicated conservative treatment option include bowel rest , antibiotic , somatostatin analogue percutaneous drainage surgical re-exploration . We also track relevant post-operative complication delay wound healing , development wound dehiscence wound infection . The tissue analyse include review immunohistochemical ( IHC ) stain actin , hyaluronic acid stain bind protein probe , proliferation measure ki-67 % Phospho-histone H3 ( Ph-H3 ) ; cell apoptosis evaluate IHC stain cleave caspase 3 ( CC3 ) Tunel . If limited tissue sample obtain via core biopsy , priority tissue analysis follow : ( 1 ) fix formalin H &amp; E IHC ( Ph-H3 ; CC3/Tunel ; HA binding ) ; ( 2 ) fix OCT IHC difficult antibody do ( potentially obtain mRNA DNA ) . The IHC study do UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center Immunohistochemistry Molecular Pathology Core . The tissue analyse biopsy surgical specimen do study pathologist . The CT MR image analysis perform Abdominal Imaging UCSF . To decrease impact metal stent may functional MRI result , include patient plastic stent study . In addition , reduce variability result , DCE-MRI DWI-MRI obtain MR machine similar time day baseline scan . The DCE-MRI image analyze calculate Ktrans DWI-MRI image analyze calculate ADC describe elsewhere . We scan patient torso coil 3T clinical MR scanner . Imaging include MR diffusion b-values 0 , 125 , 500 estimate perfusion tumor , dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging ( DCE-MRI ) measurement Ktrans , blood volume , blood flow . The region tumor determine MR image reference baseline CT scan . The native T1 pancreas liver calculate series four , 3D , spoil gradient recall echo ( SPGR ) sequence different flip angle . The conventional DCE-MRI acquire 3D , fast spoiled gradient echo sequence , cover target area pancreas liver , temporal resolution 5 sec 6 minute administration 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine . DCE-MRI image post-processed use MIStar software ( Apollo Medical Imaging , Melbourne , Australia ) , allow motion correction account shift data . Datasets artifacts eliminate post processing . After contrast delivery , new T1 calculate presumed change Gd concentration [ Gd ] = ( 1/T1-1/T10 ) /R1 R1 assume 4.5 sec-1 mmol/L-1 3T . Run-in Period PEGPH20 - Days 1 , 4 PEGPH20 3 ug/kg Dexamethasone 8mg PO 1-2 hour pre-PEGPH20 PO 8-to-12 hour post-PEGPH20 *Start enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneous daily day 1 ( continue throughout trial ) - On day 8 run-in period PEGPH20 , EUS-directed core biopsy , CA 19-9 , functional MRI CT chest , abdomen ( pancreatic protocol ) pelvis obtain . Cycle 1 onward -Day 1 , 8 , 15 PEGPH20 3 ug/kg + Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 + nab-Paclitaxel 125mg/m2 Dexamethasone 8mg PO 1-2 hour pre-PEGPH20 PO 8-to-12 hour post-PEGPH20 - Gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel administer 2-4 hour post-PEGPH20 . - Neoadjuvant therapy four 28-day cycle CT chest , abdomen pelvis scan CA 19-9 measurement every 8 week . Patients take study evidence disease progression . - After four cycle neoadjuvant therapy , patient evaluate surgical resection depend CT scan finding obtain cycle 4 , day 21 . - If resectable disease , functional MRI follow restaging CT scan . If patient successful resection , receive 2 additional cycle gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel . If find unresectable disease operating room , intra-operative core biopsy obtain . - If unresectable disease restaging scan follow 4 cycle therapy , take study .</detailed_description>
