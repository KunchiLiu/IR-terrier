	<brief_title>Effectiveness Differing Levels Support Family Mealtimes Obesity Prevention Among Head Start Preschools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Despite slight decrease obesity prevalence low-income child , nearly 25 % child age 5 year overweight obese . Socioeconomic disparity early childhood place low-income child 1.5 2 time high risk obesity compare middle- upper-income child make obesity prevention target low-income child top public health priority . Recently , obesity intervention turn toward promotion family mealtimes obesity prevention strategy . Even among family economic resource , plan implement family mealtime challenge . Barriers family mealtime among low-income family , however , intensify . Further , low-income parent face chronic stressor poverty likely experience compromise executive functioning skill , impede ability plan organize event mealtime . They also likely encounter decision fatigue , deteriorate quality decision make multiple decision making demands1 ( e.g. , continual daily decision maximize limited financial , social , emotional resource ) . In context poverty , parent 's meal planning capacity diminish mealtime decision may make impulsively . Most family mealtime intervention approach target meal planning skill knowledge parental modeling healthy eating , without significant regard practical resource would enable meal plan implementation . There strike lack evidence level resource low-income parent need implement family mealtime . The investigator ' approach build premise : 1 ) enhance ability parent implement healthy family mealtimes critical effective obesity prevention ; 2 ) parent implement regular healthy family mealtime , solely due lack nutrition education knowledge , combine adverse effect poverty capability parent plan execute healthy family mealtime . Identifying resource need aid low-income family plan implement family meal crucial unknown information . Without information , effective intervention plan . In integrated Coordinated Agricultural Project ( CAP ) application , investigator propose test main , additive interactive effect 6 intervention component reflect differing level practical resource increase frequency healthy family mealtime , improve child 's dietary quality ultimately reduce childhood obesity prevalence . Using innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ; cutting-edge approach maximize resource behavioral intervention identify efficient intervention model possible ) , investigator test 6 intervention component Screening Phase ( N = 520 ) , result implementation evaluation `` final '' intervention model Confirming Phase ( N = 250 ) bundle component yield robust effect . The 6 intervention component include : ( 1 ) Meal Delivery : home delivery pre-made healthy family meal include recipe weekly 8 week ; ( 2 ) Ingredient Delivery : home delivery ingredient recipe make healthy family meal weekly 8 week ; ( 3 ) Community Kitchen : community kitchen session family prepare healthy meal recipe take home weekly 8 week ; ( 4 ) Didactics : nutrition education class use Preschool Obesity Prevention Series ( POPS ) curriculum , develop evaluate team 400 low-income Head Start parent 2 weekly 8 week ( 5 ) Cooking Lessons : cooking lessons/demonstrations recipes weekly 8 week ; ( 6 ) Cookware/Flatware : delivery flatware/ cookware utilize family meal deliver begin 8 week intervention . MOST comprehensive , principled , engineering-inspired framework optimize evaluate multicomponent behavioral intervention . MOST include randomize , control trial ( RCT ) intervention evaluation , unlike standard approach intervention development , also include key step RCT . These step aim intervention optimization identify intervention component yield robust effect . MOST designed practical , hold possibility achieve rapid long-run improvement intervention without dramatic increase intervention research resource . By test 6 different intervention component simultaneously use factorial design form basis MOST , able identify cost-effective strategy achieve childhood obesity prevention Extension framework . Given substantial amount resource dedicate obesity prevention Extension , result inform appropriate resource allocation . Study Design The first phase MOST , investigator undertake Years 1 2 proposal , refer `` Screening Phase '' , refers systematic test intervention component ultimately build effective intervention . Using factorial design , objective implement MOST Screening Phase answer question : Which set program component active contribute positive outcome , include intervention ? Which program component inactive counterproductive , discard ? In Screening Phase , 520 participant enrol four cohort . After indentification key component package intervention , critical intervention bundle latter year study evaluate standard 2-arm RCT , refer MOST terminology `` Confirming Phase '' . The Confirming Phase answer question : Is intervention , package , efficacious intervention effect large enough justify investment community implementation ? In Confirming Phase , final model intervention deliver school year October April , begin Fall 2017 Fall 2018 randomize control trial ( N = 250 , half randomly assign bundle intervention half receive usual Head Start exposure ) . In Confirming Phase , investigator hypothesize finalize intervention lead child 's improve dietary quality , importantly , improved adiposity index . Participants recruit partner Head Start program serf mixed rural urban area . Children family represent diverse group ( race 67 % white , 28 % black ; ethnicity 23 % Hispanic ; 12.6 % English second language ) per year . Data collect home prior conclusion intervention . Head Start teacher also complete behavioral rating child . Statistical Analysis- Screening Phase In Screening Phase , primary aim test intent-to-treat basis use ANOVA model test whether factor ( intervention ) significant effect frequency healthy , family mealtime dietary quality 8 week-period pre- post-intervention . The investigator also include two- three-way interaction component identify effect interaction intervention component outcomes . The secondary primary aim make decision intervention component component level base factorial experiment result . The investigator use modify version decision make approach frequently use engineering , emphasize main effect , use interaction additional valuable information . Statistical Analysis- Confirming Phase The primary objective determine whether bundle intervention vs. intervention comparison group effective reduce child 's adiposity index . Baseline comparability 2 group assess use t-test continuous variable Ï‡2 test categorical variable . To account cluster child within Head Start classroom , Proc Mixed SAS random intercept classroom use . The investigator employ logistic regression model use General Estimating Equations ( GEE ) techniques account classroom clustering compare change prevalence obesity overweight across 2 group . Analyses conduct without adjustment baseline characteristic age , sex , race , baseline BMI BMI z-score . Evaluation Educational Objectives , Process Fidelity Evaluation Maternal mealtime self-efficacy , mealtime barrier , knowledge obesity prevention behavior , resource , perception mealtime climate compare pre-post intervention group use ANOVA model determine change compare group . The investigator analyze data recruitment , retention , participant educator satisfaction , also implementation fidelity data , use basic descriptive statistic . The investigator use qualitative approach analyze interview data obtain HS staff , Extension participate parent ( i.e. , identify theme ; segment response meaningful category ) . The process evaluation data inform continue collaboration HS Extension , allow investigator effectively disseminate finding . Likewise , result descriptive analysis fidelity self-report ( Extension ) observational data analyze .</detailed_description>
