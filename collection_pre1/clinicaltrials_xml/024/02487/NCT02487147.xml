	<brief_summary>This study compare efficacy Free Air Portable Air Powered Respirator ( PAPR ) system versus N95 mask prevent nasal detection influenza follow exposure . The investigator hypothesize use Free Air PAPR system superior N95 respirator interrupt exposure study participant aerosolize influenza virus particle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Airborne transmission represent one rapidly spread least understood dissemination mechanism pathogen . Public health strategy prevent control often explosive outbreak associate pathogen : 1 ) vaccination treatment , available , 2 ) decontamination expose area surface , 3 ) isolation barrier precaution face mask . Unfortunately , evidence efficacy currently recommend barrier precaution currently lack . Attempts validate effectiveness personal protective equipment limit vitro experiment mannequin head . This human exposure study provide much accurate life-like exposure scenario . The use live attenuate influenza virus vaccine prove safe . Objectives : Evaluate Free Air Portable Air Powered Respirator ( PAPR ) versus N95 face mask prevent airborne cross-transmission aerosolize influenza human participant . Methods : Participants randomize one two arm : ) N95 respirator , b ) Free Air PAPR System . The primary outcome rate transmission 2 study group , nasal nasopharyngeal swab perform immediately follow exposure .</detailed_description>
