	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer third cause death male . Majority patient local disease cure local treatment . Metastases rare time diagnosis may occur failure local treatment ( SEER ) . Recommended treatment non castrate metastatic prostate cancer ( NCMPC ) castration orchiectomy medical castration LH-RH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) agonists alone combine androgen blockage LH-RH agonist anti androgen . Immediate treatment versus defer treatment improve specific survival advance prostatic cancer : initial result Medical Research Council trial . Continuous castration superior intermittent one median survival 49 month . Chemotherapy combine castration demonstrate survival improvement compare castration alone high volume disease define visceral involvement 4 bone metastatis almost one apendicular metastasis . For low volume disease non select metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer , Docetaxel demonstrate survival benefit evaluate recent phase III trial ( Sweeney C et al ab ASCO 2014 ) . However , patient show initial response hormonal therapy advance prostate cancer progress castration-resistant phase disease much poor prognosis . Median duration androgen deprivation 24 36 month , patient become castrate resistant docetaxel hormonal therapy like abiraterone enzalutamide demonstrate survival improvement castrate resistant prostate cancer . Despite considerable progress make new agent abiraterone acetate MDV3100 metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , new therapy critical improve castration sensitivity . Understanding mechanisms resistance AR identify direct new therapy real challenge situation . Prostate cancer characterize dependence AR frequent activation Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway . Besides resistance mediate mutation AR , among non-steroid alternative pathway two major pathway associate AR activation CRPC , namely Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK PI3K/AKT . More specifically genomic profile human prostate cancer recently report 42 % primary 100 % metastatic lesion study upregulated PI3K signal mostly via loss phosphatase activity PTEN ( Phosphatase tensin homolog ) INPP4B ( inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II ) . Dysregulation PI3K/PTEN pathway also associate resistance conventional antiandrogen therapy . Preclinical data support potential reciprocal negative feedback AR PI3K pathway . Development castration resistance multifactorel include weak antagonist bind affi nity AR , up-regulation AR co-stimulatory pathway increase intratumoural androgen level result intracrine androgen , well partial agonist property antiandrogens AR overexpressed .</detailed_description>
