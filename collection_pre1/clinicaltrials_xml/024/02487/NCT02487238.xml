	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : 500,000 child adult across North America affect ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , inflammatory bowel disease characterize immune dysregulation . Ontario , Canada high rate childhood-onset UC world andthis disease particularly debilitate childhood . Effects growth development profound pediatric onset disease , exist treatment , include long-term immunosuppression , carry short long-term risk infection , malignancy , toxicity . The intestinal bacteria critical role regulation immune system . Fecal microbial transplantation ( FMT ) , transfer intestinal bacteria healthy donor recipient , show treat recurrent Clostridium difficile intestinal infection . The therapeutic potential FMT UC demonstrate recent adult UC trial institution ( primary investigator : Dr. Paul Moayyedi ; collaborator PediFETCh trial ) . Randomized , placebo-controlled trial FMT pediatric inflammatory bowel disease nonexistent . FMT may present valuable , safer therapeutic option pediatric UC randomized-controlled trial need . OBJECTIVES : Our objective determine whether FMT improve clinical , biological , mucosal disease status pediatric UC IBD-U . Before proceed multicenter trial , pilot study provide access FMT treatment demonstrate feasibility study design future , multicenter trial . HYPOTHESES : Based previously publish case series pediatrics , recent randomize controlled trial adult , hypothesize participant receive fecal microbial enema contain healthy donor bacteria experience clinical remission , improvement inflammatory marker , long duration remission compare participant receive placebo . STUDY DESIGN : The propose study single-center , randomize , control , single-blind trial . Pediatric patient diagnosis UC , IBD-U enrol randomize receive 6 week bi-weekly fecal microbial enema normal saline enema ( placebo ) . Fecal enema contain healthy donor stool extensively safety-screened provide Rebiotix ( R ) ( RBX-2660 ) . Participants may continue exist UC medical treatment ( probiotic , 5-ASAs , immunomodulators , antiTNF ) , change dose new therapy permit study period . All fecal enema deliver study site investigator ensure consistency technique viability fecal transplant material . Participants clinical disease activity score measure enema administration ( 6 week ) , week 18 30 . Stool sample collect time point throughout trial microbiome analysis , fecal calprotectin measurement , support Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute . Bloodwork collect throughout trial measure change biological disease activity . SAMPLE SIZE : 50 patient recruited trial . Participants single-blinded , randomized placebo treatment arm . SAFETY MONITORING : Study risk include complication fecal microbial transplant ( infection , fever ) . Based result previous study , exist safety data fecal enema preparation ( RBX2660 ) previously conduct trial , risk infection , adverse gastrointestinal symptom , adverse event extremely low . The fecal enema preparation use trial ( RBX2660 ) Rebiotix ( R ) receive FDA IND Health Canada approval clinical trial recurrent C. difficile . Donors initially prescreened , donor blood stool extensively screen two discrete time point prior administration . We provide close follow-up participant throughout trial center , partnership refer physician bi-weekly throughout trial . OUTCOMES : 1 . Primary outcome pilot trial measure feasibility . 2 . Secondary outcome measure clinical response . These include : clinical response ( Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [ PUCAI ] score ) , biological response ( serum bloodwork measure ) , mucosal healing ( fecal calprotectin level ) , change fecal microbiome ( change 16 rRNA , infer metagenome , metabolome ) . We assess index mucosal heal trial .</detailed_description>
