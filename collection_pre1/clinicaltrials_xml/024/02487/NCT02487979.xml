	<brief_title>Glembatumumab Vedotin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate whether CDX-011 ( glembatumumab vedotin ) therapy either increase disease control rate 4 month patient recurrent measurable osteosarcoma compare historical Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) experience produce objective response rate patient without previous eribulin ( eribulin mesylate ) treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility toxicity profile CDX-011 patient recurrent osteosarcoma . II . To describe pharmacokinetics CDX-011 adolescent young adult recurrent osteosarcoma enrol COG site COG phase I consortium site . III . To determine relationship tumor GPNMB expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) response CDX-011 therapy . IV . To estimate , cohort patient previously treat eribulin , proportion experience disease progression first 4 month CDX-011 therapy proportion patient experience Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) -defined complete partial response . OUTLINE : Patients receive glembatumumab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
