	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data suggest , sugar-based , also artificially sweeten soft drink may play role development diabetes . Recent study animal human show , artificial sweetener ( AS ) influence metabolic response glucose ingestion , possibly alter intestinal microbiome even modulate incretin release . Data human subject sparse controversial , especially long-term manner . We therefore conduct cross-over study ass metabolic response sweeten vs. non-sweetened soft drink , consume period 4 week .</brief_summary>
