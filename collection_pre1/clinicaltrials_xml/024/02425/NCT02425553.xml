	<brief_summary>Reflux dyspeptic symptom common affect 10-20 % population regular basis . Reflux symptoms heartburn regurgitation cause return acid non-acid gastric content esophagus . Dyspeptic symptom cause abnormal gastric relaxation ( impaired accommodation ) increase sensitivity stomach distension meal . The effect diet gastrointestinal function debate efficacy dietary management digestive symptom establish . Epidemiological study suggest effect ; however , possible distinguish effect fat intake total energy ( i.e . calorie ) intake work . This issue address small physiological study . The result show esophageal acid exposure relate total calorie intake fat content . In contrast , number reflux symptom 40 % high high-fat low-fat meal . Similar finding find relationship gastric distension , fullness dyspeptic symptom Magnetic Resonance Imaging . Thus , appear fat cause digestive dysmotility heighten sensitivity visceral event increase number severity symptom report patient . As yet , finding confirm large , representative survey . Similar effect food , inconsistent finding regard effect alcohol gastro-esophageal reflux ( GER ) gastric function . Physiological study note delayed gastric empty increase reflux event alcohol take food . However , large survey confirm alcohol trigger reflux dyspeptic symptom . The propose observational , dietary study cross-over design assess independent effect energy intake ( i.e . calorie load ) fat intake gastric fullness , number severity reflux dyspeptic symptom meal . The effect alcohol symptom high calorie , high fat meal also document . The study population senior academic attend conference likely relatively high prevalence risk factor gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) predominantly male , old age large waist circumference average general community . This increase study power relevance finding . The result provide new information concern impact dietary factor alcohol digestive symptom meal . This data inform future guideline dietary management patient reflux dyspeptic symptom meal relevant primary secondary care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational , dietary study cross-over design . Restaurant style meal beverage provide faculty delegate attend Ascona II conference agree participate provide write consent . Approximately 120 participant expect recruited . On four consecutive day even meal serve vary calorie load fat content use establish , partially balance study design apply previous study . On first three day fruit juice serve , whereas , final day , alcoholic beverage acidity number calorie serve . All meal size salt content . Controlling parameter reduce possible confound factor analysis . 1 . High calorie ( 1200 kcal ) , High fat ( 50 % energy ) , 400 ml juice ( 230 kcal ) 2 . High calorie ( 1200 kcal ) , Low fat ( 20 % energy ) , 400 ml juice ( 230 kcal ) 3 . Low calorie ( 600 kcal ) , Low fat ( 20 % energy ) , 400 ml juice ( 230 kcal ) 4 . High calorie ( 1200 kcal ) , High fat ( 50 % energy ) , 300 ml wine ( 40 g alcohol , 230 kcal ) , 100 ml water Note : The order meal day 1-3 fix , necessarily order . Meal constituent disguise . Note : Testing digestive symptom response diet successive day possible clinical physiological study show evidence sequence effect previous study use similar test meal . An alginate-antacid preparation available require acute relief reflux dyspeptic symptom ( Gaviscon Liquid , Reckitt Benckiser ( available across-the-counter indication Switzerland ) ) . No participant require take preparation . The occurrence severity fullness , reflux dyspeptic symptom record contemporaneously participant three hour four test meal use mobile application ( SymTrack , Gastric Imaging &amp; Analysis GmbH , Zürich , Switzerland ) . Paper form make available without mobile device . Three hour period time reflux dyspeptic symptom often report meal . Positive reporting bias minimize automatic reminder send participant SymTrack every 30 minute three hour remind participant document severity symptom include , appropriate , absence symptom . The use rescue medication treat reflux dyspeptic symptom study also document SymTrack . Symptoms use rescue medication occur three hour period 12 hour ( i.e . follow morning ) document part safety follow-up data ; however contribute primary secondary outcome . All faculty delegate invite participate observational , dietary study . The investigator expect recruit , nearly , attend . The fixed menu provide every night restaurant whether attendee participate study ( unless specific dietary requirement present ) . Involvement almost attendees reduce selection bias ; however , selection bias remain group clinical academic wholly representative general population . Note study population predominantly male , old age large waist circumference average community . These risk factor reflux disease . This increase study power show treatment effect clinical relevance finding . All attend Centro Stefano Franscini conference centre Ascona take even meal together . The cost meal include registration package . This fixed menu non-alcoholic drink ( alcohol available purchase ) . No food available site except individual register special dietary requirement . If food want , available nearby town Ascona . This local organizational arrangement provision fix meal free charge encourage compliance diet . If participant adhere meal beverage set study protocol document use SymTrack . To assess compliance , participant respond question `` patient consume study meal ? `` , `` patient take additional food ? `` , `` patient consume study beverage ? `` , `` patient take additional alcoholic drink ? '' . Failure comply study procedure preclude individual participate following day . The primary study analysis investigate association number symptom caloric fat content meal . It express odds ratio . There qualitative description deviation study protocol . For example participant report drink alcohol meal day 1-3 expressed percentage deviation . The primary secondary variable plus outcomes interest document use mobile application ( SymTrack ; Gastric Imaging Analysis GmbH , Zürich , Switzerland ) . Paper symptom diary available participant without access smartphone . On arrival meeting attendee agree participate sign Written Informed Consent give personal instruction operation mobile application . Should difficulty remain investigator , include involve development app , hand assist participant . Once Written Informed Consent sign participant give unique username password allow log SymTrack start enter screen information symptom . This username allow identification study participant data enter ensure effective monitoring data . The primary analysis perform follow study completion . The primary outcome number reflux dyspeptic symptom . Odds ratio compute describe association number symptom meal calorie load fat content . Secondary outcome severity reflux severity dyspeptic symptom well sensation fullness test meal . Analogue primary outcome odds ratio compute describe association outcomes meal calorie load fat content . An odds ratio compute describe association primary secondary outcome ingestion alcohol meal . An additional analysis perform identify factor - composition test meal - increase likelihood report reflux dyspeptic symptom meal ( e.g . age , gender , BMI low quality life score ) . Control question describe study compliance describe use descriptive statistic . The majority data acquire study originate electronic source . Screening data symptom enter via smartphone immediately transfer encrypted channel server store MySQL-database . Both server application database host professional application host provider locate Switzerland . The server application database design develop test Gastric Imaging &amp; Analysis GmbH . The software version use study test use semi-automated functional test load test . Study principal investigator ( Mark Fox ) responsible data store database . To ensure study conduct accordance ethical principle , internal monitoring carry regularly throughout study . At screen internal monitor review protocol , database aspect study investigator staff . Monitoring carry early study last subject complete study . During monitoring , monitor verify compliance protocol amendment ( ) , review sign informed consent form , diverse log source data . Direct access study-related site source data/documents mandatory monitoring review . Study team staff must make available answer query monitor process .</detailed_description>
