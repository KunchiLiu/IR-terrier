	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well methylprednisolone sodium succinate work treat patient graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) gastrointestinal tract begin within 100 day transplant ( acute GVHD ) . Corticosteroids type drug reduces inflammation . Giving corticosteroid drug , methylprednisolone sodium succinate , directly arteries gastrointestinal tract may help treat inflammation cause GVHD . Giving methylprednisolone sodium succinate addition standard treatment may effective treat GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate Treating Patients With Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Gastrointestinal Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy intra-arterial steroid administration ( IASA ) methylprednisolone sodium succinate ( MePDSL ) dose-schedule treatment de novo acute moderate-to-severe GvHD gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety IASA MePDSL dose-schedule treatment de novo acute moderate-to-severe acute GvHD GIT . II . To assess feasibility IASA MePDSL dose-schedule treatment de novo acute moderate-to-severe acute GvHD GIT . OUTLINE : STUDY AGENT : Patients receive methylprednisolone sodium succinate intra-arterially ( IA ) daily ( QD ) day 1-3 . CONVENTIONAL THERAPY : Patients also receive conventional therapy comprise methylprednisolone sodium succinate intravenously ( IV ) every 12 hour 7-14 day begin day 1 budesonide PO day 1-56 . Patients response day 7-14 may begin taper receive methylprednisolone orally ( PO ) day 28-56 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY ( IST ) : Patients receive conventional IST continue previous prophylactic regimen begin day 1 56 ( beyond ) discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 360 day .</detailed_description>
