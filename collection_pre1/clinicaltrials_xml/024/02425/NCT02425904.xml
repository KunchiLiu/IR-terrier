	<brief_title>Phase II Study Clofarabine Patients With Recurrent Refractory Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational intervention , learn whether drug work treat specific disease , case , clofarabine treat LCH . `` Investigational '' mean intervention still study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve clofarabine disease . Clofarabine chemotherapy drug use approve FDA treatment leukemia child adult . Information research study suggest drug may also effective participant LCH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior diagnosis Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis establish standard diagnostic criterion confirm histologically Evidence disease reactivation progression standard treatment LCH ( histological confirmation require ) Performance Score &gt; 70 % ( use Lansky score age &lt; 16 Karnofsky score age = &gt; 16 ) . Patients age eligible . Provide sign write informed consent . Patients fail first line treatment prednisone vinblastine . There limitation amount type prior therapy drug . Patients clinical evidence involvement hematopoietic system , liver spleen , fail salvage treatment cladribine/cytarabine consider eligible treatment . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior enrollment . Male female patient must use effective contraceptive method study minimum 6 month study treatment . Capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide valid inform consent . Participants must adequate marrow function define , except involvement hematopoietic system criterion waive : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750/µL Platelets ≥75,000/µL Participants must adequate organ function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal unless related involvement LCH Adequate renal function define : A serum creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants may receive investigational agent target LCH . Use alternative medication ( e.g. , herbal botanical could interfere clofarabine ) permit entire study period . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study clofarabine potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant , breastfeed discontinue mother treated clofarabine . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients history prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , elevate conjugate serum bilirubin study entry , uncontrolled systemic fungal , bacterial , infection , history hepatitis B C infection history cirrhosis . Individuals know HIVpositive combination antiretroviral therapy .</criteria>
