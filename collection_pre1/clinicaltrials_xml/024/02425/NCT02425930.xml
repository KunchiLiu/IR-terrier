	<brief_title>The Predictive Value Complement C3 Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The complement system play important role development digestive malignancy . The complement C3 point convergence three complement activation pathway . However , concrete effect C3 development gastric cancer still obscure . This study design explore whether complement C3 regard predictive factor postoperative outcome postoperative patient gastric cancer . This study design prospective cohort study include consecutively treat patient . The perioperative plasma value complement component , C3 , C4 , CH50 , detect explore incidence rate complement depletion . All enrol patient divide two group mainly accord level preoperative C3 level ( C3 depletion Non-C3 depletion group ) . The primary endpoint 1-year overall survival disease-free survival , secondary endpoint postoperative complication , length hospital stay , hospital charge . This study would helpful confirm role complement depletion anticipate outcomes postoperative patient gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
