	<detailed_description>This investigation involve 8 week randomise , balance , double blind parallel group between-subjects design aim analyse effect combine exercise post exercise nutrition strategy ( hydrolysates meat protein , whey protein isocaloric carbohydrate placebo ) training outcome , marker immunity health period regular training feed intervention . Participants divide three-treatment group 1 ) Hydrolysed meat-protein ( MEAT ) ; 2 ) Whey ( W ) 3 ) non-protein iso-energetic placebo ( CHO ) . Once consider eligible study , initial familiarisation period baseline test , participant randomly assign one intervention group : MEAT ; W CHO . Each group follow 8-week periodised resistance training intervention combine one three specific supplementation treatment ( MEAT , W CHO ) . Measurements general marker health , immunity , body composition , muscle structure performance determine train intervention . Once informed consent health history obtain , baseline Assessment ( t1 ) , participant divide three similar profile group , match body mass , age , sex performance . 1 ) The meat protein group ( MEAT n=10 ) take 250 ml orange juice mix 20g hydrolysate meat protein powder water 2 ) The whey group ( n=10 ) take 20 g whey intact isolate powder mix 250 ml orange juice water 3 ) contrast group ( P n=10 ) take iso-energetic non-protein , carbohydrate ( maltodextrin ) placebo . Participants : Thirty participant , recruit University Campus , take part project . After informed risk , discomfort , benefit involve , participant sign write informed consent regard participation . Intervention Familiarization period : Participants undertake 3 session familiarization ( 1 week ) . A qualified strength condition coach control assist participant order guarantee correct execution select exercise . All participant instruct appropriate use Rate Perceived Exertion ( 0-10 ) scale control load training intensity . Resistance Training : The resistance-training program design increase strength mass major muscle group . The program undertaken three non-consecutive day per week , supervision strength conditioning coach , preferable Strength Conditioning master student . Training workout perform afternoon ( 3pm 6pm ) least 48 hour session . Each session begin individualize warm-up ( 5-minute warm-up stretch , follow one set eight repetition six resistance training exercise without additional weight ) . Workout involve 8 resistance exercise per 3 set 6 10 repetition 70 % 85 % individual 1RM . Exercises perform use free-weights , elastic band , stick machine select stress major muscle group . Resting period around 2 min allow set . Participants instruct maintain proper execution along entire training session . Periodization strategy : The intervention consist 8-week periodised resistance training programme divide 3 block : First block ( 1st 3th week ) use moderate load intensity around 70 % 1RM ; Second block ( 4th 6th week ) intensity increase &gt; 75 % 80 % 1RM third block ( 7th 8th week ) high load ( &gt; 80 85 % 1RM ) use . The Rate Perceive Exertion ( 0-10 ) scale ( RPE ) use appropriately select load along train intervention . Resistance train intervention appropriately integrated regular sport activity perform University athlete along academic period . Supplementation protocol : Training day : Immediately ( &lt; 10 min ) com Non-training day : breakfast . Supplements placebo provide powder form mix standardised orange juice water moment consumption . Supplements placebo look taste identical . Thus , total one 20g dos administer daily base . Participants ingest total 56 dos total 8 week study intervention . Supplement provide 14 day base blind researcher Participants return back empty bag supplement/placebo consume previous 14 day period .</detailed_description>
