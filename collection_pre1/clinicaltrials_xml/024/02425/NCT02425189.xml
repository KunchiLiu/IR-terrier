	<detailed_description>Methods Patients positive LQTS diagnosis family member review collaborate Canadian Inherited Arrhythmia Clinics invite participate registry . Optional bio bank donation offer . Consenting participant blood work drawn local outpatient laboratory . Bio banking collaborate centre do centre bio bank facility site investigator 's discretion . There central bio bank national basis time project . Optional Post Mortem Consent : The next kin ( NOK ) may provide consent include healthcare information decease family member data registry . The NOK may also consent storage post mortem tissue require clinical testing store bio bank future research . Data Collected Clinical data collect willing/consented registry participant . Their healthcare information cod compliance Tri Council Policy Statement criterion : direct identifier remove replaced unique study code use personal information participant 's birth day ( month year include ) , health number , social insurance number name/initials . The coded data transfer research database . The master list registry participant study identifier keep separately research database . This master list store encrypt file within research office site investigator supervision . Only site investigator local research staff access list . The inherited nature condition make master list important sensitive document . It important list maintain participant may contact informed new finding research may reveal may affect family member . All medical information pertain cardiac history inherit arrhythmia patient collect . This may include : - Clinical information - All diagnostic test result - Genetic screening result - Pedigree - Medications - Treatments - Ethnicity Participants continue data collect research database throughout entirety study . Participants able decline participation registry time . The Research Steering Committee review data registry annually assess integrity data usefulness continue data collection . They also review relate research project data may useful . The registry contain store image graphic , test result report would permit identification individual subject . The registry may contain procedural image cod per TCPS criterion previously describe participant ' data biological sample . Follow-up : Patients follow base severity presentation ( previous cardiac arrest arrhythmic syncope , family cascade screen ) . Vital status ( cadiac event ) determine person telephone annually patient enrol . As per standard care , participant previous cardiac arrest arrhythmic syncope beta-blockers follow person every 12 month ( Group 1 ) , asymptomatic patient , free syncope beta blocker , gene negative unaffected family member ( Group 2 ) every 2 year ( discretion site investigator ) . An annual resting ECG possible participant , exercise testing repeat every 2 year Group 1 , every 3-4 year Group 2 base clinical practice enrol centre . Research Database The database host University British Columbia Research Server . This research institute compliance National Canadian/Provincial PIPEDA privacy guideline . Data enter directly e-CRFs electronic submission password protect internet-based server locate University British Columbia Research DNS : cio.ciahealth.org IP Address : 142.103.184.100 Server : UBCIT Virtual Server Location : UBC University Data Center ( UDC ) Pharmaceutical Sciences Building 2405 Wesbrook Mall , Vancouver , BC V6T1Z3 Institute , house Kelowna BC campus collect personal identifier . Individual subject medical information obtain result registry consider confidential disclosure third party prohibit except follow reason : relevant medical information may give subject 's personal physician appropriate medical personnel responsible participant 's welfare . Bio Bank Biological sample cod compliance Tri Council Policy Statement criterion : direct identifier remove replaced unique study code use personal information participant 's birth date , health number , social insurance number name/initials . The coded biological sample store James Hogg Research Centre St. Paul 's Hospital Vancouver , British Columbia . The coded sample link master list keep securely research office collaborate site investigator . Only site investigator local research staff access master list . Blood Samples drawn : 1 X 9 ml EDTA Samples bio banking store long-term James Hogg Research Centre ( JHRC ) Bio Bank St. Paul 's Hospital Vancouver future research . Specimens stored -20 -80 degree freezer locate secure area within JHRC . The freezer dedicate , electronically monitor room manage JHRC . Inventory management include retrieve sample , report inventory sample history , track sample FreezerWorks Unlimited software . Post mortem sample require clinical purpose may store Bio Bank future research . In case , sample use research NOK agreement use sample . The investigator responsible notify NOK sample relocate purpose propose . Written documentation notification consent proceed NOK require . The NOK responsible keep enrol centre date contact information contact future use sample feasible . The investigator diligent attempt notify NOK may feasible case . Database/bio bank access Oversight Dr. Andrew Krahn ultimate responsibility database/bio bank . Investigators wish access use certain data/specimens registry/bio bank submit request Dr. Krahn Steering Committee review approval . Institutional ethic review approval require new project . Projects retrospective data review need seek inform consent participant data extract database . The National Long QT Syndrome Registry Bio bank Research Steering Committee The Steering Committee ( SC ) responsible design , execution , analysis , report study , assign appropriate responsibility study committee . The SC monitor study progress , execution management . The SC comprise Principal Investigator ( Chair ) , Data/Bio Specimen Steward , co applicant . The team compose 9 adult electrophysiologists ( EPs ) oversee inherit arrhythmia clinic ( Drs . Matthew Bennett , Martin Gardner , Brenda Gerull , Jeff Healey , George Klein , Andrew Krahn , Zak Laksman , Danna Spears , Mario Talajic ) , 3 counterpart pediatric EPs ( Robert Hamilton , Shubhayan Sanatani , Robert Gow ) . The SC generate annual report outline study 's contribution scientific community usefulness data . A formal Data Safety Monitoring Committee create registry without plan therapeutic comparative study . Requests future use share data/specimens evaluate accord follow criterion : - The objective hypothesis propose research relation establish emerge basic clinical science - The propose research 's scientific , clinical medical importance translational potential - Commitment provide publication presentation copy primary research data supplement complement registry information - The propose test 's research 's unique nature importance validation LQTS - The propose research 's duration , demographic , patient population , health economic situation , probability success - Whether potential benefit application local international scope - The quantity study data require commitment reimburse full cost associate delivery study data - The contribution applicant make registry Data/Specimen Sharing In addition research carry Study Team , data/specimens may share researcher university ; aggregate cod data would release purpose . These data/specimens may use variety source . Prior data/specimen release , SC review write request access . It anticipate may request pool de-identified data/specimens data/specimens Canadian international registries/banks order answer investigator initiated question patient selection , rare event , long term outcome . Statistical Analysis At phase plan statistical analysis . Descriptive analysis perform entire cohort , standard statistical approach use . The current REB application focus permission prospectively collect data/specimens participant store cod repository . Ethical Considerations Participants project aware may hear individual result ( deceased NOK 's ) research data bio specimen . However , possible may future research finding investigator may oblige inform individual participant . These would include finding affect heart health participant and/or first-degree family member . Participants aware may contact future finding may affect heart health care . Future Research This national approach case find management represent step towards population-based approach study `` rare '' disease ( 1:2500 ) . The knowledge translation strategy aim enhance public health care professional awareness warning sign , deliver structured history ass risk , improve ECG interpretation skill . This imperative begin health system approach recognition LQTS .</detailed_description>
