	<brief_summary>This study conduct build library prospectively collected clinical data subject iron overload examine commercially available MRI device . This data library intend use future engineering development research activity , include future regulatory submission . Data human subject require develop test Magnetic resonance ( MR ) reconstruction technique provide quantitative information tissue property , volumetric fat iron concentration . Collection MR data correspond quantitative liver iron concentration ( LIC ) data necessary development MR techniques show overall regional iron concentration vivo tissue . These technique may provide viable alternative invasive expensive conventional liver biopsy less accurate serum biomarker testing , potentially benefit future clinical patient iron overload . MR image data correspond quantitative data serum liver iron level collect subject study . These datasets consider suitable future development test MR reconstruction software , include MR reconstruction algorithm develop General Electric Healthcare ( GEHC ) use Longitudinal relaxation rate equal reciprocal T2 relaxation time ( 1/T2 ) ( R2 ) techniques assess LIC . To achieve sufficiently diverse library future testing , MRI data liver surround tissue acquire use 1.5T 3.0T GEHC IDEAL IQ scan commercially available 1.5T MRI scan conduct accord FerriScan® Specialized Reconstruction Service guideline ( Resonance Health , Claremont , AU ) . Quantitative hematologic ( serum ferritin ) base blood test FerriScan® Analysis Service LIC report collect subject .</brief_summary>
