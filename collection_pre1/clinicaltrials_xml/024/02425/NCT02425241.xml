	<brief_summary>This clinical proof-of-concept ( PoC ) study DNA vaccination SAP depletion . The investigator measure immune response DNA vaccination HIV-1 healthy adult male volunteer , compare group SAP completely deplete time DNA vaccination control group vaccinate without SAP depletion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depletion Serum Amyloid P Component Enhance Immune Response DNA Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccination one important achievement medicine . Injection modify germ , material , induces protective immunity infection cause . Successful immunisation induces protective immune response particular component ( ) target germ , so-called immunogen ( ) . For disease immunogen know others difficult expensive produce , transport administer , example influenza vaccine must produce million chicken eggs . A attractive potential solution inject deoxyribose nucleic acid ( DNA ) gene encode immunogen rather immunogen . In process , know DNA vaccination , DNA enter cell , predominantly site injection , cause produce immunogen locally within body . DNA vaccination work well stimulates excellent protective immunity variety different infection , even cancer , mouse , horse , dog , rabbit pig . But human primate , cow sheep , immune response DNA vaccination feeble . Despite enormous academic pharmaceutical industry effort , reason failure understood overcome . The investigator previously discover protein human blood , know serum amyloid P component ( SAP ) , normal blood protein bind strongly DNA . The investigator find , animal specie DNA vaccination effective , protein either absent , present , bind weakly DNA . In contrast , nonhuman primate , cow sheep share human presence SAP proteins strongly bind DNA . The investigator believe bind DNA SAP may responsible block induction immune response DNA removal SAP may overcome inhibition . SAP contribute important human disease , amyloidosis Alzheimer 's disease , investigator previously develop drug , ( R ) -1- [ 6- [ ( R ) -2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl ] -6-oxohexanoyl ] pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid ( CPHPC ) , safely remove almost SAP blood human . Another laboratory recently report presence human SAP inhibits DNA vaccination mouse effect reverse investigator drug , CPHPC . These observation confirm investigator hypothesis . The investigator propose undertake first human clinical study DNA vaccination SAP depletion . The investigator measure immune response human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 DNA vaccination 40 healthy adult men , compare group SAP completely deplete time DNA vaccination control group vaccinate without SAP depletion . The investigator predict SAP depletion time DNA vaccination enhance immune response . Development effective , accessible vaccine realistic hope halt human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) /AIDS epidemic . Ideally , vaccine induce broadly neutralizing antibody effective T cell time . Both goal face substantial different challenge , one major roadblock common : enormous HIV-1 genome plasticity , i.e . ability change escape immune response . There need develop vaccine may use prophylactically therapeutically either prevent HIV-1 acquisition , control replication without HAART and/or eventually eradicate virus body completely . The approach take clinical study aim overcome antigenic variation HIV-1 focusing induce T cell response functionally conserve region HIV-1 protein , HIV-1 change without significant cost fitness . Thus , HIVconsv immunogen chimaeric protein assemble 14 conserved region HIV-1 proteome alternate among four common HIV-1 clade : A , B , C D. The gene cod HIVconsv make synthetically inserted three safe non-replicating vaccine vector : plasmid DNA construct pSG2.HIVconsv , attenuate chimpanzee adenovirus ( ChAdV63 ) construct ChAdV63.HIVconsv recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) construct MVA.HIVconsv . These three vector facilitate delivery immunogen gene host cell , express HIVconsv protein initiate series process leading presentation HIVconsv-derived peptide cell host immune system induction HIVconsv-specific host T cell response . Volunteers receive vaccine candidate ChAdV63.HIVconsv ( C ) , MVA.HIVconsv ( M ) pSG2.HIVconsv DNA ( D ) DDDCM regimen week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 . CPHPC placebo give 26 hour infusion prior pSG2.HIVconsv vaccination .</detailed_description>
