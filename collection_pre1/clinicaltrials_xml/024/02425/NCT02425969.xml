	<brief_title>A Trial Stable Intermediate Coronary Lesions Grey-zone FFR Values</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure derive fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) recognise gold standard method assess physiological significance angiographically intermediate lesion . A grey-zone exists originally validate cut-off ischemia &lt; 0.75 conventionally adopt cut- ≤0.80 . Pilot data centre suggest 1 3 coronary artery grey-zone FFR value demonstrate myocardial perfusion defect stress cardiac MRI others suggest clinical outcome patient grey-zone FFR favorable medical therapy alone . As , stenting lesion grey-zone FFR ( currently recommend ) may represent over-treatment could attenuate overall benefit FFR strategy . In addition flow derive resistance index stenosis severity superior diagnostic accuracy may helpful correctly classify patient grey-zone FFR . In study comprehensive analysis lesion grey-zone FFR value ( 0.75-0.82 inclusive ) use invasive hyperemic pressure , flow resistance derive index severity quantitative qualitative 3T perfusion MRI enable identification best invasive predictor true perfusion defect 3T cardiac MRI . Patients randomise optimal medical therapy alone versus optimal medical therapy PCI follow primary endpoint anginal control measure Seattle Angina Questionnaire 3 month .</detailed_description>
