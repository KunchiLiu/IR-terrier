	<brief_summary>Background : Radiotherapy common treatment many malignancy . Radiation-related complication develop month year radiation treatment know late radiation tissue injury ( LRTI ) estimate effect 5 % -15 % long-term survivor receive radiation . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) well establish treatment LRTI . Most study evaluate effect HBOT LRTI focus survival , resolution tissue damage improvement LENT-SOMA scale . Very study address effect HBOT pain LTRI . Krahn colleague first report analgesic effect HBOT 3 case refractory pain oncological patient radiation soft tissue injury . Other study show significant improvement pain intensity patient breast cancer pelvic malignancy treat HBOT LTRI . In patient develop radiation- induced brachial plexopathy , HBOT elicit increase warm pain threshold reduction lymphoedema . A prospective case study 16 patient gynecological cancer find change respect pain depression outcome . A trial patient radiation induce proctopathy show 75 % patient rectal pain improvement , although none experience complete resolution pain symptom . There several mechanism HBOT may elicit analgesic effect . There grow body evidence HBOT 's analgesic effect relate nitric oxide metabolism endogenous opioid secretion . Furthermore , inhibition tumor necrosis factor alph ( TNF-α ) , production substance P , modulation serotonergic pathway demonstrate modification pain response follow HBOT . In animal study HBOT decrease allodynia hyperalgesia different model neuropathic inflammatory pain . The long lasting antinociceptive effect HBOT find dose-dependent non-injured tissue . In human study , HBOT decrease pain edema improve function patient suffer complex regional pain syndrome , improve pain score range motion patient idiopathic femoral head necrosis . Women suffer interstitial cystitis demonstrate reduction pelvic pain follow week month HBOT treatment . In patient suffer idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia HBOT produce rapid reduction symptom effect last 6 month follow treatment . HBOT also find effective treatment cluster headache migraine alleviate muscle bone pain patient myofascial syndrome , fibromyalgia , biphosphonate-related osteonecrosis jaw . Based evidence present HBOT 's know analgesic effect many condition , investigator design study objective evaluate HBOT reduce pain , improve depression impact patient quality life patient suffer late radiation tissue injury . Study Design : Prospective observational study ( n=300 ) . Patients radiation therapy malignancy , develop late radiation injury suffer chronic pain .</brief_summary>
