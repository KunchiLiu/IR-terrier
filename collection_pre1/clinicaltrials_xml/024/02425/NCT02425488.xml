	<brief_summary>Purpose : Heart Failure ( HF ) clinical multifactorial syndrome , cause arrhythmias international guideline suggest implantation implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) . The educational nursing program would improve clinical outcome patient HF ICD like control sickness , know acknowledge symptom , improve skill self-care . The main aim study assess much nursing-therapeutics skill educational intervention , patient HF follow-up period implantation ICD reduce clinical cost , re-hospitalizations , mortality 180 day . Methods : The investigator start multicenter randomize clinical trial . The sample make 128 subject ( 64 patient treatment group 64 control group ) . The investigator measure self-care level administer HF patient `` Self-Care Heart Failure Index ( SCHFI ) v. 6.2 '' , self-perception life quality use Numeric Rating Scale 0 100 . Secondary outcome record ) number access ED ( Emergency Department ) and/or hospitalization follow-up period , ii ) mortality rate due HF , iii ) infection rate device pocket . Data Analysis : Categorical variable present term frequency percentage . The statistical power fix 80 % . Data consider significant p-value ≤ 0.05 . The Cox proportional hazard model use analyze mortality subject involve educational program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nursing Therapeutics Education Heart Failure ( HF ) : Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims study The aim study examine effect nurse intervention consist sanitary-therapeutic education follow-up period implantation defibrillator ( ICD ) patient congestive heart failure . The effectiveness educational intervention assess basis level `` self-care '' every individual lifestyle well mortality rate , readmission hospital ICD pocket infection . Educational intervention focus 1 . Appropriate lifestyle 2 . Early recognition signs/prodromal symptom HF 3 . Early recognition sign inflammation ICD-pocket 4 . Good management device 1 . Therapy , body weight , diet , smoking , alcohol , rest , exercise , job , sex 2 . Dyspnea , edema , fovea , rapid weight gain , loss appetite , fatigue , asthenia , insomnia , mental confusion 3 . Signs symptoms inflammation : hyperpyrexia , rubor , dolor , calor tumor 4 . Identification tag , vibration , metal detector , air travel , use electronic device , diagnostic PET MRI Materials methods A multicenter randomize control study perform . The research project involve two clinical center northern Italy : `` Città della Salute e della Scienza '' University Hospital Turin , include `` Molinette '' Hospital ( coordinator center ) , TO3 ASL , include `` Associated Hospitals Rivoli '' . Subject recruitment data collection take place data saturation achieve , estimated period approximately 12 month begin study . Participants Inclusion criterion : • Patients affect heart failure follow elective hospitalization ICD implant arrhythmic and/or ischemic basis . • Patients give write consent research . Exclusion criterion : - Patients syndromes disease compromise understand information , learn cognitive activity general . - Minors . Primary outcome measure • Self-care level ( measure use Self-Care Heart Failure Index , SCHFI v 6.2 ) • Quality life perception ( measure use numerical rating scale 0 100 ) Secondary outcome measure • Number visit ED ( Emergency Department ) and/or hospitalization follow-up period implantation defibrillator ( ICD ) . - Mortality rate 180 day implantation ICD due HF-related cause . - Infection rate device pocket . Data , source collection tool • Socio-demographic clinical data : For included patient , demographic ( gender , age , educational level , marital status , country birth ( Italian citizen foreigner ) , social ( family context survey ) clinical ( classification HF use NYHA classification , implantation date type ICD , execution change laboratory test electrocardiograms result , number perceive discharge ) data record . Data patient 's diagnosis possible associate disease obtain analysis clinical documentation record accordance International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems , 9th Revision ( ICD-IX ) . • Economic data : For patient include study , follow data collect : • economic activity , occupational qualification ( employed/ex-employed ) ; • visit ED and/or hospitalization follow-up period , verified analysis administrative documentation certify visit admission ( Verbal First Aid Medical record ) ; • presence companion patient stay ED hospital well economic activity professional qualification ; - cost directly incur patient companion ; - time spent nursing figure provide therapeutic education . From society 's point view , benefit receive ED hospitalization assess accord charge currently force Italy . Indirect cost , represent time spent patient , cost related time spend caregiver valorized use value publish official source ISTAT . Costs directly charge patient value basis state cost . Finally , cost time spend educational activity assess use hourly average cost nurse and/or doctor clinical center participate study . - Self-Care Heart Failure Index ( SCHFI ) version 6.2 . A tool validate Italian context allow evaluation patient 's awareness capacity self-care11 . The obtained response organize four-level Likert scale ( 1 = never , 4 = every day ) . Specifically , instrument divide three section : Section A : ( question 1 10 ) investigate self-care skill ; Section B : ( question 11 16 ) investigate individual 's symptomatology recognition skill ; Section C : ( question 17 22 ) investigate self-confidence related self-care skill detail . The total score compute follow manner : Section A : 10 subtract sum section result consider answer 1 10 , result multiply coefficient 3.33 ; Section B : 4 subtract sum section result consider answer 11 16 , result multiply coefficient 5 ; Section C : 6 subtract sum section result consider answer 17 22 , result multiply coefficient 5.56 All result consider term percentage . If percentage individual section higher cut-off value ( 70 % ) , accord literature11 , level self-care consider adequate . Otherwise , low value , section show insufficient result strengthen . - Numeric Rating Scale : scale 0 100 use subjective measurement perceive quality life . This tool evaluate committee expert use pre-test , currently way .</detailed_description>
