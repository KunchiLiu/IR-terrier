	<detailed_description>This single-center , single-arm , open-label , prospective phase 2 trial ass efficacy localize concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) sorafenib sequential therapy subject advance HCC . Approximately 47 subject enrol receive CCRT sorafenib sequentially all-cause mortality . Sorafenib current standard care advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient follow clinical result two pivotal trial Western Asian patient . The median overall survival patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) treat sorafenib show approximately 14 month . However presence portal vein invasion extrahepatic metastasis , median overall survival significantly lower 5.6 - 8.9 month . Going forward , improvement patient-related outcome would highly desirable . A pilot study conduct subject advanced HCC portal vein invasion effective therapeutic method establish . This single-center , open-label study localize concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) locally advanced HCC patient portal vein invasion . A total 40 subject advance HCC portal vein invasion enrol . The subject treat total 45 Gy external beam radiotherapy ( 1.8 Gy per session , 5 session week , 5 week ) , hepatic arterial infusion 5-flourouracil ( 5-FU ) first last 5 day radiation therapy ( 5-FU 500 mg infusion 5 hour ) pre-inserted chemoport . Eighteen ( 45 % ) subject objective tumor response 1 month completion localize CCRT . The 3-year survival rate 24.2 % median overall survival 13.1 month . Treatment-related serious adverse event ( CTCAE grade 3 high ) anemia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , mucositis liver decompensation , rate 2.5 % , 2.4-5.0 % , 17.5 % , 10 % 7.3-17.5 % , respectively . In addition , 2.4-5.0 % adverse event chemoport-related adverse event include infection port obstruction . Although sorafenib show increase overall survival advance HCC patient compare placebo anti-angiogenesis effect , tumoricidal effect evident . Meanwhile , base analysis pilot study , localize CCRT regard promising treatment tumoricidal effect advance HCC patient . Therefore , combine sorafenib treatment CCRT anticipate augment anti-tumor effect improve tumor response median overall survival .</detailed_description>
