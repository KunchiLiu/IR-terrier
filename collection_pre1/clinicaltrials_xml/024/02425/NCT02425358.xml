	<brief_summary>Most study intracoronary bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMC ) transplantation acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) involve treatment 3-7 day primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ; however , optimal time unknown . The present study assess therapeutic effect different time ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timing Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells After Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On basis experimental study bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMCs ) transfer injured tissue promote regional myocardial perfusion improve cardiac function , several clinical trial show intracoronary bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMC ) transplantation acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) patient several day myocardial reperfusion safe may enhance improvement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . The timing BMC administration , baseline LVEF , dosage BMC factor link improvement LVEF BMC transplantation . In previous work , give BMCs within 24 hour emergency percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) find safe effective . In addition , another report long time symptom onset BMC infusion ( 2-4 week ) , also appear effective . The timing intracoronary stem cell administration may critical effect cell engraftment may responsible various biological functional response therapy . However , study directly address optimal timing cell injection . Therefore , prospective randomize study , BMCs give different time ( within 24 hour , 3 7 day , 7 30 day reperfusion ) investigate whether time therapy affect therapeutic response AMI patient .</detailed_description>
