	<brief_summary>Muscle relaxant medication use surgery facilitate surgical access . The effect muscle relaxant medication measure stimulation motor nerve measure force resultant muscle contraction . Based mechanism action , two kind muscle relaxant describe . First nondepolarizing muscle relaxant second kind depolarize muscle relaxant . These two kind muscle relaxant distinguish rapidly stimulate nerve 4 time 2 second ( Train four TOF ) . The nondepolarizing muscle relaxant produce fade ie successive muscle contraction less forceful precede one . Whereas depolarize muscle relaxant generally believe produce four contraction equal strength . However , indication may entirely correct . There evidence depolarize muscle relaxant also may produce fade . The investigator conduct follow study determine indeed depolarize muscle relaxant produce fade . The investigator would also like characterize fade ie difference onset offset block effect dose degree fade .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fade Upon TOF Stimulation Induced Succinylcholine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant frequently employ anesthesia . These medication may employ facilitate tracheal intubation , mechanical ventilation allow good surgical access . All muscle relaxant act neuromuscular junction . Based mechanism action , two kind muscle relaxant defined1 . Nondepolarizing muscle relaxant competitive antagonist neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( Ach ) neuromuscular junction . The second kind muscle relaxant depolarize muscle relaxant succinylcholine muscle relaxant class clinically use . The mechanism action succinylcholine less clear . Succinylcholine appear mimic action acetylcholine result long duration depolarization post synaptic membrane1 . The degree muscle relaxation produce muscle relaxant measure stimulate motor nerve measure either force muscle contraction produce compound muscle action potential ( CMAP ) . As muscle relaxation increase , force muscle contraction amplitude electromyogram ( EMG ) correspondingly reduce . On occasion , measure degree muscle weakness paralysis cause muscle relaxant , instead single stimulus , train stimuli applied2 . One method repetitive stimulation apply four stimulus two second period . This method nerve stimulation call Train-of-Four ( TOF ) . When form nerve stimulation ( TOF ) apply patient give nondepolarizing muscle relaxant -there fade . Fade mean force successive muscle contraction less precede contraction3 . The second contraction less first , third less second . The degree fade appear reasonably well define relationship degree relaxation produced3 . The classic teaching anesthetic literature depolarize muscle relaxant produce fade upon repetitive stimulation . It mean upon repetitive stimulation , successive contraction similar . This one defining feature depolarize block call Phase I block . The traditional teaching depolarize muscle relaxant administer large repetitive dos , Phase II block develops . The phase II block characteristic similar nondepolarizing muscle relaxant ( ie fade repetitive TOF stimulation ) . De Jong Freund first propose differentiation deplolarizing nondepolarizing block base upon fade may clear cut . These investigator demonstrate succinylcholine cause fade upon repetitive stimulation right outset neuromuscular block . Other investigator also demonstrate succinylcholine cause fade initiation neuromuscular block . If conclusively demonstrate succinylcholine cause fade , fade would less useful differentiate depolarize nondepolarizing block . We previously investigate defined fade cause nondepolarizing muscle relaxant . Using experience gain study fade nondepolarizing muscle relaxant , would like define characteristic fade ( ) cause succinylcholine . Method : We intend enroll fifty healthy adult , 18-60 year age either sex schedule undergo surgical procedure general anesthesia . Only subject BMI &lt; 25 Kg/m2 enrol . Only subject free hepatic renal disease include . We exclude subject know allergy succinylcholine , family history malignant hyperthermia history skeletal myopathy . We also exclude subject recently sustain burn , illness result denervation injury ( paraplegia hemiplegia ) . The subject give inform consent prior participation study . All patient receive 2 mg midazolam premedication . Anesthesia induce intravenous administration fentanyl 5-6 µg/kg propofol 2-3 mg/kg . Following tracheal intubation , anesthesia maintain 70 % nitrous oxide oxygen supplement infusion propofol ( 120 -150 µg/kg/min ) . Ventilation control maintain normocapnia ( end-tidal carbon di oxide 35-40 mmHg ) . After commencement anesthesia monitoring neuromuscular transmission commence . Ulnar nerve wrist stimulate TOF sequence ( 2 Hz every 12 second ) . The resultant force contraction adductor pollicis record use mechanomyograph . After obtain stable muscle contraction , succinylcholine administer . The subject randomly allocate one five group . Group 1 receive 0.1 mg/kg , group 2 -0.15 mg/kg , group 3 -0.2 mg/kg , group 4 -0.25 mg/kg , group 5 -0.3 mg/kg . Muscle contraction record force muscle contraction return baseline ( 6-8 minute ) . At time study conclude . Further conduct anesthetic discretion subject 's primary anesthesiologist . Data Analysis : We intend plot force four muscle contraction immediately precede injection succinylcholine complete recovery muscle contraction . We would plot force first twitch ( T1 ) ratio fourth first twitch ( T4/T1 ratio ) individual subject . This plot allow u determine difference fade characteristic onset offset muscle relaxant effect .</detailed_description>
