	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study use human prostate tissue model maintain study prostate cancer stem cell . A human prostate tissue model use leftover tissue remove surgery patient non-cancerous enlargement prostate ( benign prostatic hyperplasia ) may create environment similar natural environment human body . Prostate cancer stem cell cell cause cancer grow . Using real tissue create environment study stem cell may help doctor learn work respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To optimize decellularized prostate tissue model maintenance prostate cancer stem cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate self-renewal differentiation ability human prostate cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) ( tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 [ TROP2 ] + cell ) mention decellularized prostate tissue model . II . To compare number CSCs accord key patient characteristic , include race , age , Gleason , metastasis status , previous cancer treatment ( ) . OUTLINE : Tissue sample collect patient benign prostatic hyperplasia decellularization preparation human extracellular matrix grow human prostate CSCs . Tissue sample also collect patient prostate cancer analysis TROP2+ cell flow cytometry .</detailed_description>
