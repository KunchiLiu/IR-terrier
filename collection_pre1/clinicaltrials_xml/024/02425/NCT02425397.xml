	<brief_summary>A limited number relatively contradictory study suggest development serious ototoxicity child treat cisplatin , rarely , carboplatin could partly relate genetic risk factor affect detoxification enzyme membrane transporter platinum derivative . The objective study therefore identify genetic variant associate development platinum ototoxicity patient treat cisplatin carboplatin ( minimum follow-up 3 year ) one follow disease : neuroblastoma , hepatoblastoma , retinoblastoma , malignant germ cell tumour , osteosarcoma , high-risk recurrent Wilms ' tumour , non-parameningealrhabdomyosarcoma . A total 180 patient , correspond 60 case grade 3 4 ototoxicity 120 control sign ototoxicity ( separate complete audiogram ear ) include . A saliva sample use obtain DNA pharmacogenetic study . The value study define population high risk develop ototoxicity order adapt treatment , even develop preventive treatment ototoxicity base antioxidant medication</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Platinum derivative toxicity Cisplatin , carboplatin , oxaliplatin major cytotoxic agent use treatment many type cancer . They exert cytotoxic action form DNA adduct . However , structural difference confer different pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property , especially different toxicity profile . Cisplatin induce risk nephrotoxicity age , peripheral neuropathy extremity young adult risk ototoxicity child . Carboplatin essentially haematotoxic sometimes ototoxic ( especially high dos ) , oxaliplatin essentially neurotoxic . Ototoxicity measure pure-tone audiometry score grade 0 grade 4 , grade 3 4 correspond severe ototoxicity , accord Brock grading system , reference system measure ototoxicity time treatment child present time ( Brock et al. , 1991 ) ( Peters et al. , 2000 ) . Ototoxicity limit cumulative dose platinum derivative child . Cisplatin remain major drug paediatric oncology ( osteosarcoma , high-risk neuroblastoma , malignant germ cell tumour , hepatoblastoma , medulloblastoma , brain tumour ) . Cisplatin ototoxicity fairly frequent severe ( 50 % grade 1 high ototoxicity ; 15 % grade 3 4 ototoxicity ) ( Bertolini et al. , 2004 ) . Carboplatin , important component treatment many embryonal tumour ( neuroblastoma , medulloblastoma , retinoblastoma ) less frequently responsible ototoxicity ( 1 5 % grade 1 high ototoxicity ) , nevertheless occasionally cause serious ototoxicity ( 1 % grade 4 ) ( Jehanne et al. , 2009 ) . Ototoxicity also appear deteriorate several year treatment ( median time discovery carboplatin ototoxicity : 3.7 year ) , case recovery high-grade hearing loss report ( Bertolini et al. , 2004 ; Jehanne et al. , 2009 ) . These ototoxicity phenomena harmful consequence child 's social development school . Oxaliplatin exclude study , child currently treat molecule , generally ototoxic . - Detoxification platinum derivatives The glutathione ( GSH ) conjugation pathway involved detoxification platinum derivative decrease cytotoxicity inhibit formation DNA adduct . Conjugation GSH ensure glutathione-S-transferases ( GSTs ) , constitute multigenic family enzyme involve phase II metabolism inactivate electrophilic molecule conjugate glutathione , thereby promote elimination . GSTP1 particularly involved conjugation platinum derivative . Elimination glutathione conjugate involve membrane transporter . These conjugate expel target tumour cell eliminate , essentially urine , efflux membrane transporter , particularly MRP2 ( Sun et al. , 2009 ) . Two enzyme , thiopurine S-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) catechol O-methyltransferase , report associate increased toxicity cisplatin activity decrease ( Ross et al. , 2009 ) . - Genetic factor predispose protect toxicity platinum derivative Several GST isoenzymes present polymorphism modify activity . This case GSTM1 GSTT1 isoenzymes , undergo deletion responsible loss activity enzyme , GSTM3 , GSTM3*B allele associate induction enzyme activity cisplatin ( Peters et al. , 2000 ) . An A/G polymorphism situate substrate binding domain GSTP1 isoenzyme position +313 exon 5 ( A313G ) induce substitution isoleucine valine ( Ile105Val ) . This polymorphism relatively frequent ( 10 % homozygous mutant Caucasian population ) . It influence activity enzyme associate well survival patient receive platinum-based chemotherapy ( Goekkurt et al. , 2006 ; Stoehlmacher et al. , 2002 ; Sun et al. , 2009 ) . This polymorphism also show influence toxicity platinum-based treatment . For example , one study show neurotoxicity oxaliplatin frequent subject homozygous GSTP1 105Ile allele heterozygous subject subject homozygous GSTP1 105Val allele ( odds ratio = 5.75 ) . ( Lecomte et al. , 2006 ) . This protective effect mutant allele also demonstrate docetaxel peripheral neuropathy ( odds ratio = 6.11 ) cisplatin ototoxicity testicular cancer young men ( Mir et al. , 2009 ; Oldenburg et al. , 2007 ) . A study conduct child demonstrate association GSTM1 GSTT1 polymorphism ( presence least one null genotype ) development grade 3 high toxicity relate treatment medulloblastoma . However , study , base small sample child ( 42 child , 19 experience severe ototoxicity ) comprise patient receive different treatment , unable determine proportion toxicity specifically related platinum derivative , patient also receive brain irradiation . Furthermore , association GST polymorphisms toxicity observe analysis specifically confine grade 3 high ototoxicity . Finally , role GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism evaluate child ( Barahmani et al. , 2009 ) . To knowledge , one study specifically evaluate potential impact GST polymorphism cisplatin ototoxicity child . This study show protective effect GSTM3*B variant , observe protective effect GSTP1 105Val allele respect ototoxicity , demonstrate adults neurotoxicity . However , finding base small sample size ( 20 patient ototoxicity versus 19 patient without ototoxicity ) ototoxicity experience patient grade 2 ( 8 patient ) 3 ( 12 patient ) case grade 4 ototoxicity ( Peters et al. , 2000 ) . The result study therefore need confirm study comprise great number patient , case control , include patient severe ototoxicity . Ross et al. , study drug metabolism enzyme , demonstrate highly significant association cisplatin ototoxicity child genetic variant TPMT ( rs12201199 , p = 0.00022 , OR = 17.0 ) COMT ( rs9332377 , p = 0.00018 , OR = 5.5 ) . However , role enzyme detoxification platinum derivative previously report , result need confirmed study , particular , matching age , exclusion case grade 2 ototoxicity group severe ototoxicity , great number control patient ( Ross et al. , 2009 ) . Finally , study investigate genetic factor involve carboplatin ototoxicity child . One study concern membrane transporter show common polymorphism situate promoter region MRP2 ( -24C &gt; T ) transporter gene associate well response platinum-based chemotherapy ( allelic frequency : 18 % Caucasian ) ( Cascorbi , 2006 ; Sun et al. , 2009 ) . It would interest determine whether polymorphisms affect gene also modulate toxicity treatment . A polymorphism gene cod influx transporter OCT2 ( c.808G &gt; T ; p.270Ala &gt; Ser ) also show associate vivo vitro mouse protective effect relation cisplatin nephrotoxicity ototoxicity ( Ciarimboli et al . ; Filipski et al. , 2009 ) , potential influence polymorphism platinum ototoxicity never demonstrate man . It therefore appear interesting study potential impact polymorphism context study . In summary , study clearly confirm hypothesis genetic factor involve predisposition child experience harmful ototoxic effect platinum derivative , particularly cisplatin carboplatin . These study also suggest existence good candidate gene variant likely associate development ototoxicity . However , result study either reproduce remain controversial , indicate need confirmation study base large sample size homogeneous patient group term treatment , Otoplat study .</detailed_description>
