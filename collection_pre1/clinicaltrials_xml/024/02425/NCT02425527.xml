	<brief_title>Digital Gaming Persons With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study use pragmatic , randomize control trial three arm . The study conduct within Turku University Hospital , Division Clinical Neurosciences ( Operational Division Clinical Neurosciences , Department Rehabilitation Brain Trauma collaboration former neurology outpatient clinic rehabilitation unit university hospital ) . The Division specialize demand neurological psychiatric inpatient rehabilitation , inter-professional neurological education , rehabilitative examination , inpatient outpatient care traumatic brain injury . In year , 500 patient admit Division service unit . The recruitment focus patient discharge Turku University Hospital , Division Clinical Neurosciences least one year start day recruitment process . Based previous literature , use game longer intervention facilitate training provided person ' home , due easy access reduce impact school work activity ( Burbea et al . 2011 ) . The randomisation patient allocation fully centralize ; use central randomization service University Turku . The randomization target patient hospitalize Turku University Hospital register Hospital electronic medical record . The study individually randomize . Allocation computer generate . The participant randomly assign number via computerized assignment develop independent Trial Statistician implement Research Assistant train patient randomization data collection . Participants investigator enrol patient recruitment randomization foresee assignment . Allocation mask participant two intervention group ; participant aware game intervention , one experimental comparator . Investigators mask group allocation , data analyst ( outcome assessor ) keep blinded allocation . As far aware , contact participant different group ; participant live wide geographic area catchment area Southwest Hospital District . To capture representative sample patient , Turku University Hospital electronic medical record use . The medical record access authority Chief medical doctor Hospital screen Research Assistant . All patient TBI diagnosis screen find patient fulfill eligibility criterion study participation . Those patient fulfill inclusion criterion contact telephone call Research Assistant . A preliminary description study offer inclusion criterion study describe . The participant able answer whether fulfill specific inclusion criterion preliminary interest toward study ask . Those fulfill inclusion criterion willing participate study , receive postal information study , two item informed consent form , questionnaire fill home ( baseline data ) , short description eight entertainment game use ( allocated control group ) . Further , possible participant aware 1-2 week receive another call Research Assistant . This ensure possible participant enough time read material , ask question , make decision whether participate study ( type game would like play allocate control group ) . During second telephone call , willing participate study get information practical arrangement study place data collection . They also inform travel cost cover time face-to-face meeting may take totally 1-1.5 hour . Participants also aware free withdraw study time . At end telephone call , specific time face-to-face meeting Research Assistant arrange . During face-to-face meeting University Turku , ensure participant fulfill inclusion criterion . If patient fulfills criterion , sign write informed consent returned/obtained . Should person consent , pre-filled baseline data gather . The Research Assistant receive information email , text message telephone call . Cognitive measurement also conduct psychologist . After eligible patient inform Trial Manager allocate patient one three arm trial base computer generate randomization list ( intervention vs. control group vs. `` As-usual '' ) . Recruitment continue require data receive . Criteria feasibility : - Willingness participate 80 % ( refusal rate 20 % ) - We expect 75 % prescheduled measurement would perform ( adherence ) - Less 25 % participant would drop due reason ( adherence ) - The acceptability game use would least 95 % ( intervention control group ) ( adherence ) - Usability evaluation gaming system would least 80 % ( 1 item ; dichotomous scale yes/no ) ( usability ) - More 80 % satisfied game ( 1 item ; dichotomous scale , yes/no ) ( satisfaction ) - We expect 60 % willing use game later part recovery process ( use future ) The calculation sample size need group preliminary estimation guide data collection . This perform two outcome variable use study : ) TMT version A ( Lezak et al . 2004 ) b ) depression ( PHQ-9 , Kroenke et al . 2001 ) . 1 . Let 's assume average level TMT version A score 71 mean change score follow-up 30 . Let 's assume standard deviation TMT score 53 . This difference could expect significant ( power 85 % significant level 0.05 ) sample size group 30 subject . 2 . Let 's assume average level PHQ-9 score 10 mean change score follow-up 3 . Let 's assume standard deviation PHQ-9 score 5 . This difference could expect significant ( power 85 % significant level 0.05 ) sample size group 27 subject . Conclusion : Based preliminary power calculation , sample size use study ( 30/a group ) quite sufficient detect significant within-group change baseline follow-up outcome measure . However , mean attrition rate study near 0 % . The outcome feasibility study use guide estimate sample size future study . The cumulative monitoring data 8-week period regard game total number receive parameter ( frequency , timing , time ) calculate . Information available patient also calculate ( participation/refusal rate , measurement instrument fill , drop-outs , acceptability , usability , satisfaction , willingness ) compare high possible representative number ( 100 % participation rate ; measurement instrument fill , drop-out rate 0 % , acceptability 100 % , usability 100 % , satisfaction 100 % , willingness use game future 100 % ) . For secondary outcome , participant analyse baseline , 8 week intervention finalise , 2 month , scale describe earlier . Paired t-tests Chi square test perform detect significant difference follow treatment one group . Significant difference group evaluate apply unpaired Student 's t-test use conventional 95 % level confidence . In test , p-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
