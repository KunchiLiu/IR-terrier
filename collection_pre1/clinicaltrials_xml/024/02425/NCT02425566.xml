	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand role abdominal vein ( splanchnic capacitance ) sympathetic nervous system human hypertension . The investigator test hypothesis constriction abdominal vein due sympathetic activation contributes human hypertension . Splanchnic capacitance assess normotensive hypertensive subject baseline acute blockade autonomic nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The splanchnic circulation contain highly compliant venous bed normally store ~25 % blood volume , receive 25 % rest cardiac output . It highly innervate sympathetic nervous system , neural regulation result large volume shift modulate blood pressure ( BP ) . The splanchnic circulation may play role hypertension suggest study show surgical splanchnic denervation effectively lower BP hypertensive subject without affect renal function . Recently , study animal model show splanchnic sympathetic activation , particularly capacitance vessel , critical development hypertension . The clinical translation finding human hypertension lag behind limitation previously available experimental approach . The investigator propose use splanchnic radionuclide plethysmography sympathetic withdrawal ganglionic blocker trimethaphan overcome limitation . Several study show sympathetic activity contribute hypertension . Accordingly , previous study show sympathetic withdrawal ganglionic blocker trimethaphan result normalization BP hypertensive subject . Interestingly , cause mainly fall stroke volume , rather decrease arterial vascular resistance suggest decrease venous return may play major role , sympathetically mediate contraction splanchnic capacitance contributes maintenance hypertension . The investigator hypothesize decrease BP induce autonomic blockade trimethaphan result increase splanchnic capacitance lead reduction venous return . To test hypothesis , investigator compare effect sympathetic withdrawal splanchnic capacitance hypertensive normotensive subject . Splanchnic venous capacitance measure radionuclide plethysmography . Abdominal blood volume measure use label red cell technetium-99 apply different level continuous positive airway pressure . In addition , investigator assess whether change splanchnic capacitance measure bioimpedance similar measure radionuclide imaging . For purpose , investigator compare effect nitroglycerin splanchnic capacitance measure two technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Lean obese , male female subject race 18 65 year age . Normotensive hypertensive subject enrol . Hypertension define systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg , take seated position least 2 separate occasion . All subject otherwise normal volunteer . Subjects able willing provide inform consent . Pregnancy . Subjects morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) . Subjects chronic disease ( hypertension ) include diabetes , cardiovascular disease , history smoking , take medication know effect autonomic function , factor investigator 's opinion would prevent subject complete protocol include clinically significant abnormality clinical , mental laboratory test . Current smoker history heavy smoking ( &gt; 2 packs/day ) Lean normotensive subject exclude strong family history hypertension ( parent treat diagnose ) , diagnosis sleep apnea high score Berlin questionnaire sleep apnea , highly trained athlete .</criteria>
