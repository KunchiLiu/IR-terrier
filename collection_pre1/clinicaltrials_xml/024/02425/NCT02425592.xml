	<brief_summary>The objective study determine MRI-identified progression decrease frequency need repeat prostate biopsy men active surveillance ( AS ) . Our hypothesis MRI alone adequate detect progression prostate cancer men active surveillance ( AS ) MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Surveillance Prostate Cancer , Imaging Detect Radiographic Progression Endpoint ( ASPIRE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRI Fusion prostate biopsy transform Active Surveillance ( AS ) men low risk prostate cancer . Treatment prostate cancer , usually surgical removal radiation deliver whole prostate , associate significant morbidity include incontinence impotence . The goal future research maximize effectiveness prostate image order minimize morbidity prostate biopsy hence improve quality life patient prostate cancer . There many application improve image prostate cancer , several investigator interested include : improve risk stratification limit unnecessary treatment provide appropriate treatment prevent progression ; limit number biopsy need diagnosis and/or decrease frequency biopsy hence decrease biopsy-related morbidity ; focal therapy confirm focal disease rather treat entire prostate order limit significant morbidity associate whole-gland treatment . This investigator-initiated , multi-center , prospective observational phase II trial evaluate MRI detect prostate cancer progression patient low risk prostate cancer Active Surveillance . The two center involve Yale-New Haven Hospital Smilow Cancer Center ( Yale ) VA Connecticut Healthcare System ( VACT ) . The Yale School Medicine serve central data-coordinating center study .</detailed_description>
