	<brief_title>Study Colorectal Cancer Patients ( Stage IIIC ) With Either Regorafenib Standard Care ( No Treatment ) After Adjuvant FOLFOX</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Stage IIIC colon cancer 5-year survival rate 28 % . Stage III colon cancer indicate lymph node involve . Adjuvant FOLFOX reduce risk recurrence colorectal cancer 40 % , almost 50 % patient still die disease . It estimate 50 % patient relapse within 18 month . Because prognosis colorectal cancer dependent disease stage metastatic disease incurable , concept add regorafenib adjuvant FOLFOX develop allow patient high-risk colorectal cancer best chance cure . It propose treat high-risk colorectal patient ( Stage IIIC [ T4a , N2a , M0 ] [ T3-4a , N2b , M0 ] , [ T4b , N1-N2 , M0 ] per American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] 7th ed . ) select iKnowMed ( iKM ) electronic health record database complete adjuvant FOLFOX . This feasibility study find start dose regorafenib estimate least 75 % patient able tolerate full dose regorafenib receive adjuvant FOLFOX . Patients randomly assign regorafenib SOC ( treatment ) . In order test best tolerate start dose , first 50 patient receive regorafenib randomize 1:1 either 120 mg mouth ( PO ) 160 mg PO . If 120 mg dose well tolerated toxicity severe ( Grade 2 less ) upon completion cycle 2 , dose increase 160 mg start Cycle 3 . Registration randomization patient resume 26th 50th patient complete 3 cycle study treatment . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) meet 26th patient complete 3 cycle treatment second meeting take place 50th patient complete 3 cycle . If need , third DSMB meeting schedule . The remain 214 patient randomize 2:3 decide start dose versus SOC . In addition , evaluate Texture ( spatial variation pixel intensity ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan might help predict risk recurrence . Therefore , CT disk send Imaging Endpoints Core Lab , Scottsdale , AZ , TexRAD platform ( software algorithm ) use analysis .</detailed_description>
