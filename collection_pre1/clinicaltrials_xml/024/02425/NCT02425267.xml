	<brief_title>Effectiveness Home Telerehabilitation Program People With Proximal Humerus Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year , one three elderly people make least one fall , 10 % cause fracture . Of fracture , proximal humerus , forearm wrist count approximately one third total osteoporotic fracture elderly people . Proximal humerus fracture treat surgically ( eg : pinning , plate screw , etc.. ) conventionally wear splint cast . Whether either approach , individual require rehabilitation prevent function limitation . Among possible reason low use rehabilitation service , 1 ) poor availability rehabilitation service fracture humerus ; 2 ) difficulty elderly travel receive service precarious status . Telerehabilitation promise alternative approach help improve access rehabilitation service patient discharge hospital . Some study demonstrate physiotherapy significant factor process heal functional recovery proximal humerus fracture , , conservative surgical treatment . This show good recovery patient satisfaction physiotherapy . In addition , since majority patient proximal humerus fracture elderly , become relevant find new way offer quick service physiotherapy simple suitable condition . The main objective study compare clinical effect innovative telerehabilitation approach ( TELE group ) compare face-to-face visit clinic ( CLINIC group ) patient treat proximal humerus fracture . The research hypothesis : 1 . TELE intervention effective CLINIC intervention improve upper extremity function . 2 . TELE intervention effective CLINIC intervention improve deficiency shoulder ( increase range motion ) . 3 . Participants receive TELE intervention satisfy care participant receive CLINICL intervention . 4 . TELE intervention less costly compare CLINIC intervention . Methodology : The study randomize control trial design . The study population interest individual proximal humerus fracture receive conservative treatment Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke ( CHUS ) return home . Participants recruit visit emergency outpatient clinic medical team research nurse assistant . The investigator expect recruit 52 participant , say 26 per group . All evaluation complete research center/hospital approximately 1.5 hour duration . The first evaluation conduct medical team ask rehabilitation ( T1 ) allow participant base measure collect . The evaluation conduct immediately 2-month intervention ( T2 ) . The independent variable conventional physiotherapy experimental intervention telerehabilitation . The dependant variable 1 ) upper extremity function ; 2 ) range motion ; 3 ) user satisfaction ; 4 ) cost service accord healthcare system . Platform use : In study , platform base technological infrastructure develop test previous telerehabilitation study use . The infrastructure combine clinical information system videoconference component ( Tandberg 550 MXP , H 264 ) use camera control clinician use computer software . The difference two group compare use t-test chi-square test . The economic analysis type cost-effectiveness . The cost per unit change main dependent variable ( Constant Score ) determine two group ( TELE CONTROL ) cost differential establish .</detailed_description>
