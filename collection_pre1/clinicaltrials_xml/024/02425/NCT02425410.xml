	<brief_title>Analysis Viral Infections ' Exposition Preceding Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) Diagnostic Children Isis-Diab Cohort . Search Explanations Disease 's Early Onset</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The `` hygiene hypothesis '' , propose explain observed increase incidence T1D , rely experimental evidence acquire mouse model . However , epidemiological data still lack validate hypothesis man . This critical , -in opposition hygiene hypothesis- many reason believe , contrary , certain virus trigger disease . Genetic predisposition severe infection form ( particularly primary infection ) demonstrate several infectious disease ( Casanova JL , Science 317:617-619 , 2007 ; Casanova JL , EMBO J 26:915-922 , 2007 ) . It usually correspond deficiency gene involve host 's immune response , transmission Mendelian . Genetic factor affect ability enteroviruses virus damage beta cell induce diabetes . Recently , Nejentsev et al demonstrated link enteroviruses diabetes gene : indeed identify 4 rare IFIH1 polymorphism reduce T1D risk . However , gene encodes enzyme recognize DNA enterovirus , cause immunity activation ; mutation inhibit gene activation . Except one study HIV-1 , knowledge genome wide association study ( GWAS ) humans role host 's genetic polymorphism risk infection , clinical expression , duration viral shedding , response therapy anti-viral vaccine . We rely cohort T1D child ( Isis-Diab ) investigate possible relation viral exposure , genetic polymorphism , subsequent T1D . The search viral factor responsible increase T1D prevalence youth child difficult implement . The absence scarcity infection difficult assess robustly individual level . The analysis digestive , ENT blood sample search viruses do T1D diagnosis therefore unlikely positive several year causal infection . It possible reconstitute retrospectively viral event , individual expose birth date diabetes diagnosis . That project propose use proxy viral infection cross child , quantify viral exposure submit T1D diagnosis . We focus early childhood 's viral infection may interfere early form T1D . We combine 2 data source : - The geolocation child 's address locate place live . Spatio-temporal data Sentinel Network , collect since 1984 , provide access follow viral exposure : seasonal influenza , viral diarrhea ( mostly enteroviral ) , mumps , measles , chickenpox . If defect approach see real viral infection experience child , level exposure expose accord address , advantage objective spatio-temporal description virus epidemic around child , make less likely infection . Only France Sentinel data . - Vaccination ( include MMR ) information infectious past child collect data record book health . We focus mother 's pregnancy child birth 2 year age . Environmental data 2 source cross already available genetic data GWAS identify gene-virus association potentially determine age T1D onset . This `` high dimensionality '' analysis address `` machine learning '' program . If avoidable risk identify , would possible think design clinical trial prevention identify form T1D .</detailed_description>
