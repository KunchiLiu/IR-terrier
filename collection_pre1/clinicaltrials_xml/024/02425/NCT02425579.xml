	<brief_title>Safety Study Inhaled Carbon Monoxide Treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) syndrome severe acute lung inflammation hypoxemic respiratory failure incidence 180,000 case annually U.S.Despite decade research recent advance lung protective ventilator strategy , morbidity mortality remain unacceptably high . Furthermore , specific effective pharmacologic therapy currently exist . The lack specific effective therapy sepsis-related ARDS indicate need new treatment target novel pathway . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) represent novel therapeutic modality ARDS base data obtain experimental model ARDS sepsis past decade . CO show protective experimental model Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) , include hyperoxia endotoxin exposure , bleomycin , ischemia/reperfusion , ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . At low dos , CO show confer tissue protective effect ALI model . In addition , CO show decrease inflammation , enhance phagocytosis , improve mortality model sepsis include endotoxemia , hemorrhagic shock , cecal ligation puncture ( CLP ) . CO also show beneficial therapeutic effect pre-clinical model disease include pulmonary hypertension , vascular injury , transplantation . Furthermore , multiple human study demonstrate experimental administration several different concentration CO well tolerate low dose inhale CO safely administer subject control research environment . The purpose study assess safety inhale CO therapy mechanically ventilated patient sepsis-induced ARDS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients sepsis define suspect documented infection : Suspected proven infection : Sites infection include thorax , urinary tract , abdomen , skin , sinus , central venous catheter , central nervous system 2 . ARDS define four follow criterion meet : A PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 least 5 cm H2O positive endexpiratory airway pressure ( PEEP ) Bilateral infiltrate consistent pulmonary edema frontal chest radiograph A need positive pressure ventilation endotracheal tracheal tube No clinical evidence leave atrial hypertension bilateral pulmonary infiltrates . 3 . ARDS onset define time last criterion 14 met . ARDS must persist enrollment time window 120 hour . 4 . Infiltrates consider `` consistent pulmonary edema '' include infiltrates fully explain mass , atelectasis , effusion opacity know chronic ( great 1 week ) . Vascular redistribution , indistinct vessel , indistinct heart border alone consider `` consistent pulmonary edema '' thus would count qualify opacity study . 1 . Age le 18 year 2 . Greater 120 hour since ARDS onset 3 . Pregnant breastfeed 4 . Prisoner 5 . Patient , surrogate , physician commit full support ( exception : patient exclude he/she would receive supportive care except attempt resuscitation cardiac arrest ) 6 . No consent/inability obtain consent 7 . Physician refusal allow enrollment trial 8 . Moribund patient expect survive 24 hour 9 . No arterial line/no intent place arterial line 10 . No intent/unwillingness follow lung protective ventilation strategy 11 . Severe hypoxemia define SpO2 &lt; 95 PaO2 &lt; 80 FiO2 ≥0.8 12 . Hemoglobin &lt; 7.5 g/dl upon admission ICU hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl actively bleed upon admission ICU 13 . Subjects Jehovah 's Witnesses otherwise unable unwilling receive blood transfusion hospitalization 14 . Acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) within last 90 day 15 . Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery within 30 day 16 . Angina pectoris use nitrate activity daily live 17 . Cardiopulmonary disease classify NYHA class IV 18 . Stroke ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) within prior 3 month 19 . Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage vasculitis 20 . Use high frequency ventilation 21 . Participation interventional study 22 . Burns &gt; 40 % total body surface area 23 . Use inhaled vasodilator therapy ( eg . NO prostaglandin )</criteria>
