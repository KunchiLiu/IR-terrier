	<brief_summary>Growing recognition importance co-morbidities Heart Failure Preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFPEF ) lead realization rather distinct disease entity , HFPEF may represent spectrum co-morbidities elderly breathless patient . Accordingly , progress manage HFPEF elderly require improved understanding HFPEF pathogenesis focus impact co-morbidities . However , available evidence insufficient determine true prevalence severity co-morbidities well impact diagnosis treatment HFPEF . Therefore widespread diagnostic uncertainty without proven therapy ! The purpose project twofold : 1 . The investigator study improve diagnostic accuracy HFPEF elderly patient , despite frequent comorbidities higher age ? How useful add exercise test contrast echocardiography well biomarker additional diagnostic tool elderly HFPEF patient ? 2 . The investigator test hypothesis HFPEF elderly dominate multiple co-morbidities major part syndrome contribute development HFPEF . This hypothesis imply treatment co-morbidities improve prognosis . The investigator ' overall goal bring paradigm shift manage elderly patient HFPEF improve diagnosis also effectively treat co-morbidities currently consider predispose factor HFPEF . This contrast trial last two decade target heart . The investigator pursue follow specific aim : 1 . Validate diagnostic criterion HFPEF propose European Society Cardiology 2012 , determine add diagnostic value exercise test contrast echocardiography well biomarker HFPEF multi-center study . 2 . Determine systematic screen optimal management co-morbidities associate HFPEF improve outcome patient HFPEF randomize study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Management Comorbidity Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction Elderly ( &gt; 60 Years )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure primarily disease elderly , approximately half case occur patient age â‰¥75 year . Heart failure lead cause hospitalization elderly . Moreover , worsen cognition , physical function quality life , increase health care cost lead high mortality . Nearly half patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFPEF ) , prevalence appear rise . Although patterns morbidity functional decline similar patient HFPEF heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFREF ) , HFPEF represent particular challenge since proven treatment . Therapies effective HFREF , include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker beta blocker , far unsuccessful HFPEF . This differential response therapy combine distinct pattern structural remodel suggest HFPEF HFREF two discrete entity fundamentally different pathophysiologies . A recently propose mechanism HFPEF development identifies systemic pro-inflammatory state induce comorbidities primary cause HFPEF . Therefore , progress manage HFPEF require improve understanding HFPEF pathogenesis focus impact comorbidities . Hypothesis : HFPEF elderly dominate multiple comorbidity complicate factor HFPEF , major part syndrome , contribute HFPEF . Therefore , make comorbidity attractive therapeutic target promote paradigm shift toward individualized optimal care elderly patient HFPEF . Main purpose : To promote paradigm shift toward individualized optimal care elderly patient HFPEF effective treatment comorbidities . Specific aim : To determine systematic screen optimal management comorbidities associate HFPEF improve outcome patient HFPEF Work plan : The investigator ' intervention study use multi-centre , prospective , randomize , open procedure blind end-point ( PROBE ) design . Patients ( n=360 ) randomize 1:1 either usual care ( n=180 ) intervention ( n=180 ) . Inclusion criterion HFPEF &gt; 60 year . In Intervention arm , patient subject systematic screening optimal treatment 12 frequently see co-morbidity . Endpoints collect Independent Endpoint Committee year 2 year . Significance clinical relevance : The present study focus important issue investigator ' society , namely HFPEF elderly population . This health problem largely ignore despite fact recommend therapy . The investigator ' propose study represent paradigm shift therapy . It base new concept focus comorbidities consider predispose factor HFPEF contrast available trial target heart . The investigator ' study therefore challenge current clinical practice may fill knowledge gap HFPEF .</detailed_description>
