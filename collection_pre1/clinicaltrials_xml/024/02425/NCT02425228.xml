	<detailed_description>Each biopsy session would precede mpMRI , would delineate assigned degree suspicion radiologist ( see ) .The PI-RADS score system use assign degree suspicion region interest within prostate . A second reader independently score RSI Likert scale , blind MRI data . The region interest delineate use software develop Eigen collaboration study co-author ( D.M . ) , commercially available use UCLA team past 2 year ( ProFuse , Eigen ) .The RSI data integrate standard mpMRI data change score presence additional lesion , determine RSI , quantify . For men MR-visible target PI-RADS score 3 , irrespective RSI score , biopsy session would proceed ordered routine , follow : 1 . Conventional ultrasound-guided 12-core systematic biopsy would perform first . This portion perform without operator knowledge MRI report , i.e. , urologist blind possible tumor location use method standard practice throughout U.S. many year . 2 . Next targeted biopsy would perform use visual guidance ( cognitive fusion ) , supervision radiologist specialize prostate MRI . The radiologist biopsy suite help urologist direct needle location region interest prostate see MRI . Three direct biopsy core obtain . 3 . Third , target biopsy use Artemis device fusion MRI ultrasound image would perform . The prostate scan MRI region interest ( target ) bring 3D model via device fusion . Targeted biopsy perform take three core tissue target area , visualize 3D region fusion device . Biopsy sit dictate geometric guide ( 12 point pattern v visual direction radiologist v fusion target ) , choose arbitrarily . The biopsy schema require procedure time sample take fusion biopsy perform IRB approval institution last five year . Additional core require visual biopsy method , biopsy core obtain secondary target . Most patient exhibit secondary target . An analysis data past 2 year demonstrate chance secondary target show significant cancer , present primary target , less 1 % . Therefore , secondary target sample , core instead take primary target use two method . In 200 men undergo initial biopsy , average 17 +/- 3 S.D . cores/patient obtain . In present proposal , 18 core take . Thus , number cores/patient trial substantially exceed number routinely take practice past . A sample method three direct core per target choose compromise clinically feasible statistical ideal take additional core significant cancer detection lower grade target . The cognitive biopsy require approximately 90 second additional time , add time compensate reduced time obtain exclude secondary target . The overall biopsy schema require ( probably less ) 15-20 minutes/procedure past . Biopsies perform experienced team , work together since 2009 .</detailed_description>
