	<brief_summary>The CYP2B6 enzyme metabolize grow number clinically important drug anti-HIV drug efavirenz , activity liver highly variable , may lead failure therapy toxicity unpredictable drug interaction . Genetic several nongenetic factor affect activity CYP2B6 . The goal study determine impact simultaneous autoinhibition/autoinduction CYP2B6 genetics CYP2B6 activity , efavirenz exposure efavirenz-mediated drug interaction . The pharmacokinetics drug interaction determine three occasion total 60 healthy volunteer . The whole study 4 phase . A ) Phase 1 ( baseline control ) : use selective probe substrate , baseline activity CYP2B6 ( bupropion ) , CYP2C8 ( montelukast ) OATP1B1 ( rosuvastatin ) determine . B ) Phase 2 ( inhibition ) : metabolism pharmacokinetics single 600 mg oral dose efavirenz ) activity CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 OATP1B1 ( inhibition ) determine . C ) Phase 3 ( treatment phase ) : After complete phase 2 , subject take 600 mg/day efavirenz home 17 day . C ) Phase 4 ( induction inhibition ) : At end phase 3 , steady state metabolism pharmacokinetics efavirenz activity CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 OATP1B1 determine . Efavirenz serve model substrate , inhibitor inducer CYP2B6 ( drug disposition protein ) .

	<detailed_description>Schedule assessment PHASE 1 ( CONTROL PHASE ) Phase 1 ( day 1 day 4 ) : baseline ( control ) activity CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 OATP1B1 measure use selective probe substrate . Eligible subject receive simultaneously single 100 mg dose bupropion ( CYP2B6 ) , single 10 mg dose montelukast ( CYP2C8 ) single 5 mg dose rosuvastatin ( OATP1B1 ) mouth empty stomach together least 10 day phase 2 . Frequent plasma sample collect 72 hour urine 48 hour dose . Safety assessment make first 24 hour . Phase 1 complete last blood draw day 4 ( 72 hour ) . PHASE 2 ( INHIBITION PHASE ) In phase 2 ( day 11 16 ) , metabolism pharmacokinetics single 600 mg oral dose efavirenz determine along activity CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 OATP1B1 . Subjects receive single 600 mg oral dose efavirenz blood sample obtain 30 min 1 hour . Immediately 1 hour blood draw , three probe drug ( 10 mg montelukast , 100 mg bupropion , 5 mg rosuvastatin ) administer simultaneously . Frequent plasma sample collect 120 hour urine 48 hour efavirenz dose . Safety assessment make first 24 hour . Phase 2 complete last blood draw day 16 ( 120 hour ) . Note : The additional time point ( compare phase 1 ) need long elimination half-life efavirenz . PHASE 3 ( EFAVIRENZ TREATMENT PHASE ) . In phase 3 ( day 16 32 ) , subject take efavirenz ( 600 mg/day ) every even 17 day ( Note : Phase 3 start subject take first dose even Day 16 ) . Prior take even dose , request return Indiana Clinical Research Center day 19 , day 22 , day 25 , day 28 day 31 brief outpatient visit vital sign check , draw blood sample ( ~10 ml , approximately 2 teaspoonful ) , fill brief central nervous system ( CNS ) symptom questionnaire . They remind take even dose efavirenz day blood draw . Since efavirenz long half-life ( ~76 hour single dose ~50 steady state ) , total 17 day efavirenz treatment required achieve steady-state plasma concentration efavirenz steady-state autoinduction metabolism . Subjects instruct take efavirenz bed-time minimize efavirenz-induced central nervous side effect . Minor rescheduling ( ±3 day ) subject 's fixed inpatient/outpatient visit allow include adjust amount study medication ( 3 dos less 3 dos ) give prior subject 's 4th inpatient visit . PHASE 4 ( INHIBITION/INDUCTION PHASE ) In phase 4 ( day 33 38 ) , steady-state metabolism pharmacokinetics efavirenz determine along activity CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 OATP1B1 . The procedure describe phase 2 repeat . On day 38 , exit exam perform consist repeat repeat screen laboratory test include blood urine test . The study diary collect . Medication bottle leave pill ( ) return pill remain count compliance purpose . The total duration study 38 day .</detailed_description>
