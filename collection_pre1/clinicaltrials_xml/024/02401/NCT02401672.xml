	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking remain significant public health concern . A magnetic field apply outside skull produce electrical activity brain without significant pain need anesthesia . Sessions magnetic stimulation superficial stimulation reach brain use determine magnetic stimulation reduce cue-induced craving cigarette consumption adult nicotine-dependent cigarette smoker . This project may lead new therapy smoking cessation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking cause significant morbidity mortality United States . Smoking cessation difficult , average smoker attempt quit five time permanent success . Moreover , majority smoking quit attempt result relapse . Brain stimulation smoke cessation excite new area build advance neuroscience knowledge concern functional neurocircuitry addiction . Cortical stimulation perform non-invasively transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . A study show TMS reduce cue-elicited craving smoker . Previous research group show single session 15 minute high frequency ( 10 Hz ) repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) 100 % motor threshold leave dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ( area likely involved inhibit crave ) reduce cue-induced craving compare sham TMS . However , methodological concern surround preliminary finding limit definitive conclusion effectiveness TMS long period time . This R21 proposal integrate rigorous experimental condition , true double-blind methodology , MRI guide stimulation site longer-term follow-up assessment . Using rigorous double-masked method MRI guide stimulation site , propose use active rTMS sham rTMS , determine whether 10 session two week period consist 15 minute high frequency rTMS reduce cue-induced craving cigarette consumption cigarette smoker . The project also optimize rational rTMS parameter make TMS efficacious treatment nicotine dependence . In two year project , plan recruit 42 treatment-seeking nicotine-dependent cigarette smoker , male female ethnic racial group age 18 60 participate study . The 42 participant randomly assign receive active prefrontal TMS sham prefrontal TMS . The data R21 provide information need launch definitive larger-scale investigation potential clinical application TMS smoke cessation . The result pilot also likely supply substantial information utility cortical stimulation smoke cessation .</detailed_description>
