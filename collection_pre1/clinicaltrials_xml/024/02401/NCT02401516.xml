	<brief_summary>ASH high prevalence rate consider one major modifiable risk factor cardiac vascular disease ( CVD ) brain vascular disease ( BVD ) one important public health problem . Researches estimate 62 % BVD attribute ASH . In Brazil , prevalence hypertension range 21.6 % 2006 42.4 % 2011 . CVD responsible high frequency hospitalization , 2009 , 91,970 hospitalization due CVD cost public treasury 165 million reais . ASH neurological pathophysiology study show excessive activation sympathetic autonomic nervous system ( SANS ) seem important role genesis maintenance ASH , current study aim understand relationship . Pathways use SANS immediate control BP ( wich reticulate formation , bulb cortex ) appear similar pathway use postural control reflex ( reticulate formation , bulb , cortex , among others ) , also use Postural Reprogramming Insoles ( PRI ) posture adequacy . Due similarity reflex activation area , believe PRI may effect BP regulation . There many way treat postural change one posturology , base therapeutic use postural reprogramming insole ( PRI ) . PRI activate tonic-postural system , rebalancing muscle , joint bony structure body segment , return individual appropriate posture . The PRI compose central artifact , situate reflex zone full somatosensory stimuli captor , generates frequency vibration promote postural adaptation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posture define way body acquire give time relation gravity line , suffers influence sensory information different segment , organ system , integrated cerebral cortex . Once information associate , analyze compare , send tonic phasic-tonic muscle perform necessary adjustment maintain posture . When sensory information capture body unbalanced , body reacts information deformity misalignment like flat foot , scoliosis , among others . Posturology way treat alignment change , base use postural reprogramming insole ( PRI ) return individual appropriate posture . The PRI compose central artifact stimulates autonomic system , via tonic postural system , promote posture adaptation/regulation . What known , though , influence insole system cardiovascular system condition , arterial systemic hypertension ( ASH ) , multifactorial clinical condition characterize high constant level blood pressure ( BP ) . ASH neurological pathophysiology study show excessive activation sympathetic autonomic nervous system ( SANS ) seem important role genesis maintenance ASH , current study aim understand relationship . Previous study indicate , despite effort understand control arterial systemic hypertension , rate ASH control low difficulty list : access health service medication , adherence guideline , quantity medication usage , non-controlling hypertension even medication , family help regard treatment , difficulty maintain regular practice physical exercise . Therefore , necessary encourage dietary control , increase patient support new form affordable effective non-pharmacological treatment , addition measure impact disease cause life live patient . Arterial Systemic Hypertension impact physical health , psychological well-being , longevity quality life ( QOL ) , therefore quality life important criterion studying , use indicator impact illness provoke individual well provide data individual adaptation . Quality life ( QOL ) define WHO `` individual 's perception position life context culture value system live relation goal , expectation , standard concern '' . Health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) evaluate base objective measurable data , apply sick people identify committed dimension discomfort degree associate limitation disease and/or therapy cause . Thus , health professional effectively measure impact intervention health-related quality life . Instruments assess HRQOL usually questionnaires must go validation process language-country , case Portuguese . From HRQOL questionnaire validate Brazil , one specific ass quality life hypertension individual , call Mini-Questionnaire Quality Life Hypertension - MINICHAL , develop Spain 2001 , validate Brazil 2007 . THEORETICAL RATIONALE Imbalances affect posture reflection asymmetry Tonic Postural System ( TPS ) . The simplified model organization STP state equilibrium depend fascia muscle viscoelastic system maintain balance body mass action , gravity , height . In stand position , fascia able overcome force oppose gravity , lonely , require joint muscle action balance force body . Posture classify appropriate inappropriate . When sensory information capture body symmetrical well organize , tonic-postural system reaction generate minimal overload bone , joint myofascial structure , produce low energy expenditure maintenance structure , favor relative alignment gravity individual appropriated posture . If sensory information , capture body unbalanced , inconsistent disorganize , tonic-postural system require muscle , joint , fascia bone structure , keep body segment react gravity force . It create disharmonious relationship various part body , produce great burden support structure less efficient body balance stand weight basis , create great energy expenditure , misalignment deformity like flat foot , knee valgus , scoliosis , among others person poor posture . During motion , predict movement movement actually do . Between two point cerebellum , structure compare predict performed movement promote postural adjustment , carry movement close expect . Cerebellum organize , provide , adjust modifies movement . Adaptation system function get body back balance case imbalance , internal external . Terminal system adaptation foot therefore reprogramming TPS without focus foot , use postural reprogramming insole ( PRI ) . PRI artifact form two cross polarize device , create electrogalvanic field load unloads , cause vibration integrates energy field individual . This integration lead permanent posture recalibration , align individual relation gravity force consequent improvement postural change secondary imbalance . These sensory stimulus use SANS stimulate area brain cerebellum , vestibular nucleus , basal nucleus ( BN ) , reticulate formation bulb frontal premotor cortex cause posture correction . BP control also related SANS , use nerve reflex stimulating baroreceptor , locate artery wall distend , happen high BP , send signal glossopharyngeal nerve reticular formation medulla , brain stem , cause inhibition vasoconstrictor center excite vagal center , consequent : vasodilation vein arteriole , decreased heart rate ( HR ) heart contraction force , lead fall reflex BP due decrease peripheral resistance cardiac debit , respectively . However , seem occur show recent study existence constant activation / stimulation vasoconstrictor center hypertensive individual , cause BP remain high level . Stimulation vasoconstrictor center suffers influence SANS , use area reticulate formation , bulb cerebral cortex , area appear similar used reflex control posture ( reticulate formation , bulb , cortex , among others ) , also use PRI posture correction . Due similarity area reflex activation , believe PRI may effect BP regulation . Once occur regulation blood pressure due use PRI improved posture , expect positive effect health-related quality life hypertensive patient . Mini-Questionnaire Quality Life Hypertension - MINICHAL-Brazil suffered cultural adaptation validation Portuguese , test content , construct internal consistency instrument , compare outcome hypertensive patient patient normal BP . Subsequently , study publish test concurrent validity compare Minichal two questionnaire use many research Brazil : Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) WHOQOL questionnaire ( WHOQOL-Bref ) , show significant correlation questionnaire , make specific tool assess health-related quality life hypertensive population . Whereas many study develop later stage hypertension impairment functional capacity , respiratory locomotor observe stage ; Whereas chronic systemic condition progressive evolution ; Whereas study address hypertensive population stage I II without target organ injury ; important identify early stage condition ( stage I II ) possible observe change mention system , identify effect hypertension functional capacity , respiratory locomotor system , character prevention , also early diagnosis prognosis .</detailed_description>
