	<brief_summary>The 12-lead ECG essential tool cardiovascular assessment . Novel technology potential improve diagnostic yield arrhythmia , whilst improve patient experience . The RhythmPadGP novel device acquire 6-lead ECG without need patient undress . The aim study assess ability device diagnose cardiac rhythm . Simultaneous record RhythmPadGP 6-lead ECG undertaken time standard 12-lead ECG . The 12-lead ECGs 6-lead ECGs analyse Cardiologist , blind set ECGs automate diagnostic report produce RhythmPadGP device . Such novel diagnostic tool could replace standard 12-lead ECG rapid assessment diagnosis arrhythmia . Additionally , call national screen programme detect atrial fibrillation ( prevent AF-related thromboembolism ) currently intensify , RhythmPad potential revolutionise screen patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The concept Rhythm Pad screen public non-invasively cardiac rhythm abnormality , every time interact clinician . Cardiocity conduct significant trialing RhythmPad product within primary care set Old Cottage Hospital Epsom secondary care set St Peter 's Hospital Chertsey . The initial result encourage simple hand screen provide indication AF 66 % confirmed case AF , verify traditional electrocardiogram ( ECG ) know GE MAC550 12 lead device benchmark . The main aim RhythmPad range product increase ability diagnose cardiac rhythm abnormality , along reduce number false positive referral secondary care 12 lead Electrocardiogram ECG . As confirm diagnosis referral reduces number false positive referral . If one algorithm think evidence person might state Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) , Flutter , might leave right bundle branch block , etc , move 6 lead able increase confidence diagnosis . The RhythmPad able support 6 lead ECG acquisition , use modify device call RhythmPadGP would plan trial technology St Peter 's Hospital . We learn experience previous trail . We know 5 % entire population strong enough Lead 1 ECG measure hand . Also Essential Tremor , Parkinson 's etc . able keep hand steady accurate reading take . In case , escalation one lead data , offer simple Velcro ankle strap attachment ability record 6 lead data .</detailed_description>
