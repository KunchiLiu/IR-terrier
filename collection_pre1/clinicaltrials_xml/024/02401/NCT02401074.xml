	<brief_title>Airway Temperature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total eight participant enrol study . We take direct measurement bronchial mucosa temperature . This test accurately asthma participant anesthesia know low body temperature . The propose study use experimental procedure call segmental bronchoprovocation challenge allergen asthmatic patient offer unique approach test hypothesis . Individuals enrol study participate eight week take part four visit estimate last 2 8 hour . Participants also participant one follow-up phone call follow Test day 2 . Patients asthma healthy participant recruit participate study advertisement posting Kentucky Clinic and/or University Kentucky Hospital well main campus . The study also add website use post . Patients asthma prescribed diagnostic therapeutic bronchoscopy procedure UK Pulmonary Clinic identify recruit qualified physician clinic . The medical history record patient make available include data form complete spirometry test clinical test , physical examination , smoke history , symptom , current medication use , drug allergy , laboratory image data . After eligible patient identify meet proper inclusion criterion , inform consent obtain . Participants receive explanation research project include potential risk . In addition , participant show actual size temperature probe use procedure . The participation individual study way affect current treatment . No bias hold individual clinical staff elect participate study . Informed consent obtain potential participant fully inform via verbal/written information procedure nature research , risk involve , right research subject . The experimental procedure carry University Kentucky A.B . Chandler Hospital . Direct measurement airway mucosal temperature perform ten minute SBP-Ag challenge . This miniature probe position airway lumen use Olympus fiberoptic bronchoscope ( model MP160F ) , connect via cable battery-operated thermometer ( model FLL ) manufacture also Physitemp Instrument Inc . The probe ( outside diameter 0.4 mm ) pass instrument channel ( inner diameter : 2.0 mm ) bronchoscope . By maneuver control knob bronchoscope , blunt tip probe gently press airway mucosa 5-6 different position segmental sub-segmental bronchus , five ten second . The entire protocol temperature measurement require 5 minute complete . The contact temperature probe airway mucosa cause tissue damage , relatively non-invasive compare procedure involve routine bronchoscopy biopsy , cytology brushing , etc Physical Examination : It include assessment subject 's general condition , head neck , chest respiratory auscultation , cardiac auscultation , limited abdominal , extremity neurological exam . Vital sign : Heart rate , blood pressure , body temperature arterial oxygen saturation . Screening Visits 1 2 : Following procedure occur screen visit obtain write informed consent . - Collection demographic information ( Demographic data collect screen visit include name , initial , address , social security number , cod study number , medical record number , height , weight , age , race , ethnicity , gender , telephone number email address . ) - Collection medical medication history - Urine pregnancy test - Vital sign - Skin prick test - Spirometry - Limited physical examination - Study eligibility review - Whole lung allergen inhalation challenge - Adverse Event assessment - Concomitant medication Visit 3 ( Test Day 1 ) - Review eligibility criterion - Vital sign - Spirometry - Urine pregnancy test - Physical examination - Bronchoscopy lavage - Segmental allergen challenge - Adverse Event assessment - Concomitant medication Visit 4 ( Test Day 2 ) - Review eligibility criterion - Vital sign - Spirometry - Physical examination - Bronchoscopy lavage - Adverse Event assessment - Concomitant medication Follow-up Phone Call . A follow-up phone call take place 1 day follow last study visit . During phone call participant ask question regard adverse event may experience since last visit along use concomitant medication .</detailed_description>
