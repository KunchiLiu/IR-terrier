	<detailed_description>Patients refer evaluation wrist pain CT arthrography eligible inclusion . Patients benefit dynamic CT acquisition arthrography three maneuver : radio-ulnar deviation , clench fist dart throw motion . Patients also benefit wrist MR study 3 tesla scanner . The morphology carpal ligament evaluate static imaging ( MR CT arthrograph ) dynamic CT arthrography . Distance angular measurement obtain dynamic CT study use appropriate post processing tool ( 4D-Ortho ) . Data obtain dynamic wrist evaluation correlate ligament morphology , classical wrist instability criteria conventional radiograph surgery ( available ) .</detailed_description>
