	<brief_title>PREA , PK And Safety PASS Study Of IV Pantoprazole In Pediatric Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In hospitalize pediatric subject , age 1 16 year judgment investigator candidate acid suppression therapy , follow objective trial : Primary Objectives To characterize PK profile single repeat IV dos pantoprazole pediatric subject age 1 &lt; less 2 year old . To characterize PK profile single repeat IV dos pantoprazole pediatric subject age 2 16 year old . Secondary Objectives To determine safety tolerability single multiple dos IV pantoprazole independent age cohorts 7 day . To assess CYP2C19 genotype pediatric subject receive IV pantoprazole , determine presence gene major enzyme responsible metabolism pantoprazole .</detailed_description>
