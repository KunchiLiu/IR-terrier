	<brief_title>Factors Associated With Maintenance Antibody Responses Influenza Vaccine Older , Community-Dwelling Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , yearly influenza vaccination begin August September . However , influenza season extend April follow year . The duration protection annual vaccination old adult unknown , little known factor associate maintenance response throughout influenza season . This study evaluate factor associate immune response older adult trivalent influenza vaccine maintenance antibody responses duration influenza season . Subjects Subjects enrol two site , Vanderbilt University Medical Center ( Nashville , TN ) Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation ( Marshfield , WI ) , September October 2009 . Subjects eligible recruitment ≥50 year age contraindication influenza vaccination . Subject recruitment include advertisement Vanderbilt University Medical Center letter invitation old adult receive influenza vaccine year prior Marshfield Clinic.1 All subject vaccinate either usual caregiver study staff . Strain component 2009-2010 Northern Hemisphere vaccine include A/Brisbane/59/2007-like ( H1N1 ) , A/Brisbane/10/2007-like ( H3N2 ) , B/Brisbane/60/2008-like . Participants give trivalent seasonal vaccine 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine available . Data Collection All subject donate serum pre-vaccination ( S1 ) September October 2009 , 21 - 28 day post-vaccination ( S2 ) post-influenza season , May July , 2010 , approximately 250 day ( 8 month ) post-vaccination ( S3 ) . Study procedure , inform consent document data collection form review approved Institutional Review Boards study site . Age , co-morbid condition , sex , race ascertain participant interview . Recent chemotherapy , radiation therapy , use immunomodulating medication ascertain self-report chart review . CDC-defined high risk medical condition identify self-report organ transplantation , cancer , diabetes mellitus , splenectomy ( functional anatomic ) , cardiovascular disease , renal disease , sickle cell disease , chronic pulmonary disease , seizure disorder , immune deficiency , dementia.2 Self-reported stress determine ask participant respond yes question `` Have suffer psychological stress acute disease past 3 month ? '' include part Mini Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire.3 Height weight measure research study staff body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight ( kg ) / height ( ) 2 . Laboratory Methods Blood sample process , store , ship institution 's local Sample Processing Core Battelle ( Columbus , OH ) . Hemagglutinin inhibition ( HAI ) test perform duplicate influenza vaccine strain 2009-2010 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine . Although debate best correlate protection influenza,4 seroprotection define HAI titer ≥40 since correlate recognize United States Food Drug Administration.5 Seroconversion measure S2 define four-fold rise HAI post-influenza vaccination compare pre-vaccination ≥40 S1 &lt; 10 . Maintenance antibody response measure participant S2 ≥40 , define S3≥40 . If duplicate HAI result discrepant two fold , third test perform minimum result record . Statistical Analysis Multivariable logistic regression model run binary outcome seroprotection S2 S3 seroconversion S2 . Age , BMI , stress , high risk medical condition ( yes/no ) , female gender , study site transform S1 titer include model . Time day S1 S3 include model S3 relate outcomes continuous variable . Restricted cubic spline apply age BMI . All raw HAI titer log transform use method outline Beyer,6 change dilution titer integer HAI &lt; 10 cod 0 , 10 1 , 20 2 , 40 3 . Interaction term age high risk status , stress age sex test include base non-significant p value overall interaction term . Figures generate predict probability HAI titer ≥40 logistic regression . All analyse do use R version 2.12.2 .</detailed_description>
