	<brief_summary>The Karasek Job Content Questionnaire include 2 dimension : psychological demand work , latitude decision . The combination two characteristic explains degree exposure worker stress . Indeed , worker pressure ( job-strain ) workload important autonomy poor . The Sumer study conduct France 25,000 employee classify occupation take account psychological demand latitude decision occupation . No publication emergency physician ' response Karasek questionnaire reference , even though exposure burnout know . A preliminary study 19 emergency physician CHU Clermont-Ferrand illustrate concretely `` extraordinary situation '' , low decision latitude high psychological demand ever record . Moreover , data result Karasek questionnaire different condition within participant , i.e . response Karasek questionnaire suppose similar reflect constant perception work . Additionally , several biomarkers stress propose , particular DHEAS due long half-life 16 hour . To knowledge , relationship biomarkers stress tension work Karasek model never study , like relation wellness questionnaire . Comparisons emergency health care worker also lack . Our study propose evaluate perception emergency medicine Karasek questionnaire , ass possible change perception biological response two condition : night shift control day ( workday ) , emergency health care worker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SEEK Study - Study Emergency Health Care Workers ' Job Strain Evaluated Karasek Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic stress work public health problem increase morbidity mortality . Emergency physicians particularly risk population . Indeed , work complex interaction stress due life-threatening emergency , lack sleep accumulate fatigue . A way measure stress work use self-reported psychological questionnaire . Among , Job control demand model Karasek widely use evaluate psychosocial factor work . The Karasek job strain model assess 25 000 worker Sumer study allow classify main type occupation . However , data regard emergency physician score Karasek questionnaire available , even though burnout exposure well-known problematic among health care worker . This absence particularly unfortunate emergency physician often need deal life threaten emergency short amount time , follow regularly long crave shift . A preliminary study low sample size report concrete term atypical `` limit '' situation emergency physician , decision latitude among low high psychological demand ever report . Moreover , variation stress work link professional experience . Karasek questionnaire suppose assess long-term stable perception work , despite absence study compare Karasek score within different condition participant . It also important explore protective factor might help alleviate perceived stress quite easy integrate medical organization daily lifestyle . Finally , several biomarkers stress propose . Among , team previously highlight potential DHEAS ass stress , due stability ( steroid ) long half-life 16 hour . To knowledge , relationship biomarkers stress Karasek job strain model never investigate . Comparisons emergency health care worker also lack . Therefore , general aim study enhance psychological well-being emergency physician . The primary objective verify preliminary finding Karasek score large sample size emergency physician . The secondary objective evaluate whether change perception work short-term ( leave 24-hour shift ) long-term ( professional experience ) . We explore relationship biomarkers stress protective factor . Moreover , aim compare emergency health care worker specificity . Questionnaires saliva collection perform twice : begin day work end night work . Both measure record time within participant , 6.30 8.30 depend health care worker . The time require participant evaluate 15min time . The measure repeat every year 5 year assess long term change subjective objective measure stress . The population description achieve descriptive statistic . Continuous variable present mean standard deviation , normality distribution condition ( Shapiro-Wilk need ) . The primary analysis mainly descriptive express ( quantitative categorical variable ) perception score emergency physician work accord Karasek questionnaire , dimension compose score ( decision latitude , psychological demand social support ) . The evolution Karasek questionnaire score , obtain dimension , test pair two-sample emergency physician 's test ( nonparametric Wilcoxon test necessary ) . Linear regression model aleatory effect model ( describe Klar Darlington , 2004 , Statistics Medicine ) eventualy complete analyzes . This permit , multivariate analyzes introduction covariates , seek possible explanatory factor Karasek score evolution . The process use quantitative parameter collect . All statistical analysis perform bilateral test p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Statistical analyzes perform use STATA 12 software ( Stata Corporation , College Station ) .</detailed_description>
