	<detailed_description>Feasibility effectiveness 'Tell-us Card ' Communication Tool hospital patient ' perception participation quality Care . The use 'Tell-us Cards ' basic care intervention facilitate communication enhance patient participation basic care . The effectiveness card test Jangland et al ( 18 ) population patient admit hospital surgical ward . The use 'Tell-us Card ' patient group result significant improvement patient ability participate decision nurse medical care . In study investigate feasibility effectiveness 'Tell-us card ' three different hospital setting ; patient admit hospital ' surgical medical ward patient attend hospital ' emergency department . Aim : The aim study investigate feasibility effectiveness 'Tell-us Cards ' patient participation basic care three different hospital setting . Description Intervention : The 'Tell-us card ' ( 18 ) tool elicit patient preference need basic care . Patients invite write specific question concern day discharge . 'Tell-us Cards ' hand daily basis patient admit hospital . Patients informal caregiver invite use 'Tell-us Card ' state preference basic care stay hospital . Nurses instruct use 'Tell-us card ' tool dialogue patient make care plan , ward round discharge information session . Design : Feasibility effectiveness 'Tell-us Card ' test control early trial design ( Phase 2B , MRC Framework ) . Trained nurse hand 'Tell-us Cards ' daily basis patient admit hospital . Baseline assessment patient participation conduct ward patient nurse introduction 'Tell-us Cards ' . For baseline assessment ; Nurses patient ask fill questionnaire . The nurse receive questionnaire postbox ward work envelope return questionnaire researcher . Patients ask fill questionnaire one week discharge hospital one week visit emergency department . Assessment effect intervention patient T1 start 3 month introduction 'Tell-us Cards ' intervention ward . Nurses ask fill questionnaire 6 month fill first questionnaire . Patients &amp; Settings : Hospital patient admit two surgical ward two medical ward ( n=4x35=140 ) include study . One surgical ward , one medical ward randomly assign intervention control group . Baseline follow assessment take place 35 patient per assessment per ward , result 165 assessment baseline , 165 assessment follow-up . Outcomes : Primary outcome patient perception participation individualise care . For measurement patient participation patient admit hospital use Individualized Care Scale patient ( 19-23 ) . Secondary outcome comprehend perception quality care , assess Quality Patients ' perspective ( QPP ) questionnaire ( 24 , 25 ) well use content 'Tell-us Cards ' action take nurse consequence patient 'tell ' mean 'Tell-us Cards ' . As generic tool use EQ-5D measurement Quality life ( www.euroqol.org ) one question consumer Quality index patient experience ( www.centrumklantervaringindezorg ) . Furthermore nurse ' perception individualise care assessed baseline follow-up Individualized Care Scale nurse . Analysis : Results cluster ward level . We therefore perform random effect regression model estimate effect ( surgical medical ) patient ' perception Individualised Care intervention versus usual care group follow-up . In analysis , ward enter random effect , covariates model patient ' perception Individualised Care ward baseline . Descriptive analysis reveal topic patient regard important stay . A thorough process analysis use Card en action take consequence content card , give insight feasibility effectiveness 'Tell-us Card ' daily practice . Timeline ( 21 month ) : 1-6 ( 6m ) : Preparation time ; 7-9 ( 3m ) : T0-Baseline assessment ; 10-12 ( 3m ) : 'Tell-us Card ' Intervention Introduction ; 13-15 ( 3m ) : T1-assessment ; 16-21 ( 6m ) : Data analysis study reporting</detailed_description>
