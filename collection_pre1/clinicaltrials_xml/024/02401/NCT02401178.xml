	<brief_summary>The incidence atopic dermatitis increase dramatically year . Atopic dermatitis occurs due complex interaction genetic environmental factor . One gene consistenly link AD occurences filaggrin gene ( FLG gene ) . Mutation gene induce disruption epidermal cytoskeleton aggregation serve form protein-lipid , thereby disrupt skin permeability water outside particle allergens.8-14 Several attempt make prevent occurences progressivity AD , one LCPUFA supplementation . Until , clinical meta-analysis study show inconsistent result , LCPUFA intervention early life give consistent protective result . In study investigator would like know influence FLG gene mutation occurrence atopic dermatitis , know composition LCPUFA early life order see protective effect several LCPUFA , see influence FADS1 FADS2 gene polymorphism towards LCPUFA concentration buccal swab early life time AD occurs , know diet time AD occurrence , know role ratio DHA towards AA level development AD due antagonistic effect , see interaction FLG gene , FADS gene LCPUFA level development AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional design use know role FADS1 FADS2 gene polymorphism LCPUFA composition birth ( buccal swab ) , Extended cross-sectional design used look FLG gene mutation effect predictor emergence atopic dermatitis , FADS1 FADS2 gene polymorphism role atopic dermatitis occurences , role DHA intake DHA AA ratio prevent atopic dermatitis occurences first year life . STUDY POPULATION Target population healthy term newborn . Affordable population healthy term newborn Jakarta . Study sample healthy term newborn Jakarta bear Primary Health Care Kemayoran District , Central Jakarta whose parent consent take part study . METHODS Briefly , filaggrin gene mutation FADS1 FADS2 polymorphism examine umbilical blood LCPUFA level measure buccal swab 400 newborn . The Material Transfer Agreement ( MTA ) Indonesian Health Research Development Institution ( Badan Penelitian dan Pengembangan Kesehatan Republik Indonesia/LITBANGKES ) include . Genotyping do use iPLEX Gold chemistry ( Sequenom ) MALDI-TOF ( matrix assist laser desorption ionization-time flight ) method detect allele difference . Every month , breastfeed ; duration breastfeeding ; formula intake ; much kind formula give , ( regular formula , hypoallergenic formula ) ; monitor . At time complementary feeding breast milk start , dietary analysis Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ ) , monitor body weight , length , head circumference skin condition do . If parent complain presence skin disorder suspicion AD occurfence , investigator 's team ask accompany parent subject Dermatologist . If subject come , home visit do , photograph take . The dermatologist later confirm diagnosis photo . LCPUFA level measurement do buccal swab time atopic dermatitis occur end monitor subject acquire AD .</detailed_description>
