	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Functional Outcomes Awake vs. Asleep Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional DBS perform without general anesthesia patient awake . Local anesthetic use numb skin tissue incision make , patient give mild sedative alleviate anxiety discomfort . Parkinson 's patient need medication awake DBS order obtain single-unit cellular recording locate map desire target . The process electrophysiological mapping result multiple brain penetration lead placement , entire procedure may last anywhere 4-6 hour average . The concept awake brain surgery medication significant concern patient . In addition , widely recognize microelectrode record increase risk hemorrhage DBS surgery . Recently , increase interest perform DBS general anesthesia , stimulate target locate anatomically ( i.e . MRI ) rather physiologically via microelectrode recording . This technology term `` asleep '' DBS perform patient general anesthesia . Intraoperative image utilized verify stereotactic accuracy DBS electrodes placement time surgery . Because stereotactic accuracy ( surgical safety ) surgical endpoint , need patient medication awake procedure . Traditional DBS perform without general anesthesia patient awake . Local anesthetic use numb skin tissue incision make , patient give mild sedative alleviate anxiety discomfort . Parkinson 's patient need medication awake DBS order obtain single-unit cellular recording locate map desire target . The process electrophysiological mapping result multiple brain penetration lead placement , entire procedure may last anywhere 4-6 hour average . The concept awake brain surgery medication significant concern patient . In addition , widely recognize microelectrode record increase risk hemorrhage DBS surgery . The safety efficacy two approach DBS surgery equivalent , position equipoise regard offer patient . To date , randomize , control clinical trial compare efficacy functional outcome two DBS method . After informed consent obtain , patient undergo routine DBS pre-operative evaluation diagnostic testing . This include pre-operative 3T-MRI without gadolinium well pre-operative medical clearance patient 's PCP general practitioner and/or medical specialist necessary . They also receive baseline clinical evaluation include motor function ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale antiparkinsonian medication ) quality life ( Parkinson 's disease Questionnaire-39 ) already complete part routine DBS candidacy evaluation within 2 month surgery . Patients elect participate trial undergo routine pre-operative neurocognitive evaluation consist follow routine evaluative test : Wechsler Test Adult Reading , Mattis Dementia Rating Scale 2nd Edition , Wechsler Abbreviate Scale Intelligence 2nd Edition ; Wechsler Memory Scale 3rd edition , Digit Span , Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test , Trail Making Test , Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , Controlled Oral Word Association Test , Animal Naming , Boston Naming Test , Wechsler Memory Scale 4th Edition , Logical Memory , Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised , Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised , Hooper visual Organization Test , Judgment Line Orientation , Beck Depression Inventory , Beck Anxiety Inventory , Questionnaire Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders Parkinson 's Disease , Apathy Evaluation Scale ; Epworth Sleepiness Scale , The subject randomize 2 group use random number envelope system . We anticipate 120 total patient need enrol pilot study ( 60 awake , 60 asleep ) , thus number 1-120 placed envelope . An odd number correspond awake DBS procedure , even number indicate asleep DBS procedure . The purpose propose study demonstrate functional outcome `` asleep '' technique inferior report traditional `` awake '' DBS technique . The primary data point study include six month functional outcome use accepted metric Parkinson 's disease , include motor function ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale [ UPDRS ] obtain medication `` '' medication `` '' state ) quality life ( Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire-39 ) . The null hypothesis asleep DBS result inferior UPDRS-III score 6-months surgery . Our secondary aim evaluate cognitive change associate DBS surgery selection ( awake vs. asleep ) PD patient . Current standard care patient selection DBS focus primarily evaluation motor symptom currently guidance patient ' DBS surgery selection ( awake vs. asleep ) would impact subsequent neurocognitive function .</detailed_description>
