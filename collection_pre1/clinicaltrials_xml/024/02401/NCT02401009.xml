	<detailed_description>The Research Database contain demographic clinical data allogeneic relate unrelated donor autologous HC transplant . Data also collect unrelated donor donation experience . The data contain research databases observational data . CIBMTR determine therapy use patient , rather collect information regard therapy apply transplant center . Secondary goal CIBMTR Research Program understand use hematopoietic cell regenerative medicine immune-based therapy , include malignancy infection , improve treatment outcomes individual expose radiation chemical toxic marrow . In case , exposure data , organ injury data , treatment data , outcome data collect .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any recipient unrelated related donor autologous HC transplant ( include cell collect peripheral blood , bone marrow cord blood ) recipient cellular therapy CIBMTR center eligible participate Research Database . This include adult without decision making capacity , child . Individual Marrow Toxic Injury Eligibility Criteria In event radiation exposure accident , NMDP radiation injury treatment network , whose purpose collect data understand outcome patient treat circumstance . Any individual treated marrow toxic injury center participate NMDP 's Radiation Injury Treatment Network ( RITN ) eligible participate Research Database . This include adult without decision making capacity , child . Eligible individual may receive supportive care , growth factor support , HC transplant appropriate medical treatment marrow toxic injury . Treatments apply discretion care facility , determine NMDP CIBMTR .
