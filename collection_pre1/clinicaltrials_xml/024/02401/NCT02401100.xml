	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether reduced rectal blood flow associate extent surgery performing operation remove rectal cancer . The investigator also aim describe relation reduce rectal blood flow , well raise inflammatory biomarkers blood tissue , occurrence anastomotic leakage . The patient recruit Ume√• University Hospital patient plan undergo anterior resection rectal cancer able consent eligible study . Rectal blood flow measurement conduct Laser-Doppler technology use noninvasive measuring probe . Preoperative postoperative blood sample well postoperative drain fluid collection take place . Perianastomotic tissue also collect . In postoperative period , occurrence surgical complication especially anastomotic leakage , note . Blood flow biomarkers assess relation type mesorectal excision ( total partial ) correlate anastomotic leakage . Standard statistical tool utilized , parametric , non-parametric test logistic regression , appropriate . The study recruit approximately 90 patient three consecutive year .</brief_summary>
