	<brief_summary>PRONOMOS international multicentre , interventional , parallel , randomised , double-blind non-inferiority study compare rivaroxaban 10mg od active comparator , enoxaparin 4000 UI od 4040 valid subject require orthopaedic surgery ( except low risk material removal foot surgery hallux valgus without patient risk factor [ 6 ] , major orthopaedic surgery femoral neck trochanteric fracture , THR , TKR ) Pre-randomization treatment LMWH anticoagulant allow maximum duration 24 hour . However , single pre-randomization dose LMWH allow . After randomization , patient allocate rivaroxaban arm receive rivaroxaban 10 mg once-daily start 6-10 hour provide haemostasis establish surgery 24h hour LMWH injection need intend treatment duration 2 12 week base medical judgment ( accord immobilization ) . Patients allocate comparator arm receive enoxaparin daily intend treatment duration . All patient 30-day observational period cessation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Major orthopedic surgery ( hip , knee replacement hip fracture ) represent small part orthopaedic surgery procedure . Procedures trauma patient orthopaedic low limb surgery without trauma much frequent ( tibia osteotomy , arthrodesis , ligament repair…. ) . The incidence trauma patient require surgery prolong immobilisation rising , mainly increase popularity recreational sport . However , epidemiology prevention VTE injuries poorly study . The combination limb surgery without trauma orthopaedic surgery responsible increase venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . Usually , surgery low limb consider moderate high risk DVT different duration relate immobilisation . For instance tibia osteotomy high risk least 6 week knee arthroscopy ligament repair moderate risk 10 day . However LMWH recommend surgery . Non-major orthopaedic surgery represent major additional risk factor ; therefore patient undergo surgery deserve receive VTE prophylaxis . Rivaroxaban new oral anticoagulant develop potent anti-Xa activity . In major orthopaedic surgery , show effective safe LMWH ( Enoxaparin 4000 IU daily ) THR TKR patient ( RECORD program ) . Up , pending limited number surgical setting develop orthopaedic surgery , approve prevention venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) THR TKR procedure , represent 20 % orthopaedic intervention . Non-major elective low limb surgery traumatology population young compare prosthetic orthopaedic surgery patient . Fewer VTE cardiovascular event fear . These patient receive quite often injectable thromboprophylaxis total duration lie approximately 6 week 3 month . In one hand , risk major bleed low young population . On hand , compliance cost favour Rivaroxaban , injection platelet count need . The result Xamos descriptive sub-analysis non-elective ( fracture relate ) orthopaedic surgery consistent overall result Xamos favour investigation area . In small subset patient ( n=790 ) , incidence symptomatic thromboembolic event observe low patient treat Xarelto overall frequency treatment emergent major bleeding low group serious adverse event occur less frequently patient treat Xarelto . Therefore , collection clinical data population need await many orthopaedic surgeon anaesthetist charge VTE prophylaxis . The population femoral neck trochanteric fracture specific one different characteristic , elderly , frail high bleeding risk . This population exclude .</detailed_description>
