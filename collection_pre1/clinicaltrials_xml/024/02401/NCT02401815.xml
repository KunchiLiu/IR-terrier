	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn PLX9486 may affect cancer cell certain mutation KIT gene , specifically patient type advance solid tumor include Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST ) . PLX9486 design block KIT gene mutation . These mutation cause cancer cancer cell growth . By block mutation , drug may kill cancer cell mutation and/or stop tumor grow . By combine PLX9486 PLX3397 , investigator hope block gene mutation KIT .</brief_summary>
