	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective study obtain efficacy safety descriptive data 2 different titration algorithm : INSIGHT titration algorithm ( self-titration 1 unit/day ) EDITION trial algorithm insulin glargine 300 units/mL give basal insulin uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patient basal insulin without non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agent ( NIAHA ) insulin naïve patient . Secondary Objective : The secondary objective gain additional efficacy safety data ( glycated hemoglobin [ A1C ] , fast plasma glucose [ FPG ] , 7-point self-measure plasma glucose [ SMPG ] , insulin dose weight ) determine patient relate outcome health care professional satisfaction pertains titration regimen .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus . Patients ≥18 year age . Treated diabetes least 6 month . If basal insulin , stable least 3 month prior screen visit basal insulin treatment ( ) ( ±20 % total insulin dose ) If NIAHA , stable least 8 week prior screen visit NIAHA ( ) ( change dose initiation new NIAHAs ) . Patients uncontrolled basal insulin ( insulin glargine , normal protamine Hagedorn [ NPH ] , detemir ) +/ NIAHAs A1c &gt; 7.0 % ≤10 % uncontrolled NIAHAs ( insulin naïve patient ) A1c &gt; 7.0 % ≤11 % . Signed informed consent form . Exclusion criterion : Patients type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . Nightshift worker . Female patient pregnant lactate . Treatment insulin basal insulin ( premix , rapid insulin , fast act insulin analogue ) within previous 3 month . Patients less 1 year history diabetes . Patients unwilling inject insulin perform selfmonitoring blood glucose . Current alcohol drug abuse . Patients unlikely comply protocol complete study eg , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit . Patients active cancer disease condition opinion Investigator would make patient unsuitable participation study . Any clinically significant laboratory finding judgment Investigator would preclude safe completion study . Known allergy study drug . Participation another clinical study . The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
