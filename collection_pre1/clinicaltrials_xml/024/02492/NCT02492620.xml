	<brief_summary>It investigators hypothesis participant treat Ferric Citrate ( FC ) non-dialysis CKD stage ( 4/5 ) sufficient duration prior initiate RRT , result improve biochemical control anemia ( Hb , TSAT ) mineral metabolism ( P , FGF23 ) furthermore , result reduce need ESA intravenous iron . The investigator hypothesize effective treatment anemia mineral metabolism FC pre-dialysis transition period result improve physical functioning , reduce hospitalization reduce total cost care compare participant receive contemporaneously provide standard care therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ferric Citrate Transition From CKD Stage 4/5 CKD Stage 5D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 50 week , phase 3 , clinical trial patient estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) â‰¤ 20 ml/min/1.73m2 . It comprise 36-week non-dialysis period ( NDP ) , time subject require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) dialysis immediately roll 12-week dialysis period ( DP ) . The study consist 16 clinic visit maximum period 50 week . There screen period 14 day subject randomize NDP 2:1 ratio receive either FC ( n=150 ) SOC ( n=75 ) . Each eligible participant randomize either fix dose open-label ferric citrate ( FC ) standard care ( SOC ) treatment . Participants randomize SOC receive care direct primary nephrologist throughout study duration restriction receive treatment FC NDP DP . Participants randomize FC receive throughout study duration . Approximately 300 participant screen randomize approximately 225 subject 2:1 ( FC : SOC ) NDP . It anticipate 35-45 % participant reach dialysis period ( DP ) 36 week follow . Participants initiate RRT dialysis enter Dialysis Period ( DP ) participants previously assign ferric citrate continue receive open-label ferric citrate previously assign SOC receive open-label , non-FC phosphate binder discretion treat physician . During period participant treat standard care guideline suggest serum phosphate upper limit normal ( 4.5 mg/dL ) , reduce . During DP , dose P binder , use ESA , intravenous iron blood transfusion discretion primary treat nephrologist . Participants assign SOC treatment arm may receive FC point study . Only participants begin permanent RRT dialysis eligible enter 12 week DP . Participants begin RRT 9 month participation NDP deem reach end study end study procedure perform .</detailed_description>
