	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Response-Driven Adaptive Radiation Therapy Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States worldwide . In 2012 , 226,160 new case 160,340 death relate lung cancer United States . Approximately , 80-85 % lung cancer NSCLC ( Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ) , 40 % locally advanced ( stage II/III ) diagnosis . The current standard care patient `` one size fit '' RT ( Radiation Therapy ) concurrent chemotherapy uniform regimen . Even concurrent chemoradiation , however , five year overall survival still 15 % ; almost one half patient fail locally . At time , intensification radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy may result excessive toxicity incomplete treatment . Therefore , critical tailor treatment individual 's sensitivity combination functional imaging guide response-driven treatment biomarker guide individualize dose prescription , thus take consideration tumor toxicity profile . Evidence suggest high-dose radiation potential improve local-regional control overall survival patient treat fractionated therapy concurrent chemotherapy . However , challenge deliver high dose RT majority patient locally advance NSCLC without exceed dos organ risk cause significant side effect . Investigators hypothesize could develop safer effective therapy adapt treatment individual patient 's response . With respect tumor , investigator hypothesize , could improve outcome redistribute dose aggressive region tumor , assess use mid-treatment FDG-PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan . With respect uninvolved organ , investigator need method estimate tolerable radiation dose individual patient rather population average . Such strategy require assess global regional normal lung function technology deliver dose manner minimizes damage functional lung esophagus . During-RT FDG-PET/CT potentially provide important benefit individual patient intensify dose resistent tumor , allow early change alternative , efficacious treatment avoid unnecessary toxicity relate ineffective therapy . Patients also undergo treatment V/Q SPECT ( Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography ) scan , adaptive plan base during-treatment SPECT may optimize PART ( Personalized Adaptive Radiotherapy ) avoid high dose radiation well-functioning region , would thus decrease RILT ( Radiation Induced Lung Toxicity ) . The combination pre- V/Q SPECT classify lung different functional region , strategy give differential priority region develop minimize lung damage . Investigators plan continue collect data serum biomarkers refine biophysical model ultimate goal individualize radiation dose prescription . By identify high risk patient adjust OAR ( Organs Risk ) dose limit threshold tolerance , investigator anticipate significant reduction incidence toxicity UMCC 2007.123 without compromised tumor control apply model optimize radiation planning .</detailed_description>
