	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab After SBRT Versus Pembrolizumab Alone Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize significant subset patient recurrent NSCLC immunotherapy SBRT superior treatment immunotherapy alone SBRT , give single metastatic site tumor , augment immune response tumor . Objectives : Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) , define percentage patient complete response , partial response stable disease 12 week , PFS , define time randomization disease progression death , OS , define time randomization death ( cause ) . Toxicity .</detailed_description>
