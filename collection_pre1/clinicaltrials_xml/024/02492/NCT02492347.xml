	<detailed_description>The study carry maternity unit local district general hospital . It normal practice woman take SSRIs pregnancy deliver local district general hospital , rather home community , due possible problem baby . Currently standard practice plan care baby bear ( ALERT ) generate whilst woman pregnant .

The group mother ask participation baby , require treatment intravenous antibiotic least 36 hour , identify risk infection within 12 hour bear . An infection marker , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) blood measure , remain normal 18 hour baby suitable study , mother give information leaflet invitation letter maternity staff/ ANNPs . Antibiotics continue give baby least 36- 47 hour blood test show whether infection . If n't infection healthy , consider study . Both group baby regularly monitor staff maternity unit make sure problem act quickly . Both group baby would normally hospital 36- 48 hour monitor . When baby group 48-72 hour old , ANNPs ask mother happy baby electrocardiogram ( ECG ) look heart beat pattern . After consideration time , consent form sign , data collection sheet complete , ECG carry baby . This happen ward minimal disruption mother baby .
