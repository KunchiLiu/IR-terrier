Subjects fulfill follow criterion screen ineligible admission : Subjects active autoimmune disease history autoimmune disease , history syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive medication , include limited following : rheumatoid arthritis , pneumonitis , colitis ( inflammatory bowel disease ) , hepatitis , hypophysitis , nephritis , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism , except subject vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy . Subjects follow condition exclude study : asthma require intermittent use bronchodilator , hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement , vitiligo , Graves ' disease , Hashimoto 's disease . Additional exception may make medical monitor approval . Known history hypersensitivity component INCSHR01210 formulation . Concurrent medical condition require use immunosuppressive medication , immunosuppressive dos systemic absorbable topical corticosteroid .

Active CNS metastasis ( indicated clinical symptom , cerebral edema , steroid requirement , progressive disease ) . Subjects brain meningeal metastases previously treat must clinically stable ( magnetic resonance image least 4 week apart show evidence new enlarge metastasis ) discontinue immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week study drug administration .
