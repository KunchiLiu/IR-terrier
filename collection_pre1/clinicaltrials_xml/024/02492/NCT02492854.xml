	<brief_summary>The objective study compare effectiveness standard moist dressing PICO single-use negative pressure dressing post-operative low extremity bypass patient . This study compare dressing ' ability decrease swelling , decrease post-operative infection , improve mobility quality life measure . Subjects ask participate study undergo low extremity bypass use ipsilateral great saphenous vein . Subjects randomize two post-operative treatment group . One group receive standard sterile gauze receive PICO single-use negative pressure dressing . Both group assess study measure follow-up visit clinically indicate 1 year 30 day timepoint primary outcome study measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Versus PICO Dressings Lower-Extremity Bypass Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative infection lower extremity bypass operation ( LEB ) lead devastate consequence . A systematic review lower-extremity ( LE ) re-vascularization case use American College Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( ACS-NSQIP ) find 11.1 % patient diagnosed surgical site infection ( SSI ) . Another main issue LEB swelling , occur 70 % patient lead increased pressure along lead edge often-long wound . A wide variety method decrease post-operative consequence currently part standard practice . These technique include cover incision site sterile gauze dressing , elevate leg , wrap pressure dressing . Patients instructed change dressing home . However , SSI rate demonstrate partially effective measure , remain room improve post-operative management infection swell . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) , past several year , provide way post-operatively manage complex wound ( see device description ) . PICO single-use negative pressure dressing examine previous study . However , either case series , chronic wound , non-vascular procedure . The effectiveness PICO versus standard dressing LEB yet determine prospective , comparative study . Results indicate whether PICO include standard post-operative care lower-extremity bypass patient . This study design compare PICO standard care , determine offer best outcome decrease day ambulation post-operative wound complication .</detailed_description>
