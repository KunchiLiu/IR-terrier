	<brief_summary>This study aim assess effect demand-creation intervention couple ' HIV counsel test ( couple ' HCT ) uptake among married couple never test together couple . The study implement 12 cluster ; six intervention six comparison cluster . A total 1,538 couple enrol study ; 769 couple per arm . Couples intervention community invite participate small group , couple-focused men-only , interactive session last 3-4 hour advantage fear associate couple ' HCT discuss invite couple motivate consider test together couple . The meeting reinforce testimony previously test couple . At end session , couple men receive invitation coupon present designate health facility receive couple ' HCT service ( couple free receive individual HCT honor invitation , interested take HCT offer ) . In comparison community , standard care health education activity include general adult community session hold couple receive invitation test couple . Nevertheless , couple comparison community unlimited access HIV counsel test service offer Rakai Health Sciences Program within study community . The investigator hypothesize couple intervention arm likely test together comparison arm .

	<detailed_description>This cluster-randomized intervention trial aim assess effect community-based demand creation intervention couple ' HIV counsel test ( couple ' HCT ) among 1,538 marry couple prior couple ' HCT experience , resident three study regions/clusters Rakai district . The study population compose couple partner never receive couple ' HCT . The intervention utilize couple-focused meeting men-only meeting promote couple ' HCT invitation coupon issue targeted couple invite come couple ' HCT designate health facility within Rakai district . Initially , qualitative sub-study implement explore motivation barrier couple ' HCT uptake - aspect important design intervention . This follow baseline study document current level HCT uptake community , intervention implementation follow suit . The study implement 12 study community ; 6 serve intervention 6 serve comparison community . Data collection post-intervention survey complete April 2015 . Efforts currently underway assess linkage retention HIV care among couple test result campaign . The study 3 inter-related sub-studies ( objective ) , namely : ( ) Exploring motivation barrier couple ' HCT uptake community level ( b ) Assessing effect demand creation intervention couple ' HCT uptake among married couple prior couple ' HCT , ( c ) Determining effect couple ' HCT relative individual HCT linkage retention HIV care among HIV-positive HIV-discordant couple yet HIV care . Sub-study I comprise use qualitative research method explore motivation barrier couple ' HCT uptake 18 focus group discussion ( FGDs ) 12 key informant interview . Findings sub-study help inform design demand-creation HCT intervention aim improve couple ' HCT uptake select community Rakai . Sub-study II one-year community intervention trial aim assess effect demand-creation intervention ( comprise couple-focused meeting ; couple invitation coupon ; men-only sensitization meeting ) couple ' HCT uptake among couple prior couple ' HCT experience . The study implement 3 study region differ HIV prevalence level ( low ( 9.7-11.2 % ) , middle ( 11.4-16.4 % ) high ( 20.5-43 % ) ) Rakai district . Overall , 1,538 eligible couple invite participate baseline study . Of , 2,135 interview baseline follow 12 month later . In sub-study III , investigator enroll 462 couple least one partner HIV-positive follow 1 , 3 6 month HIV diagnosis determine effect couple ' HCT [ vis-Ã -vis individual HCT ] timely linkage retention HIV care . To estimate sample size intervention , investigator assume minimum improvement couple ' HCT uptake 10 % intervention community compare baseline 25 % standard care/comparison community ( Grabowski et al . 2014 ) . The investigator set two-sided alpha level 0.05 assumed power 90 % detect difference proportion couple accept couple ' HCT intervention comparison community . The investigator use 12 study communities/clusters account cluster design effect use intra-class correlation 0.0039 base early study Rakai ( Todd et al . 2003 ) . Based assumption , investigator estimate would need enroll 769 couple arm ( i.e . intervention comparison community ) , adjust non-response rate ( out-migration , refusal participate , loss follow-up ) estimate 15 % ( Gray et al . 2007 ) . The final sample 1,538 couple ( 3,076 individual ) . Sample size estimation do use sampsi sampclus command STATA ( STATA statistical software , version 11.2 ) .</detailed_description>
