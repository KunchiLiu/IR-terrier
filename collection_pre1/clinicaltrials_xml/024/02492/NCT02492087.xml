	<detailed_description>1.1 BACKGROUND Maternal haemorrhage significant cause maternal mortality morbidity worldwide . The incidence postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH ) blood loss excess 1000ml estimate affect 10.5 % live birth globally . This translate stagger number 14 million woman reproductive age group suffers complication severe blood loss childbirth every year . While case fatality rate low around 1 % , non-fatal health outcome result PPH remain unknown compound considerable variability patient tolerance towards blood loss . Certainly , parturients experience similar risk bleed pregnancy . However , important consider even small amount blood loss may detrimental effect maternal health especially parturients preexist medical condition like anaemia cardiac disease . Measures aim address global problem need give top priority line United Nations Fifth Millennium Developmental Goal improve maternal health reduce maternal mortality ratio 75 % year 2015 . Parturients undergo caesarean section experience blood loss compare counterpart deliver vaginally . Recent study report average blood loss 254ml 304ml vaginal delivery 500ml 592ml caesarean delivery . Identifying risks cause PPH recognise PPH significant contributor maternal mortality morbidity important encourage effort early identification parturients risk bleeding . However , despite advance modern obstetrics , PPH remain significant problem develop world also country high resource well medical facility presumably efficient protocol management PPH existence.Obviously , indicate need explore new method effective prevention treatment PPH quest improve maternal health . 1.2 INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT AND MECHANISM OF ACTION Tranexamic acid , tissue plasmin plasminogen inhibitor , widely use drug show benefit reduce blood loss various surgical specialty . It act reversible block lysine binding site plasminogen prevent activation plasmin . This inhibit fibrinolytic process prevent breakdown polymerized fibrin , necessary blood clot form . In study , investigator propose use prophylactic administration topical tranexamic acid give intra-operatively parturients moderate high risk bleed undergoing caesarean section , part blood conservation strategy aid surgical haemostasis reduce blood loss . This relatively simple easy administer route tranexamic acid postulate inhibit local fibrinolytic process site tissue injury . Bleeding caesarean section occur surgical incision site , vessel injury placental separation site uterus . The investigator postulate apply tranexamic acid locally sit , reduction blood loss achieve thus help prevent occurrence PPH reduce risk blood transfusion . 1.3 CLINICAL DATA TO DATE A systematic review conduct past use systemic topical tranexamic acid trauma , cardiac , spine arthroplasty surgery mostly show favourable outcome . However , evidence use tranexamic acid obstetrics patient remain limited . A Cochrane review 2010 tranexamic acid prevent PPH confirms poor state evidence area . The EXADELI ( EXAcyl treatment DELIvery haemorrhage ) study show reduction median blood loss 6 hour treatment group receive high dose tranexamic acid ( 4g 1h follow 1g/h ) woman develop PPH 800ml within 2 hour vaginal delivery . There also large international multi-centred randomise control trial currently progress investigate use systemic tranexamic acid treat PPH vaginal caesarean delivery ( WOMAN trial ) outcome await eagerly . Both study explore use systemic tranexamic acid treatment PPH diagnosis make . However , study explore use topical tranexamic acid give prophylactically reduce bleed patient undergoing caesarean delivery aid surgical haemostasis intra-operatively . 1.4 DOSE RATIONALE The optimum dose topical tranexamic acid require reduce bleed know . According Cochrane review topical tranexamic acid , overall 29 % reduction blood loss topical tranexamic acid analyze 29 study involve 2612 patient . The concentration tranexamic acid use trial range 0.7mg/ml 100 mg/ml saline solution . The dose topical tranexamic acid use study select base finding systemic review meta-analysis use topical tranexamic acid total knee replacement demonstrate dose &gt; 2g significantly reduce transfusion requirement . This support recent review topical tranexamic acid hip knee arthroplasty 2014 suggest great reduction blood loss transfusion increase dose . The investigator use 2g 20mls solution tranexamic acid dilute 100mls normal saline 0.9 % yield concentration 16.7mg/ml saline solution topical tranexamic acid postulate concentration tranexamic acid result 25 % reduction bleeding base exist clinical data . 1.5 OFF LABEL ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION Tranexamic acid commonly prescribed oral intravenous form . It good safety profile even give systemically adverse effect related topical route postulate less compare standard route administration due reduce systemic absorption drug . Furthermore , topical tranexamic acid already use clinical practice many country many systematic review attest efficacy safety . Approval off-label route administration drug obtain National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau Ministry Health , Malaysia prior commencement trial . 1.6 POTENTIAL RISKS Tranexamic acid well-documented safety profile . When give systemically ( oral intravenous ) adverse effect detail Table 1 . Table 1 : Adverse Effects Systemic Tranexamic Acid Common ( may affect 1 10 user ) • Effects stomach intestine : nausea , vomit , diarrhoea ( especially oral route ) Uncommon ( may affect 1 10 1000 user ) • Effects skin : rash Rare ( frequency know available data ) - Effects haematological system : malaise hypotension ( especially inject quickly intravenously ) , arterial venous thrombosis - Effects nervous system : convulsion ( case misuse high dos intravenous tranexamic acid give ) - Effects eye : vision disturbance include impaired colour vision - Effects immune system : allergic reaction ( For comprehensive list , please refer product information leaflet . ) The topical route tranexamic acid choose investigator hypothesize topical administration compare systemic route would offer comparable clinical benefit control bleeding time safer term cause potential adverse effect . The advantage target action drug site bleeding reduce systemic absorption topical tranexamic acid mean adverse effect likely rare relevance list follow : Table 2 : Potential Adverse Effects Topical Tranexamic Acid - Effects haematological system : arterial venous thrombosis - Effects immune system : allergic reaction Although tranexamic acid may theoretically increase risk thromboembolic event , systematic review drug 2007 give intravenously demonstrate statistically significant increase risk thromboembolic event show Table 3 . Table 3 : Effects Tranexamic Acid Events Relative Risk ( 95 % CI ) Myocardial infarction 0.96 ( 0.48-1.90 ) Stroke 1.25 ( 0.47-3.31 ) Deep vein thrombosis 0.77 ( 0.37-1.61 ) Renal Failure 0.73 ( 0.16-3.32 ) The investigator therefore conclude topical tranexamic acid likely minimal side effect study subject . 1.7 POTENTIAL BENEFITS Significant advantage use topical tranexamic acid systemic administration would include ease use , target direct action drug site bleed reduction systemic complication , risk drug enter foetal circulation drug administer delivery baby placenta , reduce adverse effect drug mother breast feed baby systemic absorption drug unlikely significant . Ideally , also measure serum tranexamic acid compare level systemic administration dose drug do due limitation cost resource . If find effective , investigator ' study potential health benefit mother moderate high risk bleed caesarean section reduce blood loss surgery also complication associate bleeding . The use topical tranexamic acid incorporate routine everyday use group patient practice easily implement even hospital limit resource , simple , inexpensive minimal adverse effect . Reduced bleed well surgical haemostasis also translate short operating time , reduce risk blood transfusion , good patient outcome saving cost healthcare . 1.8 SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING Parturients plan caesarean section increase risk bleed state inclusion criterion would refer investigate team screening . Subjects fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion consent participate study proper explanation would recruit . Written inform consent obtain every patient prior participation study . The investigator shall inform every subject detail regard nature study , purpose , treatment probability random assignment treatment group , aspect study experimental , procedure involve , possible risk , reasonably expect benefit expect duration approximate number subject involve responsibility . Consent obtain voluntary basis refusal participate study affect patient 's subsequent medical treatment relationship treat physician . Advance information provide possible parturients identify moderate high risk bleed antenatal follow . This include brief summary trial Patient Information Sheet , make available antenatal clinic . All parturients plan elective surgery recruit pre-operative assessment one day prior surgery . Parturients plan emergency surgery fulfill eligibility criterion study approach agreement obstetric team soon decision caesarean section make . The Patient Information Sheet provide study discuss inform write consent obtain . Parturients urgent indication surgery time caesarean section would critical determine maternal and/or foetal outcomes recruit would insufficient time give proper inform consent participate study . Patients deem competent give proper consent result alter state mind due exist illness , suffer severe pain side effect drug give exclude trial . 1.9 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS Subjects may withdraw study study investigator prior expect completion subject safety concern failure subject adhere protocol requirement arise recruitment process ( e.g . disease progression , new contraindication use tranexamic acid , change plan surgery patient may longer fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion ) . Patients enrol trial may also withdraw consent discontinue participation time without penalty loss benefit otherwise entitle subsequent medical treatment relationship treat physician affect . The study investigator would seek document reason ( ) subject consent withdrawal documentation purpose unless subject refuse divulge reason ( ) withdrawing study , whereby decision would respect . In event subject consent withdrawal , study investigator would clarify subject whether wish withdraw component trial would allow follow-up data collection activity continue importance obtain follow-up safety data subject would explain . All data already collect point subject withdrawal retain analysed attempt would also make obtain permission subject withdraw record follow-up safety data end subject follow-up period describe protocol . 1.10 METHODS OF RANDOMIZATION Patients recruit trial randomize 2 treatment group ; TXA group ( Tranexamic acid 2g 20mls solution dilute 100mls sterile sodium chloride 0.9 % solution ) Control group ( 120mls sterile sodium chloride 0.9 % solution ) use software Research Randomizer ( www.randomizer.org ) refer Group A Group B respectively . This random assignment keep sealed envelope mark number correspond sequence patient 's recruitment study . 1.11 STUDY PROCEDURES 1 . The investigator apply special permission National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau Ministry Health , Malaysia off-label route administration tranexamic acid prior commencement trial . 2 . Ethics approval obtain Malaysia Research Ethics Committee . 3 . Patients fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study . 4 . Written inform consent obtain patient randomize 2 group : The TXA group receive 2g topical tranexamic acid dilute 100 ml sodium chloride 0.9 % surgery whereas Control group receive 120ml sodium chloride 0.9 % . 5 . Patients ' risk factor bleed caesarean section assess document . 6 . The surgical team conduct caesarean section carry surgery similar manner patient anaesthetise per local practice . Only patient receive regional anaesthesia include study . Patients plan general anaesthesia recruit require conversion general anaesthesia recruitment due various reason ( i.e . fail regional anaesthesia , prolonged operation , maternal request ) prior administration study therapy drop study reason drop clearly document case report form ( CRF ) . 7 . The study therapy administer delivery baby placenta . The attend surgeon first attempt secure initial haemostasis apply clamp end surgical incision uterus . The placenta remove completely two piece gauze use thoroughly evacuate remnant conception upper low segment uterus ( incision site ) ensure remnant stick placental bed . The solution contain study drug syringe gallipot use sterile 20ml syringe . 60mls solution apply topically placental bed identify surgeon carry surgery spray solution cavity placental bed . Another 30mls solution apply open incision wound . The surgeon proceed close first layer uterus usual manner . After closure first layer , repair incision dry abdominal pack . Any active spurting vessel secure prior apply remain sample study drug solution . Once surgeon satisfy active vessel bleeder , another 30mls study drug solution apply topically closed incision wound similar manner . The rest surgery carry per routine practice . 8 . At end surgery , intra-operative blood loss document circulate nurse anaesthetist charge . Blood loss suction bottle measure gauzes drape soak blood weigh use sensitive weigh scale ( 0.01g accuracy ) total blood loss document CRF . Care take separate amniotic fluid loss actual blood loss use different suction catheter operation . 9 . Intra-operative blood loss calculate use follow formula : Total intra-operative blood loss ( ml ) = . Blood volume measure suction bottle ii . Plus ( + ) wet weight gauzes drape soak blood iii . Minus ( - ) dry weight gauze drape soak blood ( Assumption 1 gram blood equivalent 1 ml blood ) 10 . Haematocrit level monitor baseline ( prior caesarean section ) 6 hour post-operatively . 11 . Subjects haemoglobin less 70g/dl clinical symptom anemia transfuse . All blood product transfuse intra-operatively first 24 hour surgery document . 12 . Use additional uterotonics addition routine 5 unit oxytocin bolus delivery baby subsequent maintenance 40 unit oxytocin 6 hour document CRF . 13 . Patients massive haemorrhage may benefit use systemic antifibrinolytics base judgement attend physician give tranexamic acid intravenously antifibrinolytics accord clinical requirement type drug dosage give document CRF . 14 . Patients follow till time discharge length stay hospital compare . Complications rate ( number event ) post caesarean section result bleeding ( i.e . relaparotomy , hysterectomy , internal iliac artery ligation , embolization ) mortality also compare group patient . 15 . Serious adverse event ( SAR ) potentially relate use topical tranexamic acid ( e.g . allergic reaction thrombotic event include myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis ) monitor closely attend physician time discharge . The principal investigator inform immediately event patient refer medical intensive care unit management . A report regard SAR submit relevant authority . 16 . Subjects follow 30 day post caesarean section telephone email discharge hospital adverse event make know investigator patient primary team document CRF . 1.12 STATISTICAL PLAN Sample size calculation do use Power Sample Size Calculation Version 3.0 January 2009 . The average blood loss expect low segment caesarean section estimate around 600 ± 187ml.5 A 25 % reduction blood loss predict use topical tranexamic acid . A sample size 36 patient per arm would require study assume power 90 percent significant level 0.05 . A 20 percent drop rate project , therefore total 84 patient enrol 42 patient arm study . All data collect CRF . The data key use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Program Windows Version 19 . All dosed subject include data analysis . Data collect assessed distribution . Continuous , numerical parametric data ( e.g . total blood loss measure , haematocrit trend group ) analyse use independent student t-test . Non-parametric numerical data analyse use Mann Whitney-U test else categorical data collect test use Chi-square test ( e.g . risk factor bleed , transfusion requirement ) appropriate .</detailed_description>
