	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine IBD patient home monitoring web app 's disease activity ( DA ) fecal calprotectin ( FC ) demand ( OD ) , compare patient home monitoring schedule interval combine `` demand '' ( SI+OD ) ( every 3.month ) . Will home monitoring DA FC OD v SI+OD reduce frequency relapse one year follow ? Is frequent FC measurement SI+OD test group predictive early recognition relapse , thus help change naturel course disease ? Will home monitoring DA FC OD v SI+OD change course disease term disease activity , spread disease , hospitalization number hospitalization day , require surgery outpatient visit ? Is difference patient ' compliance treatment plan OD v SI+OD ? Is difference patients-adherence OD v SI+OD ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Among 2.500 IBD patient investigator consecutively Gastroenterology out-patient clinic North Zealand University Hospital recruit total 120 study . At out-patient consultation IBD patient inform project IBD eHealth nurse ensure exclusion criterion meet patient . Inclusion criterion : IBD patient remission , SCCAI ≤ 2 ( Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index ) ) HBI &lt; 5 ( Harvey &amp; Bradshaw Activity Index ) mild moderate disease activity ( SCCAI 3-4 , HBI &lt; 16 ) IBD patient read , speak understand Danish IBD patient take advantage Internet wireless network 18years older . Exclusion criterion : IBD patient severe disease activity HB &gt; 16 SCCAI ≥ 5 ) IBD patient social , medical psychological issue complex character IBD patient particularly complex issue drug alcohol problem , severe mental / psychiatric disorder / serious social impact . IBD patient attend due language barrier cognitive disorder . Age less 18 . When patient agree participate study , randomize either OD SI OD 3 . Months ( SI group ) : Patients log www.noh.constant-care.dk least every 3rd month throughout project period 12 month . When patient log telemedicine platform follow score must fill : 1 . - Disease activity , respectively SCCAI HBI . 2 . - Quality life assessment , - IBDQ every 3rd month . 3 . - FACIT ( Fatigue score ) 4 . - MARS ( Medical Adherence Rating Scale ) - FC , fecal calprotectin mg / kg feces ) SMART phone , rapid home test . If patient prefer send feces test , test Gastro unit lab . hospital SMART phone . The result score system appear health professional patient traffic light turn red , yellow green . If patient experience recurrence disease , move green either yellow red area traffic graph , patient instruct contact Gastro medical clinic project nurse early consultation decision treatment initiative . This also indicated patient 's website . If alarm symptom occur patient instructed contact project nurse . Thus patient treat accordance national international guideline . By screen inflammation burden decision move forward . On Demand Group : Patients log demand , detect disease activity , quality life FC start , subsequently need end study ( 12 month ) . At relapse disease activity score FC settle repeat later 7 day remission new DA FC test perform verify remission . Statistical consideration : Randomization Suitable ( N = 120 ) randomize one test group seal envelope principle . Material size calculation : A relapse last median 18 day patient inflammatory bowel disease , variance large ( 10-50 day ) . During one year prevalent IBD patient group 50 % patient population experience relapse . To assess whether few patient experience true `` red '' indicate relapse via ( TIBS ) Feces Calprotectin ( FC ) disease activity group 1 vs. Group 2 respectively , sample size depict TIBS statistically significance ( α ) 0.05 , test force ( β ) 0.8 . This mean must include 53 individual group , mean must include total 106 . Thus investigator choose include 120 patient , 60 group order correct possible small drop group .</detailed_description>
