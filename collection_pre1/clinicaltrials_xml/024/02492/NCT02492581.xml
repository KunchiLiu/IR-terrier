	<brief_title>Use Selincro Impact Usual Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selincro® ( nalmefene ) obtain European market authorisation indicate `` reduction alcohol consumption adult patient alcohol dependence high drinking risk level , without physical withdrawal symptom require immediate detoxification '' . The French health authority ( Haute Autorité de Santé , HAS , Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et de produits de santé , ANSM ) request evaluation real-life condition use Selincro impact morbidity . In response , USE-PACT develop : cohort patient initiate Selincro® one-year follow-up . The primary objective evaluate change alcohol consumption one year patient initiate Selincro® usual practice . The secondary objective : - Describe prescriber characteristic , - Describe initial demographic , clinical , biological characteristic patient start treatment , - Describe patient support , notably psychosocial , start treatment treatment , - Describe characteristic Selincro® treatment study period , - Describe frequency adverse effect Selincro® treatment . It prospective cohort patient initiate Selincro® perform use random sample general practitioner ( GPs ) , psychiatrist physicians practice specialise structure . 600 patient require obtain precision ± 5 % relative variation alcohol consumption g/day one year , standard deviation 63 % 95 % confidence interval , i.e . 1000 patient include take account 40 % loss-to-follow-up . 2500 GPs 2500 psychiatrist contact hypothesis 10 % accept 7 % active physician physicians/specialised structure directory French alcohology society . It thus expect 175 GPs , 175 psychiatrist 85 physician practice specialised structure , base hypothesis average 2 patient per GP psychiatrist , 4 physician practice specialised structure . Each participate physician , 4-month period : - Include cohort patient he/she initiate Selincro® treatment fulfil eligibility criterion , maximum 6 patient per physician ; - Record non-inclusion register patient Selincro® initiate included cohort , maximum 10 patient per physician ; The physician clinical evaluation time inclusion follow patient include cohort accord usual practice , clinical evaluation 1 month ± 8 day ( M1 ) , 3 month ± 15 day ( M3 ) , 6 month ± 30 day ( M6 ) , 9 month ± 30 day ( M9 ) , 12 month ± 30 day ( M12 ) perform usual follow-up consultation . In parallel , include patient also complete self-administered questionnaire time inclusion . Then , receive complete self-administered questionnaire 5 follow-up period ( M1 , M3 , M6 , M9 M12 ) . Patients declare lost-to-follow-up , require , his/her general practitioner contact telephone coordinate centre order fill-out `` last known status questionnaire '' . For patient could reach , vital status investigate use INSEE/INSERM centralised procedure define decree . A descriptive analysis use SAS® software conduct basis detailed statistical analysis plan develop submit validation scientific committee analysis , accord follow principle : - For total population , accord prescriber speciality ( GP , psychiatrist , physician practice specialised structure ) , existence previous medicinal treatment ; - `` Flow chart '' present process physician recruitment patient inclusion ; - Description prescriber characteristic ; - Description treat patient ; - Description change alcohol consumption ( primary secondary criterion ) : - Principal analysis multiple imputation miss data patient follow one year miss Total Alcohol Consumption ( TAC ) /Heavy Drinking Days ( HDD ) , - First sensitivity analysis without multiple imputation , - Second sensitivity analysis multiple imputation miss data patient follow one year miss TAC/HDD well lost-to-follow-up ; - Description follow-up ; - Description Selincro® treatment ; - Description frequency adverse event . Representativeness : - Comparison characteristic common include patient registry ; - Comparison initial characteristic patient follow 1 year follow 1 year ; - Comparison characteristic patient include cohort respect patient extract national health insurance database ( EGB : Echantillon Généraliste de Bénéficiaires ) . Adjustments could perform imbalance respect EGB data order produce representative data .</detailed_description>
