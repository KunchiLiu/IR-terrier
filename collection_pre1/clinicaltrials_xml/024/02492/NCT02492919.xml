	<brief_summary>There grow incidence sepsis septic shock people surgery , may several reason : elderly people severe illness enter operating theatre , invasive system use take care patient intensive care unit , etc ... Sepsis septic shock prevalent illness cause high mortality intensive care unit . The incidence illness 500,000 / year USA , 240-400 / 100,000 person Europe . So subject great interest hospital also National Health System ( health worker health authority ) lot money spend illness . Since 19th century , ultraviolet ray know able sterilize microorganism ( kill ) ; yet ultraviolet system machine market , , control nosocomial infection . The Medixair system , aim , recently come market . It use C-ultraviolet ray , strong kind ultraviolet ray kill microorganism . Thus , interest know whether system good enough low infection intensive care unit . It logical believe few micro-organism , low possibility infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medixair® System Surgical Site Infection Cardiac Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Prospective , comparative , randomize , non intervention study Patients Patients old 18 year Cardiac Surgery anesthetize use Extracorporeal Circulation Randomization There 10 independent box Postoperative Cardiac Intensive Care Unit . ( Each box single bed ) . Every year , Cardiac Reanimation Unit hospital receive 500 patient , post heart surgery . After get permission need make research , Medixair® system place 5 unit , comparison group 5 bed without Medixair® . Patients assign randomly either ( Medixair® NO Medixair® ) . The endpoint : -To compare infection rate cardiac surgery , patient locate box without Medixair® system . The aim see few catheter infection , less bacteraemia , few urinary infection , less site surgery infection , few pneumonias patient spend first day heart surgery box Medixair® system without . The infection rate intensive care unit follow , well whole stay hospital , might fewer infection few microorganism around . Other objective : - Identifying preoperative , intraoperative postoperative risk factor develop infection illness cardiac surgery , well increase length stay hospital mortality rate . - Making economic study use system use . A aim measure follow variable : - Dependent variable ( Outcome variable ) : infection - 2º Outcome variable : colonization - Independent variable risk factor infection : - Preoperative : age , sex , preoperative illness , immunosuppressor treatment , include corticosteroid . - Intraoperative : antibiotic prophylaxis , surgical technique , length cardiopulmonary bypass , length aorta clamp , temperature cardiopulmonary bypass , hematocrit end cardiopulmonary bypass . - Postoperative : length mechanical ventilation , time spent hospital , time spend intensive care unit , organ complication ( pulmonary insufficiency , renal failure , low cardiac index ) , septicemia , invasive technique use , positive microorganism culture . All patient treat way Estimated number patient Nowadays , infection rate cardiac surgery around 5 % , follow current hypothesis Medixair® system , ultraviolet emission , go low infection rate cardiac surgery , 419 patient need group able demonstrate significative 5 % reduction infection rate , alpha error 0.05 beta error 0.2 power 80 % . As preliminary study , order demonstrate 5 % reduction infection rate , half number patient ( half 419 ) use . As patient volume 500 year , number round 500 , order able consider complete year .</detailed_description>
