	<brief_title>Induction With SVF Derived MSC Living-related Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective trial determine autologous SVF derive MSC effectively reduce need post transplant immunosuppressant living-relative kidney transplantation . Emphasis place safety autologous SVF derive MSC infusion , dosage immunosuppressant , GFR , percentage acute rejection . 120 patient eligible study describe enrol , 60 patient intervention group 60 control group . In interventional group collect SVF recipient special instrument transplantation , culture SVF abstain MSC . The abstained MSC infuse recipient living-relative kidney transplantation operation 7 , 14 , 21 POD . We assess whether induction therapy autologous SVF derive MSC feasible living-relative donor kidney transplantation . The effectiveness autologous SVF derive MSC induction therapy reduce immunosuppressant , reduce rate rejection , elevate patient allograft survival , improve allograft function day 0 12 month transplantation . Additionally , assess percentage acute rejection antibody mediate rejection Banff criterion , incidence delay graft function ( defined need post-transplant dialysis within one week ) , incidence adverse event include infection , grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity , grade 4 hematologic toxicity .</detailed_description>

Donors recipient know hepatitis B surface antigenpositive PCR positive hepatitis B 10 . Donors recipient know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection 11 . Recipients risk tuberculosis ( TB ) 1 . Current clinical , radiographic laboratory evidence active latent TB determine local standard care 2 . History active TB : ( I ) . Within last 2 year , even treat ( II ) Greater 2 year ago , unless documentation adequate treatment accord locally accept clinical practice c. Recipients risk reactivation TB preclude administration conventional immunosuppressant ( determine investigator base upon appropriate evaluation ) 12 . Recipients significant infection contraindication would preclude transplant 13 . Recipients history hypercoagulabale state 14 .
