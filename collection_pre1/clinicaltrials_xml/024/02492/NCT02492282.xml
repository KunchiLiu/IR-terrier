	<detailed_description>Total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) technique general anesthesia administer intravenously , exclusively , combination drug absence anesthetic agent inhaled1 . TIVA development closely link perfusion system ; make total intravenous anesthesia enjoy several advantage high hemodynamic stability , anesthetic depth balance , rapid predictable recovery , less medication administer , less pollution lower toxicity , patient also surgical equipment 2,3 , 4 . Two method control drug administration distinguish : open-loop closed-loop control . Open loop control apply pharmacokinetics ( PK ) /pharmacodynamics ( PD ) model base estimation concentration drug certain part body , without measure concentration real time . The inaccuracy result absolute concentration require clinician manually titrate dosage objective observation base concentration desire therapeutic effect . This titration require high clinical experience process intensive monitoring , may divert attention critical situation turn lead suboptimal therapy even put safety risk patient5 , 6 . The application closed-loop system administration anesthetic require perfect balance basic component system type : variable control specific therapeutic effect ; target value variable ( usually call set point ) ; actuator control ( case , drug infusion pump ) ; system ( case patient ) ; control algorithm7 . This system exclude control anesthesiologist drug infusion determine one clinical variable directly reflect relationship PK / PD previously establish attend anesthesiologist . The controller automatically calculate optimal rate infusion base current value desire value control variable previously establish mathematical model . With appearance electroencephalographic monitoring practice control variable , begin conduct study ass cerebral effect anesthetic . Linear model two compartment use describe relationship drug concentration adaptive controller system use subsequently use EEG study interaction opioid propofol 8,9 . After market bispectral index derive EEG , begin evaluate closed loop system use BIS technology several study conclude system make predictable anesthetic depth , provide great intraoperative hemodynamic stability early recovery sedative hypnotic effect propofol 10,11,12,13,14 . Closed loop system intravenous anesthesia effective maintain depth anesthesia compare manual system open , unclear driver variable achieve goal physiological accurately ; literature doesn´t exist study show closed-loop system hypnotic opioid well control pharmacokinetic model open loop system maintain anesthetic depth . In addition , infusion opioid lack physiological controller close loop . Thus , system design intravenous anesthesia close loop propofol hypnotic base neuromonitoring bispectral index anesthetic depth , integrate additional close system remifentanil use hemodynamic variable control algorithm associate bispectral index . The purpose study determine therapeutic effectiveness new system administration intravenous anesthesia close loop maintain depth anesthesia compare open loop system TCI .</detailed_description>
