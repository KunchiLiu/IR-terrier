	<brief_summary>This study target patient cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy allow u : ) study peripheral neuropathy diverse human sensory neuron way possible previously ; b ) gain insight druggable target treat prevent devastating side effect chemotherapy ; c ) provide human cellular model use screen drug determine neurotoxic . The combination patient information vitro measurement provide highly relevant clinically useful model study aim impact treatment selection individual cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishing Neuronal-like Cells From Patients With Cisplatin-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective-To establish biobank specimen allow future creation iPS cell potential make human neuron functional study specific genes/genetic variant . Secondary Objectives-To develop clinically relevant vitro model cisplatin induced peripheral neuropathy use 1 ) screen new drug treatment prevention peripheral neuropathy ; 2 ) evaluate candidate gene role cisplatin induce neuropathy . Study Procedures-Subjects wish participate undergo follow study procedure , perform informed consent document obtain : 1 . Sample Collection-A trained phlebotomist conduct blood draw collection SIX sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) isolation infectious disease test . 2 . Patient Self-Report Toxicities-All patient study ask fill Patient-reported Toxicity Form . This take approximately 10 minute complete consist 20 question related patient symptom describe toxicity experience secondary receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . They ask fill form twice : ( 1 ) describe peripheral neuropathy currently experience ( 2 ) describe bad peripheral neuropathy toxicity experience result cisplatin therapy . These paper form fill time enrollment study . 3 . Physician Report Toxicities-The patient 's physician designatee complete adverse event form day enrollment detail physician 's assign grade toxicity ( accord CTCAE version 4.3 ) experience cisplatin . Other information regard particularly severe neurotoxicity may also collect physician ( e.g . patient use walker wheelchair , patient application disability base neuropathy ) . 4 . General Information- This information collect time point study procedure ( i.e. , Day One ) . This include may limit : age , height , weight , patient-identified race ethnicity , information chemotherapy regimen , total cisplatin dose administer date last cisplatin dose . 5 . Cisplatin Dose-Total cumulative dose cisplatin administer record . Outside record obtain need . 6 . Follow-up Duration Follow-Up-There subsequent patient follow-up time enrollment . Subjects may withdraw consent specimen use contact PI writing .</detailed_description>
