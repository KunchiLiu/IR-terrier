	<brief_summary>Migraine headache frequent Emergency Department complaint . While first-line Emergency Department treatment condition well-established , optimal second-line treatment option well-defined . First line Emergency Department treatment include Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) , dopamine antagonist . Second line treatment propose include triptans , steroid , antiepileptic , benzodiazepine , magnesium narcotic , none show reliable Emergency Department efficacy ( le 50 % study ) . In past ten year several case series publish use low , sub-anesthetic dos propofol treatment refractory migraine . These case series report impressive efficacy rate , especially comparison publish efficacy rate second-line treatment . Personal experience use treatment modality also yield impressive clinical result . Most published series , however , conduct Emergency Department . The Investigators propose conduct prospective , observational trial low-dose propofol treatment refractory migraine Emergency Department . Propofol frequently-used Emergency Department sedative , good safety profile administer experienced Emergency Medicine practitioner use appropriate monitoring . The primary outcome measurement reduction pain treatment , secondary outcome measure relate safety treatment continuation pain relief leave Emergency Department . Although protocol involve use low-dose propofol aim achieve light-to-moderate sedation , patient care monitor level appropriate deep procedural sedation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Propofol Treatment Severe Refractory Migraine Headache Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , observational trial ass basic efficacy safety Emergency Department treatment environment . Emergency Department patient Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia , migraine type headache ( International Headache Classification ) , continue severe ( 6/10 great ) pain one hour receive adequate first-line treatment dopamine antagonist ( prochlorperazine metoclopramide ) NSAID ( ketorolac ibuprofen ) approach possible inclusion . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion give informed consent , include consent procedural sedation . Patients decline participate continue headache treat ED team per usual practice . After enrollment , patient set procedural sedation per standard Emergency Department protocol . This include well-running peripheral IV ; continuous monitoring telemetry , pulse oximetry , capnography automate blood pressure check ; continuous bedside monitor Emergency Department nurse Emergency Department attend senior resident ( immediate attend availability ) ; airway management tool include suction , oxygen , Bag valve mask ventilation bedside , advance airway management tool ( intubation equipment , etc ) immediately available . After time-out , propofol administration begin . The study drug administer properly train administer compliance healthcare licensure requirement . Propofol administer 0.5mg/kg ( concentration 10mg/mL , round near 0.5mL ) initial bolus , follow repeat 0.25mg/kg bolus ( round ) every three five minute need maintain Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) target -2 ( `` light sedation - awakens voice &lt; 10 second '' ) RASS target -3 ( `` moderate sedation - movement eye open without eye contact '' ) 15 minute . No 1.5mg/kg propofol administered time period . After sedation session complete , patient allow wake monitored ED least another hour prior discharge . If patient experience adverse safety event determination treat provider make unsafe continue give propofol , protocol terminate immediately . Numeric pain score ( 0-10 ) obtain prior medication administration , 30 minute 60 minute final dose medication . Patients also question associated migraine symptom ( nausea/vomiting/photophobia/phonophobia ) resolution . Patients receive follow-up phone call 24 hour assess pain score , need additional medication whether would opt treatment event another severe headache . Patient chart subsequently review determine ED visit within 72 hour propofol administration .</detailed_description>
