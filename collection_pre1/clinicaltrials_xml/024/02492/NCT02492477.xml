	<brief_summary>The benefit risk flush flush non-used PORT-A-CATH® cancer patient time interval eventual PORT-A-CATH® flushing currently unknown . The manufacturer PORT-A-CATH® recommend regular flushings every 4 week . In clinical practice , interval usually least three month . Regular flushing might lead decrease risk PORT-A-CATH® thrombosis , may also lead increased infection thrombosis rate patient discomfort .

	<detailed_description>Currently unknown flush non-used PORT-A-CATH® every 4 week valid strategy preserve functioning . Even , decision keep PORT-A-CATH® completion adjuvant therapy base profound patient information exist hardly data regard PORT-A-CATH® related complication non-used PORT-A-CATH® . The propose prospective , two arm trial aim investigate flush non-used PORT-A-CATH® period one year equal PORT-A-CATH® related complication compare flush PORT-A-CATH® every 4 week . The propose trial also aim examine frequency PORT-A-CATH® related complication non-used PORT-A-CATH® . The author put hypothesis few port-a-cath related infection experimental arm compare infection rate mention literature 27 % , since puncture PORT-A-CATH® administration fluid main cause infection .</detailed_description>
