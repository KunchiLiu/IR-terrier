	<brief_summary>Objectives : To compare prevalence clinical symptom stomach problem patient progressive discontinuation ( one week esomeprazole , 20mg , discontinuation ) sudden discontinuation esomeprazole 40mg . The presence clinical symptom , report modified-Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test ( PASS ) test weekly assess 4 week inclusion . Study design : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 156 patient treat esomeprazole 40mg since 4 week , randomize 1 week placebo one week esomeprazole 20mg . The first day study ( Day 0 ) , three blood sample collect fast measure chromogranine A ( CgA ) , gastrinemia , Helicobacter Pilory ( HP ) serology . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C19 activity assess . Then , Day 1 , patient receive esomeprazole 20mg placebo 7 day ( Day1-8 ) . Participants complete PASS test week weekday throughout study ( Day8-D15-D22-D29 ) , telephone interview consultation , schedule clinical follow study . Duration treatment : Esomeprazole placebo one week ( Day1-8 ) Omeprazole single dose ( Day0 ) Time plan research Duration patient : The treatment stop 7 day . The questionnaire collect 4th week , Day29 . Overall duration inclusion : one year Maximal overall duration study : 365 days+29 days=394 day Maximal delay communication result : 2 year</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>** Objectives Primary objective : To compare prevalence clinical symptom acid rebound , patient progressive sudden discontinuation Proton pump inhibitor . The presence clinical symptom , describe first question Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test primary end-point , assess 4 week inclusion . Secondary objective : To compare prevalence clinical symptom acid rebound patient progressive sudden discontinuation Proton pump inhibitor 1,2 3 week . To compare consequence clinical symptom use modified-Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test patient progressive sudden discontinuation Proton pump inhibitor 1,2,3 4 week . To evaluate relationship P-gastrin , Chromogranine A , Helicobacter pilory clinical symptom score . **Study design Overall description : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 156 patient treat esomeprazole 40mg since almost 4 week , withdrawal decide randomize 1 week placebo 1 week esomeprazole 20mg . Patients recruited hospitalization time clinician decides withdraw esomeprazole . A first interview clinician take place inform patient protocol , day clinical decision . A write information give another interview take place day inclusion case agreement . Then , first day study ( Day0 ) , three blood sample collect fast measure Chromogranine A , gastrinemia , Helicobacter Pilory serology . Then , patient receive dose 40mg ( CYP2C19 activity ) order assess CYP2C19 activity capillary concentration two hour later . Then , Day1 , patient receive esomeprazole 20mg placebo 7 day ( Day1-8 ) . Participants complete modified-Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test week weekday throughout study ( Day8-15-22-29 ) , telephone interview consultation , schedule clinical follow study . **Primary secondary end-points Primary outcome : The clinical significance rebound acid symptom define presence almost one clinical symptom . 1 . Stomach pain discomfort , 2 . Heartburn ( burn feel rise stomach low chest towards neck burn feeling locate behind breastbone may may rise chest ) ; 3 . Sour taste mouth/acid regurgitation ( feel regurgitation unpleasant feeling move upwards mouth ) ; 4 . Excessive burping/belching ( pass gas mouth ) ; 5 . Increased abdominal bloating ( feel abdominal distension fullness ) ; 6 . Nausea ( sensation need vomit ) ; 7 . Early satiety ( feel full eat able finish meal ) '' These symptom describe Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test , initially deign assess resolution gastroesophageal reflux disease-symptoms follow introduction Proton Pump Inhibitors . This test slightly modify measure outcome study . Secondary outcome measure : - The consequence Rebound acid symptom , use question Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test test accord presence clinical symptom - CYP2C19 activity - Gastrin Chromogranin A . - Helicobacter pilory serology - Study population Inclusion criterion : Treatment esomeprazole 40mg since 4 week . Esomeprazole withdrawal decide clinician . Male female age 18 year Volunteers participate study Must understand read French language Must able give write informed consent . Non-inclusion criterion : Impairment cognitive status Current indication continue Proton pump inhibitor treatment : - history erosive ulcerative esophagitis , Barrett esophagus , Zollinger-Ellison syndrome - Short-term treatment document ulcer disease , part combination regimen Helicobacter pylori eradication - Prevention ulcer due non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug . Hepatic impairment ( TP &lt; 60 % ) Hypersensitivity omeprazole ( CYP2C19 activity ) esomeprazole Current pregnancy current breastfeeding Withdrawal criterion : The different procedure withdrawal study : For patient randomize - Discontinuation study due intolerance adverse drug reaction . For patient - Evidence active gastrointestinal bleeding inclusion study ; - Right withdrawal study without justification ; Patient lose follow-up consider clinical symptom acid rebound . **Selection recruitment procedures - Identification eligible patient , hospitalized Service de medicine interne et de réhabilitation Clinique romande de réhabilitation : Only patient receive 40 mg / d. esomeprazole PO withdrawal Proton pump inhibitor decide clinician , consider . - Oral Presentation study write information day withdrawal decide . Verification inclusion non-inclusion criterion . - Signature Consent inclusion least 5 hour first information , patient agrees participate .</detailed_description>
