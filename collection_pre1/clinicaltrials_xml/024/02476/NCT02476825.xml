	<brief_title>A Bronchoscopy Study Assess Effects Inhaled Corticosteroids Adult Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single-blind , control , single centre bronchoscopy study design assess effect fluticasone propionate airway gene expression cellularity healthy adult control without asthma . This study allow accurate assessment change gene/protein expression cellularity drive severe treatment-resistant asthma allow effect due corticosteroid rather disease consider . This improved mechanistic understanding important identify novel therapeutic target severe asthma , support development novel therapeutic . The primary endpoint corticosteroid-inducible gene expression pattern healthy airway . Approximately 30 healthy adult subject ( age 18-65 ) randomise 2:1 ratio one two study group : ) patient receive fluticasone propionate 500 mcg b.i.d . via Accuhaler 4 week ( n=20 ) , ii ) patient receive treatment 4 week ( n=10 ) . Bronchoscopy perform patient baseline , prior start treatment period end week 4 . The PI , Genentech Leicester laboratory support staff blind treatment allocation . A control arm include assess repeatability plan analysis , stability gene expression profile measure study period , provide comparator treatment group . Written inform consent participation study must obtain perform study-specific test evaluation . Consent obtain screen visit . At screening , important co-morbidities exclude . Patients also randomise screen visit . To ensure sufficient data analysis , subject withdraws completion study , replace another subject .</detailed_description>
