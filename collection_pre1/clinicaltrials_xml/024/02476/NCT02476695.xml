	<brief_title>FibroTouch Non-invasive Evaluation Liver Fibrosis Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The liver diseases frequently occur China . For various reason , chronic liver disease control time , develop gradually liver fibrosis cirrhosis . Without effective treatment , advance liver cirrhosis seriously influence quality patient ' life , place intolerable burden family society . At present , scholar generally think liver fibrosis early stage reversible . Therefore , liver fibrosis patient chronic liver diseases accurately evaluate early stage treat time , stop progress disease reduce occurrence liver cirrhosis liver cancer . For many year , liver biopsy still `` golden standard '' diagnosis liver inflammation fibrosis . However , invasiveness , potential risk complication , liver biopsy limited clinical application due poor acceptability repeatability . In recent year , liver fibrosis directly accurately diagnose via various diagnostic model use serological biomarkers ( e.g . FIBROTEST APRI ) medical imaging technology ( e.g . ultrasonic B , CT MRI ) . Transient elastography new technology field ultrasonic imaging . Liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) base relationship speed spread acoustic wave tissue stiffness tissue . It utilize specific probe send control low-frequency shear wave , wave signal transmit liver tissue , high-frequency signal track transmit process shear wave liver value liver stiffness ( kPa ) quickly calculate reference built-in liver histological model , provide quantitative standard diagnosis liver fibrosis chronic liver disease . The big LSM value mean fast transmission shear wave , harder determine liver tissue . As state `` 12th Five-year Plan Medical Device Technological Industry '' ( Ministry Science Technology ) , China greatly support research development new medical device promote application Chinese transient elastography system , FibroTouch , R &amp; D Tsing-Hua University independently new algorithm . FibroTouch rapidly determine LSM non-invasive way provide useful information liver fibrosis steatosis staging . Due FibroTouch new transient elastography system marketing , much study correlation FibroTouch liver biopsy diagnosis liver fibrosis cirrhosis . The goal prospective multicenter study determine diagnostic performance ( accuracy , specificity sensitivity ) FibroTouch liver fibrosis assessment chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patient use ROC analysis , liver biopsy reference . Approximately 600 patient enrol guarantee 500 final statistical case ; ≥100 case require fibrosis stage S0/1 , S2 , S3 S4 ( compensatory stage cirrhosis ) , respectively . For stage , case assign equally possible .</detailed_description>
