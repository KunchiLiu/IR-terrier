	<brief_title>Add-on Mirabegron Pediatric Patients With Refractory Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) highly prevalent disorder pediatric population . This condition comprise many urinary symptom , urgency , increase daytime frequency micturition , urge incontinence nocturia . These symptom especially troublesome pediatric patient family since cause embarrassment limit everyday activity impair child 's development . Furthermore , serious complication see condition treat properly , urinary tract infection , vesico-ureteral reflux dysfunctional voiding . Antimuscarinic agent current pharmacologic mainstay OAB . Many side effect report clinical use antimuscarinics . Oxybutynin widely antimuscarinic agent use pediatric population molecule approve Health Canada child OAB . However , patient suboptimal response antimuscarinic many experience side effect . Children OAB therefore represent disease population need alternative effective , safe well-tolerated therapy help manage overactive detrusor , reduce prevent incontinence . Mirabegron , β3-adrenoceptor ( β3-AR ) agonist approve treatment OAB symptom adult population , first new class compound different mechanism action . The recommended starting dose mirabegron 25mg , increase 50mg , base individual efficacy tolerability . Side effect commonly report antimuscarinics observe often mirabegron placebo ( headache 2.0 % , dry mouth 2.0 % , constipation 1.6 % ) . Several Phase II III study show significant improvement clinical OAB symptom adult treat mirabegron favorable tolerability profile . Mirabegron study yet pediatric patient recommendation regard use issue manufacturer medical regulatory body . A prospective open-label study , use adjusted-dose regimen mirabegron ( 25-50mg ) add exist antimuscanic treatment ( dual treatment ) , include pediatric patient refractory urinary incontinence due OAB . This protocol approve investigator ' research ethic board . Patients without symptom improvement partial response intensive behavioural protocol medical therapy ( least 2 different antimuscarinic agent ) recruit . Pprimary end-point efficacy toward urinary continence secondary end-points tolerability safety . The patients/parents satisfaction also record . After 8 12 week new medication , possibility up-titration assess . Patients parent question compliance , tolerability efficacy . If patient take medication ≥80 % time , significant side effect still significant OAB symptom , investigator offer dose increase ( Mirabegron 50mg daily ) . If accept , medication provide instruction report new side effect . Subjects complete 3-day voiding diary prior medical visit ass efficacy treatment urotherapy . Visits do every 3 month .</detailed_description>
