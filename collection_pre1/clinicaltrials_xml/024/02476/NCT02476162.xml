	<brief_summary>Second malignant neoplasm cardiac late effect primary driver serious non-recurrence morbidity mortality long term childhood cancer survivor . Cardiac late effect prominently associate exposure high dos anthracyclines chest radiation . While increased recognition late effect result risk-targeted therapy reduction use high dose radiation anthracyclines many patient , cardiotoxic exposure continue essential component curative childhood cancer therapy . In addition , survivor age increasingly susceptible general risk factor cardiovascular disease recognize general population , hypertension , obesity , dyslipidemia , diabetes . This study evaluate high blood pressure monitor ( HBPM ) -based intervention early detection pre-hypertension prevention clinical hypertension survivor childhood cancer . Eligible consent participant randomize one three group : GROUP 1 : Instructed measure blood pressure ( BP ) every day 3 month . GROUP 2 : Instructed measure BP 7 consecutive day month , 3 month . GROUP 3 : Instructed measure blood pressure 3 consecutive day month , 3 month . The randomization group do use sequential assignment newly recruit participant base randomly ordered list . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - Evaluate feasibility High Blood Pressure Monitoring ( HBPM ) three consecutive month use remote blood pressure device provide participant St. Jude Lifetime cohort ( SJLIFE ) protocol . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Assess compliance use HBPM measurement frequency , evaluate overall defined minimum use three different group . - Assess compliance use HBPM cell phone status , evaluate without personal cell phone capable connect directly home blood pressure monitoring device via Wi-Fi Bluetooth network .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research test do study include : 1 . Screening evaluation consent - Individuals ask question help investigator determine eligible participate . This include question medical history pertain blood pressure , medicine , certain medical condition , individual willing use technology provide study . For individual eligible participate , opportunity provide discus study complete consent process . 2 . Group assignment randomization - Participants randomly assign one three group : study team member select one sixty identical envelope , contain group assignment , 20 envelope contain three group assignment . This random group assignment determine frequency participant monitor blood pressure home . The randomization three different group help investigator determine often survivor consistently monitor blood pressure . 3 . Educational session - After participant assign group , instruct set use home blood pressure monitoring device . 4 . Monitoring blood pressure home - Participants ask monitor blood pressure home morning even use remote monitoring device three-month period . Frequency monitor depend random group assignment . The device iHealth Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor wireless blood pressure monitoring device fit snugly around one arm automatically measure record blood pressure one minute . The device pair participant 's smart phone study-provided iPod Touch , use operate device save blood pressure reading . After completion three-month monitoring period , participant ask return device ( iPod Touch , applicable ) . 5 . Reminders use device - Participants start monitor blood pressure return home completion St. Jude visit . During educational session , participant ask set reminder smart phone study-provided iPod Touch alert monitor blood pressure . Depending often assign monitor blood pressure , may also receive email and/or text reminder prompt monitor blood pressure . In addition , study team member may contact three measurement 140/90 mm Hg , read consider hypertensive . A study team member may contact participant monitor specify group assignment attempt troubleshoot barrier and/or technical issue .</detailed_description>
