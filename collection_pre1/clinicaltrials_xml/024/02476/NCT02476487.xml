	<brief_summary>Background : Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia ( SAB ) frequently encounter hospital , high rate morbidity mortality . Duration antimicrobial treatment SAB , case Infective endocarditis ( IE ) , recommend different guideline relies risk stratification relapse infection rather definite diagnosis septic focus eventually determine relapse rate . In recently publish study fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET CT find sensitive imaging test identify metastatic infectious focus Gram-positive bacteremia , include SAB . Objectives : To examine impact use FDG PET CT diagnostic algorithm non-IE SAB compare standard treatment recommendation treatment duration clinical outcome . Methods : A prospective interventional non-comparative cohort study conduct Rambam Health Care Campus . Patients SAB , define microbiologically clinically , undergo FDG PET CT 10-14 day follow first positive blood culture diagnosis septic extra-cardiac focus infection . Patients IE exclude . Short ( 2 week ) versus long treatment ( 4-6 week ) recommend negative positive PET CT test , respectively . Patients followed-up 1 year relapse infection mortality . We document sensitivity specificity PET CT detection complication among patient SAB . We examine percentage patient use PET CT change treatment duration compare standard recommendation . We compare also , relapse rate 1 year mortality rate data previous study local data . Assuming 15 % rate management change compare consensus recommendation , sample 150 patient achieve require 95 % CI . Significance : Our trial serve improve decision make patient non-IE SAB , shorten treatment duration unnecessary case decrease relapse rate give prolonged appropriate treatment metastatic infection identify standard management algorithm . PET CT assume increasingly important role infection diagnosis management . The current study first examine role PET CT direct management patient SAB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Since show PET CT sensitive modality detect complication Gram-positive bacteremia , mainly S. aureus , seek examine diagnostic algorithm SAB use PET CT . Specifically , plan examine : 1 . In patient fulfil current criterion short course antibiotic treatment SAB , patient receive long treatment due presence undetected foci infection PET CT ? 2 . In patient risk factor mandate prolonged antibiotic treatment accord current guideline ( without IE ) negative PET CT , treatment discontinuation two week treatment safe ? 3 . For patient primary bacteremia , PET CT improve outcome ( relapse , length stay ( LOS ) , survival ) ? Study design : A prospective , interventional , non-comparative cohort study Setting location : Rambam Health Care Campus , primary tertiary 900-bed university-affiliated hospital . Treatment algorithm : All patient manage use uniform diagnostic/ treatment algorithm , supervise infectious disease consultant . Patients classify two group ( table 1 ) : Group 1- patient fulfil criterion complicate bacteremia Group 2- patient uncomplicated bacteremia PET CT perform day 7-14 since first positive blood culture . If finding suggestive infection demonstrate FDG-PET imaging , treat clinician consider finding , consultation PET-expert radiologist infectious disease consultant . If infection consider likely , clinician may consider attempt obtain tissue specimen order confirm suspicion . 1 . Patients fulfil current criterion short course antibiotic treatment : treatment prolong PET CT demonstrate focus residual infection . 2 . Patients risk factor mandate prolonged antibiotic treatment accord current guideline without IE : antibiotic stop 2 week PET CT normal . Participant recruitment data collection : Patients identify daily report S. aureus growth blood culture . The researcher apply inclusion exclusion criterion preliminary cohort . All patient fulfil inclusion criterion provide informed consent consecutively enrol . Patients follow clinical consultation discharge . Post-discharge patient followed-up 1 year end treatment telephone interview clinical consultation re-admitted hospital . Diagnostic test : Imaging Protocols : FDG-PET/CT perform 60-90 min radiopharmaceutical injection skull half thigh . Oral contrast give uptake time . Analysis PET/CT image include : 1 . Visual inspection exclude misregistration PET CT component . 2 . Visual inspection image semiquantitative evaluation maximum standardize uptake value ( SUVmax ) evaluation . 3 . Localizing focus abnormal radioactivity accumulation indicate infection . Analysis : The percentage management change trigger PET CT document per patient group . To refute null hypothesis , i.e . difference patient management without PET CT , define low limit 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) percentage management change &gt; 10 % . Assuming 15 % rate management change , sample 150 achieve require 95 % CI . If percentage 20 % , need 60 patient . The number patient include depend percentage management change monitor every 10 patient . We compare outcomes document study cohort report literature .</detailed_description>
