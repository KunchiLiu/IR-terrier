	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterize multitude symptom . Impairments balance , muscle deficit increase risk fall commonly experience PD.The purpose study investigate effect two different resistance training program improve balance muscular strength thereby reduce risk fall PD . This study randomize individual one two group , power training group , strength training group . Both interventional group participate 12 week resistance training , two time per week hour exercise session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disorder result multiple hallmark symptom , balance impairment , postural instability muscular deficit . These symptom , combination deficient sensory-perceptual integration system , put individual PD high risk fall fracture , compare healthy old adult . With expect rise PD diagnosis , place unprecedented burden Canadian healthcare system due increase hospitalization , surgery , placement long term care facility , rehabilitation . Improving symptom severity delay disease progression rehabilitation strategy improve balance muscular deficit , decrease fall risk individual PD , potentially alleviate project burden healthcare system . For reason imperative ability directly measure degree individual PD risk experience fall objective technique . Purpose : Therefore purpose study examine effect two different form resistance training ( RT ) improve muscular deficit experience , well improve balance impairment experience suggest RT able healthy old adult PD well . The two RT program investigate conventional strength training ( ST ) program high velocity strength training , know power training ( PT ) program . Objective/Aim : The objective study identify ST PT effective rehabilitation program improve muscle strength power , balance measure reduce risk fall . Due nature PT intervention hypothesize individual experience great improvement outcome measure . Methods/Design : This study double blind randomize control trial . Participants blind group allocation except control group , however interventional group inform participate RT program . The primary investigator collect measure consider objective follow time point . Pre-intervention measure collect prior randomization group allocation . The assessor disease severity also blind group allocation . Participants randomize one three group : ) control group ( account normal disease progression duration intervention ) ; ii ) ST group iii ) PT group . The intervention total 12 week long , participant come two day per week hour long session day , total 24 session . Participants randomize ST group complete three set 8-10 repetition 70 % one repetition maximum ( 1-RM ) , determine pre-test . Those randomized PT group complete three set 12-15 repetition 40 % 1-RM , determined pre-test . Both program involve individualize exercise prescription base result predict 1-RM . This program design Canadian Society Exercise Physiology Certified Exercise Physiologist , knowledge ability safely test prescribe exercise individual chronic condition . Both program progressive nature , individual able complete last set , two consecutive training session higher end range repetition ( i.e . ST group 10 repetition ) , next session weight increase 5 % . Upon completion participant complete outcome measure . These measure complete wash period 3 month 6 month post intervention investigate potential long term effect rehabilitation program , either advantageous long term .</detailed_description>
