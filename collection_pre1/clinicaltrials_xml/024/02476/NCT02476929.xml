	<brief_summary>Introduction : Rhinitis , sinonasal polyposis ( SP ) asthma disease whose pathogenesis base inflammation . This determine presence disease , evolution treatment . It therefore important develop validate methodology allow u noninvasively detect inflammation airway . Thus , exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) study important non-invasive marker inflammation lower airway , nasal nitric oxide ( nNO ) may good marker nasal inflammation . Furthermore , electronic nose electronic nanosensor device capable detect specific volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) use non-invasive biomarker biochemical process different disease whose pathophysiology also base inflammation . Objective : To determine reference value nNO different pattern VOCs healthy individual , individual allergic rhinitis ( AR ) non-allergic rhinitis individual SP asthma . Methodology : Prospective , control study . Four group include : Healthy subject , patient AR , non-allergic rhinitis patient SP asthma ( n=252 ) . Prick-test pneumoallergens perform . Determination FeNO , nNO , lung function test , measurement VOCs electronic nose blood sample take . Bilateral nasal endoscopy sample collection use technique brush mucosa placement filter paper , study nasal cytology mediator inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assessment nasal bronchial inflammation : Rhinitis ( allergic non-allergic ) , SP asthma disease characterized process whose pathogenesis base inflammation . Inflammation airways assess directly indirectly . The technique assess inflammation directly divide invasive technique non-invasive technique . Within invasive technique include require nasal bronchial endoscopy biopsy . However , applicability invasive method many limitation without risk and/or complication . They also require considerable experience implement . It therefore important develop validate new method allow u non-invasively detect inflammation upper low airway . Nitrous oxide ( NO ) : Is synthesize amino acid L-arginine action enzyme nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) . Three isoforms enzyme know : nNOS NOS1 , predominate nervous tissue ; iNOS , inducible NOS NOS2 , induce agent activates immune system ; eNOS , endothelial NOS NOS3 , constituent vascular endothelium . Since iNOS find different cell respiratory tract induce various inflammatory cytokine , NO consider excellent marker airway inflammation . Thus , exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) consider good non-invasive marker inflammation lower airway , nasal nitric oxide ( nNO ) potentially appear good marker nasal inflammation . Nasal nitric oxide ( nNO ) : Some author describe reference value nNO one hundred time higher FeNO . However , normal level nNO different nasal diseases healthy individual establish publish result vary widely . Dotsch et al . 1996 publish series 67 healthy subject find mean nNO value healthy population 96±47 ppb . A year later Ferguson study 82 healthy patient publish mean normal value nNO 1197±361 ppb . Additional paper publish subsequently , result remain quite diverse . As reference value patient rhinitis , data publish far also contradictory . Some author show nNO high patient diagnose rhinitis , especially patient AR . However , study observe difference level nNO patient diagnose rhinitis compare normal population . The electronic nose : Is new technique base detection VOCs present gas phase human respiration detect chromatography mass spectrometry sensor . It consist device make several nanosensors expose volatile particle undergo specific change electrical resistance , result pattern profile VOCs logarithmic regression . These VOC pattern use non-invasive biomarkers several biochemical process occur different disease whose pathogenesis base inflammation . For example , diseases airway use successfully compare pattern VOCs patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma . This technique 's potential applicability biomedicine enormous . In short , measure nNO determine pattern VOCs electronic nose non-invasive method help diagnosis monitoring certain respiratory disease . However , case nNO currently available study show different conflict result case determination VOCs electronic nose paper publish date . It therefore vital design study allow u clarify potential utility non-invasive marker inflammation determination nNO determination different pattern VOCs electronic nose healthy patient , patient diagnose AR non-allergic rhinitis patient associate SP asthma . Working Hypothesis : Rhinitis , SP asthma prevalent disease cause considerable morbidity . Since substrate disease lie inflammation , group investigator believe study inflammation one interesting aspects assessment management disease . Similarly measure FeNO use good marker bronchial inflammation , measure nNO determine pattern VOCs electronic nose could also two good non-invasive marker upper and/or low ( case VOCs ) airway inflammation . However , although recent year study origin , function utility measure nNO use electronic nose respiratory disease , still many question remain reference two technique .</detailed_description>
