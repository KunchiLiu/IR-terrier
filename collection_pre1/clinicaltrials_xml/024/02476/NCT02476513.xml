	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate participant clinical feature associate increase risk esophageal disorders.The investigator also see positive association esophageal disorder men,40-60 without abdominal obesity diagnosis follow disease ; Gastroesophageal reflux disease , Barrett Esophagus Esophageal Adenocarcinoma . The investigator hypothesize obese patient refer Esophagogastroduodenoscopy exhibit esophageal disorder . Since currently rate obesity adenocarcinoma esophagus increase significantly past 15 year , investigator hope find biochemical marker ( i.e . pro-inflammatory mediator ) esophagus . The investigator hope sample lead u differential expression molecular marker inflammatory mediator vary degree esophageal disorder</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Molecular Assessment Men With High Risk Esophageal Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients elevated central adiposity increase risk esophageal disorder ; correlate central adiposity advance esophageal pathology ( BE EAC ) . This do comparing body mass fat distribution tissue abnormality find pathology review EGD biopsy . It anticipate group men study increase likelihood histopathologic alteration , fit scale ( 0-no inflammation , 1-inflammation BE , 2-BE dysplasia , 3-carcinoma ) accord referral pattern UAB 's outpatient gastroenterology clinic . At molecular level , also relationship pro-inflammatory cytokine obesity , may contribute esophageal disorder [ 28 ] . Metabolically active fat cell secrete cytokine exclusive adipose tissue ( adipokines , leptin/adiponectin ) well classic signal molecule , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-Î± ) ; interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 ; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) ; macrophage inflammatory protein 1 ( MIP 1 ) [ 29-33 ] . Obesity-triggered pro-inflammatory molecule may promote tissue injury , lead metaplasia dysplasia BE , subsequently , carcinoma . Thus , measure pro-inflammatory marker prospective patient population , determine patient elevated level exhibit pathologic disorder esophagus differential expression molecular marker correlate degree esophageal disorder . We analyze sample collect men adipocytokines inflammatory mediator release tissue injury . Additionally , examine molecular marker correlate advanced esophageal disorder ( BE high grade dysplasia EAC ) . Persistent stimulation need cause stepwise progression early stage esophageal injury , BE , carcinoma . Since molecular event lead transformation know , goal profile biopsy tissue collect prospective cohort 60 men , analyze IHC p53 , Ki67 , cyclin D1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , Cox-2 , DKK-1 , CD44 , leptin , adiponectin . These molecule know involved transformation normal esophageal epithelium EACs via progression metaplasia BE low-grade dysplasia high-grade dysplasia . [ 34 ] . The clinical outcome measurement correlate level molecule , determine IHC , metaplasia , degree dysplasia BE , stage EAC . For BE tissue , correlation extent p53 stain aggressive clinical feature . Our preliminary finding six BEs , select patient population UAB , indicate high proportion p53 stain directly correlate high-grade lesion</detailed_description>
