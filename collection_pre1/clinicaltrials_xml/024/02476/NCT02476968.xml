	<brief_summary>This prospective , open-label , single arm , multi-center study ass real world clinical effectiveness safety olaparib maintenance monotherapy capsule formulation ( line EU approve prescribe information ) conduct platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patient ( include patient primary peritoneal / fallopian tube cancer ) carry germline somatic BRCA mutation ( document mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious [ know predicted detrimental/lead loss function ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Assess Efficacy Safety Olaparib Maintenance Monotherapy Treatment Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study recruit approximately 250 patient sBRCAm disease gBRCAm disease , aim accrue minimum 50 patient sBRCAm disease . Patients unknown germline BRCA mutate status gBRCAwt disease previously identify BRCAm disease tumour test consider screen undergo , upon inform consent signature , central tumor blood test determine BRCA mutation status . In addition central BRCA testing , patient screen study unknown BRCA status know gBRCAwt status , adequate archival tumour tissue sample available , test qualify HRR gene alteration . Patients confirm carry deleterious suspect deleterious BRCA-independent genetic alteration 13 gene involve Homologous Recombination Repair ( HRR ) pathway ( HRRm cohort ) allow additional exploratory cohort ( HRRm cohort ) . It expect approximately 25 patient include HRRm cohort target number 250 patient BRCAm disease reach . Patients assign olaparib capsule orally 400 mg twice daily . They initiate olaparib treatment within 8 week last dose platinum-containing chemotherapy ( last dose day last infusion ) assess every 4 week whilst treatment . All patient clinical objective radiological tumour assessment accord modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 guideline baseline every 12 week relative date enrolment , objective radiological disease progression determine investigator . Patients could continue receive olaparib long determine investigator , objective radiological disease progression long investigator 's opinion benefiting treatment relation clinical assessment meet discontinuation criterion . Once patient discontinue olaparib manage per local clinical practice remain study data collect subsequent treatment , progression , overall survival safety . For exploratory analysis purpose , patient ask provide consent : 1 . Optional tumour sample baseline disease progression 2 . An optional blood sample patient confirm sBRCAm HRRm disease</detailed_description>
