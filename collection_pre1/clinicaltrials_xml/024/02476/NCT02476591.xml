	<brief_title>Charge Transparency Critical Care Practice Its Effects Overall Cost Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ordering provider include resident , fellow attend physician , well mid level provider Nurse Practitioners ( NP 's ) Physician Assistants ( PA 's ) . The investigator develop dashboard display daily cumulative charge relate laboratory , pharmacy , radiology , service patient admit Vanderbilt ICU 's . Using dashboard ICU order provider able see total daily charge previous 24 hour , also sum charge patient 's current ICU admission . In addition , `` snapshot '' overview tab available patient display day day trend overall charge ICU stay patient , top 5 expensive lab/radiology/pharmacy charge , previous 24 hour charge , total ICU number chest x-ray , Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , Basic Metabolic Panel ( BMP ) , Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , Arterial Blood Gas ( ABG ) charge patient . The order provider able query database dashboard information regard individual laboratory drug charge , well view trajectory total charge give patient . This dashboard allow unprecedented transparency regard cost care patient ICU . Patients identified dashboard Medical Record Number ( MRN ) , ICU bed , initial protect identity . AIM 1 : To evaluate effect introduce charge transparency order provider via charge dashboard associate printed synopsis average charge per patient per day Vanderbilt ICUs . We intend study effect charge transparency order provider average charge per patient per day conduct prospective , self-controlled unit , multiple cross-over trial . We divide study period four 12-week block two block `` charge transparency '' two block `` transparency . '' Each unit assign alternate block `` transparency '' `` transparency '' study unit schedule prevent cross contamination . For month access grant , order provider study ICU grant access ICU charge dashboard follow brief orientation . In addition password protect , unit specific iPad provide study unit . The iPad enable point care access patient specific snapshot information , well easily incorporate dashboard information clinical care . AIM 2 : To evaluate effect utilization charge dashboard order pattern provider cost containment Vanderbilt ICUs . In addition study effect charge transparency patient ICU charge , also intend study effect charge transparency resource utilization , namely routine laboratory radiology test . As surrogate marker routine laboratory utilization measure average number Comprehensive Blood Count ( CBC ) Basic Metabolic Panel ( BMP ) test per patient per day , surrogate marker routine radiology utilization use average number chest x-rays per patient per day .</detailed_description>
