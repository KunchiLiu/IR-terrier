	<brief_summary>Multiple neoadjuvant endocrine trial demonstrate woman good prognosis tumor identify . These trial also demonstrate adverse effect overall outcome woman treat neoadjuvant endocrine therapy several month prior definitive treatment . A new standard care need define elderly woman good prognosis estrogen receptor ( ER ) + tumor , since woman may benefit endocrine therapy alone treat cancer without compromise local distant control . The investigator hypothesize endocrine therapy alone provide adequate local systemic control breast cancer subpopulation woman 75 old ER+ breast cancer low Ki67 score .</brief_summary>
