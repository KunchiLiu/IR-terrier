	<brief_summary>The purpose study see investigational surgery transfer tissue non-living donor live individual help restore great function , appearance , sensation hand forearm area individual suffer traumatic injury hand forearm . This procedure call hand allotransplantation `` hand transplant '' . This study also collect data patient hand transplant nonliving donor . Recovery outcomes observe clinical exam , x-ray , blood tissue test , associate evaluation follow visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject select possible participant study s/he suffer traumatic amputation hand s/he identify s/he interested hand transplant alternative continue care use conventional prosthesis . Investigators evaluate subject age 18 60 miss tissue area hand forearm . After obtain consent , several pre-transplant screening procedure evaluation complete . This data utilized determine recipient eligibility selection placement onto transplant wait list . The data information gather pre-transplant screening procedure evaluate discussed member Participant Selection Committee ( PSC ) consensus reach nominate ( ) transplantation . All screening procedure re-evaluated yearly basis subject remain list . Transplant Waiting List Procedures After data evaluate , subject 's information present Patient Selection Committee final review . Some subject evaluate may NOT deem eligible protocol . While waitlist , serum sample provide every month perform cross-match current sample case potential donor candidate . Preparation Transplantation When match donor identify , screen procedure need repeat do prior hand transplant surgery , consistent standard care institution . Once subject clear surgery , transplant schedule perform . The duration surgery approximately 18-24 hour . The patient PICC ( peripherally insert central catheter ) line start limb operate . If patient bilateral transplant , central line place anesthesiologist . An infraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block use 0.25 % bupivacaine mepivacaine without epinephrine would perform recipient 's upper extremity indwell catheter intra post-operative pain control vasodilatation chemical sympathectomy . Cephalosporin 2 g equivalent give IV preoperatively . Post-transplant clinical monitoring procedure post-operative care The transplanted tissue monitor closely per hand surgeon 's standard free flap postoperative protocol . Additionally , free flap treatment guideline provide hospital supportive staff physical therapy , occupational therapy , nursing . Hospitalization length The subject 's expect length time hospital floor approximately 4 week . After subject move Rehabilitation Unit post operative day ( POD ) 90 If complication , subject may remain long . Occupational therapy The subject need occupational therapy twelve 24 month surgery . During immediate 90 day in-patient stay , patient hand therapy minimum five day week 1-3 hour session . At visit , series exercise aim improve strength active passive range motion perform additional modality add tolerate . Early control motion introduce reduce chance adhesion . Appropriate wound dressing splint would fashion aid proper positioning , heal safe exercising . The caregiver must also learn prescribed exercise proper use care equipment subject need use . Follow-up visit After subject discharge hospital , s/he least six follow-up visit within first year multi-disciplinary team . The subject least two visit yearly thereafter . The reconstructive surgeon , transplant surgeon , physicians subject 's doctor suggest see participant provide follow care office . Monitoring tests/procedures The subject undergo monitoring test number follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Candidates may male female patient age 18 60 miss part one hand forearm Must HIV negative time transplant Crossmatch negative donor recipient Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine test acceptable ) within 48 hour transplant agree use reliable contraception one year follow transplant Subjects must give write informed consent Subjects poor candidate prosthesis eligible hand transplant prosthesis failure non acceptance/poor satisfaction trial prosthesis Uncontrolled infection severe concomitant disease would exclude recipient transplantation Substance abuse disorder currently control ( determine Michigan Alcohol Screening Test ) Active severe psychiatric illness Psychosis Depression Body Dysmorphic disorder ( see Appendix K screen tool ) . Less severe psychiatric condition address case case basis Coexisting medical psychosocial problem relevant tissue allotransplantation : Positive serology HIV ; Hepatitis B/C Antigen Subjects cognitive deficit relate TBI ( traumatic brain injury ) organic neurological disorder Active malignancy within 5 year Unstable social situation evidence lack stable housing and/or lack supportive significant Cognitive limitation affect patient ability Recent history medical nonadherence Any psychological status would hinder success safety transplantation . Level amputation proximal midhumerus : presence proximal muscle require motor function hand Congenital Abnormalities : coexistent absence/atrophy/agenesis tissue may affect post transplant result History amputation less six month : subject must allow attempt prosthetic use prior hand transplantation . This waived case recipient require amputation/revision transplant site time transplantation . However , possible highly encouraged patient rule prosthetics alternative transplantation . Blindness : blind amputee may poor candidate sensory return hand may provide sufficient protective sensation Pregnancy</criteria>
