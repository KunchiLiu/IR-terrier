	<brief_summary>Patients present clinic outpatient set worsen heart failure represent unique opportunity novel approach decongestion ( remove fluid ) may rapidly improve fluid status symptom well reduce risk hospitalization . In patient le severe congestion ( fluid overload ) , combine vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan loop diuretic ( fluid pill like furosemide/bumetanide/torsemide ) may represent effective strategy decongestion . In addition , look patient ' copeptin level may help identify likely respond tolvaptan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolvaptan For Worsening Outpatient Heart Failure : Role Copeptin In Identifying Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double blind , positive control , multi-center clinical trial enrol patient present outpatient setting sign symptom consistent worsen congestive heart failure . The sample size study 40 patient . Candidates study identify screen outpatient present worsen heart failure . Patients qualify study enrol within 24 hour identification . Patients randomize 1:1 fashion one two treatment arm : - Augmentation current daily dose oral loop diuretic + 30 mg oral Tolvaptan daily - Augmentation current daily dose oral loop diuretic + placebo oral Tolvaptan daily Patients initiate study medication hospital set observed period time depend upon baseline serum sodium response study drug . In case patient observe 8 hour . Following observational period , patient leave hospital setting remainder study consist follow-up outpatient visit telephone . All patient Day 30 follow phone contact assessment vital status , adverse event morbidity period . The primary objective study compare effect oral tolvaptan plus augmented loop diuretic versus augment loop diuretic 1 ) short term change body weight without stratification baseline copeptin 2 ) index target sign symptoms congestion patient present worsen congestive heart failure outpatient set without prespecified post hoc stratification base baseline copeptin level .</detailed_description>
