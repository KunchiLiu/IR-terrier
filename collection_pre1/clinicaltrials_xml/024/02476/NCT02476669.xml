	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) endemic malignancy Southern China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore Malaysia . It highly associate Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . Radiation therapy alone indicate early stage I II disease concurrent chemoradiation require advanced stage III IVB diseases . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) standard radiation technique NPC , virtue superior target coverage dose spar adjacent critical organs-at-risks . Plasma EBV DNA novel plasma biomarkers extensively investigated NPC . Previous study prove predictive prognostic value NPC diagnosis , surveillance survival outcome . We would like investigate role plasma biomarkers include plasma EBV DNA treatment response evaluation , survival prognosis NPC , modern era precision radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serial Plasma EBV DNA Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients histologically confirm previously untreated NPC recruit join ti study . The study obtain approval local institutional review board . After write informed consent , baseline investigation include blood test routine hematology , biochemistry plasma EBV DNA take . Only 3ml EDTA blood take plasma EBV DNA potential biomarkers . They also undergo baseline imaging investigation include positron-emission tomography integrate computed tomography ( PET-CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head neck region . An routine nasoendoscopy nasopharyngeal biopsy obtain confirm delineate mucosal extent disease . If confirm non-metastatic , patient treat IMRT use 7-9 radiation beam . A total dose 70Gy 33-35 fraction 6.5 7 week give . For advanced stage III IVB diseases , concurrent chemoradiation use cisplatin 100mg/m2 Day 1 , 22 43 IMRT follow 3 cycle adjuvant chemotherapy cisplatin 80mg/m2 Day 1 5-FU 1000mg/m2 Day 1 Day 4 every 4 week 3 cycle start 4 week completion IMRT also give . Some patient also receive induction chemotherapy cisplatin100mg/m2 Day 1 5-FU 1000mg/m2 Day 1 5 , administer every 3 week 3 cycle commencement chemoradiation , discretion treat oncologist primary tumour close critical organ e.g . brainstem , optic chiasm optic nerve . After treatment patient undergo nasopharyngeal biopsy , patient undergo nasopharyngeal biopsy 8 week completion IMRT confirm histological complete local remission . Blood take day plasma EBV DNA potential biomarkers . Additional biopsy salvage local treatment e.g . brachytherapy , stereotactic IMRT boost offer patient persistent local disease 12 week completion IMRT . If complete local remission confirm , patient regular follow every 3 4 month surveillance survival outcome . Regular image MRI CT scan every 3 4 month also arrange well . Plasma EBV DNA measure 6 month 1 year completion IMRT clinically indicate afterwards . For metastatic disease , systemic chemotherapy ( platinum-based chemotherapy ) offer . Blood take plasma EBV DNA potential biomarkers baseline chemotherapy commencement every 3 cycle arrange . Imaging examination CT MRI scan arrange baseline 3-4 cycle chemotherapy tumour response evaluation . The trend baseline serial plasma EBV DNA potential biomarkers monitor prospectively .</detailed_description>
