	<detailed_description>This study examine relationship structural stability carotid atherosclerotic plaque form bifurcation common internal/external carotids ability lesion cause disease . The theory behind work hypothesis carotid atherosclerotic stroke present classical episodic clinical condition , may also involve element continuous process involve large small vessel circulation , microcirculatory change , cellular metabolic resistance ischemia micro embolic event . Recent study suggest every recognize clinical stroke , 5 silent stroke take place . The patient implication enormous image suggest 11 million `` silent stroke '' occur yearly US poor understanding pathophysiology cognitive consequence patient . Within framework , investigator choose study hypothesis carotid artery atherosclerosis likely cause microemboli , well classic macroemboli , may result subtle disturbance ordinarily detect obvious clinical event stroke transient ischemia attack . Understanding structural plaque abnormality render carotid plaque unstable risk embolization would help predict treat individual likely suffer classic episodic major stroke , also cognitive impairment contribution microemboli overall disease process . The investigator previously describe non-invasive ultrasound base measure plaque structural stability study proposal . This study expand previous work perform University Wisconsin-Madison , include patient carotid artery stenosis , without classic stroke symptom , well control group patient without know atherosclerotic disease . Patients recruited population patient schedule undergo carotid endarterectomy establish clinical indication . These indication include patient schedule carotid endarterectomy due presence high-grade atherosclerotic cervical internal carotid artery stenosis without clinical symptom , follow ACAS ( Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study ) NASCET criterion ( The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial ) ( carotid artery stenosis 60 % great without clinical symptom ; stenosis 70 % great clinical symptom ) . Patients recruit University Wisconsin Hospital Clinics Neurosurgery Clinic inpatient unit . With renewal investigator would like complete previously approve sample size 144 patient-subjects . In previous protocol 75 patients-subjects enrolled , remain 69 patient-subjects enrol study . The investigator also previously approve enrollment 50 control-subjects . Having enrol 20 previous protocol investigator complete enrollment enrol additional 30 control-subjects These control recruit patient-subjects . The investigator ask patient-subjects speak spouse family member see interested participating . If interest contact research team/study coordinator ( ) . In case , spouse family member accompany patient-subject , recruited time patient-subject . The Investigators demonstrate experience carotid endarterectomy asymptomatic symptomatic disease ( &gt; 25 per year ) high recruitment rate pilot study ( &gt; 95 % ) sufficient experience exist successful recruitment population time study . All patient undergo confirmation degree stenosis standard clinical methodology include angiography , magnetic resonance imaging , computerized tomographic angiography , and/or ultrasonic determination . Patients enrol study obtain health questionnaire highlight atherosclerotic risk factor , history atherosclerotic event involve organ , know history hyperlipidemia , smoking , hypertension , diabetes , cardiac disorder , family history . Results stratify accord risk factor . All patient undergo preoperative neuropsychological cognitive testing , ultrasound test atherosclerotic plaque determination elasticity strain , well TCD ( transcranial doppler ) measurement embolus , MRI test analysis MRI predictor cognition ischemic vascular disease per preliminary study , well blood collection . At time surgery , atherosclerotic plaque carotid bifurcation remove total examine histopathologically point point comparison ultrasonic strain measurement . These study gross ulceration , micro ulceration , formation thrombus platelet deposition , inflammatory cell neovascularity measure immunostaining marker microvascular endothelial presence . All study histopathologic evaluation obtain immediate preoperative period repeat one year post surgery determine CEA ( Carotid Endarterectomy ) durably stabilize vessel wall elasticity halt microemboli MRI cognitive decline . The study run 5 year IRB ( Institutional Review Board ) approval . Recruitment subject take place first three half year . All patient-subjects 1-year follow-up , MRI , ultrasound , TCD , blood collection cognitive study see endarterectomy affected pre-op change . Change cognition compare report study normal control group . In past , investigator recruit carotid patient great pace . Given complexity study investigator anticipate recruitment complete analysis 20 patients/year . During time initial psychological test do pre-operatively . During final year study , data analysis plaque ultrasound , MRI histopathology 1-year follow-up patient receive last year recruitment take place . Investigators recruit additional patient fill miss data point result identify subset classically asymptomatic patient significant carotid plaque microemboli cause vascular cognitive decline .</detailed_description>
