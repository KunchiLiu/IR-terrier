	<brief_summary>Desmoid tumor ( DT ) rare tumor ( 2-4 cases/million/year ) originate musculoaponeurotic structure . Although benign tumor metastatic potential , DT consider locally aggressive tumor , local invasiveness tissue destruction , lead pain , disability . Surgery remain keystone therapy , limited anatomical situation extra-abdominal desmoid ( EAD ) tumor ( chest wall , root member ) . In patient surgery consider , negative-margin resection ( R0 ) recommend , frequently result cosmetic/functional impairment . Moreover , prognostic impact R0 resection remain controversial . The outcome initial surgery depend upon several factor age , tumor site , tumor size demonstrate recent data French Sarcoma Group . Alternative therapy DT surgery front-line recurrence include NSAID 's , anti-estrogens alone combination , -interferon , chemotherapy , target therapy radiation therapy . All medical approach however may fail achieve long-term disease control number patient suffer irreducible pain , disability tumor volume . Cryoablation promise technique suitable patient experience extra-abdominal DT . The procedure base repeated cycle freezing/passive thaw tumor , lead cell death . The technique many advantage , among : accurate control iceball real-time MRI CT-scan monitoring ( possible technique radiofrequency ) , lack mutilation , possibility repeat procedure . The cryoablation procedure proven beneficial treatment various tumor ( liver metastasis , breast , kidney ) . Recently , percutaneous cryotherapy report treatment EAD tumor poorly suit surgery , promise result . In light encourage data , believe patient extra-abdominal DT amenable surgery unless unacceptable surgical sequel progress least two line adequate medical therapy ( tamoxifen , NSAID chemotherapy ) , could benefit cryoablation procedure . Tumor cryotherapy-induced regression allow symptom relief , prolong progression-free survival well quality life .</brief_summary>
