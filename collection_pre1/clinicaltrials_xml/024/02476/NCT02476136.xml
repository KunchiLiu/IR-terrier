	<brief_summary>Anxiety disorder common disorder , pose major burden society individual . An anxiety disorder may treat medication , particular antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) . However , much know antidepressant derive research depression rather anxiety . In recent year , researcher find antidepressant effective severely depressed patient patient milder symptom . It possible similar relationship symptom severity antidepressant efficacy exist anxiety disorder , currently little evidence available answer question . As antidepressant frequently prescribe patient mild moderate anxiety , clear understand effectiveness across severity range vital inform treatment decision . Therefore , purpose meta-analysis examine whether initial symptom severity affect antidepressant efficacy anxiety disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Severity Antidepressant Efficacy Anxiety Disorders : Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : The propose project individual patient data meta-analysis . The investigator collate data 29 randomize control trial second-generation antidepressant ( specifically : paroxetine , paroxetine control release ( CR ) , duloxetine , fluoxetine ) short-term treatment anxiety disorder , include total approximately 8,800 participant . The anxiety disorder include propose project generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , panic disorder ( PD ) . Generalized linear mixed model use investigate whether initial symptom severity relate antidepressant efficacy . Statistical analysis plan : A separate longitudinal analysis conduct disorder . For GAD , SAD , OCD , PTSD , linear mixed model use ; PD , generalize linear mixed model ( multilevel negative binomial regression ) use , dependent variable disorder ( number panic attack ) discrete count variable . Maximum likelihood estimation use estimation method linear mixed model , Laplace approximation use estimation method multilevel negative binomial regression PD . In model , measurement occasion represent level 1 , participant represent level 2 , trial represent level 3 . The effect measure interest change symptom baseline , except PD , effect measure interest total number panic attack per two week . The initial model build include fix effect interest , regardless significance . These include initial severity , treatment group covariates ( see ) . Linear quadratic term time ( day since baseline ) include . For participant , actual visit date use ( available ) rather intended weekly visit date . The following two- three-way interaction also include : severity x group , severity x linear time , group x linear time , severity x group x linear time , severity x quadratic time , group x quadratic time , severity x group x quadratic time . Using first model , variance-covariance structure nest data model include random effect . Random effect study , subject ( linear quadratic ) time , well various covariance structure ( unstructured , autocorrelated error , Toeplitz , etc . ) consider . Restricted maximum likelihood ( REML ) use estimation , best-fitting model select base upon Akaike Information Criterion ( AICc ) . In best-fitting model , backward selection maximum likelihood ( ML ) use select significant fix effect . Non-significant interaction term remove model ( unless three-way interaction group x severity x ( linear quadratic ) time significant , case two-way interaction main effect use variable retain ) . The best-fitting model select base upon Akaike Information Criterion ( AICc ) . Covariates : Models without follow covariates test : age , gender , duration illness ( available ) . Only main effect covariates include ; interaction variable include . Missing data : Baseline variable ( initial severity ) likely essentially complete , change score likely miss due dropout miss measurement occasion . The assumption make data miss random ( MAR ) , : missingness dependent variable may depend upon observed variable ( previous symptom score covariates ) , depend upon value unobserved ( miss ) variable . When MAR hold , mixed model yield unbiased estimate coefficient standard error even data miss , method handle miss data require .</detailed_description>
