	<brief_title>Evaluating Influence Externally vs. Internally Focused Exercise Rehabilitation Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease slow progress neurodegenerative movement disorder motor non-motor symptom . The gold standard medical pharmacotherapy ( levodopa ) lend relief symptom . However , non-motor symptom responsive therapy eventually become non-responsive , impaired proprioception ( sensory feedback limb provide awareness one 's body physical space ) . Although unclear levodopa unable relieve proprioception impairment , key underlie mechanism may responsible impaired sensorimotor integration ( combination sensory motor information brain utilized guide movement ) . This result corrupt input information proprioceptor brain ( muscle spindle golgi tendon organ ) , rather downstream integration information brain . With faulty signal area brain damage Parkinson 's disease ( basal ganglion ) , deficient sensorimotor integration impair patient ' ability rely sensory feedback movement . This subsequently impair ability automatize learn movement Parkinson 's disease cause previously automatic movement ( walk ) require conscious control ( lose automaticity ) . This problematic instance attention divert movement longer automatically control , engage conversation walking . Without attention movement , motor control break , lead heighten chance fall injury . However , Wulf Colleagues ( 2009 ) demonstrate individual Parkinson 's disease focus externally , great reliance sensorimotor integration foster , balance control improve compare individual focus attention internally . This suggest individual Parkinson 's disease may retain ability rely sensorimotor integration . Therefore , foster neuroplasticity basal ganglia utilization exercise , improve ability rely sensorimotor integration individual Parkinson 's disease ( use dual task training ) , automaticity movement may improve , subsequently decrease risk fall injury . Furthermore , improve sensorimotor integration , symptom severity might improve disease progression may slow . In addition provide improvement symptom Parkinson 's disease , provide great understanding pathophysiological mechanism underlie improvement associate exercise rehabilitation employ Parkinson 's disease . To date , goal-directed exercise yet investigate rudimentary aspect exercise , since study directly compare identical exercise regimens participant focus `` internally '' movement limb compare focus `` externally '' movement object manipulate . For reason , study investigate large magnitude gait balance training two group , one focus internally limb movement throughout exercise program , focus externally movement colour label attach limb . The gait , balance , stretch coordination exercise provide propose intervention two exercise group follow exact Parkinson 's disease Sensory Attention Focused Exercise ( PD-SAFEx™ ) protocol design Sage Almeida ( 2009 ) . PD-SAFEx™ group set intervention , lead primary investigator train conduct exercise protocol . The first half exercise class include walk exercise include large magnitude coordinate movement . All walk perform slowly . Walking exercise follow balance , stretch , coordination exercise sit , stand near , standard office chair , utilize latex Thera-bands® . To ensure balance coordination constantly challenge throughout intervention , exercise program progress week , increase difficulty . Sixty-five participant diagnose idiopathic Parkinson 's disease recruit . This present intervention study span 20- week period . Pre-assessments measure baseline symptom functionality conduct initial 2-week period prior start intervention . After pre-assessments conduct , participant randomize one three group : Group 1 : Internal Focus attention Exercise ( Original PD-SAFEx™ ) While perform exercise PD-SAFEx™ , participant instruct focus attention sensory feedback . This include focus participant ' attention stretch limb walking , straightness back sit , limb body orientation space coordinate movement , chest movement breathe exercise . Throughout exercise session , instructor volunteer constantly provide attention-directing instruction . Group 2 : External Focus attention Exercise ( Modified PD-SAFEx™ ) While perform exercise PD-SAFEx™ program , participant instruct focus attention towards movement colour label attach hand , elbow , knee foot . Group 3 : Control Group This group ask refrain change activity daily life throughout 20-week duration experiment ( pre-assessment washout ) . The exercise program follow pre-assessment baseline measure , last 12 week . Each exercise session last 60 minute , provide three time per week . Post-assessment outcome measure test prior intervention assess 2-week period immediately cessation exercise program . The washout period last 6 week ; thereafter assessment complete . Since present research study aim understand mechanism underlying rehabilitation , well ensure ecological validity , symptom severity ( UPDRS-III ) assess individual `` ON '' `` OFF '' state dopaminergic medication . Since individual `` ON '' state daily activity , exercise class perform `` ON '' dopaminergic medication state . If individual naïve dopaminergic medication ( De novo ) , assess ( `` OFF '' dopaminergic state ) . All individual include rehabilitation program require complete Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination ( ParMed X ) , sign physician prior join rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
