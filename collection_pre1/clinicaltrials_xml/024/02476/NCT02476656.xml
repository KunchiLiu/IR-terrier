	<brief_title>Placental Inflammation Prenatal Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate level inflammatory marker genetic indicator stress inflammation placenta umbilical cord blood pregnancy undergo group prenatal care compare traditional prenatal care . The investigator know woman receive group prenatal care fewer spontaneous preterm delivery . What know mechanism behind difference . By collect umbilical cord blood sample placentas 40 woman time delivery , investigator hope study expression stress-related gene level inflammatory marker maternal-fetal interface .</detailed_description>
