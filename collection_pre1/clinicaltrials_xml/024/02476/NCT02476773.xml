	<detailed_description>Double blind , randomize , control , dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial hookworm expose adult live area Americaninhas , Minas Gerais , Brazil . Subjects receive three dos assign vaccine deliver intramuscularly approximately Days 0 , 56 , 112 . Safety measure time study vaccination ( Day 0 ) 14 day study vaccination occurrence solicit injection site systemic reactogenicity event . Unsolicited non-serious adverse event ( AEs ) collect time first study vaccination approximately 1 month study vaccination . New-onset chronic medical condition Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) collect time first study vaccination approximately 9 month third study vaccination ( final visit ) . Clinical laboratory evaluation safety perform venous blood collect approximately 14 day vaccination . Immunogenicity test include IgG antibody responses vaccine antigen , indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) also ImmunoCAP , serum obtain prior study vaccination time point vaccination ; antibody affinity Surface Plasmon Resonance ; functional activity vaccine-induced antibody via vitro enzyme neutralization assay ; , antigen-specific memory B cell response . Recruitment enrollment study occur ongoing basis , group recruit vaccinated sequence . 60 subject enrol 6 group 10 .</detailed_description>
