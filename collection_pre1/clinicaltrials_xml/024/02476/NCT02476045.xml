	<brief_title>Panitumumab-based Maintenance Patients With RAS Wild-type , Metastatic Colorectal Cancer ( Valentino )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer administer accord individual situation , patient ' need , therapeutic precondition ( e.g . neurotoxicity follow adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ) , biomarkers aggressiveness disease . The OPTIMOX1 trial show equivalent duration disease control de-escalation / maintenance / reintroduction strategy compare treatment progression strategy oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy . Continuation `` lighten '' fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy bevacizumab represent standard care maintenance set . Panitumumab FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy represent standard care treatment RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer . The question whether maintenance strategy might apply also panitumumab combination chemotherapy unknown present . As continuation chemotherapy plus panitumumab disease progression foreseen hallmark `` PRIME '' trial , question whether de-escalation treatment intensity inferior respect result time tumor control , allow patient period less toxicity gain quality life . However , data available present regard optimal maintenance treatment anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) monoclonal antibody use association first-line chemotherapy . This open label , randomize , multicenter , phase II study compare efficacy , term non-inferiority progression-free survival ( PFS ) , maintenance panitumumab alone ( arm B ) compare panitumumab 5-FU/LV ( arm A ) follow induction treatment FOLFOX-4 panitumumab patient RAS wild-type , metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary endpoint : - Safety ( accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events -CTCAE- v 4.03 ) . All Adverse event report accord National Cancer Institute Criteria . The incidence adverse event summarize accord primary system-organ class ( SOC ) within category define CTCAE v4.03 . The summary overall ( severity grade 1-4 ) grade ≥3 event also report action take term treatment discontinuation . Similar summary make serious adverse event . The safety set consider . - Quality life ( patient report outcomes ) . - Response rate ( RR ) , duration response ( DR ) , time progression ( TTP ) , time treatment failure ( TTF ) overall survival ( OS ) . - Exploratory endpoint : Archival tumor tissue sample collect baseline . Samples send Pathology Department Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori exploratory biomarkers substudy A representative formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) diagnostic tumor specimen , tissue block must review pathologist confirm contain adequate tumor tissue . In alternative , fifteen 5-micron unstained slide allow . Next-generation sequencing ( Ion-Torrent ) in-situ hybridization technique perform identify potential biomarkers primary resistance . Since availability blood-based biomarkers could particularly useful prediction treatment efficacy acquire resistance panitumumab , study collect blood sample ( optional ) individual patient ( treatment , every 8 week treatment progression ) analyze circulate tumor DNA digital Polymerase chain reaction ( ddPCR ) next generation ( NGS ) approach . Moreover , pharmacogenetic study predict panitumumab chemotherapy toxicity plan . Treatment involve induction phase panitumumab 1 hour intravenous infusion dosage 6 mg/kg , give every two week , plus FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy standard guideline . Before start FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab , time enrollment , patient immediately randomize electronically 1:1 one two maintenance arm . Induction treatment FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab continue progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity inform consent withdrawal , 8 cycle . At end induction treatment , presence complete partial response , stable disease , non-progressing patient allocate one two pre-assigned maintenance arm : A ) 5-FU/LV ( De Gramont regimen ) plus panitumumab give 6 mg/Kg every two week progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity inform consent withdrawal B ) Panitumumab alone give 6 mg/Kg every two week progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity inform consent withdrawal Imaging study ( thorax abdominal CT MRI scan ) perform baseline ( 4 week prior enrollment ) every 8 week ( 4 cycle ) treatment . The sample size calculated basis non-inferiority hypothesis median PFS panitumumab alone compare 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin panitumumab , take account median PFS 10 month observe PRIME trial . An overall sample size 224 subject ( 112 control group 112 study group ) achieve 90 % power detect probability 50 % control group maximum difference 15 % study group , significance level 0.1 . The drop-out rate 15 % . The accrual pattern two group uniform ( allocation 1:1 ) . The study last 24 month enrollment 12 month follow-up</detailed_description>
