	<brief_summary>The study , fund Bill Melinda Gates Foundation , test novel demand generation strategy , `` Stylish Man '' , increase uptake safe voluntary male circumcision ( VMC ) HIV Rakai , Uganda . With President 's Emergency Fund AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) fund , Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) provide VMC Rakai District , Uganda . The investigator ' ongoing 54 village Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) , community HIV prevalence range 6 % 42 % , provide longitudinal data rate VMC coverage HIV incidence . The investigator preliminary evidence VMC reduce HIV incidence Rakai , coverage remain suboptimal ( elsewhere Africa ) , reduce program impact . The investigator ' data suggest VMC `` supply '' limit factor , `` deficit demand '' . Based extensive qualitative research , investigator develop piloted innovative male-focused VMC demand generation strategy , `` Stylish Man Program '' ( SMP ) . The VMP strive `` demedicalize '' VMC de-emphasizing health-focused message instead stress `` take charge life '' . The SMP two distinct related element : ( 1 ) mass medium ( MM ) via radio poster ; ( 2 ) community-level mobilization via `` Stylish Man Event '' ( SMEvent ) include multimedia medium ( Stylish Van , video , music , health promoter ) investigator embed VMC promotion , immediate access service . In study , investigator conduct one year cluster randomize trial MM plus SMEvents ( intervention arm ) compare MM alone ( control ) , 20 RCCS community , half randomzied intervention half control arm . The primary outcome intent-to-treat community-level rate VMC coverage arm , ie. , percentage non-muslim men arm accept adopt MMC . ( Over 95 % Muslim men Rakai already receive male circumcision infancy . ) As secondary outcome , also monitor rate key behavior HIV incidence , compare arm rate observe community arm prior study initiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Demand Generation Safe Voluntary Male Circumcision ( VMC ) HIV Prevention ( Stylish Man ) , Rakai , Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment strategy : The investigator propose pragmatic cluster-randomized trial effect MM+SMEvent ( intervention ) versus MM alone ( control ) VMC coverage . In addition , RCCS data trial initiation provide data trend VMC coverage , HIV incidence key behavior arm trial . In trial control community provide assessment effect mass medium alone . The `` pragmatic '' approach allow modification SMP component base feedback iterative assessment , would case normal program practice . Cluster randomize trial component : - 20 Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) community randomize intervention arm control arm ( 10 community arm ) . The cluster stratify community characteristic ( e.g. , fishing village , main road hub , agrarian village ) , randomize within stratum . Intervention arm : ~ ten cluster randomly assign receive SMEvent activity one year study , addition ongoing district-wide MM . The SMEvents include community mobilization describe , carry conjunction mobile service camp conduct time SMEvent . The ~10 community ( control arm ) expose MM year , receive SMEvents . All control community receive VMC standard mobile service camp , order enhance comparability service arm . Services arm offer per Uganda CDC PEPFAR guideline . Pre-post component : The MM campaign radio cover large proportion population Rakai randomize . However , RCCS provide longitudinal information population-level rate VMC coverage since service introduce ( 7+ year ago ) , well data behavior ( condom use , number partner , etc… ) HIV incidence . Thus , within control arm community , investigator data require determine proportion population expose mass medium , whether MM associate increase VMC demand adoption . The rate service uptake RCCS essentially plateaued past 3 RCCS round , upward inflection follow MM startup suggest program effect . The investigator also conduct pre-post comparison SMEvent+MM arm . As described , investigator add question RCCS enhance SMP evaluation . VMC uptake also assess service statistic , since RHSP/MOH collaboration primary provider VMC RCCS community . Methods data collection : 1 . The annual RCCS community survey use collect data random sample 70 resident non-Muslim men age 18-49 per community ~700 men per arm , ~1,400 men ) . The RCCS continue collect detail data VMC adoption , sociodemographics , behavior ( include number types partner , condom use ) . The investigator add module RCCS evaluate exposure SMP ( mass medium , SMEvent ) , perception component SMP ( positive negative ) , perception VMC service degree acceptable within respondent 's family , peer group community ; whether respondent conversation partner , family and/or peer VMC . whether individual accept VMC result campaign , , ( ) main influence ( ) ( i.e. , information , find peer use service , friends spouse encourage uptake result campaign , easy access service , etc….. ) The report utilization validate clinic data . Although HIV incidence primary study outcome , HIV test conduct within RCCS ( standard practice ) use three rapid test algorithm , EIA and/or PCR confirmation newly identify HIV+ in-migrants new seroconverters . Serum sample RCCS archive -80 C future study community viral load , future grant . The investigator conduct RCCS survey approximately 2-3 month SMEvent intervention community . The RCCS conduct approximately time match control community , enhance comparability . 2 . Process data : Records keep SMP activity : radio spot interview , schedule SMEvent activity , etc . SMEvent process data include estimate number participant day , photo take assist count . Approximately 12 short anonymous `` spot interview '' conduct daily SMEvent site daily young old men , gauge interest activity , positive negative perception , suggestion improvement . 3 . Clinic-based evaluation : Both mobile SMEvent service standard mobile clinic control community , record keep service client 's age , venue date . ( Client medical record include individual 's name , retain separately research record . ) Clients ask motivated accept service ( SMP component , people get service , encouragement someone influence SMP , factor unrelated SMP , etc… ) Cost data : The investigator propose formal cost benefit analysis . However , cost campaign closely track ( cost radio spot , personnel/materials SMEvent , fuel , administrative support cost , additional cost PEPFAR extend even service hour , etc… ) . The focus service-related cost , research outlay track separately .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Please note : community randomize trial , inclusion exclusion criterion exposure mass medium Stylish Man Events ; anyone community may hear message attend Stylish Man Event . Criteria interview : This intervention evaluate via interview 70 men 10 intervention 10 control village ( total n = 1,400 ) . Criteria interview include male , nonMuslim , resident study community , aged 1849 , able willing sign put fingerprint inform consent form . Nonresidence community ; inability unwillingness sign write consent interview , age year 18 49 . Please note : question `` Accepts healthy volunteer '' apply ; logical way answer study . We test medical individual level intervention ; community member expose mass medium community HIV prevention program , Stylish Man Program . Interviews conduct anyone healthy enough comprehend sign/fingerprint consent form , otherwise health criterion .</criteria>
