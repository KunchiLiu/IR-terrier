	<brief_summary>Oxygen concentration patient undergoing cardiac catheterization admission intensive care unit important outcome measure clinical care . Currently , tool use monitor oxygen concentration central venous access position superior vena cava pulmonary artery monitor central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) . However , invasive always possible due lack central line access . In research study , investigator would like use noninvasive mean ScvO2 use thenar tissue oxygen concentration ( StO2 ) . The primary aim study determine thenar StO2 correlate ScvO2 serve noninvasive surrogate ScvO2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thenar Tissue Oxygen Concentration ( StO2 ) : A Non-invasive Surrogate Central Venous Oxygen Saturation ( ScvO2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants undergo cardiac catheterization Shands Children 's Hospital admit intensive care unit , part clinical care either central venous access position superior vena cava pulmonary artery . As part routine clinical care blood gas frequently take continuous evaluation therapy monitor central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) . A measurement thenar tissue oxygen concentration time central venous blood gas draw monitor tissue oxygen concentration ( StO2 ) . The StO2 measurement take use InSpectraTM StO2 monitor manufacture Hutchinson Technology INC. apply noninvasive clip probe thenar eminence right hand measure StO2 level . After stable reading obtain 60 second record . The two different measurement oxygen concentration compare determine correlation exists .</detailed_description>
