	<brief_summary>Background : Pancreatitis frequent complication endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , account substantial morbidity , occasional mortality , increase health care expenditures . Until recently , effective method prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis ( PEP ) prophylactic pancreatic stent placement ( PSP ) , intervention costly , time consuming , technically challenge , potentially dangerous . The investigator recently report result large randomize controlled trial demonstrate rectal indomethacin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , reduce risk pancreatitis ERCP high-risk patient , ( &gt; 80 % ) receive pancreatic stent . Secondary analysis RCT suggest subject receive indomethacin alone less likely develop PEP receive pancreatic stent alone combination indomethacin stent , even adjust underlie difference subject risk . If indomethacin obviate need PSP , major clinical cost benefit ERCP practice could realize . Objective : To assess whether rectal indomethacin alone non-inferior combination rectal indomethacin prophylactic pancreatic stent placement prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis high-risk case . Methods : Comparative effectiveness multi-center non-inferiority trial rectal indomethacin alone vs. combination rectal indomethacin prophylactic pancreatic stent placement prevention post-ERCP pancreatitis high-risk patient . One thousand four hundred thirty subject elevate risk PEP would normally receive pancreatic stent prophylaxis randomize indomethacin alone combination indomethacin PSP . The proportion patient develop PEP moderate-severe PEP compare . In addition , investigator establish quality-assured central repository biological specimen obtain study participant , permit future translational research elucidate molecular genetic mechanism PEP , well mechanisms non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug prevent complication .</brief_summary>
