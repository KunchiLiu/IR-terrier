	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To provide patient severe hypercholesterolemia risk subsequent cardiovascular ( CV ) event adequately control currently available lipid-modifying therapy ( LMT ) access alirocumab ahead commercial availability document overall safety tolerability alirocumab patient population . Secondary Objectives : To document effect alirocumab low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level well non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non-HDL-C ) , total cholesterol ( total-C ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , triglyceride ( TG ) level 12 week treatment . To document patient 's acceptability self-injection ( Self Injection Assessment Questionnaire , SIAQ ) .</brief_summary>
