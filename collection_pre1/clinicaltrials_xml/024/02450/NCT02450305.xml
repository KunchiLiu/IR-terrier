	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Its Effect Radiation Induced Long Term Side Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy commonly utilized treatment modality head neck cancer patient . Xerostomia ( i.e . dry mouth ) ( taste change ) common significant side effect treatment . Xerostomia lead several complication patient include difficulty chewing , speaking , swallow , taste smell abnormality , oral infection inflammation , osteoradionecrosis , dental caries periodontal disease . These condition tend lead overall decreased quality life patient affect . A possible modality treatment xerostomia use hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) therapy . HBO medical use oxygen level high atmospheric pressure . It propose HBO result accelerate blood vessel growth repair tissue injury increase oxygen partial pressure gradient ( Bennett , 2005 ) . Today , use HBO widely accept treatment prevention radiation induce toxicity osteoradionecrosis soft tissue necrosis . Here Upstate University Hospital , investigator treat approximately 20 patient year hyperbaric oxygen either prevention management radiation induce complication osteoradionecrosis /or soft tissue necrosis . The investigator would like use group patient evaluate effect HBO improvement radiation induce xerostomia ( taste change ) . The investigator ' data collect patient use periodic quality life questionnaires 5 timepoints , well data relate treatment patient give . .</detailed_description>
