	<brief_summary>Background : - Without explanation severe sometimes life-threatening symptom , patient family leave state unknown . The NIH help create network medical research center , call Undiagnosed Diseases Network ( UDN ) , provide care answer individual . Objectives : - To improve diagnosis care people undiagnosed disease . Eligibility : - People undiagnosed disease , relative . Design : - Participants travel one UDN medical center 5-day clinical research visit . - As part visit , UDN healthcare provider may ask participant : - Clinically indicated test procedure perform include : - A physical exam - Blood urine test - A review health family history - X-rays body scan - Surveys - Photographs face body - A special diet see body handle food without reaction , like vomit - Video voice recording - Other test procedure help reach diagnosis - Research test procedure perform include : - A skin biopsy . For , small piece skin take . - Surveys - Other test procedure research may relate diagnosis treatment . - Most participant ask give sample genetic testing . - Participants may contact visit discuss test result . They may also contact future interview survey . - Relatives participant may ask give sample genetic test . They may ask part visit record additional test . They may also contact future interview survey . - Clinical research information collect stored database . - Information sample collect share others research purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Genetic Evaluation Individuals With Undiagnosed Disorders Through Undiagnosed Diseases Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Without explanation severe sometimes life-threatening symptom , patient family leave state unknown . Many individual find passed physician physician , undergo countless often repetitive test hop find answer insight future may hold . This long arduous journey find diagnosis end many patients- Office Rare Diseases Research ( ORDR ) note 6 % individual seek assistance undiagnosed disorder . In 2008 , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Undiagnosed Diseases Program ( UDP ) establish goal provide care answer individual mysterious condition long elude diagnosis . The NIH UDP joint venture NIH ORDR , National Human Genome Research Institute Intramural Research Program ( NHGRI-IRP ) , NIH Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) . The goal NIH UDP : ( 1 ) provide answer patient undiagnosed disease ; ( 2 ) generate new knowledge disease mechanism ; ( 3 ) ass application new approach phenotyping use genomic technology ; ( 4 ) identify potential therapeutic target , possible . To date , UDP evaluate 3300 medical record admit 750 individual rare undiagnosed condition NIH Clinical Center . The NIH UDP identify 70 rare disease diagnose several new condition . The success NIH UDP prompt NIH Common Fund support establishment network medical research center , Undiagnosed Diseases Network ( UDN ) , fiscal year 2013-2020 . The clinical site perform extensive phenotyping , genetic analysis , functional study potential disease-causing variant . The testing perform patient involve medically indicated study intend help reach diagnosis , well research investigation include skin biopsy , blood draw , DNA analysis . In addition , UDN goal UDP permit share personally identifiable phenotypic genotypic information within network . By share participant information encourage collaboration , UDN hop improve understand rare condition advance diagnostic process care individual undiagnosed disease .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The applicant condition remain undiagnosed despite thorough evaluation healthcare provider least one objective finding . The applicant ( legal guardian ) agree storage share information biomaterials identify fashion amongst UDN center , deidentified fashion research sit beyond network . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The applicant diagnosis explain objective finding . Review record suggest diagnosis evaluation theUDN deem unnecessary . The UDN unlikely improve comprehensive workup applicant already receive The applicant seriously ill travel safely UDN site telemedicine/distance consult possible appropriate .</criteria>
