	<brief_summary>This study randomize , multicenter , open-label , Phase 2 study run 2 part : safety run-in part determine dose azacitidine second part determine efficacy dose child young adult acute myeloid leukemia molecular relapse first complete remission . Indication Treatment child young adult molecular relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) first complete remission ( CR1 ) . Objectives Primary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish safe tolerable dose azacitidine use randomize part study . Randomized Part To evaluate effect azacitidine treatment AML subject molecular relapse CR1 compare treatment regard progression-free rate ( PFR ) Day 84 ( ±4 day ) post randomization . Secondary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish azacitidine plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter subject molecular relapse AML CR1 ass efficacy . Randomized Part To evaluate safety , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , efficacy azacitidine treatment subject molecular relapse AML CR1 . Study Design The population trial consist child young adult AML achieve complete response ( CR ) molecular remission , define Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) less 5 x 10-4 , follow initial induction therapy subsequently molecular relapse ( defined increase MRD level least 1 log [ 10-fold ] level great equal 5 x 10-4 despite normal percentage [ &lt; 5 % ] myeloblasts bone marrow [ BM ] aspirate peripheral blood [ PB ] , absence proven histological extramedullary relapse ) . Eligible subject document diagnosis AML least one follow molecular aberration ( 8 ; 21 ) , RUNX1-RUNX1T1 , inv ( 16 ) , CBFb/MYH11 , ( 9 ; 11 ) , MLL-AF9 , NPM1 mutation , FLT3-ITD mutation . Enrolled/randomized pediatric subject follow regular MRD test order detect molecular relapse . In safety run-in part , 12 subject age 3 month le 18 year enrol . Six subject enrol first cohort 100 mg/m2 azacitidine administer intravenously ( IV ) Days 1 7 28-day cycle . Six additional subject could enrol second cohort 75 mg/m2 azacitidine administer IV Days 1 7 28-day cycle depend safety tolerability result 100 mg/m2 cohort . In randomized part study least 68 subject randomize ( depend whether least 64 subject evaluable primary endpoint ) , least 60 subject less 18 year age . Both part study , safety run-in part randomize part , contain 3 period : screening period , treatment period follow-up period . The screening period last 10 day safety run-in part subject may enrol treat . In randomized part , screen period last indefinite amount time detection molecular relapse PB follow confirmation relapse PB BM aspirate , point subject may randomize . Subjects treat azacitidine ( safety run-in part ) accordance assign treatment arm ( randomized part ) . Upon discontinuation treatment period , subject enter follow-up period last 2 year last patient enrolled/randomized .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Population Subjects AML molecular relapse CR1 , age 3 month le 18 year age safety run-in part , 3 month le 21 year age randomize part . Length Study Study duration estimate last approximately 9 year time first subject enrollment completion follow-up period subject enrolled/randomized . Estimated duration base expect duration study treatment/'watch wait ' period ( 3 month ) completion follow-up period ( 2 year randomization last subject ) . The End Trial define either date last visit last subject complete study , date receipt last data point last subject require primary , secondary and/or exploratory analysis , pre-specified protocol and/or Statistical Analysis Plan , whichever later date . Study Treatments Safety Run-in Part Intravenous azacitidine 100 mg/m2 possible decrease cohort 75 mg/m2 , Days 1 7 28-day cycle maximum 3 cycle . Randomized Part Intravenous azacitidine dose establish safety run-in part Days 1 7 28-day cycle maximum 3 cycle ( subject randomize azacitidine arm ) . Overview Efficacy Assessments The primary endpoint randomize part , PFR Day 84 ( ±4 day ) post randomization , assess Day 80 88 ( approximately end Cycle 3 active treatment ) post randomization control experimental arm . In case clinical relapse , investigator ask document evaluate morphology immunophenotyping BM aspirate PB . This must do accord standardize diagnostic procedure contain AML BFM 2012 guideline ( Creutzig , 2012 ) . Overview Safety Assessments Subject safety assess visit study . Any AE report recorded AE electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . For serious adverse event ( SAEs ) expedite report procedure use addition AE eCRF . The rate AEs SAEs , include second malignancy cardiovascular event event special interest study , abnormal laboratory value vital sign ( NCI CTC Criteria version 4.0 use grade AEs ) collect subject study therapy 'watch wait ' period . Once subject start next-line therapy HSCT , SAEs relate study treatment ( experimental arm ) HSCT collect safety analysis . Overview Statistical Methods Subjects safety run-in part randomization part shall use analysis safety efficacy endpoint common part study . In addition , PK analysis perform subject safety run-in part , analysis PFR endpoint endpoint unique randomized part perform randomized subject . One interim analysis futility primary endpoint plan randomization part study first 32 ( 50 % 64 ) randomize subject become evaluable primaryendpoint analysis . The study stop criterion futility meet . Subject demographic baseline characteristic , disposition , safety data present study part well treatment dose ( safety run-in part ) study arm ( randomized part ) well aggregate subject receive azacitidine regardless study part . All efficacy base endpoint present treatment arm . First data analysis reporting safety run-in part conduct final dose assessment SMC meeting hold ( final safety run-in SMC date = data cut-off initial analysis safety run-in part ) . This analysis consist safety run-in primary endpoint PK secondary endpoint . All safety run-in part secondary endpoint analyzed time analysis report data randomize part . In addition PK data analysis , secondary endpoint analyze report require base subject least 6 month enrollment ( safety run-in part ) randomization ( randomization part ) .</detailed_description>
