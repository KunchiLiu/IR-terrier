	<brief_title>Prohealth @ Home : A Feasibility Study Investigating Use Lifestyle App People Risk Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes chronic condition . Currently 2.9 million people diagnosed diabetes UK , estimate 850,000 people condition unaware ( Diabetes UK , 2011 ) . Due age population increase obesity , Type 2 diabetes increase alarm rate . Diabetes UK ( 2011 ) predict 2025 , number people diabetes rise 5 million . Recent study indicate third adult population England prediabetes ( Mainous et al 2014 ) . A condition occur glucose level higher normal high enough diagnosed diabetes ; 5 10 % people prediabetes go develop diabetes year ( Tabak et al 2012 ) . Lifestyle intervention aim make healthy dietary choice , increase activity level lose excess body weight show reduce risk prediabetes progress Type 2 diabetes 58 % ( Penn et al. , 2013 ) . However , practice high level professional support couple increase incidence prediabetes sustainable current format . Synthesis data population study , suggest potential less intensive intervention feasible able reduce risk progression diabetes ( Johnson et al. , 2013 ) . The internet potential provide alternative mean support large number individual make diet activity change . However , study highlight information provision enough engage individual change , additional support via personalised feedback require sustain level motivation need long term behaviour change ( Estabrook et al. , 2005 ; Nes et al. , 2013 ) . The investigator hypothesis communicate individual high risk Type 2 diabetes via web-based lifestyle app lead change lifestyle behaviour ( diet activity ) result improved glycaemic control reduction diabetes risk . To conduct rigorous evaluation novel intervention require large expensive multi-centre RCT . However , several area uncertainty need remove investigator could conduct study confidence . At time , investigator wish reasonably certain intervention test large trial good chance successful . Thus purpose present study determine feasibility web-based lifestyle app intervention people prediabetes hence determining acceptability , practicability , integration efficacy main study 's procedure . Methods : The study conduct 6 month general practice . A convenience sample consent patient ( n=30 ) register GP practice high risk develop diabetes invite take part feasibility study . Intervention This consist web-based lifestyle app personalise behaviour modification advice register dietitian deliver via messaging . Participants issue pedometer instructed wear daily wakeful non-bathing activity . Participants access web-based material prediabetes lifestyle app . Data dietary intake activity level collect web-based lifestyle app , password protect . Contact dietitian participant consist weekly messaging facilitate change diet activity behaviour motivational cognitive behavioural strategy . Changes diet activity level record personalised goal monitor reviewed participant dietitian . In addition participant encourage complete 5 day food diary use household measure estimate food portion size weight ( include weekend plus 3 week day ) 5 time point study ( week 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 22 ) . The dietary data collect on-line food diary use participant self-monitor progress dietary recommendation base guideline Diabetes UK NICE ( 2012 ) , highlight web platform . Data Collection Blood biochemistry ( HbA1c , FBG , LFT 's lipid ) , BP , weight , height , BMI waist circumference measure baseline , 3 6 month . The blood test take practice nurse GP practice send analysis . Five day food diary ( 5 consecutive day period include weekend plus 3 week day use 24hr food diary ) activity questionnaire ( plus data 7 day via activity tracker ) collect baseline , 3 6 month . To minimise contamination first 2 day activity data discard . A follow telephone interview conduct enhance accuracy food diary . This method responsive dietary change food frequency questionnaire recommend assess intervention-related dietary change ( Harris et al. , 2011 ) . The following questionnaire data collect baseline , 3 6 month : Functional Health Status measure use validated Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Survey ( SF-36 ) ( Ware Sherbourne , 1992 ) . WHO wellbeing index 5 item questionnaire monitor change psychological well-being relation change treatment regimen screen depression ( Hajos et al. , 2013 ) .

Data collect via semi-structured interview audio- record transcribed thematic analysis .</detailed_description>
