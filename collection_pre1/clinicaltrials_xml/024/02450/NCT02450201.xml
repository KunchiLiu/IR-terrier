	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical study hyperpolarized pyruvate ( 13C ) injection include acquisition magnetic resonance ( MR ) data perform men localize prostate cancer . Part 1 : Five patient evaluate reproducibility 13C HP MR image measurement obtain 2-3 week apart interim treatment . Part 2 : Five patient evaluate change 13C HP MR image measurement 2 month ADT . 13C HP MR data acquire two part study ( occur simultaneously ) : Part 1 : Patients undergo image baseline repeat two three week later ( intervention interim ) evaluate reproducibility . Part 2 : Patients undergo image baseline , initiate androgen deprivation therapy , undergo repeat image two month initiation ADT evaluate ability image reflect metabolic response treatment . The change pyruvate/lactate ratio lactate level measure compare baseline timepoints .</brief_summary>
