	<detailed_description>The role mechanical ventilation patient undergo general anesthesia worldwide well know associate dangerous effect pulmonary complication , increase postoperative morbidity mortality . Lung-protective ventilation use low tidal volume positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , reduce morbidity mortality patient acute respiratory distress syndrome consider strong recommendation patient undergo general anesthesia . At moment guideline define kind ventilation use . Patients without acute lung injury still ventilate large —and perhaps large— tidal volume . A recent multicenter randomize control trial conclude use lung-protective ventilation strategy intermediate-risk high-risk patient undergo major abdominal surgery associate improved clinical outcome reduce health care utilization . A multicentre randomize control trial mechanical ventilation general anesthesia open abdominal surgery conclude intraoperative protective ventilation strategy include low tidal volume low PEEP , without recruitment maneuver . In 52 patient undergoing general anesthesia open thoracic surgery lung protective ventilation associate well intraoperative postoperative oxygenation , short duration postoperative mechanical ventilation ICU admission withdrawal . In conclusion protective ventilation , low tidal volume low PEEP , seem gold standard intra-operative mechanical ventilation general anesthesia . Mechanical ventilation represent important tool obtain cerebral de-bulking neurosurgery maintain moderate hypocapnia positive intra-thoracic pressure low possible . For reason application PEEP high tidal volume historically see unfavourable neuro-anesthesiologists neurosurgeon fear transmission intracranial compartment high venous pressure value consequent brain swell eventually cerebral perfusion pressure reduction . Nevertheless , recent study suggest patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) PEEP seem well tolerate without deleterious intracranial effect role context protective ventilation protocol associate low tidal volume , low expect intra-thoracic pressure , never study patient undergo general anesthesia intracranial surgery neoplasms . The traditional high-volume-no-PEEP ventilation strategy , call way consist high tidal volume protective ventilation PEEP , neurosurgery compare recently propose protective ventilation order eventually assess possible difference respiratory neurological outcome . At purpose pilot study need determine effect size variability possible difference dural tension two ventilation strategy . Null hypothesis : Shifting traditional ventilation protocol protective one general anesthesia change level dural tension patient undergone elective neurosurgery brain neoplasm . To determine effect size variability dural tension difference patient undergo intracranial neurosurgery ventilate either traditional protective ventilation . Mono-centric , double blind , 1:1 randomize , 2x2 crossover clinical trial . Patients randomize receive either traditional protective ventilation first ventilation . Randomization perform computer generate sequence . The result randomization transfer sealed envelope , one patient . When patient randomize study , envelop open piece information randomization present envelop follow operating room anesthesiologist .</detailed_description>
