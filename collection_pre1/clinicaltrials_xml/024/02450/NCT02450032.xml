	<brief_title>Study Determine Antibody Response 500µg G17DT Treatment Patients With Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Another study , GC2 , initiate prior start study investigate appropriate dose dose schedule G17DT patient Stage I-III gastric cancer . The high dose test GC2 study 250µg . This dose well tolerate consider sufficiently immunogenic . Since tolerability constrain dose 250µg , GC5 study design investigate 500µg dose administer regimen 0 , 2 , 6 week .</detailed_description>
