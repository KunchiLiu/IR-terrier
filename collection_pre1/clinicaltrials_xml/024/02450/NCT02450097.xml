	<brief_summary>The aim present study investigate subject without type 2 diabetes effect calorie restriction ( CR ) accord 5:2 method 6 month ( every week two day caloric fast 500 calorie woman 600 calorie men five day normal caloric intake ) risk marker cardiovascular disease certain cancer ( hyperinsulinemia , insulin resistance , IGF-1 , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-2 , glucose , HbA1c , blood lipid , marker inflammation oxidative stress ) peptides regulate glucose metabolism appetite well effect blood pressure , body composition , waist- hip- circumference . DNA also analyse start 6 month investigate epigenetic effect . After complete study follow additional 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Hormonal Effects 5:2 Intermittent Fasting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : It well know majority population western world eats much calorie relation physical activity . This result increase body weight , insulin resistance premature age-related disease diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , even dementia certain type cancer like colon cancer breast cancer . Several study show calorie restriction ( CR ) reduce risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes Alzheimer 's disease . Animal study show CR reduces insulin like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) level , cancer incidence prolong lifespan . Chronic every day CR decrease blood lipid glucose , blood pressure , insulin resistance inflammatory marker . It show reduce incidence atherosclerosis directly correlate CR weight reduction . However , study investigate effect periodic CR healthy subject adiposity patient type 2 diabetes . Moreover , study knowledge study gender difference metabolic response periodic CR response dependent degree adiposity metabolic disturbance . Since many people difficult every day reduce caloric intake , new method reduce 25 % normal intake two day week great interest study regard metabolic hormonal effect men woman . Questions answer ; Do woman men respond differently diet subject type 2 diabetes respond differently without diabetes . How many subject continue follow new diet 6 month study 6 month follow ? Primary end point : Change baseline fast serum insulin , C-peptide insulin like factor bind protein-1 ( IGFBP-1 ) 6 month . Secondary end point : Changes body composition include body fat percentage , blood pressure , blood lipid , blood glucose , marker inflammation , oxidative stress hormone regulate appetite , change wellbeing , diet habit physical activity . Material/Subjects : 100 subject recruit via medium outpatient clinic diabetes care Karolinska University Hospital Sophiahemmet Hospital Stockholm , Sweden . Method : The subject give informed consent get questionnaire regard well-being , physical activity , life style , family history diabetes , obesity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , cancer dementia , previous medical weight history drug use . The subject examine doctor screen visit blood urine sample take . Waist hip circumference , blood pressure pulse sit position 10 minute rest , estimation body composition , percent body fat free fat mass ( muscle mass ) register . The subject also respond questionnaire regard diet habit meal diary three ordinary day . A group 10 15 subject informed meeting doctor , nurse dietitian diet ( give 25 example ) 2 day calorie restriction recommend diet ( Mediterranean Nordic diet ) 5 day week . The subject respond question regard hunger , fullness satiety 2 day calorie restriction ( 500 woman 600 men ) register 25 possible give meal select calorie restriction day every week 26 week . After 6 week follow new blood urine test , wellbeing questionnaire 3 6 month new blood urine test , physical examination , questionnaires regard physical activity , wellbeing , diet habit meal diary 3 day . After complete study follow additional 6 month participant free choose continue CR . At visit blood pressure , pulse ; waist hip circumference body composition register . The blood urine sample take morning overnight fast day normal diet . The blood urine sample store local human sample bank hospital later analysis study close .</detailed_description>
