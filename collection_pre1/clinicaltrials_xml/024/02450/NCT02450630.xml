	<brief_summary>Uganda 's under-five mortality high , currently estimate 90/1000 live birth ( Uganda Bureau Statistics 2011 ) . Poor referral sick child seek care private sector one contributory factor . The propose intervention aim improve uptake referral advice child seek care private facility ( register drug shops/private clinic ) . The project implement Mukono district , central Uganda select recent concluded trial district show drug shop vendor ( DSVs ) adhere diagnostic test result , treat appropriately refer sick child ; although uptake referral poor . The main reason attribute observed poor referral negative attitude towards referral form drug shop health worker referral facility , perception poor quality care referral facility cost involve ( Hutchinson . 2012 ; Hutchinson et al . 2013 press ) .. Thus propose project follow address factor aim improve uptake referral . This project line Uganda 's Health sector USAID Mission 's health priority strengthen health system . Critical barrier implementation child survival intervention poor quality care private sector timely referral uptake referral advice community level . These barrier may attribute inadequate training provider private sector ( diagnosis management childhood illness ) ; inadequate supervision regulation ; poor linkage collaboration public private sector ; non-existent linkage community structure private sector . The barrier address intervention three component ; ) VHTs train community sensitization initiate community discussion aim identify community support mechanisms financial hardship ( community lead manage ) - e.g . community encourage establish community credit/insurance scheme referral VHTs register child facilitate follow sick child ii ) supervision provider private sector diagnose , treat refer sick child , iii ) regular meeting public private provider ( convene district health team ) discuss referral system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Effect Strengthening Referral Sick Children From Private Health Sector Its Impact Referral Uptake Uganda .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Questions/Goals Specific Objectives : Research question : The study aim answer question whether integrated intervention VHT registration child ( registration child enable follow VHTs ) , community sensitization regular meeting public private provider referral sick child target woman men cost-effective improve uptake referral advice . Goal : The goal study assess effect strengthen referral system private sector uptake referral advice cost-effectiveness . The project address poor referral child one challenge reduction under-five mortality Uganda . Primary objective : 1 . To ass effect strengthen referral system uptake referral sick child seek care private sector . Secondary objective 1 . To explore factor influence referral non-referral sick child private sector . 2 . To assess cost effectiveness uptake referral sick child seek care private sector . Uganda 's under-five mortality high , currently estimate 90/1000 live birth ( UDHS , 2011 ) Poor referral sick child seek care private sector one contributory factor . Previous study Uganda elsewhere find referral sick child high level care poor ( Oryema , 2009 , Achan et al 2011 ; Font et al 2002 , Kallander et al 2006 ) , In Uganda several study estimate referral child low 8 % ( Kallander et al 2006 ) 28 % ( Peterson et al 2004 ) . Several factor attribute poor referral like long distance health facility , high cost involve referral , poor attitude health worker , lack drug health facility lack involvement father referral process ( Mbonye 2003 , Font et al 2002 ) . A study Uganda find 70 % patient sought treatment private clinic within 1 week onset symptom 7 % properly manage ( treat accord National Guidelines ) . The study conclude private facility possible strategy include train social marketing prepackaged treatment STDs ( Jacobs et al 2004 ) . In Tanzania , find urban private-sector clinic , flexible clinic hour , prompt service , effort improve respect , privacy confidentiality may prove helpful increase visit adherence ( Miller et al 2014 ) . The propose intervention aim improve referral uptake referral advice child seek care private facility address constraint referral child . The private sector provider participate project include private clinic register drug shop . A recently conclude trial show staff drug shop mainly female , 50 % qualified health worker ( state enrol nurse ) . The majority drug shop vendor receive prior training malaria case management , little knowledge baseline ACT first-line anti-malarial drug , mRDT use ( Mbonye et al . submit , 2014 ) . The project implement Mukono District , Central Uganda . There high prevalence diarrhea ( 22.3 % ) , acute respiratory tract infection ( 12 % ) fever ( 42 % ) among child age &lt; 5 year ( Uganda Bureau Statistics 2011 ) . This district select recent conclude trial show drug shop vendor ( DSVs ) adhere malaria diagnostic test result , treat appropriately refer sick child ; although uptake referral poor . Thus propose project therefore follow ass factor lead poor uptake referral . The main focus project implement community-based intervention encourage uptake referral . This non-compliance delayed uptake referral threaten child survival . The project target child age less five year , especially rural area poor access health intervention . Three barrier effective treatment poor quality care private sector , timely referral , uptake referral advice community level . Poor quality care private sector may attribute inadequate training provider private sector ( diagnosis management childhood illness ) ; inadequate supervision regulation ; poor linkage collaboration public private sector . Poor uptake referral advice may due lack awareness severe sign childhood illness consequence ; poor preparation household 's especially inadequate male involvement child care ; non-existent linkage community structure public-private sector . The cost-effectiveness sustainability innovative way scale intervention know . The propose research implement district endemic malaria , pneumonia diarrhea peri-urban rural area . It numerous register drug shop private clinic capable diagnose febrile illness RDTs treat malaria appropriately refer sick child ( Mbonye et al 2013 , submit ) . The target population child febrile illness seek treatment private outlet . It hypothesize raise community awareness target household ( woman spouse ) initiate discussion save scheme referral cost lead completion referral advice sick child . The intervention support qualitative study explore reason uptake referral ; lesson policy action . The contextual issue explore qualitative research include involvement community structure ( VHTs ) raise awareness , modality linkages community public-private health facility , incentives referral . The first aspect innovation use VHTs register child community sensitization . The second innovation project introduce integrated management malaria , pneumonia diarrhea private outlet , implement community level health facility . The third aspect innovation involve private sector referral sick child . Understanding referral system new research area could inform private-public interaction wider public health implication child survival . There meeting convene district health system private public provider study community introduce study discuss referral process . Referral form develop discussed stakeholder ; well SOPs handle referral case . In previous trial RDTs drug shop Mukono district , referral form local language health worker despise . In present study investigator shall modify pilot form English , put place support intervention foster acceptance referral private sector . The third aspect innovation involve VHTs , establish community structure ( MOH , 1999 ; MOH 2010 ) register child age less 5 year , distribute health education material enlist male head household woman active care referral child . Since men crucial decision make control resource , investigator hypothesize innovation likely improve timely referral uptake referral advice . VHTs currently collaboration private sector thus create link VHTs private sector creative likely provide lesson future scale health intervention . Meetings private public provider never take place establish interaction would innovative . The immediate sustainable impact appropriate treatment sick child . The long term effect reduction child mortality , may lead reduction fertility woman would embrace family plan method survival child improve . The potential scientific impact project evaluate capture data referral , sick child refer , uptake referral compare two arm . 3 . Objectives &amp; Outcome Measure ( ) A . Study objectives Primary objective : 1 . To assess effect strengthen referral system uptake referral sick child seek care private sector . Secondary objective 1 . To explore factor influence referral non-referral sick child private sector . 2 . To assess cost-effectiveness timely uptake referral sick child see private sector . B . Study Outcome measure ( ) List describe primary outcome measure applicable , secondary outcome measure include quantitative qualitative outcome . Discuss validity select outcome ( ) . Provide evidence select outcome provide relevant , valid , reliable measure study objective . The primary outcome : â€¢ The proportion sick child refer private sector complete referral process ( see high health facility ) . Co-primary outcome : - Appropriate case management malaria , pneumonia diarrhea among child private sector . - The cost-effectiveness timely uptake referral sick child . Secondary outcome : - The proportion sick child seek care private outlet within 24 hour onset symptom - The time consultation private outlet uptake referral health facility ( referral facility ) - The proportion sick child receive prompt appropriate treatment private sector outlet . - Factors influence referral non-referral sick child private sector . All private outlet arm train record data sick child age less 5years seek care private outlet : 1 . Demographic ( age , sex , relationship caretaker , marital status caretaker , education level , rural/urban residence ) 2 . Social-economic data ( household income , ownership household item determine expenditure consumption level , address telephone contact caretaker ) ) ; 3 . Type illness , treatment give , prescription drug , referral advice , child refer refer . These data capture patient register treatment form distribute intervention control cluster .</detailed_description>
