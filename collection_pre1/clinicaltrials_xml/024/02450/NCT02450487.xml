	<brief_summary>Pharmacogenetics area Pharmacology study contribution genetic factor individual response drug . This branch science involve variability pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics study polymorphisms gene encode receptor , well drug metabolism , area Pharmacology grow achieve first result clinical use . The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDS ) metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) family , predominantly CYP2C9 . The goal study evaluate different gene haplotype clinical efficacy piroxicam third low molar surgery pain , edema trismus , adverse reaction , need rescue medication , patient satisfaction regard drug pharmacokinetics drug different gene haplotype CYP2C9 find population . Therefore , 60 patient genotyped phenotyped gene postoperative data confront data find Brazilian population . For analysis propose gene , saliva collect serve source genomic DNA . For molecular analysis , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test validate produce Applied Biosystems® perform . For pharmacokinetics , saliva sample collect various time accord protocol available literature , piroxicam concentration sample measure high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS ) . The analysis result describe significance level 0.05 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Genotype CYP2C9 Clinical Efficacy Pharmacokinetics Piroxicam After Lower Third Molar Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower third molar ( high degree difficulty ) surgery perform Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory Bauru School Dentistry - University São Paulo ( FOB-USP ) , provide patient daily dos piroxicam 20 mg 4 day . Thus collect data relate pain , swell , trismus , amount rescue medication require patient , overall assessment satisfaction take medicine , saliva sample analysis pharmacokinetics drug , genotyping phenotyping subject research . The global clinical evaluation along genotyping phenotyping individual show u influence adverse effect , also therapeutic effect drug Brazilian population . Research nature rare area Clinical Pharmacogenetics great help prescribe drug control pain inflammation.After removal third molar make collect 6 mL saliva several post-surgical moment analysis pharmacokinetics drug piroxicam 10 mL saliva analysis genetic material . It noteworthy project initiate nucleation new line research college , first Pharmacogenetics area conduct FOB / USP.Will assess follow parameter patient surgery least third low molar high degree difficulty ( Annexes 1 , 2 3 ) : 1 ) onset duration surgery administration local anesthetic , 2 ) open mouth prior surgery , 2nd day surgery 7th day surgery ( removal stitch ) ; 3 ) measure facial edema second day surgery 7th day surgery ( compare measurement obtain surgery ) ; 4 ) body temperature surgery , 2nd day operation 7th day surgery ( removal stitch ) ; 5 ) incidence , type severity adverse reaction , 6 ) plug pain ( VAS - visual analog scale ) fill patient 4 day prescription Piroxicam ; 7 ) amount rescue medication require patient . The comparative analysis data , along data pharmacokinetics drug , genotyping phenotyping CYP2C9 gene , provide basis evaluation influence gene clinical efficacy , side effect need relief medication require patient surgery third- molar high degree difficulty , prescribe anti-inflammatory piroxicam .</detailed_description>
