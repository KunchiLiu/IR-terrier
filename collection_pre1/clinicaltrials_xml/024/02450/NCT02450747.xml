	<criteria>1 . Healthy adult male females age 40 70 full legal capacity volunteer . 2 . The subject current spherical silicone hydrogel multifocal ( SiHy ) contact lens wearer ( define minimum 2 day per week least 6 hour Daily Wear contact lens , minimum one month prior study ) willing wear study lenses daily basis ( define minimum 6 hour wear per day ) duration study . 3 . The subject must pair wearable spectacle wear wear study lens . 4 . The subject 's optimal vertexed spherical equivalent distance correction must +3.50 5.50 Diopters ( D ) ( inclusive ) eye . 5 . Subjective refraction cylinder power must less equal 0.75 D eye . 6 . Requires read addition +0.75 D +2.50 D eye . 7 . The subject must distance near visual acuity best correctable logMAR 0.1 ( 20/25 ) good distance near subjective refraction eye . 8 . The subject must read sign Informed Consent form . 9 . The subject must appear able willing adhere instruction set forth clinical protocol . 1 . Has systemic condition opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable ; 2 . Participant unrelated research clinical trial within 30 day prior enrollment ; 3 . Known infectious disease ( e.g.hepatitis , tuberculosis ) contagious immunosuppressive disease . 4 . Women pregnant lactate plan pregnancy time enrollment ; 5 . Ocular systemic allergy disease might interfere contact lens wear ; 6 . Have systemic disease , autoimmune disease , use medication , may interfere contact lens wear . This may include , limited , hyperthyroidism , recurrent herpes simplex/zoster , Sjogren 's syndrome , xerophthalmia , acne rosacea , StevensJohnson syndromes . 7 . Systemic disease use medication might interfere contact lens wear ; 8 . Any corneal distortion ; 9 . Has know active* ocular disease and/or infection ; 10 . Is use systemic topical medication opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable ; use rewetting drop occasional basis ( great 2 time per week ) . 11 . Is habitual monovision contact lens wearer wear contact lens extend wear basis past 6 month ; 12 . Diagnosed Diabetes ; 13 . Is aphakic ; Has entropion , ectropion , chalazia , recurrent stye , glaucoma , history recurrent corneal erosion . 14 . Has undergone refractive error surgery ; 15 . Has amblyopia strabismus ; 16 . Has anisometropia &gt; 2 D eye ; 17 . Has know sensitivity diagnostic pharmaceutical use study ; 18 . Any grade 3.0 great slit lamp finding ( e.g. , edema , corneal neovascularization , corneal staining , tarsal abnormality , conjunctival injection ) Efron classification scale , previous history sign contact lensrelated corneal inflammatory event ( e.g. , past peripheral ulcer round peripheral scar ) , ocular abnormality may contraindicate contact lens wear ; 19 .
