	<brief_summary>Pre-Hospital Advanced Airway Management ( PHAAM ) potentially lifesaving intervention . A recent Danish multicentre single country study demonstrate 99,7 % incidence successful anaesthesiologist pre-hospital endotracheal intubation , PHAAM-related complication rate 7.9 % . A London study reveal significantly high intubation failure rate among non-anaesthesiologist physician . In Scandinavia different type emergency medical service ( EMS ) profession provide PHAAM . The success rate prehospital endotracheal intubation ( PHETI ) , incidence difficult intubation complication Nordic country know . The aim study define PHAAM success rate complication different type Nordic EMS organisation physician critical care team . The study prospective observational study collection PHAAM data accord template Sollid et al . 12 participate Nordic Countries EMS/HEMS centre physician critical care team . The primary endpoint PHETI success ≤2 attempt complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-Hospital Advanced Airway Management ( PHAAM ) potentially lifesaving intervention . A recent meta-analysis &gt; 15.000 patient report variation prehospital endotracheal intubation ( PHETI ) success rate different method use provider background . A recent prehospital study London reveal significantly high intubation failure rate among non-anaesthesiologist physician . In Scandinavia different type emergency medical service ( EMS ) professional provide PHAAM . The success rate PHETI , incidence difficult intubation complication Nordic country know . Although EMS structure Scandinavia reasonably similar , inter- intra-national difference regard mission profile , staff , system dispatch on-scene management . A Danish PHAAM study demonstrate 99,7 % anaesthesiologist PHETI success rate 7,9 % complication rate . The author conclude study homogenous Danish system limit ability generalise finding system different staffing , caseload case mix . The PHAST investigator aim provide prospective multicentre data pre-hospital intubation success rate complication Nordic country . Additionally investigator compare PHAAM procedure different subgroup patient , region EMS organisation . In PHAST observational study twelve Nordic ( Sweden , Norway , Denmark Finland ) Helicopter Rapid Response Emergency Medical Services include patient 18 month . The decision perform PHAAM base discretion prehospital provider . The PHAAM core data prospectively collect accord template Sollid et al . The primary endpoint PHETI success ≤2 attempt complication . Secondary endpoint include overall PHETI success rate , PHETI success 1st , 2nd , 3rd &gt; 3rd attempt , difficult PHETI , success rate laryngeal mask surgical airway , PHAAM complication prehospital mortality . Through predefined analysis data , PHAST investigator hope 1 . Describe characteristics outcome advance prehospital airway management . 2 . Identify group critically injure ill patient benefit competent advanced prehospital airway management , identify specific area future research .</detailed_description>
