	<brief_summary>This multi-center open-label proof-of-concept study consist two part : PART A - phase I dose-finding study ( 3 + 3 classical design ) evaluate RP2D afatinib combination selumetinib ; PART B - randomize phase II study investigate progression free survival safety selumetinib/afatinib combination therapy compare standard care chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib Selumetinib Advanced KRAS Mutant PIK3CA Wildtype Colorectal , Non-small Cell Lung Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pre-clinical study , treatment KRAS mutant ( KRASm ) colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cell line inhibitor multiple epidermal growth factor receptor ( ErBb ) kinases combination MEK-inhibitor result synthetic lethality . MEK inhibition alone cell result strong feedback activation human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 HER3 48 hour . This enable formation activate complex ErbB family member EGFR , cause primary resistance via subsequent activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway . Concomitant treatment MEK inhibitor multiple inhibitor ErBbs completely suppress feedback activation result cell death . Among various combination , combination afatinib , irreversible EGFR/HER2/HER4 inhibitor , selumetinib , MEK inhibitor , show strong response cell line synergistic induction apoptosis . This effect observe concomitant use intermittent exposure afatinib start 48 hour start exposure selumetinib . In addition observation KRASm CRC cell line , anti-tumor activity combination confirm cell line derive KRASm non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) xenograft mouse KRASm NSCLC cell . Because histology-independent activity concept similarity cancer cell molecular level , combination afatinib selumetinib likely effective pancreatic cancer well . Enhanced antitumor activity combination MEK EGFR inhibitor already establish pancreatic cancer cell line vitro . Therefore plausible combination MEK inhibitor multiple epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor enhance efficacy KRASm driven PIK3CA wildtype pancreatic cancer patient well . Hence , strong rationale combine afatinib selumetinib patient KRASm PIK3CA wildtype ( wt ) CRC , NSCLC , pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
