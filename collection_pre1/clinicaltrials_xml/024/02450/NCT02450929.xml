The protocol originally develop quality assurance project evaluate practice change take place December 1 , 2012 . Data regard postoperative pneumonia relate factor review 18 month prior practice change compare data 14.5 month follow change . Since result may interest wider audience , convert project research study may publish future . The study include data adult patient surgery OHSU June 1 , 2011 February 15 , 2014 . We anticipate enroll approximately 40,000 subject ( least 22,000 pre-intervention group least 16,000 post-intervention group ) . Data gather OHSU electronic medical record system ( Centricity Epic ) . 6 . A multiple logistic regression analysis employ determine rate pneumonia use standard barrel-cuff design ETT Taperguard ETT define group surgical patient . The regression analysis would adjust confound variable include ASA status , age , use paralytic , RSI cricoid pressure , weight , pre-existing lung disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Clinical Evaluation Taperguard Endotracheal Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) common complication tracheal intubation ventilation . The incidence complication poorly define range high 21 % surgical intensive care units.1-4 Efforts reduce event evaluate various endotracheal tube ( ETT ) configuration change clinical practice . Regarding endotracheal tube , use supraglottic suctioning offer patient benefit.5-10 However , definitive benefit supraglottic suctioning exist patient prolonged ventilation11 . While may benefit supraglottic suctioning short period ventilation , low incidence pneumonia group make clinical evaluation less feasible . The Taperguard tubeâ„¢ ( Covidien , Boulder , CO ) design prevent micro aspiration around channel otherwise form barrel-shaped cuff . Laboratory evidence suggest less passage fluid around tube conventional barrel-shaped cuff ( Batchelder , IARS Abstract 2010 ) . Furthermore , clinical model pig suggest less chemical injury aspiration compare barrel shape cuff ( Lichtenthal , Abstract Critical Care 2010 , 14 ( Suppl 1 ) : P229 ) . Human clinical study limit data reduce dye leakage compare barrel-shaped cuff ( Mulier , ASA abstract ; D'Haese Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 2013 ) .12 Currently , evidence patient brief ventilation undergo routine surgery may benefit actual outcome taper shape compare regular tube . Because incidence postoperative pneumonia patient low prolonged ventilation , large clinical data set would necessary evaluate potential difference . Since 2011 , Oregon Health &amp; Science University ( OHSU ) document patient clinical care comprehensive point-of-care electronic medical record system ( Centricity , General Electric , Fairfield , CT ; EPIC , Verona , WI ) . This information collate provide easy access co-morbidities , clinical intervention , ICD-9 discharge code . In addition , OHSU part National Surgical Quality Improvement Project ( NSQIP ) . OHSU collaborator effort since 2006 collect data 1,400 patient annually vascular general surgery patient ( IRB 4621 ) . The identified incidence postoperative pneumonia NSQIP patient OHSU 1.9 % . This incidence slightly national NSQIP average risk-adjusted expect rate postoperative pneumonia . With large surgical population access detailed quality data electronic medical record system , OHSU lend well clinical investigation improve patient care . As investigator , extensive experience management data system detail patient outcomes.13 On December 1 , 2012 , OHSU institute practice change transition endotracheal tube barrel-shaped cuff design Taperguard tube surgical patient . A quality assurance program set monitor patient outcome , include postoperative pneumonia , practice change . The investigator develop protocol expansion quality assurance program , determine practice change affect patient outcomes . This study design chart review collect data adult surgical patient OHSU 18 month prior practice change ( June 1 , 2011 - November 30 , 2012 ) compare data adult patient surgery 14.5 month follow practice change ( December 1 , 2012 - February 15 , 2014 ) . Subjects exclude anesthesia provide use Hi-Lo , double lumen , reinforce , laser endotracheal tube laryngeal mask airway . Data collect OHSU electronic medical record ( Centricity EPIC ) . We gather ICD-9 discharge cod related postoperative pneumonia link pertinent information patient 's anesthesia record , include demographic surgical case information . Postoperative pneumonia define use NSQIP definition ( listed end protocol ) . We anticipate enroll approximately 40,000 subject study . The identified incidence postoperative pneumonia OHSU currently 1.9 % . A power analysis conduct determine meaningful sample size light predict improvement pneumonia outcome . To demonstrate risk reduction 1.9 % 1.5 % 80 % power 0.05 significance , 22,000 patient would need enrolled pre-intervention group 16,000 patient post-intervention group . The primary source data study electronic medical record . The NSQIP database may use comparison verification data collect . During study period , active institutional change address postoperative pneumonia none anticipate near future . Anesthesia techniques undergo major change address pneumonia outcome compliance prophylactic antibiotic administration optimize OHSU . Similarly , intensive care unit implement `` bundle '' practice reduce pneumonia include GI prophylaxis , tracheal suctioning , elevate head bed positioning , sedation vacation spontaneous breathe trial day , target antibiotic therapy . A multiple logistic regression analysis employ determine rate pneumonia use standard barrel-cuff design ETT Taperguard ETT define group surgical patient . The regression analysis would adjust confound variable include ASA status , age , use paralytic , RSI cricoid pressure , weight , pre-existing lung disease . While patient benefit potential reduce micro aspiration may assume preliminary data , additional cost associate new technology warrant without evidence patient care benefit reduce patient care cost . The ultimate outcome desire select endotracheal tube ventilation strategy reduction lung injury , morbidity , reduce cost . Because new technology offer potential benefit , imperative large-scale clinical study confirm hypothesis pneumonia reduce alter cuff design change practice advocate . Estimates cost-savings achieve potential positive data construct . In manner , Taperguard tube potential demonstrate saving hospital improve patient care .</detailed_description>
