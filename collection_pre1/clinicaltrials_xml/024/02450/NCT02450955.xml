	<brief_summary>Objective . To compare benefit spinal manipulation combine massage therapy versus massage alone patient tension-type headache ( TTH ) frequency , intensity disability cause headache cervical range motion . Method . A factorial , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial conduct sample 105 subject diagnose TTH , divide two group : ) treatment group receive manipulative technique follow massage cervical suboccipital region ; ) control group receive massage alone . Four session ( per week ) apply four week . The Headache Disability Inventory ( HDI ) use evaluate change frequency severity headache functional emotional aspect headache . Range upper cervical cervical flexion extension evaluate . Measures conduct baseline , immediately intervention ( week 4 ) follow 8 week completion intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants The sample consist 105 people diagnosed frequent ( 47.6 % ) chronic ( 52.4 % ) TTH derive two primary care centre , select accord criterion IHS3,4 , suffer headache three month . Participants age 18 65 year ( mean ± SD : 38.9 ± 10.9 year ) , include 23 men ( 21.9 % ) 82 woman ( 78.1 % ) . Patients exclude suspect malignant disease , rheumatoid arthritis , pregnancy , vertigo , continuous intake prescribed medication receive physical therapy past 3 month headache neck pain . Finally , 102 subject complete study ( 2 treatment group drop due work problem one control due lack improvement ) . The software G*power14 calculate require sample size , use data previous study estimate effect size expect . Our review extant literature show across study , mean N 44.28 general large effect size find ( Cohen 's = .40 ) .15-19 We accept 5 % alpha risk ( α = .05 ) 10 % beta risk ( β = .1 ) study parameter show 51 subject require group achieve medium-to-large effect size ( f = .35 ) . We predict 5 % dropout rate follow-up period . Study design The study factorial , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial . It conduct January November , 2014 . After initial clinical interview , allocation patient control treatment group randomize external assistant use specific software ( name ) monitor sequence documentation time . Both external assistant therapist examiner blind study objective . Patients randomly assign 2 group ( treatment control ) . The treatment group receive occiput-atlas-axis manipulation ( OAA ) soft tissue treatment massage . The control group receive massage . Thus group receive duration massage therapy exposure time , however difference group lay manipulative OAA technique treatment group receive . Four session conduct ( per week ) assessment carry 3 stage : baseline , end treatment ( 4 week ) follow-up 8 week follow completion treatment . All patient group assess condition treatment examiner blind group allocation . The study conduct University Valencia ( Spain ) January 2014 November 2014 . Prior data collection , inform write consent obtain patient , procedure conduct accord Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
