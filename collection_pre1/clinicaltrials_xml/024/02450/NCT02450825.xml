	<brief_summary>This study design compare three ultrasound-based aeration score previously validate specific population , assess correlation compute tomographic measurement pulmonary aeration population different pathology . Hypothesis : The `` Loss Aeration Score '' accurate simplify version another widely use score , `` Lung Ultrasound Score '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Scores Ultrasound Assessment Monitoring Pulmonary Aeration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment lung aeration may great impact management mechanical ventilation follow-up diverse lung pathology . Computed tomographic scan gold standard method lung aeration measurement rarely use require transport critically ill patient end expose radiation . For reason , lung ultrasound would attractive alternative . Variants different ultrasound-based aeration score validate different specific population , comparison study defines accurate score use population different pathology . Methods : Patients undergo computed tomographic scan dyspnea hypoxemia standardize lung ultrasound examination Day 1 . For mechanically ventilated patient , lung ultrasound examination repeat Day 2 4 . End expiratory lung volume also measure mechanically ventilated patient Day 1 Day 2 4 . Lung ultrasound image interpret blindly . Correlation ultrasound-based aeration score do lung aeration measure computed tomographic image .</detailed_description>
