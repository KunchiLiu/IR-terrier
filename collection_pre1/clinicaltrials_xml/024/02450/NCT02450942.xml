	<detailed_description>In clinical microbiology , pathogenic enterobacteriaceae differentiate organism selectively metabolize sorbitol . They exclusively express enzyme sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , enzyme responsible initiating sorbitol metabolism . 2- [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxysorbitol ( 18F-FDS ) positron-emitting analog sorbitol . The substitution hydroxyl group fluorine C-2 position , however , completely abrogate recognition mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase.18F-FDS could suitable probe selectively label tomographically image enterobacteriaceae vivo . For interest clinical translation 18F-FDS , open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study design investigate radiation dosimetry , plasma pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , safety diagnostic performance 18F-FDS healthy volunteer patient suspected infection . A single dose nearly 370 MBq 18F-FDS intravenously inject healthy volunteer patient suspected infection . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image . Changes blood pressure , pulse , respiration , temperature , routine blood urine test , serum alanine aminotransferase , albumin , creatinine , adverse event collect volunteer . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy volunteer : Males female , ≥18 year old Infectious patient : Males female , ≥18 year old Characteristic clinical sign , symptom laboratory test suggest diagnosis infectious disease . The diagnosis infection base The Centres Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) criteria diagnose infection . They rely combination clinical , radiological , operative , microbiological , histological finding , addition result laboratory test , white blood cell count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C reactive protein value . Females plan bear child recently childbearing potential Renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ( 270 μM/L ) Liver function : hepatic enzyme level 5 time upper limit normal . Known severe allergy hypersensitivity IV radiographic contrast . Patients able enter bore PET/CT scanner . Inability lie still entire imaging time cough , pain , etc . Inability complete need examination due severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease , opinion Investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
