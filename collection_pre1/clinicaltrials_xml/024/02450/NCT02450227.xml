	<detailed_description>Absorption metabolism carotenoid two type spinach preparation investigate two study group , short bowel/ileostomy healthy , respectively . The study conduct randomise , control , 2-way crossover study . Twenty four participant ( 12 group ) randomize two sequence ( 1-2 , 2-1 ) intervention less bio-accessible spinach preparation ( differentiates basis particle size ) . The intervention period sub-divided three part : run-in period ( 48 hour ) standardize low-carotenoid diet , 0-24 hour ( follow-up period 1 ( FP1 ) ) 24 hour - 2 week ( FP2 ) . The intervention period separate wash-out period least 14 day . At start intervention , intervention meal ( breakfast ) serve , follow standardize , carotenoid-free meal follow 24 hour . Participants FP1 FP2 receive intervention meal every second day . Participants otherwise keep habitual diet follow-up period . Study participant ask collect urine 24 hour first intervention meal period . They also collect feces/ileostomy efflux 24 hour initiation intervention short bowel/ileostomy patient 48 period healthy volunteer , respectively . Overnight-fasting serum sample draw day 1 , 7 15 intervention period . On day 1 plasma sample draw 0,1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 24 hour post first intervention meal . Plasma effluent level lutein beta-carotene determined chylomicron also separate sample determination carotenoid . Volunteers also macula examine density yellow spot intervention . Plasma effluent level carotenoid well fat-soluble vitamin also determine . The sample also subject metabolic profiling exploration hypothesis generation .</detailed_description>
