	<brief_summary>Dengue viruses mosquito-borne flavivirus . Each year , dengue virus infect million people throughout tropic subtropics . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine ( V180 ) healthy adult previously receive live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine ( TV003 TV005 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety , Tolerability , Immunogenicity Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine ( V180 ) Healthy Adults Who Previously Received Live-Attenuated Tetravalent Vaccine ( TV003 TV005 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue fever cause one four viral serotypes ( DENV1 , DENV2 , DENV3 , DENV4 ) infection serotype create life-long immunity serotype . V180 experimental tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine would protect four serotypes ( DENV1 , DENV2 , DENV3 , DENV4 ) . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity adjuvanted ( Alhydrogel™ ) nonadjuvanted formulation V180 healthy adult previously receive live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine TV003 TV005 . Participants randomly assign receive one intramuscular injection either adjuvanted V180 , nonadjuvanted V180 , placebo study entry ( Day 1 ) . Participants record temperature adverse event 14 day receive vaccination . Additional study visit occur Days 15 , 28 180 . Visits include physical examination blood urine collection . Study staff contact participant telephone Days 7 90 ( occasional time point Days 90 180 ) health safety follow-up monitoring .</detailed_description>
