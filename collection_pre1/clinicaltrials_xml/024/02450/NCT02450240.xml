	<brief_summary>In study investigator seek improve understanding positive negative valence system , cognition , arousal/interoception inter-related disorder mood , substance use , eat behavior . The investigator recruit 1000 individual use wide range assessment tool , neuroimaging measure , blood microbiome collection behavioral task complete baseline follow-up study visit . Upon completion , investigator aim robust reliable dimensional measure quantify system set assessment recommend clinical tool enhance outcome prediction clinician assist determine likely benefit type intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Latent Structure Multi-level Assessments Predictors Outcomes Psychiatric Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroscience make tremendous progress understand basic neural circuitry underlies important process attention , memory , basic emotion processing . Yet , little progress make utilize insight apply psychiatric population order make clinically meaningful prediction . The connection psychiatric disorder underlie neurobiology difficult establish . The overarch theme study determine biological objective behavioral measure contribute improve assessment treatment psychiatric patient . The investigator use National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) framework heuristic approach integrate neuroscience psychopathology study positive negative valence system , cognition arousal/interoception domain . Within framework study group treatment seek individual mental health condition determine dysfunction affect , substance use , eat behavior organize across different level whether latent factor use generate clinically useful prediction . Using self-report , behavior , physiology , neural circuit , cell , molecule , gene unit analysis measure , investigator propose enroll 1000 individual four different cohort 5 year : ( 1 ) anxiety and/or depression ; ( 2 ) eating problem ; ( 3 ) substance use problem ; ( 4 ) healthy control . Each individual undergo multi-level assessment consist ( ) standardize diagnostic assessment , ( b ) self-report questionnaire , ( c ) behavioral task , ( ) physiological measurement , ( e ) structural functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) EEG , ( f ) biomarker microbiome assessment , ( g ) blood derive induce pluripotent stem cell , ( h ) genetic epigenetic assessment . These individual follow one year re-assessed use multi-domain assessment functioning , include : ( ) symptom severity duration , ( b ) subjective well-being , ( c ) psychosocial function , ( c ) occupational function , ( ) physical health , ( e ) utilization mental health resource ( treatment ) , ( f ) compliance treatment .</detailed_description>
