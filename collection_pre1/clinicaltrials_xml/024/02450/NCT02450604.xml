	<detailed_description>Fabry disease ( FD ) rare X-linked multisytemic lysosomal disorder cause alpha-galactosidase deficiency . Globotriaosylc√©ramide ( Gb3 ) deposit observe almost tissue examine . Signs disease appear earlier severe affected male female . Myocardiopathy , renal failure neurological sign include chronic pain peripheral neuropathy frequent sign . The availability two enzymatic replacement therapy provide specific effective treatment patient . The prevalence FD estimate 1/40,000 1/117,000 . The frequency Fabry disease previously estimate several series patient present one single sign , ie renal failure , hypertrophic myocardiopathy early onset stroke . However , data available prevalence FD population patient suffer chronic pain unknown origin . The diagnosis FD perform standard procedure follow international recommendation . These require search deficiency alphagalactosidase A activity leucocytes male genetic analysis GLA gene female ( Germain et al . 2010 ) . The patient diagnosis FD establish study , call additional visit Investigating Centre order confirm diagnosis propose suitable assessment care .</detailed_description>
