	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect retigabine ( 600 mg/day , 900 mg/day , placebo ) motor neuron activity people Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) . The total study duration approximately 14 week . ALS subject take study drug approximately 10 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Ezogabine ( Retigabine ) ALS Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One major disease feature ALS progressive death motor neuron . Human , rodent stem cell-based model study support hypothesis neuronal hyperexcitability may contribute neurodegeneration sporadic familial ALS . The investigator research study find whether retigabine reduce motor neuron excitability people ALS . investigator also determine whether drug tolerable safe patient ALS . The propose study determine potassium channel opener ezogabine ( retigabine ) affect neurophysiological measure upper low motor neuron excitability ALS patient assess transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) threshold track nerve conduction study ( TTNCS ) , respectively . The study include recruitment approximately 60 unmatched healthy control subject analysis variability neurophysiological test prior recruitment ALS subject . There also 12 match healthy control subject , recruit time ALS subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ALS Subject Male female , age 18 80 . Sporadic familial ALS diagnose possible , laboratorysupported probable , probable , definite define revise El Escorial criterion . Slow vital capacity ( SVC ) measure ≥ 50 % predicted gender , height age Screening Visit , OR opinion SI , ability perform safely complete study visit procedure . Subjects must take riluzole least 30 day , stable dose riluzole least 30 day prior Screening Visit continue stable dose throughout course study ( riluzolenaïve subject permit study ) . Subjects must able swallow oral medication Screening Visit expect able swallow tablet throughout course study . Capable provide informed consent follow trial procedure . Geographically accessible site . Women must able become pregnant ( e.g. , post menopausal , surgically sterile , use adequate birth control method ) duration study three month study completion . Adequate contraception include : abstinence , hormonal contraception ( oral contraception , implanted contraception , inject contraception hormonal contraception , example patch contraceptive ring ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) place ≥ 3 month , barrier method conjunction spermicide , another adequate method . Use medication know affect neurophysiology measure study must schedule , need ( pro nata , PRN ) . A subject must fix dose 30 day prior Screening Visit , must reason believe subsequent change would necessary course study . These medication include : benzodiazepine , muscle relaxant , tricyclic antidepressant , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , hypnotic ( include antihistamine ) anticholinergic . TMS show sufficient MEP amplitude and/or NCS study show sufficient CMAP amplitude . ALS Subject Medical condition , laboratory finding , physical exam find precludes participation . Serum AST ALT value &gt; 2.0 time upper normal limit Clinically significant conduction abnormality electrocardiogram know history cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within past 24 month , congestive heart failure . Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50 mL/min Screening Visit . Concomitant digoxin treatment . Known allergic reaction component study product ( ) . Exposure agent currently investigation treatment patient ALS ( offlabel use investigational ) within 30 day Screening Visit include ezogabine , exposure cell replacement therapy within six month Screening Visit prior intraparenchymal cell replacement injection within spinal cord brain anytime past . Presence tracheostomy Screening Visit . History clinically significant urinary retention , , current use medication treat urinary retention . History drug alcohol abuse within 12 month Screening Visit . The presence unstable psychiatric disease , cognitive impairment , dementia would impair ability subject provide inform consent , accord SI judgment . Clinically significant history unstable severe cardiac , oncologic , hepatic , renal disease , uncontrolled medical condition . Presence feed tube . Current use antipsychotic , antiepileptic ( except benzodiazepine , gabapentin , pregabalin ) class 1 ( e.g . flecainide ) class 3 ( e.g . amiodarone ) antiarrhythmic medication . Quinidine quinidinecontaining drug allow quinidine dose great 20 mg/day ( full list medication , please reference study MOP ) . Inability perform either TMS NCS study due insufficient MEP CMAP amplitude . Pregnant woman woman currently breastfeed . Contraindication TMS study include ferromagnetic metal head neck ( potentially find aneurysm clip , implanted medication pump , implant brain stimulators , pacemaker , cochlear implant ) , history epilepsy . Dental filling permit . Anything else , opinion SI , would place subject increase risk preclude subject 's full compliance completion study . Healthy Control Subject Male female , age 18 80 . Absence known neurological disorder . Capable provide informed consent follow trial procedure . Geographically accessible site . Age ( +/ 10 year sitematched ALS participant within 6 month Baseline visit ) . [ Matched control ] TMS show sufficient MEP amplitude and/or NCS study show sufficient CMAP amplitude ( amplitude define MOP ) . Use medication know affect neurophysiology measure study must schedule , need ( pro nata , PRN ) . A subject must fix dose 30 day prior Screening Visit , must reason believe subsequent change would necessary course study . These medication include : benzodiazepine , muscle relaxant , tricyclic antidepressant , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , hypnotic ( include antihistamine ) anticholinergic . Healthy Control Subject History ALS neurodegenerative disease . Presence positive family history ALS . Current use antipsychotic antiarrhythmic medication Definitely possibly pregnant . Contraindication TMS study include ferromagnetic metal head neck ( potentially find aneurysm clip , implanted medication pump , implant brain stimulators , pacemaker , cochlear implant ) , history epilepsy . Dental filling permit . Anything , opinion SI , would place subject increase risk preclude subject 's full compliance completion study .</criteria>
