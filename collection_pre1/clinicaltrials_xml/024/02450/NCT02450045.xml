	<brief_summary>Hip fracture ( broken hip ) common old people , particularly old woman fragile bone , usually occur simple fall stand height . In Canada , 28,000 hip fracture occur every year , approximately 900 occur Edmonton . After hip fracture , 50 % survive hip fracture recover level activity break hip . Managing pain broken bone important . For patient hip fracture , old age fragile health make pain management even challenge . Many patient hip fracture reduce ability think clearly fracture . Some patient difficulty think hip fracture become confused brief period hip fracture develop permanent difficulty think . A hip fracture usually require operation , choose right pain medication operation important since many pain medication make confusion likely . Permanent difficulty think common reason poor recovery hip fracture . Our study look use nerve block manage pain patient operation . A nerve block provide local pain relief without require patient take medication mouth ( oral ) intravenous ( IV ) route . A nerve block surgery may reduce amount oral IV pain medication need patient operation still provide good pain control less confusion . This could lead good recovery allow patient return live community rather long-term care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale Hip fracture common injury old people , 28,000 hip fracture occur annually Canada . Approximately 900 hip fracture occur Edmonton year . More 90 % hip fracture result simple low-energy fall . Many patient survive recover pre-fracture functional level may require permanent long-term care . The immediate goal treatment control pain prepare patient surgery ; great 95 % hip fracture patient treat surgery restore mechanical stability manage pain . Pain hip fracture associate delirium , depression , sleep disturbance , decreased recovery . However , elderly population , narcotic also associate similar side effect delirium , cardiovascular respiratory depression nausea . This complicate hip fracture patient , pre-existing dementia common - 50 % patient present altered cognition . Most study examine pain management intervention hip fracture exclude pre-existing dementia . Further research determine feasibility include subject cognitive impairment pain management study need . Regional anaesthesia reduce post-operative narcotic use . However , randomized study examine impact preoperative regional anesthesia postoperative outcome . Effective pain management affect long-term outcome : poorly manage pain associate delayed ambulation , pulmonary complication , delay hospital discharge . Our previous work find limited evidence nerve block may benefit hip fracture patient . Other prospective study report effectiveness single nerve block reduce narcotic use Emergency room . Continuous preoperative femoral nerve blockade ( CFNB ) offer potential benefit reduce pain often frail patient well avoid adverse outcome delirium . Further work need determine effectiveness , timing , safety preoperative CFNB preoperative postoperative outcome frail hip fracture population , include cognitive impairment . Study objectives The primary objective determine feasibility definitive randomize control trial ( RCT ) examine effect preoperative CFNB patient hip fracture , include cognitive impairment . Specifically , investigator examine 1 ) Eligibility/recruitment rate ; 2 ) Treatment fidelity ; 3 ) Outcome selection . The secondary objective determine impact pre-operative CFNB patient hip fracture follow outcome within five day surgery : 1 ) Proportion patient delirium duration delirium ; 2 ) Daily pain level ; 3 ) Total narcotic utilization ; 4 ) Proportion patient mobilized postoperative day 1 ; 4 ) Readiness hospital discharge ; 5 ) Complications hospital , include mortality . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize pre-operative CFNB feasible population decrease : delirium frequency / duration , pain , narcotic requirement ; increase number patient mobilized post-operative day 1 ; reduce complication time readiness discharge.Study procedure Research Framework : A complex intervention framework use explore impact preoperative CFNB patient hip fracture preoperative early postoperative outcome . The work propose undertake initial step identify appropriate subject assess feasibility impact intervention . Pilot Study Design : Inception cohort 75 participant use concurrent control group 2:1 allocation intervention control subject . This allow comparison outcome group well sub-analyses within intervention group ( n=50 ) examine treatment fidelity potential confounding . Although investigator may under-powered pilot study , determine number need future RCT . The propose sub-analyses allow u determine cognitive impairment appropriately treat CFNB adequately assess optimal preoperative time frame CFNB apply . Intervention : Subjects score â‰¥13 MMSE , consent participate , recruit within 20 hour ward presentation allocate receive pre-operative CFNB . Twenty hour select maximum time CFNB could delay presentation hospital expect impact pain management base anecdotal experience Acute Pain Service ( APS ) team member . The APS administer CFNB use standardize protocol . Usual Care ( Control group ) : Subjects enrol 20 hour hospital admission ( due delay obtain consent ) allocate control group provide CAM , require ward admission per hip fracture pathway , do within 6 hour ward admission ass baseline delirium . The investigator anticipate selection bias suitable number patient consent 20 hour admission ward occur . Femoral Nerve Blockade : The side hip fracture identify mark . With patient lie supine , groin expose prepared 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate/70 % isopropyl alcohol . A 13-6 MHz high frequency linear ultrasound probe place distal lateral edge femoral crease orientate parallel crease . The probe move medially , inferior parallel femoral crease , identify common femoral artery . The femoral nerve identify lateral artery deep fascia iliaca . Two milliliter 1 % lidocaine infiltrate subcutaneously lateral edge probe use 3 mL syringe 25G needle provide anesthesia skin . A 21G x 95 mm catheter-over-needle assembly insert 'in-plane ' ultrasound probe lateral edge probe direct medially direct visualization target position - deep fascia iliaca , femoral nerve iliopsoas muscle . The spread 5 mL dextrose 5 % water inject needle confirms correct position . The catheter needle remove , first dose 20 mL local anesthetic mixture ( 0.5 % Ropivacaine 0.125 % Bupivacaine ) bolused catheter use syringe . Immediately , catheter secure Tegaderm dress connect infusion pump program deliver continuous 1 mL/hr infusion 4 mL/hr bolus regime 0.2 % Ropivacaine . The infusion/bolus regime continue prior surgery , point , discontinue catheter bolused 20 mL local anesthetic mixture prior catheter removal . Following regional anesthetic intervention , subject return Orthopaedic ward await routine surgical care . Surgery : Surgery within 24-48 hour admission reduces morbidity mortality hip fracture . Over 80 % patient UAH treat within 48 hour admission . Surgical care determine fracture pattern patient factor well perioperative anaesthesia . Study allocation affect surgical priority . Both group receive routine care pre- postoperatively per clinical pathway , aside intervention group receive CFNB preoperatively . Data collection : Baseline data consist demographic ( e.g. , age , gender , residence ) , medical ( cognition ( MMSE ) , delirium ( CAM ) , comorbidities ) data pain use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) without cognitive impairment validate non-verbal pain scale cognitive impairment . Preoperatively , research staff collect narcotic non-narcotic analgesic consumption , CAM score perform shift ( i.e. , 2 times/day ) . Pain rest activity collect two times/day , 9-10 3-4 pm . During weekend hour , APS team collect pain score . Post-operative data collection occur postoperative day 5 discharge , whichever sooner . Delirium pain rest activity assess twice daily per preoperative protocol . Narcotic non-narcotic analgesic utilization record . The research staff record subject first mobilize ( i.e. , get bed ) subject ' readiness discharge ( per clinical pathway ) . Complications also note . Analysis The process evaluation assist determining : 1 ) Recruitment rate : All patient hip fracture admit enrollment period screen determine recruitment rate generalizability cohort ; 2 ) Treatment Fidelity : Defined deliver intervention intend , determine assess ) number Intervention subject receive CFNB prescribe b ) impact time CFNB determine optimal preoperative window CFNB exist , c ) impact cognitive impairment intervention 's effect ability ass outcomes ; 3 ) Outcome Selection : The investigator evaluate follow issue around outcomes- ) select responsive appropriate primary outcome measure , b ) determine appropriate time measure intervention 's impact ( i.e. , single point time impact time ) , c ) comparability verbal non-verbal pain assessment , ) completion rate clinical pathway element . The intervention evaluation determine impact preoperative CFNB compare outcomes group use T-tests repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . Our primary outcome measure evaluation comparison delirium group use CAM . Outcomes The following standardized outcome measure use : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Pain Assessment - Pain rest activity measure use 11-point VAS ( 0-10 ) , reliable valid method measure patient-reported pain . The Checklist Non-verbal Pain Indicators ( CNPI ) show reliable valid non-verbal assessment patient hip fracture cognitive impairment . The Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) able distinguish dementia delirium detect delirium presence dementia . Narcotic Consumption - All narcotic medication record . The total amount narcotic use measure use morphine equivalency scale result equivalent total give single score reflect total narcotic use .</detailed_description>
