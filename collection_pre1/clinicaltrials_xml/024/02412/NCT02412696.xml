	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis whether continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy improve placental histopathology secretory function . The main aim study identify share mechanism obstructive sleep apnea preeclampsia , common highly morbid condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positive Airway Pressure , Sleep Apnea , Placenta ( PAP-SAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit multiple community hospital-based practice care pregnant woman . Subjects give physical exam , measurement take , answer questionnaire screen use home sleep apnea test ( HSAT ) Type III device . Those diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnea randomize one two group ( ) . Both group : 1. blood test placenta-secreted circulate marker 2. placental histopathological immunohistochemistry examination placental expression marker . Both group answer sleep mood questionnaire , blood pressure , blood glucose activity / sleep watch monitoring receive educational session pregnancy health . Randomization group include : 1 . Nasal dilator strip : Participants receive nasal dilator strip monitor need refill supply periodic phone call . 2 . CPAP + nasal dilator strip : Subjects randomize positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy receive auto-titrating PAP . Pressure requirement monitor remotely pressure modify need . PAP adherence determine subjectively objectively . This group also receive nasal dilator strip describe . All subject receive small gift incentive baby-related item . Monetary incentive also issue data collection point .</detailed_description>
