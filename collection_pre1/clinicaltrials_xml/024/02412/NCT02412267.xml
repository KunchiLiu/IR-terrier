	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety ofatumomab combination ICE chemotherapy subject relapsed/refractory DLBCL follow failure combination rituximab anthracycline base chemotherapy . Participants option potentially curative stem cell therapy may proceed high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue . Participants disease consider curable stem cell therapy , ineligible decline stem cell therapy may receive maximum 6 cycle study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ofatumomab Combination With ICE-chemotherapy Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , single-arm , non randomize , safety efficacy study ofatumumab combination salvage ICE chemotherapy ( O-ICE ) 61 subject relapse refractory aggressive B cell lymphoma . O-ICE would administer inpatient . The cycle administer 3 week intervals ICE . Study subject candidate high dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) autologous stem cell rescue ( ASCR ) would receive one two cycle ICE salvage chemotherapy ofatumumab stem cell mobilization . G-CSF 10 ug/kg per day third forth cycle treatment ( discretion treat physician ) would administer end leukapheresis stem cell mobilization . After third forth cycle salvage chemotherapy , leukapheresis initiate collection 5 x 106 CD34 cells/kg white blood 5 procedure perform , whichever occur first . Collection &lt; 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg peripheral blood consider mobilization failure purpose study . Leukapheresis cryopreservation perform accord hospital practice . High dose chemotherapy administer per institution 's protocol . Study subject candidate HDC ASCR would receive 6 cycle salvage chemotherapy ofatumumab . Subjects progress treatment would take study protocol .</detailed_description>
