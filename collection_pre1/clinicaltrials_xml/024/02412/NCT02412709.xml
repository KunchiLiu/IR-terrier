	<detailed_description>Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) genetic disorder characterize prolonged QT interval ECG occurrence syncope , ventricular arrhythmia , sudden death . LQTS major cause sudden death infant , child , young adult . Treatment β-blockers and/or placement implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) effective prevent sudden death , diagnosis LQTS make early . The efficacy ECG screening newborn LQTS demonstrate Italy . Furthermore , within national healthcare system Italy , universal ECG screening newborn ( &lt; 30 day old ) cost-effective . The U.S. debate universal LQTS screening start mid-2000 's . In 2007survey complete North American pediatric cardiologist , 27 % favor optional ECG screening newborn , whereas 11 % support mandatory screening ( 363 response , 35 % response rate ) . There may stronger support universal screening , data available . Obtaining good standard 12-lead EKG neonate clinic difficult time consume . If ECG device newborn screen readily available , reliable , easy use , cost-effective , universal screen 4 million newborn U.S. year would identify 2,000 infant LQTS risk sudden death , assume prevalence Italy . Perhaps 300 death per year SIDS could prevent , well many sudden death child , adolescent , young adult . During Phase I project , new device develop meet clinical need ( call QTScreen ) . In Phase II , aim test capacity QTScreen LQTS screen newborn feasibility home screen parent ethnically diverse population Northern Southern California . The result clinical trial may validate device screen tool LQTS , also provide important scientific data support newborn screen LQTS U.S . The 4 main objective : 1 . To validate capacity QTScreen LQTS screen newborns . This clinical trial 4,000 newborn , conduct Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute ( LABioMed ) . 2 . To determine extent parent able use QTScreen baby home . 3 . To survey end-user experience opinion . The target user QTScreen parent . Participating parent ask complete survey , obtain data development device . 4 . To estimate LQTS prevalence California . To date , population-based estimate LQTS prevalence 1 2,000 Italy . In recent study Japan , 4,285 1-month-old infant ECG screening . The LQTS prevalence report , 10 % subject QTc value &gt; 450 msec gene test . There population-based study LQTS US . In study 707 child hearing loss California , 2 subject potassium voltage-gated channel KQT-like subfamily member 1 ( KCNQ1 potassium channel ) mutation , truncation splicing . This trial provide data LQTS prevalence California . Study Sites : Study procedure conduct subject ' home . Subjects recruit LA BioMed Harbor-UCLA Medical Center , Providence Little Company Mary Medical Center-Torrance , Santa Clara Valley Medical Center , St. Francis Medical Center . Approval recruitment site obtain prior commence recruitment . Consent : Consent seek one parent . Parents give opportunity thoroughly read consent form ask question . Risk/Benefit : ECG routine test perform infant , child adult every day hospital many year problem adverse event . The QTScreen system use study simplify way perform ECG test infant . Some subject may undergo genetic test part research risk associate genetic testing , emotional confidentiality . There small risk infection rash related procedure involve ECG test . The subject may feel discomfort sticky patch place remove his/her chest . Discomfort minimize use adhesive remover wipe commercially available used hospital . Although infection unlikely occur , rule procedure nursery clinic follow . This include clean ECG equipment sanitize use disinfect wipe use prevent infection . The effect draw blood usually pain , bleed and/or bruise needle insert . Occasionally area around vein may swell . Serious complication blood clot infection may occur rare . Some people feel faint blood drawn . Necessary precaution , glove proper sterilization , take minimize pain infection . A small amount local anesthetic cream may place child 's forearm . Appropriate precaution use minimize risk associate project feel general risk associate project low . The information gain study help find way possibly simplify ECG test . This research study may also lead good understand LQTS provide important insight future treatment research . Therefore general feeling benefit project outweigh risk .</detailed_description>
