	<detailed_description>Pulmonary edema ( PE ) underestimate factor wean failure . The interruption mechanical ventilation 1. increase leave ventricular ( LV ) afterload , sympathetic tone may provoke myocardial schema , LV dysfunction 2. augments blood in-flow thorax may cause right ventricular dilation intraventricular septum leave shift . These event may impair LV compliance weaning , increase intra-capillary pulmonary pressure cause cardiogenic PE ( CPE ) . The investigator recently show LV diastolic dysfunction may predispose wean failure , echocardiographic marker CPE may provide insight wean process . Notably , could especially true chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient strategies aim manage heart failure ( i.e . diuretic , nitroglycerin ) show improve wean outcome . In addition , vigorous inspiratory effort endotracheal tube spontaneous wean trial may reduce excessively extracapillary pressure pulmonary interstitial space , cause intra-pulmonary fluid shift know negative pressure PE ( NPPE ) . Primary aim : To study whether echocardiographic parameter leave right ventricular function , echocardiographic surrogate cardiogenic PE ( marker elevate LV filling pressure , E/Em ) associate weaning-induced alteration extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) . Hypothesis A ) Switching positive airway pressure ventilation spontaneous ventilation wean mechanical ventilation , pulmonary edema may occur case , doppler echocardiography ( U/S ) indices cardiac dysfunction correlate concentration fluid interstitial space . B ) These event provoke Maximum Inspiratory Pressure ( MIP ) trial . C ) Pulmonary edema major cause wean failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient , even without know cardiac disease . SUBJECTS Thirty-five consecutive mechanically ventilated critical ill patient fulfil criterion wean , include . METHODS All patient evaluate daily aforementioned wean criterion patient fulfill undergo A ) 2-hour spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) T-piece B ) MIP trial . Before SBT MIP trial cardiopulmonary function assess thermodilution echocardiography . Extravascular Lung Water Index ( EVLWI ) study . EVLWI assess transpulmonary thermodilution ( PiCCO plus system , Pulsion Medical Systems Philips Medical Systems , USA ) . Transpulmonary thermodilution measure left-side CO injection cold injectate ( 15-20 ml,10C lower blood temperature ) via subclavian internal jugular vein detection change temperature arterial system via femoral access . Analysis thermodilution curve term mean transit time ( MTt ) downslope time ( DSt ) use determination intra extra vascular fluid volume . EVLW correlate extravascular thermal volume lung evaluate MTt . Principle parameter obtain transpulmonary thermodilution follow - cardiac output ( absolute/indexed parameter , CO/CI ) - cardiac function index ( CFI ) - extravascular lung water ( EVLW/EVLWI ) - pulmonary vascular permeability index ( PVPI ) - global ejection fraction ( GEF ) Echocardiographic study . Baseline Doppler echocardiographic measurement obtain SBT initiation , participant pressure support ventilation ( pre-SBT ) . Follow measurement ( end-SBT ) patient succeed trial , collect 120 minute SBT initiation . In participant fail procedure , measurement obtain reconnection ventilator . Doppler echocardiography perform previously describe ( Philips i33 , U.S.A. ) . Mitral inflow pulsed-wave Doppler signal [ peak velocity early ( E ) late ( A ) LV diastolic filling , E-wave deceleration time ( DTE ) ] , Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) -derived peak systolic ( Sm ) /early diastolic ( Em ) /late diastolic ( Am ) velocities lateral/septal mitral annulus lateral tricuspid annulus , color M-mode Doppler velocity propagation ( Vp ) obtain apical 4-chamber view . Analysis also perform `` conventional '' ( E/A ratio ) `` advanced '' ( E/Em , ) echocardiographic index LV filling pressure . Expected Results Recruitment period : three month Analysis result : three month Based previous study contact investigator , echocardiographic variable LV diastolic dysfunction expect found associate direct measurement pulmonary edema ( EVLWI ) . In participant preserve LV systolic function , E/Em ratio &gt; 7.8 preform SBT may identify high risk patient increase extravascular water wean . Based preliminary finding EVLWI value measure critical patient investigator 2-11 ml/Kg . The investigator expect find positive correlation ( p &lt; 0.05 ) EVLWI E/Em SBT MIP trial . Implications : The finding study provide insight pathophysiology wean . This could especially true COPD patient failure rate high . Diagnosis wean failure identification patient prone develop LV dysfunction wean wean outcome may improve application strategy aim manage heart failure ( i.e diuretic , nitroglycerin ) . EVLW measurement DE index use aid diagnose determine etiology pulmonary edema critical care patient . These index may retain predictive value even subset patient initially pass SBT ; therefore , E/Em pre-SBT could identify patient probably fail remain SBT . The relationship DE index EVLWI could advantageous compare EVLWI measurement alone , quantification lung edema guidance therapy .</detailed_description>
