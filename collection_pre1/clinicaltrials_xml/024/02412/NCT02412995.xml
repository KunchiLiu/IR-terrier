	<brief_summary>The effect strawberry sea buckthorn postprandial glycaemia insulinemia well metabolic profile examine overweight obese male subject . The study conduct randomise , control , single-blinded , 3-way crossover study . Eighteen subject study three 2 h meal test follow subsequent ad libitum meal . Test meal contain either sea buckthorn , strawberry berry add sucrose match respect sucrose content . Blood sample collect baseline several time postprandially . Subjective appetite sensation record baseline every 15-20 min 140 min subsequent ad libitum intake record . Urine sample also collect baseline several time interval 24 hour . Blood urine subject metabolic profile investigate potential biomarkers berry intake .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Sea Buckthorn Strawberry Postprandial Glycaemia , Insulinemia Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : Berries mix berry product exert acute effect postprandial glycaemia insulinemia , berry study , primarily normal weight subject . Sea buckthorn strawberry compositionally widely different berry may likely produce different response . The effect strawberry sea buckthorn postprandial glycaemia insulinemia examine overweight obese male subject . Subjective appetite sensation ad libitum intake also examine . Berries may thus improve health long study ; however , accurate assessment berry intake still problematic . The discovery objective biomarkers intake berry therefore important assess intake compliance . The investigator aim identify urinary exposure marker two different berry , strawberry sea buckthorn , human . Methods : The study conduct randomise , control , single-blinded , 3-way crossover study . Eighteen subject study three 2 h meal test follow subsequent ad libitum meal . Test meal contain either sea buckthorn , strawberry berry add sucrose match respect sucrose content . Blood sample collect = 0 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 min . Subjective appetite sensation record = 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 140 min subsequent ad libitum intake record . Statistical difference continuous measure evaluate base existence meal time-meal interaction repeat measurement analysis difference area curve ( AUC ) measure linear mixed model . Urine sample collect test day t=-15min , t=0-1h , t=1-2h , t=2-24h analyze untargeted metabolomics . Multivariate analysis apply discover marker , follow molecular fragmentation ease chemical identification .</detailed_description>
