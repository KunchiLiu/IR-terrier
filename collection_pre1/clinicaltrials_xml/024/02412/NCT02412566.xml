	<brief_summary>While fish-oil lipid emulsion show benefit treatment parenteral nutrition ( PN ) -associated cholestasis , dose limit 1 g/kg/day . Similarly , early PN-associated cholestasis dose soy-based lipid limit 1 g/kg/day . Often calories lose relative decrease dose lipid provide adjust dextrose content PN solution provide high glucose infusion rate . In case , tolerate even maximize strategy , growth inadequate . Inadequate growth direct cause poor outcome include poor neurological outcome , failure able stop mechanical ventilation poorer growth often already damage intestine . These outcome lead severe disability death . Therefore , infant receive 1 g/kg/day lipid adequately grow must great intake lipid meet need weight , length , head circumference growth . SMOFlipid ( Fresenius Kabi , Bad Homburg , Germany ) contain mixture 4 different lipid source : soybean oil provide essential fatty acid , olive oil rich monounsaturated fatty acid less susceptible lipid peroxidation polyunsaturated fatty acid , medium-chain triglyceride show faster metabolic clearance long-chain triglyceride , fish oil supply omega-3 fatty acid . It safe give usual dose lipid therapy neonates 3 g/kg/day , rather limit 1 g/kg/day cholestatic infant receive Omegaven soy lipid . Because product include omega-6 omega-3 lipid , provide benefit omega-3s liver provide enough omega-6s meet essential fatty acid requirement . Its use situation growth inadequate baby must restrict 1 g/kg/day expect improve growth likely markedly increase chance good neurological outcome survival . Purpose : We want find new intravenous fat mixture ( SMOFlipid ) help promote good growth reduce severity ( seriousness ) liver disease help put end liver disease infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Therapy SMOFlipid provide target dose 3 gm/kg/day ( continuous infusion ) . SMOFlipid initiate advanced accord follow guideline : Day 1 - provide 1 g/kg ; Day 2 - provide 2 g/kg ; Day 3 - provide 3 g/kg . SMOFlipid infuse intravenously either central peripheral catheter conjunction parenteral nutrition . The standard care provide patient receive parenteral nutrition ( PN ) solution follow . Essential fatty acid level measure 4 12 week initiation SMOFlipid . This time frame use assess essential fatty acid inpatient outpatient . These lab clinically indicate ; therefore , record result total fatty acid lipid profile panel medical record case report form . Patients remain SMOFlipid weaned PN . In event patient list liver liver/intestinal transplant organ become available , participation protocol preclude receive transplant . SMOFlipid administer post transplant . If infant long require PN , SMOFlipid stop regardless bilirubin . If bilirubin less 2 mg/dL child still require PN , SMOFlipid continue infant long require PN . The reason stop SMOFlipid infant longer require PN would reason many infant would still need IV access therefore risk maintain IV access medication likely exceed benefit SMOFlipid point . Babies receive SMOFlipid preclude receive Omegaven per compassionate use protocol ( H-23365 ) meet inclusion criterion protocol .</detailed_description>
