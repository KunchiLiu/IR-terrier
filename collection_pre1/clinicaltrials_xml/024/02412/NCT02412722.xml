	<detailed_description>The drug test study call MLN0128 . MLN0128 test assess safety tolerability administer alone combination paclitaxel people nonhematologic malignancy . MLN0128 also test characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) property ( process body ) administer high-fat meal compare empty stomach . This study look side effect lab result people take MLN0128 without paclitaxel . This open label study enroll approximately 32 patient . Participants receive MLN0128 participate 6-day PK Run-In Period MLN0128 4 mg capsule administer fasted condition Days 1 4 , high-fat breakfast Day 3 . The main treatment period begin within 14 day Day 6 PK Run-In Period . In main treatment period participant receive MLN0128 4 mg daily 28-day Cycle 12 Cycles . Participants treatment arm receiving MLN0128 paclitaxel PK Run-In Period receive MLN0128 6 mg daily Days 2-4 , 9-11 , 16-18 , 23-25 28-day Cycle 12 Cycles paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 intravenously ( IV ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day Cycle , 12 Cycles . The dose MLN0128 may modify base safety tolerability 28-day cycle either treatment arm . This multi-centre trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 14 month . Participants MLN0128 arm make 32 visit clinic participant MLN0128 paclitaxel arm make 26 visit clinic . All participant make final visit clinic 30 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
