	<detailed_description>Subgroups patient radically operate colorectal cancer well prognosis six month treat chemotherapy . This beneficial effect may enhance somewhat provide combination chemotherapy addition oxaliplatin . It known treatment addition increase risk neurotoxic side effect sensitivity cold , numbness tingle hand foot , muscle cramp , pain , taste disorder swallow difficulty . A study patient ' experience neurotoxic symptom impact daily life . The operative treatment colorectal cancer surgery . The possibility curative resection factor strongly associate patient 's survival . High-risk patient metastasis contraindication surgery primary tumor , individual patient 's benefit surgery must especially value . If primary tumor cause troublesome symptom , metastasis organ , treat non-surgical method , tumor leave initially remove later symptoms occur . For rectal cancer radiation therapy topical reduces risk local recurrence . In locally advanced cancer radical resection possible , radiation therapy , without chemotherapy , current order achieve tumor-killing effect infiltration zone . Radiation therapy cause acute chronic complication , pain , faecal incontinence sexual dysfunction may affect patient ' quality life . At advanced radically operate colorectal cancer commonly advise chemotherapy . The goal give chemotherapy , possible , prevent micrometastasis may exist patient , even though patient manage radical surgery . Colorectal cancer spread primarily lymph node liver , also bloodstream lung , brain bone . Choice chemotherapy influence several factor , include tumor extent , time primary diagnosis , previous treatment give , symptom , performance status , concomitant disease , blood test patient 's attitude towards readiness accept side effect . Treatment intention curative , palliative prophylactic ( adjuvant ) . There mainly three type chemotherapy use treat colorectal cancer . They individual , usually provide combination . They give multiple line , mean combination administer initially change another combination poor tolerance treatment failure . Most patient get two three line treatment . Intended provide combination therapy increase efficacy tumor , reduce risk resistance develop spread side effect . The effect particular treatment best earlier give may meaningful even later stage . A cornerstone treatment five decade , 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , colorectal cancer , combination folinic acid ( leucovorin ) . This regime relatively lowtoxic patient capable treatment without severe side effect . Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) another treatment regimen , often preferred patient give orally usually mild side effect . Another treatment option give oxaliplatin addition 5-flurouracil , leucovorin capecitabine ( FOLFOX 4 , PHLOX , XELOX ) . These combination trial prolong survival compare 5-flurouracil leucovorin . Oxaliplatin reduce risk relapse 25 percent comparison 5FU/leukovorin . This regimen pose increase proportion neurotoxic side effect result . Chemotherapy generally provide number unpleasant sometimes life-threatening side effect . Side effect may occur symptom nausea , vomit , diarrhea , anemia , skin lesion mouth blow . This result nutritional difficulty , reduce strength impair immune system increase risk infection . The fact patient inform cancer diagnosis strain patient also relatives . This may mean ordinary life change normal daily activity perform previously hospitalization , surgical oncological treatment . As far quality life include experience health welfare patient base physical , psychological social need . It may also include economic , political , spiritual need . The concept health-related quality life suit context disease symptom affect individual 's physical function . Possible treatment side effect affect individual 's ability function . Health-related quality life individual experience vary individual . In case valuable view treatment result patient important role . Patients disease read experience advantage disadvantage ( side effect ) treatment . By measure patient ' health-related quality life possible create picture patient 's perspective illness treatment . Sense Of Coherence ( SOC ) Antonovsky divide three key component : comprehensibility , manageability meaningfulness . Antonovsky argue degree SOC affect person 's ability handle stressful situation . Studies show psychological stress negative impact quality life patient various type cancer , study show applies colorectal cancer patient . But cancer patient ' personality affect perceive quality life know . Several psychological personality factor play central role disease process . A strong sense coherence health-stimulating factor study cancer patient result reduced mortality , disease progression resignation . The cancer involve patient extensive psychological stressful situation , patient 's capacity adapt influence defense . The validated instrument SOC ( Sense Coherence ) able measure patient ' sense coherence . Neurotoxic side effect often occur treatment oxaliplatin . Oxaliplatin cause acute delay neuropathy . Studies show patient persistent chronic problem . Acute neurotoxicity usually half hour hour start infusion disappear day , often arrive dos . These symptom present paresthesia , cold intolerance , pain eye jaw , abdominal pain , cramp legs calf , numbness tingle hand , foot around mouth voice vision change . Side effect reduce within 14 day permanent nerve damage lead difficulty write , walk , swallow carry daily activity . Permanent damage may occur without acute side effect initial stage . It important especially second half treatment period , observe sign neurotoxic symptom consist therapy . Studies show neurotoxic effect greatly affect long treatment last . If patient side effect oxaliplatin reduce excluded fear debilitate prolong neuropathy . The drug-specific questionnaire Oxaliplatin-Specific Neurotoxicity Scale accurate instrument measure neurotoxic symptom . The instrument divide three part : upper extremity , low extremity mouth / facial region . Symptoms estimate precede cycle therapy grade base whether symptom exist . If patient symptom , grade 1-5 . Patients also rate extent symptom affect daily live activity 1-5 . It important note early neurotoxic effect encourage patient report symptom arise . Information treatment start side effect might arise patient detect early symptom significant . Patients neuropathy upper extremity experience difficulty fasten button , zip close , write , sew housework , unlike patient low neuropathy difficulty driving , walking , train carry activity ( balance ) . The perceived disability cause feeling anxiety , depression , frustration , anger difficulty adapt situation may also affect social interaction . The aim investigate colorectal cancer patient oxaliplatin adjuvant chemotherapy experience neurotoxic effect experience symptom change time treatment symptom affect patient ' daily life quality life .</detailed_description>
