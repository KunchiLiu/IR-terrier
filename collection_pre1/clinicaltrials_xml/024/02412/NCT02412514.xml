	<brief_title>Intestinal Humoral Immunity Sequential Polio Vaccination Schedules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal polio vaccination protect individual paralytic disease ( humoral immunity ) prevent transmission poliovirus ( intestinal immunity ) . Inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) induce humoral ( systemic ) immunity three type poliovirus ( 1 , 2 3 ) , protect individual develop paralytic polio expose wild type poliovirus . However , induces little intestinal immunity . Intestinal immunity inhibits poliovirus replication thereby reduce quantity duration poliovirus excretion stool . This critical preventing spread poliovirus others . Oral polio vaccine live attenuate vaccine trivalent OPV ( tOPV ) mixture poliovirus strain type 1 , 2 3 . Like IPV , OPV induce humoral immunity effective IPV induce intestinal immunity . In develop country , routine childhood immunization poliovirus consist three dos tOPV 6 , 10 14 week age may also include birth dose tOPV . An important limitation vaccine virus OPV mutate acquire neurovirulence cause paralysis either due vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) due circulate vaccine-derived poliovirus ( cVDPVs ) , attenuate vaccine virus acquire ability cause paralysis also circulate similarly wild poliovirus ( WPV ) . The potential vaccine virus acquire neurovirulence cause paralytic poliomyelitis incompatible eradication polio . Therefore , polio eradication require eventual cessation OPVs . The last case WPV type 2 report 1999 India . Type 2 vaccine virus tOPV likely cause cVDPVs 80 % cVDPVs past decade cVDPV2 . Of estimate 250-500 annual VAPP case , almost 40 % due type 2 . Thus , eradication WPV2 imperative prioritize removal type 2 contain OPV . The licensing availability bOPV contain type 1 3 offer option OPV contain OPV2 . In April 2013 , Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization ( SAGE ) recommend phased cessation OPVs start switch tOPV bOPV . After switch , bOPV expect administer 6 , 10 14 week age , typical routine poliovirus immunization schedule develop country tOPV . Additionally , least one dose IPV recommend prevent rapid rise type 2 susceptibility birth cohort bear switch bOPV . The Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) advocate administration least one dose IPV delay dose 14 week age decrease interference maternal antibody provide high seroconversion possible single dose IPV Expanded Program Immunization ( EPI ) schedule . The GPEI position introduce one dose IPV 14 week age principally base finding trial Cuba report type 2 seroconversion 63 % single dose IPV give 16 week age . The current schedule Bangladesh tOPV 6 , 10 14 week age IPV also 14 week age . As result addition IPV routine immunization schedule , child receive four dos polio vaccine ( three bOPV one IPV ) four dos necessary ? Could IPV administer reduced number bOPV dos still lead protective level humoral intestinal immunity ? Previous study US UK suggest two dos OPV give one two dos IPV induces protective level humoral intestinal immunity comparable three dos tOPV . Furthermore , recent study Bangladesh find significant difference type 1 3 seroconversion proportion among child three-dose bOPV schedule versus fractional IPV ( f-IPV ) /bOPV schedule ( two f-IPV , one bOPV ) . Although significant difference vaccine virus excretion among child receive bOPV compare f-IPV/bOPV type 1 3 , difference could diminish second dose bOPV give instead f-IPV . In addition , interest whether VAPP-protective schedule could mount protective level immunity individual . A VAPP-protective schedule administration IPV first dose poliovirus vaccination . The risk VAPP high first dose OPV diminishes subsequent OPV administration . There risk VAPP IPV give first dose vaccine use kill virus . The rationale behind VAPP-protective schedule individual would prior exposure type 1 , 2 , 3 IPV first bOPV administration , thereby decrease risk VAPP . Investigators trial ass reduce number bOPV dose give dose IPV confers protective level immunity polio examine intestinal humoral immunity induce two different bOPV/IPV VAPP-protective sequential schedule among infant Bangladesh . Specially , investigator examine proportion seroconversion vaccine virus excretion child receive IPV dose 6 week age bOPV 6 , 10 14 week age comparison child receive IPV dose 6 week age bOPV 10 14 week age . Setting : Mirpur suburb Dhaka population one million area 59 square kilometer . Mirpur Thana Dhaka city divide 14 section . Mirpur 8 kilometer icddr , b 's Dhaka Hospital .</detailed_description>

Parents infant unable participate full length study . A diagnosis suspicion immunodeficiency disorder either infant immediate family member . A diagnosis suspicion bleed disorder would contraindicate parenteral administration IPV collection blood venipuncture . Acute diarrhea , infection illness time enrollment ( 6 week age ) would require infant 's admission hospital would contraindicate provision OPV per country guideline . Acute vomit intolerance liquid within 24 hour enrollment visit ( 6 week age ) . Receipt polio vaccine ( OPV IPV ) enrollment base upon documentation parental recall . Known allergy/sensitivity reaction polio vaccine content polio vaccine . Infants multiple birth . Infants multiple birth exclude reduce potential contact transmission vaccine poliovirus sibling . The infant ( ) multiple birth is/are enrol would likely receive routine immunization transmit vaccine poliovirus enrol infant . Infants premature birth ( &lt; 37 week gestation ) .</criteria>
