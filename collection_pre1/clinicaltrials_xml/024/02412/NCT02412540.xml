	<brief_summary>The goal study determine effective treatment identify diagnostic biomarkers Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Individuals take part study participate either weight loss surgery ( WLS ) group comprehensive lifestyle intervention ( CLI ) group . People WLS group receive vertical sleeve gastrectomy ( VSG ) . The CLI group receive dietary , activity behavioral intervention provide trained study staff .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Trial WLS vs. CLI Severely Obese Adolescents With NASH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator design rigorously control study design evaluate NASH outcome two parallel cohort : 1 ) severely obese adolescent NASH chosen undergo WLS ( specifically VSG ) clinical indication compare 2 ) control group severely obese adolescent NASH enrol CLI offer part study . The study provide best evidence date effectiveness WLS CLI treat NASH adolescent body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 35 kg/m2 . The investigator also concurrently collect health-care utilization data enable subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) evaluate cost-effectiveness WLS vs. CLI intervention severely-obese adolescent NASH . If investigator ' data support hypothesis WLS yield superior result , set stage randomized study ( need ) translational study weight loss-independent biological mechanism ( ) unique WLS , may include specific change bile acid signal intestinal microbiome . The latter would facilitate develop novel pharmacotherapies accessible young less obese child NASH WLS applicable . Cumulatively , study potential yield significant improvement medical quality life ( QOL ) outcomes large proportion pediatric patient NASH reduce long term health care cost identify effective treatment option decrease progression cirrhosis end-stage liver disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adolescents age 1319 year ( range define World Health Organization ) . BMI ≥ 35 60 kg/m2 ( minimum BMI per current guideline WLS adolescent ) . An upper limit BMI set avoid rare outlier BMI . Meet current standard care eligibility criterion adolescent WLS . Liver biopsy clinical indication evaluate NASH within 90 day enrollment . Biopsy must confirm definite borderline NASH minimum histological NASH Activity Score ≥ 3 . No evidence liver disease history , screen test histological evaluation . Written inform consent parent/legal guardian inform assent adolescent Evidence chronic liver disease : autoimmune hepatitis ; hepatitis B ; hepatitis C ; hemochromatosis ; alpha1antitrypsin ( A1AT ) deficiency ; Wilson disease ; use medication know cause fatty liver &gt; 2 consecutive week past year ( i.e . systemic glucocorticoid , tetracycline , anabolic steroid , valproic acid ) ; alcohol intake &gt; 10 gm/day female &amp; &gt; 20 gm/day male . Noncompensated liver disease follow : hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL ; white blood cell count &lt; 3,500 cells/mm3 , platelet count &lt; 130,000 cells/mm3 blood , direct bilirubin &gt; 1.0 mg/dL , total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL , albumin &lt; 3.2 g/dL , international normalize ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.4 Active psychiatric disorder would prevent eligibility WLS impede adherence CLI , include clinically significant depression ( hospitalization suicidal ideation ) past 12 month . Any medical condition prevent eligibility WLS include limited micronutrient deficiency ( e.g . iron ) refractory medical therapy inflammatory bowel disease . Poorly control Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) define hemoglobin A1C ( HgbA1c ) &gt; 9 % . Use high dose vitamin E ( &gt; 400 IU per day ) medication could alter NASH histology time within 3 month prior baseline liver biopsy trial . Inability failure provide inform assent/consent Current enrollment another clinical trial receipt investigational study drug within 6 month prior baseline liver biopsy Any female currently nursing , plan pregnancy , know suspected pregnant , positive pregnancy screen Inability travel study site interval necessary clinical intervention ( CLI WLS ) . Prior history WLS .</criteria>
