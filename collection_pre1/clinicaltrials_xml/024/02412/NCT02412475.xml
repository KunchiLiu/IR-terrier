	<brief_summary>Successful treatment child young adult relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) continue significant challenge . Despite relative improvement survival patient newly diagnose AML , estimate 40-60 % relapse majority eventually die relapse disease . Attaining subsequent remission patient relapse initial critical step toward achieve potential cure . As chemotherapy resistance one primary driver poor treatment response subsequent relapse AML , identify method reverse resistance desperately need . This clinical trial aim improve remission re-Induction rate child adult relapse refractory AML epigenetic modifying agent ability reverse chemotherapy resistance . Decitabine , DNA methyltransferase inhibitor ( DNMTi ) Vorinostat , histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) , two epigenetic modify drug act methylation proximal promoter region gene protein involve wrap DNA around histone , respectively . Both process play critical role regulate gene expression , frequently gene involve chemotherapy resistance . These agent FDA-approved treatment adult hematologic malignancy , make opportune time begin test novel therapy pediatric leukemia trial . This study investigate chemotherapy prim relapsed/refractory AML use Decitabine Vorinostat give 5 day prior standard re-Induction Fludarabine , Cytarabine G-CSF child adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1 Study Number Patients : 12 24 evaluable subject require enroll subject 4 dose level . Study Objectives : Primary Objectives - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) decitabine use combination vorinostat , fludarabine , high dose cytarabine G-CSF ( FLAG ) child young adult relapse refractory AML . - To evaluate ability safely deliver combination decitabine vorinostat follow fludarabine , high dose cytarabine G-CSF ( FLAG ) pediatric young adult patient relapse refractory AML . Secondary Objectives To establish extent hypomethylation peripheral blood ( PB ) bone marrow ( BM ) pre- post- decitabine vorinostat treatment : LINE-1 methylation assay surrogate marker global DNA methylation . Direct Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis Gene expression profile assess genetic change - To analyze correlation DNA methylation gene expression pre- post-treatment decitabine vorinostat . - To analyze correlation biological change clinical response Selection Study Patients : • Study entry open patient regardless gender ethnic background . While every effort seek include female minority patient , patient population expect different acute leukemia study Medical College Wisconsin .</detailed_description>
