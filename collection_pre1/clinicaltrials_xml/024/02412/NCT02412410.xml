	<detailed_description>Each ten physician work laborist shift ask wear actigraphy watch ( ReadiBand- Fatigue Science , Vancouver , BC ) continually three week winter 2014-2015 initial data collection . A brief sleep education intervention base aerospace military fatigue countermeasure train give one hour departmental grand round presentation April 20 , 2015 . This intervention base ACGME requirement fatigue education resident also address late data sleep health , well fatigue countermeasure nap recommendation , sleep banking , sleep hygiene . An additional two week data collect . Data de-identified enter Fatigue Science algorithm , validate detect sleep quantity quality . This algorithm allow label data reflect type shift , well sequence schedule . For example , sleep/wake cycle fourth night shift series identify , wakefulness fourth night shift artificially compare wakefulness first night night shift . Average efficacy type shift , well average efficacy shift series one type shift calculate . Efficacy report percentage , base nomogram establish military wakefulness task exercise validate correlate blood alcohol level likelihood human factor accident risk Department Defense , US Army , US Navy , US Marine Corps , Federal Railroad Association . Calculated data shift efficacy significantly contribute grow literature strength laborist model , help internal schedule structure continue maximize efficacy . As laborist program develop expand , investigator may also forerunners describe optimal schedule staff program similar size scope . Ultimately , additional study use innovative technology elucidate assume scientifically establish relationship sleep/wake base cognitive efficacy patient safety superimpose investigator ' wakefulness data investigator ' tracked adverse event . This would landmark investigator ' field potential effect groundbreaking safety measure investigator ' training staffing .</detailed_description>
