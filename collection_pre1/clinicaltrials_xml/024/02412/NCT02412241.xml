	<brief_summary>This four-year , prospective , longitudinal study evaluate validate patient-reported outcome measure , clinician-reported outcome measure , image technique assess characteristic , trajectory , progression lymphedema fibrosis ( LEF ) oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer patient . This clinical trial study patient-and-clinician-reported measure well standard image method see accurate identify evaluate lymphedema ( swell ) fibrosis ( tough tight tissue ) head neck region patient receive treatment newly diagnose stage II-IV oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer . Lymphedema fibrosis ( LEF ) lead physical symptom , trouble swallow chewing , well psychological emotional symptom , negative body image avoid social interaction . Finding accurate test identify evaluate LEF may allow doctor treat LEF quickly control symptom effectively , thus provide patient good quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishing Lymphedema Fibrosis Measures Oral Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose study establish valid , clinically useful measurement battery head neck LEF achieve specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine reliability validity patient-reported outcome measure ( LSIDS-H &amp; N ) assess LEF-related symptom oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer patient across trajectory treatment , recovery , survival . Aim 2 : To determine reliability validity clinician-reported outcome measure ( HN-LEF Grading Criteria Modified Patterson Scale ) assess external internal LEF oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer patient across trajectory treatment , recovery , survival . Aim 3 : To determine reliability validity image technique ( CT scan ultrasonography ) identify site-specific LEF oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer patient across trajectory treatment , recovery , survival .</detailed_description>
