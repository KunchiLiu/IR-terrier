	<brief_summary>This study evaluate transfusion fresh frozen plasma contain enzyme PAPP-A2 female adult . This female adult mutate version PAPP-A2 prevents unbind IGF-1 IGF binding protein . The investigator 's hypothesize transfusion plasma donor PAPP-A2 lead unbind IGF-1 binding protein able measure free IGF-1 blood female adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pappalysin 2 ( PAPP-A2 ) Enzyme Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAPP-A2 plasma protease know cleave IGFBP-3 IGFBP-5 . It think cleavage free IGF-1 bound form allow become active free IGF-1 . The participant short stature accompany elevate plasma level IGF-1 IGF bind protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) . Genetic analysis participant identify novel missense mutation PAPPA2 ( Ala1033Val ) . This gene perfect candidate explain patient ' phenotype . The investigator ' hypothesis loss activity PAPP-A2 lead inability cleave IGF bind protein thus overall elevation IGFBP-3 consequent elevation total IGF-1 . However , IGF-1 free thus able active lead short stature . The patient 's missense variant predict damaging silicon prediction model Polyphen2 . Furthermore , two knock mouse model PAPPA2 well zebrafish knock exist , show growth retardation ( post-natally mouse ) . Taken together , definitive evidence patient ' mutation PAPPA2 responsible short stature phenotype .</detailed_description>
