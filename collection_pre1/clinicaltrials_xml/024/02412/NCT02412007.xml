	<brief_title>Individualized Comprehensive Home-Centred Activity Based Therapy Children With Diplegic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study setting : This study conduct child enrol Outpatient Clinic Department Pediatrics , Post Graduate Institute Medical Education Research , Chandigarh associate Outpatient Department PRAYAAS ( A project Indian Council Child Welfare ) locate Dakshin Marg , Sector 38 B , Chandigarh rehabilitation centre child cerebral palsy neurology unit department provide outreach service . Study Period : Oct 2014 Dec 2015 Study population : Consecutive child 5 12 yr age diagnose spastic diplegic cerebral palsy ( per standard definition ) bring Outpatient Clinic Department Pediatrics , Post Graduate Institute Medical Education Research , Chandigarh associate Outpatient Department PRAYAAS locate Dakshin Marg , Sector 38 B , Chandigarh . Sample Size : Keeping Î±=0.05.Power=80 % Assumption : The intervention result 60metres change distance cover . S.D . previous study ( Gross Motor Function Classification System ) GMFCS II =77 Hence , would need 27 child group . Assuming loss follow-up 5 patient , target sample size 59.Therefore would require 30 patient per group . Study design : Endpoint : Efficacy , Feasibility Intervention model : Parallel group assignment Primary Purpose : Physiotherapy Masking : Intervention - Open label Outcome assessment- Blinded Assessment Data- Blinded Eligibility All child age 5 12 year diagnose spastic diplegic cerebral palsy eligible enrolment study . For study , spastic diplegia would include bilateral motor impairment affect low extremity upper extremity objective clinical sign hyperreflexia spasticity . Primary Outcome variable At six month Change distance cover measure 6 minute walk test ( metre ) Secondary Outcome variable : At three month six month 1 . Change Modified Ashworth Scale Scores 2 . Change Modified Tardieu Scale Scores 3 . Change 10metre fast walk score ( second ) 4 . Change GMFM D &amp; E Scores . 5 . Change Cerebral Palsy Quality Life ( CPQoL ) ( Primary Caregiver ) Scores At three month Change distance cover measure 6 minute walk test ( metre ) Methodology : Patient flow Consecutive child sex 5-12 year clinical diagnosis spastic cerebral palsy examine investigator meeting inclusion criterion would enrol study.An inform consent would take parent guardian prior enrollment study . Clinical demographic data record structured Performa child include age , sex , weight , detailed antenatal birth history , complication prenatal neonatal period , detailed developmental history , family history neurological condition presence know comorbidity cerebral palsy . Randomization Children would randomize two group use randomization table . They would classify either Group A Group B Intervention Group A Children include Group A would advise carry individualized comprehensive home centre activity base programme . The investigator would interact primary care-giver record parent 's anticipated goal term child 's low limb functioning ; specifically gait , spasticity daily functioning . The child would clinically examine thoroughly see impairment . Subsequently comprehensive individualize activity base programme decide upon discussion investigator , physiotherapist occupational therapist primary care-giver acceptable feasible perform home resource limit setting . The programme would include simple activity would advise basis child 's individual characteristic parental expectation . These would include would limited 1 . Standing squat position catch object interest . 2 . Squatting stand position pick object interest . 3 . Walking reach object interest . 4 . Climbing step get object interest . 5 . Climbing step keep object interest . 6 . Cycling 7 . Kicking football 8 . Dancing The total duration activity would one hour start could repeat three time day . The frequency activity would least five day week . Parents would advise case child acute illness , fever , muscle pain , withhold session seek early medical consultation PGIMER contact investigator advice . Group B Children include Group B would continue receive rehabilitative measure already form conventional physiotherapy would include would limited 1 . Passive stretching exercise spasticity reduction 2 . Gait exercise 3 . Walking treadmill 4 . Lower limb strengthen exercise 5 . Exercises balance improvement No extra intervention would advise group part study . At completion study , comprehensive individualize home-centred activity base therapy find efficacious , offered child classify Group B . Follow-up Schedule All child would follow set interval initiation therapy note : 1 . Two week ( telephonic/home visit ) 2 . Three month : Physical follow-up 3 . Six month : Physical follow-up The first visit would primarily aim reinforce technique therapy clarify parent 's doubt . Compliance would assess review write log activity do home . At three-month visit child would clinically examine follow record make : ( ) 6 minute walk score ( metre ) ( b ) Modified Ashworth Score ( b ) Modified Tardieu Score ( c ) 10metre fast walk score ( metre ) ( ) GMFM D Score ( e ) GMFM E Score ( f ) CPQoL ( Primary Care giver ) Score At six-month visit child would clinically examine follow record make : 1 . Modified Ashworth Score 2 . Modified Tardieu Score 3 . 10metre fast walk score ( metre ) 4 . GMFM D Score 5 . GMFM E Score 6 . CPQoL ( Primary Caregiver ) Score Statistical Analysis Statistics : Data record would do Microsoft Excel spreadsheet ( Microsoft Office , Microsoft Corp. , Seattle , WA , USA ) . ( ) Descriptive : Mean/Median/Range/Standard Deviation/Frequencies would use describe demographic profile patient comorbidities . ( iii ) Comparative : Appropriate test would employ Ethical justification The study consist comparative analysis effect conventional physiotherapy comprehensive individualize home-centred activity-based programme child spastic diplegia . All child would examine detail either intervention would advise random selection . Both intervention beneficial hence every child enrol would benefit . The child would evaluate co-morbidities appropriate therapy advise need . This study would beneficial long term design recommend effective exercise programme spastic diplegics . No additional investigation do purpose study . Parents privilege withdraw child study point study period . This way affect standard protocol management child . Children enrol study would benefit undergoing comprehensive standardize evaluation disability get benefit regular rehabilitative programme .</detailed_description>
