	<brief_summary>There limited evidence community-based intervention guide development effective maternal , perinatal newborn care practice service develop country . Investigators plan evaluate impact low-cost package community-based intervention implemented government sector lady health worker ( LHWs ) community health worker ( CHWs ) NGO namely Aga Khan Health Services perinatal neonatal outcome sub-population remote mountainous district Gilgit , Northern Pakistan . A community-based package use LHWs CHWs gear towards prevention promotion maternal newborn health practice service develop base formative research study district . The package include promotion antenatal care , adequate nutrition , skilled delivery healthy newborn care practice household level . The health worker train recognition danger sign warrant referral health care service . LHWs CHWs deliver package via community awareness session two one-to-one counsel session pregnant woman third trim five newborn assessment visit neonatal period . In addition , community mobilization activity include formation CHCs creation support uptake intervention . Control area continue receive routine standard health service governmental non-governmental organization area . The intervention area receive intervention package addition routine standard health service .

	<brief_title>Community-based Perinatal Newborn Care Gilgit District , Northern Areas , Pakistan : AKU-AKHSP Collaboration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization estimate globally 9 million infant die annually birth first week life , majority death occur neonatal period . The bulk death result pregnancy delivery associate complication , premature birth , intrauterine growth retardation infectious disease . There seven million perinatal death annually globally mostly develop country . Almost 4 million newborn suffer moderate severe birth asphyxia , least 800,000 die probably higher number develop sequel epilepsy , mental retardation , cerebral palsy learn disability . A recent community base study Zimbabwe , audit perinatal mortality show common single cause perinatal asphyxia avoidable factor detect 76 % case . In another population base study Bangladesh , show perinatal mortality rate 75 per 1000 birth ( 37 stillbirth , 38 first week death ) , major cause early neonatal death attribute small size birth ( 54 % ) , birth asphyxia ( 26 % ) , tetanus ( 8 % ) . In Bangalore , South India prospective hospital base study 4572 birth show perinatal mortality 43/1000 . Using Wiggles worth 's classification , 24 % consider due birth asphyxia , even exclusion premature group . Similarly recent evaluation large hospital-based birth cohort perinatal death Karachi accord Wiggles worth 's criterion , indicate almost 30 % death relate acute asphyxia . Hypotheses 1 . A concerted coordinated community-based program training first level primary care worker i.e . TBAs , LHWs , lady health visitor rural health center physicians prevention , early recognition management common perinatal / neonatal problem result significant reduction perinatal neonatal mortality Northern area Pakistan . 2 . A coordinated program community education awareness importance perinatal care , prevention recognition neonatal problem lead improve neonatal health , good recognition neonatal problem care-seeking behavior . 3 . The strengthen secondary care perinatal newborn care reproductive health service lead improved referral pattern perinatal / neonatal problem well outcome . 4 . Increasing community awareness neonatal problem train first level primary care worker result good domiciliary management neonatal problem . Phase 1 : Formative Research The objective first phase study follow 1 . Determination precondition study care seek practice ( referral system , availability BHU staff , doctor , LHVs ) 2 . Focusing question formative research care-seeking cause perinatal / neonatal morbidity / mortality modify perinatal / neonatal verbal autopsy ) 3 . Rapid anthropological assessment care-seeking behavior 4 . Illness Episode Channel Survey 5 . Analysis result formative research 6 . Identification desire behavior change 7 . Selection behavior intervention potential acceptability 8 . Acceptability plan intervention ( ) family , community care provider possible additional structural change This initial phase formative research , conduct Hunza-Karimabad/Nagar/Gojal tehsils Gilgit District Northern area . A combined methodology KAP survey verbal/social autopsy employ . These include in-depth evaluation knowledge , attitude practice family primary care giver ( TBAs , LHWs , LHVs BHU/RHC staff ) regard - Common cause maternal morbidity pregnancy - Maternal nutrition dietary pattern pregnancy - Determinants care seek behavior pregnancy labor - Domiciliary versus hospital birth - Selection care giver family - Reasons referral primary care giver - Perception recognition danger sign child birth family care giver - Immediate early newborn care practice ( colostrum prelacteal feeding , breastfeeding , cord care , temperature regulation , swaddle , skin care etc ) . - Concepts early neonatal morbidity health seek behavior ; - Risk factor birth asphyxia meconium aspiration - Low birth weight temperature regulation - Neonatal infection ( local generalize ) - Seizures spasms - Respiratory problem - Jaundice - Feeding difficulty Phase 2 : Implementation phase The overall objective phase intervention introduction implementation simple education training material family caregiver community-based perinatal newborn care mean phased introduction program area . In addition primary care giver target village study area would receive training stabilization early referral sick newborn secondary care . The intervention package , consist awareness creation positive maternal newborn health care practice household level importance ; seek antenatal care , adequate nutrition pregnancy lactation , skilled birth attendance , early initiation breastfeeding , delay bath recognition danger sign warrant early referral , develop collaboration Aga Khan Health Services , Pakistan . The practice promote though community mobilization education strategy include formation Community Health Committee ( CHC ) group education session use flip chart video . The LHWs CHWs intervention area provide enhanced training cause perinatal newborn mortality risky maternal newborn care practice expect transmit knowledge family avoid practice . They receive train deliver intervention package standardize workshop include hand practice use specific Information Education Communication ( IEC ) material develop purpose . The recently modify simplify integrated management neonatal childhood illness ( IMNCI ) base system form basis screening , recognition danger sign referral . The CHWs deliver intervention LHW uncover area within intervention area . Control area continue receive routine service governmental non-governmental organization area . But public health care facility intervention control area receive similar competency base training stabilization early referral sick newborn secondary care . The intervention Package The LHWs CHWs receive training IMNCI-based training package . They also receive orientation purpose project facilitate group education session use flip chart video . The community-based health education session introduce target local community sensitize regard maternal , perinatal newborn health issue . In addition , Two day train workshop organize train TBAs intervention area `` Clean Delivery Practices '' near health facility . The UNICEF manual ( DAI ) training adopt training . The intervention package deliver monthly household visit , one-to-one counseling session pregnant woman video session community . Additionally , LHWs CHWs intervention area record information home visit , newborn illness , referral , live birth death special format design project . For community mobilization education , two type tool use one group session use flip chart group session use video . Participants invite Muhallas ( Sub-geographical distribution village population ) attend session , facilitate LHW/CHW organize session . Separate session organize male female . One session per area organize quarterly basis local school LHW health house CHW household within intervention area . Target group woman reproductive age , adolescent girl , father , mother father law mother law .</detailed_description>
