	<brief_summary>A prospective multicenter trial start Korea evaluate diagnostic accuracy endometrial aspiration biopsy compare D &amp; C patient treat progestin endometrial hyperplasia ( EH ) . For conservative treatment EH , oral progestin commonly use method various treatment regimen recently , levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) also use successfully treat EH . However , report accuracy endometrial sample hormonal treatment follow-up evaluation EH . Patients histologically confirm EH offer hormonal treatment , one follow 3 option : oral medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) 10mg/day 14days per cycle , continuous oral MPA 10mg/day , insertion LNG-IUS . Histological surveillance perform 3-months 6-months follow initial treatment . Endometrial tissue obtain via endometrial aspiration biopsy use pipelle D &amp; C . In case use LNG-IUS , endometrial aspiration biopsy do LNG-IUS uterus , removal LNG-IUS , D &amp; C do . The biopsy finding compare . The primary endpoint consistency result endometrial aspiration biopsy D &amp; C . The secondary endpoint response rate 3 type progestin treatment 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endometrial hyperplasia ( EH ) premalignant lesion endometrial cancer ( EC ) , common gynecological malignancy develop country [ 1 ] . Therefore , accurate diagnostics proper management EH clinically significant prevent EC development . The treatment modality EH mostly depend histological diagnosis woman 's desire retain fertility . The risk cancer progression low woman non-atypical EH ( &lt; 5 % ) increase 30 % woman atypical EH [ 2 , 3 ] . In respect , hysterectomy recommend treatment atypical EH . Meanwhile , patient non-atypical EH young patient atypical EH strongly desire preserve fertility , various conservative therapy use progestin use . Traditionally , orally administer progestin megestrol acetate ( MA ) medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) commonly use method various treatment regimen [ 4 , 5 ] . More recently , levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS ) , achieve high local concentration progestogens endometrium , low systemic side effect , also use successfully treat EH [ 6-12 ] . However , report accuracy endometrial sample hormonal treatment EH best technique follow-up evaluation EH . A recent study compare histological result pipelle biopsy D &amp; C report almost equal EH-diagnostic success rate [ 13 ] . Meanwhile , result obtain case LNG-IUS uterus progestin effect endometrium . Therefore , investigator conduct large multicenter prospective study compare diagnostic accuracy endometrial aspiration biopsy dilatation &amp; curettage ( D &amp; C ) follow evaluation patient treat progestin EH .</detailed_description>
