	<brief_summary>Intrauterine device ( IUDs ) widely use reversible contraceptive . Both copper- levonorgestrel ( LNG ) -releasing IUDs ( LNG-IUDs ) safe , cost-effective long term equally effective compare tubal sterilization . In addition , LNG-IUD ( MirenaÂ® ) provide non contraceptive benefit , treatment menorrhagia , dysmenorrhea anemia . The current use IUDs among reproductive-aged woman range 8 15 % worldwide . Reported complication related IUD insertion 8.8 % insertion failure , 2.8-11.5 % cervical problem , 0.2 % cervical perforation , 0.2 % syncope 5.8 % expulsion . Insertion failures cervical problem seem occur often among woman never deliver vaginally . Cervical stenosis , immature small cervix significantly ante- retroverted position uterus , describe factor associate difficult sound cervical canal even failure insert IUD . Misoprostol inexpensive prostaglandin E1-analogue , associated side effect . More several show benefit misoprostol cervical ripening agent non pregnant woman . Priming misoprostol prior hysteroscopy dilatation curettage ( D &amp; C ) perimenopausal woman result increased cervical dilatation lower rate cervical laceration . The effect misoprostol cellular matrix cause dissolution collagen fiber increase amount fluid stroma consequentially cause cervical effacement . Fear pain insertion , however , might prevent woman choose IUD fear painful and/or difficult placement may lead recommend counsel woman , less effective method . Women 's perception pain multifactorial likely influenced cultural difference personal experience ; insertion-related pain therefore difficult predict . Nevertheless , factor associate great pain include nulliparity , currently breastfeed long time since last pregnancy ; factor , nulliparity strong predictor pain . The proportion woman reproductive age nulliparous increase , woman delay childbirth few child choose remain childless . The proportion Caesarean section birth also increase woman ever Caesarean section often view nulliparous respect IUD placement . Anticipated pain often great actual pain experience , majority nulliparous woman experience moderate pain IUD insertion . However , among nulliparous woman subset ( 17 % ) insertion IUD associate severe pain.These woman need effective pain relief . For nulliparous , nulligravid parous woman , IUD insertion perform successfully without cervical prim minimum amount discomfort . Whether selective use misoprostol role management pain certain subset woman ( e.g . nulliparous woman insertion non-routine/difficult ) yet adequately study .</brief_summary>
