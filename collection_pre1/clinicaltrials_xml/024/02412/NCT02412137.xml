	<brief_summary>To measure effectiveness counsel brace-wear compliance curve progression patient adolescent idiopathic scoliosis . The investigator hypothesize compliance increase measure used counsel patient , therefore patient less curve progression few would need surgery . A second purpose evaluate whether correlation BMI brace effectiveness . Proposed theory decrease effectiveness patient elevate BMI include decrease compliance due discomfort decrease force exert curve due large habitus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Compliance Counseling Brace Success Patients With Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan enroll 300 subject prospectively hypothesis lose followup , would like final number least 125 group . All patient fit inclusion criterion consent participate study two temperature monitor instal inside pad front brace . The monitor sample temperature every hour , room temperature body temperature represent period non-use use respectively . Each temperature monitor program record temperature sequentially , long period time monitor case patient 's appointment get postpone beyond time capacity one monitor . The monitor download laptop computer orthotist scoliosis clinic visit . A short questionnaire entitle Brace Beliefs Questionnaire , consist 18 question , administer patient time brace prescription . In approximately 50 % patient , information would share follow-up visit nurse , orthotist , physician . Patients go randomized communication clinic wait room common among braced patient . However , patient treat specific physician include either counsel group , treat different physician standard care group , patient wait room give time would enrol single arm study . The patient parent give visit 's wear-time information counsel regard compliance use information . A standardized progress report ( Brace Progress Report ) complete physician orthotist . In 50 % patient , person download logger would aware wear-time information would share medical staff . Those patient receive detailed counseling regard actual hour brace wear documented temperature logger , instead receive routine clinical care include discussion importance compliance . Radiographs routinely obtain clinic measured Principle Investigator . No extra radiograph obtain base participation study . The curve classify use criterion Lenke . Scoliosis measure Cobb angle technique Risser sign chart . Curve progression define progression great equal six degree . Patients progression great 45 degree , surgery recommend , undergo spinal fusion surgery note . Enrollment follow-up , gather data , analysis prospective data 200 subject estimate take approximately 5 year . We disclose subject information temperature monitor use monitor compliance disclosure would change purpose study . With permission author ( Katz , et al , 2010 ) utilize de-identified BMI brace compliance data 100 patient complete previous study . This data combine information obtain patient participation study since study essentially use method measure patient brace wear compliance . The increased number lend strong evidence finding . A target accrual number 300 expect ( 100 de-identified retrospective data 200 prospective study subject ) . SOURCES OF RESEARCH MATERIAL : Existing diagnostic data could come patient ' medical record radiograph , temperature/date/time information download logger , data Brace Beliefs Questionnaire , data record Brace Progress Report obtain specifically research . Identifiable data obtain specifically research purpose use answer study question . Any data result radiographic study standard care associate patient 's clinical treatment , x-rays include research purpose study . The following information collect : - Patient name/ID - Age - Gender - Demographic information necessary initiate contact patient , include telephone number , address language - Date result physical exams clinical record radiographic study - Treatment history ( surgical non-surgical ) complication treatment - Temperature/date/time data download logger - Data short questionnaire ( Brace Beliefs Questionnaire ) - Documentation counsel session patient counsel group use Brace Progress Report . - Documentation counseling session `` counseling '' group along amount brace wear compliance record Brace Progress report . - For purpose report correlation brace effectiveness BMI , deidentified data 100 patient previously enrol IRB # 0598-2220 merge data collect physical exam brace compliance data study . RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECTS : Patients identify face-to-face candidate study treat physician orthotist scoliosis clinic Texas Scottish Rite Hospital Children present clinic diagnosis treatment idiopathic scoliosis brace initially prescribe . They invite , study procedure explain , encourage question answer . All patient inform temperature logger go inserted orthoses , temperature information download visit . Only group receive counseling informed temperature information measure brace compliance . The group inform temperature information indicate whether , often , brace worn . Informing logger measure compliance would influence outcome study , therefore share patient . Study Procedures Screening Procedures Subjects identify screen accord inclusion/exclusion criterion present clinic refer respective physician Orthotics Department bracing . This referral standard clinical procedure . Study Intervention After study subject accept invitation participate study , ask sign consent document give copy record . The Research Coordinator record documentation recruitment process , invitation participate study , inform consent Invitation Checklist . Subjects routinely assign randomly one seven orthopaedic physician 's clinic first visit . Which two study group belong determine physician seeing . All physician staff Orthopedists TSRH agree participate study list sub-investigators.The Principle Investigator draw physician name determine one receive information bracewear compliance download monitor provide counsel patient , physician staff receive information bracewear compliance patient visit , thus provide additional counseling base information . ( 1.One group counsel brace temperature/date/time data log visit . 2 . The group receive routine clinical care include discussion importance compliance . ) Procedures Evaluations All subject fit Orthotist customized scoliosis brace include two temperature logger disc ( size nickel coin ) fit felt line inside front brace . The subject give first set instruction regard wear care brace ( standard clinical procedure ) along Brace Beliefs Questionnaire ( take less 10 minute do specifically research purpose . If patient express anxiety answer question , ask whether want continue ) . At every subsequent clinic follow-up visit ( see Follow-up frequency duration ) , counsel group brace wear compliance document Brace Progress Report Orthotist download time/temperature data onto laptop sensor reader ( A piece computer hardware sensor clip attach laptop via USB port ) . The Orthotist reset temperature logger discs reinstall padding inside front brace order monitor next period brace wear . Depending group patient assign , either counsel 10 minute less regard brace-wear use Brace Progress report checklist , receive standard clinical care . Ideally , counsel would do treat physician ( standard clinical care ) use Bracing Progress Report Form ( do research purpose ) . Counseling may also do nurse coordinator involve patient 's care ( standard clinical care ) utilize Bracing Progress Report Form treat physician available . Data Brace Beliefs Questionnaire use discover subject 's initial attitude wear brace . Brace wear compliance data receive counseled patient compare data receive patient receive standard clinical care see whether counsel make difference compliance thus clinical outcome . Follow-up Patients follow duration bracing , typically last approximately one four year , depend rate growth curve progression . Data collect time present clinic follow-up , average two three time per year . Each patient follow skeletally mature , two year follow brace discontinuation , spinal fusion surgery perform . Final outcome ( whether progress surgery ) include data collect study . )</detailed_description>
