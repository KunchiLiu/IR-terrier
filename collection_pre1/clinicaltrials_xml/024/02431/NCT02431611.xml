This 5-year project conduct three phase . In Phase 1 investigator utilize non-randomized , clinical observational trial examine biomarkers nicotine carcinogen exposure ( urine cotinine total NNAL [ metabolite NNK ] , respectively ) among 150 maternal-infant pair assessment conduct pregnancy delivery . In Phase 2 , investigator obtain qualitative feedback finding Phase 1 individual interview conduct 32 woman use tobacco develop biomarker feedback intervention message . Phase 3 consist formative evaluation biomarker feedback intervention 60 pregnant woman use two-group randomized design ass intervention 's feasibility acceptability , biochemically confirm abstinence rate end pregnancy . All phase project guide Community Advisory Committee . Each phase important step advance investigator ' understand potential biomarker feedback strategy help Alaska Native pregnant woman quit tobacco use .
