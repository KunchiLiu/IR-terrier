	<brief_title>Catheter Over Needle v Catheter Through Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Total Knee Replacement Surgery commonly perform procedure cause significant post-operative pain . Continuous femoral nerve block widely use analgesia part multimodal analgesic regimen surgery . They provide sustain analgesia allow early physiotherapy rehabilitation . Currently common technique insert catheter continuous femoral nerve block fee catheter though needle ( CTN ) place close nerve . There significant rate leak dislodgement catheter lead secondary failure catheter longer provide analgesia block nerve ( primary failure occur nerve block catheter fail provide analgesia start ) . The system investigate catheter needle ( CON ) leave place needle withdrawn . The propose benefit reduction leak rate dislodgement . This use CON technique mean big hole diameter catheter , rather CTN big hole diameter needle therefore allow leak around outside catheter . Objectives : To ascertain whether catheter needle technique superior catheter needle technique term leak rate . Trial plan : To recruit 108 patient total knee replacement surgery study randomise either CON CTN continuous femoral nerve block .</detailed_description>
