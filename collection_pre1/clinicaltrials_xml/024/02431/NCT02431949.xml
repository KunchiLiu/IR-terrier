	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND , PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION The perception music require coordinated neural activity distribute multi-functional center across hemisphere . The association musical ability general cognitive function study several population inconsistent result . Schizophrenia major mental disorder strongly associate cognitive deficit . These often appear onset psychotic symptom persist throughout effective treatment positive negative symptom . Like disorder psychosis , schizophrenia feature general deficit auditory memory sensory processing . Recently , Sawada et al . ( 2014 ) Wen et al . ( 2014 ) study music ability Japanese Chinese schizophrenic population . They use standardize assessment amusia call Montreal Battery Evaluation Amusia ( MBEA ) find marked impairment perception scale , contour , interval , rhythm , meter memory . Both study show deficit music perception associate cognitive deficit negative symptom . In regard positive symptom , Wen et al. , Sawada et al. , find significant association . The present clinical study assess musical ability use MBEA Canadian population without refractory psychosis . It explore association musical deficit , positive negative psychiatric symptomology cognition . The patient population diagnosis schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , affective disorder psychosis non substance-related psychosis refer British Columbia Psychosis Program ( BCPP ) due inadequate response least two trial antipsychotic . A focus refractory psychosis may provide great insight patient relatively pronounce psychiatric symptom cognitive deficit . It also valuable administer MBEA assessment Canadian population , test originally intend Western population musical phrase design Western tonality . 2 . RESEARCH OUTLINE This cross-sectional , observational study . Participating patient refractory psychosis healthy ( age- gender- matched ) control undergo Montreal Battery Evaluation Amusia assessment assessment cognition symptom . The purpose study describe music perceptive ability patient refractory psychosis use Montreal Battery Evaluation Amusia , standardize continuous measure musical ability . The criterion amusia score 2 standard deviation mean normal participant . 4 ) OBJECTIVES Primary : The primary objective compare music perceptive ability patient clinically identify refractory psychosis healthy subject . Secondary : The secondary objective compare prevalence amusia population patient refractory psychosis versus population healthy control , compare psychiatric symptom cognition patient amusia versus patient without amusia . We also determine association exists music perceptive ability : - General specific aspect symptom severity , assess standardized symptom rating scale neurological status examination . - General specific aspect cognition , assess cognitive test . - Demographic variable sex , age , musical training education . In addition , investigate potential pathway symptomologies psychosis , cognitive deficit musical disability ( find ) use exploratory mediation analysis . 5 ) RESEARCH METHOD We recruit 100 participant , undergo Montreal Battery Evaluation Amusia test cognitive test . Of , 50 age- gender- match participant diagnosed psychosis disorder serve control . The remain 50 participant recruit BCPP UBC Hospital in-patients diagnose refractory psychosis . For patient , participation also involve assessment mental health ( psychiatric symptom ) . 6 ) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Inferential analysis use assess difference musical ability patient control . It also use evaluate difference psychiatric symptom cognition patient amusia without amusia . Linear regression analyse do relate psychiatric symptom cognition musical ability . Mediation analysis perform determine causal model symptom , cognition musical ability .</detailed_description>
