	<brief_summary>Neuroendocrine tumour ( NETs ) group neoplasm generally arise gastroenteropancreatic tract . They usually slow grow , low malignant potential , often go unnoticed become metastatic . The correct treatment approach dependent extent disease , however surgical approach systemic therapy curative . Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) use radiotracer 18F-6-L-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18F-FDOPA ) show promising non-invasive technique help localize NETs guide treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FDOPA PET Neuroendocrine Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose/Objective : The purpose study provide access 18F-6-L fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18F-FDOPA ) positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PET/CT ) image patient neuroendocrine tumour ( NET ) collect additional data effectiveness 18F-DOPA PET/CT patient population . Hypothesis : 1 . The overall accuracy 18F-FDOPA PET/CT superior conventional image technique detection neuroendocrine tumour . 2 . The sensitivity 18F-FDOPA PET/CT superior conventional image technique detection neuroendocrine tumour . Justification : Treatment NET 's depend extent disease rate tumour progression . Accurate stag critical establish prognosis disease , guide potentially curative surgical approach assist therapeutic decision making surgery , embolization technique systemic therapy . Standard radiologic nuclear medicine technique significant limitation term ability detect lesion evaluate response treatment . The widely use PET tracer 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18-FDG ) limit value NET 's due non-specific uptake relatively low mitotic rate often see tumour . Combined PET/CTutilizing 18F-FDOPA investigate potentially sensitive specific stag localization technique NETs . Expression tumour-specific catecholamine transport storage mechanisms NET cell basis 18F-DOPA PET imaging . Cellular uptake radiopharmaceutical concentration intracellular storage granule within tumour cell neuroendocrine origin differentiation , combine high sensitivity , resolution accurate anatomic localization PET/CT imaging , make 18F-DOPA PET/CT potentially superior standard nuclear medicine radiologic technique detection localization function non-functioning NETs . This imaging technique provide specific functional biochemical information via PET image , also morphological anatomical detail via CT image lead accurate localization characterization individual lesion . This may allow good treatment planning well restaging therapy ass disease response . The information retrieve hybrid 18F-FDOPA PET/CT could profound influence diagnosis treatment patient NETs . Research Method : This expand access study adult pediatric subject invite participate . All subject inform anticipated effect ( none ) purpose inject substance . Subjects approach treat physician respect willingness participate propose study base clinical criterion . They undergo brief clinical assessment follow PET/CT scan protocol . The BC Cancer Agency anticipate start date August 2012 potential completion date August 2017 . Three full year data collection provide meaningful number analysis . A total 300 patient , include adult pediatric patient , recruit study . This number base anticipated number PET scan referral expect five-year study timeframe . Statistical Analysis : The primary outcome estimate sensitivity , specificity accuracy 18F-DOPA PET . 95 % confidence interval calculate estimate . Outcomes estimated whole study population different type cancer . Sensitivity ( ratio true positive lesion total positive lesion ) , specificity ( ratio true negative lesion total negative lesion ) accuracy ( ratio total correct study total number biopsied lesion ) 18F-FDOPA PET study perform BCCA obtain compare result PET scan gold-standard histopathological diagnosis result available ( determined clinical indication feasibility treat physician ) result conventional imaging . Biopsy lesion mandate study . Confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) sensitivity , specificity accuracy calculate use exact binomial distribution . Results compare figure publish literature . All analysis perform direct consultation statistician member BC Cancer Agency staff .</detailed_description>
