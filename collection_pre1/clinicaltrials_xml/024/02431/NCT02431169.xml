	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct pilot feasibility study single agent erlotinib patient metastatic EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma lung one prior treatment sole purpose characterize genomic landscape erlotinib time disease progression . The logistics obtain adequate quality fresh tissue specimens sequence study therapy time disease progression patient advance lung cancer complex thorough understand practical challenge conduct study like crucial . The current proposal include exome transcriptome sequencing blood collect baseline along tumor sample obtain prior start erlotinib time disease progression ( total two tissue sample one blood sample per patient ) . If carry successfully , propose strategy likely lead large adequately power study understand fully evolve molecular change due clonal selection treatment pressure . The pace progress field sequence technology currently underway likely accelerate near future yield rich highly content-rich information . Moreover , likely genomic information DNA sequencing transcriptome supplement analysis translatomes proteomes . The investigator plan sequence paired tumor specimens 20 patient EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma lung treatment erlotinib time disease progression follow treatment erlotinib . As investigator expect drop ( due unexpected clinical event preclude second biopsy time disease progression , poor specimen quality early discontinuation therapy non-progression ) , investigator enroll 40 patient trial get 20-paired specimen .</brief_summary>
