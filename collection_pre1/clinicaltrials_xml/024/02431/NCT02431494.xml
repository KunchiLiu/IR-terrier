	<brief_summary>Acne vulgaris multifactorial , highly prevalent dermatologic condition result visible lesion quite disfigure . Consequently , individual acne often suffer wide range psychological manifestation . Although consensus combination therapy effective treating acne , researcher constantly strive develop new treatment . Microcurrent therapy ( MCT ) non-invasive modality successfully used promote wound heal routinely use aesthetic . Use MCT alone combination current successful treatment blue light phototherapy ( BLP ) , may hold promise acne treatment . The investigator propose conduct small randomize control trial determine safety preliminary efficacy novel combination therapy treat acne vulgaris . The investigator recruit 60 male female randomly assign one 3 arm : 1 ) BLP ; 2 ) MCT ; combination therapy ( BLP MCT ) . The investigator assess physiological parameter ( number acne lesion , amount sebum produce , degree acne severity ) psychosocial factor ( dermatologic quality life , social anxiety , depressive symptomatology , self-esteem ) . Participants complete baseline assessment prior initiate treatment follow-up assessment 4 week post termination treatment . The investigator conduct intermediary assessment week 3 5 1 week post termination treatment . The investigator use measure central tendency describe sample repeat measure analysis variance compute main interaction effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Preliminary Efficacy Combination Therapy Treatment Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview : The goal study conduct small randomize control trial ( RCT ) test safety preliminary efficacy novel combination therapy treat acne vulgaris . The investigator also explore effect treatment psychosocial factor ( Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) , social anxiety , depressive symptomatology , self-esteem ) . The RCT 3 arm : 1 ) FDA approve treatment : blue light phototherapy ( BLP ) ; 2 ) Microcurrent therapy ( MCT ) ; 3 ) combination therapy ( BLP + MCT ) . The main outcome : 1 ) number acne lesion ; 2 ) amount sebum produce , 3 ) degree acne severity ; 4 ) improvement dermatologic quality life . The specific aim study : Aim 1 : To explore use MCT improve blood flow lymphatic drainage promote tissue repair patient acne vulgaris . Aim 2 : To examine safety preliminary efficacy enhance traditional blue light therapy treatment microcurrent therapy ( BLP + MCT ) promote faster heal patient acne vulgaris . Aim 3 : To determine combination therapy effective ( few number acne lesion , decrease amount sebum produce , less degree acne severity great improvement dermatologic quality life ) acne either type monotherapy . Aim 4 : To explore effect three modality psychosocial factor ( social anxiety , depressive symptomatology , self-esteem ) . The investigator recruit 60 male female randomly assign one 3 treatment arm ( blue light phototherapy ( BLP ) ; microcurrent therapy ( MCT ) ; combination therapy ( BLP MCT ) . All participant complete baseline assessment prior initiate treatment one follow-up assessment 4 week post termination treatment . During treatment phase , investigator conduct intermediary assessment track progression treatment time week 3 5 well 1 week post termination treatment ( week 6 ) . The investigator conduct physiological psychosocial assessment ; content intermediary assessment much less 3 assessment reduce participant data . The comprehensive assessment conduct baseline one follow-up point consist physiological psychosocial factor well demographic factor collect exclusively baseline assessment . At intermediary assessment , investigator collect number acne lesion , amount sebum produce dermatologic quality life . Psychosocial data collect via computer-assisted self-interviews ( CASI ) . Physiological data enter computer program research staff . Procedures collect psychosocial data : All assessment conduct use computer-assisted self-interviews ( CASI ) . Participants assign unique study identification number ( ID ) use track data . Computer-assisted self-interviews effective tool measure sensitive socially stigmatized behavior . This mode data collection eliminate interviewer bias , standardize questionnaire administration , reduce skip pattern error . Using CASI , participant responds question use computer keyboard mouse . Selection CASI data collection decrease cost error entry , clean data , publication lag , well enhance interviewer efficiency . The laptop computer investigator use data collection set two different log-in screen , one participant one administrator . The screen use participant contain icon access CASI system . No file appear available screen . The investigator access CASI participant click icon filling assign participant ID number ( participant name ) complete set procedure . The investigator provide brief train use laptop completing CASI . As part training , participant complete brief set practice question illustrative type question response contain assessment . The investigator remain participant practice session answer question provide additional instruction . Participants encourage seek assistance , need , complete interview . At point , interview start participant complete interview . Once participant completes interview , he/she come upon screen instruct him/her contact investigator file may save correctly . Procedures collect physiological data : The investigator conduct visual inspection affect area systematically count number acne lesion present face . At baseline follow-up assessment investigator also take high quality digital photograph affect area use compute degree acne severity . The photograph identify exclusively study ID keep password protect file secure NSU computer . The Sebumeter® SM 815 sebum meter use estimate amount sebum produce . The investigator bring mat tape meter contact affect area . This instrument use non-invasive probe place affected area instrument calculate amount sebum produce .</detailed_description>
