	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability PENNVAX速-GP HIV-1 DNA vaccine IL-12 DNA adjuvant , give intradermal ( ID ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection electroporation ( EP ) , healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . All study injection give use EP device , use electric pulse briefly open tiny pore cell . Researchers evaluate whether EP increase immune response vaccine . The study enroll participant four group . Within group , participant randomly assign receive PENNVAX速-GP DNA vaccine/IL-12 DNA adjuvant placebo . Each group receive different dos vaccine . Enrollment begin Group 1 , receive low dose vaccine adjuvant . Study staff review safety data Group 1 enrol people Groups 2 , 3 , 4 high dos . Participants group receive injection study entry ( Day 0 ) Months 1 , 3 , 6 . At injection visit , participant Groups 1 4 receive injection one arm , participant Groups 2 3 receive injection arm . Groups 1 , 2 , 3 receive ID injection , Group 4 receive IM injection . Participants attend study visit Day 0 , Week 2 , Months 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 9 , 12 . Visits include physical examination , urine collection , blood collection , HIV risk reduction counseling , assessment questionnaire . Some participant may photograph take injection site ( optional ) . Study staff contact participant Month 18 follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
