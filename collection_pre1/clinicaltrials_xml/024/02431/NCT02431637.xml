	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open-label study use P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria ( IBSM ) infection assess infectivity sexual life cycle stag malaria parasite ( gametocyte ) mosquito vector . Previous clinical study show treatment participant antimalarial drug piperaquine , addition effectively clear asexual ( pathogenic ) stag malaria life cycle , induces production gametocyte blood . The propensity piperaquine induce gametocytemia employ study ass gametocyte infectivity Anopheles mosquito . For purpose , experimental mosquito feed directly participant artificial membrane mosquito feeding perform . The study conduct 3 cohort ( n=2 per cohort ) . Subsequent cohort commence least day 28 previous cohort review Safety Review Team . This interval also allow cohorting experimental infection mosquito optimise logistics enable iterative improvement system applicable . Each participant cohort inoculate Day 0 ~2,800 viable parasite Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocyte ( BSPC ) administer intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor daily via phone call daily ( AM ) day 4 ( PCR positive presence malaria parasite ) . Once PCR positive monitor twice-daily morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) treatment , adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . On day designate commencement treatment , determine qPCR result ( approximately day 6-8 ) , participant admit study unit monitor . The threshold commencement treatment PCR quantification participant = 5,000 parasites/mL . If PCR quantification participant = 10,000 parasites/mL accompany clinical symptom score &gt; 8 occurs participant participant reach treatment threshold ( PCR quantification = 5,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Participants follow inpatient least 48 hour ensure tolerance treatment clinical response , clinically well outpatient basis safety clearance malaria parasites via PCR . Following treatment piperaquine , transmission study undertake gametocytemia appear . Blood collect ( AM ) participant membrane feed assay An . Stephensi . For membrane feeding study , blood keep 38C ( prevent premature exflagellation ) 35 minute dispense membrane feeder . For direct feeding study , participant escort quarantine insectary facility QIMR Berghofer also ask allow vector mosquito fee volar surface forearm thighs period 10 ± 5 minute ( direct feeding assay ) . The experimental infection mosquito direct feeding participant perform 3 time , artificial ( indirect ) membrane feed 10 time prior curative antimalarial treatment End Of Study Riamet® ( artemether-lumefantrine ) primaquine ( 45 mg ) . A repeat dose piperaquine 960 mg may administer outpatient basis recrudescent asexual parasitemia occurs define consecutively increase parasite count 1000 parasites/mL . Preemptive rescue treatment Riamet® commence whenever deem necessary investigator . Participants administer rescue Riamet® site initial dosing follow monitoring , either clinic , telephone three day ensure adherence Riamet® therapy . Participants treat single dose primaquine ( 45 mg ) describe section 4.4.2 protocol concurrent Riamet® treatment ensure clearance gametocyte present . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , within clinical research unit , outpatient review malaria challenge inoculation anti-malarial study drug administration . Blood sample safety evaluation , malaria monitoring , red blood cell antibody draw screen and/or baseline nominate time malaria challenge .</detailed_description>
