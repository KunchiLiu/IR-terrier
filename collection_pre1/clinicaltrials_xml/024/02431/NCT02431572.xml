	<brief_summary>This research study study change primary metastatic brain tumor inflammation use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image use radioactive substance call [ 11C ] PBR28a , also know peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) , PBR-PET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate PBR PET Brain Tumor Patients Treated With Chemoradiation Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention . The purpose pilot study obtain preliminary data need justify perform large clinical trial effectiveness investigational intervention . Standard treatment subject ' disease include chemoradiation immunotherapy . In PET scan , radioactive substance inject body . The scan machine find radioactive substance , tend go cancer cell area inflammation . For PET scan study , investigator use radioactive substance call [ 11C ] PBR28 . The investigator would like see tracer use detect change inflammation tumor treatment . PBR-PET scan perform screen therapy several weeks/months start therapy , depend type therapy use . No diagnostic decision clinical treatment decision make base result obtain PET scan , change care . The information study may help investigator design method could use large study completely understand role inflammation treatment cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must evidence metastatic melanoma brain Cohort A histologically confirm GBM Cohorts Band C. Those newly diagnose GBM suspected pseudoprogression completion chemoradiation enroll Cohort C. Participants must measurable brain disease , define least one lesion 10 mm diameter . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 3 month . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . For Cohort A , patient metastatic melanoma brain treat physician plan give immunotherapy monotherapy eligible study . This set clinical trial . For Cohort B , patient GBM treat physician plan give immunotherapy eligible study . This set clinical trial . For Cohort C , patient newly diagnose GBM complete standard temozolomide + radiation suspect pseudoprogression within first 3 month complete chemoradiation enroll . Patient must able undergo MRI PET scan . Patient must maintain stable corticosteroid regimen 5 day prior MRPET scan . High mixed affinity binder ( Ala/Ala Ala/Thr ) base genotyping result PBR affinity test . This blood test perform part screen process consent obtain . The effect PBR develop human fetus unknown . For reason radiopharmaceutical agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Radiopharmaceutical agent know teratogenic . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PBR . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study PBR radiopharmaceutical agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary exposure mother PBR , breastfeed discontinue . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive participant exclude immune system compromise may affect interpretation image data . Patients suitable undergo MRI PET use gadolinium contrast due : Claustrophobia Presence metallic object implant medical device body ( i.e . cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , tattoo near eye , steel implant ) The craniotomy patient titanium MRI compatible Sickle cell disease Renal failure Reduced renal function , determine creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min base serum creatinine level obtain within 28 day prior registration</criteria>
