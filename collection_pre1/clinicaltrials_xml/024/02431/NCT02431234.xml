	<detailed_description>Introduction : Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) primary major amputation risk factor diabetes . The PAD particularly common among diabetic patient high cardiovascular risk ( 20-30 % coronary patient PAD ) . The calcification atherosclerotic plaque medium leg artery contribute narrow arterial lumen expose diabetic patient critical limb ischemia . The receptor RANK ( Receptor Activator Nuclear Factor Îº B ) ligand RANKL form complex initially describe involved bone metabolism activate osteoclast RANK / RANKLigand system could also involved process calcification arterial obstruction , especially low limb . Currently anti-RANKL antibody use human could possibly slow process . But necessary prove involvement system PAD diabetic patient high cardiovascular risk propose therapeutic trial . Assumptions : concentration RANKL could predictive calcification leg arteries diabetes Main objective : To show serum RANKL concentration predict progression calcification leg artery diabetic patient , independently cardiovascular risk factor . Secondary Objectives : - To show link protein bone remodeling , marker inflammation glycation , calcification leg artery . - Measuring rate calcification leg artery . - Phenotype diabetic patient high rate calcification . Primary Outcome : Predictive power serum RANKL concentration T0 progression calcification leg artery T0 T24 month . Methodology : prospective observational study . The calcium score leg artery evaluate scanner T0 24 month . Inclusion criterion : - type 2 diabetes - woman 60 - men 50 year - men woman know coronary artery disease Non-inclusion criterion : - severe renal failure - immunodeficiency - acute infectious inflammatory disease - history bypass surgery sub-popliteal angioplasty Number subject require : 188 patient include . Total study duration : 24 month Inclusion period : 24 month</detailed_description>
