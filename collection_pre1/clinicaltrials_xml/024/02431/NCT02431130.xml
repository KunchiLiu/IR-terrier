	<brief_summary>The goal study examine whether low‐fidelity instructor‐driven simulation provide effective teaching anesthetist ' non‐technical skill develop world context . Human factor , communication , planning , team work consider nontechnical skill contribute greatly patient safety `` complex hazardous system '' aviation , nuclear power industry , operate room . Simulation begin aviation industry train pilot human factor . In past two decade simulation value medical education allow learner rehearse skill environment similar workplace without threat harm patient . High Fidelity simulator involve computer drive interactive mannequin recreate authentic environment . This use successfully teach anesthetist ' non‐technical skill ( ANTS ) : decision making , team working , task management , situation awareness . Anesthetists ' non‐technical skill particularly important develop country shortage supply , equipment , qualify personnel lead perilous work environment make team work communication vital patient safety . The cost high fidelity simulation prohibitive many develop country . This study seek examine whether low fidelity instructor drive simulation provide effective intervention teach anesthetist ' non‐technical skill Rwanda . If find effective , method training could apply develop country improve non‐technical skill anesthesia provider goal make surgery safer .</brief_summary>
