	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death North America world . The vast majority lung cancer associate cigarette smoking . Lung cancer incidence mortality rate similar lung cancer highly fatal disease . Unfortunately , majority lung cancer detect advanced stage poor prognosis . A substantial amount data report low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT ) screening . The result National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) show 20 % reduction mortality lung cancer LDCT screen addition 6.7 % decrease all-cause mortality , first ever screen intervention demonstrate improvement latter outcome . Yet endorsement lung cancer screen universal . Although NLST result encourage , investigation need . The objective study prospectively compare performance lung cancer risk prediction model ( RPM ) vs. NLST criterion inform optimal inclusion criterion clinical screen program ; prospectively compare novel screening base nodule malignancy probability calculation develop Pan-Canadian Early Detection Lung Cancer study vs. NLST criterion ; complete randomize controlled trial substudy compare intensive tobacco cessation counsel program usual care arm subject ongoing tobacco use ; perform cost analysis evaluate incremental cost associate LDCT screen lung cancer compare screening ; determine average cost associate incidental finding , false positive finding lung cancer find screening period ; compare cost implication screen enrollment criterion . The backbone research project screen risk individual lung cancer LDCT scan . Eight hundred risk Albertans screen baseline , year 1 year 2 . Additional clinical LDCT investigation may result finding study CT scan .</detailed_description>
