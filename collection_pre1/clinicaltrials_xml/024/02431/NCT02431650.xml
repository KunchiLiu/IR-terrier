	<detailed_description>This single-centre , control , open label study use P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria ( IBSM ) infection ass effectiveness OZ439 gametocytocidal agent , well treatment effect gametocyte infectivity development vector mosquito . Previous clinical study include one IBSM study show addition effectively clear replicate , asexual ( pathogenic ) life cycle stage malaria , single dose piperaquine ( 480 mg ) result production gametocyte , determine gametocyte-specific transcript ( pfs25 ) qPCR . The propensity piperaquine induce gametocytaemia employ study ass efficacy OZ439 gametocytocidal transmission block agent . Experimental mosquito feed via direct feeding participant artificial ( indirect ) membrane mosquito feeding perform . The study conduct 3 cohort participant randomise experimental control group ( n=2 per group ) peak gametocytemia occur ( approximately 15 day administration piperaquine ) . The group equal size participant experimental group receive OZ439 participant control group receive primaquine ( positive control OZ439 , administer 15 mg single dose ) . The dose OZ439 investigate experimental group first cohort 500 mg administer single dose . Doses use subsequent cohort ( ) determine follow review observe OZ439 safety , pharmacodynamic drug effect define gametocyte clearance kinetics transmission block activity . The dos use cohort 2 3 may adjust , exceed maximum acceptable dose predefined study ( i.e . 1200 mg OZ439 ) determine previous safety pilot efficacy study . The dose determine funding sponsor principal investigator ( PI ) follow Safety Review team ( SRT ) scientific evaluation . Subsequent cohort commence least day 28 previous cohort review Safety Review Team . This interval also allow cohorting experimental infection mosquito optimise logistics enable iterative improvement system applicable . Each participant cohort inoculate Day 0 ~2,800 viable parasite Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocyte ( BSPC ) administer intravenously . On outpatient basis , participant monitor daily via phone call daily ( AM ) day 4 ( PCR positive presence malaria parasite ) . Once PCR positive monitor twice-daily morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) treatment , adverse event unexpected early onset symptom , sign parasitological evidence malaria . On day designate commencement treatment determine qPCR result ( approximately Study day 7 ) , participant admit study unit monitor . The threshold commencement treatment PCR quantification participant = 5,000 parasites/mL . If PCR quantification participant = 5,000 parasites/mL accompany clinical symptom score &gt; 5 , participant reach treatment threshold ( PCR quantification = 1,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Participants follow inpatient least 48 h ensure tolerance treatment clinical response , clinically well outpatient basis safety clearance malaria parasites via PCR . Cohort1 . Following initial piperaquine treatment , repeat dose piperaquine ( 960 mg ) may administer outpatient basis recrudescent asexual parasitemia occurs ( define 3 consecutively increase parasite count 1000 parasites/mL ) . Participants also evaluate presence gametocyte blood , determine qPCR ( amplification pfs25 gametocyte-specific transcript ) . Assessment OZ439 gametocytocidal property transmission study undertake gametocytemia appear . Participants randomise experimental control group peak gametocytemia occurs ( approximately 15 day administration piperaquine i.e . day 22 study ) . Participants experimental group ( n=2 per dose cohort ) administer OZ439 single 500 mg dose participant control group ( n=2 ) receive primaquine 15 mg single dose . Blood collect ( AM ) participant group membrane feed assays An . stephensi vector mosquito . For direct feeding assay ( DFA ) , participant escort quarantine insectary facility QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute ask allow vector mosquito fee volar surface forearm , calf thighs period 10 ± 5 minute . The experimental infection mosquito direct feeding participant perform maximum three time point maximum interval 10 day , approximately 15 day post-piperaquine treatment ( 1 direct feed prior receive OZ439 ( active ) primaquine ( control ) , 2 feed schedule follow OZ439 ( active ) primaquine ( control ) treatment ) . Artificial ( indirect ) membrane feeding ( IFA ) may occur 10 time prior curative anti-malarial treatment End Study Riamet® ( artemether-lumefantrine ) primaquine ( 45 mg ) . Cohort2 3 . A similar study design treatment procedure use two subsequent cohort . Doses OZ439 evaluate select analysis data cohort1 . Doses OZ439 exceed 1200 mg. Pre-emptive rescue treatment Riamet® commence whenever deem necessary investigator . Participants administer rescue Riamet® site initial dosing follow monitoring , either clinic , telephone three day ensure adherence Riamet® therapy . Participants treat single dose primaquine ( 45 mg ) describe section 4.4.2 protocol concurrent Riamet® treatment ensure clearance gametocyte present . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , within clinical research unit , outpatient review malaria challenge inoculation anti-malarial study drug administration . Blood sample safety evaluation , malaria monitoring , red blood cell antibody draw screen .</detailed_description>
