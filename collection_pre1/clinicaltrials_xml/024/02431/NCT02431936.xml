	<detailed_description>High blood pressure , hypertension , serious problem African-American ( AA ) population affect nearly 7 every 10 AAs area . Previously investigator show significant number AAs hold onto retained salt mental stress ( sodium retainer ) . The investigator believe increase salt load result blood pressure load contribute eventual development hypertension individual . The purpose study find response due direct stimulation kidney ( organ control salt level body , brain ) . To , investigator determine drug stop connection brain kidney mental stress prevent sodium retention sodium retainer . Prazosin alpha adrenergic receptor blocker approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . None subject participate study high blood pressure . The subject know test week drug week placebo week . Participants test twice study , one week take Prazosin daily week test take placebo ( sugar pill ) daily order see Prazosin change body handle salt stress . The participant inform test week Prazosin week placebo week . This study involve screen visit , two first dose visit two test week approximate 5 week period ( include one week `` washout '' period ) . Each test week 3 day salt-controlled diet prior test approximate 3-hour testing period Day 4 . The 3-hour testing period include 10 minute baseline rest , 45 minute mild stress ( competitive video game ) , 45 minute recovery rest . A total 4 blood 4 urine sample collect 3-hour period . Each blood draw consist 4 teaspoon total 16 teaspoon . If participant female , pregnancy test perform begin test visit ( screen , first dose-1 , test day-1 , first dose-2 test day-2 ) confirm pregnant . Muscle sympathetic nerve activity measure test insertion electrode knee out part right leg . Additionally , IV infusion administer phenylephrine challenge insure total blockade sympathetic nervous system .</detailed_description>
