	<brief_summary>Elastic compression stocking recommend treatment venous insufficiency . Degressive compressive stocking use many decade characterize high pressure apply ankle decrease pressure ankle knee . Progressive compressive stocking develop maximal pressure calf . This concept base calf pump role venous return . Patients PAD ( Peripheral Arterial Disease ) often suffer venous insufficiency . But elastic compression stocking strictly contraindicate patient PAD high pressure ankle could slow superficial microcirculation . On patient PAD venous insufficiency , progressive compressive stocking could well indicate . Strongest pressure calf increase pump effect muscle mechanical efficiency walk without deleterious effect .</brief_summary>
