Elevated ALT serum creatinine screen clinically significant abnormality screen laboratory test determine Investigator . History medically treat diabetes treat medically diagnosed hypertension . Heterozygous subject diagnose hypertension well control treatment ( Refer Exclusion Criteria 20 ) , eligible . . Presence skin lesion suspicious malignancy , unless excise prior Day 1 . History malignancy except treated cervical carcinoma situ past 5 year . Active history clinically significant medical condition include renal , hepatic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , genitourinary , endocrine , immunologic , metabolic , neurologic , psychiatric hematological disease , base Investigator judgment . Acute illness history illness , opinion Investigator , could pose threat harm subject obscure interpretation laboratory test result interpretation study data . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen , positive hepatitis C antibody positive HIV test screen history positive testing ( e.g . liver biopsy , serology ) suggest acute chronic hepatitis . Abnormal 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) screen predose ( Day 1 Day 1 ) , except minor deviation deem clinical significance Investigator . Received experimental drug device within 30 day 5 half life , whichever longer , prior dose . Ongoing participation prior clinical study time screen .

The last use prescription medication must great 5 halflives specific medication least 14 day prior admission ( Day 1 ) , whichever longer . Hormonal contraception allow female subject . Heterozygous cohort : Use prescription medication regular basis allow following exception : Antihypertensives ( &lt; 3 medication stable dose ≥ 30 day ) ; Statins ( dose must ≤ half maximum dose ; must stable dose ≥3 month ) ; Fibrates ( must stable dose ≥3 month ) ; Niacin ( must stable dose ≥3 month ) ; Thyroxin ( stable dose ≥ 30 day ) ; The last use prescription medication need follow criterion cohort , outline . Use prescription medication list may allow discretion Investigator upon consultation Rhythm . Use nonprescription drug herbal substance study ( Final Study Visit ) . The last dose nonprescription drug must take great 5 halflives drug receive study drug . Inability attend study visit comply protocol requirement include fast restriction alcohol , caffeine , nicotine concomitant medication intake . A significant history drug/solvent abuse within 5 year screen positive test drug abuse test screening Day 1 . Positive alcohol ( breath test ) nicotine screen Screening Visit Day 1 ( positive nicotine screen apply heterozygous cohort ) . History alcohol abuse ( define average intake three unit alcohol per day ) within 5 year Screening Visit . History tobacco tobacco product use unless abstinent least one year prior Screening Visit . This criterion apply heterozygous subject . Previously randomize dose study . This criterion apply heterozygous subject . Any reason , opinion Investigator would confound proper evaluation study .</criteria>
