	<brief_title>GDP Frontline Chemotherapy Patients With PTCL-NOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma , otherwise specify constitute 25.9 % Peripheral T-cell lymphomas 15 % lymphomas World Health Organization classification . Because rare presentation evident heterogeneity PTCL-NOS , optimal frontline therapy disease modern era remain unclear . Patients traditionally treat anthracycline-containing chemotherapy CHOP CHOP-like regimen use B-cell NHLs . This strategy associate overall response rate high 60 % , 5-year PFS OS rate report low approximately 20-30 % .Better therapeutic regimen highly need improve survival outcome patient . The investigator ' previous study report ORR 64 % relapsed/refractory PTCL-NOS patient . Therefore , investigator design study evaluate efficacy safety GDP chemotherapy frontline treatment patient PTCL-NOS .</detailed_description>
