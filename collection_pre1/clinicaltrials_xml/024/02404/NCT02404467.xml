	<brief_summary>The hypothesis behind study proportion patient consider high intermediate risk surgery , relatively low risk TAVI , discharge early procedure ( within first 2-3 day ) without additional risk . Therefore , perform safety , early discharge may cut periprocedural TAVI cost significantly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility And Safety Early Discharge After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAVI ( Transcatheter aortic valve Implantation ) - A viable alternative surgical aortic valve replacement patient severe symptomatic aortic stenosis . Considered unacceptable surgical risk . Despite widespread utilization , procedure specific complication hospitalization associate cost limit TAVI expansion patient population low risk . Cost-effectiveness TAVI investigate either compare standard therapy patient candidate surgical valve replacement conventional surgical replacement high-risk patient . Formal economic evaluation inoperable patient demonstrate benefit TAVI achieve acceptable incremental cost society , least context U.S. U.K. health system . In patient severe , symptomatic AS high prohibitive surgical risk , PARTNER A trial demonstrate TAVI appear economically attractive strategy compare aortic valve replacement , provide patient suitable transfemoral approach . On hand , result trans-apical TAVI compare surgical replacement economically unfavorable .</detailed_description>
