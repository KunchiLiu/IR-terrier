	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate efficacy include effect inhibition progression structural damage , safety tolerability 2 year primary focus Week 16 ( week 24 structural damage ) , support use secukinumab pre-filled syringe ( PFS ) subcutaneous ( s.c. ) self-administration without load regimen subject active Psoriatic Arthritis ( PsA ) despite current previous NSAID , DMARD therapy and/or previous anti-TNFα therapy . Long term efficacy 2 year base sign symptom joint/bone structure preservation ( X-ray ) improvement physical function measure Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index ( HAQ-DI© ) , well skin nail improvement psoriasis sign .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Demonstrate Efficacy ( Including Inhibition Structural Damage ) , Safety Tolerability 2 Years Secukinumab Active Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study use randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group design . A screening period ( SCR ) run 10 week randomization use ass subject eligibility follow 104 week treatment . At BSL approximately 990 subject whose eligibility confirm randomized one four treatment group 2:2:2:3 ratio : - Group 1 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without load regimen - Group 2 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. load dose regimen - Group 3 - secukinumab 300 mg s.c. load dose regimen - Group 4 - Placebo s.c . NOTE : Group 4 split 2 treatment arm , detailed description . At randomization , subject stratify basis previous anti-TNF therapy TNFα inhibitor naïve ( TNF-naïve ) TNFα inhibitor inadequate responder ( TNF-IR ) . At study treatment visit , one ( secukinumab 150 mg ) two ( secukinumab 300 mg ) s.c. injection form PFS administer , since secukinumab available 1.0 mL ( 150 mg ) PFSs . Placebo secukinumab also available 1.0 mL match active drug . At Week 16 , subject randomize secukinumab group BSL ( Groups 1-3 ) classify either responder ( ≥20 % improvement BSL tender joint count ( TJC ) swell joint count ( SJC ) ) non-responders ( &lt; 20 % improvement BSL TJC SJC ) , however continue treatment irrespective response status . At Week 16 , subject randomize placebo BSL ( Group 4 ) classify either responder ( ≥20 % improvement BSL TJC SJC ) non-responders ( &lt; 20 % improvement BSL TJC SJC ) : - Subjects non-responders receive either secukinumab 150 mg 300 mg s.c. every 4 week start Week 16 ( dictate treatment sequence assign subject BSL ) . - Subjects responder continue receive placebo every 4 week . Starting Week 24 , subject receive either secukinumab 150 mg s.c. 300 mg s.c. every 4 week start Week 24 ( dictate treatment sequence assign subject BSL ) . At Week 24 , assessment address primary objective perform . As described , subject still receive placebo s.c. injection receive either secukinumab 150 mg s.c. 300 mg s.c. every 4 week start Week 24 ( dictate treatment sequence assign subject BSL ) . At week 52 , base Investigator 's decision , subject 150 mg dos whose sign symptoms show satisfactory response possibility allocate secukinumab 300 mg s.c. After Week 52 database lock analysis complete , site personnel subject unblinded original randomize treatment ( sequence ) assignment randomization . In addition , treatment give open-label order eliminate placebo injection . The subject continue receive active dose secukinumab open-label treatment administer Week 100 .</detailed_description>

Subjects PsA take NSAIDs least 4 week prior randomization inadequate control symptoms least one dose stop due intolerance NSAIDs.Subjects regularly take NSAIDs part PsA therapy require stable dose least 2 week study randomization remain stable dose Week 24 . Subjects take corticosteroid must stable dose ≤10 mg/day prednisone equivalent least 2 week randomization remain stable dose Week 24 . Subjects take MTX ( ≤ 25 mg/week ) allow continue medication dose stable least 4 week randomization remain stable dose Week 52 . Subjects MTX must folic acid supplementation randomization . Subjects DMARD MTX must discontinue DMARD 4 week prior randomization visit except leflunomide , discontinue 8 week prior randomization unless cholestyramine washout perform . Subjects TNFα inhibitor must experience inadequate response previous current treatment TNFα inhibitor give approve dose least 3 month stop treatment due safety/tolerability problem least one administration TNFα inhibitor . Subjects previously treat TNFα inhibitor ( investigational approve ) allow entry study appropriate washout period prior randomization Chest Xray chest MRI evidence ongoing infectious malignant process . Subjects take high potency opioid analgesic . Previous exposure secukinumab biologic drug directly target IL17 IL17 receptor . Ongoing use prohibit psoriasis treatment / medication ( e.g. , topical corticosteroid , UV therapy ) randomization . Any intramuscular intravenous intraarticular corticosteroid treatment within 4 week randomization . Subjects ever receive biologic immunomodulating agent except target TNFα ( investigational approve ) . Previous treatment celldepleting therapy include limited anti CD20 , investigational agent Other protocoldefined exclusion criterion apply</criteria>
