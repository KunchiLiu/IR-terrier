	<detailed_description>Several study perform understand cellular mechanism involve development VTE cancer patient . The pathogenesis thrombotic state link presence tumor associate development hypercoagulant state , namely coagulopathy , confers numerous advantage cancer cell . Indeed , activation coagulation cascade aggregation blood platelet around cancer cell protect immune response ; facilitate circulation bloodstream adhesion potential site metastasis . Beside implication activation coagulation , TF/FVIIa complex also influence pathways activate cell-bound protease activate receptor ( PARs ) lead activation inflammatory angiogenic response . Furthermore , soluble variant TF , know alternatively splice TF ( asTF ) stimulate angiogenesis independent FVIIa . This lead model presence Tissue Factor ( TF ) , generation thrombin platelet activation directly participate cancer progression dissemination . The presence TF activation platelet participate progression tumor . A retrospective study collect clinical information plasma sample 117 patient pancreatic biliary cancer , 68 % pancreatic cancer 29 % biliary cancer . Thrombotic event occur 52 ( 44.4 % ) patient . Mean median tissue factor patient 2.15 pg/mL 1.20 pg/mL , respectively ( range : 0.17-31.01 pg/mL ) . Elevated Tissue Factor level significantly associate VTE event ( P=0.04 ) , elevate tissue Factor level associate bad overall survival ( hazard ratio , HR : 1.05 ; P=0.01 ) . This procoagulant state could due expression active TF transmembrane protein ( PSGL-1 , Muc1 , … ) cancer cell cancer cell-derived microparticles lead platelet activation aggregation . While study key role TF bear cancer cell-derived microparticles cancer associate thrombosis , investigator previously show ( Dubois C , INSERM UMR 1076 Marseille ) endogenously generate exogenously inject pancreatic cancer cell-derived microparticles express TF ( PancO2 ) , parental tumor cell , accumulate site injury P-selectin dependent manner . Their presence directly correlate size thrombus . Based data , investigator first hypothesize treatment anticoagulant / antiplatelet drug may prevent tumor progression formation metastasis , well thrombosis associate cancer , addition prevention coagulopathy . Then Dubois &amp; al compare effect inhibitor platelet activation , Clopidogrel , inhibitor activation coagulant cascade , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) tumor growth thrombosis associate cancer . Concentrations drug use calculate induce 50 % reduction thrombus formation follow laser-induced injury healthy mouse . A diminution kinetics tumor growth observe mice treat 2 drug comparison non-treated mouse . Twenty day follow injection cancer cell , volume tumor reduce 85 % 87 % LMHW Clopidogrel use , respectively . However , kinetics tumor growth volume tumor 20 day post-injection similar mouse treat Clopidogrel presence absence pathological TF express cancer cell . Cancer cell-derived microparticles responsible thrombotic phenotype observe mice develop cancer via interaction P-selectin express aggregate platelet activate endothelium PSGL-1 present surface cancer cell-derived microparticles . Before injury infusion bloodstream , exogenous label cancer cell-derived microparticles detect cremaster microcirculation non-treated Clopidogrel treat mouse . However , follow injury , cancer cell-derived microparticles accumulate site thrombus formation non-treated mouse bear PancO2-LowTF High TF tumor . Tissue Factor ( TF ) main effector coagulation cascade protein involved development solid tumor . In vivo , follow laser-induced injury , activation endothelial wall , well presence activate platelet , main source P-selectin . The quantity P-selectin present site injury 4 fold less important mouse bear PancO2 tumor treat Clopidogrel comparison non-treated mouse . Interestingly , PanCO2 cancer cell-derived microparticles express TF TFPI ( Tissue Factor Inhibitor ) , biological inhibitor coagulation cascade active form . To confirm cancer-cell derived microparticles may participate inhibition blood coagulation observe pathological TF shut , investigator compare fibrin generation site injury PancO2-High TF Low-TF cancer mouse presence absence Clopidogrel . Fibrin formation site laser-induced injury significantly important ( P &lt; 0,01 ) mouse follow injection Panc02-High TF comparison wild type mouse . Treatment mouse Clopidogrel diminish production fibrin level comparable one observe wild type mouse . When pathological TF shut , production fibrin strongly reduce comparison group mouse inject Panc02 cell group wild type mouse . investigator conclude cancer cell cancer cell-derived microparticles express active TF , incorporation grow thrombus participates generation thrombotic phenotype . When TF express cancer cell shut , cancer cell microparticles still incorporate site thrombus formation , reduce activation TF , inhibit fibrin generation thrombus formation bring TFPI site injury . Based observation , investigator hypothesize inhibition platelet activation reduce thrombosis associate cancer tumor growth could constitute interesting therapy treat cancer thrombosis . To test hypothesis investigator develop syngeneic orthoptic model pancreatic cancer could confirm mice treat Clopidogrel Aspirin , growth primary tumor significantly reduce development metastasis limit ( Mege et al. ) . However benefit aspirin observe mice treat immediately time onset cancer , id est injection cancer cell perform . On contrary , effect clopidogrel obtain independently tumor size , tumor development onset even cancer advance stage . Altogether action anti-platelet drug thrombosis , result indicate Clopidogrel represent promise therapeutic drug limit thrombosis reduce development tumor metastasis . The investigator show experimental model TF express cancer cell involve thrombosis associate cancer growth tumor vivo . Beside function coagulation , TF also describe follow phosphorylation bind cytoplasmic tail filamin , induce transcriptional activation different growth factor , include VEGF . This intracellular pathway may also participate growth tumor , also angiogenesis . Furthermore , TF expression also report influence motility , survival proliferation cancer cell via activation PAR-1 PAR-2 , although study proliferation Panc02 cell affect inhibition TF expression . Cancer cell may directly activate platelet secrete ADP , Thromboxane A2 MMP-2 ( Matrix Metallo Proteinase 2 ) express surface ligands platelet , PSGL-1 . In bloodstream , lead aggregation platelet around cancer cell describe protect destruction immune system , blood shear stress facilitate cancer cell interaction endothelium . However , direct involvement platelet agonist demonstrate vivo . When mouse treat LMWH , decrease tumor development observe similar one obtain pathological TF shut . Also , treatment Clopidogrel significantly affect growth tumor group Panc02 miRNA TF mouse group Panc02 mice treat LMWH . This strongly suggest activation platelet involve growth tumor , also main activator platelet TF express cancer cell ADP Thromboxane A2 . These secondary agonist may involve secreted consequence platelet activation generate thrombin TF dependent pathway . Last , may play important role directly growth tumor , rather formation metastasis cancer cell present bloodstream .</detailed_description>
