	<brief_title>Evaluation Cemented Cementless Fixation Dual-mobility Hip Prosthesis Elderly Patients With Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Elderly Hip Patient The proportion elderly Danish population increase functional level generally good , despite health problem , intensifies demand primary definitive ( one-stage ) safe surgical treatment case osteoarthritis fragility low-energy displace femoral neck fracture . Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) one successful procedure modern orthopaedic surgery achieve pain relief restore normal walk ability preoperative painful stiff hip joint . Bone Quality THA surgical technique Osteoporosis ( brittle bone ) define chronic systemic skeletal disease characterize low bone mineral density ( osteopenia ) microarchitecture change trabecular bone structure result reduced strength therefore increase risk fracture . Among Danish woman 65 year age , prevalence osteoporosis 40-60 % , prevalence among men increase . Much effort put secondary fracture prophylaxis vitamin D calcium well medical bone anti-resorptive treatment ( i.e . bisphosphonates ) . When bone weak/osteoporotic general undocumented recommendation cement uncemented THA fixation . It show uncemented hip stem migrate cemented component osteopenic osteoporotic bone wherefore cement stem fixation recommend . However , Danish hip surgeon favour uncemented fixation even fragile osteoporotic elderly reduces surgical time , minimizes risk intraoperative cement disease/fat embolism dead , make revision surgery case infection peri-prosthetic fracture easy re-operate . In 2012 , 7364 acetabular cup insert uncemented versus 1015 uncemented - indication THA Denmark . Reoperation hip within 2 year primary THA due new femoral neck fracture complication follow treatment proximal femoral fracture 4.7 % . There clinical conviction cement cup easier place correct inclination anteversion position . However , due posterior-lateral overhang dual mobility cup postero-lateral edge-cementation likely insufficient lead micromotion aseptic loosening . In clinical experience lesser risk cementless cup . Compared Nordic country , Denmark low incidence aseptic cup loosen 34.8 % respectively 47.3 % 50.4 % Norway Sweden . The reason revision due dislocation 33.5 % Denmark compare Norway Sweden , respectively 23.8 % 23.4 % may relate overall difference surgical approach ( postero-lateral approach Denmark antero-lateral approach Norway Sweden ) . Approximately 96 % operate posterior approach Denmark whereas 23.8 % 60.3 % operate posterior approach Norway Sweden , respectively . Dual-mobility articulation concept In 1974 Professor Bousquet develop dual-mobility ( DM ) hip articulation concept reduce wear , restore near-normal motion-range hip joint , time increase hip prosthesis stability . The dual-mobility hip articulation design consist large non-fixed polyethylene liner slide freely within metal cup-shell fix bone , inside mobile liner second articulation small femoral head . The dual-articulation prosthetic joint prevents impingement femoral neck acetabular rim implant . Studies show dual-mobility hip prosthesis good survival rate reduce dislocation rate patient primary osteoarthritis hip lesser compliant patient group displace femoral neck fracture . Clinical expectation dual-mobility articulation concept treatment displace medial FNF good ; however , publication available study implant fixation / cup migration . It important study dislocation risk well mechanical stability bony fixation since advantage low dislocation rate would meaningless cup loosen mechanically surround bone mid- long term . Femoral Neck Fracture THA THA may use primary treatment option displace medial femoral neck fracture ( FNF ) . Compared screw osteosynthesis , THA result stable fracture treatment less post-operative pain faster mobilization displace medial FNF few complication . The common complication THA treatment old perhaps memory-impaired patient dislocation instability . At Regional Hospital Holstebro result Saturne速 Dual-Mobility THA patient group ( n &gt; 500 ) last 7 year propose risk THA hip dislocation high-risk patient 5 % . In 2012 , 10,309 patient admitted Danish hospital femoral fracture . Approximately 600 hip fracture patient treat THA . Patients hip fracture resource intensive require approximative 2.2 % hospital bed day Denmark . Furthermore , elderly , average age 80 year high co-morbidity percentage also high mortality risk approximately 10 % within first 30 day FNF . The one-year mortality 15-25 % . Reoperations frequency depend fracture type operative treatment , varies per cent insertion THA 25 % osteosynthesis . Often acute chronic medical condition cause elderly low energy fall result hip fracture , may also accidental related osteoporosis . Radiostereometric Analysis ( RSA ) Mechanical loosen prosthesis may suspect prosthesis migrates relative underlying adjacent bone . Therefore , consensus introduction new prosthesis new operational method prosthesis insertion evaluate migration study recommend use general . Clinical study show high predictive power early migration joint prosthesis later prosthesis loosen premature revision . Radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) accurate method assessment cup migration precision level 0.11 mm precision well . Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) The clinical survival joint prosthesis depend quality surround bone bone mineral density ( BMD ) important measure bone strength quality . The periprosthetic bone density measure Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) , precise method measure even small change BMD around hip prosthesis . Patients expose little dose radiation study scan take minute . Typically , four five scan take 2 5 year follow-up . For assessment bone surround acetabular cup 3 DeLee zone 4 Wilkinson Zones often use , Gruen zone use assesment around stem . Bone density define osteopenic bone T-score &lt; 1.0 - &gt; 2.5 , whereas osteoporotic T-score &lt; 2.5 severe osteoporosis &lt; 4.0 . It possible register bone resorption around implant DXA resorption become visible conventional x-ray film form `` radiolucent line '' ( RLL ) . It important monitor remodelling periprosthetic bone decrease BMD may weaken prosthetic fixation lead failure . It known BMD decrease initially implant surgery stabilize periode year . Polywear The acetabular plastic component polyethylene ( PE ) wear particle stimulate biologic response production various inflammatory mediator , stimulate migration leucocytes tissue activate collagen synthesis , stimulate osteoclast resorb bone contribute osteolysis . Reports suggest hydroxyapatite ( HA ) coat implant use cementless hip replacement contribute inferior survival medium- thickness spray-dried HA-coated cup individual case excessive PE wear premature cup failure . The concept dual-mobility cup provide theoretical question whether double articulation lead wear hence early revision , especially young active patient . It previously show two-dimentional ( 2D ) wear polyethylene 0.1 mm / year may lead osteolysis loosen prosthetic component , deteriorate prosthesis durability . Wear hip prosthesis polyethylene accurately measure ( 0.09 mm ) software PolyWare 3D Pro Digital Version digital clinical antero-posterior radiograph hip prosthesis . Study design method Comparison prosthesis migration cement versus uncemented dual-mobility cup fixation Objective : Investigate prosthesis migration polyethylene wear cement cementless Avantage速 dual-mobility acetabular component ( Biomet Inc. ) elderly patient correlate migration measurement radiological evaluation implant placement/cementation quality , bone quality time surgery ( osteoporotic/osteopenic/normal bone ) , functional outcome two year . The migration pattern magnitude predict likelihood later aseptic loosening revision . Design : Prospective randomize patient-blinded clinical trial . Hypotheses : 1 . More stable fixation cement compare uncemented cup ( initially 1-2 year ) . 2 . Acceptable cement coverage postero-lateral acetabular rim ( 95 % ) case . 3 . Low polyethylene wear-rate ( &lt; 0.1mm/year bedding-in first 3 month ) . 4 . Similar periprosthetic pelvic bone loss ( Wilkinson zone ) irrespective fixation method . 5 . Low dislocation risk irrespective fixation method ( &lt; 1 % ) . 6 . Patient satisfaction &gt; 90 % general . Patients : The Avantage速 cup use elderly patient department include patient displace medial FNF patient primary osteoarthritis . It may also use revision surgery case dislocation complication . Acute patient FNF difficult include study pre-study investigation necessitate patient FNF difficult inform ( pain morphine drug ) difficult give proper time consider study participation perhaps call assessor help make decision . A big drop due difficult circumstance project-information consent could serious selection bias could also prolong inclusion period seriously . Mortality FNF patient high pose risk many patient lose follow-up 5-year study period therefore demand high estimate sample size .
