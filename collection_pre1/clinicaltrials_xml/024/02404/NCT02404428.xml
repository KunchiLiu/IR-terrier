	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer major public health problem strong need new preventive strategy base drug lifestyle intervention . It well-established healthy eating pattern increase physical activity prevent delay prostate cancer progression . Intake cruciferous vegetable ( e.g . broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , Brussels sprout , kale ) associate decrease risk prostate cancer progression ; however underlie biological mechanism remain unknown . The investigator propose undertake pilot study group men early prostate cancer active surveillance determine whether diet rich broccoli induce change tumor size blood flow measure conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) technique . Men early prostate cancer active surveillance visible cancer lesion MRI recruit onto double-blinded randomized intervention ask eat one portion broccoli soup per week 6 month . The investigator test two variety broccoli ( standard 'Beneforte extra ' broccoli ) able deliver two different level sulforaphane ( SF ) , active compound extensively study potential anticancer property . This study involve MRI scan , blood urine collection 6 month intervention period . This study design allow u observe diet-induced change within prostate also systemic level . In addition , participant 's lifestyle ( habitual diet physical activity ) assess food diary exercise questionnaires . This study fund Biotechnology Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) Prostate Cancer foundation ( PCF ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomise double-blinded dietary intervention study . The study population consist men ( n=20 ) age 18-80 year BMI 19.5 35 kg/m2 low risk prostate cancer ( prostate specific antigen [ PSA ] &lt; 10ng/ml ; Gleason grade 6 ; T category T1 T2 ) intermediate risk prostate cancer patient ( PSA 10-20ng/ml ; Gleason 7 ( include select 4+3 case advise radical prostatectomy ; T category T1 T2 ) visible lesion MRI already decide take active surveillance/monitoring . The investigator choose inclusion criterion reflect population men active surveillance investigator currently recruit ESCAPE study ( Effect Sulforaphane Prostate CAncer PrEvention ; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01950143 ) via Norfolk Norwich University Hospital . Volunteers recruit onto study randomly allocate one two arm require consume one portion broccoli soup per week , deliver different level glucoraphanin ( SF precursor ) study arm . This part normal diet 6 month . The two soup contain standard broccoli ( ) , glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli name study 'Beneforte extra ' ( ii ) . The study involve MRI monitoring baseline 6 month . In addition investigator collect blood urine sample baseline 6 month . The volunteer ' habitual diet physical activity also assess intervention period .</detailed_description>
