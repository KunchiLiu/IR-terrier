	<brief_summary>Breast cancer frequent malignancy woman , world-wide lead cause cancer mortality . One strong risk factor develop breast cancer age , prevalence approach 7 % woman &gt; 70 year ; 40 % breast cancer patient older 65 year . Although survival rate increase last year , one third patient relapse distant metastasis . Treatment patient metastatic breast cancer palliative , therefore maintain improve quality life . The use taxanes anthracyclines first line chemotherapy regimen metastatic breast cancer widely accept . Both taxanes anthracyclines considerable side effect , especially elderly patient . Eribulin , synthetic analogue chemotherapeutically active compound derive sea sponge Halichondria okadai , act inhibitor microtubule dynamic . It register palliative chemotherapy advance breast cancer anthracyclines taxanes . Studies eribulin treatment show similar efficacy compare anthracyclines taxanes , less toxicity . Those study show often dose eribulin reduce treatment due toxicity without compromise efficacy treatment . The main objective trial explore efficacy reduce start dose eribulin first-line treatment elderly metastatic breast cancer patient . The secondary objective trial investigate safety eribulin patient . Eribulin mesilate 1.1mg/m2 i.v . administer intravenously every 3 week day 1 day 8 progressive disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin 1st Line Treatment Elderly Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due rise number elderly patient , fit chemotherapy , investigate well-tolerated effective first line treatment warrant . In specific population often contra-indications use standard first line drug like anthracyclines taxanes due comorbidities ( e.g . cardiac impairment Peripheral neuropathy ) . Response rate first line treatment taxanes anthracyclines usually exceed 30 % . Eribulin show response rate 29 % clinical benefit rate ( correspond investigator primary endpoint ) 52 % first line , investigator expect similar efficacy , less toxicity . Optimal dose , schedule tolerability drug first line set unknown elderly population . No information dose modification population available . Based data eribulin first line high efficacy patient dose reduction , SAKK 25/14 trial investigates reduce starting-dose eribulin 1.1mg/m2 vulnerable population elderly patient . Growth factor maintain certain dose level eribulin recommend , respect international guideline . SAKK tradition conduct trial elderly population , SAKK 25/99 metastatic breast cancer , SAKK 38/08 aggressive B-cell-Lymphoma , SAKK 41/10 metastatic colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
