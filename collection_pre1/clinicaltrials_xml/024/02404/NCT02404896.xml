	<brief_summary>Metreleptin approve United States adjunct diet replacement therapy treat complication leptin deficiency patient congenital acquire generalized lipodystrophy February 2014 . The approval base result obtain 2 open-label , investigator-sponsored study ( Studies 991265 20010769 ) conduct National Institutes Health ( NIH ) evaluate safety efficacy metreleptin treatment patient lipodystrophy 1 treatment IND ( FHA101/MB002-002/MB002-002 ) conduct Bristol-Myers Squibb behalf AstraZeneca ( BMS/AZ ) patient diabetes mellitus and/or hypertriglyceridemia relate lipodystrophy . These study enrol patient lipodsytrophy include generalize partial lipodystrophy . Although market authorization restrict indication patient generalize lipodystrophy , meaningful clinical benefit achieve subset patient partial lipodystrophy , patient FHA101/MB002-002 form basis request ongoing treatment expand access .</brief_summary>
