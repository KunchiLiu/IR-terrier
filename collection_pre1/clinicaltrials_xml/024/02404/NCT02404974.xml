	<brief_title>Using Web-based Tools Facilitate Tailored Exercise People With Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize feasible acceptable identify people knee pain osteoarthritis ( OA ) interest individualized exercise program web-based osteoarthritis treatment diagnosis application ; ass exercise barrier , facilitator , motivator preference ; engage exercise program tailor meet need Certified Fitness Trainer . The investigator accomplish : 1 . Evaluating feasibility identify patient use web-based preference diagnosis tool ( PDx ) knee pain osteoarthritis meet exercise guideline interested tailored exercise program ; 2 . Evaluating feasibility acceptability use self-report assessment tool identify barrier , facilitator , motivator , preference exercise screen participant health problem limit ability exercise safely ; 3 . Evaluating feasibility potential effectiveness use exercise assessment tool patient knee pain osteoarthritis select individualized exercise program help Certified Fitness Trainer engage routine physical exercise . 3 . Study Design Study design : The investigator use pre-post pilot study design . The assessment hold either Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ( One Medical Center Drive , Lebanon NH 03756 ) , The Dartmouth Centers Health Aging ( 46 Centerra Parkway , Lebanon , NH 03766 ) . Assessments conduct principal investigator ( PI ) , and/or research assistant ( RA ) . Consent approval Committee Protections Human Subjects Dartmouth College obtain prior start study . Volunteer non-exercising under-exercising participant age 50-85 recruited flyer provider referral . Recruitment continue 10 participant answer `` yes '' exercise question PDx . Written inform consent obtain participant . Aim 1 Methods : Feasibility identify patient use web-based preference diagnosis tool ( PDx ) knee pain osteoarthritis exercise recommend level interested tailor exercise program . Volunteer participant screen RA eligibility study . Demographics age sex record screening . After obtain write informed consent , eligible participant complete Preference Diagnosis ( PDx ) web-based software program respond `` yes '' `` '' question `` I interested exercise program tailor meet need '' end program . PDx software application development The Dartmouth Center Health Care Delivery Science ( TDC ) use weighted value patient assessment perceive unfavorable aspect `` cost '' , versus perceive benefit , develop profile preference around knee OA treatment . An RA ( trained Catalina Gorla TDC administer PDx ) coach participant use PDx program administer lap top computer private room . All participant height , weight , waist circumference measure prior start application use standardize protocol . Feasibility assess proportion potentially eligible participant endorse exercise question within 3-month period maximum 10 reach . Aim 2 Methods : Feasibility acceptability use self-report assessment identify barrier , facilitator , motivator , preference exercise screen participant health problem limit ability exercise safely . Participants answer `` yes '' exercise question ( final question tool ) immediately complete self-report screen tool : Exercise Barriers , Facilitators , Motivators , Preferences Older Adults ( appendix A ) .24 The exercise assessment tool currently iterative development incorporate expertise Certified Fitness Trainer . Participants age 69 less also complete Personal Assessment Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) ( appendix B ) .21 As PAR-Q validate adult 69 year , participant answer yes question ( excpetion question 5 ) PAR-Q older 69 complete medical screening prior participation exercise portion study . If question 5 ( Do bone joint problem ( example , back , knee hip ) could make bad change physical activity ? ) PAR-Q endorse , follow question ask : 1 . Do bone joint problem osteoarthritis knee ? If , allow participate study ; If yes , ask : 2 . Do inflammatory arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis , Psoriatic Arthritis , Gout , Infectious Arthritis , Lyme disease ? If yes , excluded participation . 3 . If uncertain , refer medical screening prior participation . The RA assist participant complete assessment , need , help arrange medical follow . Feasibility assess proportion participant answer `` yes '' exercise question complete Barriers , Facilitators , Motivators Preferences screen PAR-Q and/or medical screening . Acceptability assess qualitative semi-structured one-hour interview 10 participant 3 month conduct RA base upon question develop research team ( Appendix D ) . Interviews transcribe , de-indentified , cod analyze theme use ground theory . Aim 3 Methods : Feasibility potential effectiveness use self-report exercise assessment patient knee pain OA select individualized exercise program engage routine physical exercise support Certified Fitness Trainer . Participants meet Certified Fitness Trainer engage share goal set selection CDC-recommended exercise program OA best fit need preference , specifically address identify barrier . The Trainer use program vet list program appropriate old adult knee OA , modify need . This list develop Certified Fitness Trainer PI . The Trainer available answer question contact participant phone every two week find participant ; make adjustment program , need ; provide motivation encouragement . Feasibility evaluate quantify proportion participant complete assessment within 3-month period . Potential effectiveness evaluate base pre-post difference mean number self-reported minute spend mild , moderate , vigorous exercise previous week ; proportion participant adopt exercise routine , change health goal attainment confidence . Pain measured 10 cm visual analog scale collect exploratory measure . ( see description measure ) .</detailed_description>
