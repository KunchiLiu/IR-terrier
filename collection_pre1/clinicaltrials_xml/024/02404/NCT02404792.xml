	<detailed_description>The primary objective proposal compare moderate high intensity exercise intervention improve physical function person age HIV . Both HIV-infected HIV-uninfected older adult assign moderate intensity cardiovascular resistance training intervention 12 week , randomize either continue moderate intensity exercise , increase high intensity exercise additional 12 week . The primary outcome impact exercise physical function , measure overall score modify Short Physical Performance Battery ( mSPPB ) chair rise time mSPPB . The secondary outcome include change insulin-like growth factor-1 ( systemic local ) inflammation ( interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 2 ( sTNFR-1 sTNFR-2 ) ) .</detailed_description>
