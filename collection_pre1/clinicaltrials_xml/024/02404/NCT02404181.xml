	<brief_summary>Delirium common disorder hospitalize patient , nevertheless poorly recognize physician nurse , even screen instrument use . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) appear sensitive tool diagnosis delirium . However , standard EEG record 25 electrode labor intensive . We previously show brief EEG registration three electrode automatic process distinguish patient delirium patient without delirium well . However , finding need validate unselected population . The primary objective validation study investigate sensitivity , specificity , predictive value EEG-based delirium monitor ( include three electrode reference electrode ) compare delirium quantification frail elderly patient surgery . In international multicenter study , 154 frail elderly patient include undergo elective surgery expect remain admitted least two postoperative day . Patients exclude communication possible admitted neurological surgery . A five minute EEG registration delirium monitor four electrode perform prior surgery three consecutive day surgery discharge . Within one hour EEG recording , delirium assessment perform recorded video , evaluate delirium expert . The relative delta power ( calculated one minute artifact-free EEG segment ) compare conclusion delirium expert .</brief_summary>
