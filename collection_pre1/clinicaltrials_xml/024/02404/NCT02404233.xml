	<brief_summary>Current HIV treatment guideline recommend use triple-drug therapy ( two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor either protease inhibitor , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , integrase inhibitor ) treatment antiretroviral ( ARV ) -naïve patient . With introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , patient HIV live much longer . With increase lifespan person HIV , long-term complication therapy well occurrence co-morbidities age prompted HCPs re-think current treatment paradigm consider novel combination ARVs . All currently approve HIV antiretrovirals implicate cause long-term toxicity ; however great body evidence long-term metabolic effect implicate nucleoside reverse transcriptase ( NRTI ) class . By utilize non-NRTI treatment regimen , hypothesize many long-term metabolic effect ( renal toxicity , bone loss , body fat change ) delay avoid altogether . The clinical data novel combination currently limit rapidly grow include several combination utilized darunavir . This study first kind use unique combination darunavir/cobicistat rilpivirine . Currently , drug combination recommend option first time treatment HIV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label , Pilot Study Darunavir Boosted Cobicistat Combination With Rilpivirine Treat HIV+ Naïve Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IV , 48-week , open-label , pilot study 30 ARV-naïve patient examine safety , viral response , tolerability darunavir/cobicistat combination rilpivirine daily treatment HIV treatment-naïve patient . Thirty subject meet inclusion criterion study select single site . All 30 subject receive darunavir/cobicistat 800/150mg combination rilpivirine 25 mg daily study onset follow 48 week start study medication . Virologic failure define failure achieve HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL week 24 therapy , patient baseline HIV-1 RNA &gt; 100,000 copies/mL , failure achieve 1 log10 reduction HIV-1 RNA week 24 . Confirmed virologic failure define two consecutive HIV RNA level ≥50 copies/mL suppression &lt; 50 copies/mL two consecutive measurement . Patients confirm virologic failure discontinue study switch new antiretroviral treatment regimen . Patients decide initiate treatment consultation physician careful review Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) guideline treatment consider enrollment research subject . Individuals consider enrollment provide informed consent ( See Appendix A ) screen , eligible , enrol study . Adherence study regimen symptoms hypersensitivity reaction monitor self-report study visit . Adherence assess use standard ACTG Adherence Questionnaire II ( See Appendix B ) , either telephone clinic visit . Those patient report problem adherence counsel monitor closely every 4 week clinic visit phone consultation bi-weekly adherence improves . If despite counseling , adherence maintain , patient discontinue study due increase risk drug resistance . AEs monitor closely determine appropriate management affect tolerability adherence , i.e. , prescribe anti-emetic anti-diarrhea medication nausea diarrhea , respectively . Patients counsel importance adherence every study visit . Hematology , blood chemistry , liver function test , virologic immunologic measurement obtain baseline ( week 0 ) , week 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . In addition blood chemistry evaluation , fast blood sample obtain baseline week 24 48 triglyceride , total cholesterol , direct HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol . Pancreatic amylase serum lipase level determine serum amylase result &gt; 2x ULN ( see Section 5.4.2 Laboratory Evaluations ) . In subset 12 subject baseline least 24 week exposure darunavir rilpivirine lumbar puncture perform obtain sample CSF viral load , cell count darunavir rilpivirine concentration . Adherence counsel perform HIV-1 RNA measurement &gt; 400 copies/mL . New combination therapy HIV initiate upon evidence develop resistance face virologic failure . Samples flow cytometry ( include limit absolute percent CD4+ CD8+ cell count ) HIV RNA level obtain study visit . The Roche Amplicor 1.5v ( LOQ= 50 copies/mL ) use patient achieve HIV RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL time HIV RNA PCR ( LOQ=50 copies/mL ) assay use . It note test outside specify protocol , conduct without additional write informed consent . LabCorps America Monogram Phenosense GT perform patient baseline patient confirm virologic failure ( two consecutive HIV RNA level ≥400 copies/mL suppression &lt; 400 copies/mL two consecutive measurement ) . Due test reliability , HIV RNA must ≥1000 copies/mL order obtain genotype . In patient HIV RNA &gt; 500 &lt; 1,000 copies/mL , test may unsuccessful discretion investigator . Genotypes utilized use clinical management.12subjects baseline least 24 week exposure darunavir rilpivirine sample CSF viral load , cell count darunavir rilpivirine concentration perform LabCorps America University California , San Diego , CA Assessment facial lipoatrophy , central adiposity , breast hypertrophy , dorsal fat pad ( `` buffalo hump '' ) , multiple lipoma , Cushingoid appearance without Cushing 's disease perform physician assessment self-report baseline , week 24 , 48 , premature discontinuation . Patients develop study drug-related Grade 1 2 AE clinical laboratory abnormality may elect continue study medication . Patients develop study drug-related Grade 3 AE clinical laboratory abnormality , exception hyperglycemia , hypertriglyceridemia , hypercholesterolemia , Grade 3 AST/ALT elevation , may interrupt offend study medication ( ) base discretion investigator . If rilpivirine determine likely likely cause , darunavir/cobicistat may continue one additional week due long half-life rilpivirine ( ~40 hour ) prevent functional monotherapy . Patients develop study drug-related Grade 4 AE clinical laboratory abnormality , exception hyperglycemia , hypertriglyceridemia , hypercholesterolemia , interrupt study medication , regardless half-life . Upon resolution AE clinical laboratory abnormality within one grade level ( exceed Grade 2 ) patient 's baseline level , patient may resume study drug dose guidance investigator .
