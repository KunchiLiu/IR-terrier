	<detailed_description>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) study test new HIV vaccine combination . HIV virus cause AIDS . The investigator study answer several question : - Are study vaccine safe give people ? - Are people able take study vaccine without become uncomfortable ? - How people 's immune system respond study vaccine ? ( Your immune system protect disease . ) The study use 2 different vaccine : ALVAC-HIV ( vCP2438 ) bivalent gp120/MF59 . These experimental HIV vaccine -- investigator know whether vaccine safe use people , whether work prevent HIV infection . These vaccine use research study . The ALVAC vaccine make canarypox virus , infect bird grow human cell . This virus small bit man-made DNA insert . DNA natural substance find living thing , include people virus . The canarypox virus help get DNA body 's cell . The DNA tell cell make small amount proteins look like one find HIV . A study South Africa , HVTN 097 , give similar ALVAC vaccine 80 participant . So far , one serious health problem . The Protein vaccine man-made piece protein find outside HIV . These protein piece mixed adjuvant call MF59 . An adjuvant something add vaccine help immune system respond well . MF59 include vaccine give 50,000 people clinical trial without cause serious health problem . This combination study vaccine give people . However , similar ALVAC protein vaccine give 10,000 people clinical trial without cause serious health problem . Also , 300 people receive similar combination ALVAC protein vaccine MF59 adjuvant clinical trial without serious health problem . About 252 people take part study multiple site . The US National Institutes Health ( NIH ) pay study . The study require 14 clinic visit 18 month .</detailed_description>
