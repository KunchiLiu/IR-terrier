	<detailed_description>Elderly people fast grow segment population . As geriatric population continue rise , consequence fall fall-related injury carry increase socioeconomic significance . One-third community- dwell elderly fall year ; 5 % experience fracture injury require hospitalization expense exceed $ 20 billion annually . The common activity perform time fall-related hip fracture walk forward turn around . Although 40 % hip fracture occur walk 18 % occur turning . Cumming &amp; Klineberg find fall turn 7.9 time likely result hip fracture fall walk straight . This evidence suggest turn great challenge individual mobility problem walk straight ahead . Hence , turn carry significant risk hip fracture . Nearly every daily activity require locomotion require turn , yet gait research focus straight ahead walking.Glaister et al ( 2007 ) show straight walking make majority step take four daily live task observe , non-straight step still make approximately 35-45 % step take typical day . An important common component mobility change travel direction walk . Turning require central nervous system coordinate whole-body reorientation toward new travel direction , continue on-going step cycle . Balance maintenance turn involves complex integration multiple sensory system ( vestibular , visual , somatosensory ) motor output . Aging associate slow progressive decline sensory motor system well integrative function . Turning affect low limb kinematics , kinetics , step length . Significant age difference find among healthy young old adult subject ability quickly turn stop order avoid obstacles suddenly appear ; gait path much old adult ' need longer response time young attributable lengthen first phase response . Standing turn performance use delineate elderly faller non-fallers . Dite &amp; Temple ( 2002 ) show old adult multiple fall past six month take average two step complete 180 turn compare old adult one fall.Authors record basic temporospatial aspect turn walking.These category : ( 1 ) type turn ( strategy ) use accomplish turn , ( 2 ) number step take turn , ( 3 ) time take accomplish turn , ( 4 ) stagger turn . These category find reliable valid clinical measure turn walk old adult . Specific turn item find discriminate group healthy impaired old adult good sensitivity identify multiple faller . Thigpen et al ( 2000 ) confirm result . The purpose current study explore validity TURN180 test distinguish Non faller , Fallers Multiple faller elderly population compare know gold standard clinical test : Timed `` Up Go '' test ( TUG ) , Tinetti Balance Test ( Tinetti ) , Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) . According reviewed literature TURN180 test sensitive age change delineate elderly faller non-fallers . If , could quick , practical low-cost test identify danger fall estimate change fallowing intervention . This validation study balance mobility test use three-group sample convenience .</detailed_description>
