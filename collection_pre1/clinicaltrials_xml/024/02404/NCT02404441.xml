	<brief_summary>The purpose `` first-in-human '' study PDR001 characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) antitumor activity PDR001 administer i.v . single agent adult patient solid tumor . By block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 , PDR001 inhibit PD-1 immune checkpoint , result activation antitumor immune response activate effector T-cells inhibit regulatory T-cells . This study design phase I/II , multi-center , open-label study start phase I dose escalation part follow phase II part . PDR001 administer every 2 week patient experience unacceptable toxicity , progressive disease per immune relate Response Criteria ( irRC ) and/or treatment discontinue discretion investigator patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must obtain prior screen procedure Phase I part : Patients advanced/metastatic solid tumor , measurable nonmeasurable disease determine RECIST version 1.1 ( refer Appendix 1 ) , progress despite standard therapy intolerant standard therapy , standard therapy exists . Phase II part : Patients advanced/metastatic solid tumor , least one measurable lesion determine RECIST version 1.1 , progress follow last prior therapy , fit one follow group : Group 1a 1b : NSCLC : Patients NSCLC must disease recurrence progression one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen ( platinum doubletbased ) advance metastatic disease . Prior maintenance therapy allow ( e.g . pemetrexed , erlotinib , bevacizumab ) . Only patient EGFR mutationnegative tumor eligible ( defined negative exon 19 deletion L858R mutation EGFR minimum ; however , extensive EGFR mutation test perform , tumor must harbor know activate EGFR mutation Exons 1821 order consider EGFR mutationnegative ) . All patient must test EGFR mutational status , ALK translocation status mutation detect EGFR . Patients ALK translocationpositive NSCLC must disease progression follow treatment correspond inhibitor one systemic chemotherapy regimen ( platinum doubletbased ) , sequence . Group 2 : Melanoma : All patient must test BRAF mutation . Patients V600 mutation positive melanoma must clinical radiological evidence disease progression treatment BRAF inhibitor alone combination agent . Group 3 : Triple negatice breast cancer . Group 4 : Anaplastic thyroid cancer ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 . Patients must site disease amenable biopsy , candidate tumor biopsy . Patient must willing undergo new tumor biopsy baseline molecular prescreening applicable , therapy study . For patient phase II part study , exception may grant documented discussion Novartis . After sufficient number pair biopsy collect , decision may take stop collection biopsy . History severe hypersensitivity reaction mAbs Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Active infection require systemic antibiotic therapy . HIV infection . Active HBV HCV infection . Patients ocular melanoma . Systemic anticancer therapy within 2 week first dose study treatment . For cytotoxic agent major delay toxicity , e.g . mitomycin C nitrosoureas , 4 week washout period . For patient receive anticancer immunotherapy CTLA4 antagonist , 6 week indicate washout period . Prior PD1 PDL1directed therapy . Patients require chronic treatment systemic steroid therapy , replacementdose steroid set adrenal insufficiency . Topical , inhale , nasal ophthalmic steroid prohibit . Patients receive systemic treatment immunosuppressive medication ( steroid describe ) . Use vaccines infectious disease ( e.g . influenza , varicella , pneumococcus ) within 4 week initiation study treatment . Presence ≥ CTCAE grade 2 toxicity ( except alopecia , peripheral neuropathy ototoxicity , exclude ≥ CTCAE grade 3 ) due prior cancer therapy Other protocol define Inclusion/Exclusion may apply .</criteria>
