	<brief_title>Acute Effects Canagliflozin , Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) Inhibitor Bone Metabolism Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Canagliflozin new oral drug treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , one two recently FDA approve sodium glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitor , target renal glucose reabsorption offer promise improvement HbA1c . In approval process , FDA Advisory Committee review data suggest canagliflozin increase incidence fracture . In addition , drug induce change phosphate , bone resorption marker , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) vitamin D metabolism might mediate adverse change bone homeostasis . For variety reason , data bone fracture risk relatively limited . First , drug development program focus primarily demonstrate efficacy , bone fracture one many safety end-points monitor . Second , minority patient ( approximately 1 % ) experience bone fracture course development program . Finally , appear lag time prior time increase bone resorption translate significant increase rate bone fracture . We hypothesize class drug cause cascade hormonal change induce increased phosphorus reabsorption lead significant change fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) , PTH , vitamin D metabolism ultimately increase fracture risk . Aim : The primary endpoint determine effect canagliflozin bone health evaluate change area curve ( AUC ) FGF23 first 24-72 hour . Secondary endpoint include evaluation canagliflozin biochemical parameter early phase ( 1 week ) drug administration hypothesize new steady state reach related bone metabolism include PTH , 1,25 vitamin D , tubular reabsorption phosphate ( TRP ) , carboxy-terminal telopeptide ( CTX ) . Methods : A randomized , blind , placebo-controlled cross-over pilot study healthy volunteer age 18 year old BMI 20 30 kg/m ( 2 ) . Patients randomized canagliflozin ( 300mg daily ) placebo 5 day study inpatient ( NIH Clinical Center metabolic unit ) . Serial blood urine test 4 hour daily drug administration 12 , 16 24 hour thereafter use assess change pre-specified endpoint . Each subject provide diet contain fixed content phosphate , sodium , calcium throughout study , begin 7 day prior administration drug ( placebo ) . Study Objectives : The primary objective study determine AUC change FGF23 within 24-72 hour cause SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin . We also examine effect canagliflozin various biochemical marker bone metabolism ( include phosphorus , PTH , various hydroxylated vitamin D derivative , calcium , marker bone turnover ) first 5 day drug administration . Background Rationale : Standards Care Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 ( T2DM ) The epidemic T2DM encompass spectrum pathophysiological derangement require focused individualize therapeutic approach . When consider medication choice , American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) guideline suggest inclusion duration disease , age , body weight , life expectancy , expense variation microvascular macrovascular complication . Therapy usually initiate metformin well know decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis effectively low hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) . This drug usually choose first line well tolerate , comparable efficacy , attractive generic price low rate toxicity . Over time , progressive deterioration beta cell function insulin resistance usually require add-on therapy . Options sulfonlyureas , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) inhibitor thiazoladinediones ( TZDs ) . However , Bennett et al recently evaluate meta-analysis , therapy similar effectiveness reduction HbA1c 1 percent , class different side effect . TZDs , example , offer comparative improvement hyperglycemia , side effect agent . Additionally , evidence serious adverse event emerge year class drug market , thus delay appropriate recognition . Liver toxicity first serious side effect discover lead withdrawal troglitazone , restriction temporarily place rosiglitazone concern relate increase myocardial infarction risk . TZDs also show increase incidence chronic heart failure ( CHF ) select patient 8 , bone fracture especially woman , bladder cancer especially receive therapy 5 year longer . Risk assessment important patient consider initiation new drug . In particular , vulnerable population high risk , include old T2DM patient multiple co-morbidities often suffer high rate adverse medication effect . Likewise , patient diagnose T2DM young age likely receive drug long duration , heightens concern long term drug toxicity . Therefore , critical selection antidiabetic medication account short term long term consequence . Rationale SGLT-2 inhibitor Novel Drugs Treatment T2DM Hyperglycemia complex disease state describe interplay among ominous octet 18 pancreas , liver , small intestine , skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , brain kidney contribute glucose metabolism . Pharmacotherapy development effectively seek target mechanism via various pathway . The renal reabsorption glucose recently become focus therapeutic intervention introduction sodium glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitor 2013 . SGLT2 locate S1 segment proximal renal tubule high-capacity , low-affinity transporter mediate majority glucose reabsorption . Glucose escape SGLT2 reabsorb SGLT1 , low-capacity , high-affinity transporter locate S3 segment proximal renal tubule . Under condition SGLT2 inactivate either mutation inhibitor , urinary glucose excretion range 20-200 g/day . The evidence SGLT2 major pathway renal glucose reabsorption come genetic study individual familial renal glucosuria ( FRG ) , autosomal recessive disorder SLGT2 . It almost century since first case describe cause glucosuria set normal blood glucose concentration absence sign renal tubular dysfunction . Different phenotypes describe base extent glucosuria . Individual kindred study help identify least 44 different mutation SLC5A2 gene . Long term follow individual demonstrate major health problem . However , give inconsistency follow small number report case , difficult infer true extent complication . Another genetic defect renal glucose transport know due mutation GLUT2 transporter , responsible Fanconi-Bickel syndrome ( FBS ) . This rare autosomal recessive disorder cause homozygous compound heterozygous mutation GLUT2 ( SLC2A2 ) gene . It characterize hepatorenal glycogen accumulation , proximal renal tubular dysfunction ( Fanconi nephropathy ) , hypophosphatemic vitamin D dependent rickets severe growth retardation . The relation glucose transport phosphate metabolism well understood . Mannstadt et al evaluate two family vary degree hypophosphatemic rickets urinary phosphate wasting find novel mutation GLUT2 causative factor calcium phosphate imbalance , think due change phosphate transporter Npt2c . To support hypothesis , study tgGlut2-/- mouse also demonstrate decrease Npt2c expression proximal renal tubule . While interplay genetic disease hypophosphatemic rickets still elucidate , change glucose homeostasis show profound effect bone health mineral metabolism . Pharmacological support development SGLT2 inhibitor come study use phlorizin , natural product discover 1835 root bark apple tree . Von Mering discover ingestion phlorizin produce glucosuria human . Rossetti DeFronzo et al find partially pancreatectomized rat , phlorizin normalize blood glucose level . While theoretical concept support idea glucosuria could normalize fast feed plasma glucose level ( reverse insulin resistance animal ) , immediately translate pharmacotherapy due phlorizin multiple limitation : ( 1 ) low selectivity SGLT2 SGLT1 cause frequent gastrointestinal side effect , ( 2 ) degradation gut enzyme disaccharidase reduce oral bioavailability , ( 3 ) interaction one metabolites , phloretin , inhibit GLUT2 GLUT1 glucose reabsorption gut . Canagliflozin first SGLT2 inhibitor approve FDA , approval take place January , 2013 . However , data dapagliflozin present FDA review early July , 2011 , approval delay January 2014 , mostly concern increase risk bladder breast cancer . The SGLT2 inhibitor study protocol , decrease renal threshold glucose excretion ( occur average &gt; 70-90mg/dL presence canagliflozin ) increase glucosuria approximately 80-100 grams/day , thereby reduce plasma glucose . At high FDA approve dose canagliflozin ( 300mg/day ) give monotherapy , HbA1c improve 1.2 % . In addition , canagliflozin therapy lead several pharmacological effect : evidence 2-3 % weight loss , decrease systolic blood pressure 4.5mmHg baseline , increase insulin sensitivity contribute beneficial clinical profile patient T2DM . SGLT2 Inhibitor Changes Bone Health : A Summary Data The first indication SGLT2 inhibitor could possibly influence bone health come animal study 38 . Rats expose high dos dapagliflozin ( first develop drug class ) observe disturbance calcium homeostasis , tissue mineralization , increase trabecular bone renal medullary tubular degeneration . The propose mechanism think due high dose dapagliflozin cause non-selective inhibition SGLT1 gut , thereby alter pH balance intestinal lumen increase calcium reabsorption . These finding think relevant human pharmacology SGLT2 inhibitor administer approved dos . Nevertheless , give finding , special attention pay bone mineralization change clinical development . Specifically , data present FDA advisory committee meeting dapagliflozin July 2011 demonstrate increase fracture rate 104 week dedicate study patient moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 30-59mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ) 9.4 % fracture 10 mg dose 6 % fracture 5 mg dose , versus zero fracture placebo . In patient normal renal function , also note 2-fold increase fracture . However , sponsor argue imbalance non-significant associate small laboratory change , possible influence weight loss fracture rate , minimal effect bone mineral density ( BMD ) inconsistencies various short term long term study . Ultimately , drug approve safety relate reason , study dedicate bone health recommend . Later , Ljuggren et al report significant change bone marker change DEXA 50 week , mean increase phosphate observe trend towards increase CTX procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) also evident . Canagliflozin , second drug review FDA January 2013 , also underwent dedicate analysis bone safety due concern finding animal study similar dapagliflozin . Specific parameter evaluate included calcium , phosphorus , bone turnover marker fracture rate . A phase II study find 23-37 % rise bone resorption marker CTX week 3 persist week 12 . Likewise , increase PTH observe week 3 , return toward baseline week 6-12 . At high dos , study also demonstrate slight decrease 25-hydroxyvitamin D well 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D. In pooled analysis placebo control study ( n=2,313 ) 26 week , 5.1 % mean change serum phosphate observe among high dose 300mg compare placebo . In another 26-week analysis ( n= 269 ) renal impairment patient ( eGFR great equal 30 &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73 ( 2 ) ) , serum phosphate increase 7.8 % baseline 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D decrease 8.1 % baseline 44 . Interestingly , acute change serum phosphate ( 0.5 mg/dL mean change baseline ) report within three week study initiation . A dedicated bone study old adult age 55-80 ( n=715 ) , high dose 300mg canagliflozin increase serum CTX baseline 24.9 % 26 week 22 % 52 week , P1NP decrease 6.9 % high dose group 26 week . Also high dose group , DEXA scan find decrease 0.7 % mean percent change lumbar spine total hip , quantative-CT demonstrate decrease 1.9 % 1.6 % lumbar spine total hip , respectively . In term fracture , prospectively adjudicate analysis across phase III study demonstrate 0.6 % difference fracture rate canagliflozin non-canagliflozin group . Analysis fracture location trauma classification demonstrate imbalance upper limb fracture favor canagliflozin . This imbalance persist low trauma upper limb fracture spine ( Figure 1 ) . In pooled analysis treatment arm , females high incidence upper limb fracture ( 1.2 % [ 31/2608 ] ) compare placebo ( 0.4 % [ 5/1338 ] ) . The location distal extremity , include hand , distal forearm wrist similar wide variety fracture sit find disease primary hyperparathyroidism .</detailed_description>
