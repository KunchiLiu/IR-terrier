	<brief_summary>There high prevalence iron deficiency patient undergo bariatric surgery effective therapy lack . Thus , critical need effective , non-invasive , inexpensive form iron supplementation treat iron deficiency improve tolerance , associate cognitive symptom , quality life bariatric surgery patient population . Often , patient participate bariatric program , compliant , and/or lose follow-up . If effective evidence-based guideline repletion iron deficiency , patient likely compliant . Therefore , randomize control study , investigator propose test effectiveness HIP versus ferrous sulfate oral iron supplementation iron deficient patient RYGB SG bariatric surgery . By randomize patient two group , investigator able determine effective regimen improve blood biomarkers iron status , cognitive function , quality life . Other outcome include adverse effect compliance supplementation . The investigator also analyze three-day food record determine contribution dietary factor change iron status . To test improvement iron status , serial blood draw perform time period ~10 week . Serial blood draw iron deficient patient routinely perform past study find harmful . Because relatively short study ( 10 week ) , subject able recover quickly blood loss study . investigator expect find iron supplementation HIP effective ferrous sulfate repletion iron deficiency . This project address significant health issue individual bariatric surgery , grow population United States . It estimate almost 1.5 million individual undergone bariatric surgery since year 1990 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To determine effective oral iron supplementation regimen repletion iron deficiency patient gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy . In iron deficient patient , two supplement regimen compare : 1 . Ferrous sulfate 65 mg t.i.d . ( standard care / control ) , elemental iron 2 . Proferrin ES 12 mg t.i.d. , heme-iron polypeptide . Primary outcome reference index iron status : - Ferritin , TIBC , sTfR , sTfR : ferritin ratio - Secondary outcome : - measure anemia , determine blood hemoglobin concentration - measure cognitive function via several computerized test work memory , sustain attention , spatial memory - fatigue Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory questionnaire - Quality life SF-36 Survey Safety outcome : â€¢ adverse event , compliance , measure iron toxicity , liver enzymes 2 . In subject undergo iron supplementation describe Aim 1 , determine contribution dietary factor ( include heme non-heme iron intake , intake enhancer inhibitor iron absorption ) change iron status .</detailed_description>
