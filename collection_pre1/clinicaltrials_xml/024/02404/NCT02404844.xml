	<detailed_description>This clinical trial molecularly stratify parallel cohort , single arm design explore efficacy safety BKM120 combination tamoxifen patient ER/PR-positive , HER2-negative breast cancer prior exposure antihormonal therapy , different biomarker profile , two potentially indicative constitutive PI3K pathway activation : - PIK3CA mutation/preserved PTEN expression - PIK3CA wildtype mutation/ loss PTEN expression - PIK3CA wildtype/preserved PTEN expression . This trial explore , combination BKM120 tamoxifen overcome resistance antihormonal therapy . BKM120 selective class I PI3K enzymes mTOR inhibitory activity enter Phase II III clinical trial . The tumor suppressor PTEN important negative regulator PI3K signal pathway . Therefore , addition trial prospectively evaluate PIK3CA mutation and/or loss PTEN expression predictive biomarkers clinical benefit combine treatment BKM120 tamoxifen .</detailed_description>
