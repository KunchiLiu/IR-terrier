	<brief_summary>This phase II , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , international ( Spain Sweden ) multicentre study . In set postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer , treatment aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) effective well-studied therapy . Vaginal dryness one frequently report symptom cause adjuvant therapy may lead reduce adherence breast cancer woman . This study explore safety 0.005 % estriol vaginal gel oncological context , demonstrate medicinal product safe option treat vaginal atrophy cause AIs , without clinically relevant influence gonadotropin systemic estrogen level . The main objective evaluate level Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) treatment 0.005 % estriol vaginal gel hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal woman early stage breast cancer treatment Non-Steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors ( NSAIs ) adjuvant set symptom vaginal atrophy .</brief_summary>
