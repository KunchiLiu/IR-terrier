	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The role use 2DUS gynaecology undisputed form integral part diagnose pathology uterus , tubes ovary . In reproductive medicine , particular significance additionally widespread tool available monitor endometrial thickness , follicular status growth , allow guide retrieval oocyte ovary also guide transfer fertilise embryos uterus [ 1 ] . These undoubtedly critical procedures/steps ART . The development 3DUS bring somewhat breakthrough field 3D volume image acquire analysed live retrospectively . From practical perspective , scan procedure differ routine 2D US acquisition 3D volume require second . Analysis volume allow reconstruction plane always possible 2DUS ( 3D coronal plane uterus ) . As result , 3DUS consider accurate non-invasive modality diagnose uterine anomaly [ 2 , 3 ] . Furthermore , 3DUS allows accurate volume calculation structure endometrium follicle . These new possibility , couple advance software also allow automated measurement variable , may improve accuracy , reduce interobserver variability increase efficiency ART unit [ 4 ] . Several publication literature support 3DUS may play major role ART future [ 5-8 ] . Areas 3D US may provide additional information : - Assessment ovarian blood flow , follicular volume growth [ 9 ] - Assessment endometrial subendometrial blood flow volume [ 10 , 11 ] - Assessment precise catheter placement embryo transfer [ 12 ] The latter perhaps area least investigated far , despite embryo transfer arguably step high importance throughout entire ART process . Two preliminary study show 3DUS guided embryo transfer significantly improve catheter placement compare 2DUS [ 13 ] allow correction 20 % mal-positioned catheter 2DUS alone use [ 14 ] . The large series date , demonstrate use 3DUS , placement embryo perform call maximum implantation potential point , trajectory fallopian tubes meet centre uterine cavity , endometrial thickness blood flow think great [ 12 ] . However , knowledge , randomise control trial ( RCT ) literature systematically test 3DUS versus 2DUS guide embryo transfer respect pregnancy outcomes . If 3DUS guide embryo transfer confirm produce high pregnancy rate 2DUS guide embryo transfer , significant impact daily clinical practice ART unit worldwide . AIMS AND HYPOTHESES Aims To determine 3DUS guided embryo transfer routinely replace 2DUS guided embryo transfer . Hypotheses 3DUS guided embryo transfer produce high clinical pregnancy rate compare 2DUS guided embryo transfer PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Subject recruitment Women infertility recruit Assisted Reproductive Technology Unit department Obstetrics Gynaecological , Prince Wales Hospital . They give information leaflet begin treatment cycle , counsel day oocyte retrieval day commencement progesterone therapy . This allow sufficient time consider participation trial confirm consent day embryo transfer . The investigator anticipate 80 % subject undergoing embryo transfer participate . Study design A prospective single-blinded randomize controlled trial . Inclusion criterion : - Women undergo embryo transfer either fresh frozen cycle . - Women whose endometrial cavity visualise adequately via US Exclusion criterion - Women age &gt; 42 year - Women whose endometrial cavity visualise adequately via US , : Large fibroid Adenomyosis BMI &gt; 35 Significant uterine retroflexion/retroversion Power calculation The large publish series date use 3DUS guided embryo transfer demonstrate clinical pregnancy rate 37 % woman average age 38 [ 12 ] . Our unit 2013 achieve clinical pregnancy rate 25 % woman similar age group . Assuming 3DUS guided embryo transfer enable unit increase clinical pregnancy rate 25 % 37 % ( increase 12 % ) , power calculation use alpha 0.05 , beta 0.2 power 0.80 , indicate 232 patient per arm require . To account small amount drop-outs 480 subject total recruit . Methods 232 woman per arm recruit part prospective randomize controlled trial . The inclusion criterion patient reproductive failure undergo IVF/ICSI embryo transfer . The exclusion criterion ( ) woman age &gt; 42 year ; ( ii ) woman whose endometrial cavity visualise adequately via US , large fibroid , adenomyosis ; ( iii ) BMI &gt; 35 , ( iv ) significant uterine retroflexion/retroversion . At time embryo transfer , patient assign either two group : ) 2DUS group embryo transfer guidance 2DUS , b ) 3DUS group , embryo transfer guidance 3DUS . Randomisation Patients randomise 3D 2DUS group 1 1 ratio use computer-generated randomisation list block 10 seal envelope pre-prepared impartial research nurse , ensure equal distribution subject assignment . Procedure The use 2DUS guidance embryo transfer universally standard practice . All ultrasound examination perform use GE Voluson series ultrasound machine , standard 3D transvaginal probe ( model RIC5-9-D ; 6.6 MHz central image frequency ) . The examination 3DUS identical routine 2D examination include acquisition 3D volume take second . The 3D facility engage switch `` 3D '' mode . A mobile sector appear operator identifies `` region interest . '' The acquisition commence transducer crystal rotate approximately 90Â° less 10 second . The image show instantly operator store digitally onto hard disc attach ultrasonography machine subsequent analysis . For purpose homogeneity reduce operator bias , principal applicant ( SS ) perform 3DUS examination . For purpose homogeneity reduce operator bias , principal investigator ( SS ) perform 3DUS examination . In 3D group , catheter position correct accord coronal plane view uterus 3DUS , aim maximum implantation potential point , along midline uterine cavity , previously describe literature [ 12 ] . In 2D group , catheter position guide longitudinal plane 2DUS , accord current clinical practice . The patient blind technique use embryo transfer , show 2D/3D image embryo flash transfer complete catheter remove . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure clinical pregnancy rate , define presence least one gestational sac 6 week gestation . The secondary outcome measure include implantation rate , multiple pregnancy , miscarriage , ectopic pregnancy , live birth rate . Miscarriage define biochemical US evidence pregnancy clinical US evidence pregnancy . Live birth consider baby born live 24 week gestation . Data processing analysis The researcher ensure confidentiality sensitive data minimize number personnel handle subject data . The computer data encrypt required maximize security . All paper document lock file cabinet , authorize personnel could access information . Data processing statistical analysis perform use Statistical Packages Social Sciences Windows ( SPSS , Inc ) . Data present percentage , mean standard deviation , median range appropriate . Comparisons group carry Student T test continuous variable , ANOVA mean value comparison , Chi-square/Fisher 's exact test categorical data . Stepwise logistic regression analysis may perform part systematic analysis primary outcome . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Monitoring interim analysis As study perceive safe pose additional hazard , Data Monitoring Committee interim analysis consider necessary , accordance current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommendation [ 15 ] . Ethical consideration US safe non-invasive examination . There known adverse effect routine ultrasound mother embryo . No extra pain discomfort associate 3DUS versus 2DUS time difference perform exam minimal . Application ethic approval already submit December 2014 pending final approval . Consent All subject give detailed write explanation study sufficient time consider participation . A write consent form sign patient retain confidential record .</detailed_description>
