	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Proof Concept Study Daratumumab Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma , Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma , Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label ( everyone know study intervention ) , Phase 2 study evaluate efficacy safety daratumumab relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , follicular lymphoma . The study three phase . Screening phase , treatment phase , follow-up phase . Participants receive daratumumab ( 16 milligram per kilogram [ mg/kg ] ) intravenous infusion approximately 3.5 year . Participants primarily assess overall response rate . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

Expression CD38 measure immunohistochemistry fresh archive tumor sample central assessment use CD38 investigational IHC assay development : ) Stage 1 : participant whose tumor equal ( &gt; = ) 50 percent ( % ) positive CD38 , b ) Stage 2 : participant le ( &lt; ) 50 % CD38+ great ( &gt; ) 50 % CD38+ depend distribution CD 38 expression enrol participant Stage 2 . The sponsor advise eligibility criterion permit enrollment period Participant must ECOG performance status score 0 1 Women childbearing potential must practice highly effective method birth control consistent local regulation regard use birth control method participant participate clinical study : example , establish use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; barrier method : condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ; male partner sterilization ( vasectomized partner sole partner participant ) ; true abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle participant ) study ( 3 month last dose component treatment regimen ) A woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day commence treatment . Females reproductive potential must commit either abstain continuously heterosexual sexual intercourse use 2 method reliable birth control simultaneously A man sexually active woman childbearing potential vasectomy must agree use barrier method birth control example , either condom spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository partner occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository , men must also donate sperm study 3 month receive last dose component treatment regimen . The exception restriction participant 's female partner surgically sterile , second method birth control require Known central nervous system lymphoma Prior antitumor therapy include ( time measure prior start study drug ) : nitrosoureas within 6 week , chemotherapy within 3 week , therapeutic antibody within 4 week , radio toxinimmunoconjugates within 10 week , radiation therapy within 2 week , investigational agent within 3 week , unless antibody within 4 week Daratumumab antiCD38 therapy Participant history malignancy ( NHL ) within 3 year screen period ( exception squamous basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix , nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer ( papillary neoplasms low malignant potential primary noninvasive tumor ) , malignancy opinion investigator , concurrence sponsor 's medical monitor , consider cure minimal risk recurrence within 2 year ) Participant know chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) less ( &lt; ) 50 % predict normal .
