	<brief_summary>Rhinosinusitis one prevalent diseases within United States lead decrease quality life patient suffer condition . A foundation treatment rhinosinusitis nasal saline irrigation , administer irrigation bottle . The irrigation bottle prone contamination bacterial fungal specie despite proper maintenance . A new commercially available irrigation solution create use chitosan , natural polysaccharide antibacterial antifungal property . This research project examine ability chitosan decrease prevent contamination irrigation bottle 1 month use adult patient rhinosinusitis . Participants project use either saline chitosan irrigation solution 1 month switch solution 1 month . Following 1 month use , irrigation bottle culture determine chitosan irrigation solution decrease contamination irrigation bottle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rhinosinusitis one prevalent diseases United States estimate 31 million adult diagnosed condition . The annual health care burden estimate exceed 5.8 billion dollar . Unfortunately , underlie etiology rhinosinusitis fully understood may encompass multiple factor include : anatomic variation , impair immune function , ciliary dysfunction , seasonal allergy , aspirin allergy , bacterial biofilms . There wide variety treatment option aim reduce symptom rhinosinusitis nasal saline irrigation ( NSI ) one foundation therapeutic intervention . The benefit NSI rhinosinusitis reduce nasal symptom demonstrate multiple report . The mechanisms NSI exert beneficial effect fully understood , though multiple theory exist include : improvement mucociliary function , decrease nasal mucosal edema , removal infectious debris allergen . NSI administer intranasally use irrigation bottle wide variety brand commercially available patient select . In Department Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery Clinic University Virginia Health System , NeiMed bottle provide patient diagnosed rhinosinusitis . In addition , patient give informational sheet regard care clean irrigation bottle . Unfortunately , irrigation bottle become colonized bacteria include : Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumonia , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Candida specie . The contamination irrigation bottle nidus continue bacterial introduction nasal cavity therefore decrease beneficial effect NSI . Recently , novel commercially available irrigation solution , ChitoRhino , develop chitosan , natural polysaccharide demonstrate antibacterial antifungal property . This polysaccharide beneficial property multiple clinic application include wound heal post-operative sinus surgery . Chitosan 's antimicrobial function develop polycationic structure . Chitosan interact negatively charge bacterial wall , lead disruption cell lysis . There paucity literature examine beneficial effect chitosan decrease bacterial contamination irrigation bottle . This project represent pilot study investigate antimicrobial effect chitosan irrigation bottle patient rhinosinusitis .</detailed_description>
