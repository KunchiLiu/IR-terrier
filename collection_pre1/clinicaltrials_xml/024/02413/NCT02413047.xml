	<detailed_description>The immunogenicity anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( anti-TNF ) therapy inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) important cause loss response therapy may lead escalation dose discontinuation therapy . Antibodies may develop infliximab ( ATI ) adalimumab ( ATA ) cause loss response , also know secondary loss response . In attempt overcome antibody , dose escalation accomplish either increase dose shorten interval dos . The ability dose escalation overcome loss response due presence ATI ATA remain controversial . Escalation dose increase cost therapy substantially . If decision make discontinue therapy secondary loss response , clinician may choose switch alternate anti-TNF therapy currently four . Loss response one agent predict less response anti-TNF agent limited number therapeutic option goal optimize therapy rather discontinue therapy . An alternative approach addition immunomodulator ( IM ) therapy counteract antibody response regain efficacy biologic medication . Three IMs know effective treatment IBD azathioprine ( AZA ) , 6-mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) methotrexate ( MTX ) . The SONIC trial show patient infliximab azathioprine develop antibody 4 % time oppose infliximab monotherapy form ATI 13 % . The principal show COMMIT trial patient infliximab alone ATI rate 20 % versus 4 % methotrexate plus infliximab . Ben-Horin et al . report five patient treat initially infliximab monotherapy secondary loss response base clinical symptom . These patient ATI undetectable trough infliximab . In five patient ATI become undetectable , adequate trough level restore patient regain clinical response addition immunomodulator . Combination therapy azathioprine infliximab lead high percentage patient steroid free remission either drug alone . Our goal treat patient ' lose response adalimumab infliximab immunomodulator goal eliminate circulate antibody anti-TNF restore efficacy .</detailed_description>
