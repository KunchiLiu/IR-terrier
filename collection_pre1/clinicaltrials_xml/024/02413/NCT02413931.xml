	<brief_summary>Single-center , observational , prospective cohort study include patient hospitalize multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ward Marius Nasta Institute . The increase rate multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) tuberculosis ( TB ) cause great concern . The current study conduct Marius Nasta Institute , one two nationwide excellence treatment center MDR-TB Romania , aim prospectively investigate population structure patient MDR-TB admit treatment M. tuberculosis strain isolated patient . Transmission MDR- strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis among patient hospitalize also ascertain . Additionally biomarkers treatment response course tuberculosis therapy evaluate .

	<detailed_description>Single-center , observational , prospective cohort study include patient hospitalize MDR-TB ward Marius Nasta Institute . An estimated 100 patient MDR-TB consecutively admit treatment MNI assess eligibility study participant . All potential participant ask provide information demographic , epidemiological clinical characteristic well prior treatment disease history . Microbiological data , treatment adverse event data also record . The data expect supplement exist body knowledge patient MDR-TB region . In order characterize M. tuberculosis strain , sputum sample collect participant upon admission MDR-TB ward 3 month therapy . Additionally , subsequent sample identify positive prior culture conversion also undergo test . Key examination sample include drug susceptibility test solid medium molecular typing . If sample originate patient show discordance , whole genome sequencing perform allow strain comparison actual patient strain isolated patient identify potential nosocomial transmission . The location ward patient well activity also record scope identify possible route transmission . Blood urine sample collect specific time point study assessed order identify candidate biomarkers potentially correlate response anti-tuberculosis therapy . All data generate study collect standardized study form enter password-secured database .</detailed_description>
