	<brief_summary>**PLEASE NOTE** study currently open client wait list Centre Trauma Resilience Growth , UK . The project involve adapt implement five minute daily self-practice compassion-focused intervention evaluate impact psychological physiological factor associate trauma . It aim offer novel intervention may facilitate benefit trauma specific therapy . This would unique use self-practice Compassion Focused Therapy ( CFT ) specifically trauma client . Previous research find many factor impact client 's benefitting therapy , include depression , anxiety self-criticism . These thing also get way compassionate towards oneself , difficulty people experience traumatic event . Service user identify additional support trauma specific therapy useful may offer positive use time whilst therapy wait list . Hypotheses : . A brief CFT intervention decrease level depression , anxiety , stress increase baseline Heart Rate Variability . ii . The compassion focus intervention increase experience self-compassion , social safeness , reduce level self-criticism . iii . High 'fear compassion ' moderate impact intervention result small change depression , anxiety , stress post traumatic change . Clients Centre trauma , resilience growth approach participate study . All participant experience trauma seek psychological support . The current compassion focus intervention offer participant wait list trauma specific therapy trauma centre . Each participant ask practice intervention time period three week . There initial assessment , repeat assessment follow intervention , repeat assessment pre post trauma specific therapy engage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project implement five-minute daily self-practice CFT intervention evaluate impact psychological physiological factor associate trauma . It aim offer novel intervention may facilitate benefit trauma-specific therapy . Follow-up data may demonstrate maintenance positive effect increase positive effect self-practice continued . This would unique use self-practice CFT specifically trauma client . Study Design The study use delay intervention Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) use block design.A delay intervention group act passive control group . Participants engage daily five-minute self-practice CFT intervention prior engage trauma-specific TAU . The CFT intervention adapt specifically trauma client base literature review , involvement service user , close collaboration Professor Paul Gilbert . The project involve three stage , outline . Stage One : Development CFT intervention feasibility test Development The final version adapt five-minute CFT practice include consultation Paul Gilbert original author five-minute CFT intervention ( unpublished ) well consultation research supervisor . It available audio write format . Permission kindly give Paul Gilbert adapt use project . The current version CFT intervention include : instruction , explanation compassion aim intervention . It include several exercise design increase self-compassion include breathing exercise compassionate imagery exercise focus self others . Throughout adaptation process , service user ' idea consider . The intervention include explicit instruction focus traumatic event participant experience . This address trauma-specific therapy . Participants encourage focus milder difficulty stressor . The adaptation account current literature CFT maintain basic principle , focus build self-compassion reduce self-criticism . Participant sample feasibility test opportunistic , seek voluntary engagement client currently access service . The sample size stage explicitly define depend number interested party . This aim test feasibility acceptability intervention instruction clinical population . Participants ask practice intervention two-week period . Stage Two : Randomised control trial Design The research utilise single-blind blocked-randomisation design , incorporate three-week intervention versus waiting-list block . Following end initial block , participant form passive , waiting-list group engage active intervention , whilst active group continue remain waiting list . Both routine project-specific outcome measure implement . Therapists recruitment site conduct screen assessment post TAU assessment . All measurement complete primary researcher . Prospective participant provide information sheet part screen interview , consent , contact researcher . They give opportunity ask question ask sign consent form wish participate . It make clear non-participation adverse effect access psychological treatment engage project affect access treatment . An initial appointment make pre-intervention assessment complete . Participants allocate CFT waiting-list condition use blocked randomisation . Self-report measure upload academically-focused online survey tool ( eSurv ) participant Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) measurements take face-to-face appointment primary researcher . The five-minute CFT self-practice intervention available write audio ( CD mp3 ) format . Participants receive daily email text reminder practice intervention deem appropriate . Participants give choice complete daily monitor sheet daily online access monitor record level CFT practice . Participants ask practice intervention daily basis three week repeat completion online assessment HRV measurement week follow block . An priori power calculation obtain use G*Power 3.1.9 software ( Faul , Erdfelder , Buchner &amp; Lang , 2009 ) . With Depression , Anxiety Stress Scale ( DASS-21 : Lovibond &amp; Lovibond , 1995 ) primary outcome measure , average effect size brief CFT intervention DASS equivalent large effect size f .74 ( McEwan &amp; Gilbert , 2013 ) . An average estimate test-retest reliability 0.77 ( Brown , Chorpita , Korotitsch &amp; Barlow , 1997 ) . Given number group ( 2 ) repetition ( 4 ) plan study assume test-retest reliability .77 , sample size least 16 ( 8 per group ) require provide sufficient power ( 80 % ) detect effect similar magnitude ( f = .74 ) alpha level .05 . Average attrition rate client PTSD approximately 20 % , although rate vary 48 % ( Imel , Laska , Jakupcak &amp; Simpson , 2013 ) . A cautious 60 % ( approx . ) attrition rate consider give research additional participant ' involvement CTRG . Further allow room moderate effect size , give intervention previously trialled clinical sample , target sample 40 participant seek . Given 150 referral receive CTRG last year feasible . Withdrawal Participants assign code number assessment data store password-protected computer file . This accessible researcher transfer data do use encrypted memory stick . Any personal data use contact participant delete upon completion experimental aspect project . Participants withdraw time inform data collect past first week intervention process erase may still use project analyse . Consent form sign store locked filing cabinet researcher 's home office transfer University Lincoln 's archived storage follow project completion . Data store seven year line University 's data storage policy . Implications Dissemination This research project contribute theoretical literature CFT PTSD . It anticipate offer new finding regard self-practice intervention PTSD may beneficial psychological physiological implication impact TAU outcome . The project prepare publication appropriate peer-reviewed journal present relevant conference . It may also disseminate Compassion Mind Foundation Website . In event participant find intervention difficult experience distress , able discus identify person deem appropriate , withdrawn project . Research suggest continued practice may reduce fear compassion ( Rockliff , et al . 2008 ) information share participant . It felt risk adverse event minimal .</detailed_description>
