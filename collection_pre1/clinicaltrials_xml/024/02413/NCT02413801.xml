	<brief_summary>The event underlie conversion Psoriasis Psoriatic Arthritis ( PsA ) well understood . This conversion occur 30 % time within first 10 year psoriasis diagnosis . PsA patient 50 % chance develop joint damage within first 2 year disease . A biomarker identify subclinical joint inflammation psoriasis patient would allow diagnostic tool allow early intervention psoriasis patient provide good understand underlying molecular pathogenesis may lead development new therapeutic target PsA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our long-term goal : 1 ) develop arthritis biomarkers psoriasis patient facilitate early treatment intervention ; , 2 ) identify new therapeutic target PsA well understand underlie molecular pathogenesis . PsA , inflammatory arthritis associate psoriasis , affect approximately 650,000 adult United States associate increased morbidity mortality . Joint inflammation damage arise within first 2 year disease 50 % patient manifest bone erosion joint space narrow plain x-ray . The advent Tumor Necrosis Factor antagonist ( TNFi ) treatment PsA dramatically improve clinical response slow bone cartilage degradation . Nevertheless , 45 % patient meet primary endpoint clinical trial , underscore need new therapeutic option . Another approach improve treatment response early PsA diagnosis , recent data indicate treatment soon disease onset improve outcome . Relevant potential early intervention prevention , psoriatic skin plaque typically precede PsA 10 year . Moreover , significant percentage psoriasis patient subclinical musculoskeletal imaging finding . These finding provide unparalleled opportunity early intervention could potentially limit halt joint inflammation damage . Regrettably , despite obvious advantage early diagnosis treatment , goal remain elusive clinical significance image abnormality psoriasis remain unknown . Furthermore , investigator limit understanding mechanism underlie transition psoriasis PsA , investigator lack disease specific biomarkers necessary identify psoriasis patient new onset arthritis sub-clinical disease . Lastly , third psoriasis patient moderate severe skin disease report undertreated many topical agent unlikely significant effect subclinical clinically apparent joint inflammation . Up 150 subject consent study cross-sectional study - 125 subject Psoriasis ( Ps ) 25 Healthy control . Power Doppler Ultrasound ( PDUS ) joint entheses analyzed find least 35 subject positive US finding define synovitis , effusion , joint erosion , increase vascularity otherwise know signal . Up 50 Ps patient positive PDUS result follow prospectively contact interval update medication history indefinitely . Ps patient ask follow PDUS 4 month post start biologic , DMARD therapy phototherapy patient decides go therapy study longitudinally . Up 30 bone marrow aspiration healthy PDUS positive Psoriasis subject perform . A bone marrow aspiration post start biologic DMARD standard care therapy assess well . Research assay : serum use measure biomarker 14-3-3Î· level , may analyze external company . Peripheral blood use measure frequency DC-STAMP+ cell ( CD14+DC-STAMP+ CD4+DCSTAMP+DC-STAMP+IL-17+ ) . Using multichromatic flow cytometry , measure DC-STAMP expression peripheral blood cell bone marrow cell . To determine elevated BM DC-STAMP expression stromal cell , T cell and/or monocyte promotes OC formation , co-cultures bone marrow stromal hematopoietic cell peripheral blood cell analyze OCPs .</detailed_description>
