	<brief_title>Exercise Training Following Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Literature Review Generally CHF patient reduce exercise capacity , main symptom effort intolerance , early fatigue breathlessness.They also exhibit increase peripheral central chemosensitivity , impaired sympathovagal balance sympathetic activity ( SA ) predominance , depress baroreflex n control . Compared myocardium healthy control , myocardium patient chronic LV dysfunction characterize significant reduction pre-synaptic norepinephrine ( NE ) uptake post-synaptic beta adrenoceptor density.There generalize increase SA heart patient CHF might contribute remodel process LV . This concept consistent find down-regulation myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density , measure use positron emission tomography 11C-CGP-12177 , soon acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) predictive occurrence LV dilatation follow-up . Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density appear reduced patient HF due dilate cardiomyopathy down-regulation myocardial beta-adrenoceptor pronounce patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy proceed LV dilation HF . Therefore , myocardial beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation may general nonspecific response stress could due locally increased amount NE synaptic cleft . The sustained hyperactivity SA observe HF consequence several mechanism include increased central sympathetic outflow , alter neuronal NE reuptake , facilitation cardiovascular response sympathetic stimulation angiotensin II . CRT accept treatment patient moderate-to-severe CHF intraventricular conduction delay . Intraventricular conduction delay , identify QRS interval 120 msec 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , occur third patient severe systolic HF associate dyssynchronous contraction LV , lead impaired emptying , patient , mitral regurgitation . Abnormal atrioventricular coupling ( identify prolong PR interval ) interventricular dyssynchrony , identify echocardiogram , may also occur . CRT atrialsynchronized biventricular pacing often improve cardiac performance immediately , increase stroke volume ( SV ) reduce mitral regurgitation . Randomized trial involve patient severe HF show CRT result reduction symptom improve FC , reduction number hospitalization worsen HF , increase survival . ExT CHF produce meaningful improvement peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) expect average improvement 17 % . This particularly important since improvement FC relate improvement neurohormonal activation , peripheral abnormality ventilatory function . Submaximal exercise capacity ( SubMaxExC ) also improve , assess significant increase ventilatory anaerobic threshold ( VAT ) 6-MWT . The improvement SubMaxExC CHF patient ( NYHA II-III ) probably due peripheral training adaptation skeletal muscle mass ( SMM ) . Theoretically , improve SMM strength , low % maximal contraction would use similar amount work follow training . A low relative muscle contraction would expect produce less blood lactate , thereby decrease need carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) elimination , thus increase VAT . The improvement VAT important would allow patient exercise longer hard without negative alteration ventricular dynamic associate VAT could possibly delay onset ischemic threshold . To severe CHF patient , truly mean improvement SubMaxExC effect ExT relate QOL since engagement daily activity demand VO2peak . All previous study do low moderate risk patient high risk patient probably great need order lead normal , independent life . Results previous study CHF show ExT reduces NE level rest exercise , decrease central sympathetic nerve outflow measure microneurography . ExT also enhance vagal control shift away sympathetic activity , improve heart rate ( HR ) variability HR recovery return well sympathetic-vagal balance . Moreover , ExT produce significant reduction local expression cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -6 inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) SMM CHF patient beneficial effect peripheral inflammatory marker reflect monocyte/macrophage-endothelial cell interaction . These local anti inflammatory effect ExT may attenuate catabolic waste process associate progression CHF . This important issue since inflammatory response play pathogenic role development progression CHF . Probably impaired availability nitric oxide ( NO ) responsible impaired endothelium dependent relaxation peripheral resistance conduit artery may contribute reduce FC CHF severe symptom . Also endothelium-independent vasodilatation abnormality may relate combination impaired smooth muscle responsiveness NO , impair NO diffusion smooth muscle structural alteration arterial compliance associate CHF . The combination ExT CRT well-investigated . One small-scale pilot study ( randomize ) suggest functional capacity improve . More recently , Patwala et al . report improvement quality life ( QOL ) VO2peak improve SMM performance addition 3-month ExT 3-month CRT . In study , patient class III NYHA ExT 3 month duration . Little known ExT elderly severe CHF patient . Plan Methods The purpose research project determine effect add ExT CRT clinical status , ANS function , ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy patient moderate severe CHF . The investigator evaluate follow specific aim : 1- To determine effect long-term ExT program follow CRT provide clinical outcome ; 2-Identify mechanism hypothesize improvement clinical status . The primary end point aim 1 clinical status , namely NYHA functional class , all-cause mortality , hospitalization rate , cardiac function maximal SubMax FC . For aim 2 SA , HRV , HRR blood endothelin-1 , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , IL-6 , IL-2 , IL-4 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a , TNF-b , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEFG ) , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , C reactive protein ( CRP ) . As secondary end point investigator analyze neuromuscular function ( NMF ) , body composition ( BC ) QOL . Relevance : Due increase prevalence CHF consequent implication mortality morbidity rate , prognosis HF improve past 20 year , remain serious condition markedly increase risk death early period onset syndrome . In population study , 10 % mortality 30 day . For survive early high-risk period , 5-year mortality 54 % men 40 % woman . In clinical trial CHF therapy , 50 % death due sudden death progressive HF account around 30 % death , latter proportion increase symptomatic severity increases.In population study include patient new-onset HF , progressive HF appear single common cause death ( 52 % ) , sudden death accounting 22 % death within first 6 month diagnosis.ExT show effective CHF patient NYHA II-III , improve autonomic control enhance vagal tone reduce sympathetic activation , improve exercise FC , QOL , SMM , vasodilator capacity , endothelial dysfunction decrease oxidative stress , hospitalization mortality % . No information available severe patient patient need treatment also significantly impact heath care cost . Moreover , scientific research absent effect ExT CRT severe CHF patient information effect therapy ANS . Thus , propose project address number important gap scientific knowledge potentially large clinical benefit . Methods : The investigator use control stratified experimental design , use longitudinal approach 3 assessment time point : baseline , cardiac implant ( CI ) ( M1 ) ; 3 ( M2 ) 6-month ( M3 ) experimental therapy ( ET ) . It continuum recruitment 24 month study protocol patient . The study employ state art method ANS analysis , namely Scintigraphy 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-MIBG ) . The investigator evaluate clinical , physiological QOL outcome . The assessment cardiac sympathetic neuronal activity 123I-MIBG , radio-labelled analogue NE , improve understand mechanisms responsible increased sympathetic activity HF , sympathetic overactivity exert deleterious action . This technique offer huge advantage order understand happen heart , compare commonly use technique Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity . The inclusion M2 assessment allow u update exercise intensity also conduct initial data analysis . Also technique chosen project group assignment ( stratified age etiology randomization ) , provide best opportunity evaluate expect change relate ET since patient different age etiology respond differently ExT . The ExT design do base Wisloff 's result . The AE develop AIT since previous result show good result due clinical status patient long intervention duration employ different ( slow ) exercise prescription progression . We begin short aerobic interval end 2nd month investigator use protocol Wisloff et al . Compared continuous exercise training method , method allow patient HF complete short period exercise high intensity ( stress heart 's ability ) without deleterious effect undue stress fatigue . Another difference ExT program incorporation resistive sensoriomotor exercise ( SME ) . These type exercise improve lack SMM CHF patient produce positive consequence activity daily life QOL , enhance muscle performance muscle involve aerobic mode exercise . This project provide evidence useful powerful treatment reduce high sympathetic activation ( SA ) lead endothelial dysfunction contribute central peripheral impairment patient severe CHF . In CHF patient , SA initially increase compensatory mechanism ; however , chronically elevate stimulation adrenergic system associate sustain process myocardial remodeling . Another consequence endothelial dysfunction manifest impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation peripheral resistance conduit artery , probably due impaired availability NO . Besides expect change CRT hypothesize add ExT protocol use AIT inclusion endurance SME patient maximize clinical physiological outcome . Our project first provide evidence sympathetic parasympathetic ANS action heart , may alter 6 month ET patient severe CHF . The combination select assessment technique allow overview expect adaptation underlie mechanism . To knowledge project first address precise valid method benefit 6- month ExT program CRT ANS moderate-to-severe CHF patient . Linking result NMF , BC , QOF clinical status improvement contribute understand impact ExT overall health status patient . Also , long period ExT program inclusion M2 assessment allow accurate analysis change process . Expected result : This study firstly contribute good understanding implication combine therapy CHF patient . This study provide extensive characterization change ANS central peripheral , great value stabilization regression disease direct impact patient 's daily life . It expect ExT group compare control group improve physiological variable include project observe previous study less severe CHF patient lead improvement clinical status . The investigator also expect ExT group show well improvement clinical outcome health relate QOL lead decrease overall health care cost .</detailed_description>
