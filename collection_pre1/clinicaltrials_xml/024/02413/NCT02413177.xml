	<brief_summary>The overall goal propose study develop test real time neurofeedback ( EEG-RTNF ) tool augment Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) . This study base theoretical model ( 1 ) mind-wandering self-referential processing associate stress , ( 2 ) meditation redirect wander mind toward present-centered awareness , ( 3 ) meditation also decrease activity hub default mode network ( DMN ) involve mind-wandering self-referential processing , thus ( 4 ) meditation lead decreased activity hub lead reduce stress improve health well-being . Milestones include : ( 1 ) test whether EEG-RTNF PCC meditation augments MBSR novice ; ( 2 ) test whether MBSR EEG-RTNF PCC lead real-world outcome reduce stress improve attention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) effective intervention promote positive cognitive behavioral change improve health . However , MBSR delivery may suboptimal . Recent work potential neural mechanism underlie meditation practice core MBSR may utilize improve MBSR delivery efficacy . The investigator show recently posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC ) , brain region implicate anxiety , addiction , Alzheimer 's , ADHD , medical malady , selectively deactivate three meditation practice core MBSR suggest central role PCC neurobiology MBSR . The investigator also recently confirm PCC deactivation corresponds subjective experience meditation meditators . The propose study use EEG-RTNF PCC meditation innovative strategy augment MBSR improve outcomes . The task mindfulness—the principle component MBSR—is maintain attention acceptance toward present-moment experience , redirect attention one 's immediate experience stray . This present-centered awareness may consider counterpoint self-referential processing mind-wandering . Consistent role PCC mind-wandering , PCC specifically deactivate three meditation practice ( mindfulness breath , loving-kindness , choiceless awareness ) experience meditators compare novice ) . Supporting finding , research study . show PCC deactivation meditation correlate behavioral measure attention ( Rapid Visual Information Processing Task , RVIP ) experience meditators , suggest PCC deactivation associate improved attention meditators . Another research study show PCC deactivate experienced meditators mindfully view emotional image suggest PCC deactivation associate emotional stability enhance present-moment awareness . EEG-RTNF emerge technology similar classic biofeedback individual receive moment-to-moment feedback brain activity particular task , typically dynamic visual display ( e.g. , graph ) .</detailed_description>
