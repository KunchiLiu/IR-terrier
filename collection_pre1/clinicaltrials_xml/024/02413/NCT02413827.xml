	<brief_title>A Study Varlilumab ( Anti-CD27 ) Ipilimumab CDX-1401 Patients With Unresectable Stage III IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varlilumab fully human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call CD27 find certain immune cell may act promote anti-tumor effect . Yervoy™ ( Ipilimumab ) human monoclonal antibody block CTLA-4 , protein receptor downregulates immune system . CDX-1401 vaccine make fully human monoclonal antibody link NY-ESO-1 design deliver NY-ESO-1 professional antigen present cell generate robust immune response cancer cell express NY-ESO-1 . CDX-1401 administer poly-ICLC , adjuvant enhances vaccine-induced immune response . This study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy varlilumab ipilimumab , without addition CDX-1401/poly-ICLC , patient melanoma . Eligible patient enroll Phase I portion study assign one two possible dose level varlilumab combination 3 mg/kg ipilimumab . The first phase study test safety profile combination determine dose varlilumab study Phase II study . During Phase II , 48 patient whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 , receive recommend dose varlilumab determine Phase I 3 mg/kg ipilimumab . Up 24 patient whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 receive recommend dose varlilumab combine 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 1 mg CDX-1401 along 2 mg poly-ICLC . All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
