	<brief_summary>Background : It often hypothesize frequency follow-up patient early-stage endometrial cancer could decrease . However , study evaluate effect reduce follow-up schedule among patient group lack . Objective : Assess patient satisfaction cost-effectiveness less frequent follow-up schedule compare schedule accord Dutch guideline . Study design : Dutch multicentre randomize control trial 5 year follow-up . Patients ( n=282 ) randomize intervention group 4 follow-up visit 3 year , control group 10-13 follow-up visit 5 year , accord Dutch guideline . Patients ask fill questionnaire baseline , 6 , 12 , 36 60 month . Patient inclusion take two year ( 60 % patient participate ) . Outcomes : Primary : Patient satisfaction follow-up care cost-effectiveness . Secondary : health care use , adherence schedule , health-related quality life , fear recurrence , anxiety depression , information provision , recurrence , survival Patients : Stage 1A 1B low-risk endometrial cancer patient , adjuvant radiotherapy indicate Statistics : linear regression analyse assess difference patient satisfaction follow-up care intervention control group adjust potential pre-defined confounders . Expected result : Patients intervention arm similar satisfaction follow-up care overall outcome , low health care use cost patient control arm . No effect expect QALY difference ( loss ) satisfaction , reduce schedule expect save 144.000 per year Netherlands .</brief_summary>
