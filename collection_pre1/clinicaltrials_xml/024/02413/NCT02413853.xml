	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy bevacizumab without CBP/beta-catenin antagonist PRI-724 ( PRI-724 ) work treat patient newly diagnose colorectal cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . PRI-724 may help stop growth cancer cell block specific signal pathway cancer cell need grow spread . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy bevacizumab work well without PRI-724 treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab With Without PRI-724 Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression‐free survival patient newly diagnose metastatic colorectal cancer treat modified fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin 6 ( mFOLFOX6 ) /bevacizumab PRI‐724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival , define period time randomization death . II . Response rate . III . Determine incidence severity adverse event PRI‐724 administer 7‐day continuous infusion patient treat mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab PRI‐724 . IV . Determine messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression level gene involve Wnt pathway ( i.e . survivin ) reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction ( RT‐PCR ) patient treat mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab PRI‐724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) tumor biopsy specimen . V. Determine CTC survivin stem cell marker expression consistent congruent expression tumor specimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine correlation exist Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) / B-Raf proto-oncogene , serine/threonine kinase ( BRAF ) mutation status intratumoral gene expression follow Wnt related biomarkers : survivin , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , S100 calcium bind protein A4 ( S100A4 ) , EPH receptor B2 ( EphB2 ) , connexin43 , cyclinD1 patient treat mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab PRI‐724 vs. mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab alone . II . Determine mutational spectrum colon cancer tissue . III . Determine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) profile normal colon cancer tissue . IV . Determine describe tumor heterogeneity colon cancer tissue prior treatment PRI‐724 . V. Determine gene expression signature , micro RNA ( miRNA ) signatures , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation signatures potential predictive prognostic marker . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive CBP/beta-catenin antagonist PRI-724 intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-7 , bevacizumab IV 30 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 8 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil Arm I . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month .</detailed_description>
