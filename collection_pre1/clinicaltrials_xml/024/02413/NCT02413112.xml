It recommend Finland old individual ( 65yr ) perform resistance training twice per week . Unfortunately , approx . 5 % old individual fulfill recommendation . As Finnish society grow ever old , research focus specific need group improve participation physical activity , may ultimately lead modification physical activity recommendation - resistance training recommendation currently young old adult include specific recommendation type resistance training .

Therefore , great importance identify number resistance training session per week require induce improvement physical fitness , metabolic bone health status , importantly reason adherence to/drop-out resistance training intervention ( e.g . motivation train ) multi-discipline study . This knowledge would benefit policy maker update current recommendation resistance training devise strategy advise realistic target resistance train old , particularly less-educated , age group ( e.g . TELI-strategy 2020 ) . The present study include 12-month resistance training intervention 12-month follow-up period . Interviews questionnaires assess psychological/sociological data collect drop-out subject complete intervention . Neuromuscular performance functional capacity test use conventional method , along body composition , bone density , blood test metabolic marker health . Diet physical activity control throughout intervention period . Measurements perform every 3 month . It expect 5 international peer-reviewed article publish 2016-2017 . The data present international national conference 2015-2017 . Finally , result entire research publish national peer-reviewed journal ( e.g . The Age Institute 's `` Raportteja '' ) .
