	<detailed_description>Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) , inflammatory joint disease associate psoriasis ( Ps ) , affect approximately 650,000 adult United States associate increased morbidity mortality . Bone damage develop half patient within first two year disease , often leave impaired function diminish quality life . The emergence anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapy ( TNFi ) dramatically improve clinical response slow bone cartilage degradation PsA patient , however , 50-60 % patient respond agent . To improve outcome , investigator must address two major gap : limited understand key event underlie pathologic bone destruction absence biomarkers predict TNFi response identify early TNFi responder facilitate optimization therapy . Bone damage mediate osteoclast arise monocyte precursor blood . Osteoclast Precursors ( OCPs ) dramatically increase PsA , compare control , particularly patient bone damage X-ray . The number circulation precursor cell drop rapidly follow treatment TNFi . OCPs may serve response biomarkers , cost , time high variability limit assay . Osteoclast precursor express Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein ( DC-STAMP ) , seven-pass transmembrane protein require fusion monocyte form osteoclast giant cell . Monocyte DC-STAMP level drop rapidly follow treatment TNFi . TNF receptor-associated factor 3 ( TRAF3 ) , inhibitor OC formation correlate extracellular TNF concentration , elevate OCPs PsA patient . These marker may predict TNFi treatment response . The goal study examine Psoriatic Arthritis patient prior standard care biologic treatment TNFi , also examine DC-STAMP TRAF3 expression cross-sectional analysis patient stable oral disease modify agent ( DMARDS ) patient low disease activity state TNFi therapy . - Research Assays : The correlation TRAF3 DC-STAMP expression RNA protein level may examine two baseline PsA patient real-time PCR , flow cytometry western Chloroquine ( CQ ) blockade , prevents TRAF3 degradation . Cells isolated human PBMC may sterile sort prior use vitro assay . Sorted cell may treat CQ MG132 , proteasome inhibitor , OC-promoting medium time course dose-response experiment OCs count determine DC-STAMP degrade lysosome proteasome . Peripheral Blood Mononucleated Cells ( PBMCs ) isolate blood centrifugation . These cell may use flow cytometry analyze TRAF3 DC-STAMP expression monocyte along OC quantification baseline and/or approximately 4 month treatment . DC-STAMP surface expression PBMC PsA patient correlate number OCP culture level DC-STAMP CD14+ monocyte decline significantly PsA patient follow TNFi . The decline DC-sTAMP+CD14+ cell may serve measure early response TNFi .</detailed_description>
