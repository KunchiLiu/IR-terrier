	<brief_title>Comparison Between Augmented Recession Posterior Scleral Fixation Partially Accommodative Esotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomize interventional comparative study 50 patient partially accommodative esotropia undergo surgical correction residual angle follow : 25 patient undergo bilateral medial rectus muscle recession residual angle far along posterior scleral fixation . 25 patient undergo bilateral medial rectus muscle recession use Augmented Formula take average angle deviation far correction angle deviation near without correction . Prior surgical intervention , patient undergo complete ophthalmic orthoptic examination give full cycloplegic refraction . Ocular motility analyze use cover/uncover alternate cover test deviation measure use prism cover test patient wear full cycloplegic correction view accommodative target require near distance fixation .</detailed_description>
