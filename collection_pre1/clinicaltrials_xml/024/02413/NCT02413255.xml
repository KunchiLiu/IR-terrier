	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Ascending Single- Multiple-Doses TAK-020 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-020 . TAK-020 test find safe well-tolerated dose . This study look pharmacokinetic characteristic ( drug act throughout body ) drug safety tolerability ( lab result , vital sign , ECG , side effect ) healthy people take TAK-020 . The study enroll total approximately 128 participant . This study design consist 2 sequential part : Part 1-a SRD , Part 2-a MRD . The study population Part 1 consist 72 participant enrol 9 cohort . Each cohort 8 randomize participant 6 receive single dose TAK-020 , 2 receive match placebo fast condition . In Cohorts 1-8 dos 0.1 , 0.5 , 2.5 , 4.4 , 8.8 , 17.5 , 35 , 70 mg evaluate . For Cohort 9 , subsequent dose level determine follow review safety , tolerability PK data previous cohort , propose 105 mg . The study population Part 2 consist 56 participant enrol 7 cohort . Each cohort 8 randomized participant . 6 participant receive one dose TAK-020 Day 1 daily dose Days 3-9 TAK-020 , depend whether washout require , 2 receive match placebo fast condition . This single-center trial conduct US . The overall time participate study 45 day . Participants Part 1 make multiple visit clinic include period confinement clinic contact telephone 14 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment . Participants Part 2 make multiple visit clinic include period confinement clinic observe clinic 17 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
