	<brief_summary>There study literature evaluate vibration whole body patient chronic renal failure . The study aim assess effectiveness whole body vibration patient renal disease final phase interdialytic period . It randomize , triple-blind , control randomize . The pilot study 20 individual initially . In intervention patient randomly divide two group : sham platform platform . As result expect training whole body vibration may promote patient compliance , since require less physical effort implementation great comfort application , thus allow sedentary / less active patient benefit minimize harmful effect physical inactivity associate pre-existing kidney problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies chronic kidney disease conventional hemodialysis physical therapy exercise relevant intervention treatment maintenance quality life patient , recent study show significant result also train whole body vibration , especially muscle strengthen , balance quality life patient different disease . However , study literature analyze whole-body vibration patient chronic renal failure . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness wholy body vibration patient renal disease final stage interdialytic period . Materials Methods : A clinical trial randomize , triple-blind ( patient , appraiser statistic ) control supplied random distribution . The study conduct Cardiopulmonary Therapy Physical Therapy Laboratory Federal University Pernambuco ( UFPE ) . The sample calculate pilot study carry previously . The pilot study 20 subject , 10 patient two group . In intervention patient randomly assign one two group : platform platform sham . Training twice week 3 consecutive month . The evaluation conduct two period : intervention . The assessment tool include : isokinetic dynamometer evaluate maximal voluntary isometric contraction knee extensor , Biodex Balance System evaluate static dynamic body balance , quality life questionnaire specific Chronic Renal patient - Kidney Disease Quality Life - short Form ( KDQOL-SFTM ) , 6-minute walk test ass functional capacity patient . Expected result : It expect train vibrate platform promote patient compliance , since require less physical effort implementation great comfort application , thus allow sedentary patient / less active benefit , thus minimize harmful effect physical inactivity associate pre-existing kidney problem .</detailed_description>
