	<brief_summary>In study , patient diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) treat adjuvant imatinib 3 year surgery randomly allocate 1:1 ratio receive imatinib ( Gleevec ) 2 year ( Arm A ) stop imatinib ( Arm B ) . The study participant require histologically verified GIST high risk GIST recurrence despite removal macroscopic GIST tissue surgery 3 year adjuvant imatinib . The high risk GIST recurrence define one following : gastric GIST mitotic count &gt; 10/50 high power field ( HPFs ) microscope , non-gastric GIST mitotic count &gt; 5/50 HPFs , tumor rupture . Study participant allocate Arm A receive imatinib 400 mg/day 24 month date randomization . All study participant follow use blood test computerize tomography ( MRI ) abdomen . The computerized tomography examination perform 6 month interval . A total 300 patient enter study . The study hypothesis adjuvant imatinib give total 5 year may prevent GISTs recur compare patient receive adjuvant imatinib 3 year , may difference rate GIST recurrence two group .</brief_summary>
