	<brief_summary>Total joint replacement common clinical practice patient suffer disable arthritis , since provide significant pain relief functional recovering . Nevertheless , outcome compromise complication periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) , report occur 1 4 % primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , approximately 1 % primary total hip replacement ( THR ) . Despite effort restrain PJI , prevalence may reach even high proportion patient undergo resection arthroplasty irrigation débridement infect prosthesis . That say , timely diagnosis early isolation infect microorganism utterly important , proper care deliver . The gold standard diagnosis PJI isolation microorganism intraoperative culture , combine sonication retrieve joint implants1 . This technique apply sound energy agitate disrupt biofilm , dislodge adherent bacteria bone cement , prove sensitive method conventional intraoperative culture . False-negative percentage report 15 % patient receive extend antibiotic prophylaxis 60 % extend antibiotic therapy administer . Regardless adequate clinical , radiographic surgical suspicion confirm PJI , organism always successfully isolated intraoperative culture , increase false negative result . This fact try explain several author , postulate antibiotic prophylaxis could interfere isolation microorganism intraoperative culture . As result , act accordingly hypothesis , preoperative antibiotic often withhold intraoperative culture obtain , hop tissue load antibiotic . Nevertheless , one aware adverse consequence practice may result systemic dissemination infection . Moreover , Ghanem Stephen recently conclude antibiotic prophylaxis interfere isolation microorganism intraoperative culture , despite study lack statistical power . Therefore , clear report study field support preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis administration , well withdrawal , intraoperative culture obtain . This decision department study depend exclusively treating surgeon judgment . In fact , 48 % patient admit study hospital PJI receive preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis , could relate high false-negative intraoperative culture sonication result . Thus , investigator add substance chelation property hemoculture container inoculate sonication sample . This practice offset antibiotic interference intraoperative culture prove enhance microorganism detection rate . That say , give lack scientific evidence clinical practice investigator willing engage prospective randomize double-blind clinical trial , allow u determine whether intraoperative culture sonication sample affect antibiotic prophylaxis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIM AND RATIONALE : Hypothesis : H0 : Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis patient PJI interfere isolation microorganism intraoperative culture sonication sample , result high false-negative result . H1 : Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis patient PJI interfere isolation microorganism intraoperative culture sonication sample . Goals : Main Goal : - Determine preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis outcome culture obtain intraoperatively . Secondary Goals : - Ascertain organisms isolated preoperative joint aspirate correspond isolate intraoperative culture ; - Verify addition substance chelation property hemoculture container fill sonication sample affect antibiotic prophylaxis outcome ; - Make descriptive analysis revision microorganism implicate PJIs . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Prospective , Randomized , Double-blind Clinical trial ( Level I Evidence ) : Group I ( study group ) : antibiotic prophylaxis + empiric antibiotic treatment obtain intraoperative culture result . Group II ( control group ) : Empiric antibiotic treatment obtain intraoperative culture result . At present institution , investigator routinely administer intravenous prophylactic antibiotic , first-generation cephalosporin ( 2g cefazolin ) , Glycopeptide derivatives ( 1g Vancomycin ) penicillin allergy report . This antibiotic administration schedule initiate 30-60 minute , 60 minute surgery , respectively . Empiric antibiotic treatment ( vancomycin 1g/12h + ceftazidim 2g/8h ) administer aspiration culture result negative , infect microorganism unknown . Contrariwise , infect microorganism isolated antibiogram know , target antibiotic therapy use accordingly . Patients assign group use computer generate random selection scheme Statistic Assessment Department . Both doctor patient blind information ensure differences way information assess manage , order minimize bias . The study placebo solution prepare nurse duty accord anesthesiologist recommendation . The surgical technique perform vary accord type infection . In chronic infection investigator proceed remove infected prosthesis implant cement spacer , whereas acute infection adopt technique irrigation débridment liner exchange retention component . Once obtained intraoperative culture sonication sample , antibiotic prophylaxis regimen initiate vancomycin ( 1g/12h ) ceftazidim ( 2g/8h ) , acute chronic infection . In case positive synovial fluid aspiration result , investigator perform target antibiotic treatment accord antibiogram . Hence , patient assign control group able receive adequate antibiotic coverage . Additionally , guideline clinical recommendation use antibiotic prophylaxis first-stage exchange , irrigation débridment procedure . The protocol surgical technique perform , well prosthetic model cement spacers investigator use Department Orthopaedic surgery Traumatology study center , already approve proper board review . That say , clinical trial suppose modification current clinical practice , neither microbiological technique method apply . Data collection : - Preoperative data : gender , age , weight , Body Mass Index , comorbidities , type prosthesis , mean time diagnosis , preoperative joint aspirate microbiologic analysis blood cell count . - Intraoperative data : Whether antibiotic use type antibiotic use . - Postoperative data : Intraoperative culture result microbiological technique employ . The investigator consider false-negatives patient meet infection criterion refer ( see inclusion criterion ) present negative culture result . The routine surgical follow-up schedule 4 , 6 , 12 24 week surgical intervention , recommend study hospital protocol . STATISTICS : Statistical analysis : Firstly , investigator perform descriptive analysis study population . Whereas categorical variable express number frequency , parameter measure continuous scale represent mean standard deviation , case follow normal distribution . Otherwise , investigator employ quartile median value describe . Secondly , bivariate analysis compare parameter group patient assign execute , use Chi Square Fisher test describe categorical variable . As qualitative parameter , variance analysis do variable follow normal distribution . Otherwise , Kruskal-Wallis Man-Whitney test use . Finally , investigator employ relative risk method evaluate negativization risk . The investigator consider statistically significant p value 0.05 use SPSS 18.0 ( SPSS inc , Chicago- Illinois ) software Prism ( 6.01 version , Graphpad , La Jolla , CA ) graphical analysis . Sample Size : The investigator undertake Chi Square difference test determine sample size , assume 15 % false negative rate control group , 60 % false negative rate study group 10 % rate lose follow-up . The test reveal 14 patient need group detect statistically significant difference , establish α error 0.05 statistical power 80 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>define previously All patient diagnose PJI meet Zimmerli criterion undergo firststage exchange , débridment retention procedure , case acute infection . These criterion : visible sinus tract purulence surround prosthesis ; detection infect microorganism synovial fluid aspiration sample , intraoperative tissue and/or fluid culture ; synovial white blood cell count histopathology parameter . The investigator also include additional criterion , prosthetic loosening 2 year primary arthroplasty implantation follow recent Portillo finding . The investigator include hip , knee shoulder replacement . Patients receive kind antibiotic regimen previous week surgery ; Hemodynamically unstable patient need antibiotic therapy , previously surgery .</criteria>
