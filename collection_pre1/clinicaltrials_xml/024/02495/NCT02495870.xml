	<brief_summary>Cooking meat low temperature prolong time widely use among chefs food service due possibility obtain consistent appeal eating quality . The method generally term low-temperature long-time ( LTLT ) cooking . In LTLT cooking , meat vacuum-packed heated temperature 50°C 65°C water bath several hour . LTLT several benefit - improve tenderness juiciness , less cooking loss , good vitamin retention uncompromised food safety . A recent PhD thesis conclude one mechanism behind change eat quality LTLT cooking due proteolytic degradation muscle tissue . The activity proteolytic enzyme show dependent heating temperature time cathepsins find remain active heat treatment . At 58°C cathepsin B+L activity increase compare 48°C 53°C 55°C compare 25°C , 40°C 70°C . A prolonged heating time 17 hour 58°C also show increase cathepsin B+L activity . The proteolytic degradation result occurrence peptides amino acid tryptophan , tyrosine , leucine histidine could lead faster degree satiety consume . According aminostatic hypothesis Mellinkoff , rise plasma amino acid elicit protein ingestion could assist suppression food intake onset satiety . The investigator therefore hypothesize ingestion LTLT cook pork would induce fast satiety response due high availability peptide amino acid prior digestion . An acute meal study elucidate . LTLT cooking perform `` cook-chill '' method mimic real life meat rapidly chill heat treatment , store 0-2°C reheated brown prior serving .</brief_summary>
