	<brief_title>Trial Intravenous Fenretinide Emulsion Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , single arm efficacy safety study patient relapse refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma , fail least two prior system therapy . Approximately 140 patient enrol . Patients treat fenretinide ( 4-HPR ) intravenous emulsion administer continuous intravenous infusion 5 day , every 3 week disease progression unmanageable treatment-related toxicity . The primary study endpoint objective response rate ( ORR ) . Responses categorize use criterion establish International Harmonization Project Lymphoma . Safety evaluate study 30 day last administration study drug . Adverse event laboratory study grade accord NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient &gt; 18 year histologically cytologically confirm Peripheral Tcell lymphoma ( PTCL ) Diseases refractory/relapsed one systemic cytotoxic therapy ; patient must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Patients ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 , estimate survival &gt; 12 week . Patients least ONE follow site measurable disease accord International Workshop Criteria87 : A ) Measurable tumor MRI CT scan . Measurable define least one lesion 20 mm least one dimension ; spiral CT , measurable define 10 mm least one dimension . For patient persistent disease , biopsy bone marrow , bone , soft tissue site , must demonstrate viable tumor . If lesion radiate , biopsy must do least 4 week radiation complete . B ) Bone marrow tumor cell see routine morphology ( NSE stain ) bilateral aspirate and/or biopsy one bone marrow sample , except patient test positive subsequent last treatment regimen patient negative marrow within three month study entry . Unable give write informed consent Patients receive chemotherapy within 3 week first fenretinide treatment , receive investigational drug within 6 week first fenretinide treatment . Patients must otherwise recover toxicity prior therapy . Patient eligible radiation give site measurable disease unless subsequent disease progression site , biopsy site show viable tumor least 4 week radiation complete . Patients must receive small field ( focal ) radiation minimum 2 week prior study entry . A minimum 6 week require follow prior large field radiation therapy ( i.e . TBI , craniospinal therapy , whole abdomen , total lung , &gt; 50 % marrow space ) Patients uncontrolled systemic infection , coagulation disorder , major medical illness cardiovascular respiratory system . Patients active hepatitis infection . Growth factor ( ) : Must receive hematopoetic growth factor within 7 day study entry . Organ Transplant : Patients may NOT recipient organ transplant . Women pregnant and/or lactating . Patients major nonbiopsy surgery last 20 day . CNS lesion : A ) Patients CNS parenchymal meningealbased lesion present study entry NOT eligible due concern regard toxicity attribution . B ) Who active CNS disease history cranial irradiation exclude due concern regard toxicity attribution . Patients previously treat leptomeningeal disease brain metastasis without evidence remain tumor PET , MRI scan , spinal fluid eligible ; however patient currently take steroid prophylaxis seizures eligible . Patients document allergy egg product . Known history , positive test result human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Patients fast serum triglyceride &gt; 300 and/or hypertriglyceridemia require medication ( patient hypercholesterolemia : patient hypercholesterolemia without medication eligible ) . Patients concurrently take follow drug exclude : antioxidant , herbal alternative therapy medication , vitamin supplement ( especially vitamins A , C , E ) standard multivitamin dos , cyclosporine A analogue ; verapamil ; tamoxifen analogue , ketoconazole , chlorpromazine ; RU486 ; indomethacin ; sulfinpyrazone , tetracycline , nalidixic acid , nitrofurantoin , phenytoin , sulfonamide , lithium , amiodarone . If patient discontinue usage drug , eligible enrollment study ( screen visit ) one week 5half life drug question , whichever longer , discontinuation . For patient require medication , entry permissible permission medical monitor . Patients poorly control diabetes mellitus fast serum glucose concentration 200 mg/dl hemoglobin A1C 7.5 % . Patients know significant cardiac abnormality . Patients uncontrolled hypertension . Participation investigational treatment within 6 week prior enrollment concurrent study . Patients identified familial hyperlipidemia disorder . Patients document allergy soy product .</criteria>
