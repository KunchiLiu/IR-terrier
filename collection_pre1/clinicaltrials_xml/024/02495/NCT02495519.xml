	<brief_summary>Aggressive fibromatosis ( AF , also know desmoid tumor ) fibroproliferative neoplasm typically arise abdomen develop anatomic site , commonly extremities . These tumor relatively high local failure rate primary treatment use surgery and/or radiotherapy , although rarely give rise distant metastasis , multifocal , therefore , surgically resectable . Moreover , tumor may recur adjacent site surgical resection , underscoring limitation surgery palliative setting . Therefore , effective medical therapy AF need maintain quality life prolong survival.The goal current study well define activity imatinib treatment AF determine molecular basis response/nonresponse</brief_summary>
