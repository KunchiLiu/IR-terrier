	<brief_title>White Adipose Tissue Pregnancy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There gradual change metabolism pregnancy . This characterised switch normal level cholesterol , glucose bile acid early pregnancy high level lipid , glucose bile acid late pregnancy . This important ensure nutrient provide grow fetus . However , result woman develop metabolic disease pregnancy , e.g . gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy ( ICP ) . This project aim understand role metabolic tissue change metabolism pregnant woman . The investigator ask permission collect sample adipose tissue ( subcutaneous visceral fat ) woman surgical procedure . Specifically , investigator would like take small sample fat two time point : 1 . When caesarean section ( 3rd trimester pregnancy ) 2 . When laparoscopic surgery ectopic pregnancy ( 1st trimester pregnancy ) Samples take woman surgery part clinical care . The investigator request permission collect sample woman metabolic disease pregnancy ( GDM ICP ) match control ( woman uncomplicated pregnancy ) . The investigator also want collect blood sample . There evidence non-pregnant individual ( animal study ) adipose tissue different part body function different way . Subcutaneous fat typically fat storage tissue visceral adipose tissue play role metabolism fat . The investigator ' study mice suggest different fat store function differently pregnancy , may play role metabolic change cause dyslipidaemia susceptibility diabetes mellitus . The investigator aim identify similar change function adipose tissue human pregnancy , whether contributes development GDM ICP .</detailed_description>
