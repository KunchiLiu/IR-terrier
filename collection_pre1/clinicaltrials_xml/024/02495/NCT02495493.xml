	<detailed_description>Though significant decrease incidence last 70 year , gastric cancer remain significant health problem worldwide . Despite R0 resection adjuvant chemotherapy , prognosis patient locally advanced GC remain poor , 5-year survival rate 60 % . Therefore , active strategy improve survival outcome ongoing gastric cancer . Due nature gastric surgery , postsurgical recovery avoid administration systemic therapy and/or radiation prior surgical procedure . Furthermore , preoperative therapy theoretical advantage treat untouched tumor ( lack treatment-induced resistance ) , intact vascularization without fibrotic remodel tumor bed due surgical trauma . These consideration address clinical trial incorporate neoadjuvant treatment gastric cancer . Preoperative chemotherapy prove superiority surgery alone esophagogastric junction cancer Regarding pattern failure , locoregional recurrence surgical resection report 20-50 % case . To improve local control survival outcome , chemoradiotherapy neoadjuvant preoperative set widely apply . In recently publish meta-analysis , preoperative chemoradiotherapy combine surgery significantly reduce 5-year death rate compare surgery alone ( OR 0.57 , P=0.001 ) . Ajani et al report phase II preoperative chemoradiotherapy ( 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin 45 Gy radiotherapy ) localize gastric cancer . Among 34 stage II/III gastric cancer patient , 30 % pathologic complete response 24 % pathologic partial response ( &lt; 10 % residual carcinoma ) . Lowy et al also demonstrate 11 % 63 % complete , partial pathologic response preoperative chemoradiotherapy safe well tolerate . Based rationale , 28 clinical trial neoadjuvant chemotherapy ongoing gastric cancer ( clinicaltrial.gov ) investigator ' center also conduct neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy trial localize gastric cancer ( NCT01269255 ) .Currently , improve survival outcome , new cytotoxic compound irinotecan docetaxel combine 5-FU/cisplatin . However , triplet regimen often burden high toxicity serious neutropenic infection . Therefore , future trial neoadjuvant adjuvant setting need incorporate new molecular agent improve efficacy , less toxicity .</detailed_description>
