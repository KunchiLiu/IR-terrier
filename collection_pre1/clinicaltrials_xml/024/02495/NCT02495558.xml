	<brief_summary>The cough assessment fundamental weaning process give information possibility expel food secretion airway . The majority person suffer severe acquire brain injury able cough voluntary due severe cognitive deficit . In present study , would evaluate intensity reflex cough ( RC ) result would correlate wean outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cough Assessment Patients With Severe Acquired Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant undergo firstly RC assessment . RC would trigged inhalation 0.4M citric acid solution use ultrasonic nebulizer ( MO-03 Norditalia Elettromedicali ) . The face mask would connect spirometer nebulizer via bidirectional valve order measure Peak Cough Expiratory Flow ( PCEF ) RC . Secondly , would assess parameter wean protocol order verify feasible remove tracheostomy cannula . Hence , previous assessment positive , cannula 's patient would remove . The follow-up would take 96 hour decannulation order verify outcome weaning . In study , would recruit number 30 consecutive patient admit IRCCS Ospedale San Camillo . The data would firstly analyze use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test order verify distribution . Secondly would choose t-test parametric outcome Wilcoxon non parametric outcome . Thirdly , correlation Peak Cough Expiratory Flow RC wean outcome would complete use Pearson Test ( parametric ) Spearman test ( non parametric ) .</detailed_description>
