	<brief_title>Regional General Anesthesia Distal Radius Fracture Surgery Day Surgery Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We intend conduct single-center randomized clinical trial enroll 90 patient planned surgical treatment volar plate due displace distal radius fracture day surgery setting . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion ( see ) approach MD and/or RN study group day surgery provide verbal write information . If give inform write consent participate study randomize either general regional anesthesia . The ratio study arm 1:1 45 patient group . All patient receive standard preoperative oral analgesic . Standard procedures general regional anesthesia use . The regional anesthesia use supraclavicular brachial nerve block short- medium last local anesthetic . Patients receive general anesthesia supervise postoperative intensive/intermediate care unit stable acceptable pain level return regular care unit . All patient leave hospital day surgery . Following standard procedure Orthopaedic department patient non-circular cast two week pain-relieve . It remove standard two week check-up , time suture remove , X-ray perform patient start non-weight bearing mobilization wrist . The primary outcome total opioid consumption first 72 hour postoperatively . It measure total amount oral iv opioids administer hospital discharge well oral opioids patient consume discharge . The patient document consumption analgesic study diary first three postoperative day report telephone consume previous 24 hour . For detail secondary outcome see . The patient interview telephone first three postoperative day well two week . Questions include grade pain 10 point VAS-scale , grade postoperative nausea 10 point VAS-scale , experienced postoperative vomiting , would recommend method anesthesia friend relative . The fracture classify examine X-rays fracture reduction . Postoperative X-rays examine remain dislocation document . The patient fill injury-specific ( PRWE ) generic ( EQ5D ) form health-related quality life day surgery ( recall week injury ) 6 month . At 6 month occupational therapist perform test range motion ( ROM ) grip strength patient . Furthermore , intend analysis resource utilization two group . Time spent pre- , peri- postoperative unit document patient . All personal data handle secure way accord ethical legal regulation .</detailed_description>
