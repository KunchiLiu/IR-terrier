	<detailed_description>Premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) define spontaneous rupture membrane ( ROM ) onset uterine contraction . Its diagnosis often obvious woman present leakage amniotic fluid , could also turn difficult diagnostic dilemma . The diagnosis fetal membrane rupture conventionally make use clinical assessment . First , speculum examination , clinician look amniotic fluid leak cervical o . If clear fluid visualize leak cervical o , diagnosis positive fetal membrane rupture . More commonly , leak absent , extensive workup require , include nitrazine/pH testing , visual inspection pool fluid posterior fornix , microscopic evaluation collect specimen ( ferning ) . Although approach consider standard care , fraught inaccuracy , require intrusive examination may provide rapid diagnosis . Rapid , point care , qualitative immunochromatographic test ( ie. , Amnisure® , ActimProm® , Amnioquick® Complete ROM Plus® ) detect proteins find amniotic fluid high concentration , use diagnose rupture membrane ( ROM ) several year . In many hospital , Amnisure® replace sterile speculum exam standard care diagnose ROM . It identify Placental Alpha Microglobulin-1 ( PAMG-1 ) , 34 kd fetal glycoprotein , cervicovaginal secretion . ROM Plus® ActimProm®and Amnioquick® Complete+ new addition market test PROM . Both test use monoclonal/polyclonal antibody approach detect two different protein find amniotic fluid high concentration . They detect Placental Protein-12 ( also know Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1 - IGFBP-1 ) well Alpha Fetoprotein ( AFP ) . The aim study demonstrate substantial equivalence IGFBP-1/AFP test `` predicate device '' Amnisure® . Stated statistical term , aim demonstrate IGFBP-1/AFP test non-inferior Amnisure® term sensitivity specificity compare paired-sample fashion common referent standard ( gold standard ) , clinical assessment .</detailed_description>
