	<brief_summary>The effect active commute e-bike , compare `` classic '' bike , cardiorespiratory fitness vascular health largely unknown . To assess whether active commute e-bike classic bike increase peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) untrained overweight individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E-Bike Versus Classic Bike Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Riding electrically assist bicycle ( e-bike ) think suitable increase physical activity daily life , promote health , increase cardiorespiratory fitness normal-weight individual . The positive effect commute work normal bike cardiorespiratory fitness show important predictor cardiovascular mortality previous study . We think improve maximal oxygen uptake commute work e-bike vs. classic bike . Besides cardiorespiratory fitness assess arterial stiffness brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity independent predictor cardiovascular event all-cause mortality .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>body mass index 2535 kg/m2 , willingness commute work ebike normal bike least 3 time per week oneway distance â‰¥ 6 km . cycling leisuretime activity , active commuting work exercise training per week within 4 week start study , uncontrolled cardiovascular disease limit cardiorespiratory fitness , stage II arterial hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg ) , renal disease , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % ) , active malignancy chemotherapy past 6 month .</criteria>
