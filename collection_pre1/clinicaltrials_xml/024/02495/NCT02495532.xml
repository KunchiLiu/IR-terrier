	<brief_summary>Regional lymph node metastasis major determinant local recurrence overall survival rate patient colorectal cancer . Because poor prognosis associate presence lymph node metastasis , stage III colorectal cancer patient receive adjuvant treatment chemo / radiation therapy accord site tumor . Several author investigate use reveal solution lymph node clearance colorectal cancer . Most study compare conventional histopathological specimen examination lymph node clearing technique show use reveal solution increase mean number lymph node harvest , usually statistically significant manner . It still controversial impact use reveal solution upstage lymph node status consequently indication adjuvant therapy . Therefore conduct randomized clinical trial compare performance GEWF Carnoy solution histopathological examination patient colorectal cancer . The aim study determine lymph node reveal solution best performance ( increase mean number lymph node harvest lymph node upstage ) patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
