	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase IIB randomize control trial evaluate safety efficacy CSFD provide preliminary clinical efficacy evaluation combination CSFD elevation mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) patient acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The objective trial evaluate ( ) efficacy reduce intrathecal pressure ( ITP ) CSFD patient acute SCI ; ( ii ) preliminary efficacy combination CSFD elevation MAP compare elevation MAP alone improve neurologic motor outcomes patient acute SCI ; , ( iii ) safety intensive CSFD acute SCI patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage ( CSFD ) Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) affect 10,000-14,000 person per year United States ( Burke , Linden et al . 2001 ) . There 150,000-300,000 person live significant disability SCI give time ( Bernhard , Gries et al . 2005 ) . The average age incident case SCI 47 year 78 % case male ( DeVivo Chen 2011 ) . Estimates lifetime cost care someone SCI range $ 325,000 $ 1.35 million yearly cost society reach $ 8 billion ( Sekhon Fehlings 2001 ) . With good long term care technology , cost expect continue rise . Although significant advance accessibility people disability , goal medical science overcome physiological barrier impose injury allow individual regain pre-injury level neurological function ( Rowland , Hawryluk et al . 2008 ) . The injury spinal cord occur two phase . The first phase primary physical damage due impact energy compressive nature injury . The damage complex shearing axon , destruction cell body disruption microvasculature site injury . The secondary phase injury begin soon primary injury occur influenced many factor hypoxia , hypotension , extent primary injury . Spinal cord ischemia post-injury cause significant increase cell death significant neurological disability . Limiting tissue hypoperfusion post-injury decrease amount cell death axonal damage . Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage ( CSFD ) together increase mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) immediate post-injury period reduce spinal cord tissue hypoperfusion . By reduce spinal cord hypoperfusion elevation MAP , less cell death axonal damage occur , lead improvement neurological function . The feasibility CSFD mean reduce intrathecal pressure ( ITP ) patient acute SCI demonstrate small randomized control trial Kwon et al ( Kwon , Curt et al . 2009 ) . The limitation small sample size , broad inclusion criterion , lack statistical power calculation restrict drainage regimen ( maximum 10 mL per hour ) .</detailed_description>
