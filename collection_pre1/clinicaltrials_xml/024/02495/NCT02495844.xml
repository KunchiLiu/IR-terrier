	<criteria>Subject adult ( 18 year age ) Subject able understand study ICF assess Investigator . Subjects know mental retardation ( define IQ 70 ) eligible participate . Subject and/or caregiver consider reliable capable adhere protocol ( eg , able understand complete diary ) , visit schedule , medication intake scheme instruct accord judgment Investigator Subject fulfill ILAE ( 1989 ) criterion focal epilepsy ; clinical semiology describe fulfill criterion focal seizure ; electroencephalogram ( EEG ) read compatible focal epilepsy last 5 year ; subject seizure focal new ILAE criterion ; brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) head CT ( compute tomography ) perform randomization , scan perform last 5 year , report available . If scan perform within last 5 year epilepsy stable since last scan , new scan obtain Subject fail achieve seizure control ≥4 appropriately choose Antiepileptic Drug ( AED ) regimens adequate dose duration , include current treatment , document medical record per Investigator assessment patient report Subject currently treat stable dose least 1 AED 4 week prior Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) throughout duration Treatment Period without additional concurrent vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) neurostimulation treatment . The VNS must place least 12 month constant setting least 3 month battery life unit anticipated extend duration study prior Screening Visit throughout duration study During 4 week prior Screening ( Historical Baseline Period ) , subject must report average least 4 spontaneous observable focal seizure per week ( `` focal seizure '' refers partialonset seizure type IA1 , IB , IC , include type IA2 , IA3 , IA4 seizures ) , seizurefree period longer 3 day ( base Investigator assessment subject report seizure diaries available ) . The cutoff seizure frequency ( 4 seizure per week ) maximum seizurefree interval ( 3 day ) must maintain 2week Prospective Outpatient Baseline Period Female subject nonchildbearing potential ( premenarcheal , postmenopausal least 2 year , bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation , complete hysterectomy ) eligible . Female subject childbearing potential eligible use medically accept contraceptive method . Oral depot contraceptive treatment least ethinylestradiol 30 μg per intake use additional barrier contraception method , monogamous relationship vasectomized female partner , doublebarrier contraception acceptable method . The subject must understand consequence potential risk inadequately protect sexual activity , educate understand proper use contraceptive method , undertake inform Investigator potential change status . Abstinence consider acceptable method contraception Investigator document subject agree compliant line prefer usual lifestyle subject Male subject confirm study period period 3 month final dose , sexual intercourse woman childbearing potential , use barrier contraceptive ( eg , condom ) respective partner use additional contraceptive method Subject participate another study investigational medication ( medical device ) within last 30 day currently participate another study investigational medication ( medical device ) Subject know hypersensitivity component UCB0942 formulation similar drug ( LEV , BRV , benzodiazepine ) , history drug allergy , opinion Investigator UCB Study Physician , contraindicate her/his participation Subject current past psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , could compromise his/her safety ability participate study include history schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , severe unipolar depression .
