	<brief_title>Fimasartan Achieving SBP Target ( FAST ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized , double-blind , active control , 3-parallel group comparison clinical study evaluate anti-hypertensive efficacy safety Fimasartan patient mild moderate hypertension . Approximately 360 patient enrol 8 center South Korea . This study plan 6 visit 8 week . ( 2 week placebo run-in wash , 2 week treatment 4 week force titration ) All subject agree participate study give write informed consent voluntarily assess inclusion exclusion criterion receive investigational product ( placebo ) screen visit . During 14 day placebo run-in wash period , subject stop previous anti-hypertensive drug . After placebo run-in wash period , Subjects assess final eligibility start measure ambulatory blood pressure 24 hour . Subjects determine appropriate study allocate experimental group ( Fimasartan 60mg ) control group ( Valsartan 80mg ) Reference group ( Olmesartan 10mg ) randomly ratio 3:3:1.Subjects take investigational product daily 2 week double dose 4 week . The placebo period single-blinded treatment allocation study double-blinded .</detailed_description>
