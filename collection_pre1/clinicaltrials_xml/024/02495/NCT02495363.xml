	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational , single center study conduct Rabin Medical Center ( Beilinson Campus ) , Petach Tikva , Israel , tertiary university hospital . Sixty woman undergo breast tissue resection general anesthesia enrol filling informed consent form . As standard protocol hospital participant include woman undergo surgery general anesthesia , addition regional PEC block anesthesia . The use opioid substance surgery do discretion anesthesiologist , accord accept professional criterion . All participant undergo PEC block surgery general anesthesia aseptic condition , standard analgesia protocol department . Ultrasound guide PECS Block perform identify thoracic muscle . Following identification , investigator inject anesthetic solution contain conventional 25 cc Bupivacaine 0.25-0.5 % . The concentration determine upper dose limit 2 mg / kg 11 . At end operation participant transfer post anesthesia recovery supervision unit , standard protocol . The woman receive analgesic treatment accord accepted recovery unit protocols Beilinson Hospital , accord professional discretion anesthesiologist charge recovery unit . On postoperative day one participant ask fill questionnaire measure degree pain surgery , extent expect side effect exposure opioids This questionnaire base questionnaire measure quality QoR recovery general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
