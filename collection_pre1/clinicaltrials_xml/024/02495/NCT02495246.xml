	<brief_summary>This clinical trial healthy volunteer administer two experimental Ebola vaccine : ChAd3-EBO-Z Ad26.ZEBOV . Four group volunteer vaccinate vaccine one prime/boost regimen . All ChAd3-EBO-Z dos 1x10^11 vp Ad26.ZEBOV dose 5x10^10 vp . Group 1 receive ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV boost vaccine 28 day later . Group 2 receive Ad26.ZEBOV prim vaccine ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 28 day later . Group 3 receive ChAd3-EBO-Z priming vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV boost vaccine 56 day later . Group 4 receive Ad26.ZEBOV prim vaccine ChAd3-EBO-Z boosting vaccine 56 day later . The study assess safety vaccination , immune response vaccination . Immune responses measure test blood sample . The ChAd3-EBO-Z Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine call viral vectored vaccine . They make virus modify multiply . The virus extra DNA injection , body make Ebola protein ( Ebola develop ) , immune system build response Ebola without infect . Healthy volunteer recruit Oxford London , England . The study co-funded GSK Biologicals Crucell Holland BV .</brief_summary>
