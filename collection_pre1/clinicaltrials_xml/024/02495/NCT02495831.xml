	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Study Safinamide BCRP Substrate , Diclofenac , Concomitantly Administered Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According Xadago™ SmPC , safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP , therefore time interval 5 h keep dose safinamide medicinal product BCRP substrates Tmax ≤2 h ( e.g . diclofenac , pitavastatin , pravastatin , ciprofloxacin , methotrexate , topotecan glyburide ) . Following specific request EMA CHMP , present interaction study healthy male female volunteer conduct determine co-administration safinamide BCRP substrate alters plasma exposure BCRP substrate vivo . Diclofenac chosen among BCRP substrates consider large use general population . Diclofenac fact important analgesic anti-inflammatory drug , widely use treatment postoperative pain , rheumatoid arthritis , chronic pain . Consequently , diclofenac often use combination regimens undesirable drug-drug interaction may occur . Voltaren® , 50 mg soluble tablet , select among possible diclofenac product formulation peak concentration diclofenamic acid achieve approximately 1 h , i.e . le 2 h. The present interaction study design agreement FDA Guideline Drug Interaction study , take also consideration EMA guideline Investigation drug interaction .</detailed_description>
