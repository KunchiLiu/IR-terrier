	<brief_summary>A novel disposable sheathe gastroscope system show safe efficient clinical practice gastroscopy . This novel disposable sheathe endoscope system could effectively prevent cross-infection simply take contaminate sheath examination patient place new sheath endoscope . In way , investigator save endoscopic reprocessing time also decrease need endoscopic clean disinfect equipment . Participants may think place new sheath endoscope decrease success rate cecal intubation patient undergo screen colonoscopy . With new sheath endoscope scope insertion probably increase distension colonic lumen loop formation . The probable adhesion may increase discomfort investigator participant . But previous clinical study investigator ' team show participant ' feeling significant difference ( Z = -1.783 , P = 0.075 ) sheathe conventional group . No significant difference observe optical clarity , pathology detection rate . There complication , microbial contamination detect . Based study , investigator hypothesize compare conventional group , place new sheath endoscope significantly reduce success rate cecal intubation average patient . The aim study compare outcome colonoscopy place new sheath endoscope versus conventional method average participant . The primary outcome cecal intubation success rate . The secondary outcome include cecal intubation time , maximum pain score colonoscopy , overall pain score colonoscopy adenoma detection rate .</brief_summary>
