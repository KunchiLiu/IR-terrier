	<brief_summary>Muscle size decline around 0.5-1 % per year 50 year age , muscle strength decline twice fast muscle size . This may eventually lead loss independence task daily live become strenuous perform safely . Short period bed rest cause rapid loss muscle size strength , study use healthy old participant show age increase vulnerability muscle loss . However , unlikely healthy individual would face period bed rest unless suffer severe illness . In light , recent evidence show even reduce walk less 1,500 step per day two week cause 4 % loss leg muscle 65 year old . This amount activity roughly equivalent housebound , something may become common old age , example due prolong bad weather , minor injury illness . This study investigate cause stark muscle loss two week reduce activity , impact skeletal muscle function size , well balance , body composition , indicator general health body respond food exercise . Importantly , exercise strategy could reduce muscle loss period reduce activity also investigate . In brief , three group 10 old men ( age 65-80 year ) undertake two week reduce physical activity limit daily step &lt; 1,500/day . All group undertake re-training exercise programme ensure loss muscle strength size regain . One group control , whereby undertake step-reduction intervention re-training , protective exercise step-reduction intervention . This group allow u achieve primary objective determine influence two week reduce physical activity muscle strength size healthy old male . The two group undertake either four week strength exercise training step-reduction intervention , daily home base exercise 'snacking ' step-reduction intervention . The potential protective benefit exercise intervention reduce impact two week reduce activity muscle strength size , effect muscle re-gained afterwards , compare 'control ' group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall study design : This study structure randomise control trial two exercise treatment group one 'control ' group . All three group undergo 14-days reduce activity restrict daily walk less 1,500 step . One group undertake four week resistance exercise pre-training immediately prior 14-day step-reduction ( PT group ) , another group undertake short bout home-based exercise ( exercise snacking ) every day 14-day step-reduction ( ES group ) . The control group undertake 14-day step-reduction neither exercise strategy . All three group undertake two week laboratory base resistance exercise train immediately step-reduction period , offer six week gym base personal training , six month gym swim pool membership Team Bath Sports Training Village . Following advertisement study , interested potential participant ask contact chief investigator information via telephone email correspondence . Further detail include inclusion criterion provide verbally , full participant information sheet send potential participant feel meet inclusion criterion . If potential participant chooses consider inclusion trial , must sign consent form initial screening invite medical screening meeting member research team . Preliminary assessment : All potential participant undergo screen assess eligibility inclusion proceeding . This include objective assessment physical function ( Short Physical Performance Battery ) simple test walk speed , ability repeatedly rise chair , simple stand balance score base set criterion . Only participants score 7 12 eligible participate . Participants wear step-counter ( pedometer ) , physical activity monitor ( BodyMedia armband ) one week , ask record food drink consume three day ( include one weekend day ) use provide diet record sheet . Only individual average 3,500 step per day include study . At end monitoring period , eligible participant ask sign consent form main study , randomly assign experimental group minimisation . Familiarisation strength , power , balance assessment : Eligible participant invite laboratory two familiarisation session muscle strength , balance , neural drive testing tool . Participants ask wear light clothes comfortable perform exercise . These familiarisation session least five less 14 day apart , second session least five day start pre-training PT group , least five less 14 day pre-step-reduction main trial . Pre-training group : Participants PT group ask undergo baseline assessment muscle function ( include one-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) strength test set load subsequent training session ) , body composition , muscle size , muscle fibre pennation monitor effectiveness pre-training exercise intervention day second familiarisation session . Participants PT group attend ten resistance training session across four week prior 14-day step-reduction , session separate least 48 hour . The last training session take place three day first main trial pre-step-reduction . All exercise session fully supervise member research team . At begin fifth session , participant repeat 1RM incremental power test . Repetitions perform cadence 1:1 extension : flexion time , participant-selected pace less less five second per complete repetition . Rest interval set 90 120 second participant 's discretion . Participants complete standardise warm-up Keiser leg press perform familiarisation session , use recent 1RM . All exercise session include leg press leg extension exercise , follow either dumbbell calf raise , dumbbell curl press , dumbbell lateral raise , seat lateral pull resistance band . Main Trials take place day day two-week step-reduction : Participants ask report laboratory 10-hour overnight fast wear light clothing metal component . Measures participant 's height , weight , waist circumference determine . Body composition assess use whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan ( DEXA ) , peripheral quantitative compute tomography scan ( pQCT ) calf thigh , ultrasound scan calf thigh conduct . The pQCT ultrasound take dominant leg . Resting sample subcutaneous adipose tissue via biopsy technique venous blood via cannula obtain . Participants ingest 200 ml D20 undertake mixed meal tolerance test whilst remain rest comfortable bed armchair three hour blood sample draw intermittently cannula . A short lunch break take . Thereafter thigh muscle biopsy sample , participant undertake balance testing perform familiarisation , whilst wear Xsens 3D accelerometer foot , shin , thigh adhesive pad film two video camera record footage later kinematic analysis . The standard leg press warm-up use previously obtain 1-RM , incremental power test describe measure leg strength power perform . Following two minute recovery , participant complete assessment neural drive calf muscle , follow three set eight repetition 70 % 1RM leg press leg extension ( total 48 repetition ) . This protocol use stimulate stress response exercise , blood sample take immediately exercise complete muscle biopsy obtain contralateral leg 90-minutes seat rest post exercise . Whilst participant rest , ask complete two questionnaire ( The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , World Health Organization Quality Life questionnaire ( WHOQOL-BREF ) ) . Participants ES group give demonstration exercise snacking regime , ask complete bout exercise , show use exercise snack log book . Step-reduction : For next 14-days participant ask restrict daily step count 1500 step per day . A portable pedometer worn subject time throughout day ( exclude sleep ) allow accurate monitoring feedback step count . Participants ES group ask record number step bout exercise snacking exercise thus step take exercise snack exclude daily 1,500 step limit . Participants also wear physical activity monitor throughout first week intervention . They ask record dietary intake 1st , 7th 13th day step-reduction intervention use dietary diary . Other assessment : Biopsy 1 : On third day 14-day step-reduction , rest muscle biopsy blood sample take . Transport arrangement make reduce ambulation purpose visit . Participants ES group ask perform exercise snack laboratory . Biopsy 2 : On eighth day 14-day step-reduction , another muscle biopsy blood sample take , 100 ml dose D20 ingest . Follow biopsy : Three day 14-day step-reduction , final muscle biopsy blood sample take . Exercise Snacking regime : The exercise snacking require stable kitchen chair perform , supervision necessary though three bout perform laboratory . Participants ask perform five exercise , one minute follow one minute rest . In minute exercise , participant perform many control repetition exercise . Participants ask perform exercise snack three time daily , separate least two hour possible . The exercise : sit-to-stand chair , seat knee extension , stand knee bend , march spot , stand calf raise . A chair hold stability need . Participants always perform sit-to-stand exercise first , record number repetition complete minute , thereafter participant may alternate order exercise , ask record order log book provide . Re-training : After step-reduction participant attend six resistance training session 14-days session separate least 48 hour , first train session take place day follow biopsy sample take . These session take place laboratory , supervised member research team , follow train regime PT group undertake prior commence step-reduction . Thereafter , participant offer six week re-training supervise qualified personal trainer , train two time per week University Sports Training Village . Post re-training muscle size , strength , power , balance assessment : Follow-up assessment muscle function , balance , muscle size architecture make two day final session two-week laboratory base re-training , applicable two-days optional six-week gym base re-training ( optional ) . These assessment DEXA , pQCT ultrasound scan , leg press incremental power test , test neural drive , balance movement pattern assessment . Qualitative assessment well-being quality life : Following intervention participant invite take part interview provide feedback experience trial . Participants provide write information purpose interview ( i.e. , inform feasibility protocol ) reassure participation optional . Interviews take place via telephone person accord participant preference , digitally record , transcribe verbatim anonymized completion . The interview schedule cover ; ( ) participant ' perception impact inactivity mood , appetite , vitality , sleep participant-generated concern ( comparison across condition ) , ( ii ) adherence study protocol ( i.e. , participant adapt prescribed regime , factor suggest would make protocol easy adopt ) , ( iii ) participant exercise snack condition additionally ask discus perceive barrier facilitator , cost benefit exercise-snacking . Transcripts analyse systematically use framework analysis highlight key theme within across participant , result use facilitate participant input feasibility analysis protocol amendment .</detailed_description>
