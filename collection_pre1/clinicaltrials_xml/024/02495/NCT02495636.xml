	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study look effect , good bad , combine two investigational anti-cancer drug call MPDL3280A CDX-1401 . CDX-1401 give combination third agent , poly-ICLC , another investigational drug believe work together CDX-1401 . All investigational drug , MPDL3280A CDX-1401 conjunction poly-ICLC , evaluate separately prior study ; however , first study assess combination therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A . Signed Informed Consent B . Ability comply protocol C. Age ≥18 year D. Histologically cytologically document , locally advanced metastatic ( i.e. , Stage IIIB eligible definitive chemoradiotherapy , Stage IV , recurrent ) NSCLC ( per American Joint Committee /AJCC stag system ) E. Measurable disease , define RECIST v1.1 . Previously irradiated lesion count target lesion clearly progress radiation . F. Chemotherapy naive treat patient eligible , limit number prior therapy . Patients NSCLC know harbor ALK rearrangement , EGFR mutation know sensitive FDA approve tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , eligible experience disease progression ( treatment ) intolerance FDA approve EGFR TKI ALK TKI , respectively . G. Positive NYESO1 expression RTPCR and/or IHC required entry , determine analysis trial central laboratory . H. At least one tumor amenable excisional , core forceps ( transbronchial ) biopsy . Patients must willing undergo tumor biopsy start therapy 3rd CDX1401 injection . Additionally , first 12 patient enrol must consent third tumor biopsy perform 3rd MPDL3280A infusion . I. ECOG performance status 0 2 J . For female patient childbearing potential male patient partner childbearing potential , agreement ( patient and/or partner ) use highly effective form ( ) contraception ( i.e. , one result low failure rate [ &lt; 1 % per year ] use consistently correctly ) continue use 6 month last dose trial therapy . Highly effective contraception one failure rate &lt; 0.1 % . Birth control pill achieve rate . K. Adequate hematologic endorgan function , define follow laboratory result obtain within 14 day prior first study treatment : ANC ≥1500 cells/μL ( without granulocyte colonystimulating factor support within 2 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ) Platelet count ≥100,000/μL ( without transfusion within 2 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ) Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ( Patients may transfuse meet criterion ) AST , ALT , ALP ≤2.5 xULN , follow exception : Patients document liver metastasis : AST and/or ALT≤5 x ULN ; Patients document liver bone metastasis : ALP ≤5 x ULN Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 xULN ( Patients know Gilbert disease serum bilirubin level ≤3 xULN may enrol ) INR aPTT≤1.5 x ULN ( This apply patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation ; patient receive therapeutic anticoagulation stable dose ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 xULN creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min A . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 3 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Subjects vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Subjects require intermittent use inhale steroid local steroid injection would exclude study . Subjects hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic therapy ( within past 3 year ) exclude study . B. Generalized dermatologic condition ( allergic reaction , infection , edema , scar ) allow study drug administration site normal skin evaluation localize adverse event . C. Symptomatic untreated CNS metastasis . Patients history treat asymptomatic CNS metastasis eligible , provide meet follow criterion : No evidence interim progression completion CNSdirected therapy start trial therapy . No ongoing requirement dexamethasone therapy CNS disease ; anticonvulsant stable dose allow . Completed stereotactic radiation least 1 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 wholebrain radiation least 2 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 D. Treatment systemic immunosuppressive medication ( include limit , prednisone dos &gt; 10 mg ( equivalent dose corticosteroid ) , cyclophosphamide , tacrolimus , sirolimus , azathioprine , methotrexate , thalidomide , antitumor necrosis factor [ antiTNF ] agent ) within 2 week prior CDX1401 administration ( Inhaled topically apply steroid , acute chronic standarddose NSAIDs permit . Replacement steroid also permit ) . E. Any approve anticancer therapy , include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy within 3 week prior initiation study treatment ; follow exception allow : Hormonereplacement therapy oral contraceptive TKIs approve treatment NSCLC discontinue &gt; 7 day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . The baseline scan must obtain discontinuation prior TKIs . F. Treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial therapeutic intent within 28 day prior enrollment ; follow exception allow : Unapproved/ experimental TKIs discontinue 14 day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 G. Known infection HIV , HBV HCV . Patients prior exposure hepatitis , evidence active chronic infection , may eligible . H. Active systemic infection require systemic antibiotic treatment within 72 hour prior first dose study treatment I. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement J . Women pregnant lactating . K. Any underlying medical condition Principal Investigator 's opinion make administration study drug hazardous patient would obscure interpretation adverse event . L. Previous administration vaccine therapy target NYESO1 M. Prior treatment immune checkpoint blockade therapy , include antiCTLA4 , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 therapeutic antibody</criteria>
