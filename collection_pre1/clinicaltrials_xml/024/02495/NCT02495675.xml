	<brief_title>Effects Treatment With High Flow Nasal Cannulas Respiratory Pattern Work Breathing Among Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High flow oxygen therapy ( HFOT ) promising technique increasingly used management acute respiratory failure . In hospitalised hypoxemic patient , recent clinical evidence show HFOT reduce endotracheal intubation reduce mortality . Physiologically , HFOT cause decrease respiratory rate minute-ventilation may associate decrease carbone dioxyde arterial pressure . It possible effect associate decreased work breathing , could explain benefit term comfort efficiency . The objective research evaluate impact wash-out anatomical dead space high flow nasal cannulas respiratory parameter work breathe among healthy subject . The investigator evaluate baseline status room air , compare four different level flow . The primary endpoint work breathing .</detailed_description>
