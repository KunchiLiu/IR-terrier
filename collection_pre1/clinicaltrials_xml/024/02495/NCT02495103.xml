	<brief_summary>Background : - There establish treatment people certain advanced kidney cancer . These tumor often respond well currently available treatment . Researchers believe two drug treat disease metformin vandetanib could help people advanced kidney cancer . Objective : - To test combination metformin vandetanib people advance kidney cancer . Phase I study determine safe dose drug . Phase II test dose people certain kidney cancer . Eligibility : - For Phase I , people 18 advanced kidney cancer - For Phase II , people 18 advanced hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer ( HLRCC ) , succinate dehydrogenase renal cell carcinoma ( SDH-RCC ) , advance papillary renal cell carcinoma relate hereditary syndrome Design : - The study last many month . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants take study drug mouth every day . - Participants measure record blood pressure every day . - Participants many test : - Blood urine test - MRI , CT , PET scan , imaging test : lie machine take picture body . - ECG : soft electrode stuck skin . A machine record heart signal . - Bone scan - Some participant may gynecology evaluation photo skin tumor take . - Participants optional tumor biopsy . - After stop taking drug , participant may medical history , physical exam , blood test .

	<brief_title>Vandetanib Combination With Metformin People With HLRCC SDH-Associated Kidney Cancer Sporadic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - The management advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) continue remain challenge , particularly patient papillary non-clear cell variant RCC , standard therapy proven benefit . - Inactivation Krebs cycle enzyme Fumarate Hydratase ( FH ) tumor associate hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer ( HLRCC ) result metabolic shift characterize ) reliance aerobic glycolysis energy production , b ) upregulation HIF 1- downstream target promote glucose delivery uptake fuel aerobic glycolysis , c ) downregulation AMPK , result activation mTOR pathway increase macromolecule synthesis . - Inactivation another Krebs cycle enzyme , Succinate Dehydrogenase ( SDH ) , also associate familial form kidney cancer share metabolic feature . - Vandetanib dual VEGFR/EGFR inhibitor reverse metabolic phenotype associate FH ( SDH ) inactivation potent preclinical activity FH-/- SDH -/- tumor . Metformin activate AMPK demonstrate potent synergy combine vandetanib , preclinical model FH -/- tumor . - In phase 1/2 trial , first propose establish safety dose parameter combine vandetanib metformin therapy . We propose test activity vandetanib combination metformin patient HLRCC SDH-associated RCC , well sporadic form papillary RCC . OBJECTIVE : Phase I Component : -Establish safety maximum tolerate dose combination vandetanib metformin patient advanced RCC . Phase II Component : -Determine overall response rate ( RECIST 1.1 ) follow treatment combine vandetanib/metformin patient 1 ) advance RCC associate hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) succinate dehydrogenase renal cell carcinoma ( SDH-RCC ) , 2 ) advance sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma . ELIGIBILITY : Phase I Component : - Diagnosis advance RCC - Patients clear cell RCC must either decline , unable receive , progress , intolerant high-dose IL-2 establish first second line VEGF and/or mTOR target agent - No prior therapy require patient non-clear cell RCC , prior therapy allow Phase II Component : - Diagnosis advance RCC associate HLRCC SDH-RCC ( cohort 1 ) sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary RCC ( cohort 2 ) - No 2 prior regimens VEGF-pathway antagonist General requirement Phase I II : - Age great equal to18 - Brain metastasis spinal cord compression require treatment , unless treatment end least 4 week start protocol therapy condition stable without steroid treatment least 10 day - No major surgery within four week inadequately heal wound prior study enrollment - Adequate organ function DESIGN : Phase I Component : - Combination vandetanib metformin administer start dos 300 mg QD 250 mg BID , respectively . - The study design base single arm , fix order dose-escalation Phase 1 study use modify Fibronacci schema . - Up 6 patient may enrol specific dose combination cohort . Based assumption 3 dose level evaluate , total number evaluable patient 18 . To allow patient may inevaluable , accrual ceiling portion study set 21 . Based dose escalation proceeds adverse event see , total number patient accrue may change via protocol amendment . Phase II Component : - Once MTD determine , appropriate combination dose evaluate phase 2 component . - Patients accrued one two independent , parallel cohort : - Cohort 1 Patients advanced HLRCC SDH associate RCC . - Cohort 2 Patients advanced sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary kidney cancer . - Patients evaluate response every 8-12 week use RECIST 1.1 . - The study base open label two-stage optimal phase II design . - The accrual ceiling portion study 21 patient cohort .</detailed_description>
