	<brief_title>Study Bendamustine IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) Plus Dexamethasone Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW : This Phase I/II study design first identify dos MLN9708 bendamustine associate acceptable adverse event profile deliver together 28-day cycle . Additionally , study aim assess efficacy combination patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . Responders ( stable disease ) , continue receive eight cycle total absence progressive disease . DOSE ESCALATION/DE-ESCALATION : This study aim assess combination 's efficacy patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . Responders ( stable disease ) , continue receive eight cycle total absence progressive disease . The dose MLN9708 fix 4 mg , day 1 , 8 15 . Dexamethasone administer 40 mg oral Days 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle . The dose MLN9708 fix 4 mg , day 1 , 8 15 . Dexamethasone administer 40 mg oral Days 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle . Three dos bendamustine evaluate ( Dose 1 : 70 mg/m2 , day 1 2 ; Dose 2 : 80 mg/m2 . day 1 2 ; Dose 3 : 90 mg/m2 , day 1 2 ) . PHASE 1 DESIGN : A 3+3 design employ . At dose , three patient initially evaluate . If dose limit toxicity observe , bendamustine dose increase ; one dose limit toxicity observe , three additional patient treat dose escalation occur additional DLTs observe . A dose 2 DLTs observe 3 6 patient judge toxic low dose define maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The phase I portion study expect complete enrollment 12 patient . Should patient require , protocol amend . PHASE 2 DESIGN : Design Phase II portion study : Once MTD recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination identify , plan treat additional patient dose assess efficacy response treatment . The investigator plan enroll 14 patient ( include treat MTD Phase I ) continue enrollment observe overall response rate least 28.6 % ( 4/14 ) . If enrollment continue response rate least 21 % enrollment continue , investigator treat additional five patient ( 19 total ) consider combination `` interesting '' development least 6/19 patient ( 31.6 % ) achieve response .</detailed_description>
