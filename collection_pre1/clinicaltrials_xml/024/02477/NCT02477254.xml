	<detailed_description>Most case human papilloma virus ( HPV ) infection asymptomatic , transient resolve without treatment . However , individual , especially patient immunocompromised various underlying disease receive long-term immunosuppressive agent , HPV infection persistent may result genital wart , cervical smear abnormality , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) rarely cervical cancer . High-risk HPV serotypes oncogenic associate invasive cancer cervix vulva . Examples HPV 16 HPV 18 . HPV 16 account almost half cervical cancer whereas HPV 18 infection present 10-12 % cervical cancer . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) patient risk persistent HPV infection . This immune aberration relate disease immunosuppressive state induce various treatment . One study 85 SLE patient reveal 16.5 % prevalence abnormal Pap smear 12 % prevalence cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) routine screening , significantly high figure report age-matched healthy woman ( correspond figure abnormal Pap smear CIN 5.7 % 2 % , respectively ) . Thus , prevention HPV infection important patient SLE order reduce incidence CIN lesion hence invasive cervical cancer long run . The investigator conduct case-control study safety immunogenicity quadrivalent HPV vaccine , GARDASIL , 2010 . Fifty female SLE patient 50 age-matched healthy control study . At month 12 vaccination , sero-conversion rate anti-HPV serotypes 6 , 11 , 16 18 patient control 82 % , 89 % , 95 % , 76 % 98 % , 98 % , 98 % , 80 % , respectively . Injection site reaction common adverse event ( AE ) ( 5 % ) , incidence AEs comparable patient SLE control . The investigator plan study long-term immunogenicity ( durability immune response ) HPV vaccine cohort patient control follow 5 year . In particular , patient SLE , investigator would like evaluate effect disease flare ongoing immunosuppressive treatment immune response HPV serotypes 5 year vaccination .</detailed_description>
