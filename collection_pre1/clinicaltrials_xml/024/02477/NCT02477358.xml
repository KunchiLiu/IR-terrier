	<brief_title>The Use Platelet Rich Fibrin Pulpal Periodontal Regeneration Mature Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When tooth avulse , separate socket cause damage attachment apparatus . The periodontal ligament ( pdl ) group specialize connective tissue fiber attach cementum root ( out layer ) alveolar bone . Avulsion cause damage pdl possible cemental tear . If periodontal ligament leave attached root minimal time lapse occur damage tissue usually limit . In case , reimplantation widely accept treatment ; however long term success avulse tooth dependent various factor . When excessive drying occur prior re-implantation , severe inflammatory response elicit directly root surface may result osseous replacement replacement resorption . Some necrosis always occur avulsion injury , necrotic pulp little consequence , necrotic tissue high risk bacterial contamination . If pulp tissue revascularize endodontic therapy perform , pulp space become infected . It suggest treatment strategy attempt limit peri-radicular inflammation therefore promote favorable cemental heal limit unfavorable osseous replacement . Platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) second generation platelet concentrate allow clinician obtain fibrin membrane enrich platelet growth factor anticoagulant-free blood harvest without addition artificial biochemical modification . PRF demonstrate clinical relevance ability stimulate cell proliferation osteoblast , gingival fibroblast , periodontal ligament ( PDL ) cell . In addition , PRF show limit epithelial cell growth therefore promote connective tissue alveolar bone regeneration inhibit epithelial proliferation . These property make favorable product surgical procedure require micro vascularization . In vitro study PRF canine dental pulp cell demonstrate PRF 's ability promote chemotaxis proliferation pulp cell contribute pulp repair . When PRF combine human dental pulp cell derive extracted third molar interfere vitality stimulate proliferation differentiation . Additionally upregulated expression osteoprotegerin alkaline phosphatase . Animal model evaluate PRF granule combine human pdl stem cell place root surface freshly extract canine teeth . The teeth reimplanted evaluate histologically heal phase . A regeneration PDL-like tissue reduction ankylosis inflammation note animal PRF granule . Clinical relevance PRF revascularization demonstrate several case study avulsion . These case study utilize general protocol minimally instrument avulse tooth . One study perform 3 mm resection root apex follow minimal instrumentation canal . Blood drawn patient PRF prepare via Choukroun 's method . The PRF place root surface condense canal . The tooth reimplanted , splint , patient follow 24 month . The tooth test vital thermal percussion test radiographically show sign replacement resorption inflammation . To date human study perform evaluate effectiveness PRF pulpal revascularization reimplantation benefit limit inflammation . Additionally , histological evidence benefit PRF demonstrate animal model . If PRF capable promote revascularization mature teeth potential benefit extend limit need endodontic therapy follow mature tooth avulsion , potential mature tooth transplantation situation congenitally miss teeth , utilization PRF endodontic revascularization therapy . The following research would consist two phase : Phase 1 . An vitro model evaluate effect PRF limit inflammatory response pulp pdl cell culture presence inflammatory mediator . Phase 2 . An vivo model utilizing mature teeth previously treatment planned extraction , treat accordance procedure document one group , reimplanting teeth follow three four month extract perform histological analysis .</detailed_description>
