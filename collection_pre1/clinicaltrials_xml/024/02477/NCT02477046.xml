	<brief_summary>The Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization ( SAGE ) set plan replace trivalent oral polio vaccine ( tOPV ) bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) plus inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) routine immunization globally , institute 2015-2016 . At community level , impact change tOPV + IPV bOPV + IPV Sabin virus fecal-oral transmission ( duration circulation , degree genetic reversion ) persistence environmental contamination unknown . Also unknown impact change tOPV bOPV community circulation Sabin 2 special immunization ( SI ) activity monovalent oral poliovirus type 2 ( mOPV2 ) . Finally unknown level individual child type 2 fecal shed limited cross-protection oral vaccination Sabin type 1 3 . The investigator propose measure community level transmission Sabin 2 virus Bangladesh , low income country , fecal-oral transmission environmental exposure high , compare transmission set vaccination tOPV+IPV vs. bOPV+IPV . The study conduct 67 village Matlab , Bangladesh , use cluster-randomized study design . Villages Matlab randomly assign receive part routine immunization ( RI ) activity : ( 1 ) tOPV ( 6,10,14 week ) plus IPV 14 week ; ( 2 ) bOPV ( 6,10 , 14 week ) plus IPV 14 week ; ( 3 ) bOPV ( 6,10 , 14 week ) plus IPV 14 18 week . Community environmental surveillance Sabin 2 virus conduct village 9 month period RI activity . In addition , SI activity mOPV2 occur 9 month study model outbreak response . For 6 month follow mOPV2 challenge , impact different vaccination regimens Sabin 2 transmission community determine , well individual level protection ( measure fecal shed day 7-70 mOPV2 challenge ) .</brief_summary>
