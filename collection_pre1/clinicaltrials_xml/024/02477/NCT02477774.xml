	<brief_summary>This single-blinded multi-institutional randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness Arista hemostatic matrix powder ( AristaÂ® AH , C. R. Bard , Inc. Davol , Warwick , RI ) reduce drainage output anterolateral thigh ( ALT ) free flap donor site . Increased drainage donor sit lead seroma formation possible secondary infection , delay hospital discharge , additional home care need drain care . Arista inert plant base absorbable surgical hemostatic powder easily apply broad surgical field reduce bleed seroma rate . Therefore , application free flap donor site may bear significant potential benefit . Specific Aim 1 : The main hypothesis study use Arista anterolateral thigh ( ALT ) free flap donor sit prior closure reduce postoperative drain outputs time drain removal compare ALT donor site close without Arista . Specific Aim 2 : This study also evaluate secondary hypothesis Arista reduce postoperative ALT donor site seromas patient hospital length stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Free tissue transfer commonly perform procedure , especially tertiary care hospital . In free tissue transfer , `` spare tissue '' one area body ( donor site ) re-implanted area need reconstruction ( defect site ) . When relocate , `` spare tissue '' give vitality blood supply new location microscopically sew connect feed artery vein artery vein near defect site . Hence , operation refer `` microvascular free tissue transfer '' `` free flap '' . Defect sit commonly result tumor cancer removal trauma related injury . Free flap frequently use reconstruct breast tissue mastectomy , head neck cancer resection , extremity injury , chronically infected wound . The indication , utilization , expertise free flap surgery continue grow , provide patient enhance outcome otherwise difficult cancer wound . Since original description 1984 ALT microvascular free flap become increasingly integral part head neck reconstructive surgery.1 , 2 ALT free flap show reliable method several reconstructive procedure minimal donor site morbidity.2-4 The ALT free flap compose skin , subcutaneous tissue , fat anterolateral thigh . The blood supply area lateral circumflex femoral artery vein . These vessel along tissue anterolateral thigh carefully dissect remove single unit re-implanted different part body . Multiple option exist soft tissue free flap donor sit similar ALT . However , distinct advantage ALT free flap others minimal donor site morbidity patient undergoes . Patients able fully ambulate function surgery , leave well-healed scar line . Despite many advantage , postoperative fluid collection continue problematic ALT donor site . Studies report seroma rate ALT donor site high 5 % although likely underestimate true incidence clinically significant postoperative fluid collection wound complication patient population.2 ALT free flap require large amount tissue dissection removal , create large potential space lateral thigh often require prolonged postoperative suction drainage pressure dressing effort minimize fluid accumulation . Research optimal postoperative management ALT donor site lack . Current management without use Arista often require surgical drain 7-14 day , delay patient discharge expose patient increase risk postoperative wound infection . There paucity data method reduce ALT donor site drain output seromas . Surgeons often use combination close suction surgical drain pressure dressing try reduce amount fluid collection thigh donor site . Although provide advantage , technique require prolonged time , unnecessary hospital stay patient morbidity attain . According Healthcare Cost Utilization Project , average inpatient hospitalization 2009 cost $ 2,000 per day , increasing.5 If use single bottle Arista could reduce 1 hospital day per patient could save least $ 80,000 dollar year department alone . Further , associate morbidity health care cost potential seroma infect seroma complication may avoid . A randomized controlled trial aim evaluate improve method reduce postoperative drainage ALT donor site could provide critical information best serve patient , eliminate unnecessary hospital stay , reduce overall cost . Once study control single flap environment , method could expand free flap donor site . According manufacturer , Arista use Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres ( MPH ) technology catalyze clot cascade effectively dehydrate tissue initiate hemostasis broad area . Major advantage Arista show safe effective across multiple surgical discipline , completely absorb 24-48 hour , contain human animal components.6-8 Sindwani et al . first report effectiveness safety Arista hemostatic agent otolaryngology demonstrate application control postoperative bleeding endoscopic sinus surgery.8 Zhang et al . demonstrated success rate 100 % prevention seromas patient undergo resection malignant tumor multiple location , include low extremity.7 Arista recently show useful reduce postoperative chest tube output hemostasis time patient undergo cardiothoracic surgery.6 These previous work support idea Arista could effective reduce postoperative fluid collection drainage time free flap donor site . However , would new application Arista wide applicability previously describe . 1.1 Research Rationale Possible Influence On Clinical Practice Reconstructive surgery evolve recent era increase attention patient satisfaction cost saving . The ALT free flap prove highly successful ; however , optimal management donor site postoperatively area need additional gain via research . Decreasing free flap donor site drain output earlier drain removal could improve quality life patient , significantly decrease cost care , potentially decrease drain-associated infection . If study demonstrate Arista reduce postoperative donor site drainage seroma rate and/or decrease hospital length stay result early surgical drain removal , could dramatically affect way take care patient . This study seek critically evaluate current clinical practice paradigm well understand influence Arista use free flap donor site . A prospective , multi-institutional , randomize , control , single-blinded trial clearest methodology evaluate possible benefit Arista . Additionally , study ALT free flap alone , single commonly perform free flap , limit bias confound variable . No clinical trial level perform topic ; thus , proposal novel finding study potentially important .</detailed_description>
