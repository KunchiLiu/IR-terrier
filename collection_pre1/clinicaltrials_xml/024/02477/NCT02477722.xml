	<brief_summary>Exposure life threatening , traumatic stress induce event general inevitable part military combat service . Among individual expose traumatic event , approximately 85-90 % develop stress response recover without need medical intervention whatsoever . However , roughly 10-15 % continue suffer post-traumatic symptom along depression anxiety disorders1 , . The prominent symptom post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , consist relive event via invasive painful memory include : image , thought feeling , night terror , extreme emotional distress arise exposure external internal cue similar symbolize aspect traumatic event . Following distress , behavioral avoidance situation trigger unpleasant memory may develop . Such mental stress may lead avoidance social situation hinder normal daily function variety contexts2 . The question arise distinguishes expose traumatic event recover spontaneously fail resume daily life develop PTSD . Attempts find personality environmental risk factor development PTSD yet yield unequivocal conclusion . This lead scientific community look neuro-physical risk factor well . Furthermore , evidence early diagnosis treatment disorder help reduce severity post-trauma symptom -stresses need accurate localization neurological risk factor new immediate and/or preventative intervention . The aim present project develop brain oriented training method early preventive intervention PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The significant disadvantage current EEG-NF method low spatial resolution EEG , allow localization site activity within deep brain region know associated development PTSD , amygdala , hippocampus , mPFC . The aim present project overcome drawback integrate EEG fMRI image method , patient receive real-time feedback regard activation emotional target area locate deep within brain . FMRI base measurement metabolic change follow electrical activity brain , thus non-invasively represent neuronal activity various brain region perform emotional and/or cognitive task . fMRI high spatial resolution , contrast EEG - allow localization region deep within brain , related trauma response within limbic system prefrontal cortex . Recently , real-time fMRI ( rt fMRI ) use train subject modulate activity within deep brain region , . Some study even show subject trained regulate activity within network region include mPFC limbic region , result positive effect patient suffer chronic pain depression . Moreover , also find via real-time fMRI feedback subject trained regulate activity within network link emotional regulation ; skill critical dealing traumatic event . The major disadvantage method fMRI test expensive inconvenient patient , MRI machine require method stationary easily accessible . To combine advantage method investigator perform simultaneous test EEG fMRI . Using special algorithm , high reliability , investigator study electrical signal represent activity relate emotional regulation within deep brain region . This combination allow significant improvement spatial resolution EEG device add significant temporal information take fMRI signal . The combined recording EEG fMRI advance computational method , cross correlation machine learning , provide significant improvement attribution EEG signal localization , could achieve adequate reliability . In word , EEG pattern activity reliably represent activation deep limbic region provide `` electrical fingerprint '' ( EFP ) area . Accordingly , investigator develop innovative treatment protocol subject ask control either visual auditory stimulus , determine feedback brain , base extent EFP . In pilot study group civilians investigator show subject successfully learn modify electrical brain signal base EFP . In additional study , simultaneous recording EEG fMRI show success indeed related change activity within deep brain region involve emotional regulation ; mPFC hippocampus . Furthermore , result indicate follow training volitionally regulate EFP via EEG-NF , participant exhibit improved emotion regulation . Rationale current study : Based EFP model NF literature treatment PTSD study aim examine efficiency fMRI-guided-EEG-protocol self-regulation NF reduce stress vulnerability . The study assign two group : experimental group : EFP neurofeedback control group : Sham neurofeedback In order ass efficiency NF protocol preventative intervention PTSD , investigator plan compare treatment outcome placebo sham protocol . Primary objective : Examine efficiency NF reduce stress vulnerability . Secondary objective : Examine efficiency amygdala target Neurofeedback ( NF ) reduce stress symptom among individual recently expose traumatic event . . Study design : Randomized parallel design , 2 group : EFP-NF ( n=35 ) , Sham-NF ( n=35 ) Participant selection : The study involve 40 participant PTSD symptom age 18-40 , divide randomly 2 group ( experimental group , control group ) . Number participant : The study involve 70 individual . Recruitment process : Participants recruit ER trauma clinic TASMC . The hospital provide research team daily list individual arrive ER past 24 hour , screen possible trauma related incident . Our team contact potential subject phone request inform consent conduct phone interview ass presence acute stress symptom . A brief description study provide . If individual agree find suitable participation invite trauma clinic TASMC train clinical psychologist conduct comprehensive PTSD evaluation . The trauma clinic TASMC also refer suitable patient within database participation study . All subject refer trauma clinic undergo identical procedure obtain informed consent subsequent clinical evaluation describe . Intervention arm : The study include 2 group . The experimental group receive EEG-NF session target amygdalae control group Sham-NF . Brain area/s interest : The region interest include limbic system specifically Amygdala , hippocampus ventral striatum , well cortical area associate emotional regulation ( dorso-lateral PFC dorso ventro-medial PFC cingulated cortex insula ) . Study procedure : Pre treatment phase Day 1 Participants undergo psychiatric evaluation ( use SCID ) , medication monitoring . Participants also ask fill demographic psychological questionnaire assess emotion regulation ability ( ERQ ) , state anxiety trait ( STAI ) , questionnaires measure symptom stress , anxiety depression ( CAPS , PCL , BDI ) . Day 2 All Participants undergo brain-imaging scan characterize brain network response associate emotional arousal regulation . Participants scan functional structural MRI include ROI localizer NF , rest state , emotional conflict task , facial recognition task reward task DTI . The research staff explain course MRI test participant , enter subject mock simulator verify lie back properly feels comfortable . During test patient present visual auditory stimulus , well short video clip . Auditory presentation : stimuli heard via MRI-compatible headphone . Visual display : subject view stimuli mirror project onto screen magnet room . In session patient give time rest . Participants ask avoid move much possible scan . The total duration testing , subject arrival departure , take approximately 90-180 minute ( 20-30 minute fill form undergo training , 30 minute explanation break , 60 minute image ) . Participants remain MRI 60 minute , circumstance remain longer 90 minute . Training phase The duration training phase 4 week . At point participant randomly assign either EFP-NF T/A-NF group . Both EFP-NF T/A-NF group receive 1-2 session per week total 6 session . During training session , participant train develop skill regulate brain activity use auditory visual feedback . Each session last hour , include EEG Cap placement fill state questionnaire . The participant seat comfortably front computer screen . A staff member explain goal meeting participant , introduce equipment use , describe course meeting . Following explanation , staff member place EEG cap participant 's head ensure participant feel comfortable . The EEG - Neurofeedback practice consist five-minute segment repeat 30 minute . During practice segment participant ask modify visual auditory medium provide feedback degree successful brain training . For example , visual feedback participant ask low speed skateboard present computer screen alternatively , auditory feedback reduce level music audible headphone place ear . After every two practice segment , duration practice increase two first step short ( 5 minute ) last two long ( 10 minute ) ; total six step every trial total approximately 45 minute Post treatment phase This phase take place 3-5 day end train phase . Day 1 - Participants undergo second psychological evaluation ( CAPS ) . - Participants complete questionnaire pre treatment phase ( BDI , ERQ , STAI , PCL ) . Day 2 • All Participants scan functional structural MRI include ROI localizer , rest state , DTI . Follow-up phase Day 1-5 • All participant receive 2 maintenance session ( EFP-NF T/A-NF ) Day 6 - Participants undergo third psychological evaluation ( CAPS ) . - Participants complete questionnaire previous phase ( BDI , ERQ , STAI , PCL ) . Data collection : Researchers assist participant fill electronic questionnaire conduct non electronic one ( would later transcribe excel sheet research assistant ) .
