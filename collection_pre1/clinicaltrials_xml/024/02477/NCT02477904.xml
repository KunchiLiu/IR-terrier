	<brief_summary>This study ass effectiveness ketogenic diet ( high-fat , low-carbohydrate , moderate protein ) treat autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Three study group comprise child ( 2-21 year age ) base whether ASD receive ketogenic diet - ASD/ketogenic diet , ASD/non-ketogenic diet , non-ASD/non-ketogenic diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study show ketogenic diet ( high-fat , low-carbohydrate , moderate protein ; induce shift primary metabolism glucose ketone ) Modified-Atkins diet may effective treat autism . Research Black Tan BRachyury ( BTBR ) T+tf/J mouse strain , characterize autism-like behavioral phenotype , demonstrate efficacy ketogenic diet improve autism . Although , modify diet , Feingold diet , low-sugar diet , gluten-free diet , show behavioral improvement patient Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , ketogenic diet study autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) despite high incidence ADHD comorbidity . The finding one prospective , pilot study publish , report significant behavioral improvement 18 autistic subject six month ( assess interval four week diet two week diet-free ) ketogenic diet . Clearly , ketogenic modify diet promise treatment ASD understudy . Additional clinical research necessary establish ketogenic diet safe , effective treatment alternative child ASD . This propose research project involve ethnically diverse sample ( varied genetic background environmental exposure ) ass efficacy ketogenic diet therapeutic intervention , understand beneficial effect child ASD . The investigator anticipate noteworthy finding contribute sparse literature ASD effective dietary intervention prompt future research collaboration investigator medical center and/or academic institution . Funding future research appear promise consider ketogenic therapy also novel method treatment variety disorder , include neurodevelopmental disorder , diabetes , migraine headache , brain tumor , multiple sclerosis , obesity . In addition , investigator propose also examine potential change blood composition intestinal ( gut ) microbiome child ( without ) ASD treat ( treat ) ketogenic diet light effect ASD symptomatology . The relationship gastrointestinal tract central nervous system garner increase interest research community . The gut-brain interface describe bidirectional relationship central nervous system influence gut vice versa . Little known mechanism behind anecdotal report dietary success human , suspect alteration gut microflora involve . Mulle et al . ( 2013 ) postulate connection gut microbiome ASD may either direct cause indirect consequence atypical pattern feed nutrition . Similarly , diet pattern , include ketogenic diet , impact nutrient availability thus indirectly modulate gut microbiome . Multiple study confirm difference level gut commensal overall metabolite profile fecal urinary sample healthy child compare child ASD , potentially result change microbiome . In maternal immune activation mouse model ASD , Hsiao et al . ( 2013 ) report probiotic treatment B. fragilis could correct behavioral abnormality metabolomics profile typify ASD ameliorate ASD-relevant GI barrier deficit mouse . Sandler et al . ( 2000 ) demonstrate oral vancomycin treatment show short-term improvement child regressive-onset autism , suggest alteration gut bacteria profile , case antibiotic therapy , may improve autistic behavior . Studies gut microbiome child ASD may elucidate role diet alteration gastrointestinal microbe relate ASD . As result data , novel treatment may discover . The specific aim study : Aim 1 . To evaluate effect ketogenic diet core symptom autism . The following instrument use measure core autistic symptom : ) Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition ( ADOS-2 ) ; b ) Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale ( ASDS ) ; c ) Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS-2 ) ; ) Gilliam Autism Rating Scale ( GARS-3 ) ; e ) Social Responsiveness Scale - Second Edition ( SRS-2 ) ; f ) Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV Text Revision ( DSM-IV-TR ) DSM-V ASD criterion ; g ) Standardized social &amp; intelligence test ( available , administer child 's school ) ; h ) Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale Forms ( Vanderbilt ) . Hypothesis : Participants ASD/on ketogenic diet significantly lessen core autistic symptom ASD/not ketogenic diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . Aim 2 . In anticipation significant change core autistic symptomatology , examine effect ketogenic diet ( ) number dosage medication use behavioral management , ( b ) number lab test order behavioral management , ( c ) number emergency room hospital visit behavioral management , ( ) subject/family satisfaction ketogenic diet . Hypothesis : The number ( and/or dosage ) medication , lab test order , emergency room hospital visit behavioral management decrease , participant/family satisfaction high participant ASD/on ketogenic diet ASD/not ketogenic diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . Aim 3 . To compare difference and/or change ( ) biochemical profile define blood stool ( gut fecal microbiome ) specimen sample ( b ) serum urine ketone level . Hypothesis : Participants ASD/on ketogenic diet notably different biochemical profile significantly high serum/urine ketone level ASD/not ketogenic diet typically develop control regular diet , baseline three six month dietary intervention initiate . The investigator anticipate KD effective treating ASD , understand dietary pattern gastrointestinal alteration ASD . Noteworthy finding contribute sparse literature association dietary intervention neurodevelopmental disorder , assist obtain future fund higher-level clinical trial involve collaborative research medical center academic institution . These initiative , investigator believe , necessary establish KD novel , safe alternative effectively treat patient ASD .</detailed_description>
