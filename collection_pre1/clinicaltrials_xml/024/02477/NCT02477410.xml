	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain good understanding hydrolyse porcine protein affect human metabolism , include effect muscle protein synthesis , appetite secretion gastrointestinal hormone . It hypothesise hydrolysed porcine protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis , affect appetite secretion gastrointestinal hormone similar hydrolyse whey protein .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Hydrolysed Porcine Proteins Muscle Protein Synthesis Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous data show proteins enhance satiety , decrease hunger decrease energy intake . In addition , amino acid dietary protein act build block de novo protein synthesis consumption dietary protein therefore stimulate protein synthesis . Proteins different source differ amino acid composition rate absorption . Previously , study effect protein especially muscle protein synthesis focus milk protein , whey casein animal source , protein source high essential branched-chain amino acid may also beneficial effect muscle protein synthesis appetite . Thus , study effect two hydrolyse porcine protein ( one porcine blood one porcine muscle ) muscle protein synthesis , appetite secretion gastrointestinal hormone compare effect hydrolyse whey protein . These porcine protein never previously test hypothesise may induce similar effect hydrolyse whey protein due high content essential branched-chain amino acid . The study conduct randomise , 3-way , cross-over study . It consist three visit separate least two week . It expect 18 normal-weight , young men complete study . They randomise order three protein ; hydrolyse porcine protein blood ( HPB ) , hydrolyse porcine protein muscle ( HPM ) hydrolyse whey protein ( HW ) . At visit effect muscle protein synthesis , appetite secretion gastrointestinal hormone measured/assessed . Muscle protein synthesis measure consumption low ( 15 g ) high ( 30 g ) dose protein appetite secretion gastrointestinal hormone measure high protein dose ( 30 g ) . The effect muscle protein synthesis measure flood-primed continuous infusion label ( Ring13C6 ) phenylalanine , muscle biopsy blood sample . The effect appetite assess visual analogue scale , ad libitum meal blood sample .</detailed_description>
