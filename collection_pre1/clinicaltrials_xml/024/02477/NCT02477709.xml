	<brief_title>A Study Assess Tolerability Single Dose AF-219 Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess tolerability single dose AF-219 participant idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . This first experience administer AF219 patient IPF . P2X3 receptor find chemosensory afferent carotid body influence sympathetic autonomic discharge , especially sensitized subject ; accordingly , block P2X3 receptor , AF-219 may effect reduce sympathetic activity . Therefore order determine whether P2X3 antagonism would effect hemodynamic measure blood pressure patient IPF , study AF219-019 perform . These patient closely monitor order determine effect .</detailed_description>
