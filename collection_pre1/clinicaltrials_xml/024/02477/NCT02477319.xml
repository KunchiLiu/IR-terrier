	<brief_title>A Two-Part Multicenter Prospective Longitudinal Study CFTR-dependent Disease Profiling Cystic Fibrosis ( PROSPECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disorder cause mutation gene encode cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . Over 1,900 mutation , categorize five genotypic functional class implicate cause CF . Severity disease varies widely CF base CFTR-dependent independent factor . Progressive obstructive lung disease main determinant morbidity mortality CF ; therefore critical identify biomarker profile reflect predict phenotypic variability , understand relationship residual CFTR activity . Emerging CFTR modulator therapy directly target defective CFTR evaluate pivotal clinical trial may become available next year . It know partial restoration CFTR function might impact CF disease progression disease-related biomarkers . Thus urgent need ) identify validate biomarkers might reflect partial restoration CFTR function use monitor disease progression , ii ) evaluate mechanistic effect CFTR modulators relevanttherapies individual CF</detailed_description>
