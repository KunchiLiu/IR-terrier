	<brief_summary>It single-arm , open label clinical trial . Patients affect relapsed refractory small-cell lung cancer patient MGMT promoter methylation include study ; treat oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 die 5 consecutive day every 28 day . Treatment continue tumor progression , intolerable toxicity patient refusal . A Minimax Simon 2-stage design use . - First stage : 9 patient If 1 less response observe , trial ended.- Second stage : 10 patient ( total 19 subject enrol ) If 5 less response observe 19 patient , treatment consider active , 6 response observe , treatment consider sufficiently active warrant testing . Since rate methylation range 20 48 % number patient screen 40 95 . The primary objective determine overall response rate [ ORR = CR + PR ] ; secondary objective determine time Progression ( TTP ) , overall Survival ( OS ) , toxicity correlation response Rate ( RR ) level MGMT promoter methylation and/or base excision repair ( BER ) gene alteration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Patients Affected Relapsed Sensitive Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer With MGMT Methylation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , phase II study . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , limited extensive disease , relapse one two prior chemotherapy regimen MGMT promoter methylation status evaluate histological tissue sample ( patient signature specific inform consent form biological evaluation ) use Pyrosequencing technique main 10 CpG island MGMT promoter study . Only patient MGMT promoter methylation enrol clinical trial . To eligible patient may receive 1 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimen . Patients brain metastasis may enrol . Patients inform palliative nature treatment . Patients treat oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2/die 5 consecutive day . Treatment repeat every 28 day continue disease progression , intolerable toxicity patient refusal . Response chemotherapy monitor every three cycle CT scan chest abdomen compute tomography scan magnetic resonance image whole brain . Response treatment evaluate accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . In case progressive disease ( PD ) patient discontinue treatment . In case stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) patient continue treatment disease progression , intolerable toxicity patient refusal . After end treatment , disease progression occur , patient evaluate every 3 month CT scan chest abdomen CT scan RM whole brain disease progression . Planned follow-up visit continue disease progression patient monitor survival toxicity .</detailed_description>
