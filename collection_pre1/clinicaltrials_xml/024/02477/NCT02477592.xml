	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness two substrate modification approach long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation patient , hypothesize substrate-based , individualized substrate modification ( ISM ) approach superior traditional stepwise ablation ( SA ) . To best investigator 's knowledge , first study evaluate `` real '' substrate mean electro-anatomic mapping perform `` true '' substrate modification long stand persistent atrial fibrillation ablation ( LPAF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Individualized Substrate Modification Approach Treatment Long-standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation ( CA ) highly effective paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , modestly effective long stand persistent atrial fibrillation ablation ( LPAF ) even complex combine approach , mainly attribute substrate underlying AF remodeling . Severity atrial fibrosis closely associated clinical outcome CA AF . The atrial scar fibrosis present , low success rate AF ablation . Patients LPAF many area scar fibrosis paroxysmal AF non-AF control . The MRI delay enhancement technique provide non-interventional tool evaluation atrial fibrosis , however , must perform sinus rhythm.Three-dimensional electro anatomic mapping proven accurate MRI perform easily AF ablation , thus provide good tool evaluation atrial substrate LPAF ablation . Although electro-anatomic mapping provide desirable surrogate delay enhancement MRI define AF substrate , important technical issue consider . There good technique predict desirable tip-tissue contact contact force catheter apply . A poor tip-tissue contact could render result voltage map less reliable . On hand , excessively high contact force could increase risk steam pop cardiac perforation ablation . Hence important use contact force catheter perform substrate mapping ablation .</detailed_description>
