	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participant voluntarily agree participate clinical trial registration , investigator conduct screen test evaluate participant 's suitability . A participant satisfies inclusion exclusion criterion assign test group ( 2-time injection group ) . Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 day bone marrow aspiration , re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cell within 30 day first injection . Participants make total 5 hospital visit registration , Safety Efficacy evaluate base fixed procedure every visit .</detailed_description>
