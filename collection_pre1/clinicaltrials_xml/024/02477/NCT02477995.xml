	<detailed_description>Pertussis , diphtheria tetanus seriously infectious disease child . The world health organization ( WHO ) include adsorption diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis ( DTwP ) expand program immunization ( EPI ) , basic immunization . Since use DTwP , greatly reduce incidence three kind disease . Thousands child save since application . Although DTwP productively pertussis , diphtheria tetanus , thallus pertussis vaccine could cause side reaction vaccination . Many individual want vaccinate . However , two large epidemic pertussis period 1977-1979 1981-1983 . Since 2000 , basic immunization DTwP vaccine replace adsorption tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine ( DTaP ) vaccine American . In 1995 , DTaP successful develop investigator ' country , use EPI present . Because effective immunity cause little side reaction , DTaP widely recognize accepted parent . This clinical trial planning evaluate immunogenicity safety DTaP 3-5 month infant .</detailed_description>
