	<detailed_description>Overactive Bladder Syndrome The International Continence Society ( ICS ) define Overactive Bladder syndrome ( OAB ) medical condition symptom urgency , without incontinence , usually frequency nocturia , proven infection obvious pathology . OAB overall prevalence Western Europe United States 16 % 17 % . Epidemiological evidence indicate symptom OAB common likely affect 50-100 million person worldwide . In EPIC study conduct 5 country &gt; 19000 men woman age &gt; 18 year , use ICS definition OAB , prevalence OAB 10.8 % men 12.8 % woman , prevalence increase age . The prevalence woman storage 59.2 % , void 19.5 % post micturition symptom 14.2 % . The fundamental symptom urgency , widely consider driver urological symptom . Urgency sudden compelling desire pas urine , difficult defer . The urological symptom considerable negative impact quality life , typically result embarrassment loss dignity , might affect relationship , intimacy self-image . Conventional urodynamic test Diagnostic test low urinary tract function perform urodynamic investigation currently widely accept . The aim clinical urodynamics produce symptom whilst make precise measurement order identify underlying cause symptom quantify related pathophysiological process . Urodynamics allow direct assessment low urinary tract function measurement physiological parameter ( e.g . void pressure parameter ; minimal urethral opening detrusor pressure urethral resistance factor ) , micturition volume leakage volume ) . Urodynamics perform automate protocol due current limitation urodynamic equipment lack consensus precise method measurement , signal processing , quantification , documentation interpretation . The Good Urodynamic Practices develop ICS provide guideline regard strategy urodynamic measurement , equipment set configuration , signal testing , plausibility control , pattern recognition , artefact correction . During cystometry , involuntary detrusor contraction find 40 % 60 % patient OAB symptom . Detrusor overactivity contraction occur either filling end . Conventional urodynamic remains gold standard investigate low urinary tract dysfunction . Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI image modality recently develop study different part human body blood flow change . In close collaboration Maastricht University , Scannexus make multiple 7 Tesla MRI scan available study order gain insight brain function area . Bladder Sensations Most understanding experience bladder sensation fill normal individual base upon work Wyndaele De Wachter . The sensation score system develop seek determine underlying reason individual patient usually void meant serve index urgency severity . The 4-point scoring scale range void convenience ( urgency=0 ) desperate urgency score=3 ) capture perception urgency continuum rather per se . The condition recognise clinically 'Overactive Bladder ( OAB ) Symptom Complex ' . It associate increased sensation void result increase voiding frequency , determine void diary . OAB characterise cystometric investigation occurrence involuntary contraction bladder fill phase , typically 'full bladder ' strong sensation describe 'urgency ' ( strong compelling desire void defer intense normal urge void ) . Overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) associate episodic increase bladder sensation void , result increase voiding frequency . During cystometric investigation , OAB also characterise occurrence involuntary bladder contraction fill phase typically full bladder , strong sensation describe urgency ( describe strong compelling desire void defer intense normal urge void ) . It urgency episode leakage ( urgency incontinence ) sometimes occur . In 46 % patient sensation urgency , associate bladder contraction . Many study investigate link patient report sensation bladder property use standard rapid fill cystometry . This lead concept bladder sensation episodic . These episodic sensation supposedly great patient OAB occur low bladder volume , thus generate sensation urgency frequent voiding . As described literature sensation associate bladder fill different imminent voiding . The sensation fill associate generalised feel low abdomen intense sensation imminent pre-void locate deep urethra . This anatomical variation may reflect different sensation different underlying mechanism . This support two system generate sensation : 'continuous sensation ' associate early filling phase intense phasic sensation associate urethra . An alternative view bladder sensation formulate many year ago . It propose information bladder generate continuously awareness bladder volume available entire filling phase . This support neuro-physiological data demonstrate almost continuous afferent outflow bladder receptor bladder fill . As conclusion physiological base sensation `` urge '' `` urgency '' still unknown . Moreover , patient OAB without detrusor overactivity ( DO ) urodynamics common sense urgency . This sense describe sudden , compelling desire void , postpone . Affected individual fear loose urine ( incontinence ) even actually . It still know brain area involve normal desire void control , OAB patient without DO feel urgency . In study would like answer question conduct simple urodynamics fMRI scan patient 's bladder fill normal diuresis sense urgency register push button . In past study conduct fMRI central nervouse system relation bladder control . Poor bladder control report specifically associate inadequate activation orbitofrontal cortex . Clinically , frontal cortical lesion know cause bladder control problems.. In addition , urinary urgency patient OAB show associate increased activation limbic cortex fMRI study woman OAB . A recent study fMRI show significant vast change brain 's functional connectivity bladder fill , suggest central process responsible increase control full bladder state appear largely rely distributed brain system . In study , 3 Tesla fMRI use . The 7 Tesla fMRI intend use study enable u study brain area difficult assess 1,5 3 Tesla . Moreover , none previous study include protocol measure bladder pressure , bladder sensation fMRI scan brain simultaneously .</detailed_description>
