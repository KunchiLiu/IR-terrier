	<detailed_description>Peripheral revascularization surgery usually perform high-risk patient , suffer major comorbidities . Complications associate vascular surgery include coronary problem , arrhythmia , failure revascularization thrombosis . In order prevent complication possible re-interventions essential optimize intraoperative path . Unfractionated heparin commonly use arterial vascular surgery prevent thrombosis accumulation thrombus surgical site . UFH administer clamp blood flow interruption . However , best heparin regimen achieve optimal anticoagulation peripheral revascularization remain unknown , current recommendation base data coronary literature guideline . Few study assess effect vascular clamp blood flow interruption anticoagulation distal vascular bed . Perioperative monitoring coagulation important diagnose potential cause hemorrhage guide hemostatic therapy . Routine laboratory-based coagulation test prothrombin time ( PT ) , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) platelet count use assess patient 's coagulation status . However , value test question acute perioperative setting follow reason : substantial delay blood sample result , test perform plasma rather whole blood lack information platelet function . The activated clotting time ( ACT ) use monitor anticoagulation , indirectly , concentration UFH . The ACT measure whole blood cuvettes contain high concentration activator , typically celite kaolin . Modern method completely automate . ACT measurement point-of-care device use procedure require anticoagulation , cardiopulmonary bypass , interventional cardiology hemodialysis . In vascular surgery , target ACT clearly define therefore systematically monitor . Thromboelastography ( TEG ) bedside coagulation test enable evaluation component hemostasis . An advantage TEG conventional test hemostasis perform whole blood , take consideration role interact blood element . The TEG also adapt different clinical situation . Activators tissue factor , celite thrombin add whole blood accelerate analysis . TEG cup coat heparinase also use degrade heparin without affect coagulation parameter . Ankle-brachial ( ABI ) toe-brachial ( TBI ) index currently use evaluate patient peripheral arterial disease . These non-invasive test provide information peripheral blood flow . The ankle-brachial index ratio systolic blood pressure ankle measure brachial artery . The diagnostic limit ABI confirm several large-scale study . Conditions associate medial calcification , diabetes , chronic kidney disease advance age , lead false result due vessel stiffness . The toe vessel less susceptible vessel stiffness , make TBI useful . Methods : Monitoring postoperative analgesia leave discretion attend anesthesiologist . Surgery perform general regional anesthesia . For safety reason , patient regional anesthesia automatically assign receive fix dose heparin . UFH administer 2 minute prior vascular clamp accord randomization . Blood sample collect follow time point ACT TEG analysis : following induction anesthesia , 30 minute heparin administration , arrival recovery room . Heparin neutralized protamine need . Intraoperative blood loss record . Administration crystalloids , colloid blood product surgery note . Blood sample assess cardiac troponin level collect recovery room day follow surgery . Ankle-brachial toe-brachial index measure preoperatively postoperatively recovery room . The occurrence cardiovascular complication note hospital stay . The incidence vascular re-interventions note 30 day follow surgery .</detailed_description>
