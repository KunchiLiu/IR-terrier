	<detailed_description>Introduction : During last decade , neuropsychiatric impairment adult often observe . Requests neuropsychiatric investigation , especially concern Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) increase . The core ADHD symptom adult include frequent persistent pattern inattention/distractibility and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity ( Adler 2004 ; Adler &amp; Chua 2002 ; McGough &amp; Barkley 2004 ) . In Swedish study , 22 % outpatient general psychiatric care , diagnose ADHD ( Nylander et al 2009 ) . Individuals ADHD also increase risk psychiatric disorder , e.g . major depressive episode , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorder antisocial personality disorder ( Rasmussen &amp; Levander 2009 ; Torgersen , Gjervan &amp; Rasmussen 2006 ) . The co-occurrence ADHD substance use disorder ( SUD ) prevalent phenomenon demonstrate numerous study past decade ( Arias et al 2008 ; Bernardi et al 2012 ; van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen et al 2012 ) . The prevalence substance abuse adult ADHD estimate 50 % among addict seek treatment , one third patient identify probable ADHD , screen instrument use ( Sullivan &amp; Rodnik-Levin 2001 ; Ohlmeier et al 2008 ) . The National Board Health Welfare Sweden note presence people ADHD substance abuse vary 20 % 35 % depend kind drug use ( Socialstyrelsen 2002 ) . Pharmacotherapy , mainly central stimulant medication , consider treatment choice ADHD . In addition , patient request ADHD diagnosis obtain drug treatment ( Harrison , Edwards &amp; Parker 2007 ) . Patients ' expectation influence outcome treatment ( Bingel et al 2011 ) . Linde et al show patient high expectation acupuncture treatment , achieve well treat result patient low expectation treatment ( Linde , Fässler &amp; Meissner 2011 ) . A person 's expectation important part so-called placebo effect . The placebo effect well know clinically important phenomenon patient 's treatment . Extensive research conduct elucidate ( Meissner et al 2011 ; Collocca et al 2013 ; Enck et al 2013 ) . Patients substance syndrome often expectation drug compare patient diagnosis . Some patient often learn deal awkward difficult life situation use drug ( Whalen &amp; Henker 1976 ; Pelham &amp; Lang 1993 ) . This may increase risk person receives low confidence ability solve critical situation without drug . Therefore , important identify patient order give treatment specialize need . This study intend investigate whether patient 's expectation ability solve problem increase take drug . Aim : The purpose study examine effect medication , placebo expectation objective self-rated performance ADHD core sign Quantified Behavior Test patient untreated ADHD substance Use Disorders . This lead follow question ; 1 . Does participant 's self-rated expectation future performance change presence active drug placebo ? 2 . Does participant 's self-rated performance change presence active drug placebo ? 3 . Does participant 's perception exertion change presence active drug placebo ? 4 . Does participant 's performance core sign , Hyperactivity , Inattention Impulsivity QbTest change presence active drug placebo ? 5 . Does participant 's experience tablet 's efficacy change presence active drug placebo ? Method : The study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , cross-over study . The study take place four hour two investigate day , separate 4 day wash-out period . Subjects : Participants 40 consecutive patient remit neuropsychiatric investigation Dependence Clinic Västmanland , Västerås , Sweden . Instruments The Quantized Behavior Test ( QbTest ) include part neuropsychiatric investigation . QbTest measure three core sign ADHD , hyperactivity , inattention impulsivity . The QbTest combine Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) instal software program computer measure attention impulsivity activity test measure motor-activity 20 minute . While perform CPT-test computer , movement participant record use infrared camera follow reflective marker attach head-band . The CPT-test involve rapid presentation figure various shape ( square circle ) color ( red blue ) participant instructed press handheld button stimulus subsequently repeat ( target ) press button stimulus varies relative previous one ( non-target ) . The stimulus present pace one per two second , one visible 200 millisecond , total number stimuli 600 , present 25 % target probability ( Knagenhjelm &amp; Ulberstad 2010 ) . The clinical documentation QbTest extensive . Lis et al demonstrate patient ADHD significantly different variable attention activity control group healthy individual ( Lis et al 2010 ) . Edebol show QbTest sensitivity 83 % specificity 57 % detect ADHD adult ( Edebol et al 2011 ) . The discriminative validity test result show QbTest differ ADHD healthy control , client ADHD clinical group ( Söderström , Pettersson &amp; Nilsson 2014 ; Edebol , Helldin &amp; Norlander 2012 ) . QbTest also show good result objective method monitor drug treatment methylphenidate ( Ginsberg , Hirvikoski &amp; Grann 2012 ; Edebol , Helldin &amp; Norlander 2013 ; Bijlenga &amp; Henker 2014 ) . The Quick Test measure process speed automaticity name shape colour , Cognitive shift visual dimension semantic field Activation work memory process monitoring . AQT 's objective measure base clock total-naming time . Highly reliable ( r = .88 - 96 ) time consistent repeat trial . Procedure : All patient participate two occasion : In one session receive Methylphenidate ( MPH ) condition , session receive placebo condition . MPH placebo condition counterbalance across subject half participant receive MPH first , half participant receive placebo first . Neither participant research assistant aware participant receive MPH condition placebo condition . On investigate day participant accomplish Questionnaires ( Visual Analogical Scales ) concerning ; ( ) expectation , ( b ) self-rated performance , ( c ) exhaust exercise , ( ) perceive help pill ( e ) self-rated symptom . In addition participant complete A Quick Test Cognitive Speed ( AQT ) two separate Quantified Behavior Test Plus ( QbTest ) without medication v MPH/Placebo . Analyses In study , hyperactivity operationalized parameter call `` distance '' , i.e. , length path metre describe movement headband reflector test period . Inattention operationalized basis omission error . An omission error occur response register stimulus Target , i.e . button press . Impulsivity operationalized base commission error . A commission error occur response register stimulus Non-Target , i.e . handheld button press press .</detailed_description>
