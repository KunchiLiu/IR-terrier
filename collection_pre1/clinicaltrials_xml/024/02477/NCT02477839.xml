	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Lacosamide Adjunctive Therapy Subjects â‰¥1 Month &lt; 4 Years With Partial-onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial consist 7-day Baseline Period , 20-day Titration Period , 7-day Maintenance Period , 12-day Transition Period subject complete study choose enter extension study . Subjects enter extension study continue Maintenance Period 16-day Taper Period follow 30-day Safety Follow-Up Period . The Taper Period Safety Follow-Up also applicable subject eligible continuation therefore end study earlier . If subject meet eligibility criterion , randomize receive either Lacosamide 8 mg/kg/day 12 mg/kg/day , placebo Maintenance Phase . The dose Lacosamide titrate 4 mg/kg/day study start maximum 12 mg/kg/day 4-day interval 1-2 mg/kg/day . All subject complete 20-day Titration Period enter 7-day Maintenance Period . No dose adjustment allow Maintenance Phase . The Treatment Phase define combined Titration Maintenance Phases .</detailed_description>
