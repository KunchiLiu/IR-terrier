	<brief_title>Effect Deferiprone Oxidative-Stress Iron-Overload Low Risk Transfusion-Dependent MDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) characterize deficiency blood cell production lead anemia , may necessitate regular transfusion red blood cell ( RBCs ) supportive therapy . While treatment life-saving , since body natural mean remove excess iron introduce intake RBCs , consequence accumulation excess iron , include labile iron , plasma ( labile plasma iron , LPI , pathological form non-transferrin-bound iron ) cell . The cellular labile iron pool ( LIP ) know participate biochemical reaction generate free oxygen radical , result oxidative stress cell tissue damage . A certain percentage patient MDS develop sign symptom result iron overload، oxidative stress marker observe blood cell patient . Progressive iron overload lead organ toxicity cardiac disease . Reduction LIP would reduce generation tissue-damaging free oxygen radical thereby help prevent morbidity mortality ; however , iron chelation therapy part standard care population . It note While LPI level provide momentarily `` snapshot '' iron status rapidly change due nutrition , transfusion chelation , LIP represent long-term accumulation . Both parameter complement analogy hemoglobin A1C glucose measurement patient Diabetes mellitus ) . There exploration use oral iron chelators deferasirox deferiprone MDS patient , indication efficacy assess iron reduction , decrease need transfusion , increase survival . However , difficult draw clear conclusion literature high variability investigation , type chelator study design , severity disease , endpoint study . The safety profile report literature MDS patient similar see thalassemia patient . However , patient later stage disease high risk death AML cause within 5 year , benefit chelation may minimal . What emerge literature progression disease , iron chelation likelier benefit patient less severe form MDS expectation 5 year survival also likelihood long-term RBC transfusion dependency , accompany risk iron overload . 1.2 Deferiprone Deferiprone ( active ingredient 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one ) bidentate iron chelator preferentially bind trivalent iron ( Fe3+ ) 3:1 ( deferiprone : iron ) complex . Its effectiveness treatment patient iron overload assess urinary iron excretion , sequential measurement serum ferritin level , iron concentration liver heart , clinical outcome ability prevent iron-induced cardiac disease prolong survival transfuse patient thalassemia . 1.2.1 Side effect Deferiprone The safety profile deferiprone patient thalassemia extensively characterize clinical trial . Based Summary Product Characteristics , apart chromaturia , due iron excretion harmless , commonly report adverse event see clinical trial nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , increase alanine aminotransferase , arthralgia , neutropenia , define confirm absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) less 1.5×109/L . The significant serious adverse event ( SAE ) associate deferiprone use severe neutropenia , also know agranulocytosis , define confirm ANC less 0.5×109/L . In clinical trial 19 multi-transfused MDS patient treat oral iron chelator deferasirox 3 month , significant decrease free iron specie observe plasma cell , associate amelioration parameter oxidative stress . Another find gradual increase level iron regulatory hormone hepcidin , could also reflect amelioration oxidative stress . However , many MDS patient , particularly old one , unable tolerate treatment deferasirox , mainly due renal and/or gastrointestinal side effect . The proposed clinical trial similar study look safety efficacy deferiprone iron overload , blood dependent MDS patient . 2 STUDY DESIGN This single-arm , open-label , multi-center study 20 patient MDS . All participant treat deferiprone 4 month . Patients blood count monitor weekly , visit site monthly assessment safety efficacy . The schedule study procedure show detail provide Section 5.1 . The daily dosage deferiprone patient maximum dose 100 mg/kg , divide 3 equal dos ( t.i.d . ) 33.3 mg/kg . To minimize gastrointestinal side effect deferiprone recipient experience start treatment , initial dosage total 50 mg/kg/day ( 16.7 mg/kg t.i.d . For patient respond treatment , option continue study drug one year . 3 STUDY POPULATION 3.1 Number Patients A total 20 MDS patient 3.2 Treatment Interruptions Patients advise immediately report symptom indicative infection fever , sore throat , flu-like symptom . If patient develops neutropenia , fever , type infection , Deferiprone must interrupt immediately neutrophil count obtain monitor frequently . 3.3 Concomitant medication In general , concomitant medication therapy deem necessary supportive care safety patient allow . The administration anticancer agent include chemotherapy biologic agent permit . The use concurrent iron chelate agent iron supplement investigational drug allow . The use blood product transfusion erythroid growth factor permit investigator 's discretion . 3.4 Study treatment discontinuation The following event consider reason discontinuation : - Intolerable adverse effect judge investigator detrimental patient . - Participation another investigational drug trial - Loss follow - Patient withdrawal consent 4 STUDY TREATMENTS Deferiprone provide 500 mg film-coated score tablet , take orally 3 time day . It also provide oral solution deferiprone 100mg/ml . The drug take without food , per investigator 's recommendation . 5 MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS 5.1 Efficacy Measurements Primary Objective : • To evaluate effect Deferiprone oxidative stress parameter - Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate effect Deferiprone oxidative stress parameter 1 . Reduced glutathione 2 . Membrane lipid peroxidation 3 . External phosphatidylserine - To evaluate change baseline last visit parameter iron load . 1 . Serum ferritin ( despite ongoing RBC transfusion study period ) . 2 . LIP 3 . LPI 4. serum hepcidin - To evaluate change one month precede baseline visit last month study transfusion requirement . - To monitor safety measure : 1 . Adverse event ( AEs ) . 2 . Number discontinuation due AEs 5.1.1 Oxidative stress parameter Blood sample assessment oxidative stress parameter collect baseline monthly visit . Samples take similar time patient , prior first morning dose Deferiprone . Blood sample collect 2 test tube , 2cc tube . One test tube heparin send day day temperature 40c laboratory Prof. Fibach . Oxidative status ( well LIP ) analyze use flow cytometry technique . Red blood cell ( RBCs ) platelets analyzed test oxidative stress , polymorphonuclear leucocytes analyzed ROS Iron Overload Iron overload evaluate measure serum ferritin , LIP , LPI , serum hepcidin . Blood sample serum ferritin collect baseline , monthly visit , end study . Blood sample assessment LIP , LPI collect baseline monthly visit , send Hadassah University Hospital , Jerusalem ( LIP ) Aferrix Ltd. , Rehovot ( LPI ) , Israel analysis . Two-ml blood sample draw heparin assessment oxidative stress parameter , LIP LPI . For serum hepcidin , 2-ml sample draw without anti-coagulant . All sample keep transported ice , day , Hadassah hospital , Ein-Kerem , Jerusalem . Upon arrival Hadassah , cell , plasma serum , require , separate . Cellular measurement perform day arrival next day . The plasma serum keep frozen assayed LPI serum ferritin , respectively . Serum sample assessment hepcidin level collect baseline monthly visit . All sample send laboratory Dr. Domenico Girelli Verona , Italy , analysis keep end study prof ' Fibach laboratory . 5.1.2 Transfusion Requirements At visit , patient query receipt RBC transfusion last visit : type transfusion , volume ( number transfusion ) blood receive . Details obtain site 's blood bank . . 5.1.3 Laboratory Measurements Samples follow laboratory safety assessment take designated time point throughout study : - Hematology ( weekly ) : hemoglobin , WBC count , ANC , platelet count - Biochemistry ( screen , baseline , monthly visit ) : total protein , GGT , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , sodium , potassium , chloride , glucose , total direct bilirubin , AST , ALT , albumin , blood urea nitrogen , calcium , creatinine , uric acid , alkaline phosphatase , amylase - Serum pregnancy test : screening , baseline , monthly visit</detailed_description>
