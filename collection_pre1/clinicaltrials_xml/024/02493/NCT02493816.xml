	<detailed_description>Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( RDEB ) severe form blister skin disease cause mutation COL7A1 gene . This study aim assess safety intradermal injection gene-modified autologous fibroblast 5-10 adult RDEB . This open-label single-centre phase I study primary objective evaluate adverse serious adverse event 36 month ' follow-up period . Secondary objective include ( 1 ) analysis type VII collagen ( C7 ) expression morphology anchor fibril inject area skin ; ( 2 ) analysis immune response newly express C7 . Each study participant receive three intradermal injection COL7A1 gene-modified autologous fibroblast Day 0 . Each subject undergo initial screen include physical examination assessment disease severity . Blood analyse skin biopsy perform various time point per monitoring schedule 12 month .</detailed_description>
