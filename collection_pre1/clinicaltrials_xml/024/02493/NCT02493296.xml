	<brief_summary>The present study investigate effect artificially stiffen aorta mean aortic stent central aortic haemodynamics ( CAH ) . This study determine whether aortic stenting inadvertently adversely impact CAH , thereby provide rational subsequent therapeutic intervention reduce associate cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Surgery Central Aortic Pressure &amp; haEmodynamics Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased pulse pressure pulse-wave velocity recognize index arterial stiffness ( Laurent , Boutouyrie , Asmar et al. , 2001 ; Qiu , Winblad , Viitanen et al. , 2003 ) . An increased pulse pressure ( indicative increase central aortic pressure ) independently associate increased incidence postoperative neurological cardiac complication ( Fontes , Aronson , Matthew et al. , 2008 ) . Pulse pressure identify independent predictor cerebrovascular event cardiac surgery ( Benjo , Thompson , Fine et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , many study demonstrate pulse-wave velocity independent predictor morbidity mortality range study population ( review see Vlachopoulos , Aznaouridis , Stefanadis , 2010 ) . An increase body evidence suggest brachial artery pressure , although representative , accurate reflection central aortic pressure . The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation study , example , reveal certain drug preferentially reduce central aortic pressure , whilst similar effect brachial artery pressure . Moreover , study central aortic pulse pressure demonstrate independent predictor clinical outcome ( Williams , Lacy , Thom et al. , 2006 ) . Other study support find marker CAP closely related surrogate measure cardiovascular risk leave ventricular mass ( Haider , Larson , Franklin et al. , 2003 ) carotid intima-media thickness ( Kostis , Davis , Cutler et al. , 1997 ) . One inadvertent effect stenting introduction semi rigid conduit circulation . This could potentially increase pulse wave velocity adversely affect central aortic pressure haemodynamics . The investigator thus aim investigate effect aortic aneurysm surgery central aortic pressure haemodynamics</detailed_description>
