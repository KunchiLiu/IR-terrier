	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , inflammatory , neurodegenerative disorder central nervous system , 2.5 million people world . It non-traumatic cause disability young middle-aged adult . Because lesion spread brain , variety symptom . The common symptom typical motor dysfunction . 66 % person MS , even 81 % 15 year , problem movements one upper extremity . Also , 40 untill 70 % person Multiple Sclerosis cognitive impairment . Although less visible , major determine influence social work-related domain . The frequent cognitive dysfunction sustain attention , reduce speed information processing , impaired memory limited executive function . When combination , motor cognitive task , ask , execution task could difficult forego mind . For example problem chat cooking , type report meeting watch television ironing . The dual-task paradigm assume attention divide two simultaneous task . A dual task cost ( DTC ) restriction performance task , compare whit separate task versus simultaneously . Research dual tasking person MS already study extensively , specific upper limb . In 2015 Learmonth , Pilutti Motl publish primary research DTC . They combine movement upper limb cognitive task . The research show difference Persons MS control group . At methodological level , lack randomization task . That important bias learn effect task . They use one task upper limb ; n't enough generalize concept motor interference Persons MS . The study two research question : - Have Persons MS great DTC compare healthy control group ? The motor task execute upper limb . - Is difference DTC person MS depend motor task ? This research observational case-control study individual MS compare healthy control group . They two moment assessment . On first day general performance person measure , use clinical evaluation test questionnaire . On second day test dual task , specific comparison single versus simultaneously perform task .</brief_summary>
