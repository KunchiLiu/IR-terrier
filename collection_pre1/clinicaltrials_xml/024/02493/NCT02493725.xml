	<brief_summary>Guillain-Barré syndrome ( GBS ) immune-mediated polyneuropathy usually follow antecedent infection cause acute neuromuscular paralysis . GBS currently classify two major subtypes : classical demyelinating type axonal variant type . Whereas Europe North America demyelinate GBS major subtype , East Asia Central South America , axonal GBS find 30~65 % patient . Although pathophysiology GBS fully understand , major advance make understanding pathophysiology particularly axonal form GBS . It establish axonal GBS cause molecular mimicry human gangliosides Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides . Autoantibodies bind GM1 GD1a node Ranvier , activate complement , disrupt sodium channel cluster axo-glial junction , result nerve conduction failure muscle weakness . C. jejuni infection induces production antibody , cross-react gangliosides human nerve axolemma , activate complement , result formation membrane attack complex ( MAC ) . The pathology lead axonal degeneration . The standard treatment GBS plasma exchange intravenous immunoglobulin disease progression reach nadir within 4 week . However , acute phase , 18-28 % patient require artificial ventilation 4.1-6.3 % patient die complication . Recovery take several month year , 16.7-19.7 % patient still require aid walk one year onset . Because serious disability GBS patient , alternative novel therapy prevent death acute phase severe sequela need . Eculizumab humanize monoclonal antibody murine anti-human C5 antibody specifically bind final activation complement component C5 inhibit MAC formation suppress cleavage reaction C5 C5a C5b . The efficacy eculizumab GBS show model axonal GBS . At present , animal model demyelinate GBS . However , autopsy study show C3d C5b-9 ( MAC ) deposit Schwan cell , therefore eculizumab effective also demyelinate GBS . This clinical trial conduct investigate efficacy safety eculizumab GBS warrant future global clinical trial . Moreover , also study relationship efficacy clinical subtypes GBS , axonal demyelinating form . Our trial provide insight whether future global developmental plan target whole spectrum GBS world-wide focusing Asia South America .</brief_summary>
