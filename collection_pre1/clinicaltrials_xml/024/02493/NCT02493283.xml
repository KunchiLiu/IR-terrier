	<detailed_description>Dapsone ( diamino diphenyl sulphone , DDS ) synthesize Emil Fromm Jakob Wittmann Freiburg ( Germany ) 1908 . In 1937 , anti-inflammatory potency dapsone discover experimentally-induced infection mouse . Since 1941 , dapsone ( Promin® ) use great success therapy leprosy . Dapsone mainstay treatment leprosy , one component multidrug regimen advise World Health Organization ( WHO ) . In 1950 , Esteves Brandão confirm efficacy drug patient dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring . Sneddon Wilkinson England report remission cause dapsone patient subcorneal pustulosis . The efficacy dapsone treatment pemphigus vulgaris initially report Winkelmann Roth 1960 . After oral administration , dapsone almost completely absorbed gastrointestinal tract bioavailability 86 % . Maximum serum concentration 0,63 4,82 mg/l attain within 2-8 hour single dos 50 mg 300 mg. At steady-state , serum concentration fluctuate 3,26 mg/l 1,95 mg/l chronic treatment 100 mg dapsone daily ( s.i.d. ) . Dapsone distribute organ , cross blood-brain barrier placenta detect breast milk . About 20 % dapsone excrete unchanged urine , 70-85 % water-soluble metabolite additionally small amount feces . Dapsone nearly completely metabolize liver activate polymorphic neutrophil ( PMN ) and/or mononuclear cell . The major metabolic pathway liver N-acetylation polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 ( NAT2 ) N-oxidation cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) enzymes . Major metabolite monoacetyl-dapsone ( MADDS ) dapsone hydroxylamine ( DDS-NOH ) . Dapsone undergoes enterohepatic circulation . MADDS subject also significant deacetylation . A constant equilibrium acetylation deacetylation reach within hour oral administration either dapsone MADDS . The acetylation ratio show large interindividual variation , range 0.1 2.0 . These ratio show bimodal distribution pattern . Acetylation rate-determining step overall elimination dapsone . The amount MADDS excrete urine low largely deacetylated dapsone excretion urine . Between slow acetylators ( SA ) rapid acetylators ( RA ) , differences neither dapsone serum concentration pharmacokinetic parameter dapsone . Also , therapeutic response acetylator phenotype . However , excretion MADDS conjugate derivative higher RA . Therefore , dapsone may use determination NAT2 phenotype even though metabolite represent small fraction dose . MADDS highly bind plasma protein ( &gt; 98 % ) , 20-25 time tightly dapsone . Presumably , small fraction unbound MADDS strong binding plasma proteins reason low availability erythrocyte ( erythrocyte/plasma ratio = 0.33 ) . Tight protein binding also reason behind low glomerular filtration rate metabolite ; therefore half-life MADDS approximately 20-25 hour , similar like dapsone . Microsomal N-hydoxylation second major metabolic route dapsone seem associated hematological side effect drug . However , data excretion free conjugate DDS-NOH vary widely literature . No reliable information available excretion hydroxylated MADDS compound . In term efficacy safety dapsone , important generation DDS-NOH , also occur inflamed lesion skin mediate activated PMN . Thus , year , dapsone become first-line drug treatment dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring , Sneddon-Wilkinson-Syndrome bullous autoimmune dermatosis . Most recently find , formation DDS-NOH mainly control CYP2C9 in-vitro. ( Lit . ) Because know CYP2C9 gene polymorphism ( 4-6 % poor metabolizers , PM ) , efficacy drug bullous autoimmune dermatosis may dependent metabolizer status patient . The investigator hypothesize , subject slow acetylators NAT2 ( SA ) extensive metabolizers CYP2C9 ( EM ) may form significantly high level active metabolite DDS-NOH rapid acetylators NAT2 ( RA ) PM CYP2C9 ( PM ) .</detailed_description>
