	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) well-established treatment patient severe systolic heart failure ( HF ) ventricular desynchronization . Despite consistently observe structural functional improvement well reduction HF event mortality large multicenter randomize trial , 30 % patient remain classified nonresponders . Present evidence show QRS duration effective parameter predict responsivity CRT patient severe HF . But study show QRS duration could influence obesity gender . Accordingly , simple QRS interval width body surface electrocardiograph satisfactory parameter screen patient suitable CRT . Recent study show leave ventricular electrical delay , measure time onset QRS LV electrogram peak ( QLV ) , predict CRT response . At long QLV interval , atrioventricular optimization ( AVO ) increase likelihood structural response CRT . However , unclear whether suitable Chinese patient . The investigator would like validate relation Chinese population explore correct QLV might better predict responsivity CRT .</brief_summary>
