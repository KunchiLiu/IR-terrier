	<brief_summary>The aim research investigate impact dietary advice progression tooth wear 6 month use randomised clinical trial design . Participants severe tooth wear recruit . Half patient receive detailed dietary advice half receive standard care dietary advice . Moulds make mouth original appointment 6 month later . These mould scan superimposed see difference level tooth wear</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Dietary Advice Progression Tooth Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sample size 60 patient recruit separately epidemiology study write informed consent obtain . Patients present moderate severe tooth wear recruit . Those Basic Erosive Wear Examination ( BEWE ) cumulative score great equal 8 least one score 3 occlusal surface low molar incisal edge upper central incisor . After randomisation , impression take upper low teeth use silicone material . One group receive one-to-one dietary advice ( dietary information sheet ) intervention group receive intervention . The silicone impression repeat 6 month later . Impressions cast stone occlusal surface upper low molar buccal surface upper central lateral incisor scan monitor tooth wear progression . The two scan involve teeth superimpose level tooth wear time calculate . The investigator aim see give detailed dietary advice result less erosive tooth wear .</detailed_description>
