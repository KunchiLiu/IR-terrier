	<detailed_description>Preliminary evidence suggest patient lung cancer experience decrease exercise tolerance muscle strength course treatment . The underlying mechanisms impact change yet investigate . In light , trial prospectively follow convenience sample 70 patient lung cancer treat curatively . Patients assess , end treatment ( surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy ) . The aim study 1 . Investigate influence curative treatment lung cancer functional maximal exercise tolerance ( primary outcome ) . 2 . Investigate metabolic change underlie change exercise tolerance curative treatment lung cancer ( primary outcome ) . 3 .
