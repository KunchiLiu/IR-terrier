	<brief_summary>Introduction : The effect Low Level Laser Therapy ( LLLT ) exercise-induced muscular damage study last year . Studies conduct animal human order try show benefit intervention , still conflict evidence protective therapeutic effect . Objectives : To describe effect LLLT pain , strength muscular inflammation plyometric exercise . Methods : A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial participation 20 male healthy volunteer perform . Healthy physically active individual , age 18 35 year , history injury low limbs contra-indications maximal exercise performance include . A protocol 10 series 10 repetition countermovement jump use induce muscle damage low limb . Immediately exercise protocol , LLLT apply one low limb , receive placebo treatment . Phototherapy apply equipment 810nm cluster 5 diode 8 different point knee extensor muscle , totalize dosage 240J . The placebo treatment hold way , equipment turn . The volunteer evaluate baseline ( exercise protocol ) follow-up 24 , 48 72 hour . The following outcome evaluate : knee extensor isometric peak torque Isokinetic Dynamometer , pain Visual Analogue Scale muscular tissue echo intensity Ultrasonography .</brief_summary>
