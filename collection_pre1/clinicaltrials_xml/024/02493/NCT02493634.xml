	<brief_title>Post-market Clinical Follow-up Study With Magnetic Resonance Imaging Conditional Guide Wire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This post-market clinical follow-up study 25 consecutive patient two center evaluate safety guide wire conditional use magnetic resonance image acceptability identify risk clinical evaluation detect emerge risk basis factorial evidence . The guidewire used access patient central circulatory system particular introduction exact placement pressure catheter measure pressure gradient aortic arch . The procedure do patient clinical indication cardiac magnetic resonance conventional catheterisation.Patients need body weight 40 kg introduction 5 French catheter possible . The primary endpoint measurement procedural success , define successful insertion , steerability visibility MRI , absence device related adverse event damage vessel wall . In addition structural integrity instrument assess .</detailed_description>
