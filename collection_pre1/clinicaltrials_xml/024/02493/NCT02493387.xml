	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common arrhythmia , physical activity exercise sometimes avoid due symptom palpitation , fatigue anxiety . Physiotherapist-led group base exercise part cardiac rehabilitation rare group patient , method physical activity prescription use encourage patient increase physical activity level order reduce risk premature morbidity mortality . However , mostly method know patient 's ability perform prescribe amount physical activity , effect physical fitness study patient heart disease , neither effect physiotherapist lead group-based exercise patient atrial fibrillation . The aim investigate impact physiotherapy lead group-based exercise compare physical activity prescription patient atrial fibrillation regard level physical fitness , physical activity , heart rate health relate quality life ( HR-QoL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supervised Exercise Compared PAP Patients With Permanent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety consecutive patient age 65-85 year , visit cardiology clinic Alingsås Hospital , Sahlgrenska University Hospital primary care western part Sweden ask participate study . Inclusion criterion permanent atrial fibrillation verify electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) ≥ 45 % significant valvular lesion verify ultrasound . Exclusion criterion : Coronary event angina pectoris within 3 month prior inclusion , stroke residual symptom , presence pacemaker able participate functional test due disability , read Swedish . Physical fitness measure symptom limited bicycle test muscle endurance test . Physical activity measure accelerometer International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) , HR-QoL measure Short form ( SF-36 ) . After test return accelerometer patient randomize either physiotherapist lead group-based exercise motivate interview physical activity prescription ( PAP ) . The group-based exercise program consist 60-minute session twice week 3 month , include central circulatory exercise perform ergometer cycle muscle training , two occasion home-based exercise . The exercise program design patient requirement intensity 13-17 Borg RPE 6-20 scale . The patient randomize PAP receive PAP prescription physical activity diary . The PAP physical activity diary follow 6 12 week inclusion . After three month patient perform test baseline . A write informed consent obtain patient .</detailed_description>
