	<criteria>Subject active acromegaly define elevated GH IGF1 level ( measure central laboratory ) outline : A serum level IGF1 ≥1.3 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) screen period ( applicable treatment naïve subject subject stop treatment undergone washout period prior Visit 1 ( Week 4 ) . Subjects must mean serum GH concentration ≥2.5 μg/L GH cycle ( 5 sample take 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute ) screen period . The subject undergone surgical removal adenoma acromegaly least 3 month prior Screening , likely require pituitary surgery future complete least 32 week study treatment plus additional follow 8 week subject take part pharmacokinetics ( PK ) extension , pituitary surgery option ( due contraindication , refusal etc . ) therefore never likely undergo pituitary surgery . The subject treat radiotherapy within 10 year prior Screening . The subject treat lanreotide Autogel , lanreotide PR , pegvisomant , cabergoline octreotide LAR within 3 month Screening octreotide immediate release ( IR ) bromocriptin within 2 week Screening . The subject history currently present clinically significant ventricular atrial dysrhythmias ≥Grade 2 , use National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) v4.0 . The subject uncontrolled diabetes ( glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 8.5 % ) .</criteria>
