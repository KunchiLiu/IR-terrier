	<brief_summary>The study seek understand effective use novel Microwave Radar Breast Imaging System Symptomatic Breast Care Clinic . The MARIA Imaging system use low level non -- ionise radiation ( radio wave ) signal scan breast tissue volume provide visual image area vary tissue permittivity value within volume . These area vary permittivity show two three dimensional image use conjunction X-Ray mammogram ultrasound scan provide another level diagnosis radiologist.The system work equally well dense lucent breast type particular provide insight diagnosis dense tissue case . The trial accept symptomatic case suspect cancer , cysts fibroadenoma . The trial use image produce MARIA system compare image obtain use X-Ray mammography . The result comparison assessed understand effectiveness MARIA image assist identification location suspect lesion specific analysis use Ultrasound/Biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A potential participant ask breast care clinician would interest participate new form breast scan trialÍ¾ agree consider give patient information sheet brief explanation . After initial consultation either whilst wait , mammogram , approach researcher ( healthcare professional ) ask would like take part . Equipment show procedure explain , agreement require sign four copy consent form . The patient ask remove top clothing lie prone specifically design couch allow one breast sit ceramic cup contain small amount contact liquid . The cup position adjust get best fit test short trial scan take second . Once satisfactory subject ask keep still possible 25 second scan . The radiowave array rotate degree scan repeat four time . The scanning procedure take 3 5 minute total , question , consent , explanation dress total visit time 20 25 minute . The patient return breast care clinic continue investigation management . Personal detail collect time subject 's age , menopausal status breast ( bra ) size . Details retrieved hospital record system later fully anonymised mammogram , ultrasound scan cytology/histology report available . No intervention need .</detailed_description>
