	<brief_summary>This multi-center , Phase II , open label , single-arm trial intratumoral pIL-12 EP combination pembrolizumab patient low TIL melanoma . Patients initiate treatment pembrolizumab concurrently first cycle intratumoral pIL-12 EP . Pembrolizumab administer 200 mg flat dose every 3 week . Cycles intratumoral pIL-12 EP ( cycle consist treatment day 1 , 5 8 ) occur every 6 week long patient accessible lesion EP . Patients evaluate response every 12 week RECIST v1.1 . Patients continue therapy stable disease well , define investigator evaluation time disease evaluation . Therapy give disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The exception patient experience confirm CR treatment least 6 month ; patient may discontinue treatment investigator 's discretion . Patients may reinitiate either therapy post-complete remission relapse study remain open patient meet condition outline protocol . Patients follow continually safety tolerability assessment adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological diagnosis melanoma progressive locally advanced metastatic disease amenable definitive local therapy curative intent . At least one tumor accessible intratumoral injection EP investigator 's assessment . Patients may prior chemotherapy immunotherapy radiation therapy . All prior therapy must stop 4 week prior first dose study treatment , exception patient receive ipilimumab , must stop 6 week prior first dose study treatment . Patients prohibit receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose study treatment . Age ≥ 18 year Patient agree two newly obtain biopsy tumor ( biopsied investigator 's assessment ) providing acquire tissue biomarker analysis . Analysis central laboratory one fresh biopsy sample must show &lt; 70 % PD1hiCD8+CTLA4+ CD45+ gate base flow cytometry . A second fresh biopsy sample require , eligibility purpose , biomarker analysis confirmation later date low PDL1 expression use Merck 's PDL1 IHC assay ( clone 22C33 ) . Archival tissue biopsy obtain purpose ( i.e . protocol procedure ) may use low PDL1 expression confirmation give : tissue must previously irradiate ; systemic antineoplastic therapy receive patient time biopsy first administration study treatment . Even archival tissue collect , two newly obtain biopsy still require baseline . Life expectancy least 6 month . ECOG performance status 01 . Adequate organ function within 4 week administration study therapy . Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) &lt; 4 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Adequate hematological function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Adequate hepatic function : Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN patient total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 x ULN OR ≤5 x ULN patient liver metastasis Adequate renal function : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Coagulation : International normalized ration ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 x ULN ( Only use anticoagulants* ) Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 x ULN ( Only use anticoagulants* ) If patient receiving anticoagulant , value must within therapeutic range condition patient treat . Female patient childbearing potential negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day administration study therapy . The effect pIL12 EP pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential ( free menses &gt; 2 year , post hysterectomy/oophorectomy , surgically sterilize ) men must agree use adequate contraception : 2 adequate barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method contraception prevent pregnancy abstain heterosexual activity throughout study , start first study treatment 120 day last dose study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception start first dose study drug 120 day last dose study therapy . Ability understand write informed consent document , willingness sign . Patient currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week administration study therapy . Patient expect require form antineoplastic therapy study ; include systemic chemotherapy , biological therapy , immunotherapy specify protocol . Patient uveal melanoma . Patient know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide clinically stable without use systemic steroid least 8 week prior study entry . Patient risk factor bowel obstruction bowel perforation ( example include limited history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , abdominal carcinomatosis ) . Patient previously severe hypersensitivity reaction treatment another mAb . Patient history pneumonitis interstitial lung disease . Patient active infection time study entry require systemic antibiotic and/or oral temperature ≥ 38.3ºC within 5 day first treatment . Patients electronic pacemaker defibrillator exclude study , effect electroporation device unknown . Patient active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Patients vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Patients require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Patients hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement exclude study . Patient medical condition require chronic systemic steroid therapy require form immunosuppressive medication . However , patient use physiologic replacement dose hydrocortisone , equivalent , consider eligible study ; 20 mg hydrocortisone ( 5 mg prednisone ) morning 10 mg hydrocortisone ( 2.5 mg prednisone ) evening . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect upon treatment pIL12 EP + pembrolizumab unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pIL12 EP + pembrolizumab breastfeed discontinue mother treated pIL12 EP + pembrolizumab . Patients symptomatic ascites pleural effusion . A patient clinically stable follow treatment condition eligible .</criteria>
