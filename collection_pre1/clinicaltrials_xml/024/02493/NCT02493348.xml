	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia chronic pain disorder associate widespread pain dramatically impact patient ' quality life . Its exact cause yet identify , however , recent study indicate fibromyalgia associate significant imbalance connectivity within brain network associate pain , decrease functional connectivity descend pain-modulating system , increased activity pain matrix related central sensitization . It suggest treatment stimulate induce coherent neuronal activity , synchronize dysregulated brain circuitry , significant benefit improve pain management enhance patient ' quality life . An example non-invasive treatment think indirectly stimulate neuronal coherence Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation ( RSS ) gamma frequency . RSS stimulate mechanoreceptors body use low-frequency sound ( e.g. , 40 Hz ) mean speaker chair . Previous research demonstrate significantly improve pain management several pain condition ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , low-back pain , sport injury ) ; however , little known effect RSS low-frequency sound fibromyalgia . The use RSS treat fibromyalgia first explore recently finding indicate treatment could effective individual fibromyalgia give 40 Hz low-frequency sound stimulation indirectly stimulate neuronal coherence . The present research aim determine effectiveness RSS 40 Hz sound treat individual fibromyalgia . Aim : The present study aim examine determine effectiveness RSS 40 Hz sound improve pain management quality life among patient fibromyalgia . Intervention : The propose treatment involve 30 minute daily rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation 40 Hz , 5 day per week , 5 week . The treatment self-administered patient home Sound Oasis Vibroacoustic Therapy System ( VTS ) 1000 portable device . Measures pain severity , fibromyalgia symptom , sleep quality , depression compare treatment treatment control group . Outcomes : It expect patient undergo RSS 40 Hz significantly different score treatment outcome measure examine comparison control group . The result present study help well understand effectiveness RSS treatment chronic pain disorder , fibromyalgia , contribute development future study investigate neural driving effect therapy base RSS .</detailed_description>
