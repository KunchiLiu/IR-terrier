	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether individual cardio-respiratory fitness level protect negative metabolic impact prolong sit time . Overall , hypothesised individual high fitness , unfavourable effect prolong sit ( build sugar , fat insulin blood follow meal ) substantial , light activity break advantageous , compare individual low fitness small scope metabolic improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FIT 2 SIT - Are Metabolic Responses Sitting/Light Breaks Mediated Fitness ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FIT 2 SIT study require three separate study visit total . At visit one , check participant blood pressure , height , weight , waist measurement body fat percentage , also take blood sample measure HbA1c cholesterol , help confirm participant eligible continue study ( may exclude base result ) . We also measure amount energy participant expend per minute rest slow walking task ( 3km.h treadmill ) use gas mask technique . Energy response sit walk differ individual , therefore interest observe participant study respond condition may help explain potential finding study . For instance , introduce walk break ( way reduce sit time ) may benefit consequent increase energy expenditure result break . Lastly , mark end first study visit , participant ask perform exercise test base treadmill assess fitness level . whilst run special mask cover nose mouth worn analyse breathing , connect machine ( gas analyser ) give information amount oxygen participant breathe . The point amount oxygen breathe remain stable despite increase exercise difficulty point stop exercise test tell u reach exercise capacity ( call V02max ) , determine fitness level . Following first visit fitness level data participant . Recruiting participant diverse fitness level help elucidate role individual fitness response follow treatment condition . Treatment condition A refer 'sitting ' condition . Here participant remain seat throughout whole 7 ½ hour test period ( 8am - 3:30pm ) whilst watch TV/DVD 's , reading , use internet , paperwork etc . . On arrival , participant cannula ( small tube allow u take blood ) insert arm ; stay arm allow u take regular blood sample throughout day , without need multiple needle . After take first blood sample , participant sit quietly hour . We provide breakfast . Whilst sit , take blood sample ( use cannula ) blood pressure 30 , 60 , 120 180 minute breakfast . We provide lunch meal continue take blood sample blood pressure 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 210 minute lunch meal . In total , take 11 blood sample 7 ½ hour test period . Although may sound lot , equivalent around 8-9 teaspoon blood course day . Condition B 'light activity break ' condition . Participants go exactly process condition A also ask 5 minute bout slow walking treadmill every 30 minute follow breakfast lunch . In total 12 five minute walk treadmill throughout 7 ½ hour test period ( 60 minute walk total ) . In total , take 11 blood sample day . With data participant metabolic response meal A ) prolong sit B ) interrupt sit condition , see fitness influenced result . However , present , absence laboratory randomise crossover trial assess 'extent ' fitness moderate relationship sedentary behaviour metabolic health marker appear absent literature , warrant investigation , design chosen .</detailed_description>
