	<detailed_description>Study IBD98-M-2002 Phase 2a , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study patient active , mild moderate UC . It conduct exploratory proof concept study investigate clinical efficacy IBD98-M delayed-release capsule ( fix combination ) 6-week treatment period 2-week follow-up period . Patients screen study enrollment 4 week prior randomization ( Visit 3 ) . During screen period , patient evaluate conduct laboratory test , physical examination , sigmoidoscopy . To eligible , patient score ≥4 ≤10 UCDAI , score ≥1 UCDAI endoscopy subscore . In addition , diagnosis UC must confirm endoscopic histologic evidence past ; prior confirmation available , must do time screen endoscopy . After screen visit , eligible patient randomize 1 3 study group : ( 1 ) IBD98 M 0.8 g/day ( mesalamine 0.8 g sodium hyaluronate 92 mg ) , ( 2 ) IBD98 M 1.2 g/day ( mesalamine 1.2 g sodium hyaluronate 138 mg ) , ( 3 ) placebo . Up 51 patient enrol study ( include drop-out patient ) , 17 patient randomized treatment group . Patients encourage take medication time every day . During study , patient visit clinic 7 occasion : 2 visit screen period ( second screen visit baseline visit ) ; 4 visit treatment period , Visits 3 , 4 , 5 , 6/early termination Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 ; 1 visit end follow-up period , Visit 7 Week 8 . Patients record dates/times dose ( randomization ) , concomitant medication , symptoms adverse event ( AEs ) daily diary start Visit 1 continue end treatment ( Visit 6/early termination ) . Rescue medication permit 6 week treatment period , patient consider benefit therapy withdrawn assign appropriate alternative UC treatment Investigator .
