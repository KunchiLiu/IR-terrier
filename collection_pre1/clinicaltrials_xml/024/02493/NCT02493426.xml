	<brief_summary>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) group severe , life-long developmental disorder . Oxytocin ( OT ) neurohormone involved repetitive/rigid social behavior . This study focus single dose intranasal OT ( IN-OT ) affect cognitive rigidity social perception task . Taking OT spray nose increase social decrease repetitive behavior adult ASD , explore help child ASD similarly . However , unclear whether every person ASD abnormal OT level , OT affect restrictive social behavior differently . Consequently , aim study whether OT treatment effective treating subgroup specific feature ASD . We use approach utilize behavioral physiological response clarify role OT ASD . We develop deeper understand range social rigid behavior use information identify person ASD would benefit OT treatment . Potential subject ask want participate two session clinical laboratory get either single dose IN-OT placebo . After receive substance , ask handful task monitor heart rate , eye movement , collect baseline post intranasal blood , urine saliva . The level hormone , metabolite peptide related interact OT measure collect sample blood plasma , urine saliva . Additionally DNA extract blood sample study gene relate OT ASD .</brief_summary>
