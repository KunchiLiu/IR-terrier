	<brief_summary>The first major objective pilot trial demonstrate possible study myelin repair relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) patient enhance lesion MRI use advanced imaging technique . To demonstrate possible investigator recruit 24 RRMS patient treat standard disease modify therapy ( DMT ) new lesion identify clinically indicated brain MRI scan measure myelin repair 16 32 week use MRI measure myelin repair . The second major objective determine much repair occur participant treat domperidone compare treat . This allow u design large trial confirm domperidone improve repair . The study also confirm safety tolerability domperidone RRMS , determine circulate prolactin level dose domperidone 10mg three time daily people RRMS , explore impact clinical factor ( age ) lesion repair . In addition , blood collect test metabolomics investigator bank blood future study biomarkers help investigator well understand MS. Metabolomics experimental test change pattern chemical blood cell compare different time point ( inflammation ) . There random change change common study participant may help identify chemical signal stage injury repair . The investigator also compare pattern change best repair bad repair . This may help identify chemical associate well bad repair help develop new treatment strategy . There currently blood test help diagnosis MS , help determine drug person respond , help determine person 's expect MS outcome . Any test would consider biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate investigator recruit DMT treat RRMS patient breakthrough enhance lesion identify clinically indicated monitoring brain MRI scan measure lesion repair 32 week . - To obtain estimate magnitude variability lesion repair DMT treat RRMS patient take add-on domperidone , add-on treatment . The investigator evaluate three MRI measure [ texture analysis , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , magnetization transfer imaging ( MTI ) ] ability measure repair within acute enhance lesion RRMS . They also evaluate repair 16 32 week . These outcome aid development future trial . No therapy yet show improve lesion repair , accept trial model evaluate lesion repair human . Therefore , investigator anticipate data trial inform design future phase 2 trial therapy promote lesion repair MS . Secondary Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability domperidone RRMS - To determine serum prolactin level dose domperidone 10mg tid population - To explore metabolomic profile lesion repair . - To explore impact follow variable lesion repair : prolactin level 6 week , concurrent use type DMT , Vitamin D B12 level baseline , patient clinical characteristic ( MS duration , EDSS ) , image characteristic ( T2 lesion volume , enhance lesion volume ) , patient demographic behaviour ( age , sex , smoke status ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must age 18 60 year . Sexually active men woman childbearing potential , define postmenopausal ( 24 consecutive month ) permanently sterilise , must agree use adequate contraception . Adequate contraception define method birth control result low failure rate [ i.e . le 1 % per year ] use consistently correctly implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , barrier contraceptive , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . Adequate contraception require domperidone treatment one month stop treatment . Participants must MS define accord McDonald criterion ( Polman et al . 2011 ) . Participants must RRMS accord Lublin et al . ( 2014 ) . Participants must treat stable approve dose glatiramer acetate , interferonbeta , fingolimod , dimethyl fumarate , teriflunomide least 6 month . Participants must schedule clinically indicate brain MRI monitor DMT effectiveness . Participants must least one gadolinium enhance lesion DMT monitoring MRI ( screen MRI ) . Participants must report least 80 % adherence current DMT treatment discontinuation one week longer within prior 6 month . Participants must patient Calgary MS Clinic . Participants must provide write informed consent Participants pregnant breastfeed Participants expect current DMT discontinue within 16 week . Indicators likely discontinuation include poor DMT tolerance , wish participant discontinue DMT , history poor clinical response current DMT ( relapse within previous year current DMT ) Participants long QT interval , define correct QT interval 470 msec men 450 msec woman , screen ECG . Participants know longQT syndrome know cardiac arrhythmia . Participants currently previously treat natalizumab . Participants currently treat domperidone take within previous 3 month . Participants take drug prolong QT interval treat drug inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 . Participants concurrently treat drug may increase serum prolactin level . Participants prolactinoma Participants use systemic corticosteroid within 8 week prior screen MRI use concurrent immunosuppressive medication include systemic corticosteroid . Participants history breast cancer breast carcinoma situ clinically significant depression , renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , respiratory , metabolic , ophthalmologic , cerebrovascular , serious physical disease . Participants gastrointestinal stimulation might dangerous , i.e . gastrointestinal hemorrhage mechanical obstruction perforation Participants know allergy intolerability domperidone . Participants serum potassium , sodium , magnesium calcium level outside normal range , serum creatinine &gt; 6 mg/100 ml &gt; 0.6 mmol/l ) , condition situation opinion investigator would either put patient risk worsen health enrol trial would prevent completion trial . Participants concurrently participate therapeutic clinical trial .</criteria>
