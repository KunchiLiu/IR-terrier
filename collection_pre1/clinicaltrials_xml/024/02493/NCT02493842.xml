	<brief_summary>Background : Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) develop 50-80 % subject limb amputate . It well know cause PLP develop current treatment show largely ineffective . Resent research , however , indicate cortical reorganize occur amputation cortex area relate miss limb may relate development PLP . Furthermore , research indicate provide meaningful sensory input come phantom limb PLP may alleviate cortical organization normalize . Aim : The CIP describe current application , part EU-project `` EPIONE '' , aim investigate cortical normalization PLP alleviation induce provide phantom limb sensation ( sensation seem originate miss limb ) hand amputate subject . Method : In current study , take place Aalborg University Hospital ( AUH ) , 2-4 hand amputate subject experience severe PLP implant interneural nerve electrode arm stump one year . Therapy evaluate two stage , first standardize four week phase subject receive daily therapy . If therapy show effective , therapy may reinitiated second long therapy phase . During therapy session , selective nerve stimulation perform . The amputee experience sensation ( movement , touch , temperature , vibration etc . ) originate phantom limb . While implanted , investigate well induce sensation provide stimulation therapy , consist stimulation activity require subject focus evoke sensation . Prior , follow therapy series assessment ( standardize across EPIONE partner enable comparison ) conduct relate therapy PLP , cortical organization , mental state etc . subject . Expected outcome : The stimulation therapy expect alleviate PLP induce cortical normalization . The experience gain might use derive clinical guideline treat PLP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study carry two part . The first part function pilot part investigator seek get experience , e.g. , stimulation procedure : Which therapies activity stimulation parameter participant feel intuitive ( i.e. , effective reintroducing phantom hand body image amputee ) thus might expect effective normalize cortical organization alleviate PLP . After part 1 data analyze together international partner ( participant identifiable data share ) share experience use adjust activity part two . The experiment conduct following phase : 1 . Startup 2 . Pre-screening 3 . Baseline entry 4 . Implantation ( define week 0 ) 5 . Therapy 6 . Outcome 7 . Follow-up 8 . Repetition . Redo phase 3 7 long therapy phase duration Procedures phase 1 7 ( week -5 12 ) standardize across international EPIONE partner ( carry different intervention , similar assessment ) , enable comparison treatment modality . At AUH , therapy show effective phase 1-7 , investigator repeat initial phase 3 7 , long therapy phase , investigate effect long term stimulation therapy . TIME-4H electrodes leave implanted long duration one year . During different phase study collection assessment method conduct monitor effect stimulation therapy amputee 's level perceive PLP cortical organization . In addition , psychological state subject , strength type non-painful phantom limb sensation also assess provide detailed view possible effect stimulation therapy . The experiment conduct series case study effect stimulation therapy participant compare PLP sensation subject perceived initiate therapy . Therefore , amputee stable state ( e.g. , newly amputate subject ) include study . No placebo blind perform participant feel stimulation also mentally active involve perform `` phantom limb movement '' receive stimulation therapy . Phases 1-7 subject ( week -3 week 12 , week = 0 implantation ) perform accord experiment protocol define collaboration international partner . Phase 8 , define AUH , constitute repetition phase 3-7 , treatment phase prolong . Phase 1 : Startup The participant invite meeting principal investigator one senior researcher involve study inform experiment . Only PI , medical doctor , allow answer health medical related question . Phase 2 : Pre-screening This phase conduct start experiment subject sign informed consent form authority form , latter grant representative Danish Health Medicines Agency access study data patient record control purpose . Via questionnaires , test interview evaluate participant fulfills inclusion criterion relation physical health ( able undergo surgery ) , depression , normal range IQ PLP . The principal investigator evaluate result decide whether participant include exclude . Phase : Baseline entry The baseline entry phase aim determine stability intra-subject variability pain sensation without treatment . The measure control daily variability pain , assessment score variability , site-to-site variability inter subject variability `` intervention '' state . These variance use analysis estimate baseline noise measure . A second rationale repetition measure phase trap effect might come run assessment , e.g. , due increase attention PLP . If participant live close AUH , assessment conduct AUH supervision experimenter . If unpractical participant attend daily session AUH , subject may conduct home receive adequate training regular contact experimenter . If perform home , assessment ( questionnaire ) may fill subject printed-out version use laptop Psychophysical Testing Platform instal use participant specific login accompany functional restriction . In addition questionnaire use quantify perceived phantom limb pain sensation , last week implantation include application cortical mapping method ( EEG , SEP fMRI ) . During phase study subject require fill diary go bed development PLP day . Phase 3 : Implantation Surgical implantation TIME-4H electrode conduct full anesthesia . During operation , median ulnar nerve free incision 20 cm medial aspect upper-arm . The fascicles nerve dissect free couple centimeter level TIME-4H electrode implant . Four TIME-4H electrode pull fascicle nerve use attached needle thread , two TIME-4H nerve . The electrode anchor nerve use dedicate anchor point TIME-4H ( see figure 4 ( B ) ) . After place electrodes electrical integrity TIME-4H electrode test , close wound . Lead wire lead skin wound close . During surgery participant treat prophylactic antibiotic . Prophylactic antibiotic administer later study due risk development resistance . After implantation subject offer stay Patienthotellet enable routine assessment surgical outcome long PI judge necessary . Wound treatment While electrode implant , subject routinely wound wire exit arm clean treated reduce risk infection . This conducted nurse member project group . The participant receive training treating/cleaning wound also symptoms aware . During phase study subject attend daily therapy session thus daily face-to-face contact project team , participant may shorter period perform wound treatment him/herself . Phase 5 : Therapy Phantom limb pain sensation assess via questionnaire prior follow stimulation therapy . Several assessment conduct phase purpose characterize sensation evoke provide sensory stimulation therapy aim alleviate phantom limb pain . - PsyP-Map ( B ) : Stimulation conduct use individual contact sit different combination implant TIME-4H purpose ( 1 ) determine suitable ( sensation threshold pain threshold ) stimulation parameter ( intensity , pulse width etc . ) ( 2 ) mapping perceive location type sensation evoke . Will conduct every week ; session last approx . 2 hour . - Stimulation therapy : Stimulation perform aim induce meaningful sensory input subject thereby induce normalization cortical organization alleviation PLP . This seek accomplished performing activity reintroduce miss limb subject 's body image : - The subject instruct imagine perform movement sensation indicate subject computer screen phantom hand . During `` movement '' experimenter seek evoke relevant sensation via electrical stimulation . - The therapy session conduct every weekday ; session last approx . 2 hour . If result indicate therapy effective subject interested continue therapy , TIME-4H electrodes leave implanted outcome follow-up phase . However , stimulation therapy perform phase . An fMRI examination schedule carried end therapy phase . The TIME-4H currently test MR compatibility , result expect March 2015 . If TIME-4H compatible , fMRI examination conduct plan . If compatible , fMRI examination conduct TIME-4H explanted . Phase 6 : Outcome After four week therapy series assessment perform assess effect therapy . No stimulation therapy conduct outcome follow follow-up phase . Phase 7 : Follow-up During follow-up phase assess long time take effect pain alleviate effect therapy wear . The frequency follow-up assessment dependent whether therapy effective individual subject ( entry assessment compare outcome assessment ) . If effective , follow-up assessment conduct one time week , 2 , 4 8 week end therapy . If deem ineffective , follow-up assessment conduct 4 week end therapy ( week 8 ) . At end follow-up phase procedure standardize EPIONE international partner end , partner decide individually proceed . Phase 8 : Repetition therapy At AUH , case apply stimulation therapy reduce PLP subject subject interested continue therapy , therapy may reinitiated repeat procedure phase 3 to7 , however , long therapy period . The study duration subject limit maximum TIME-4H implantation duration , set one year maximum , later study overall termination experimental activity EPIONE study . Recognizing potential long duration study large effect daily therapy session subject 's everyday life , especially subject live far AUH , therapy adjust term frequency ( e.g. , one time weekly ) duration ( hour per session ) suit subject , aim administration enough therapy induce sufficient PLP alleviate effect . Explantation In event infection , blushing , swell , pain complication render continuous implantation impossible , electrode explanted subject treated antibiotic . Explantation TIME-4H electrode may conduct end therapy phase therapy unsuccessful subject wish continue . If subject wish continue therapy , maximal allow implantation time 1 year . Explantation carry full anesthesia . Access obtain via insertion make skin medial side upper arm . The TIME-4H electrode dissect free , thread cut implant pull nerve remove . Following explantation normal wound treatment conduct stitch remove accord standard procedure .</detailed_description>
