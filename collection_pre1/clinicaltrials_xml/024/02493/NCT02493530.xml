	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , open-label , study TGR-1202 , PI3K delta inhibitor , administer together ruxolitinib patient myeloproliferative neoplasm ( specifically : polycythemia vera , primary myelofibrosis , PPV-MF PET-MF ) MDS/MPN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TGR-1202 + Ruxolitinib PMF PPV-MF PET-MF MDS/MPN Polycythemia Vera Resistant Hydroxyurea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The escalation include 2 initial sequential stage . Stage 1 include myelofibrosis hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patient already take therapeutic level ruxolitinib , achieve maximal response high tolerate dose ruxolitinib discuss among investigator . Only TGR-1202 escalate modify 3+3 dose escalation algorithm determine MTD TGR-1202 give give dose ruxolitinib . Stage 2 include myelofibrosis hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patient never JAK-STAT inhibitory agent , include simultaneously initiation ruxolitinib TGR-1202 . In Stage 2 , JAK Inhibitor naïve patient receive TGR-1202 recommend dose establish Cohort 1 , ruxolitinib . As patient Stage 1 ruxolitinib different dos , dose level Stage 2 expand meet requirement safety analysis .</detailed_description>
