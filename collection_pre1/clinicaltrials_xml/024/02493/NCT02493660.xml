	<brief_title>A Pivotal Study Assess InSpace™ Device Treatment Full Thickness Massive Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-inferiority , prospective , single blind , multi-center , randomize , control , pivotal study evaluate safety effectiveness InSpace™ device primary surgical treatment full thickness MRCT comparison Partial Repair full thickness MRCT perform arthroscopic procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Main Positive diagnostic image MRI index shoulder indicate full thickness Massive Rotator Cuff Tear ( MRCT ) , measure ≥ 5 cm diameter involve ≥ two tendon ( confirm Intraoperatively ) Functional deltoid muscle preserve passive range motion physical examination Documented VAS score &gt; 30 mm pain Failed nonoperative treatment least 4 month Patient general good health , independent , comply postoperative evaluation visit . Main Known allergy device material ( copolymer PLA εcaprolactone ) Evidence follow condition : 1. significant glenohumeral acromiohumeral arthritis 2. full thickness cartilage loss see MRI 3. glenohumeral instability ( excessive translation humeral head glenoid fossa ) 4. preexist deltoid defect deltoid palsy 5. major joint trauma , infection necrosis 6. partial thickness tear supraspinatous 7. fully reparable rotator cuff tear [ Tear le 5 cm diameter ( &lt; 4 cm2 ) retractable tendon fully repair ] The subject require concomitant subscapularis repair and/or labral repair Previous surgery index shoulder past 1 year , exclude diagnostic arthroscopy The subject 's condition bilateral rotator cuff repair schedule schedule course study contra lateral shoulder Major medical condition could affect quality life influence result study ( e.g . HIV immunosuppressive condition , active malignancy past 5 year , acute MI , CVA , etc . ) Documented evidence history drug/alcohol abuse within 12 month enrollment The subject 's condition represent worker 's compensation case The subject currently involve healthrelated litigation procedure Females childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding plan become pregnant course study Concurrent participation investigational clinical study one month prior enrollment entire study period The subject implant metallic device ( e.g. , cardiac pacemaker , insulin pump , nerve stimulators ) , medically implant clip electronically , magnetically mechanically activated implant would contraindicate undergoing MRI scan claustrophobia would inhibit ability undergo MRI scan . The subject physically mentally compromise ( e.g. , currently treat psychiatric disorder , senile dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , etc . ) , extent Investigator judge subject unable unlikely remain compliant followup The subject receive prescription narcotic pain medication condition unrelated index shoulder condition The subject currently acute infection area surround surgical site .</criteria>
