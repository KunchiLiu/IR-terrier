	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular oedema ( DMO ) sight-threatening problem diabetic patient swell macula . Patients DMO receive laser treatment achieve good acuity finally . However , patient still difficulty read even proper treatment . In project , investigator aim explore effectiveness different training paradigm improve read performance patient DMO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Training Reading Rehabilitation Patients With Diabetic Macular Oedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diabetic macular oedema ( DMO ) , receive laser photocoagulation , achieve good outcome distance acuity . However , patient , particularly develop parafoveal scotoma , still difficulty reading . Inability read read slowly lead potential loss job , well enjoyment reading leisure . In study , investigator aim investigate effectiveness read rehabilitation use perceptual learning paradigm enhance read performance patient read difficulty due DMO . Also , fundamental mechanism explain read problem patient DMO read Chinese examine . The investigator hypothesize perceptual training would show improvement reading . The investigator ' primary hypothesis temporal visual processing speed spatial visual span improve perceptual training . The investigator ' secondary hypothesis read speed fixation stability improve training .</detailed_description>
