	<detailed_description>Gastro-oesophageal reflux ( GORD ) extraoesophageal manifestation present variety symptom adult paediatric population . In child effect refluxate upper oesophageal sphincter ( UES ) implicate contributory factor underlie pathological process number condition include apnoea , asthma , chronic cough , subglottic stenosis , chronic rhinosinusitis otitis medium . The absence typical symptom addition inability obtain formal symptom history young paediatric population contribute difficulty establish diagnosis . At present study data directly measure extraoesophageal reflux correlation oesophageal pH monitor child . As result baseline data paediatric population subsequently measureable definition significant extraoesophageal reflux event . There poor correlation reflux event measure oesophageal probe extra-oesophageal symptom reflux . Studies demonstrate 51 % patient without pharyngeal reflux abnormal distal oesophageal pH study . This secondary technical concern regard ability probe detect aerosolized vapour form reflux pharynx due inadequacy definition significant reflux event upper oesophageal sphincter . Moving cephaled ( upwards ) within upper aerodigestive tract result shorter , high pH event may recognise use traditional oesophageal analysis , define pH &lt; 4 define significant oesophageal reflux event . The use twenty-four hour oesophageal pH monitoring regard establish technique diagnosis GORD , however technique less reliable detect extra-oesophageal reflux . The Dx-pH Measurement system ( Dx-pH ; Respiratory Technology Corp. , San Diego , CA ) sensitive minimally invasive transnasal device detection aerosolize extra-oesophageal acid reflux posterior oropharynx . The investigator intend use Dx-pH measurement system Peptest salivary pepsin assay ( RBiomed , UK ) child already undergo oesophageal pH study . The investigator aim assess feasibility system paediatric population , provide baseline data validate use measure extra-oesophageal reflux event child . These result correlate symptom questionnaire score result 24 hour oesophageal pH study result . The investigator ' result guide interventional study area , eventual aim improve diagnosis guide treatment extra-oesophageal manifestation GORD</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All child age 1 year old 16 year old consecutively refer outpatient 24 hour oesophageal pH / impedance monitoring invite participate study . This regardless underlying diagnosis , aetiology manifestation symptom . Children age 1 year old . Children 1 year old exclude due technical difficulty place pH / impedance monitoring probe DxpH probe nostril . Firstly , due size restriction place 2 probe one nostril . Secondly , nonpathologic high incidence regurgitation posit age 1 make data difficult interpret . Children nasogastric feeding tube situ exclude . Firstly due difficulty place secure nasogastric , oesophageal pH DxpH probe ( 3 tube / probe ) nostril , resultant bilateral nasal obstruction . Secondly , nasogastric tube cause increase iatrogenic reflux within pharynx , make data difficult interpret create artificial reflux event . Children cleft palate prior surgical repair exclude DxpH probe difficult locate oropharynx may displace oral cavity . Children require pH monitoring inpatient acute medical admission . Children exclude study condition necessitate acute hospital admission , therefore participation study affect ongoing investigation , treatment acute condition .</criteria>
