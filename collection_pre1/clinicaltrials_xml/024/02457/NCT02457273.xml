	<brief_title>Phase II Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety TLC388 Differentiated Neuroendocrine Carcinomas Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open-label , single-arm , two-stage , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety Lipotecan® monotherapy subject poorly differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma . Only subject fail first line chemotherapy ( Etoposide plus platinum ) due treatment intolerance radiographic progressive disease ( PD ) , per RECIST v1.1 , eligible participate study . The scheduled assessment perform identify calendar schedule , affect delay therapy , drug holiday event might lead imbalance treatment arm timing disease assessment . Efficacy result base radiographic assessment review investigator . Eligible subject receive 40 mg/m2 Lipotecan® , give 30 ( +3 ) minute intravenous infusion , Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle PD , unacceptable toxicity consent withdrawal occur .</detailed_description>
