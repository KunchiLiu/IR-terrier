	<brief_title>A Multi-Institutional Registry CyberKnife Stereotactic Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation ( CK-SAPBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy breast cancer deliver use several whole breast partial breast approach . The optimal approach unknown . The utilization partial breast irradiation grow due convenience few fraction versus fifteen- thirty treatment require conventional hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy . Early result partial breast technique promise , show similar cancer control toxicity . There large body mature Phase I/II preliminary Phase III data available explore replacement WBI accelerate course radiation therapy restrict region around tumor bed ( accelerate Partial Breast Irradiation , aPBI ) use variety technique . For appropriately select patient treated modern technique , result encourage technique show safe , tolerable , highly reproducible outcome similar WBI . Currently , limit data assess quality life , cosmetic oncologic outcome follow stereotactic partial breast irradiation large patient population . Our study first essential step aggregate outcome patient undergo type external beam irradiation large patient population .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects eligible participate registry receive CKSAPBI 5 fraction within 12 week surgery sign institution specific consent form . Additionally , subject consider standard risk optimal CKSAPBI meet follow criterion : Newly diagnose AJCC ( seventh edition ) Stage 0 I breast cancer . On histological examination , tumor must DCIS invasive nonlobular carcinoma breast Surgical treatment breast must wide excision , lumpectomy partial mastectomy Age 50 year great ER positive PR positive Her2 negative ( IHC 01+ ; IHC 2+ , FISH must nonamplified ) Subjects invasive tumor undergo axillary sentinel lymph node evaluation axillary lymph node dissection . Negative inked surgical margin excision reexcision , clear invasive tumor DCIS least 2 mm Negative postexcision postreexcision mammography cancer present malignancyassociated microcalcifications remain suspicious calcification breast radiotherapy . Alternatively , specimen radiograph obtain show suspicious calcification . No involved axillary lymph node , N0 ( i+ ) allow Target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must &lt; 30 % base treatment plan CT Patients invasive lobular carcinoma nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma . Patients tumor great 2 cm Patients surgical margin microscopically assess clear least 2mm pathological evaluation . Patients multicentric carcinoma clinically radiographically suspicious area ipsilateral breast unless confirm negative malignancy biopsy . Breast MRI require exclude multicentric disease additional suspicious area require biopsy exclude malignancy . Patients involve axillary node . Patients collagen vascular disease ( active ) . Patient know deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation know mutation high penetrance gene ( TP53 , STK11 , PTEN , CDH1 ) Patients prior ipsilateral breast irradiation . Patients prior ipsilateral thoracic irradiation . Patients Paget 's disease nipple . Patients diffuse suspicious microcalcifications . Patients suspicious microcalcifications remain postexcision mammogram . Patients receive ( neo ) adjuvant systemic therapy hormonal therapy Patients oncoplastic reconstruction absence surgical clip</criteria>
