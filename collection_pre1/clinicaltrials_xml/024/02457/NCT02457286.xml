	<brief_title>Improving Insulin Resistance To Treat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common cause chronic liver disease United States common cause unexplained mildly elevate serum aminotransferase level . NAFLD , initially felt benign , know potentially progress cirrhosis complication , include development liver cancer . NAFLD strongly correlate Type 2 Diabetes , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome ( 1-6 ) . It hypothesize pathogenesis hepatic injury NAFLD due insulin resistance oxidative stress associate obesity metabolic syndrome ( 7 ) . No adequate medical treatment show effective treatment NAFLD . Several study ( 8-22 ) evaluate effect metformin patient NAFLD relation insulin resistance , Homeostatic Model Assessment Insulin Resistance Index ( HOMA-IR ) value , aminotransferase level , liver morphology , histological improvement treatment . These study however show discrepant result relation aminotransferase level study able evaluate histological improvement follow-up biopsy . There study focus specifically pre-diabetic population . These patient increase risk progress diabetes may exhibit different response treatment metformin non-diabetic diabetic patient . All study support fact metformin beneficial effect improve insulin resistance decrease incidence metabolic syndrome , consensus thus far influence NAFLD . The majority publish study limit small sample size . Randomized controlled trial adequate sample size long duration need well study assess endpoint liver morphology histology . The result pilot study significant metformin may relatively safe inexpensive way , addition lifestyle modification , treat NAFLD . The result pilot study pave way large power , long duration study require answer question .</detailed_description>
