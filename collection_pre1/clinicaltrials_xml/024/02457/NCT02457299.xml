	<brief_title>Esophagectomy With Without Prior Ischemic Gastric Preconditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophagectomy gastric pull-up reconstruction current preferred operation either benign malignant esophageal disease require resection . One major complication esophagectomy gastric pull-up reconstruction esophagus-stomach connection ( gastric conduit ) failure , carry significant morbidity mortality . Many factor contribute development gastric conduit failure , relative decrease blood flow ( ischemia ) tip gastric conduit believe one major factor . This due sacrifice 3 5 gastric blood supply leave tip conduit rely collateral vessel . In effort improve perfusion gastric conduit minimize ischemia , relatively novel approach ischemic gastric preconditioning devise , without concrete evidence show advantage reduction gastric conduit failure . Patients meet eligibility criterion agree participation study randomize either esophagectomy ( two-stage ) without ( one-stage ) ischemic gastric precondition incidence gastric conduit failure compare . Those randomized two-stage procedure laparoscopic stag ischemic gastric condition pyloric Botox injection do 7-10 day prior esophagectomy randomize one-stage procedure esophagectomy perform . Validated quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires complete preoperative visit well day discharge postoperative follow-up timepoints : 3 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month . Data collection mostly collect electronic medical record review include , limited : demographic data ; image laboratory value ; past medical , surgical social history ; inpatient intraoperative data ; vitals sign . Patients assessed adverse event throughout study participation .</detailed_description>
