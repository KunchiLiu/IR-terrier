	<brief_title>A Prospective Multicenter Study Acute Chronic Liver Failure China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute-on chronic liver failure ( ACLF ) first describe Japanese researcher 1995 . In 2011 , American Association Study Liver Disease ( AASLD ) European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) conclude core characteristic ACLF multiple organ failure high short-term mortality . In 2013 , EASL-CLIF ( European Association Study The Liver-chronic liver failure ) establish CLIF-SOFA ( chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment ) criterion ACLF prospective multicenter study 29 liver unit eight European country 1 year , focus patient alcoholic cirrhosis acute decompensation ( AD ) . In China , patient acute deterioration previously chronic liver disease diagnose chronic severe hepatitis , 2008 patient term `` ACLF '' , due APASL reach consensus diagnostic criterion ACLF . In Asia-Pacific region , majority liver disease viral hepatitis , western country , alcoholic liver disease . There sharp east-west divide respect definition ACLF , especially definition chronic liver disease precipitate event . The investigator analyze 6 year ' data hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) -related chronic liver disease patient AD two affiliated hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School Medicine . These data also quantify sent EASL-CLIF centre analysis . Now , data RenJi Hospital completely verify analyze . Eighty percent whole patient clinically diagnosed cirrhosis , 30 % pathological diagnosis . Through analysis liver tissue liver transplantation ( LT ) patient , 95 % pseudolobules . The residual 5 % liver tissue S3 stage progressive liver fibrosis . Compared CANONIC ( EASL-CLIF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Cirrhosis ) , many similarity ACLF patient alcoholic cirrhosis HBV induce cirrhosis : ( 1 ) The age ACLF patient younger cirrhotic patient AD . ( 2 ) ACLF exist stage liver fibrosis . ( 3 ) The number organ failure decide severity disease related mortality patient . ( 4 ) Predisposition acute liver injury ( ALI ) correlate history disease outcome patient . ( 5 ) The 90-day mortality rate ACLF 45-50 % , obviously high non-ACLF patient ( 5 % ) . ( 6 ) Eastern western type ACLF similar SOFA score diagnostic criterion ( CLIF-OF CLIF-SOFA ) , similar prognostic model predict outcome ACLF non-ACLF patient . ACLF patient cirrhosis induce HBV alcoholism differ main type organ failure . The former group liver failure ( total bilirubin≥12mg/dl ) coagulation failure ( international normalize ratio ; INR≥2.5 ) , whereas latter group renal failure ( creatinine≥2mg/dl use renal replacement therapy ) nervous system failure ( hepatic encephalopathy ; HE≥III grade ) . Research hepatic pathology HBV-induced ACLF patient LT RenJi Hospital demonstrate pathological characteristic ACLF may MHN/SMHN ( massive hepatic necrosis/submassive hepatic necrosis ) background liver pseudolobules . Regeneration hepatic progenitor cell , cholestasis , sepsis possible pathological feature ACLF . It necessary conduct prospective multicentre study clarify eastern type ACLF differences eastern western type ACLF . The investigator go identify three key point : ( 1 ) Whether HBV non-HBV ACLFs belong homogenous disease entity share diagnostic criterion , disease grade classification prognostic model ; ( 2 ) Whether acute deteriorate patient cirrhosis mild fibrosis ( S1-S2 ) belong homogenous entity ? ( 3 ) To clarify heterogenous group APASL criterion diagnose ACLF patient . The investigator plan enroll 2000-3000 consecutive patient January December 2015 . The research carry 13 Chinese national wide liver center whose total bed around 500 . The research two stage . The first stage enrollment 2000-3000 consecutive patient January December 2015 . Only chronic liver disease patient various etiology AD ALI enrol . Biochemical parameter , organ failure evaluation , image test result treatment therapy record day 1,4,7,14,21 28 ( last visit date ) enrollment accord case report form . If patient die undergo LT , data 24h prior death LT also record . The second stage follow-up January 2016 December 2017 . If patient improve discharge , 24 month ' follow-up conduct . Whenever patient die LT , study end . Follow-up clinical visiting , telephone call acceptable patient unable attend . During follow-up , patient hospitalize whenever new ALI AD . Similar data collect reference prior admission follow-up restart . Every patient unique number . As soon hospitalize , name , age , sex , ID ( identification ) number , telephone number , e-mail address , WeChat ( popular mobile phone text voice message communication service ) number , family address , degree education collect . The investigator take note history liver disease . The investigator also find etiology liver disease , hepatitis B , alcoholic liver disease , autoimmune liver disease . For viral hepatitis , investigator ask antiviral therapy conduct . The investigator ascertain patient history cirrhosis long . The investigator ascertain patient follow predispose factor : HBV reactivation , bacterial infection , active alcohol intake , HBV superimpose hepatitis virus , gastrointestinal bleeding , portal vein thrombosis , surgery , intake hepatotoxic drug herb , physiological exhaustion . The investigator establish main cause admission : gastrointestinal bleeding , hepatic encephalopathy , ascites , bacterial infection ALI . The investigator determine whether patient chronic disease hypertension , coronary heart disease , diabetes , chronic renal disease , connective tissue disease . During hospitalization , data collect 1 , 4 , 7,14 , 21 28 day ( last visit date , patient hospitalize less 28 day ) , 24h prior death LT ( patient dy LT ) focus follow three aspect . The first aspect evaluation organ failure . The circulatory system evaluate measure heart rate blood pressure use vasopressor . Renal function evaluate serum creatinine renal replacement therapy . Coagulation function evaluate INR ( international normalize ratio prothrombin time ) . Liver function evaluate serum total bilirubin . The respiratory system evaluate ratio oxyhemoglobin saturation fraction inspire oxygen . The nervous system evaluate grade hepatic encephalopathy . Bacterial infection , include pneumonia , urinary tract infection , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , spontaneous bacteremia , cellulitis evaluate positive culture result image finding . Systemic inflammatory reactive syndrome , sepsis , severe sepsis septic shock also assess . Gastrointestinal bleeding admission , treatment diuretic , paracentesis record . The investigator establish whether ascites hepatic encephalopathy medically control . The second aspect laboratory examination . Tests admission include routine blood , urine stool test , liver renal function test , blood electrolyte , blood-gas analysis , blood glucose , coagulation test , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , procalcitonin ( PCT ) , HBV antibodies antigen , anti-hepatitis A ( IgM ) , HBV-DNA , anti-hepatitis E ( IgM ) , anti-hepatitis C , immunoglobulins ( IgA , IgG , IgM IgM-4 ) . Tests time include blood , urine stool routine test , liver renal function test , blood electrolyte , blood glucose , coagulation test , CRP ( C-reactive protein ) PCT ( procalcitonin ) . Tests optionally do hospitalization include autoantibody measurement , blood culture ( patient fever shiver ) , sputum culture ( suspicion pulmonary infection ) , middle urine cultivation ( suspicion urinary tract infection ) ascites culture ( suspicion spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ) . The third aspect imaging . During hospitalization , thoracic X ray compute tomography ( CT ) do diagnose pulmonary infection . Abdominal CT ( enhanced necessary ) , B ultrasound FibroScan elastography do diagnose cirrhosis ( fibrosis ) , portal thrombosis , esophageal gastric varix hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients follow regularly discharge . When patient die follow-up , time death main cause death note . When patient undergo LT follow-up , time LT result hepatic pathology note . Follow-up clinical visit telephone call depend whether patient attend clinic . Clinical follow-up month 2 year add 24 visit . The time visit record . Antiviral therapy alcohol intake monitor ( patient . Laboratory test include routine blood test , liver renal function test , coagulation test , CRP PCT . B ultrasound do monitor cirrhosis ( fibrosis ) hepatocellular carcinoma . Telephone follow-up 28 day , 3 , 6,9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month . If patient die , time death main cause death record . If patient alive , investigator determine whether new complication ( e.g . gastrointestinal bleeding , hepatic encephalopathy , ascites , bacterial infection ) hepatocellular carcinoma . Referring structure clinical research CANONIC study , 13 hospital screen join . The investigator meet every three month exchange result idea . All young committee member Chinese Society Hepatology campaign join research . There core group 3-4 member comprise expert interest ACLF . These core member responsible make policy . Members core group flexible . Monopolizing arbitrariness forbid . Independent department gastroenterology , hepatology infectious disease requirement hospital . Every hospital one principal investigator ( PI ) representative . The PI head department involve clinical work . The PI make ward round least twice weekly evaluate patient beside bed . Young member Chinese Society Hepatology prioritize PI . If young member undertake clinical work , recommend eligible attend physician . PIs make ward round least twice weekly evaluate patient . PIs assistant data collection . It would well assistant graduate student charge research . There measure guarantee quality follow-up . First , set fast-track follow-up card patient . These patient priority make appointment see doctor . Second , every PI assistant . Every assistant equip cellphone patient call visit doctor immediately hospitalize emergency . Third , set WeChat group patient inform follow-up 1 week advance . Fourth , every assistant master follow-up strategy .</detailed_description>
