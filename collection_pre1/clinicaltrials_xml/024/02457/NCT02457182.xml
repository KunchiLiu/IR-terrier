	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome ( IC/BPS ) associate significant morbidity poorly understood underlie pathophysiology . IC/BPS comprise symptom complex define American Urological Association ( AUA ) `` An unpleasant sensation ( pain , pressure , discomfort ) perceive related urinary bladder , associate low urinary tract symptom six week duration , absence infection identifiable cause '' ( 1 ) . Up 11 % woman affect IC/BPS ( 2 ) , disorder may significantly underdiagnosed ( 3 ) . A 2008 study ( 4 ) indicate 43 % patient IC/BPS require multimodal therapy average 7-12 yearly clinic visit cost $ 9,000/patient . Twenty percent woman report wage loss &gt; $ 4000 per year ( 5 ) . Current theory cause IC/BPS include infectious agent , defective uroepithelium permeable toxic substance , structural abnormality , neurogenic inflammation , increase neurologic sensitivity , allergic response involve increased number bladder mast cell ( 6 ) . Despite theory , reliable treatment remain elusive . Most IC/BPS treatment target one propose mechanism , involve trial error several therapy ( 1 ) , often utilize multiple modality ( 7 ) . Treatment success range 47-93 % intravesical instillation 21-64 % oral therapy , discontinuation rate 80 % due intolerable side effect ( 1 ) . Efficacious treatment IC/BPS apply great proportion patient limited side effect urgently need . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) , Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) -based therapy , potentially fulfills need . The Interstitial Cystitis Association ( ICA ) , patient-led organization , sponsor survey 2100 IC/BPS patient . They report 84 % tried CAM therapy 55 % survey report physician recommend CAM ( 8 ) . According 2007 National Health Interview survey ( 9 ) , CAM use 38 % adult United States . MBSR successfully employ treat chronic pain syndrome use disorder multiple chemical sensitivity , chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia ( 10 ) , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) ( 11 ) . These disorder may coexist patient IC/BPS ( 6 ) . In IC/BPS , increase stress positively correlate increase pain ( 12 ) ; one study report 80 % IC/BPS patient find stress reduction decrease symptom ( 8 ) . MBSR find efficacious treatment urgency urinary incontinence , urinary disorder closely related IC/BPS ( 13 , 14 ) . While MBSR show therapeutic promise condition similar coexist IC/BPS , rat helpful patient suffer IC/BPS , rigorous randomize clinical trial investigate efficacy intervention lacking ( 8 ) . OBJECTIVES/AIMS/HYPOTHESES Ultimately , investigator long-term goal provide much-needed treatment IC/BPS use patient-centered therapy MBSR . The objective research conduct pilot RCT explore whether MBSR acceptable patient result improve symptom add IC/BPS 1st 2nd-line treatment recommend American Urological Association guideline ( see Table 1 ) . The investigator hypothesize 8-week MBSR class acceptable IC/BPS patient MBSR use conjunction traditional 1st 2nd line therapy improve symptom compare IC/BPS patient use traditional 1st 2nd line therapy alone . If pilot study demonstrate effectiveness acceptance MBSR , would provide data justify large randomize control trial . If investigator ' hypothesis support exploratory study , MBSR , understudy potentially underutilized therapy , expand treatment option IC/BPS patient . The investigator ' aim pursuit goal ; Aim # 1 : To determine whether addition MBSR 1st 2nd line therapy recommend AUA guideline improve IC/BPS symptom measure primary outcome Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) , well O'Leary-Sant Symptom Problem Index ( OSPI ) , Visual Analog ( VAS ) pain scale . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize MBSR effective treatment IC/BPS measure validated GRA , O'Leary-Sant VAS pain scale . Aim # 2 : To evaluate whether participation structure MBSR class improve quality life , sexual function overall self-efficacy patient IC/BPS , base change Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) , Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) , Pain Self-Efficacy Scale ( SES ) . Hypothesis : The investigator ' hypothesize MBSR improve quality life , sexual function impression self-efficacy measure validate scale</detailed_description>
