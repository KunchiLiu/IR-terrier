	<brief_title>The Cirrhosis Outpatient Optimization , Readmission &amp; Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telemonitoring suggest potential benefit patient cirrhosis . However , date , prospective study exist support idea . Hence , investigator study would like explore use home telemonitoring device vital sign capture capability recently-discharged patient cirrhosis decrease 30-day readmission , mortality cost . This prospective , randomize control trial compare two strategy post-discharged care patient cirrhosis-related hospitalization . First treatment arm incorporate Vivify home monitoring device post hospital care.Home monitoring kit include tablet wireless internet vital sign monitoring capability ( temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , weight pulse oximetry need ) device ability trigger alert `` liver care coordinator . '' Second treatment arm continue standard care therapy post- hospitalized patient receive upon discharge , i.e . return clinic appointment , education regard sign worsen symptom watch , well contact number connect doctor nurse .</detailed_description>
