	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn brain activity individual without Parkinson disease ( PD ) move low limb . The investigator also want see two different type partner dance affect brain activity individual without PD . Testing take place Atlanta VA Medical Center Emory University . The investigator expect enroll 140 people study five-year period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persons Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) impair mobility , adversely affect quality life . The effectiveness adapt tango dance , participant lead ( internally guide : IG ) follow ( externally guide : EG ) movement show . To improve outcome PD , underlie brain mechanism motor impairment improvement must study . IG EG movement distinct brain activity pattern . Individuals PD trouble IG movement problem help strategy use `` leading . '' During `` follow '' , participant PD use many external cue , help movement PD , EG task bypass basal ganglion , part brain affect PD . In old person PD , investigator aim : - determine brain activation pattern IG EG foot movement . - look effect IG EG train brain activation along mobility improvement . The investigator begin functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging test scanner . The investigator look brain area correlate clinically-used foot-tapping task , IG EG condition older person without PD . Then , investigator assess relative effectiveness IG versus EG training adapt tango class , compare group participate health education , improve mobility foot tap . Participants PD assess disease severity . They receive test outcome measure `` OFF '' `` ON '' PD-specific medication follow time point : - 1 week training - 1 week training - 1 month training Participants must attend 20 lesson IG EG adapt tango 12 week , taught experience instructor . In functional MRI ( fMRI ) scanner , investigator assess participant improved foot tap training . The investigator also look change activation specific brain circuit along training effect upon mobility . The long-term goal improve motor training much possible person PD understand foot movement brain circuitry PD well brain change circuitry train effective . This work propose illumine information brain function important continue progress rehabilitative care person PD .</detailed_description>
