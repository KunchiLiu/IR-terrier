	<brief_title>Taselisib Enzalutamide Treating Patients With Androgen Receptor Positive Triple-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability taselisib give combination enzalutamide : Assessment dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) first 4 week treatment ( cycle 1 ) . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine safety tolerability taselisib give combination enzalutamide : Determination maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) taselisib give combination enzalutamide . ( Phase Ib ) III . To evaluate efficacy , measure clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , enzalutamide + taselisib patient androgen receptor positive ( AR+ ) triple negative ( TN ) metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) enzalutamide + taselisib patient AR+ TN MBC . II . To assess pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) taselisib enzalutamide patient AR+ TN MBC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore predictor biomarker response mechanism resistance base exploratory analysis tumor tissue obtain biopsy . II . Levels phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . III . Presence mutation phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) gene . IV . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) ( IHC , fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) estrogen receptor ( ER ) /progesterone receptor ( PR ) level ( IHC ) tumor biopsy metastatic site . V. Levels mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) activity measure phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK1/2 ) ( IHC ) phosphorylated p-ribosomal protein S6 ( S6 ) ( S235/236 S240/244 ) baseline upon progression disease . VI . Levels phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( p-AKT ) ( IHC ) baseline upon progression disease . VII . Gene expression profile assign triple negative subtype . VIII . Whole exome deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) -sequencing ( seq ) DNA isolated baseline upon progression . IX . Plasma circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) analysis ass PIK3CA mutation status response resistance . X . To assess predictive effect PIK3CA mutation PTEN loss PFS CBR . XI . To evaluate ability multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform early therapy predict biological clinical response . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study taselisib follow randomized phase II study . PHASE IB : Patients receive taselisib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 enzalutamide PO QD day 9-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive taselisib PO QD enzalutamide Phase Ib . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity due enzalutamide may continue receive taselisib . ARM II : Patients receive enzalutamide PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon disease progression , patient may crossover Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
