	<brief_title>Validation Simple Approach Estimate Alveolar Recruitability ARDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) characterize major loss lung volume due alveolar flooding , atelectasis consolidation [ 1 ] . Positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) apply recruit non-aerated poorly aerate lung tissue , thus may improve gas exchange patient ARDS [ 2 ] . However , PEEP may also harmful overdistending previously open lung tissue . The potential effectiveness benefit high PEEP level depend patient 's recruitability . Previous technique assess recruitability usually reserve clinical research ( compute tomography , multiple pressure-volume curve ) [ 3-4 ] need special equipment . A simple , feasible bedside method assess individual need PEEP term recruitability seem essential improve prognosis syndrome . The investigator therefore propose simplified approach derive previous study [ 5 ] estimate alveolar recruitability bedside . Objectives : The major aim test hypothesis simplify approach valid method assess alveolar derecruitment bedside comparison direct measurement lung volume derecruitment . Methods : This physiological study enroll 30 patient three Intensive Care Units St. Michael 's Hospital two year . All patient passively ventilate two PEEP level ( 15 cmH2O 5 cmH2O ) plateau pressure limit less 35 cmH2O . Respiratory mechanic , lung volume ( use nitrogen washout/washin technique ) , quasi-static Pressure-Volume curve , lung ultrasound , arterial blood gas assess PEEP level . In patient already esophageal catheter place , Pes also measure . Data Analysis : The primary endpoint correlation bias Vder estimate approach one measure multiple P-V curve technique pair test , correlation Bland Altman analysis</detailed_description>
