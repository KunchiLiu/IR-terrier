	<brief_summary>This prospective descriptive pharmacokinetic study conduct among newly diagnose patient register two SMRU TB clinic locate Thai-Myanmar border . This study aim recruit ( 1 ) 30 adult HIV co-infection ( 2 ) 30 adult without HIV co-infection one year . Patients give standard 6 month anti-TB drug per WHO guideline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The threat tuberculosis HIV remain major public health issue world . Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR TB ) also rise public health issue . Currently available standardize TB treatment 6 month duration . Previous pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) study anti-TB drug show number factor HIV status , diabetes , malnutrition , age , sex , race , genetics ( e.g . NAT2 polymorphism ) , drug- drug interaction food interaction may cause variation PK and/or treatment outcome . But findings persistent one study another , example Chideya S. et al 's study Botswana show low Cmax anti-TB drug frequently occur TB/HIV coinfected patient low Cmax pyrazinamide relate poor treatment outcome . On hand Requena-MÃ©ndez A. et al 's study show variation rifampin Cmax relate HIV . Large between-patient variability PK parameter recently show strongly associate TB treatment failure possibly emergence drug resistant TB . The primary objective study aim describe plasma drug level first-line anti- tuberculosis drug two different pulmonary TB patient group : ( 1 ) adult HIV co-infection ( 2 ) adult without HIV co-infection . The secondary objective investigate clinical , microbiological immunological outcome study participant relation plasma drug level conduct full genome sequence spoligotyping MTB strain . Plasma drug level venous blood measure densely 13 time per day two occasion : first dose Day 1 6 week treatment . Thereafter plasma drug level measure six hour post-dose month 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 . Clinical , microbiological immunological parameter liver renal function , CRP LTA4G sputum examination ( smear microscopy , RNA PCR , culture ) monitor clinical progress also measure . The analysis plasma drug level relation clinical microbiological outcome carry order describe PK/PD anti-TB drug clinical , microbiogical immunological outcome consideration possible factor would influence relationship .</detailed_description>
