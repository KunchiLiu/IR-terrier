	<brief_summary>CUT*HIVTHER 001 randomise placebo-controlled Phase I/II study aim explore safety immunogenicity two different mode delivery GTU® DNA plasmid vaccine ( GTU®-multiHIV B clade ) HIV infect volunteer antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) : - Transcutaneous ( TC ) delivery enhance intramuscular delivery - Electroporation ( EP ) enhance intramuscular delivery Participants randomise 1:1:1 TC : EP : saline purpose analysis . Half saline group receive TC saline half receive EP saline . 30 HIV infect male female volunteer age 18-45 year , ART least 6 month 2 HIV plasma viral load measurement &lt; 50 copy HIV RNA/ml prior enrolment . The investigational HIV-1 vaccine GTU®-MultiHIV B clade encodes MultiHIV antigen synthetic fusion protein consist full-length polypeptide Rev , Nef , Tat , p17 p24 contain 20 Th CTL epitopes protease , reverse transcriptase ( RT ) gp160 region HAN2 HIV-1 B clade . Vaccine provide seal vial 2mg/ml , single 1ml IM injection 2mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA IM ( thigh ) require deliver 2mg dose . Individuals Group 2 receive 0.4mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA 0.2ml administer TC , novel needle-free method vaccine delivery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator explore combination regimen overall aim ( ) optimise immune response ( ii ) develop safe well tolerated strategy favour development T-cell response may enhance anti-HIV HIV therapy forward look goal work towards functional eradication infection . The investigator propose combine previously use IM TC method preclinical data suggest combination method favour development CD8 T cell response . All group receive 6.0mg vaccine IM give 3 dos 12 week . Group 1 receive 6.0mg IM electroporation ( EP ) Group 2 receive 6.0mg IM without EP together additional 1.2mg vaccine TC . The primary immunogenicity endpoint determine whether either intervention group augment cellular response vaccine specific peptide relation baseline . It anticipate none subject receive saline placebo would increase vaccine specific response relative baseline . Therefore difference active group saline placebo sufficiently large , example 80 % responder GTU®-MultiHIV DNA active group , &lt; 10 % control group , would significant . Should regimes prove safe , acceptable induce significant immunogenicity intention move one regimes large study power determine potential long-term impact therapy use combination conventional ARV regimen . Proof concept DNA vaccination induce de novo HIV specific response associate control viral replication , would justify investigation use immunotherapy combine ART intensification and/or anti-latency drug .</detailed_description>
