	<criteria>Subjects ≥18 year age undergoing craniotomy/craniectomy pathological process supratentorial region posterior fossa Subjects legally authorize representative must willing participate study provide write informed consent . Surgical wound classification Class I The cuff native dura along craniotomy edge side adequate , base surgeon 's judgment , facilitate suture allow sufficient surface area adherence investigational product Presence intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leakage follow primary dural closure Valsalva maneuver Subjects dural lesion recent surgery still potential CSF leakage . Chemotherapy within 30days prior enrollment schedule within 7days follow surgery Radiation therapy head within 30days prior enrollment schedule within 7days follow surgery A previous craniotomy/craniectomy within 6 month prior study surgery . Known hypersensitivity component investigational product . Subjects know allergy FD &amp; C Blue # 1 dye Subjects infection present surgical site Subjects infection indicate one following : clinical diagnosis infection , fever , positive urine culture , positive blood culture , positive chest Xray . Female subject childbearing potential positive pregnancy test intent become pregnant clinical study period . Female subject nurse . Exposure another investigational drug device clinical trial within 30 day prior enrollment anticipated 60 day followup period . Subjects severely alter renal hepatic function , compromise immune system autoimmune disease NOT receive hydrogel sealant . Subjects penetratring traumatic injury head damage dura Dural injury craniotomy/craniectomy eliminate widen craniotomy/craniectomy recreate native dural cuff . Patient gap durotomy edge great 2mm primary dural closure . Approaches would allow sutured dural closure transsphenoidal translabirinthine/petrosal/mastoid . Superficial penetration mastoid air cell allow . Use implant make synthetic material come direct contact dura Use fibrin sealant PEGbased sealant dural closure . Approved fibrin sealant may use hemostasis contact dura . Hydrocephalus , except occlusive hydrocephalus cause posterior fossa pathology incompletely open cerebrospinal fluid pathway , treat surgical procedure . Placement Gliadel Wafers Intersecting durotomy scar surgical path previous operation completely remove planned dural resection . Two separate cranial dural defect , include defect ventricular cannulation ventriculoperitoneal shunt . Subjects intraoperative finding identify surgeon may preclude conduct study procedure . Confined bony structure nerve present neural compression may result due swelling .</criteria>
