	<brief_summary>This study child fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) aim ( ) characterize self-regulation deficit , process important control emotion behavior , ( ii ) describe brain structure function underlie self-regulation , ( iii ) determine whether train improve self-regulation ability change brain behavior . Individuals FASD high risk cognitive social deficit , reflect difficulty self-regulation may lead mental health concern adulthood . Importantly , early intervention improve long-term outcome . However full extent self-regulation problem FASDs unknown underlie neuroanatomy fully describe . Furthermore , information best treat child FASDs lacking . Thus , investigator propose three study sample 8-12 year old child , 40 FASDs 20 typically develop control . In Study 1 , participant evaluate cognitive social self-regulation ability use clinical experimental test . In Study 2 , participant undergo 1-hour MRI scan session obtain measure brain structure function . In Study 3 , FASDs randomly assign immediate delayed treatment group . The immediate group undergo 12-weeks therapy Alert Program Self RegulationÂ® . On conclusion training , repeat Studies 1 2 follow retest , delayed treatment group undergo training . The investigator evaluate change cognitive social behavior brain structure function compare performance neuroimaging finding intervention . The investigator expect Alert training significantly improve behavior alter brain region important self-regulation . The finding yield important information improve self-regulation FASDs mitigating development mental health challenge .</brief_summary>
