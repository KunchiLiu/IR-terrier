	<brief_title>The Value CE-LUS During Robot-assisted Surgery Primary Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : The value contrast enhance laparoscopic ultrasound examination robot-assisted resection primary colorectal cancer surgery . Project : The follow project evaluate value contrast enhance Laparoscopic Ultrasound examination ( CE-LUS ) robot-assisted surgery CRC . The project `` The value contrast enhance laparoscopic ultrasound examination robot-assisted resection primary colorectal cancer surgery '' part Ph.D study University Southern Denmark . Purpose : 1.1 : The primary purpose investigate whether use contrast enhance ultrasound examination connection LUS procedure increase number detect liver metastasis . 1.2 : As secondary objective ; evaluation technical feasibility CE-LUS procedure robot-assisted resection primary colorectal cancer surgery . Background : Laparoscopic surgery cancer colon rectum seem equal standing open surgery regard morbidity , mortality oncologic result ( radicality re-lapse frequency long-term survival ) . Laparoscopic surgery CRC well-understood well-established surgical method , randomize trial deal long-term result . The late inventory work call good documentation long-term result call randomized study . Despite , number laparoscopic operation colorectal cancer ( CRC ) Denmark increase , laparoscopic surgery become established standard treatment CRC . The development minimally invasive surgery stop laparoscopic approach , robotic surgery currently evaluation particular rectal surgery CRC . Robot technology develop attempt overcome limitation characterize laparoscopic surgery . The establishment stable platform instrument witch increase rotate movement essential part robotic surgery . A motion-scaling filtering make sure image shake operation . The picture resolution enhance 3D visualization visual magnification operate field . A combination feature allow precise dissection tissue , suture improve bleeding-control compare conventional laparoscopy . Liver metastases frequent patient CRC 15-20 % patient already metastases diagnosis ( synchronous metastasis ) . Ultrasound examination open surgery ( IOUS ) show important diagnostic tool high sensitivity ( 98 % ) positive predictive value ( 86 % ) detection liver metastasis undiagnosed preoperative CT positron emission tomography ( PET-CT ) . IOUS consider gold standard hepatic metastasis within open surgery CRC . In laparoscopic surgery option disappears , likely laparoscopic ultrasound examination ( LUS ) , may provide information found IOUS . While laparoscopy laparoscopic ultrasound examination ( LUS ) well establish stag treatment upper gastrointestinal cancer , method sparsely evaluate treatment CRC . There old data deal use LUS TNM stag patient cancer colon rectum . Several small study investigate use LUS evaluate M-stage laparoscopic colorectal surgery study show increased detection liver metastasis . Overall , seem LUS well current pre-operative image modality . In prospective blind study percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination ( CEUS ) liver prove able detect significantly liver-metastases CRC conventional percutaneous ultrasound . With new second-generation contrast agent CEUS seem equivalent contrast-enhanced CT ( magnetic resonance imaging ) MRI detection liver-metastases . Liver metastases frequent patient CRC use intraoperative ultrasound ( IOUS ) open surgery CRC , previously regard gold standard . Contrast-enhanced IOUS ( CE-IOUS ) open surgery CRC sparsely evaluate , show increase sensitivity detection liver-metastases . Many patient rectum cancer receive pre-treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy , chemotherapy may make difficult identify exist metastasis liver . Studies show increased detection metastases contrast-enhanced ultrasound pretreatment chemotherapy . The sensitivity ultrasound examination improve use contrast enhance ultrasound.There single pilot study deal contrast-enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound ( CE-LUS ) primary CRC resection study reveal improved detection metastasis . In manner laparoscopic resection CRC , need robot- assist surgery able compensate lack intraoperative palpation IOUS . The use CE-LUS associate robotic surgery CRC patient study despite fact appear technically possible carry procedure robot procedure . With project want elucidate whether use CE-LUS robot-assisted surgery CRC increase detection rate liver metastases evaluate technical feasibility CE-LUS procedure . Method : The project prospective , descriptive study 50 consecutive patient schedule robot-assisted surgery primary CRC . All patient , prior schedule surgery , complete contrast enhance CT chest abdomen , part Tumor , Lymph node Metastases ( TNM ) evaluation . The CT scan make accord current guideline . At begin surgery patient get LUS examination specialist skills contrast-enhanced ultrasound . All liver segment systematically scan finding record registration form . After LUS examination liver procedure supply contrast enhanced examination . CE-LUS perform contrast agent SonoVueÂ® contain Sulphurhexafluoride accord department 's instruction CE-LUS procedure . A bolus 2.5 ml inject peripheral vein follow 10 ml isotonic saline . The liver systematically scan 3 phase ( arterial , venous parenchymatous phase ) search unrecognized liver metastasis . The procedure repeat 5 minute . The time take LUS CE-LUS measure technical challenge report . Time , challenge finding liver metastasis ( number , segment size ) enter registration form . If CE-LUS examination find undiagnosed liver metastasis , patient get intraoperative LUS-guided fine-needle aspirations- biopsy ( FNA ) tru-cut biopsy perform liver surgeon specialist lesion mark little silver pin . The latter use follow-up pretreatment locate potential rest tumor . The patient sent Department Surgery A , Odense University Hospital , multidisciplinary tumor conference ( MDT ) . All patient follow Departments usual routine adjuvant therapy . All patient include project undergo three-phase control CT scan 3 month surgery . This evaluate whether might overlook metastasis CE-LUS evaluation . All information patient enter recorded database . Ethics : The project review approve Science Ethics Committee , Project No : S- 20140154 . The project report Data Protection Agency . The study register ClinicalTrials.com database . Participation project voluntary , patient may time withdraw commitment participation . To date report serious life-threatening complication LUS examination probe report . The LUS instrument/ probe introduce abdominal cavity small hole ( `` gate '' ) surgeon use operation . Patients get scar / sore stomach usual . It specialist expertise ultrasound scanning , handle actual scan . If ultrasound scan find spread cancer , know surgery , may necessary take tissue sample suspicious area perhaps mark small silver pin . This order regain area later , determine whether spread cancer . In case patient diagnose treated department 's usual guideline area . The contrast agent use context associate serious risk well-known approve contrast agent . The ultrasound scan dangerous , contrast agent give temporarily problem form headache nausea ( prevalence 1-10 % ) , , rarely , transient weakness , vasodilation , hyperglycemia , sensory disturbance , rash visual disturbance ( frequency 0.1-1 % ) . The contrast medium circulate briefly body patient monitor general anesthetic , administer . [ 26 ] . There minimal risk bleed connection tissue sampling , otherwise side effect associate operation construction small silver pin . In follow-up include extra CT scan relation department 's usual procedure . There theoretical , modest risk- 0.01 % order develop new cancer disease . Time place The project carry The RAK-Center department Surgery A , Odense University Hospital , management Department Surgery A , Odense University Hospital , approve project . Schedule : January 2015 - March 2016 : Inclusion patient . March 2016 - September 2016 : Data Processing publication .

Andersen Economic Conditions : There seek financial support various foundation , include Cancer Society Region Southern research funding , conduct study . There commercial support giver , involved staff member get financial gain .</detailed_description>
