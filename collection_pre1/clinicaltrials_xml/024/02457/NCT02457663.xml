	<brief_title>Identification Validation Biomarkers Infections Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The burn literature replete suggest biomarkers infection identify sepsis infection burn patient , however , report largely untested . In order incorporation infection biomarker assessment become standard care , validation marker multi-center prospective study necessary . As majority biomarkers choose success patient population , ease measurement , possible best biomarkers infection yet discover patient population . Prospective identification validation novel biomarkers may also improve early identification infection burn patient . Early treatment infection sepsis directly correlate improve survival reduce cost care . In prospective , multi-center study , 200 patient four participate Texas burn hospital enrol admission discharge . The clinical research study team collect approximately 11 serum sample clinical data relate sepsis infection predictor severely burn adult patient , age 18-80 year old .
