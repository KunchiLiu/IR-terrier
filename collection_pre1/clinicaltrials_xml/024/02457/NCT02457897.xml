	<brief_summary>Background : - Insulin receptor mutation cause high blood sugar sometimes diabetes complication . Researchers want see thyroid hormone help . Objectives : - To see thyroid hormone treatment change body handle sugar people insulin receptor mutation improve blood sugar people diabetes . Eligibility : - People age 12 65 insulin receptor mutation . Design : - Study part 1:19-day clinic stay . Participants monitor 4 day . Then 15 day take thyroid hormone pill 3 time day . Participants : - Blood test . - Heart rate skin temperature monitor . - All food provide . - Two 5-hour session special room . They wear special clothes sometimes sit still . - Two small tube insert vein . One deliver tiny amount sugar fat non-radioactive tracer . Participants also drink water tracer . The tube collect blood . - A sweet drink . Participants may finger stick blood sugar test . - Glucose-monitoring device insert body fat two 24-hour period . - Adults may sample fat muscle take . - Heart ultrasound . - PET-CT scan machine . An intravenous catheter place arm vein . A small amount radioactive substance inject . - DEXA scan body fat bone density . - Participants poorly control diabetes take thyroid hormone home 6 month . They blood drawn sent study team monthly . - After 3 month , overnight visit . After 6 month , 4-day visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thyroid Hormone Induce Non-Insulin Mediated Glucose Disposal People With Insulin Receptor Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients mutation insulin receptor extreme insulin resistance . This frequently result diabetes childhood extremely difficult manage conventional diabetes therapy , include insulin dose 10-50 fold high usual . Poorly control diabetes , tum , lead microvascular complication ( e.g . blindness ) early death . Hyperthyroidism , whether endogenous ( e.g . Graves ' disease ) exogenous , increase energy expenditure , activate brown adipose tissue , enhance skeletal muscle perfusion , lead enhance glucose disposal . In single patient mutation insulin receptor poorly control diabetes despite maximal therapy , iatrogenic mild hyperthyroidism treatment thyroid cancer result normalization glycemia control , suggest thyroid hormone treatment could therapeutic benefit rare disease . Aim The purpose ofthis study determine treatment thyroid hormone increase glucose disposal patient mutation ofthe insulin receptor , thereby improve glycemia control . The hypothesis test : 1 . Thyroid hormone increase whole-body glucose disposal patient insulin receptor mutation . 2 . This increase glucose disposal mediate via increase glucose uptake BAT muscle . 3 . Increases glucose disposal result improve glycemia control . Methods This study non-randomized pre-post design , conduct two sequential part . Part 1 short-term ( 2 week ) proof-of-principle study test whether thyroid hormone increase glucose disposal patient insulin receptor mutation ( without diabetes ) , mechanism increase glucose disposal occurs . Part 2 long term ( 6 month ) therapeutic study test whether thyroid hormone result improve glycemia control diabetic patient insulin receptor mutation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>2 WEEKS STUDY : INCLUSION CRITRIA : 1 . Mutation insulin receptor ( either recessive dominant negative ) . If mutation status know prior enrollment , subject undergo genotyping enrollment . In unanticipated event patient mutation insulin receptor , complete study data include analysis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Changes dose diabetes medication ( include metformin , insulin , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones , leptin , GLP1 agonists , DPP4 inhibitor , etc . ) precede 10 week . 2 . Any medical condition medication increase risk subject ( e.g . ischemic structural heart disease , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , arrhythmia ) interfere interpretation study data . 3 . Disorders would lead erratic gastrointestinal absorption loss thyroid hormone gut ( severe diarrhea , celiac disease , use bile acid sequestrants , excessive consumption soybean product ) . 4 . Any form endogenous hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism baseline . 5 . Current recent ( past 8 week ) use thyroid hormone antithyroid drug . 6 . Extreme disorder thyroid hormone binding thyroid bind globulin ( excess deficiency ) protein loss ( nephrotic range proteinuria ) would lead difficulty achieve consistent thyroid hormone level study . 7 . Known presence rare clinical disorder lead thyroid hormone insensitivity ( know T3 receptor mutation , selenocysteine insertion sequencebinding protein 2 ( SBP2 ) abnormality , monocarboxylate transporter defect ) . 8 . Current use beta blocker 9 . Pregnancy breast feed 10 . Any EKG abnormality could increase risk T3 treatment ( rest sinus tachycardia ( age adjust norm ) , atrial fibrillation , myocardial ischemia , leave right ventricular excitation block , leave ventricular hypertrophy extrasystole ) 11 . Known allergy hypersensitivity form thyroid hormone 12 . Known adrenal insufficiency 13 . Dependence oral anticoagulant medication ( adult ) 14 . Use tricyclic antidepressant , transient cardiac arrhythmia observe concomitant use thyroid hormone . 15 . Use cholestyramine . 16 . History clinically significant osteoporosis per investigator judgment ( e.g . previous fragility fracture ) 6 MONTHS STUDY : Patients must meet inclusion exclusion criterion shortterm study , plus poorly control diabetes , define hemoglobin A1c great equal 7 % .</criteria>
