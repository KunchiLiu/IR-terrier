	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) epidemic age prevalence HF steadily increase population old adult expands . Despite fact age always stand leading risk factor HF incidence well poor HF prognosis , HF trial focus specifically age physiology key determinant disease , and/or utility target mechanism associate age beneficial therapeutic target . Consistently , HF trial tend focus primarily central mechanism cardiac pump dysfunction despite fact HF-outcomes strongly relate functional decrement largely mediate peripheral manifestation disease , particularly interrelate age physiology . HF-related skeletal muscle myopathy manifestation HF diminish physical function , likely exacerbate sarcopenia , vascular stiffening , aspect age exercise intolerance disproportionate among old HF population well insidious clinical implication . In pilot investigation , investigator study old ( age ≥70 year ) adult , include patient HF reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) HF preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) age-matched healthy control , study benefit nitrite therapy ( addition establish standard HF care ) improve physical function . In pilot analysis investigator focus utility daily nitrite supplement moderate aerobic ( maximal submaximal ) strength ( maximal , endurance , power ) indices well underlying skeletal muscle mechanism ( skeletal muscle mitochondrial performance , gene expression , capillarity ) . Atrophy type 1 skeletal muscle myocytes associate HFrEF HFpEF . Multiple study normal age also demonstrate typical atrophy type 2 skeletal muscle fiber . Consistently , old adult compromise cumulative atrophy risk , study show loss lean body mass well intrinsic skeletal muscle weakening , increase interstitial fat , increase inflammation , associate functional decrement fatigue . While aerobic strength exercise training may use modify HF-related muscle pattern , deconditioning remains pervasive among old HF patient , effort promote exercise intervention typically confound comorbidity ( e.g . arthritis , peripheral arterial disease , diabetes , depression ) , geriatric syndrome ( e.g. , fall , frailty , incontinence , dementia , poor sleep , malnutrition , auditory vision impairment ) , well pain , anxiety , logistic limitation . Even major exercise-training trial provide strong reinforcement ensure requisite behavioral change yield poor exercise adherence . There high conceptual rationale therapy intrinsically improve skeletal muscle performance HF vital mean improve physical function moderate effect disease well frailty enfeeblement associate disease . This potentially improve efficacy quality care , also potentially mitigate skyrocketing cost associated aggregate HF management . Studies demonstrate nitrate therapy increase adenosine triphospate ( ATP ) synthesis skeletal muscle mitochondrion concomitant reduce whole-body oxygen cost steady state exercise . Our work demonstrate safety efficacy FDA-IND approve sodium nitrite ( 10 mg ) capsule , utility upregulate SIRT3-AMP pathway skeletal muscle young HF patient . It seem exceptionally logical opportune apply insight old HF patient delineate mechanisms disease age respond nitrite therapy . Overall aim : 1 . To demonstrate oral nitrite pill provide skeletal muscle physiological benefit old HFrEF HFpEF patient : - To show oral supplement manifest increase plasma nitrite . - To show increased plasma nitrite associate improved skeletal muscle ( mitochondrial respirometry ) platelet ( Seahorse XF ) metabolism . - To demonstrate improved metabolism associate shifts skeletal muscle anabolic gene expression ( Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 [ FNDC5 ] , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator [ PGC1α ] , Sirtuin 3 ) well reduce catabolic gene expression ( ubiquitin , muscle RING-Finger Protein [ MuRF ] , Atrogin1 ] ) inflammation ( Tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNFα ] , Interleukin 1beta ( IL-1β ) , Interleukin six ( IL-6 ) . 2 . To demonstrate improved skeletal physiology achieve use oral nitrate pill associate improved clinical index old HFrEF HFpEF patient : - To show oral nitrite supplement increase efficiency work , i.e. , reduce oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) require work intensity .</detailed_description>
