	<brief_summary>Chemobrain expression use describe cluster chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment symptom , include problem visual verbal memory , forgetfulness , difficulty learning , attention , concentration coordination multitasking organization . Over 75 % cancer patient experience acute cognitive symptom chemotherapy 17 % -34 % long-term post-treatment cognitive deficit persist 10 year . Breast cancer survivor even display high 50 % -75 % prevalence post-treatment cognitive impairment . Chemobrain become apparent quality-of-life issue cancer survivor encounter frequently rise number cancer survivor . There effective intervention available prevent treat chemobrain . Acupuncture beneficial reduce various side effect anti-cancer treatment . It also show efficacy improve mild cognitive impairment dementia disorder ; facilitate recovery pathological microstructural change brain . These result lead hypothesis acupuncture effective preventing chemobrain preventive effect may associate protection cytokine production , epigenetic modification microstructural change brain . To test hypothesis , assessor-blinded , randomise control trial conduct determine combination DCEAS body acupuncture could reduce incidence symptom chemobrain breast cancer patient chemotherapy compare least acupuncture stimulation ( LAS ) control . A total 168 breast cancer patient ready chemotherapy randomly assign comprehensive acupuncture intervention ( combine DCEAS body acupuncture regimen + chemotherapy ) ( CAI ) ( n = 84 ) 2 session per week 8 week least acupuncture stimulation ( LAS ) ( minimal acupuncture + chemotherapy ) ( n = 84 ) . All patient receive standard chemotherapy breast cancer . Treatment outcomes cognitive performance , fatigue depression assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although development various chemotherapeutic drug greatly improve clinical outcome survival rate cancer patient , also cause various adverse side effect . Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment , often refer chemobrain , drawn increase attention due rise number cancer survivor past decade . Numerous study show chemotherapy cause acute long-term post-treatment cognitive impairment , include problem visual verbal memory , forgetfulness , difficulty learning , attention , concentration coordination multitasking organization . Over 75 % cancer patient report experience acute cognitive symptom chemotherapy 17 % -34 % long-term post-treatment cognitive deficit persist 10 year . Breast cancer survivor may display high prevalence post-treatment cognitive impairment . The severity report chemobrain symptom variable , subtle severe . Chemobrain become apparent quality-of-life issue survivor encounter frequency future . However , effective intervention available prevent treat chemobrain , although pharmacological , antioxidant various cognitive approach test . It believe chemobrain consequence brain neuronal injury induce systemically administer chemotherapeutic agent via direct indirect mechanism , result suppression neuronal cell proliferation , epigenetic modification microstructural change brain . These pathological circumstance largely developed alternation cytokine milieu . While physical psychological stressor cancer patient experience diagnosis , chemotherapy long-term follow-up show increase circulate cytokine level increase cytokine level associate cognitive decline cancer patient , administration chemotherapy also result cytokine production peripheral central level medication induce tumor cell death collateral tissue injury . Patients undergoing chemotherapy find display significant increase multiple cytokine . A large body evidence well confirm acupuncture effective reduce anti-cancer treatment-caused side effect , include pain , nausea , hot flash , fatigue , xerostomia , anxiety , depression sleep disturbance . Numerous study show effectiveness acupuncture therapy improve cognitive function patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) various dementia . The reduced severity cognitive symptom associate neuroimaging improvement brain region associate learn memory process . Acupuncture also ameliorate cognitive impairment various animal model . Studies reveal cognition-improving effect acupuncture associate inhibition cytokine-mediated neuronal cell apoptosis , inflammatory reaction oxidative cellular injury effect reduce cognitive symptom relate protection neuronal cell , improvement electrophysiological activity hippocampus brain cell proliferation . Moreover , acupuncture also display significant effect facilitate recovery brain microstructural histopathological level patient cerebral infarction rat transient focal cerebral ischemia . The investigator therefore hypothesize acupuncture may also effective prevent reduce chemotherapy cause cognitive impairment . Recently , investigator develop novel acupuncture stimulation call dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation ( DCEAS ) basis neuroanatomical rationale . In mode , electrical stimulation deliver dense acupoints locate forehead innervated trigeminal nerve . The trigeminal sensory pathway much intimate fiber connection brain region associate sensory , locomotor , visceral function , sleep , emotion , learn memory . Therefore , DCEAS effectively modulate brain function . Over past 5 year , investigator complete several clinical study demonstrate benefit DCEAS treatment major depression , insomnia , OCD , postpartum depression post-stroke depression . In proposed study , combination DCEAS body acupuncture employ prevent treat chemobrain breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
