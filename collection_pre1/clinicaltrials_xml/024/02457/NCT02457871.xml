	<detailed_description>Health outcome chronically ill low-income adult costly fiscal human term . Although advance make understanding nurse case management ( NCM ) contribute self-management ( SM ) behavior , factor contribute sustain SM behavior low-income African American population well understood . This study examine impact Ecological Nurse Case Management ( ENCM ) self-management behavior , health status , self-efficacy poor , chronically ill , African American adult . In addition , explore moderate effect determine ENCM intervention differentially effective base gender perceive stress . The study use UWM Automated Community Health Information System , relational electronic health record , document individualize ECNM intervention dose intervention . The specific study aim : 1 ) examine difference ENCM treat group comparison group self-efficacy , SM behavior , health status establish effect size need future large randomize controlled trial ; 2 ) explore dose-response specific element ENCM intervention ; 3 ) examine moderate effect gender perceive stress intervention effect . This two-group randomized experimental study repeat measurement . Clients treatment group ( n=25 ) receive individualize ENCM comparison group ( n=25 ) receive usual clinic care . Data collect baseline , 1 , 3 , 6 month capture immediate , short long term effect intervention . Acknowledging small sample size , mixed model repeat measure data ( baseline M1 , 3 , 6 post-intervention ) fit interaction involve moderate variable gender stress . The ENCM intervention draw evidence give proper tool ( i.e. , knowledge , skill support ) , individual learn good self-manage symptom day day basis well utilize health care resource available .</detailed_description>
