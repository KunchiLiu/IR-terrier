	<brief_summary>The purpose Traditions study examine influence cultural immersion willingness try fruit vegetable among child , 3-12 , Guam . The primary objective study examine willingness try fruit vegetable fruit vegetable intake among child attend three exist summer camp program : cultural immersion camp , university day camp , recreational sport camp . The primary hypothesis child attend cultural immersion camp would higher willingness try fruit vegetable ( WillTry score ) high intake fruit vegetable compare child attend , university day camp recreational sport camp , without cultural immersion . A pre-post , quasi-experimental design use evaluate 3 summer camp different exposure level cultural immersion . High , moderate , zero ( cultural ) exposure provide cultural immersion camp ( CIC ) , university-based day camp ( UDC ) , recreational sport camp ( RSC ) , respectively . CIC deliver 4 culturally adapt nutrition lesson within context Chamorro cultural tradition part cultural immersion camp activity . The UDC deliver lesson within physiology framework . The RSC without nutrition lesson cultural immersion . Children 3-12 year old register three summer camp program eligible participate . Data collection primarily administer two assessment period : ( ± 2 week ) ( ± 1 week ) summer camp program . Children 's willingness try fruit vegetable , primary outcome , assess interview-administered Adapted WillTry tool . The secondary outcome fruit vegetable intake servings/day CIC UDC . Fruit vegetable intake assess use mobile food record ( mFR ) , app run iPod Touch base technology assist dietary assessment ( TADA ) protocols . Outcomes examine Adapted WillTry post-scores local novel local common fruit vegetable fruit vegetable servings/day use multivariate regression model adjust relevant pre-score , sex , age , ethnicity , dose , BMI percentile , parent 's cultural affiliation . Therefore , additional measure like sociodemographic information , anthropometry ( i.e . height weight ) , parent 's cultural affiliation collect account potential confounders .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Cultural Immersion Willingness Try Fruits Vegetables Among Children Guam : Traditions Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pre-post quasi-experimental design use observe outcome ( i.e. , willingness try FV FV intake ) three exist summer camp program Guam : cultural immersion camp ( CIC ) , university day camp ( UDC ) , recreational sport camp ( RSC ) . This natural-setting , multi-arm parallel design use alternative resource intensive infrastructure organization willing incorporate activity answer research question . The CIC UDC program nearly match daily activity ( e.g. , physical activity , cook demonstrations/taste testing , craft ) . The four Traditions lesson ( Figure 1 ) incorporate CIC UDC deliver educator . These lesson feature local FV promote positive association eat FV . In CIC , context Chamorro cultural tradition , practice , value tie FV . Chamorro language , culture , ethnicity Guam Marianas . In UDC , consume healthy food introduce within context nutrition human physiology . The four lesson adapt permission culturally-relevant Hawaiʻian nutrition curriculum make relevant Guam Chamorro culture . This curriculum complement Hawaiʻi Guam Department Education K-12 Content Performance Standards . The CIC activity perpetuate Chamorro culture language song/chanting , dance , prayer , art craft , cooking , outdoor activity , garden base traditional contemporary practice . Chamorro speak 80 % time , include delivery key message Traditions lesson . All activity operate indigenous value respect , love , humility , reciprocity , camaraderie . The UDC activity focus promote healthful present-day recreational activity global food . The activity extension Expanded Food Nutrition Education Program mission . RSC exclusively physical activity . Upon completion last assessment , educator provide one Traditions lesson registrant RSC . Data collection occur two assessment period : ( ± 2 week ) ( ± 1 week ) program . The first assessment complete camp setting . The second also complete camp pre-arranged location , child 's home child-friendly public space ( e.g. , mall ) . Children complete interview-administered Adapted WillTry tool , measure child 's willingness try FV previously validate child 3-11 year old Guam . FV intake assess use mobile food record ( mFR ) . The mFR app show useful method dietary assessment adolescent . Only participants CIC UDC ask use mFR due limit number iPods . Other Measures : Parents complete questionnaire include information child 's age , sex , language speak , religion , birthplace . Parent 's cultural affiliation determine use response report cultural affiliation questionnaire , assess one four mode acculturation : traditional , integrate , assimilate , marginalize . The scoring system use describe Kaholokula others . Anthropometric assessment complete time designate least disruptive camp activity . Height weight measure use portable Seca scale stadiometer ( PE-AIM 101 ) use centimeter kilogram , respectively . These measurement convert body mass index ( BMI ) [ kg/ ( height , ) 2 ] . Dose assess record attendance camp Traditions lesson . For participation , child give gift card , $ 5 $ 10 denomination , one one camp assessment . Remuneration vary due different type lengths involvement participant depend camp program . Sample size determine use estimate Adapted WillTry local novel local common FV score data represent child similar child recruit study . The main outcome , model 1 model 2 power 0.8 minimum detectable difference ( MDD ) 0.43 local novel score 0.41 local common score correspond propose sample size n=60 CIC , n=30 UDC , n=30 RSC . For Model 3 , base UDC RSC sample size MDD 0.49 0.47 local novel local common , respectively . For secondary outcome , post-FV intake , MDDs 0.877 , 0.3132 , 0.6265 per day dependent baseline FV consumption 2 , 1 1.5 yielded sample size CIC ( n=60 ) UDC ( n=30 ) . Data enter use Microsoft Access ( Microsoft Corp ) tool specifically design study . Double-data entry procedure use PROC COMPARE SAS 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Inc. ) perform data entry achieve 100 % matching . A trained analyst examine image , identify whole FV ( e.g. , FV mixed dish , fruit , vegetable ) , amount consume . FV ( 100 % ) juice exclude . FV intake calculate divide total FV total number day eat occasion capture use mFR . Categorical variable examine use frequency quantitative variable mean standard deviation use . Differences camp Adapted WillTry FV post-scores ( i.e . local novel , local common , import ) examine use univariate ANOVA adjust pre-scores . To examine previously observe incremental trend Adapted WillTry FV score , score statistically significantly different one another , pair t-tests pre- post-assessment score camp perform . Analytical analysis conduct use IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 ( IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY ) . Potential confounders include model use indicator variable age ( i.e. , 3-6y , 7-8y , 9-12y ) , ethnicity ( i.e. , Chamorro , Chamorro Mixed , Other ) , sex . Categories parent 's cultural affiliation analyze traditional integrated . In model , child whose parent categorize marginalize ( n=2 ) assimilate ( n=1 ) eliminate due small number . Lesson camp attendance dose CIC UDC calculate use sum day participant attend lesson camp day divide total possible lesson camp day , respectively . A dichotomous variable create high low dose use 50th percentile cut-point lesson camp dose . BMI model continuous variable . To examine primary hypothesis , indicator variable create camp relevant comparison Models 1 , 2 , 3 . Multiple linear regression model three Adapted WillTry post-scores ( dependent variable ) fit separately examine whether much Adapted WillTry score differed camp program accounting potential confounders ( i.e. , pre-scores , participant 's age , sex , ethnicity , BMI , parent 's cultural affiliation , lesson camp day dose ) . The final model include Adapted WillTry pre-scores , sex , age , ethnicity . For whole FV intake , multiple linear regression model use examine difference post-FV intake/day ( dependent variable ) UDC CIC . The final model include pre-FV intake/day , age , ethnicity , parent 's cultural affiliation ( independent variable ) .</detailed_description>
