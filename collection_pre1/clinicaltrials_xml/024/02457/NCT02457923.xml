	<detailed_description>. Study design : Using community-based , cluster randomize controlled trial design ( cRCT ) investigator examine impact integrate `` m-health package - ( M- SAKHI ) mother appropriate infant feeding practice , start first / second trimester pregnancy one year delivery , improve child feed practice child growth , reduce prevalence undernutrition child . This result two treatment group ( see diagram ) . The cluster trial village administrative area ASHAs . Villages population 1000- 2000 ( range 751 2000 ) single ASHA randomize receive either intervention ( intervention village ) continue exist delivery care ( control villages ) . Selecting single village per ASHA criterion reduce chance contamination study group . The data collect use longitudinal design investigator want study impact intervention mother start pregnancy infant 24 month old . This preferred cross sectional design reduce impact due migration mother cluster , may receive intervention plan . Cross sectional survey well suit intervention design use . Lastly on-going government program contaminate intervention before-after cross section design . However CRCT , government program present study control cluster , additional impact intervention evaluate . Additionally , growth velocity development infant whose mother receive intervention also evaluate use longitudinal design . This design control potential confounding factor ( Observed unobserved ) adequate number cluster ( 292 village ) randomly allocate treatment group . This random allocation treatment villages reduce selection bias would arise good perform PHCs favorable local condition purposely select . Contamination intervention constrain administrative geographic separation village , buffer area . The outcome assessment make field research officer ( FROs ) cohort 2,728 mother-infant dyad ( 1,364 treatment group ) measure baseline follow visit . There follow-up assessment every trimester pregnancy every month birth child 12 month age , every three 6 month till 24 month . Three assessment ( infant 15,18 &amp; 24 month ) make education intervention cease order ass sustain impact prevalence child stunt infant feeding practice ( see evaluation plan detail ) . The investigator expect likely high correlation baseline follow outcome measure , low loss follow , thus make approach efficient study design . In cRCT intervention allocate community level , outcome assessment individual level . This best comparative design propose intervention , deliver individual mother would likely lead contamination intervention densely populated rural village community . The proposed field area centrally locate village catchment area Indian Government , PHC 3 district ( Nagpur , Bhandara Wardha ) eastern Maharashtra ( see Map ) .There around 28 PHCs.Each Primary Health Centre ( PHC ) cover average population 30,000 average 30 village . The administrative area ASHA villages population 1000-200 ( range 751 2000 ) . As per investigator ' experience Maternal Neonatal Health ( MNH ) Registry , Crude Birth Rate ( CBR ) study area 16.4 per 1000 population , thus expect projected number ante-natal case ( ANC ) per thousand population would 18 per year consider 10 per cent pregnancy wastage . At give point time , 60 per cent ANCs ( 11 ) available per thousand population , 6 20 week gestation . An additional 6 register next 3 month enrollment period . Using standard formula , sample size require would 2,728 mother-infant pair ( 1,364 per group ) 292 cluster .This sample would provide 90 % power detect 15 % relative reduction stunt . Based prior experience investigator estimate account probable case loss follow-up delivery outside study area , 70 percent ANCs would available inclusion study . Thus 8 ANCs per 1000 population would available inclusion study population 341000 need covered get require number ( 2728 ) subject . The unit randomization ASHA provide service village average population 1000-2000 ( range 751 - 2000 ) person . Using computerized random number generator investigator randomize 146 ASHA ( 1 ASHA per village ) deliver service pregnant woman till infant 12 month use M-SAKHI intervention addition exit service ( intervention group ) , , 146 control group i.e routine provision service exist level service delivery ( uniform allocation ) , across geographic area . The random allocation sequence generate use StataÂ® software . All effort make enroll woman first / second trimester ( 20 week gestation ) . In arm , encourage woman enroll early possible , eligible couple identify ASHA incentivized home pregnancy test kit , could report soon miss period . The average expected number birth population cover 292 village PHCs 12 month would 3000 , would require trial recruitment , thus confirm feasibility sample scheme .</detailed_description>
