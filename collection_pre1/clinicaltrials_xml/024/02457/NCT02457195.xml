	<detailed_description>Patients recruit surgical population undergo preoperative evaluation Anesthesiology Preoperative Evaluation Clinic Hershey Med . Ctr . ( ~15,000 per year ) . Selected patient ( ASA 1-3 , N=60 ) history severe PONV one previous general anesthesia , schedule undergo surgical procedure general anesthesia enrol IRB approve protocol . The patch place patient home 24 - 48 hour surgery direct doctor . The subsequent standardized general anesthesia protocol elective surgery include general endotracheal anesthesia sevofluran , include standard intraoperative PONV prophylaxis ( IV dexamethasone IV ondansetron , 4 mg ) . Postoperative evaluation include record incidence severity PONV time discharge PACU ( acute PONV ) , 24 hr , 48 hr , 72 120 hr ( delay post discharge PONV ) . 7.2.1 Visit 1 - Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic recruitment drug dispensation Patient see clinic identified history serious PONV , particular delay post discharge PONV . Study explain patient consent obtain . The investigational pharmacy notify study patient enrol prepare patch distribution patient . A member research team obtain assigned patch investigational pharmacy deliver anesthesia provider ( member research team ) . The provider demonstrate patient apply patch patient practice use placebo patch show correct placement . Patient take actual patch home . 7.2.2 Visit 2 - approximately 24-48 hour preoperatively ( patient 's home ) Patient apply patch upper arm 24-48 hour schedule surgical procedure , instruct pre-op anesthesia visit . The patch remain place 120 hour surgical procedure . No backup patch provide patient accidently miss patch need call primary surgical service standard antiemetic medication . 7.2.3 Visit 3- Day Surgery Patient arrive surgery . A member research team meet SDU record time patch apply , place correctly , intact still place . Any potential side effect ( systemic local ) record time . The subsequent standardized general anesthesia protocol elective surgery include general endotracheal anesthesia sevofluran ( nitrous oxide ) , muscle relaxant ( reversal ) , intraoperative IV opioid analgesic , include standard PONV prophylaxis ( dexamethasone ondansetron IV 4 mg ) . Early postoperative evaluation include record incidence severity PONV time discharge PACU ( acute PONV ) . The incidence vomit retch recorded nursing staff . Patients symptoms require rescue antiemetic—nausea score ≥4 11-point Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) , retch vomiting , patient request—within 6 hour PACU admission give rescue medication ( Benadryl promethazine ) . The NRS 11-point linear scale patient rat nausea , 0 meaning nausea 10 meaning worst possible nausea . The subsequent evaluation perform either patient 's bed ( hospital ) phone call 24 hr , 48 hr , 72 120 hr ( delay post discharge PONV ) . The patient supply diary record information request follow-up phone call . The primary efficacy endpoint complete response ( CR ) , define emetic episode rescue medication ; proportion patient emesis additional rescue medication 120 hour follow completion surgical procedure change baseline nausea score use NRS . Treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAEs ) , regardless suspect causal relationship study medication , also record throughout continued 5 day surgery . 7.3 Duration Participation Patient remain study time point meet ( maximum 5 day follow surgery 120 hour ) . At end study patient remove dispose remain patch .</detailed_description>
