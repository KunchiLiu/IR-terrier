	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective interventional study ass whether adjunctive verteporfin photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) effective treatment persistent disease activity neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( NV AMD ) , compare anti-VEGF therapy ( aflibercept ) alone . This study enroll individual NV AMD persistent disease activity spite either load dose ( initial 3-5 anti-VEGF treatment ) maintenance ( establish course ) anti-VEGF therapy determine whether PDT improve disease activity , facilitate sustain visual acuity gain , decrease burden frequent anti-VEGF treatment affect patient . Risks study relate treatment study drug : intravenous verteporfin , intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide , intravitreal aflibercept . All study extensively clinical trial establish treatment use routinely NV AMD . Adverse event monitor principal investigator study team .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( NV AMD ) remain leading cause vision loss among people 65 . Intravitreal injection drug block vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , major protein mediator angiogenesis vascular leakage , revolutionize treatment NV AMD . This class drug include FDA-approved medication ranibizumab ( Lucentis ® , Genentech ) aflibercept ( Eylea ® , Regeneron ) , well bevacizumab ( Avastin ® , Genentech ) , FDA-approved treatment NV AMD use off-label demonstrated clinical efficacy . However , therapy cure . Even effective , vast majority NV AMD patient require continued treatment anti-VEGF drug indefinitely rest life , sustain stable visual acuity . Further , spite continuous monthly anti-VEGF therapy , 40-50 % patient demonstrate persistent disease activity ( PDA ) . Patients persistent disease activity spite ongoing anti-VEGF therapy remain increase risk long-term vision loss . Persistent disease activity define ( 1 ) unresolved intraretinal , subretinal , sub-retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) fluid exudation ; ( 2 ) progressive lesion enlargement fibrosis ; and/or ( 3 ) persistent new hemorrhage . Several large , multicenter , prospective clinical trial demonstrate ~75 % rate PDA follow load dose therapy ( i.e . three consecutive monthly injection ) , ~ 40-50 % PDA follow one year continue anti-VEGF therapy . The treatment burden sustain visual acuity patient PDA especially high , since undertreatment cessation therapy assure visual decline . The PIER study assess efficacy quarterly ( i.e . every-three-months ) anti-VEGF therapy ranibizumab , follow initiation load dose therapy . Patients resolution disease activity follow load dose maintain visual acuity gain subsequent quarterly therapy . In contrast , patient PDA follow load dose progressive loss visual acuity gain switch subsequent quarterly therapy . Several subsequent clinical trial ( CATT , IVAN , others ) demonstrate patient PDA typically require continue monthly therapy sustain improve visual acuity . Though `` do-able '' short term , indefinite long-term therapy monthly injection often impractical patient retina physician , result , undertreatment occurs high frequency . Verteporfin ( Visudyne ® , Bausch + Lomb ) PDT FDA-approved treatment NV AMD initially approve 10 year ago , prior advent anti-VEGF therapy . As first-line therapy , verteporfin PDT much less effective anti-VEGF therapy improve vision NV AMD patient . PDT study adjunctive therapy previously treatment-naïve patient receive anti-VEGF therapy . It find offer significant visual acuity benefit anti-VEGF therapy alone , population . However , unknown whether adjunctive PDT may effective improve treatment response patient PDA spite anti-VEGF therapy . The investigator perform several retrospective study NV AMD patient Duke Medical Retina practice ass role adjunctive PDT case PDA . Preliminary result indicate adjunctive verteporfin PDT reduce disease activity ( i.e . decrease fluid exudation ) patient PDA , facilitate treatment few anti-VEGF injection ( i.e . reduces treatment burden ) , reduce risk subsequent vision loss . However , study prospectively evaluate efficacy adjunctive PDT patient PDA spite anti-VEGF therapy . The present study ass efficacy adjunctive PDT treatment PDA NV AMD . The investigator compare administration anti-VEGF therapy adjunctive PDT standard-of-care treatment approach , anti-VEGF monotherapy administer accord `` treat-and-extend '' approach , interval intravitreal injection short every 1 month ( approximately 4 week ) gradually lengthen long interval treatment ensure disease quiescence .</detailed_description>
