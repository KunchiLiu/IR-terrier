	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study ReLeaf Catheter System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ReLeaf catheter system intend creation tissue leaflets deep vein exist valve structure longer healthy effectively move blood . This study aim treat subject document history symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency compression therapy least 6 month , combine superficial venous and/or perforator surgery fail obtain clinical improvement . This clinical trial design evaluate safety technical feasibility ReLeaf Catheter System creation one tissue leaflets femoral and/or popliteal vein subject chronic venous insufficiency meet protocol entry criterion .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Venous Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>History symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency subject , clinical category CEAP 3 great . History fail compression therapy ( least 6 month ) , combine superficial venous perforator surgery . Femoral and/or popliteal venous reflux â‰¥ 1.0 second . Deep system reflux Kistner classification grade 2 high . 18 year age old time consent . Willing able sign Ethics Committee ( EC ) approve informed consent form . Willing comply followup evaluation protocol . In Investigator 's opinion , venous outflow obstruction would inhibit adequate flow away valve site . Obstructive feature femoral popliteal vein propose tissue leaflet creation site , , Investigator 's opinion , allow sufficient blood flow tissue leaflet creation site . Deep venous system intervention within 6 month consent . Obstructive feature irregularly small luminal diameter femoral vein , opinion Investigator , prohibit access tissue leaflet creation site . Prior deep vein valve surgical intervention ipsilateral limb . Ankle arthrodesis secondary muscle atrophy severely limited ambulation . Limbthreatening circulatory compromise . Contraindications anticoagulation therapy medically control . History symptomatic pulmonary embolism . Acute venous thromboembolism within 3 month consent . Comorbidity risk , opinion Investigator , limit longevity likelihood comply protocol follow . General contraindication surgery use anesthesia . Uncontrolled heart failure , NYHA Class III IV heart failure . Open Cardiac surgery ( e.g . ventriculotomy , atriotomy ) within past 6 month consent ( Interventional procedure stenting PTCA apply . ) Chronic Kidney Disease creatinine level 2mg/dL high . Active systemic infection sepsis . Pregnant lactating ( positive pregnancy test , woman childbearing potential must test ) . Appropriate vascular access preclude . Subject enrol clinical study , opinion Investigator , may conflict study compromise study result . Subject consider high risk noncompliance protocol ( e.g. , inaccessible followup ) . Other invasive surgical procedure within last 90 day Investigator 's opinion would interfere study procedure result . History stroke within last 6 month . Subject incarcerate incarcerated course study . Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence</criteria>
