	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-blind , randomize study evaluate intravitreal aflibercept injection ( IAI ) versus sham prophylaxis conversion neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) `` high-risk '' subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IAI Versus Sham Prophylaxis Against Conversion Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>128 subject enrol trial randomize 1:1 ratio receive either IAI every three month 24 month sham injection . Enrollment stratify order ensure balance two treatment group subject diagnose exudative AMD within past two year versus diagnose two year prior Baseline . Study assessment conduct required visit every three month include manifest refraction ETDRS visual acuity testing , slit lamp exam dilate fundus exam , spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) use Avanti device , OCT angiography use Avanti AngioVueTM , fluorescein angiography . Fundus photography also perform Baseline , Month 12 Month 24 visit . In event conversion neovascular AMD study eye point study , Investigator treat subject IAI frequency per his/her discretion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study eye must diagnosis nonexudative agerelated degeneration characterize presence many intermediate size drusen , 1 large drusen , and/or hyperpigmentary change . Fellow ( nonstudy ) eye must CNV lesion ( i.e. , leakage fluorescein angiography and/or subretinal , intraretinal , subRPE fluid OCT ) secondary agerelated macular degeneration OR history CNV lesion secondary agerelated macular degeneration , confirm current past treatment current past diagnostic imaging . Subject must willing able comply clinic visit studyrelated procedure . Subject must provide sign informed consent . Subject must able understand complete studyrelated questionnaire . In order participate home monitoring substudy , subject must approve wireless device ( i.e . iPhone , iPad , iPod run iOS 6.0 later ) willing use loan device access wireless Internet connection duration study . Evidence neovascular AMD study eye time enrollment anytime past . The reading center must confirm evidence neovascular AMD study eye prior enrollment . Serous PED size study eye , determine reading center . Previous treatment verteporfin PDT , antiVEGF therapy , laser , external beam radiation AMD therapy study eye . History macular hole study eye . History vitrectomy study eye . Lens extraction implantation within last 3 month . Capsulotomy within last 1 month . Lens medium opacity would preclude good fundus photography angiography within next 2 year . Macular edema sign diabetic retinopathy severe 10 red dot ( microaneurysms blot hemorrhage ) . Retinal change relate high myopia and/or myopic correction great 8.00 diopter spherical equivalent . Any progressive ocular disease would affect visual acuity within next 2 year . Previous participation study investigational drug likely ocular effect within 30 day precede initial study treatment . Concurrent use systemic antiVEGF agent . Active recent ( within 4 week ) intraocular inflammation ( grade trace ) study eye . Active infectious conjunctivitis , keratitis , scleritis , endophthalmitis either eye . For subject undergone prior refractive cataract surgery study eye , preoperative refractive error study eye exceed 8 diopter myopia . Uncontrolled glaucoma study eye ( defined intraocular pressure great 25 mmHg ) despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) . Subjects unable photographed document CNV due know allergy fluorescein dye , lack venous access cataract obscure CNV . Subjects ocular disease compromise visual acuity study eye amblyopia anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . Current treatment active systemic infection . Evidence significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases cardiovascular disease , nervous system , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , endocrine , gastrointestinal disorder . History recurrent significant infection bacterial infection . Inability comply study followup procedure . Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation</criteria>
