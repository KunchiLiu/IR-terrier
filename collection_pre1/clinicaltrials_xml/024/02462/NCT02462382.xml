	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair common painful procedure routinely perform outpatient basis . Postoperative pain control regimens include narcotic pain medicine , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication regional anesthesia interscalene block ( ISB ) . Regional block ISB safely provide complete pain relief shoulder upper extremity eight twelve hours1 . However , shoulder still painful block wear . The purpose study : 1 . Examine efficacy continuous infusion scalene block ropivacaine catheter first two day arthroscopic rotator cuff repair . 2 . Examine narcotic consumption continuous infusion scalene block ropivacaine placebo catheter arthroscopic rotator cuff repair . 3 . Evaluate continue pain relief benefit continuous infusion scalene block ropivacaine catheter three day infusion catheter finish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair one three attend surgeon author Orlando Orthopaedic Outpatient Surgery Center candidate study . Further inclusion criterion full-thickness rotator cuff tear , age eighteen great , reparable rotator cuff tear willingness consent study participation . Patients exclude concomitant procedure acromioplasty , distal clavicle resection , biceps tenotomy biceps tenodesis . Exclusion criterion include age less eighteen , irreparable rotator cuff tear , subscapularis tear require repair , labral tear require repair , allergy ropivacaine similar local anesthetic agent allergy oxycodone . All patient undergo ultrasound guide ISB 30cc 0.5 % ropivacaine epinephrine preoperative hold area anesthesiologist train regional block anesthesia . A continuous infusion catheter place ultrasound guidance confirm appropriate position . An adhesive dressing skin use keep catheter position away operate field . All patient receive reservoir catheter contain 280cc either ropivacaine saline infuse rate 6cc per hour . The reservoir attach operating room completion rotator cuff repair . Patients randomize intraoperative receive either ropivacaine saline . Randomization perform block number randomization group assignment place sealed envelope . The envelope open operate room circulate nurse . Both patient surgeon blind randomization . Patients family educate preoperative postoperative removal pain catheter . There write instruction regard catheter removal . Patients family member remove catheter reservoirs empty . The study author available assist catheter removal issue patient may . Patients prescribe oxycodone 5mg tablet postoperative pain control . Patients receive diary record pain level utilize visual analog score ( VAS ) first five postoperative day . The first pain level record post anesthesia care unit . Pain level record twice daily . Patients also ask log oxycodone use first five postoperative day . Patients educate preoperative postoperative diary . They also receive call OOOSC nurse postoperative day one address question concern . Patients evaluated office operate surgeon one week postoperative . At time , study diary collect .</detailed_description>
