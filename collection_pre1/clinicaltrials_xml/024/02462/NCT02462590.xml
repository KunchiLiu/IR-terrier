	<brief_summary>Probiotics commercially available live bacteria think health benefit ingest . A literature review probiotic study intensive care unit ( ICU ) find patient receive probiotic , 25 % reduction lung infection , know ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . There also 18 % reduction chance develop infection ICU . However , study review small well do . Therefore , whether probiotic really helpful unclear . Before large carefully perform study do evaluate effect probiotic critically ill patient , pilot trial need . The Investigators complete multicenter pilot RCT primary outcome relate feasibility . Feasibility goal meet . 1 ) Recruitment Pilot achieve 1 year ; 2 ) Adherence protocol 96 % ; 3 ) There case contamination ; 4 ) The VAP rate 15 % . This study important ongoing search effective strategy prevent serious infection critical illness . Probiotics may easy-to-use , readily available , inexpensive approach help future critically ill patient around world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotics Prevent Severe Pneumonia Endotracheal Colonization Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Probiotics live microorganism think health benefit ingest . Randomized controlled trial ( RCTs ) document favourable impact range clinical problem , include prevention upper respiratory tract infection , antibiotic-associated diarrhea , Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea , irritable bowel syndrome . Our recent meta-analysis probiotic RCTs intensive care unit ( ICU ) also suggest 25 % low rate ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) 18 % low infection rate overall administer critically ill mechanically ventilated patient . However , estimate arise small , modest quality single-center RCTs yield imprecise estimate effect uncertain generalizability , require confirmation large methodologically rigourous RCT . Before launch complex costly RCT test whether probiotic confer benefit , harm , impact infectious non-infectious outcome , pilot trial need . The investigator complete multicenter pilot RCT primary outcome relate feasibility : 1 ) recruitment success 1 year ; 2 ) &gt; 90 % adherence probiotic protocol ; 3 ) &lt; 5 % contamination ; 4 ) estimate VAP rate . Patients randomize 14 center Canada US , informed consent rate 84 % . Feasibility goal meet . 1 ) Recruitment Pilot achieve 1 year ; 2 ) Adherence protocol 96 % ; 3 ) There case contamination ; 4 ) The VAP rate 15 % . This internal Pilot incorporate main trial . Setting : 13 ICUs Canada , 2 ICUs United States Methods : Patients age 18 year old , admit ICU , anticipated duration ventilation ≥72 hour include . Patients exclude increase risk iatrogenic probiotic infection endovascular infection , primary diagnosis severe acute pancreatitis , percutaneous gastric jejunal feeding tube already situe , strict contraindication inability receive enteral medication , hopeless prognosis , withhold withdrawal advance life support plan , previous enrolment relate trial . Following informed consent , patient randomize variable unspecified block size fix allocation ratio 1:1 , stratify ICU medical/surgical/trauma status . Twice daily , patient receive either 1x1010 colony form unit ( CFU ) L. rhamnosus GG ( Culturelle , Locin Industries Ltd ) 1 capsule identical placebo capsule . Both suspended water administer via nasogastric tube capsule . Research Nurses notify local Study Pharmacists obtain informed consent . Study Pharmacists obtain allocation PROSPECT website . Only Database Manager Study Pharmacists access randomization schedule ; everyone else remain blinded . Patients receive intervention until:1 ) ICU discharge ; 2 ) death ; 3 ) isolation Lactobacillus spp . sterile site , culture sole predominant organism non-sterile site . RCT Trial Outcomes : The primary outcome VAP ; secondary outcome include ICU-acquired infection , diarrhea ( total , antibiotic-associated CDAD ) , antibiotic use , length stay mortality ICU hospital , acquire L. rhamnosus GG infection . Relevance : Despite clinical uptake exist VAP prevention strategy , morbidity , mortality cost VAP underscore need cost-effective intervention reduce impact . Whether probiotics impact VAP , infection CDAD , antibiotic-associated diarrhea antibiotic use unclear . When rigorously evaluate , probiotic may salutary effect decrease nosocomial infection prior RCTs suggest ; alternatively , probiotic may demonstrable effect , actually cause infection critically ill patient impaired immune function .</detailed_description>

Invasively mechanically ventilated &gt; 72 hour time screen ; 2 . Patients potential increase risk iatrogenic probiotic infection ( see Section 2.6 detailed explanation ) include specific immunocompromised population ( HIV &lt; 200 CD4 cells/μL , receive chronic immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , azathioprine , cyclosporine , cyclophosphamide , tacrolimus , methotrexate , mycofenolate , AntiIL2 ) , previous transplantation ( include stem cell ) time , malignancy require chemotherapy last 3 month , neutropenia [ absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 ] ) . However , patient receive corticosteroid previously presently project receive corticosteroid exclude ; 3 . Patients risk endovascular infection ( previously document rheumatic heart disease , congenital valve disease , surgically repair congenital heart disease , unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease , intracardiac repair prosthetic material [ mechanical bioprosthetic cardiac valve ] , previous current endocarditis , permanent endovascular device ( e.g. , endovascular graft [ e.g. , aortic aneurysm repair , stent involve large artery aorta , femorals carotids ] , inferior vena cava filter , dialysis vascular graft ) , tunnel ( shortterm ) hemodialysis catheter , pacemaker defibrillator . Patients temporary central venous catheter , central venous dialysis catheter peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICCs ) exclude patient coronary artery stent , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) neurovascular coil exclude ; patient mitral valve prolapse bicuspid aortic valve exclude provide exclusion criterion ; 4 . Patients primary diagnosis severe acute pancreatitis , without reference Ranson score [ Ranson 1974 ] ) . However , patient mild moderate pancreatitis exclude ; 5 . Patients percutaneous gastric jejunal feeding tube already situ per Health Canada guidance ; 6 . Strict contraindication inability receive enteral medication ; 7 . Intent withdraw advance life support per ICU physician ; 8 . Previous enrolment current enrolment potentially confound tria</criteria>
