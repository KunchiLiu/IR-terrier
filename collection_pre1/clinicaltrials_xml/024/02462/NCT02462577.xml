	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one common cancer diagnose woman significant cause mortality morbidity worldwide.Surgical treatment indicate patient . Persistent pain sensory disturbance follow surgery significant clinical problem average prevalence 20-23.9 % . Post-mastectomy chronic pain syndrome ( PMPS ) define pain neuropathic character locate area surgery and/or ipsilateral arm , present least 4 day per week , average intensity least 3 numeric rating scale 0 10 . The pathological mechanism may relate patient characteristic , surgical technique adjuvant therapy . Although genesis pain multi-factorial , section intercostobrachial nerve ( cutaneous branch T1-2 ) nerve lesion diagnose often . Uncontrolled acute postoperative pain define important risk factor development chronic pain . Local anesthetic investigate cancer breast patient many route ; paravertebral block , thoracic epidural , wound infiltration , topical lidocaine patch , topical application EMLA ( Eutectic Mixture Local Anesthetics ) cream operation site . Most study suggest well outcome term reduce postoperative pain improve patient satisfaction . Opioids exert local analgesic effect base several observation : • Nociceptive afferent nerve fiber contain peripheral opioid receptor silent except presence local inflammation . • Morphine metabolites largely undetectable systemically apply topically skin ulcer , suggest analgesic effect local • Peripheral opioid injection local analgesia , intra-articular morphine knee surgery , find effective several trial . An effective topical opioid analgesic could apply inflamed open skin lesion would useful option patient option pain relief exhaust .</detailed_description>
