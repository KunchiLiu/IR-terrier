Further , even though Brahmi study chemical composition therapeutic benefit whole , still severe gap respect complete composition Brahmi plant extract . No publish data exist Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) property Brahmi component . Hitherto , evidence mechanistic detail still speculative biological activity still phenomenological .
