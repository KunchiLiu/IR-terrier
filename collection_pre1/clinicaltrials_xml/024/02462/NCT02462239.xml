	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer fifth common cancer Canada relatively little progress alter clinical course last three decade . One major problem identify management disease , stag muscle invasive disease lead suboptimal treatment outcome . PET-CT potential accurately stage MIBC standard CT detect pelvic adenopathy and/or distant sit disease may find standard imaging . In former situation , aggressive therapy extend lymph node dissection and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior cystectomy offer . While latter situation patient spar morbidity cystectomy perform set metastatic disease . This study address whether PET-CT add clinically meaningful difference care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Imaging Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder Staging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter randomize control trial performed . Patients usually present symptom ( e.g. , painless hematuria ) . The urologist perform cystoscopy urothelial cancer bladder suspect , patient take operating room examination anesthesia ( EUA ) TURBT . If show muscle invasion conventional stag CT chest , abdomen , pelvis perform . The patient TNM Stage T2a-T4a N0-3 M0 eligible enrol trial . Eligible consent patient randomize 2:1 PET-CT none ( Control ) . The actual treatment receive patient document . The primary outcome measure treatment receive include : avoidance cystectomy , extensive lymph node surgery , neoadjuvant chemotherapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman newly diagnose muscleinvasive urothelial carcinoma bladder ( TNM stage T2aT4a , N03 , M0 ) , eligible radical cystectomy . Being consider treatment curative intent use radical cystectomy alone without neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy . Age &lt; 18 year . ECOG performance status &gt; 2 . Predominant histology ( &gt; 50 % specimen ) involve nonurothelial cell carcinoma . Prior partial cystectomy . Prior pelvis surgery obviate complete extended lymphadenectomy ( e.g. , aortofemoral/iliac bypass ) surgeon feel ability perform standard extend pelvic node dissection would compromise . Contraindications FDG PETCT . Inability lie supine imaging PETCT . Inadequate hepatic function : ( ) Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN ( ii ) SGOT Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 X ULN History another invasive malignancy within previous 5 year exception nonmelanoma skin cancer . Known pregnancy lactate female . Inability complete study require followup .</criteria>
