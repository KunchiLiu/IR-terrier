	<brief_summary>The study prospective open-label single-center study previously treat patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ( ALL ) . Treatment efficacy safety combination Oshadi D ( DNase Oshadi carrier ) Oshadi R ( RNase Oshadi carrier ) Salvage Chemotherapy evaluate . Oshadi D Oshadi R show anti-tumor activity good safety profile . Patients receive Oshadi D Oshadi R oral treatment combine salvage chemotherapy . Patient evaluate throughout study safety tolerance multiple dose regimen Oshadi D Oshadi R. Efficacy determine percentage bone marrow blast assessment day 28 post therapy initiation .</brief_summary>
