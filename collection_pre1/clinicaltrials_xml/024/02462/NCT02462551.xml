	<brief_title>Focal Electrically Administered Seizure Therapy Treatment Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) high morbidity escalate cost healthcare system society large . Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) remain effective acute antidepressant treatment TRD , significant risk cognitive impairment . The efficacy side effect conventional ECT contingent anatomic positioning electrode stimulus dosage . A technique could spatially target prefrontal cortex may preserve efficacy ECT simultaneously reduce cognitive side effect . The investigator recently demonstrate focal electrically-administered seizure therapy [ FEAST ] , markedly improve spatial target electrical current , feasible adult TRD individual . FEAST initiate seizure focally specifically prefrontal cortex prior secondary seizure generalization . Preliminary result depress human Columbia University later Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) generate PI ( Nahas ) show focal seizure produce clinically meaningful antidepressant response . Additional work need refine technique compare conventional approach . In study , investigator develop FEAST achieve clinically meaningful remission rate ( least 50 % subject ) . 30 TRD patient ( 20 complete record ) undergo open-label course FEAST adaptive number total session design maximize efficacy technique . The investigator use dose paradigm use current level 800 mA , finalize electrode size , test , one treatment session , effect reverse directionality current flow site seizure induction . Patients also undergo electroencephalography ( EEG ) assessment characterize induced seizure ' spatial temporal distribution . The investigator obtain time orientation recovery marker potential longer-term cognitive side effect . This technique could fundamentally change improve effective antidepressant treatment , simultaneously minimize eliminate major side-effects prohibit large adoption ECT .</detailed_description>
