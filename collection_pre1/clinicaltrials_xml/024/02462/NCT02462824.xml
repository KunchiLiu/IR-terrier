	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect home-based exercise intervention walk ability people peripheral artery disease . In 200 patient peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) , investigator conduct randomize control trial determine whether patient-centered home-based exercise program improve walk ability , physical activity , mobility , pain , social functioning , compare usual care group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Centered Home Exercise Program Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) common chronic condition affect 8 million people United States . PAD patient difficulty walk cholesterol blockage leg artery prevent adequate oxygen supply leg muscle activity . PAD patient reduce physical activity level slow walk speed avoid leg pain . Few therapy available help PAD patient improve walk limitation . Treadmill exercise program require three supervised exercise session per week exercise facility help PAD patient walk less pain . However , people PAD participate supervise exercise program pay medical insurance requirement burdensome patient . The investigator engage PAD patient relevant stakeholder develop home-based exercise intervention tailor needs patient . Our home-based exercise intervention include Fitbit activity monitor coach telephone PAD participant regularly schedule interval . PAD patient use Fitbit help monitor exercise behavior . The coach use well-established behavioral method schedule telephone call help PAD patient adhere regular walking exercise . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial 200 patient PAD determine whether home-based walking exercise program significantly improve walk performance patient-centered outcome nine-month follow-up , compare usual care . PAD patient select trial 's outcome measure best represent PAD patient ' physical limitation . All outcomes well-validated accepted outcome measure . The primary outcome measure six-minute walk test , objective measure walk endurance . Secondary outcome consist Walking Impairment Questionnaire PROMIS questionnaires assess patient-perceived walking ability , mobility , pain , social functioning . If home-based exercise intervention successful , intervention substantial impact large grow number people disabled PAD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Participants ankle brachial index ( ABI ) ≤ 0.90 eligible participation . 2 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 ≤ 1.00 experience 20 % drop ankle pressure heelrise exercise eligible . 3 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 medical record evidence prior low extremity revascularization PAD eligible 4 . Participants ABI &gt; 0.90 medical record evidence PAD base noninvasive vascular laboratory test base angiographic finding eligible . Noninvasive vascular laboratory evidence PAD must obtain vascular laboratory . 1 . Above knee amputation , critical limb ischemia , wheelchair confinement , foot ulcer , nonEnglish speaking , significant visual impairment interferes walk activity , hear impairment interferes full study participation , unable return medical center fitness center expect visit frequency , unwilling use technology require intervention . 2 . Individuals whose walk limited condition PAD . 3 . Greater class II NYHA heart failure angina . Increase angina , angina rest , abnormal baseline stress test . 4 . Major surgery include low extremity revascularization orthopedic surgery prior three month anticipate next nine month . 5 . Major medical illness include lung disease require oxygen , Parkinson 's disease impair walk ability , cancer require treatment prior two year ( potential participant may still qualify diagnosed nonmelanoma skin cancer past two year treatment early stage cancer past two year prognosis excellent ) . 6 . Heart attack , stroke , coronary artery bypass surgery last 3 month . 7 . Minimental status examination score &lt; 23 , dementia , psychiatric illness . 8 . Currently walk regularly exercise level comparable amount exercise prescribe intervention 9 . Currently enrol another clinical trial , exercise trial , cardiac rehabilitation . Currently enrol clinical trial current participation cardiac rehabilitation trial therapeutic intervention within past three month . For clinical trial stem cell gene therapy intervention , potential participant potentially eligible immediately final study visit clinical trial , long least six month pass since participant receive final treatment stem cell gene therapy study . 10 . Deemed poor candidate study poorly suit intervention ( PI discretion ) .</criteria>
