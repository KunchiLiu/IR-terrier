	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROTOCOL Hypothesis : The presence amyloid protein myocardium change function tissue characteristic . These change responsible poor prognosis patient cardiac amyloidosis . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) offer novel , non-invasive approach identify cardiac involvement may impact patient management . This study include prospective validation CMR parameter qualify abnormal retrospective study ( study ID 2012-3315 ) current literature . The myocardium/blood pool inversion time null point ratio ( Myo/BlP TI0 ratio ) , qualify significantly different compare control retrospective study . Specific Aims : 1 . Validate diagnostic accuracy CMR parameter prospective manner cardiac amyloidosis patient . 2 . CMR parameter , include Myo/BlP TI0 ratio , compare serum biomarkers ( TroponinT , NT-proBNP , serum lambda/kappa free light chain concentration ) , establish prognostic value cardiac amyloidosis . Subjects followed via death registry and/or medical record compare prognostic value CMR parameter biomarkers . 3 . CMR parameter use assess presence early cardiac involvement amyloidosis patient without clinically apparent cardiac involvement ( determine symptom , biomarkers and/or cardiac imaging ) . 4 . CMR use follow patient undergo treatment , available , determine whether CMR parameter consistent presence cardiac amyloidosis , change treatment . Background Significance : Matthias Schleiden , German botanist co-creator cell theory , used term amyloid 1834 characterize waxy starch plant . Today , amyloid use describe number small protein aggregate lead insoluble fibrillar deposit . Many mechanism protein dysfunction contribute amyloidogenesis , include `` non-physiologic proteolysis , defective physiologic proteolysis , mutation involve change thermodynamic kinetic property , pathway yet define '' . Amyloid deposit identify basis apple-green birefringence polarize light microscope stain Congo red . They also identify base presence rigid , non-branching fibril use electron microscopy . Amyloidosis describes infiltration organ insoluble deposit . In human , 27 different unrelated protein know form amyloid fibril vivo . The organ involve clinical presentation dependent precursor protein . A small number amyloidoses cardiac involvement significant impact mortality . The clinically significant cardiac amyloidoses include immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis ( AL ) transthyretin amyloidoses ( ATTR ) ; ATTR either hereditary secondary mutation transthyretin gene acquire secondary wild type transthyretin protein . AL amyloidosis , common type systemic amyloidosis , associate plasma cell dyscrasia . In AL amyloidosis , fifty percent affect patient cardiac involvement . Despite potential amyloid deposition multiple organ , cardiac involvement continue dictate poor prognosis . Once congestive heart failure develop patient AL amyloidosis , survival le 6 month untreated . Therefore , patient AL amyloidosis screen , assess serum troponins brain natriuretic peptide , determine whether cardiac involvement present . Patients ATTR amyloidosis typically insidious onset comparison . ATTR amyloidosis also respond well traditional congestive heart failure management . However , neither AL ATTR amyloidoses manage like traditional heart failure make appropriate diagnosis critical best care . Furthermore , early diagnosis cardiac involvement may improve outcome require heighten suspicion systematic clinical approach evaluation [ 3 ] . In cardiac amyloidosis , evidence disease routine testing . Restrictive physiology echocardiography , low EKG voltage well additional EKG abnormality often identify advanced cardiac amyloidosis . Routine nuclear cardiac image proven helpful diagnosis , although 123I-MIBG appear demonstrate co-localization denervation amyloid deposition . Unfortunately , routine cardiac test specific cardiac amyloidosis . Therefore , absence high clinical suspicion cardiac amyloidosis , appropriate diagnosis often miss . Endomyocardial biopsy remain gold standard make diagnosis cardiac involvement . However , give invasive nature endomyocardial biopsy associate risk ( include death ) , diagnosis cardiac amyloidosis usually make non-invasive mean ; diagnosis support non-cardiac biopsy demonstrate amyloid deposit . The frequently biopsied site abdominal fat pad , usually positive patient AL amyloidosis . However , ATTR amyloidosis reliably identify fat pad biopsy . Therefore , negative fat pad biopsy require work include endomyocardial biopsy associate immunostaining genetic test transthyretin mutation . Supporting diagnosis cardiac amyloidosis noninvasive technique EKG , echocardiography serum amyloid component scintigraphy show significant limitation . A novel non-invasive approach require ensure accurate diagnosis . Given limitation previously use non-invasive technique , interest last decade use cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image diagnosis cardiac amyloidosis . The utility CMR evaluate patient cardiac amyloidosis first propose 1990s . However , evaluation limit assessment myocardial morphology function . It turn century powerful diagnostic potential delay gadolinium enhancement ( DGE ) realize . The first utility DGE evaluation myocardial viability patient coronary artery disease . It quickly become apparent DGE could also use evaluate patient non-ischemic cardiomyopathy . The characterization cardiac amyloidosis DGE first describe global sub-endocardial enhancement . Abnormal T1 transmyocardial map use describe abnormality assist determination prognosis . However , study limit inclusion patient biopsy-proven amyloidosis also meet echocardiographic criterion restrictive physiology , common advance cardiac amyloidosis . More recent work precluding use echocardiographic diagnosis support concept inability null myocardium relative blood pool may early sign cardiac amyloidosis . In addition , DGE data , study utilize T1 T2 weight image identify abnormal extracellular volume ( ECV ) myocardial edema cardiac amyloidosis population . It culmination finding , addition experience study cardiac amyloidosis lead hypothesis presence amyloid protein , know increase ECV , may also change inversion time curve blood pool myocardium . These feature , well abnormal functional parameter , help detect cardiac amyloidosis earlier would otherwise possible morphologic assessment . The possibility diagnose sub-clinical disease implication screen patient know amyloidosis early cardiac involvement . Also , CMR parameter may useful assess response treatment plasma cell dyscrasia , cardiac amyloidosis , may complicate heart failure ventricular tachycardia . Lastly , relationship MRI finding cardiac biomarkers yet describe assess study . Preliminary Data : The investigator observe significant difference Myo/BlP TI0 ratio patient cardiac amyloidosis compare control preserve LV function ( CTL ) non-amyloid cardiomyopathy ( CTL-CMP ) . The Myo/BlP TI0 ratio CA group close 1 1 ( 0.95 +/- 0.16 ) lead poor myocardium blood pool contrast correspond delay enhancement image acquire follow TI scout ( Figure 7 ) . The Myo/BlP TI0 ratio provide quantitative method support diagnosis cardiac amyloidosis patient present cardiac symptom . Estimated Period Time Completion : Estimated time completion aim 1 , 2 4 depend power calculation follow acquisition pilot prospective data . The estimated timing completion aim 3 12-18 month start data acquisition .</detailed_description>
