	<brief_summary>Self-control become strong predictor academic success life outcome . Early childhood development research indicate great self-control lead well health , great wealth , less propensity engage criminal activity . This study seek assess strength play-based `` Tools Mind '' ( TOM ) program improve preschooler self-control . It compare TOM alternative play-based program , call `` Playing Learn '' ( PTL ) , implement YMCA Canada childcare setting across country . This study hypothesize measure self-control measure social behavior academic success preschooler two year TOM program great measure self-control measure social behavior academic success preschooler PTL program two-years .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Tools Mind Enhancing Self-Control Preschoolers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We compare growth self-control relate area development ( mathematics , reading , language , social reasoning ) child teach TOM child instruct Playing Learn ( PTL ; Eden &amp; Huggins , 2001 ) - play base preschool program wide use YMCA childcare setting across Canada ( United States ) . PTL develop educator/author General Manager Education , Development , Research YMCA Canada . It select comparison program also coherent play-based program . In previous study involve TOM , comparison program differ TOM number dimension often play-based ( e.g . Diamond et al. , 2007 ) , pose challenge interpretation result . In contrast TOM , activity PTL child initiate prescribed . Teachers train observe child play capitalize learn opportunity arise . For example , child use block build fort , may encourage think size arrangement block influence final structure , count number block involve , number child structure accommodate well structure 's affordances . Instruction self-control emergent property child-initiated activity . For example , teacher may help child solve problem block child interested block building activity , organize team take turn . They may assist conflict resolution help child generate alternative solution stop think conflict use word instead impulsive action express dissatisfaction . Comparison development self-control child teach TOM PTL program thus provide sense benefit ( ) child focus , teacher-directed approach teach self-control . The primary research question : Do preschool child teach TOM program show great growth self-control peer teach PTL program two year period ? The secondary research question : If significant difference TOM PTL child growth self-control , enhance growth confer benefit development generally ( child 's cognitive , social , linguistic academic development ) ? The propose efficacy study conduct partnership YMCA organization great Toronto area . The study duration two year TOM program follow 2-year in-service training plan child expect reach maximal benefit exposure program second year . Twenty YMCA sit participate , one participate preschool class ( 2 teacher ) site . The criterion inclusion list site must least one preschool class , instruction must take place English , preschooler currently attendance must slat attend full-day Kindergarten ( per province 's roll plan ) within study period . Ten site ( class ) randomly assign either TOM PTL condition . The YMCA agree provide data proportion family serve site pay full fee whose fee subsidize . These data serve proxy socioeconomic status two group . Random assignment result difference two group mean proportion family pay full fee . Both group teacher receive training ( TOM ) in-service workshop ( PTL ) respective program , two year study . Training TOM conduct require program developer ; two day train fall three full day follow train - one late fall , winter spring - two year study . Professionals TOM organization conduct TOM training well follow-up coach assistance TOM teacher need . Teachers new YMCA receive two full day PTL training . All receive service workshop every year well ongoing in- class teacher training coaching . The workshops ongoing assistance administer senior YMCA training staff , wealth experience PTL program . Every effort make align amount time training/workshops two group . The teacher group instruct student accord assigned program entire study period ( 2 year ) , include summertime . Program fidelity assess two way : 1 ) . use teacher assessment data generate experienced evaluator program , per standard practice TOM PTL program 2 ) . classroom observation . Both program establish method assess teacher fidelity ( Bodrova &amp; Leong , 2007 ; Eden &amp; Huggins , 2001 ) . Successful implementation TOM program take several month achieve say reach acceptable fidelity level around March first year . Fidelity assess periodically , first two year implementation . The YMCA conduct teacher assessment include PTL fidelity measure annually , around April . We use result early spring ( April ) assessments two year study , program , determine teacher ' implementation fidelity respective program . Although organization report reach acceptable level fidelity typically problematic , PTL TOM assessment conduct use different method , criterion instrument documentation . These capture fidelity respective program - judge trained observer program - however , address either difference possible similarity program . This information could provide critical insight mechanism might sub-serve different success rate ( effect development self-regulation ) two program , difference arise . Hence , also conduct observation . A member research team visit site full day document observation use Preschool Observation Measure ( POM ) , currently develop research team . The POM contains list observable activity practice one would expect see typical TOM classroom , typical PTL classroom general practice one would expect see quality child care set . The observer rate classroom respect well teacher administer activity . The idea TOM teacher rate highly TOM practice PTL teacher highly PTL activity , two group may overlap substantially general teaching practice . The observation rating do spring ( April - May ) two year study . Participants . Preschool class teacher randomly select preschool classroom target site ( n = 10 TOM 10 PTL class , 20 TOM 20 PTL teacher , N= 20 class 40 teacher ) . The criterion participation study teacher : valid Ontario Early Childhood Education certification ; permanent , full-time status ; plan take leave absence study period ; proficiency speak English ; know uncorrected hearing vision impairment ; previous experience TOM program ; sign teacher consent form . As teacher already provide instruction English , English proficiency uncorrected impairment requirement expect rule teacher currently work YMCA . Twelve fourteen child , per participate preschool class , randomly select track course study ( n 's = 120-140 child condition , N = 240-280 ) . Boys girl equally represent . The criteria student participation : bear July 2007 December 2008 , inclusive ( 3 4 year age 2011 ) , sufficient command English understand teacher 's instruction ( judge teacher , English Second Language - ELL - student include provided meet criterion ) ; know uncorrected sensory , neurological , physical impairment might prevent full participation activity outline either program ( , judge teacher ) sign parental consent form . We obtain information regard teacher student criterion YMCA . As primary research question concern relative efficacy TOM improve self-regulation skill , primary outcome measure two task tap inhibitory control ( see ) . Our secondary research question concern implication enhance self-control child 's development generally include cognitive , social/emotional , language , academic development well attention skill overall adjustment . Accordingly , measure change study period development child 's classroom home behaviour , attention skill , theory mind , receptive expressive vocabulary , mathematics , well draw , write pre/early literacy skill , link executive function ( see e.g . McInnes , Humphries , Hogg-Johnson &amp; Tannock , 2003 Martinussen , Hayden , Hogg-Johnson &amp; Tannock , 2005 , poor attention skill Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) ; Kyte , Goodyer &amp; Sahakian , 2005 inhibitory control depression ; Carlson &amp; Moses , 2001 theory mind executive function ; Carlson &amp; Moses , 2001 Hughes , 1998 inhibitory control language , Blair &amp; Razza , 2007 Bull &amp; Scerif , 2001 inhibitory control read mathematics skill ) . All measure administer fall spring two year study ( 2011-2012 2012-2013 ) . Children test individually , quiet location preschool , regular preschool hour . We coordinate teacher ensure minimal disruption classroom four data collection time point . The total test time child 35-45 minute time point ( spring fall two study year ) , divide two test session 25 minute ( exclude time drawings/play plan administer part PTL TOM curriculum ) . To help maintain motivation , task present form game , break give task need child praise effort . Previous experience show child age group find `` game '' highly enjoyable 30 minute focus attention variety task well within attention range preschooler , work experienced experimenter .</detailed_description>
