The main criterion study time course Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ( FMA ) . Spastic patient single stroke , since less two month , include try . They receive time oral tablet five month intramuscular injection . Patients randomize three arm plan distribution balance group 5 patient 2 -2- 1 model : botulinum toxin placebo baclofen ( 120 patient ) , oral baclofen placebo botulinum toxin ( 120 patient ) , placebo baclofen placebo botulinum toxin ( 60 patient ) . The FMA score assess treatment start , one month three month later . Spasticity , functional ability , capacity activity daily life , pain quality life also assess study Tardieu score , Rivermead Motor Assessment scale , Barthel index , Rankin score , Visual Analogic Scale Reintegration Normal Life Index respectively . A positive difference 12 point time course FMA botulinum toxin group comparison baclofen group consider minimum relevant effect . 300 patient plan include 20 center 2 year trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke first cause motor impairment disability adult . 80 % post-stroke survivor motor weakness result hemiplegia . Post-stroke patient partially recover motor impairment . These patient reach maximum motor score round first 20 week . In case , motor recovery period consider complete beyond sixth month . There consensus epidemiological study fundamental work brain plasticity , positive effect rehabilitation post stroke motor recovery . Then main objective rehabilitation first six month follow stroke facilitate motor recovery . There many argument animal human pharmacological modulation post-stroke motor recovery . In animal , experimental data suggest efficacy amphetamine motor recovery brain injury , numerous . The administration amphetamine rat dramatically improve motor recovery brain injury . This action appear related α noradrenergic activity amphetamine property norepinephrine precursor . In contrast molecule reduce release norepinephrine , increase metabolism , block post-synaptic effect gabaergic drug clonidine deleterious effect motor recovery brain injury . In human , result study concern action amphetamine much contrast . A study functional image show single dose methylphenidate able modulate brain plasticity post-stroke patient increase activity substitute neural network lesioned hemisphere . However , clinical study confirm positive result , others opposite show behavioral effect recovery compare placebo group . In human , also arguments positive effect serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) drug . Functional neuroimaging study show SRI modulate action brain plasticity sensorimotor cortex . Single dose SRI responsible increase neuronal activity sensorimotor cortex correlate improvement behavioral test healthy subject post-stroke patient . In small clinical trial , Dam et al show positive effect motor recovery prescription fluoxetine associate rehabilitation , irrespective antidepressant activity molecule . A randomized control multicentre trial ( FLAME ) , compare effect post-stroke motor recovery assess Fugl-Meyer score , treatment fluoxetine placebo publish . This trial confirm positive effect fluoxetine recovery motor function post stroke hemiplegic . Regarding deleterious drug GABAergic especially diazepam test animal model recovery brain injury . The administration molecules negative impact functional recovery . Golsdtein study impact motor recovery prescription GABAergic drug benzodiazepine neuroleptic recovery phase brain injured patient . It show regardless indication drug negative effect recovery patient . Conjointly 15 % 40 % post-stroke hemiplegic develop spasticity responsible increase disability . Spasticity symptom characterized increase resistance passive mobilization relation post-stroke exaggeration spinal reflex later muscular component . Usual antispastic drug action reflex component muscular one . Then many physician want treat spasticity early stroke even recovery phase , development muscular change . Until recently France , patient treat oral tablet baclofen . Now number patient receive intramuscular injection botulinum A toxin increase . However literature , drug test post-stroke spasticity chronicle phase , sixth month action motor recovery remain largely unknown . Botulinum toxin increase weakness inject muscle baclofen belongs family gabaergic drug demonstrate deleterious effect animal model recovery . • Purpose : In specific population post-stroke hemiplegic , antispastic drug reduce spasticity least respect functional recovery . Then study want compare effect motor recovery two usual antispastic treatment administrated end second month stroke : botulinum toxin versus oral baclofen . Our hypothesis botulinum toxin respectful motor recovery Baclofen may promote functional recovery .</detailed_description>
