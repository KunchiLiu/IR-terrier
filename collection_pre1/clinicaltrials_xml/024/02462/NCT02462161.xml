	<brief_title>Study Nasal Insulin Fight Forgetfulness - Short-Acting Insulin Aspart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest insulin play role normal memory process insulin abnormality may contribute cognitive brain change associate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Interestingly , insulin administer nasal cavity transport within minute brain , affect blood sugar insulin level . This trial consist randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group trial 30 participant AD MCI receive twice daily intranasal administration insulin aspart ( 20 IU bid ) placebo ( saline bid ) 12 week . All participant appoint `` support person '' answer collateral questionnaire supervise administration study drug . All participant study partner undergo intensive , structured training program self-management intranasal insulin administration . Cognitive test blood collection occur baseline , 6 week treatment , end 12 week treatment period . Participants also receive lumbar puncture measure AD biomarkers subject 's cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) .</detailed_description>
