	<brief_summary>Study GT 026 Phase 2 , multicenter , parallel group , North American , randomize , placebo control , double blind study . This study enroll subject portal hypertension ( HVPG great equal 6 mm Hg ) also liver biopsy cirrhosis ( Ishak stage 5 6 ) , presumably due NASH , exclude subject medium large varix decompensated cirrhosis . Subjects portal hypertension cirrhosis randomly assign ( 1:1:1 ratio ) receive 1 3 treatment assignment include placebo , GR MD 02 dose 2 mg/kg lean body mass , GR MD 02 dose 8 mg/kg lean body mass administer every week 52 week period total 26 intravenous infusion . The primary endpoint analysis baseline adjust change HVPG 1 year ( 53 55 week ) subject treat placebo compare subject treat GR MD 02 ( 2 mg/kg/week 8 mg/kg/week ) . An esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) evaluation varix , HVPG , liver biopsy perform first infusion final 26th dose IMP . Additionally , subject undergo FibroScan ( available ) prior first infusion , Infusion Visit 13 , 14 28 day follow final 26th infusion , MBT ( available ) perform screening , Infusion Visit 13 , 14 28 day final infusion , blood collect assessment biomarkers . All subject attend 2 postdose visit : first occur 14 28 day final dose administration second occur 14 day follow first postdose visit . Subjects offer enrollment subsequent separate study , open label extension study , adequate tolerability safety issue sign clinical progression would recommend discontinuation . Subjects enroll open label extension study contact via telephone every 6 month 2 year annually thereafter total 4 year .</brief_summary>
