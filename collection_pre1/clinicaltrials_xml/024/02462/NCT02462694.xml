	<brief_summary>Suicide press problem US military , evidence increase risk suicide particularly among soldier serve Iraq Afghanistan . To date , study empirically evaluate treatment efficacy prevent suicide . One treatment show empirically decrease suicidal behavior Dialectical Behavioral Therapy ( DBT ) , although study limit patient borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) . The current proposal aim examine efficacy DBT reduce suicidal behavior broadly diagnostically heterogeneous group veteran high risk suicidal behavior . One difficulty research suicide prevention serious suicidal behavior relatively rare event , alone satisfactory target treatment study . It extremely important , therefore , identify intermediate symptom closely associate high risk suicidal behavior , target treatment . One critical area proposal address validate new treatment model suicide veteran ; DBT empirically validate reduce suicidal behavior individual BPD , test broadly target suicidal behavior . The second critical area proposal address explore new suicide risk assessment measure . While investigator specifically propose develop new screening tool , investigator propose identify potentially important domain specifically differentiate ill high risk suicide veteran low risk . This information useful future effort modify DBT approach effective broad diagnostic group high risk suicidal veteran .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Risk Suicidal Behavior Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project propose two related study . The first project randomize clinical trial 120 veteran identify high-risk suicidal behavior compare efficacy DBT vs. treatment usual ( TAU ) suicidal behavior primary outcome measure . A second aim present project examine group differences 200 300 veteran high risk suicide 200 veteran low risk variety symptom domain . The goal identify symptom associate suicidal behavior use secondary exploratory outcome measure DBT . The investigator assess symptom domain include mood substance use associate suicidal behavior previous research validate veteran population compare symptom low vs. high risk veteran recently discharge James J Peters VAMC ( JJPVA ) psychiatric inpatient unit . In addition , investigator explore index interpersonal function measure feature evidence offering protection suicide , could view resilience factor . A particular emphasis present project characterize nature interpersonal dysfunction high risk individual , exists good evidence social isolation , lack sense `` belonging '' put people particularly high risk suicide , particular military sample . The investigator intend assess impact DBT vs. TAU symptom domains addition impact suicidal behavior . The subject population project veterans identify `` high risk '' suicide list James J. Peters VAMC ; veteran identify suicide coordinator recent inpatient hospitalization involve high-risk suicidal behavior . Priority give OEF/OIF veteran . In order identify symptom associate high risk suicidal behavior , investigator examine symptom domain high risk subject contrast comparison group veterans recently discharge psychiatric inpatient service treat outpatient mental health department James J Peters VA Medical Center history high-risk suicidal behavior ( low risk veteran ) . Groups match respect age gender . For project , investigator include veteran variety diagnosis , include post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , substance abuse , affective disorder , personality disorder , anxiety disorder . The investigator exclude subject current psychosis cognitive impairment symptom would prevent appropriate engagement DBT . Patients high-risk suicide list eligible participate six month DBT treatment study randomize full DBT vs. TAU . Both group psychopharmacological management outpatient psychiatrist able participate standard ancillary outpatient clinical offering ( e.g . AA , sleep group ) . Both treatment group assess baseline , 6 month treatment completion mark , well follow-up time point include one year eighteen month enrollment .</detailed_description>
