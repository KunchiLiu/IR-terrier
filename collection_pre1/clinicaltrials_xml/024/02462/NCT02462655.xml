	<brief_summary>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) autosomal codominant single-gene disorder cause mutation LDL receptor gene disrupt normal clearance LDL particles plasma compartment . Heterozygous patient present 2- 3-fold raise plasma LDL-cholesterol ( C ) concentration , tendinous xanthomatosis premature atherosclerotic coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , usually occur age 35 55 year . Since mid-1970s , LDL-C remove blood patient use plasmapheresis , technique show improve life expectancy FH homozygotes . LDL apheresis selectively remove LDL particle immunoglobulins beneficial protein , thereby overcome potential drawback traditional plasmapheresis method . LDL-C effectively reduce 60 % immediately LDL apheresis , although LDL level rebound rapidly . Dextran sulfate adsorption commonly apheresis technique use familial hypercholesterolemia patient . In apheresis plasma separate red blood cell pass column cellulose bead contain dextran sulfate bind apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) highly selective electrostatic binding mechanism . Since LDL , very-low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) , Lipoprotein ( ) contain apoB , dextran sulfate adsorption apheresis selectively reduce lipoproteins little effect non-apoB containing HDL particle . In clinical practice , LDL apheresis reduces rate future cardiovascular event postulate additional effect potentially pro-atherogenic factor . Some protein identify adhesive characteristic lipoprotein , rheological , immunological inflammation relevant proteins16-19 influence microcirculation well inflammatory response . However , study yet investigate impact LDL apheresis expression different gene involve cardiovascular disease . The main objective present research project investigate impact LDL apheresis dextran sulfate adsorption system messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression gene involve cardiovascular disease use microarrays analysis 9 FH homozygote .</brief_summary>
