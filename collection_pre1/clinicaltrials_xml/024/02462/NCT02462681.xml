	<brief_title>Ketamine Adjunctive Analgesic With Bupivacaine Paravertebral Analgesia Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer perhaps common cancer woman require frequent surgical intervention . Nearly 40 % post-operative breast surgery patient experience significant acute post-operative pain , pain score five reflect inadequacy conventional pain management . Most response human body post-surgical pain proven detrimental patient 's homeostasis recovery . Moreover , incidence chronic postoperative pain breast surgery patient high 50 % inadequate analgesia consider independent risk factor . Hence , number therapeutic measure accept part `` multi-modal '' approach post-operative pain control . Thoracic Paravertebral Block ( PVB ) use pain relief thoracotomy , mastectomy . PVB provide profound , long last sensory differentiation . The result great attenuation surgical stress response may translate reduce inotropic stimulation heart . Additionally , unlike general anesthesia , PVB provide superior postoperative analgesia , less nausea vomiting , short recovery time ; require few analgesic , early mobilization , early home readiness discharge . The use PVB patient undergo ambulatory breast surgery cost-saving potential . There little systematic research efficacy tolerability addition adjunctive analgesic agent paravertebral analgesia . The addition adjunctive analgesic , fentanyl clonidine local anesthetic show enhance quality duration sensory neural blockade , decrease dose local anesthetic supplemental analgesia . Ketamine anaesthetic agent potent analgesic property . Its mode action include noncompetitive antagonism N-methyl d-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor local anaesthetic effect . ketamine extensively used epidural caudal route variable results.It posse definite advantage conventional local anaesthetic agent stimulate cardiovascular system respiratory system.The advantage ketamine include good analgesic effect , cardio vascular stability hypotensive state , bronchodilatation asthmatic , absence awareness . Disadvantages include increased heart rate blood pressure , emergence phenomenon , laryngospasm apnea , increase intracranial intraocular pressure , lack visceral anesthesia .</detailed_description>
