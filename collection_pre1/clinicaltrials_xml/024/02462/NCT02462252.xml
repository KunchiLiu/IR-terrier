	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , phase IIa study subject AA Hypoplastic MDS . Eligible subject receive subcutaneous ( SC ) injection BL-8040 monotherapy 10 day . From Day 11 Day 14 , subject receive hATG , Methylprednisolone Cyclosporine . From Day 15 Day 30 ( first month ) , subject continue treatment Methylprednisolone Cyclosporine . Cyclosporine continue daily Month 6/Day 30 ( M6/D30 ) ( end study treatment ) . Beginning M2/D1 , BL-8040 administer daily part maintenance period first 5 day month M6 . All BL-8040 injection course give site , either inpatient outpatient per treat physician 's decision . The primary objective study determine efficacy treatment BL-8040 top standard immunotherapy regimen : hATG , cyclosporine , steroids patient Hypoplastic MDS AA . Safety efficacy assess define time-points throughout study . Duration response overall survival assess part long term FU . A maximum 25 patient enrol study .
