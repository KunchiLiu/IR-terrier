	<brief_title>Apneic Oxygenation During Airway Management Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study aim investigate effect plan practice change ; institute oxygenation via nasal cannula induction anesthesia . The use nasal cannula peri-intubation period minimal risk consider standard care pediatric anesthesia . Some provider use certain clinical situation , broadly use virtually pediatric literature support refute use . At institution , intubation pediatric patient inexperienced ( learner ) provider expert supervision routine . The attend physician intervenes necessary patient experience excessive loss oxygenation . Participants enrol study enter pre-operative area determine attend anesthesiologist eligible study participant . Participants enrol first three month study ( N=200 ) assign baseline condition describe . Participants enrol second phase study ( N=300 ) assign with-cannula condition describe . Apneic oxygenation base physiology lung : absorb great volume oxygen , 250 ml/min adult , volume carbon dioxide , 8-20 mL/min , release lung , majority carbon dioxide buffer blood stream apnea . With imbalanced volume absorption release gas lung low atmospheric pressure lung , create passive movement gas pharynx alveoli . If gas pharynx significantly high percentage oxygen instead room air 21 % oxygen , high amount oxygen passively deliver lung absorption prolong time hemoglobin desaturation . For Baseline Group observational study , intubation procedure perform per usual practice . Patients receive premedication determine anesthesiologist/resident/midlevel . Once patient bring operate room vital sign monitor , patient preoxygenated via mask per standard care , expire oxygenation concentration minimum 0.75 . Vitals record moment prior removal face mask end preoxygenation period . Anesthetic induction perform agent dosage per provider 's clinical judgment . Airway management consist oral endotracheal intubation laryngeal mask airway insertion take place . As per standard care , attend physician expert pediatric airway management supervise procedure intervene patient experience excessive oxygen desaturation . For With-Cannula Group , step maintain . The sole difference nasal cannula placement induction . It set deliver oxygen 5 liter per minute . Airway management consist oral endotracheal intubation laryngeal mask airway insertion take place . As per standard care , attend physician expert pediatric airway management supervise procedure intervene patient experience excessive oxygen desaturation . Apneic oxygenation use long-term oxygenation strategy . No patient allow become hypoxic research reason . All intubation procedure study group proceed per usual practice . The goal intubation procedure always remain maintenance adequate oxygen saturation .</detailed_description>
