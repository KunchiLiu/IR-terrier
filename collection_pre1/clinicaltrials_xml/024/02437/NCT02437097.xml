	<brief_summary>Many study examine effect aerobic exercise play video game effect cognitive performance , result show increase cognitive performance . Presently , limit research regard effect combination game exercise cognitive performance . The purpose study investigate effect play video game , aerobic exercise , combination game aerobic exercise cognitive performance . Forty healthy subject , male female ( 18-30 year old ) perform moderate exercise least two time week comprise sample . The study randomize clinical trial four independent variable : play video game , aerobic exercise , combination simultaneous game aerobic exercise control condition . Aerobic exercise perform intensity 60 70 % maximum heart rate Monarch Lower Body Ergometer . Brain Age Game : Train Your Brain Minutes Day ! play Nintendo 3DS . Executive function measure use Stroop test Trails B pre posttest . Analysis variance Stroop test Trails B use . In event significant F statistic , post hoc test analysis use . The investigator hypothesize combination aerobic exercise simultaneous game produce great increase cognitive performance . Furthermore , beneficial change utilize rehabilitation protocol design improve cognitive functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include 40 subject , male female , age 18-30 year old . Subjects consist trained individual log least two days/week moderate exercise . The source participant come New York Institute Technology community . Participants select accord inclusion/exclusion criteria.Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age range : 18-30 year 2 . Good overall health 3 . Exercise least two days/week Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Any cardiopulmonary condition include asthma within last 6 month . 2 . Any major musculoskeletal injury ( i.e . torn ligament , bone fracture , etc . ) last 6 month . 3 . Any health issue would interfere subject 's safety exercise . 4 . Any auditory/vestibular impairment . 5 . Uncorrected visual problem . Dr. Douris take medical history prospective subject order evaluate presence exclusion criterion . We use Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) medical questionnaire . All volunteer sign inform consent participation study . Each subject require one hour test undertake specific condition randomly assign . Upon consent form completion subject instruct Stroop Trails B test administer . The Stroop test : subject ask read word color , state color various letter test process speed , state color font word actual word describe conflict color test response inhibition ( executive functioning ) . The Trails B test : subject instruct connect set 25 dot fast possible maintain accuracy . This test provide information visual search speed , scanning , speed processing , mental flexibility , executive functioning . Both test take approximately 5 minute administer . They utilize extensively literature measure change executive function result exercise . The subject also familiarize Brain Age game time consent . Detailed instruction test day follow : Pre Post test Stroop Trails B test occur four conditions:1 ) Aerobic exercise 2 ) Aerobic exercise Gaming simultaneously 3 ) Gaming 4 ) Control condition sit quietly 30 minute . All test take place School Health Professions Research Room , Room 507 500 Building . Acute Bouts Aerobic Exercise : Participants perform 30 minute cycle intensity 60 70 % maximum heart rate base 220 - age . The aerobic exercise utilize Monarch 818E Monarch Lower Body Ergometer ( Monark Exercise , Stockholm , Sweden ) . Participant 's heart rate monitor use Polar heart rate monitor . Acute Bouts Video Game : Participants play Brain Age : Train Your Brain Minutes Day ! Nintendo 3DS 30 minute seat rest position . Acute Bouts Aerobic Exercise Video Games : Participants perform 30 minute cycle intensity 60 70 % maximum heart rate base 220 minus age Monarch ergometer play Brain Age : Train Your Brain Minutes Day ! Nintendo 3DS . Participant 's heart rate monitor use Polar heart rate .</detailed_description>
