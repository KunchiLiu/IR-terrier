	<brief_title>Ph1b/2 Dose-Escalation Study Entinostat With Pembrolizumab NSCLC With Expansion Cohorts NSCLC Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SNDX-275-0601 open-label , Phase 1b/2 study evaluate combination entinostat plus pembrolizumab patient advance metastatic recurrent NSCLC melanoma . The study 2 phase , Dose Escalation/Confirmation Phase ( Phase 1b ) Expansion Phase ( Phase 2 ) . An additional cohort ( Entinostat Monotherapy Immune Correlate [ EMIC ] Cohort ) evaluate single agent entinostat 2 week follow combination also evaluate patient NSCLC Phase 2 expansion phase . Toxicities assess Investigator use United States ( US ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 4.03 . Dose Confirmation : The prospective MTD/RP2D identify Dose Escalation Phase confirm 9 patient Dose Confirmation Cohort ( ) obtain additional AE , immune correlate , anti-tumor activity data entinostat combination . Phase 2 ( Expansion ) : In Expansion Phase , entinostat combination evaluate use RP2D identify Dose Escalation/Confirmation Phase . Up 3 Expansion Cohorts consist distinct subset patient solid tumor cancer may explore . Expansion cohort may include : 1 . Cohort 1 : NSCLC 2 . Cohort 2 : Patients NSCLC ( histology ) previously treat respond progressed either PD-1 PD-L1-blocking antibody 3 . Cohort 3 : Patients melanoma previously treat unequivocally progress either PD-1 PD-L1-blocking antibody EMIC Cohort : 15 NSCLC patient Stage 2 Cohort 1 randomly assign participate .</detailed_description>
