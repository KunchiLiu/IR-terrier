	<brief_summary>Disease coronary artery kill people UK cause . The investigator develop computer system ( 'VIRTU ' ) predict blood pressure change inside coronary artery . This important ; - Doctors make good decision regard treat patient coronary artery disease blood pressure measurement - Currently , Doctors insert metal wire inside heart measure artery pressure time-consuming require special equipment , staff , train medicine . Although invasive technique save live money , 95 % patient receive procedure benefit provide . VIRTU provide solution problem since need X-ray picture require wire , drug , additional time , equipment staff . VIRTU test work need improve used patient . GOALS : Following , compare , pilot project ( ( Modelling significance coronary artery disease , STH 15740 ) : 1 . Improve VIRTU 's accuracy . 2 . Improve VIRTU 's speed . 3 . Test VIRTU patient complicate coronary disease . One hundred patient recruited angiography wait list consent attend angiography . The patient ask whether angiogram picture pressure measurement maybe use part data collection study . The data use validate develop VIRTU make 'patient-ready ' . VIRTU deliver advantage current invasive technique ( i.e . reduced death , heart attack cost ) , less invasive usable 100 % patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Plan Investigation Several interact workstreams proceed parallel observational , analytical , 36-month study University Sheffield ( UoS ) , Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ( STH ) , collaborator King 's College London ( KCL ) . This protocol document outline methodology clinical data collection patient attend STH . These ( fully anonymised ) clinical data use validate optimise use VIRTU improve accuracy speed well develop user-friendly interface . The development work take place within UoS KCL , impact NHS patient , staff premise clinical data collection describe ( subsequent workstreams detail Appendix 1 ) . 2 . Study design A phase II , observational , analytical study coronary angiography computational fluid dynamic 100 adult coronary artery disease undergo coronary angiography . 3 . Methodology ( Workstream 1 ) Clinical data collect Cardiac Catheter Laboratory ( CCL ) STH similar manner perform pilot project . Therefore , feasibility recruitment target model technique use study already demonstrate . In current study , 100 patient stable CAD pattern/severity , potentially suitable PCI , recruit . Potential participant identify member care team pre-admission clinic list cardiac catheter laboratory time diagnostic angiography referral another Cardiologist . These patient send patient information sheet . If interested finding study , patient meet Research Nurse Doctor discus project detail ask question . At pre-admission clinic Research Nurse Doctor take informed consent patient willing participate complete study recruitment log Clinical Details section Data Collection Form . The patient attend schedule PCI Northern General Hospital later date ( usually 2 -3 week pre-admission clinic ) . Details clinical procedure . During PCI member research team ( Dr Gunn , Dr Morton , Dr Morris Research Nurse ) record arterial diagrams procedure detail second part anonymised Data Collection Form . 4 . Clinical Procedure Selected patient ask undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging PCI , use standardise protocol . All clinical angiographic technique routine NHS clinical practice . No experimental technique use . Pre- post procedure care alter routine elective PCI care . The PCI proceed normal indicated , use best contemporary practice , include premedication . The study method routine use many patient undergoing PCI ; include rotational coronary angiography pressure wire deployment assess physiological significance lesion . This study merely require use systematically use standardise methodology . Rotational coronary angiography record standard single axis rotation ( cranial caudal leave coronary ; plane PA right coronary ) . An intravenous bolus 200mcg GTN give prior run . They do breath hold , rapid hand injection 10-20mL contrast . Also , standard , single plane , orthogonal , carefully select , angiogram record guide procedure . These perform baseline stent deployment . All major epicardial diseased vessel interrogate pressure wire ( Volcano Corporation ) . An infusion adenosine ( 140mcg/kg/min ) set attach intravenous cannula hand/arm . The pressure wire calibrate guide catheter pressure , introduce needle remove . The wire advance across lesion ( ) . A bolus 200mcg GTN give iv adenosine infusion start ( repeat necessary since adenosine short half life ) . When pressure stabilise , baseline pressure flow velocity record wire withdrawn , imaging , 1cm/sec . Stent implantation proceed accord clinical judgment operator , use angiographic appearance pressure gradient ( Fractional Flow Reserve ) across lesion interest arbiter . Standard criterion use ; namely stenosis appear &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis 2 orthogonal projection eye ( &gt; 70 % one ) and/or FFR &lt; 0.80 . The choice stent discretion operator . After stent deployment , rotational angiogram pressure wire pullback repeat , use method describe . In case multi-vessel disease , pullback repeat 2nd 3rd vessel . 5 . Setting project Clinical data collection happen 30 month period within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , Northern General Hospital . Cardiac Catheter Laboratory use procedure , posse single axis rotational angiography . 6 . Patient population One hundred patient recruit PCI wait list .</detailed_description>
