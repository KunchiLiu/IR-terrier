	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Hypotension occur commonly spinal anaesthesia caesarean section may result detrimental effect mother foetus . A previous pilot study image pulse oximeter waveform study take , find dicrotic wave move away systolic wave onset hypotension . AIMS : The investigator wish download electronic data describe pulse oximeter pulse wave accurately assess movement diastolic wave relative systolic wave spinal anaesthesia caesarean section . METHODOLOGY : 20 woman undergo caesarean section spinal anaesthesia recruit informed consent observational study . Data download pulse oximeter analyse identify movement dicrotic wave relative systolic wave relate change blood pressure . EXPECTED OUTCOMES : The investigator establish best way analyse change pulse oximeter waveform relationship change pulse oximeter waveform morphology onset hypotension spinal anaesthesia caesarean section . IMPLICATIONS : Analysis movement dicrotic wave could use anticipate thus avoid severe hypotension spinal anaesthesia caesarean section .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : When baby deliver surgical procedure ( caesarean section ) woman usually spinal anaesthetic . With spinal anaesthetic local anaesthetic inject spinal fluid make woman numb chest foot allow comfortable awake birth . One common side effect spinal anaesthetic woman 's blood pressure may fall make feel unwell ( rarely ) cause stress unborn baby . During caesarean section blood pressure usually measure every minute use cuff around upper arm . However , blood pressure may fall quickly detect timely fashion intermittent mean . One monitor use case call pulse oximeter . When attached patient 's finger detect pulse rate much oxygen blood . The pulse oximeter also produce image pulse wave finger . There one pulse wave every time heart beat two component . The main part wave ( systolic wave ) cause heart beat second part wave ( dicrotic wave ) result energy heart beat bounce back blood vessel . In previous study use digital camera take image pulse oximeter monitor screen could record change shape pulse wave . We find patient ' blood pressure fell dicrotic wave move away systolic wave . We intend load electronic data make pulse oximeter waveform , analyse change occur accurately . We believe fall blood pressure may detect early use analysis movement dicrotic wave standard monitoring . This currently blood pressure measure intermittently whereas pulse oximeter waveform display continuously . Drugs could give promptly stop blood pressure fall low woman feel unwell unborn baby affect . AIMS : Our aim observe change position dicrotic wave spinal anaesthesia caesarean section relate occurrence low blood pressure . METHODOLOGY : Following ethical approval 20 woman undergo caesarean section spinal anaesthesia recruit write informed consent . In theatre electronic data describe pulse oximeter waveform download mean data logger . In parallel , manually record perioperative data include blood pressure . We use data establish best way accurately reproducibly identify dicrotic wave move relation onset low blood pressure . As observational study , management case discretion attend anaesthetist discussion patient alter inclusion study . EXPECTED OUTCOMES : 1 . We establish best way detect movement dicrotic wave . 2 . We establish temporal relationship movement dicrotic wave fall blood pressure spinal anaesthesia caesarean section . IMPLICATIONS : Anaesthetists able use movement dicrotic wave anticipate avert low blood pressure spinal anaesthesia caesarean section .</detailed_description>
