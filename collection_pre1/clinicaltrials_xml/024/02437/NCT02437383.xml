	<brief_summary>Purpose : Primary : To evaluate efficacy extended-release propranolol compare placebo reduce pain patient temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . Secondary : To determine extended-release propranolol efficacy varies accord participant ' catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) genetic diplotype . Exploratory : To investigate whether effect extended-release propranolol incidence adverse effect , use rescue medication , pain index varies accord polymorphism noncoding region COMT , adrenergic receptor β2 ( ADRβ2 ) , adrenergic receptor β3 ( ADRβ3 ) gene . Participants : 200 patient chronic TMD randomly assign , 1:1 parallel , double-blind fashion , receive either extended-release propranolol placebo one three study site : University North Carolina-Chapel Hill School Dentistry ; University Florida-Gainesville College Dentistry ; State University New York Buffalo School Dental Medicine . Procedures ( method ) : Randomization either propranolol placebo . The 10-week study treatment period divide : 1 week drug titration , 8 week drug maintenance , 1 week drug tapering . The titration taper dos 60 mg ( capsule ) per day orally ; maintenance dose 60 mg twice per day orally . Participants attend 6 clinic visit 12-15 week follow : screening baseline visit ( Visit [ V ] 0 , 7-21 day prior V1 ) ; randomization start treatment ( titration ) ( V1 , study day 0 ) ; maintenance visit 2 ( V2 , 1 week post-randomization , study day 7+3 ) ; maintenance visit 3 ( V3 , 5 week post-randomization , study day 35 +/- 7 ) ; taper visit ( V4 , 9 week post-randomization , study day 63 +/- 7 ) ; taper visit 5 ( V5 , 11 week post-randomization 1 week drug taper end , study day 77 +/- 7 ) . Depending visit , procedure include : review medical history , weekly alcohol consumption , concomitant therapy medication , adverse event , compliance , eligibility ; administration/review questionnaire ; blood draw ; pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ; dispense study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>`` Temporomandibular disorder '' ( TMD ) encompass musculoskeletal disorder masticatory system include myalgia , arthralgia , temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) disc displacement , TMJ degenerative joint disease . The prevalence TMD range 6 % 12 % general population , muscle dysfunction prevalent TMD diagnostic group . TMD associate substantial disability suffer negatively impact quality life . Jaw pain common symptom compels treatment seek . In addition facial pain , TMD patient frequently report comorbid pain condition headache , low back pain , fibromyalgia . New approach TMD therapy urgently need improve clinical outcome reduce economic impact disorder . There currently FDA-approved product label specifically manage/treat TMD ; however , class drug use relieve TMD-associated pain , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , anti-inflammatory drug , corticosteroid , benzodiazepine , sedative hypnotic , muscle relaxant , opioids , antidepressant , anticonvulsant - although evidence establish efficacy safety population scarce . Practitioners ' justification use may base poorly control clinical trial clinical trial pain disorder acute postsurgical dental pain , arthritic pain , chronic lower back pain , neuropathic pain . Thus , need control clinical trial well understand physiological mechanism responsible TMD symptom . Evidence suggest enhance β-adrenergic drive contributes pathogenesis TMD complex persistent pain condition . For example , individual myofascial pain condition elevate catecholamine level augment sympathetic response stressor . While increased β-adrenergic drive appear heighten pain , β-adrenergic antagonist reduce clinical pain and/or nociceptive sensitivity . A recent study single infusion propranolol TMD fibromyalgia patient reveal short-term improvement clinical pain rating . The antagonist pindolol similarly efficacious alleviate cardinal symptom fibromyalgia pain . In addition , intramuscular injection low-dose propranolol rat reduce inflammatory pain associate carrageen-induced inflammation gastrocnemius muscle . The study hypothesis therapy nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol extended-release capsule ( FDA approve treat many cardiac condition , tremor , migraine , pheochromocytoma ) provide efficacious safe treatment painful TMD . It well-studied pharmacodynamic , pharmacokinetic , side-effect profile . Peak blood level occur approximately 6 hr , plasma half-life approximately 10 hr . The primary objective investigate efficacy propranolol compare placebo 10 week reduce pain patient TMD . Secondary objective : investigate treatment group whether reduction pain varies accord polymorphism COMT gene cod region ; investigate effect propranolol compare placebo affect pain sensitivity , physical emotional function , adverse effect , use rescue medication . Exploratory objective : investigate gene-by treatment group interaction determine effect propranolol incidence adverse effect , use rescue medication , reduction pain index accord polymorphism COMT , ADRβ2 , ADRβ3 genetic coding region .</detailed_description>
