	<brief_summary>In Senegal , iron deficiency affect 39 % 82 % woman child 12 50 month indicate iron deficiency major health problem . The government Senegal implement flour fortification program include iron folate . Iron difficult mineral add food efficiently due organoleptic property typical low bioavailability man . The aim study determine iron absorption fortify wheat flour consume phenolic contain beverage woman child pair . The fortificants use Ferrous Fumarate Ferrous Sulfate , effect absorption inhibitor bioavailability iron compound readily bioavailable poorly investigate . The bioavailability different iron compound determine use stable iron isotope . Sixteen pair woman child ( n=34 , child 3-6 year , woman 18-45y ) select participation study . After screen , woman child receive 4 test meal consist bread roll fortify stable isotope without tisane beverage . The first two test meal consume consecutive day . Two week second test meal blood sample take woman child third meal administration . After forth test meal administration , two week later , last blood sample take place study conduct subject ( duration 30 day ) . The sample send Zurich dry ice analysis follow parameter : isotopic composition , H pylorus infection , B vitamin status , Vitamin A status . In sample , hemoglobin iron status well inflammation status ( CRP ) determine .</brief_summary>
