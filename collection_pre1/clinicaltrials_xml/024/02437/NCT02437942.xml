	<brief_summary>Athletic groin pain ( AGP ) chronic condition common multi-directional sport ( Walden et al . 2007 , Robinson et al . 2004 , Murphy et al . 2012 ) . It complex injury challenge diagnosis . Dramatic difference anatomical diagnosis AGP cohort exist literature ( Renstrom et al . 1980 , Lovell et al . 1995 , Holmich et al . 2007 , Bradshaw et al . 2008 ) . This may due complexity anatomy region absence magnetic resonance imaging ( MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE ) confirm clinical examination . Dynamic action undertaken field sport ( include change direction cut ) particularly associate development athletic groin pain ( Holmich et al . 2014 ) . Dynamic multi-plane , multi-joint action overload musculoskeletal fascial structure hip groin . Despite , traditional groin pain assessment involve examination sport specific action . An examination jumping , hop cut mechanic , possible use three dimensional motion capture technique , provide additional information diagnosis rehabilitate athlete . While majority publish study AGP focus surgical management ( Serner et al . 2015 ) , exercise therapy find effective treatment ( Holmich et al . 1995 ) . In exercise therapy study best result show Holmich et al ( 1995 ) subject suffer average 9.9 month symptoms strength stability program focus adductor strength return sport 18.5 week . The late paper rehabilitation Jardi et al . demonstrate little improvement mean time return train 86 day +/-15 . The focus remain improve strength isolated muscle group attempt address underlie biomechanical abnormality may lead overload . Accurate biomechanical assessment individualize rehabilitation base high speed multiplanar movement drive athlete 's symptom may enhance efficiency rehabilitation . Moreover post-rehabilitation change biomechanical factor may provide insight biomechanical factor associate AGP . The purpose study : 1 . Describe clinical presentation ( physical examination magnetic resonance imaging finding ) group athletes present AGP 2 . To describe different biomechanical diagnosis exist AGP patient 3 . To examine effect biomechanics lead exercise intervention rehabilitate chronic groin pain It hypothesise standardise magnetic resonance imaging aid anatomical diagnosis athletic groin pain patient . From biomechanics perspective , distinct subgroups/clusters exist differ undertake dynamic sport specific action . These distinct cluster describe potential biomechanical diagnosis exist groin pain patient . A biomechanics led rehabilitation program return groin pain patient back sport quickly previous rehabilitation program without biomechanical diagnostic information . Brief protocol Participants recruit patient chronic athletic groin pain present investigation rehabilitation Sports Surgery Clinic , Ireland . A standardised clinical examination undertaken include range motion assessment , pain provocation load tolerance test , palpation . A Magnetic Resonance Image hip groin region undertake read consultant sport physician . Biomechanical assessment include capture jumping , hop cut mechanic use three dimensional motion capture technology force plate . Here reflective marker place skin anatomical landmark . These marker pick camera track 200 frame per second . Participants contact force plate foot undertaking movement . Force marker data combine calculate joint angle moment . Physical therapy assessment include assessment functional movement , range motion testing , adductor squeeze test , strength assessment hip trunk . Physiotherapists utilise three dimensional biomechanical data cut landing inform individualise rehabilitation . Rehabilitation consist movement control , whole body strength power , linear run mechanic , multi-directional mechanic condition session . Participants follow physical therapy appointment approximately every two week . A hip groin outcome score ( HAGOS ) use monitor morbidity severity injury throughout rehabilitation process . Once physiotherapist determines patient ready return play biomechanical re-test undertaken .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed Protocol The following assessment undertaken consultant sport physician initial clinical examination : - Hip joint range motion ( flexion , internal external rotation ) - Flexion ADduction Internal Rotation ( FADIR ) Flexion ABduction External Rotation ( FABER ) test - Squeeze test ( resist adduction ) 90 , 45 0 degree perform ( SQ90° , SQ45° SQ0° respectively ) - Resisted sit - Prone internal external rotation - Gaenslen 's test - Hip extension - Femoral slump - Thomas test - Palpation adductor insertion tubercle , pubic symphysis superficial ring resist oblique sit deep ring scrotal invagination - The crossover test Radiological examination include magnetic resonance image ….. Biomechanical test involves follow progressive neuromuscular challenge test undertake clinical examination : - Countermovement jump - Vertical jump high possible - Single leg drop land - Hop 30cm height onto one leg hold land 2sec - Hurdle hop - Lateral hop 15cm hurdle follow hop back start position hold 2sec - Change direction cut - Sprint 5 metre , make 75 degree acute change direction sprint five meter finish - Indecision cut - Sprint three meter react light stimulus make 90 degree cut leave right 1.5metres Questionnaires - Hip groin outcome score ( HAGOS ) - Marx activity rating scale Physical therapy assessment : - Single leg squat - Straight leg raise - Hip strength test - Hip range motion - Squeeze test - Crossover test - Linear run analysis Rehabilitation Details Movement Control Focusing deficit large compound movement pattern evident assessment well hip trunk control deficit . High emphasis place technical quality session carry . Particular focus pelvic control improve sagittal frontal plane hip lumbopelvic control . Any symptoms exercise indicate poor technique exercise review intensity reduce appropriate technique achieve . The rep set range reflect emphasis control improve range thoracic spine , hip ankle . Strength-Power Double leg single leg strength training carry necessary . Good form instruct throughout ensure appropriate hip strategy especially high load . Power work include single leg plyometric exercise reduce ground contact improve stiffness throughout kinetic chain . Linear Running Linear run drill focus optimize lumbo pelvic control three plane identify assessment . Commence wall drill march skip progress onto sled harness drill facilitate develop optimal posture increase rate force development ground reaction force improve performance . Multi Directional Multidirectional drill use provide neuromuscular challenge trunk pelvis hip control well optimize foot position ability control centre mass relative stance leg reduce hip pelvic overload optimise cut performance . Higher intensity cut drill include progression painfree squeeze 90 degree achieve symmetrical hip internal rotation bilaterally . Conditioning With view ensure aspect athletes performance address , condition carry stationary bike allow sufficient intensity without overload pubic/groin region . Sessions prescribe Maximal Aerobic Power assessment wattbike focus alternate maximal supramaximal session . Hip Groin Outcome Score ( HAGOS ) MARX activity rating scale A HAGOS MARX questionnaire complete groin patient every visit -approximately every two week . Patient Registry Patient data inputted iMedDoc medical data management software . Captured data include : Patient information - doubly de-identified patient code , electronic scan consent form , anthropometric data , sport , play position play level , time pain , pain side bilateral pain .
