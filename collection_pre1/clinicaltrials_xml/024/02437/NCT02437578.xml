	<detailed_description>Background Today , evident vitamin D widespread effect classical action relate bone mineralization calcium homeostasis . Vitamin D deficiency result impaired reproductive performance various specie animal , recently investigator show vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , activate ( CYP2R1 , CYP27A1 , CYP27B1 ) inactivating ( CYP24A1 ) enzymes expressed human testis , epididymis , seminal vesicle , prostate spermatozoon . Functional study show activated vitamin D increase intracellular calcium sperm motility mature spermatozoon , hence may important spermatogenesis also sperm function . A cross sectional study 300 young healthy Danish men show men low level serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly low number normally develop motile spermatozoon . Hitherto , case male infertility classify `` idiopathic '' , infertile couple refer symptomatic treatment infertility clinic . These fertility treatment often physically demand female partner well expensive health care system . Any test might assist guide treatment infertile couple would beneficial infertile couple society general . Our finding vitamin D may play role human semen quality test clinically . If vitamin D supplementation prove efficient open first time causal , safe cheap treatment least case `` idiopathic '' impaired semen quality . This may consequences vitamin D may use select high quality sperm assist reproductive technique . The presence vitamin D receptor vitamin D metabolize enzymes particular CYP24A1 able discriminate sperm normal infertile men . CYP24A1 express annulus normal sperm virtually absent spermatozoon infertile men . This indicate CYP24A1 may use marker discriminate good unhealthy sperm may therefore serve predictive clinical marker fertility . This indicate CYP24A1 expression also may assist predict chance success use insemination ( IUI ) , IVF ICSI . CYP24A1 expression induce activated vitamin D VDR , indicate VDR activate gene also may serve positive predictive marker fertility . In addition simple use VDR , CYP24A1 vitamin D regulate gene human sperm clinical marker , also important determine function vitamin D reproduction . In order understand , important determine concentration vitamin D metabolites male female reproductive tract . For instance vitamin D metabolites undetectable male reproductive tract measurable female reproductive tract may important signal capacitate ( activate ) spermatozoon . The different vitamin D metabolites factor female reproductive tract measure determine alone combinaton marker may good predictor success follow IUI , IVF , ICSI treatment . The suggested clinical trial may therefore able evaluate several secondary endpoint addition CYP24A1 search predictive marker fertilization . For instance several biomarkers serum , seminal plasma follicular fluid conjunction know polymorphisms several gene important reproductive function . For instance genetic variation FSH signaling . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) relate gene encode FSHβ subunit ( FSHB ) FSH receptor ( FSHR ) affect FSH production ( FSHB c.-211 G &gt; T ) sensitivity/expression receptor vitro ( FSHR c.2039A &gt; G &amp; FSHR c.-29G &gt; A ) . FSHR c.2039A &gt; G , FSHR c.-29G &gt; A , associate increase FSH level adult woman , conflict result FSHB c.-211 G &gt; T ( 7 ; 8 ) . May polymorphism specific polymorphism affect male female fertility potential , semen quality reproductive hormone . SETTING , SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND RECRUITMENT Participants include among infertile couple refer IUI , IVF ICSI Dansk fertilitetsklinik . The design prospective , blind , single center cohort study . The investigation sample blind since investigator information clinical data , treatment failure/succes . participant follow 9 month treatment evaluate live birth rate , abortion etc . PARTICIPANTS All refer infertile couple invite participate , however partner &gt; 18 year woman &lt; 43 year old . woman use donorinsemination also include . Anticipated 800-1000 IUI 400 IVF/ICSI conduct clinic study period . The investigator assume 600 IUI 200 IVF/ICSI wish participate . Thus , 800 treatment target inclusion study . The investigator expect small retraction rate ( &lt; 20 ) high motivation adverse effect . ANALYSIS Reproductive hormone , genetic analysis , endocrine disrupters growth factor analyze dept . GR , Rigshospitalet calcium regulator include vitamin D metabolites Holbæk hospital . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS The power estimate base publish data CYP24A1 positive marker semen quality . The association clinical pregnancy CYP24A1 estimate comparable association sperm motility . This imply N=600 IUI enough evaluate effect CYP24A1 marker pregnancy live birth rate investigator estimate least 12 % positive pregnancy test . When inital collection raw semen/percoll separate sperm data complete additional amount clinical observation obtain 9 month live birth rate , abortion etc . Secondary analysis putative association clinical endpoint expression VDR Vitamin D regulate genesin sperm investigate randomly select subset sample N=300 . All list genetic analysis conduct men woman DNA . Follicular fluid collect IVF ICSI contamination blood . Analyses different marker follicular fluid cell associate oocyte quality , pregnancy live birth rate . ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All patient finish inital visit investigation , invite participate study . The loss spermatozoon man result make cytospin influence successrate IUI , IVF ICSI investigator take less 2.5 % sperm pool . PUBLICATION OF RESULTS All result , positive negative submit peer review scientific journal . Data successively obtain transferred statistical database . Predefined subgroup analysis Female age , sperm concentration , TTP , BMI , expression CYP24A1/VDR sperm , raw semen verus percoll separate , serum vitamin D level list genetic polymorphism secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
