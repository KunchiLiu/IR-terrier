	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect preliminary data whether drug adalimumab ( also call Humira ) decrease pain stiffness , improve quality life , safe people mucopolysaccharidosis type I , II , VI . In study people randomly assign one two group . One group treat adalimumab first 16 week study saline injection last 16 week study . The group start saline injection 16 week switch adalimumab last 16 week . The study subject study doctor study coordinator know group subject study do . Adalimumab give injection , skin , every 2 week . Both group blood draw screen visit , 7 time 32 week study . There safety lab do ( liver immune function test ) . Other safety test include chest X-ray screening tuberculosis exposure - do screen visit later study concern tuberculosis exposure persistent cough . The follow also do screening , first , middle , last study visit : 1 ) pregnancy test girl 8 old , 2 ) questionnaire ask pain , MPS impact social physical function , quality life question , 3 ) height weight . Finally , physical exam , include child adolescent check puberty , do study physician first , middle , last visit . There risk take adalimumab include redness pain injection give , decreased ability fight infection , others . The safety test design identify decrease risk associate adalimumab . The study physician believe potential benefit adalimumab pain , quality life , MPS relate problem outweigh potential risk treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , pilot study consist 32-week , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled treatment phase subject Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) type I , II VI treat enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) and/or hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . Subjects treat adalimumab ( group 1 ) placebo ( group 2 ) 16 week ( i.e. , 8 dos ) cross group 16 week . Subjects treat adalimumab ( 20 mg [ weight 15- &lt; 30 kg ] 40 mg [ weight ≥30 kg ] administer subcutaneously [ subQ ] every week ) placebo 16 week , cross-over group 16 week . Laboratory evaluations Children 's Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50 ( CHQ-PF50 ) subject &lt; 18 year age Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) subject ≥18 year assess Week 16 32 evaluate early treatment safety efficacy . Safety assess laboratory evaluation 4 , 8 , 20 , 24 week treatment initiation , study visit week 16 32 , Physical function measure CHQ-PF50/SF-36 , joint range motion ( ROM ) , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , strength testing ( hand-grip dynamometer ) baseline , 16 , 32 week . Joint inflammation measure serum marker baseline , 16 , 32 week . Anthropometric measurement also perform Baseline 16 32 week .</detailed_description>
