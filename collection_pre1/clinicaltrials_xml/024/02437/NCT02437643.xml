	<detailed_description>Obese old adult ( ≥60 yrs ) moderate functional impairment randomize 1 2 study arm . Outcomes measure 0 , 3 6 month follow : Primary outcomes— ( 1 ) Muscle Quality ( MQ ) : muscle power ( time perform ten chair rise , height chair , leg length , body mass , acceleration gravity ) relation muscle mass ( CT-scan ) ( 2 ) Muscle adipose infiltration ( MAI ) ( CT-scan ) . Secondary outcomes- Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ; DXA scan ) physical function ( Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) ; 6 minute walk ; 8-foot go ; 30 second chair stand ; handgrip strength ; body weight ; fat mass ; waist circumference ; activity ( accelerometer ) ; mental health ( sleep , depression , quality life ) ; feasibility factor ( adherence , protein intake , nutrition adequacy ) . BMD access 0 6 month . Study Arms : - Weight loss plus low-intensity exercise intervention ( WL-LoEX ; n = 35 ) : Subjects follow calorie-reduction diet weight loss ≥10 % , protein~0.8g/g/d . Subjects also participate three 30-minute low-intensity exercise session weekly . One serve dairy protein/day provide WL-LoEX participant . - High protein weight loss plus low-intensity exercise intervention ( PRO-WL-LoEX ; n = 35 ) : Subjects follow calorie-reduction diet weight loss ≥10 % , high proportion high quality protein meal . Intakes &gt; 30g protein achieve three time day subject group , predominantly animal source ( high quality ) 60-70 % animal protein dairy food provide . Subjects also participate three 30-minute low-intensity exercise session weekly .</detailed_description>
