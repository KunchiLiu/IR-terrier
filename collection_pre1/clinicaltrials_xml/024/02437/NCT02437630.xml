	<brief_summary>In study investigator aim investigate extent patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease narrow vocal cord cause positive pressure within airway thus improve airflow lung function . This information capture upright lie position estimate magnitude effect form offsetting pressure ask patient breathe use commercially available device use treat sleep apnoea call CPAP machine . This observational study observation laryngeal aperture , mouth oesophageal pressure differ level apply CPAP record analysis patient COPD normal subject without COPD . All measurement , observation , intervention allow u observe measure pressure , laryngeal aperture , airflow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrinsic PEEP Laryngeal Aperture COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) flow limitation inherent condition cause gas trap consequently over-inflation lung term hyperinflation worsens exercise . Expiratory airflow maximize intrinsic positive pressure lung ( Positive end expire pressure , PEEP ) offset externally apply pressure ( Expiratory positive airway pressure , EPAP ) note patient COPD purse lip breathe expiration . The applicant show preliminary study patient COPD also close vocal cord expiration hypothesise function glottic narrowing provide external positive expiratory pressure thus reduce flow limitation . Relatively data exist laryngeal airflow human . One therapy increasingly use treatment acute chronic respiratory failure non invasive pressure ventilation . Devices use oscillate high Inspiratory positive airway pressure ( IPAP ) low Expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) remain uncertainty best titrate EPAP . We speculate optimum EPAP would one reduce glottic narrowing basis would optimise expiratory flow reduce drive glottic narrowing . The aim study test hypothesis identify range external apply EPAP minimise glottic narrow COPD patient erect supine position . Technical advance use continuous laryngoscopic examination ( CLE ) provide feasible safe method directly observe laryngeal movement fix position . We aim measure intra-thoracic pressure use oesophageal balloon respiration relate CLE movement larynx . At time measure airflow volume pneumotachograph . This allow u identify effect glottic narrow intra-thoracic pressure see glottic narrowing lead increase positive end expire pressure chest ( positive end expire pressure intrathoracic , PEEPi ) extent offset use EPAP deliver positive pressure machine ( continuous positive airway pressure , CPAP ) . The design study one visit physiological study observational study blind investigator participant . We intend study 10 control normal lung function history COPD 20 patient COPD . They attend single 3 hour period start full explanation procedure undertake informed consent obtain aspect investigation one investigator fully train obtain consent research project . The subject examine lung function test already carry previous 6 week The subject seat armchair application local anaesthetic nose assist swallow oesophageal balloon catheter deflate state insert via nostril assist sipping water whilst balloon swallow . The position balloon identify measure length swallow position low third oesophagus . A small quantity air introduce balloon ( 1.0ml ) inflate balloon tube connect pressure measure device situate next chair . Next subject introduce nostril fibre-optic laryngoscope pass direct vision back throat larynx movement see The output laryngoscope record digitally . The subject place mouth nose modify facemask able breathe without difficulty modify admit measurement catheter . Attached mask pneumotachograph measure airflow tube allow pressure mouth vary . This allow movement larynx quiet breathe rest observe intra-thoracic pressure measure time airflow mouth record simultaneously . Once subject comfortable device relax chair record laryngeal movement , pressure airflow commence continue 5 minute . At end time subject ask make inspiratory capacity manoeuvre ( breathe far ) . Subsequently mouth pressure vary 1cm H2O ( 1cm H20 = pressure produce column water 1cm depth ) increment random order 0-15cm H2O 5 minute level . The protocol repeat subject lie flat catheter laryngoscope withdrawn .
