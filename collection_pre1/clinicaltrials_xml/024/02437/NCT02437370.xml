	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose pembrolizumab give together docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient previously treat urothelial cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced ) spread primary site ( place start ) place body ( metastatic ) . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pembrolizumab together docetaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride may better treatment urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Docetaxel Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) give combination docetaxel gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient advanced metastatic platinum-treated urothelial cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary manner efficacy combination ( overall response rate progression free survival ) . II . To determine exploratory manner program death ( PD ) -ligand ( L ) 1 expression archival tumor specimen correlate patient outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pembrolizumab . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ( Patients receive prior gemcitabine hydrochloride/cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride/carboplatin [ GC ] methotrexate , vinblastine sulfate , adriamycin , cisplatin [ MVAC ] therapy assign Arm A ) . ARM A : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . ARM B : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV Arm A gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
