	<brief_summary>Opioid dependence substantial problem associate significant morbidity mortality . Extended-release naltrexone find effective reduce opioid use maintain abstinence , use limited difficulty encounter treatment initiation , involve detoxification opioids oral naltrexone titration . Improving likelihood successful transition naltrexone therefore important public health goal . N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDA ) antagonism find alleviate sign symptom withdrawal opioids , well address adaptation associate chronic opioid use , opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( increase pain sensitivity ) . These benefit may persist least 72 hour single dose . NMDA antagonism may therefore facilitate rapid transition naltrexone reduce discomfort , improve motivation , ameliorate adaptation associate drug dependence , crave arousal . The purpose trial ass feasibility NMDA antagonist-assisted naltrexone initiation opioid dependent individual . After administration extended-release naltrexone , participant follow 4 week , transition appropriate care subsequently ( oral naltrexone , extended-release naltrexone ) .</brief_summary>
