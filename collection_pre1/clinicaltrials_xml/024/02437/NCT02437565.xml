	<brief_summary>Stainless steel crown arguably successful posterior restoration primary teeth 50 year . Stainless steel crown offer durability success rate excess 95 % make restoration choice posterior primary teeth child treat general anesthesia . Failures stainless steel crown place primary teeth document use several criterion include marginal adaptation , recurrent caries , abscess formation root resorption , loss crown due faulty retention even perforation crown . Despite probability factor root resorption failure endodontic treatment could due traumatic occlusion , surprisingly little evidence available literature attempt make check evaluate occlusion stainless steel crown place general anesthesia The aim study compare time take placement overall success bilateral multiple stainless crown place general anesthesia use occlusal index compare crown place without index , use randomize control study design</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Checking Occlusion During Stainless Steel Crown Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 60 patient ( 32 male 28 female ) age 4 7 year ( Mean age 4.8 year , SD +/- 1.09 year ) meet inclusion criterion recruit obtain informed consent parent . No financial incentive offer participation study . A total 51 ( 29 male 22 female ) patient complete six month follow requirement ( Fig 2 ) . Evaluation Crowns Procedure All patient evaluate 24 hour , one week , three month six month post-operatively . Clinical criterion evaluate include report pain , discomfort , difficulty mastication high point report patient . Tenderness percussion , presence premature mobility clinical evidence abscess fistula check one investigator ( SCP ) . Periapical digital radiograph take use digital sensor ( Schick Elite , Sirona Dental Inc. Long Island NY . USA ) evaluate examiner radiographic evidence failure . In order ensure blind investigator ( SCP ) record finding make aware group patient belong . The time take procedure calculated time placement throat pack time removal throat pack obtain intra-operative anesthesiologist note . If failure crown occur 3 month , teeth exclude 6 month evaluation . Statistical Analyses The parametric value control case group compare use student 's test . The non-parametric value control case group compare use Mann Whitney U test . All test conduct p value 0.05</detailed_description>
