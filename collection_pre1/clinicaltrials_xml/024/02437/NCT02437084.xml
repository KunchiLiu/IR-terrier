	<brief_title>Relationship Between Insulin Resistance Statin Induced Type 2 Diabetes , Integrative Personal Omics Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Specific Aims There general agreement although statin-treatment increase incidence type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) patient elevate plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration , benefit statin treatment significantly outweigh untoward side-effect . During last month two manuscript publish substantially increase understand link statin use incident T2DM . Thus , Swerdlow , et al. , base evidence genetic analysis randomize trial , conclude increase risk T2DM note statin least `` partially explain HMG-coenzyme A reductase ( HMGCR ) inhibition . '' They also note association weight gain HMGCR variant statin-treated patient , lead notion decrease insulin sensitivity contribute statin-induced diabetes . In context , Cederberg , al . recently show large prospective study ( n=8749 men ) participant treat statin ( n=2142 ) 46 % increase incident T2DM , associate 24 % decrease insulin sensitivity 12 % decrease insulin secretion . Since T2DM develop insulin resistant individual maintain degree compensatory hyperinsulinemia need maintain normal glucose tolerance , observation Cederberg , et al . provide mechanistic explanation statin-induced T2DM general level . However , significant fundamental question remain . For example , cellular/molecular link HMGCR activity change insulin action secretion describe Cederberg , et al . ? In context , relatively little attention give role metabolic heterogeneity patient elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration might play statin-induced T2DM . Specifically , subject elevate LDL-C concentration , whose plasma triglyceride ( TG ) concentration also elevate , insulin resistant , hyperinsulinemic , glucose intolerant compare isolated LDL-C level . As , subset patient elevate LDL-C concentration view `` tipping point , '' adverse effect statins insulin action/secretion , irrespective mediate , place enhance risk develop statin-induced diabetes . This proposal base premise identify subject prior statin treatment would substantial clinical benefit , investigator primary goal demonstrate simple measurement plasma TG concentration serve purpose . Consequently , investigator propose enroll nondiabetic volunteer , define high-risk T2DM , free know cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , receive statin , eligible statin therapy accord ACC/AHA ( American College Cardiology/American Heart Association ) 2013 guideline [ 4 ] , subdivide basis plasma TG concentration whose value either &lt; 1.7 mmol/L ( ↓TG/↑LDL ) ≥ 1.7 mmol/L ( ↑TG/↑LDL ) . Personal Omics Profiling ( iPOP ) Personalized medicine expect benefit combination genomic information global monitoring molecular component physiological state . To extend Dr. Snyder 's previous research integrate Personal Omics Profiling ( iPOP ) monitoring genomic , transcriptomic , proteomic , metabolomic , autoantibodyomic information , 21-month period include healthy two virally infected state , investigator propose analyze iPOP apparently healthy volunteer dyslipidemia longitudinally , , take drug . In pilot study , perform unprecedented depth omics analysis , analysis do previously-known drug 's efficacy also untargeted drug 's efficacy obtain good understanding perform personal omics profile take drug , would lead develop good use drug Hypothesis : The result demonstrate : 1 ) individual ↑TG/↑LDL concentration insulin resistant/hyperinsulinemic glucose intolerant , adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile , compare ↓TG/↑LDL concentration ; 2 ) statin treatment accentuate difference metabolic variable iPOP profile two experimental group . 2 . Significance , background Innovation ) Significance : The relationship statin treatment T2DM initially focus whether statin treatment increase risk T2DM ; clinical impact risk . More recently , attention give understanding statin increase risk T2DM , well clinical characteristic help identify increase risk order mount effort minimize adverse effect . a. Statins risk T2DM : There agreement statin treatment associate increase incident diabetes . This adverse outcome seem class effect , although Cho , et al . show risk new onset T2DM range 7.8 % ( pitavastatin ) 3.4 % ( simvastatin ) , intermediate rate atorvastatin pravastatin , rosuvastatin b . Mechanism statin-induced T2DM : Swerdlow , et al demonstrate importance reduce activity HMGCR pathogenesis statin-induced T2D , particular role genetic variant enhance weight gain decrease insulin sensitivity . However , give pleiotropic effect statin , good deal remain learn concern change HMGCR gene level modify insulin calorie-restricted diet , action/insulin secretion . Since Cederberg , et al . show insulin action insulin secretion decrease patient take statin , seem likely one multiple mechanism advance account T2DM statin-treated patient contribute adverse effect c. Identifying high LDL-C level enhance risk stain-induced T2DM : Results 3 randomized clinical trial atorvastatin demonstrate `` baseline fasting glucose , body mass index , hypertension , fast triglyceride independent predictor T2DM . '' These abnormality form cluster , initially refer Syndrome X attribute insulin-resistance . Since insulin resistance predictor develop T2DM seem likely insulin resistant treatment , great risk develop statin-induced diabetes . Individuals combined elevation LDL-C TG concentration insulin resistant glucose intolerant thereby increase risk T2DM . Furthermore , investigator demonstrate plasma TG concentration ≥1.7 mmol/L identify subset nondiabetic person elevate LDL-C concentration , judge baseline high risk T2DM , significantly insulin resistant , glucose intolerant , adverse CVD risk profile , normal TG concentration . There possible approach identify individual risk develop T2DM treat statin , e.g. , diagnosis metabolic syndrome [ MetS ] . Thus , comparison 291 apparently healthy individual data base , group together basis MetS vs. plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L , reveal comparable cardio-metabolic risk profile . For example , median fast plasma insulin concentration , excellent surrogate estimate insulin resistance almost identical individual MetS ( 13.05 µU/mL ) plasma TG ≥ 1.7 mmol ( 12.5 µU/mL ) . Given information , seem reasonable continue evaluate ability plasma TG concentration 1.7 mmol/L identify risk develop T2DM take statin . More specifically , combine understand phenotypic heterogeneity individual elevate LDL-C concentration quantification insulin action secretion address 2 important unanswered questions:1 ) plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L identify subset enhance risk T2DM CVD ; 2 ) impact statin administration insulin action secretion individual whose plasma TG concentration cut-point . ii ) innovation : 1 . The investigator believe wide-spread awareness two disparate phenotype individual elevate LDL-C concentration , differ dramatically degree glucose intolerance insulin resistance ; render combine elevation LDL-C TG concentration enhance risk statin-induced T2DM . This proposal first prospective study impact statin therapy glucose tolerance , insulin action/secretion , lipid/lipoprotein metabolism compare two phenotype . 2 . The investigator unaware previous evaluation adverse effect statin glucose tolerance insulin action/secretion individual enrol fulfil predefined criterion high risk T2DM . This population choose retrospective analysis indicate plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L identify glucose intolerant insulin resistant . Thus , volunteer enrol study classify high-risk criterion outline ADA ( American Diabetes Association ) criterion . 3 . As indicated , investigator believe phenotypic heterogeneity subject elevate LDL-C concentration well-recognized . Not result study emphasize point , iPOP profile obtain , statin treatment may give u potential genetic modulation responsible difference , well impact gene expression level mechanism potentially involved adverse effect statin carbohydrate metabolism . c ) Research Approach 1 . Overview : This pilot study open-label , parallel group , 2-arm study , evaluate diabetogenic effect atorvastatin ( 40 mg/day 8 week ) nondiabetic individual isolated increase LDL-C concentration ( ↓TG/↑LDL ) vs. combine increase LDL-C TG concentration ( ↑TG/↑LDL ) . The experimental population consist 20 apparently healthy volunteer , select satisfy 2 fundamental criterion : 1 ) Increased risk T2DM ADA Standards Care [ 15 ] , 2 ) LDL-C concentration ≥ 3.4 mmol/L . The experimental population subdivide group 10 basis TG concentration &lt; 1.7 mmol/L ( ↓TG/↑LDL ) ≥ 1.7 mmol/L ( ↑TG/↑LDL ) . Following baseline comparison two group , participant place weight maintenance diet , treat 40 mg/day atorvastatin , baseline measurement repeat 8 week later iPOP measurement do baseline , week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 one month atorvastatin . The goal study : 1 ) compare number cardio-metabolic characteristic 2 group administration atorvastatin ; 2 ) demonstrate significant deterioration insulin action and/or secretion well cardio-metabolic risk factor follow statin treatment confine combined ↑TG/↑LDL concentration baseline ; 3 ) correlate baseline post-statin change cardio-metabolic characteristic . 4 ) Perform Personal Omics Profiling ( iPOP ) 2 group take statin compare two group term treatment-associated change baseline variable within group across group analyze previously-known drug 's efficacy also untargeted drug 's efficacy .</detailed_description>
