Study Design The total number patient automatically assign two group : Group A consist patient score paper-pencil version clinical visit version PROactive tool . Group B consist patient score electronic version clinical visit version PROactive tool . Randomization stratify site . In addition , control group ( Group C ) participate rehabilitation program include time patient Group A B able independently address study objective 2 3 4 . Group C also randomize pape-pencil version electronic version . Following completion first week ( i.e . : V1 ) patient complete multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program . Following completion rehabilitation program patient perform one visit ( V2 ) . During visit 1 2 patient perform measurement indicate tab Rehabilitation program The rehabilitation program multidisciplinary include mandatory supervised exercise training appropriate training intensity , component program breathing control relaxation technique , method clearance pulmonary secretion , disease education , dietary advice , psychological support issue relate chronic disability . Six minute walking test , improvement dyspnea sensation ( CRDQ ) use benchmark effect program provide give team . Data management Patient data store randomized database WP2D . Data analyze centrally relevant PRO data accessory end point available format allow integration PROactive WP6 study . Assessments Primary outcome PROactive tool Physical activity measurement term daily number step vector magnitude unit ( VMU ) perform primarily `` Actigraph '' triaxial activity monitor whilst patient answer clinical visit questionaire Proactive tool well PROactive questionnaire ( i.e . CCQ , CRQ , HADS , CAT , SGRQ ) . Additionally , subgroup patient assign three group ( i.e . Group A , B , C ) activity monitoring measurement term walk intensity perform Minimod ( McRoberts BV ) activity monitor . Secondary outcome Anthropometrics-Body composition Body weight measure near 0.1 kg digital scale height measure near 0.5 cm stadiometer . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate ratio weight ( kilogram ) height ( metre ) square . Body composition estimate bioelectric impedance device . Recording data : Recording follow parameter : weight , height , total body water , fat mass ( FM ) , fat free mass ( FFM ) . Lung function Spirometry , body plethysmography single breath transfer factor carbon dioxide measure accord American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society standard administer 400Î¼g salbutamol ( 3 ) . Post bronchodilator static lung volume assess use body-box ( whole body plethysmography ) . Recording data : Recording follow parameter : FEV1 FVC , TLC , RV , TGV TLco . Exercise capacity Incremental exercise test The incremental exercise test perform electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer ( Ergoline 800 ; Sensor Medics , Anaheim , CA , USA ) ramp increase load increments 5 25 Watt/min patient reach volitional exhaustion . Recording data : Recording follow parameter : peak work rate , peak oxygen uptake , peak heart rate , minute ventilation Iso-Work peak minute ventilation , SpO2 , dyspnea sensation leg discomfort ( 10-Borg scale ) . Six-minute walk test The 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) measure follow instruction American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) recommendation . Recording data : Before exercise test : heart rate , SpO2 , dyspnea sensation leg discomfort ( 10-Borg scale ) distance walk . Skeletal muscle function test Patients study seated quad chair , hip knee flexion 90 degree . An inextensible strap place around ankle , immediately proximal malleoli , adjust ensure knee remain 90 degree flexion .
