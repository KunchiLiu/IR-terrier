	<brief_summary>The prevalence heart diseases increase significantly recent year health public problem due increase risk death several reason . A cardiac surgery alternative treatment critical injury heart valves coronary artery . Changes respiratory system result cardiac surgery well establish include reduce functional capacity due post-surgical pain , cause increase respiratory function increase oxygen consumption . The exercise cycle ergometer phase I cardiac rehabilitation improve peripheral muscle strength , functional capacity perception dyspnea use postoperatively speculation earlier carry contribute well postoperative evolution patient , benefit phase I Rehabilitation Cardiac well define literature . Objective : To evaluate exercise effect ergometer cycle postoperative course patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Method : Patients recruit cardiac surgery service Polyclinic Pato Branco city Pato Branco state Paraná , sex , appropriate inclusion criterion , evaluate pulmonary function test ( strength respiratory muscle , submaximal exercise test , dyspnea scale , laboratory test radiological exam ) . All patient randomly assign one two group : control group ( Conventional treatment ) rehabilitation group ( conventional treatment +cycle ergometer ) , 7 day postoperative period . Patients reevaluate third postoperative day discharge . Clinical evolution data collect record note medical staff monitoring physiotherapist .</brief_summary>
