	<brief_summary>Salivary fistula bane surgical salvage era primary chemoradiation head neck ( H &amp; N ) cancer . The `` blame '' prior chemoradiation tissue damage encourage compensatory surgical technique focus insertion non-irradiated tissue field . This study emphasize paradigm shift understand treatment pharyngocutaneous fistula . The detrimental effect salivary enzyme tissue heal surgical anastomosis address novel treatment strategy outline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide VS Placebo Prevention Salivary Fistulae After Post Radiation Salvage Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After sign informed consent form , patient schedule total laryngectomy composite resection oral/pharyngeal/laryngeal malignant tumor , randomly divide two group ten . The control group receive placebo study group receive octreotide . All involve care patient patient blind drug give . The rest treatment equal group adhere current departmental protocol Otolaryngology/Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery . The studied drug ( Octreotide 100 mcg s/c ) placebo administer even prior surgery subsequently two week thrice daily basis . Both group remain hospital postoperatively minimum two week period ( current common practice ) . In addition daily wind assessment , include daily grade pharyngocutaneous fistula ( use grade system ) , patient also evaluate : Serology : 1 . Complete blood count biochemistry include CRP amylase assess every 3 day . 2 . GlucoChecks perform daily . Imaging : 1 . Patients abdominal ultrasound examine gallbladder prior follow completion two-weeks therapy . Admission stay : Fistula prevention acceleration heal reflect admission time ; generally , patient fistulae suffer prolonged hospital stay . Quality Life Evaluation : Evaluation patient ' quality life base two assessment score : 1 . Pain evaluation : Patients rate average head neck region pain intensity 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) ( comprise 11 integer include 0 ) , 0 `` pain '' 10 represent `` bad pain possible '' . Assessment include record 'current NRS '-representing current pain 'NRS maximum ' represent maximal recall pain last six month . The NRS highly correlate pain assessment scale valid , reliable easy use tool clinical dental practice . 2 . Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) questionnaire : The validated Hebrew version short OHIP ( Oral Health Impact Profile ) questionnaire ( OHIP-14 ) use assess Oral health-related quality life ( OHRQoL ) . For OHIP-14 question , subject ask frequently experience impact last six month . Responses make 5 point ordinal scale : 0—never , 1—hardly ever , 2—occasionally , 3— fairly often , 4—very often . OHRQoL impairment characterize OHIP-14 global score , potential range 0 ( adverse impact within last six month ) 56 ( 14 impact experience often within last six month ) . The OHIP-14 include seven conceptual dimension oral health relate quality life . The dimension functional limitation , physical pain , psychological discomfort , physical disability , psychological disability , social disability handicap . OHIP-14 domain calculate domain sum response score two correspond item . Relationships OHIP-14 score various socio-demographic parameter , health-related behavior pain score assess among study population . CBCT sialography : On order monitor progression salivary gland heal process cone beam computorized tomography ( CBCT ) sialography implement . Saliva collection analysis : Patients 2 group ask eat , drink brush teeth hour saliva collection . Thereafter , saliva secretion rate affect parotid gland ( operative side ) measure 8 12 AM use Carlson-Crittenden collector . Prior placement cup , buccal mucosa dry gauze Stensen 's duct slightly squeeze locate duct ' orifice . Salivary flow stimulate 2 % citric acid . Saliva collect total time 5 minute . Samples keep ice saliva collection . Thereafter , sample centrifuge 14,000 rpm 20 min 4°C . Supernatant collect protein concentration determine accord Bradford ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Several component secrete saliva assess include : Cortisolamylase , cytokine , growth factor , elastases proteinase . Octreotide level saliva also assess . In addition , sialochemical analysis Na+ , K+ , Cl- , Ca2+ , PO43- , Mg2+ concentration perform . Proteomic analysis : Depending protein concentration analysis may include supplementary characterization salivary biomarkers include SDS-PAGE analysis , two-dimensional analytical gel , mass spectrometry identification database search . Statistics Numerical variable present mean standard deviation , categorize variable present frequency percentage . A Pearson 's correlation coefficient method use . Differences variable subject univariate analysis t-test ANOVA . The statistical processing establish SPSS 21.0 . Statistical level significance choose P &lt; 0.05 . To examine factor associate OHIP-14 total score multivariate model conceptual hierarchical multiple regression model adopt within uni-variate data7 . This well-established approach employ sequential adjustment distal proximal determinant health condition , aim elucidate relationship . Conceptual analysis , contrary statistical decision significant determinant disease , adopts theoretical order . The order variable conceptually determine accordance hypothesis assume variable confound effect , variable modification effect .</detailed_description>
