	<brief_title>A Phase I , First Man Study Evaluate Safety Tolerability panRAF Inhibitor ( CCT3833/BAL3833 ) Patients With Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic malignant melanoma 5th common cancer UK , notable proportion young patient . The development immunotherapy ( Ipilimumab ) , target therapy ( Vemurafenib , BRAF inhibitor ) result improved survival outcome patient still measure month year . These targeted therapy also useful patient relevant genetic mutation , leave significant proportion patient without targeted therapy option . The need effective ( ideally curative ) melanoma treatment remain . The Institute Cancer Research , fund Wellcome Trust , create developed new panel inhibitor aim effectively terminate growth , spread survival signal sustain cancer . The broad target allow patient possess range genetic mutation potentially benefit targeted therapy . It hop drug could use primary therapy treatmentnaive patient well rescue therapy progress targeted therapy . This phase 1 study evaluate safety effectiveness one new compound , CCT 3833 , define maximum tolerated dose patient advance melanoma . The study also aim examine way CCT3833 work within body . Once maximum tolerate dose establish small number melanoma patient , specific mutation different treatment option stage , treat gain additional safety information initial indication possible efficacy CCT3833 melanoma tumour .</detailed_description>
