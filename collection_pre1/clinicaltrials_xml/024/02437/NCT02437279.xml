	<brief_title>Study Identify Optimal Adjuvant Combination Scheme Ipilimumab Nivolumab Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients stage III melanoma palpable disease , naïve CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy , treat either post-surgery 12 week combination ipilimumab+nivolumab split design 6 week upfront surgery 6 week postsurgery . It two-arm Phase 1b feasibility trial consist 20 patient , 10 arm . At different timepoints tumor biopsy blood PBMCs take translational research . Also scan do specific timepoints . The study hold determine safety , feasibility , immune-activating capacity short-term combine neo-adjuvant adjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab . And determine relapse free survival ( RFS ) , late adverse event , pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics , correlation RFS change neo-antigen specific T cell response .</detailed_description>
