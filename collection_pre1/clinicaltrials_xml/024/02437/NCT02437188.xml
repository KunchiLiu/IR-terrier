	<brief_summary>A large number veteran suffer distress-based condition , anxiety depression , put high risk experience persistent pain prolong opioid use follow surgery . These connection base strong consistent evidence literature preliminary data . The propose study add 1-day workshop Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , follow individual `` booster '' session , treatment usual ( TAU ) reduce veteran ' risk persistent pain prolong opioid use follow surgery . ACT show effective reduce chronic pain , anxiety depression . This pilot study establish feasibility preliminary efficacy incorporate ACT treatment usual ( TAU ) preoperatively target distress-based risk factor . Aim 1 establish feasibility successfully deliver ACT at-risk veteran surgery . Aim 2 test preliminary efficacy ACT length and/or amount pain opioid use surgery . Veterans anxious depress surgery randomly assign receive ACT plus TAU TAU . Outcomes two group compare . Aim 3 see PROMIS module , develop National Institute Health , useful assess pain symptom veteran . Findings study use inform design implementation large , well control , randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy ACT plus TAU at-risk veteran . This study take place Iowa City VA Health Care System ( VAMC ) . Veterans schedule orthopedic open abdominal surgery 1 3 month score high anxiety depression randomly assign attend 1-day ACT workshop preoperatively , individualize `` booster '' session postoperatively , TAU . Veterans receive ACT trainer provide treatment interview identify barrier facilitator provide ACT at-risk veteran surgery . Other primarily outcomes pain opioid use surgery . Factors may affect outcome also measure , include anxiety , depression , substance use disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , use pain med .

	<brief_title>Preventing Persistent Post-Surgical Pain Opioid Use In At-Risk Veterans : Effect ACT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number veteran suffer distress-based condition , anxiety depression , put risk experience persistent pain prolong opioid use follow surgery . Preventing problem ( long term goal ) thousand veteran undergo surgery year dramatic impact quality life productivity , include positive effect mood , daily activity , sleep , cognitive function , social life decrease risk suicide ( 1 , 2 ) . In addition benefit individual veteran , prevention problem significantly reduce estimate billion dollar associated veteran ' utilization healthcare system well cost associate lost work productivity , include unemployment disability benefit ( 3 ) . Building strong consistent evidence show high anxiety depression put veteran risk persistent pain prolong opioid use follow surgery ( 4 , 5 ) , proposal test feasibility preliminary efficacy implement 1-day training session Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) veteran identify at-risk prior surgery . ACT show significantly low distress disability patient chronic pain ( 6-8 ) particularly valuable intervention 80 % veteran experience level psychological distress prior surgery ( 9 ) 50 % veteran report experience pain regular basis ( 10 , 11 ) . Current practice include psychological intervention specifically aim address distress-based condition prior surgery . This study necessary first step evaluate efficacy novel intervention critical juncture care benefit veteran prevent devastate consequence persistent pain prolong opioid use follow surgery . This project base interdisciplinary team 's research psychological factor predict persistent pain total knee replacement ( 12 ) effect ACT depression pain depress migraine sufferer ( 13 ) . The design 1-day workshop develop base feedback give patient receive ACT co-I Dindo 's preliminary study . The rationale research , determine feasibility preliminary efficacy incorporate 1-day workshop treatment usual ( TAU ) preoperatively target distress-based risk condition , finding study use inform design implementation large , well control , randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy ACT plus TAU ( ACT + TAU ) at-risk veteran . The follow specific aim achieve : - Aim # 1 : The primary aim pilot study determine feasibility successfully deliver 1-day ACT intervention at-risk veteran prior surgery individualize `` booster '' session surgery . The following aspect intervention assess : 1 ) number at-risk veteran willing able receive ACT workshops individual `` booster '' session ; 2 ) veteran identification barrier facilitator receive ACT intervention utilize skill teach ; 3 ) trainer identification barrier facilitator provide ACT intervention at-risk veteran surgery ; 4 ) veteran trainer suggestion way improve intervention . These aspect assess primarily guide open-ended interview ACT workshop 3 month postoperatively . - Aim # 2 : To determine 1-day preoperative ACT workshop individualize `` booster '' session postoperatively reduce length and/or amount pain opioid use follow surgery compare treatment usual ( TAU ) . Participants randomize ACT + TAU TAU record pain opioid use daily surgery . - Aim # 3 : A secondary , exploratory aim determine usability utility Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) modules assess pain associate symptom veteran . We compare module Brief Pain Inventory ( Pain Interference ) , State/Trait Anxiety Inventory ( Anxiety ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ ) -9 ( Depression ) . This project potential infuse know effective treatment chronic pain acute care environment benefit veteran improve surgical outcome . It incorporate interdisciplinary approach care veteran attend psychology pain .</detailed_description>
