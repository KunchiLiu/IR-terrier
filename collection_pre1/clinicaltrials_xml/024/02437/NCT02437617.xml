	<brief_summary>The goal research study collect test tumor tissue patient advance cancer may enrol Phase 1 study treatment . Researchers study result genetic test help researcher determine therapy may prove beneficial patient future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic Profiling Assay Phase I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , tumor tissue collect previously surgery prior biopsy ( archived tissue ) use genetic testing . Genetic test look whether specific gene change ( mutate ) tumor . The result genetic test document medical record . Your doctor may use result genetic test help decide treatment . While await result genomic profile assay , may enrol another treatment either MD Anderson near home . This decide treat physician . Your sample give code number send genetic test Foundation Medicine . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge send tissue test access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Foundation Medicine able link data . Researchers also review medical history follow collection tissue , learn use genetic test effect outcome treatment . This investigational study . Up 300 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients advanced cancer . 2 . Consent use archival tissue primary metastatic cancer diagnosis . Note : Patients may currently enrol investigational protocol include treatment protocol . 3 . Control Group # 2 : Control Group # 2 consist 100 patient MDACC/Phase I historical archive . Patients ( case older 2 year ) select base clinical characteristic genomic alteration similar match targeted therapy group . 4 . Patients may receive prior 'matched ' therapy ; however , time enrollment , patient may currently know 'matched ' therapy , may receive 'matched ' therapy last treatment receive treatment time consent . 5 . Patients life expectancy great 3 month . 1 . Patients advance cancer NOT likely meet additional enrollment criterion match targeted therapy protocols treatment . 2 . Patients archival tissue available . 3 . Patients exclude last treatment enrollment include targeted agent match genomic alteration patient 's tumor .</criteria>
