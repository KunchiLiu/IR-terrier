	<brief_summary>Infections blood extremely serious require intravenous antibiotic treatment . When infection result antibiotic resistant bacteria , choice antibiotic extremely important decision . Some type bacteria produce enzyme may inactivate essential antibiotic , related penicillin , call 'beta-lactams ' . Furthermore high level production enzymes occur therapy lead clinical failure , even antibiotic appear effective laboratory test . However , risk occur clinical practice well described limited range antibiotic class type bacteria call Enterobacter . There currently uncertainty whether commonly use , highly effective antibiotic , call piperacillin-tazobactam subject risk resistance develop treatment . Infections cause Enterobacter ( bacteria similar resistance mechanism ) often treated alternative drug call meropenem ( carbapenem antibiotic ) , effective extremely broad-spectrum activity . Excessive use carbapenems drive resistance antibiotic class - represent 'lastline ' antibiotic defence . As , need study help u see whether alternative meropenem effective safe choice . No study ever directly test whether two antibiotic effectiveness type infection . The purpose study randomly assign patient blood infection cause Enterobacter related bacteria either meropenem piperacillin/tazobactam order test whether antibiotic similar effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Meropenem Versus Piperacillin-Tazobactam Mortality Clinial Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotic resistance problem immense public health significance . Effective antibiotic essential complex therapeutic intervention transplant medicine , critical care major surgery . It estimate least 2 million people acquire infection bacteria resistant standard therapy year United States , least 23,000 death directly attributable infection . With new antibacterial agent late-stage development , necessary consider use exist generic agent target approach . This might include revisit therapeutic option previously consider inferior . Bloodstream infection cause Gram negative bacteria commonly encounter clinical practice associate high rate mortality . Outcomes may dependent upon timely administration appropriate antibiotic , especially septic shock . Bacteria posse resistance mechanism commonly employ antibiotic therefore great concern may contribute mortality . Over last 25 year , two antibiotic choice predominate intravenous management infection . These combination beta-lactam antibiotic beta-lactamase inhibitor ( piperacillin/tazobactam ) third generation cephalosporin , ceftriaxone . However , commonly encounter Gram negative organism possess chromosomally encode beta-lactamase enzyme , know AmpC beta-lactamase , may hydrolyse 3rd generation cephalosporin . Expression AmpC may inducible follow beta-lactam exposure Enterobacteriaceae loss inhibitory effect regulatory element control gene transcription . Furthermore , inducible gene-expression become constitutively 'de-repressed ' mutational loss regulatory ampD ampR gene , lead high-levels AmpC production phenotype demonstrate vitro resistance beta-lactams beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor ( BLBLI ) combination agent , except cefepime carbapenems . Such variant usually present low level ( e.g . 10-5 10-7 total bacterial population ) may rapidly select antibiotic therapy . As result , AmpC-producing bacteria present particular problem antibiotic susceptibility reporting treatment . In vitro susceptibility may correlate clinical efficacy resistance beta-lactam antibiotic emerge selection variant express high level AmpC . This best described context Enterobacter bacteraemia therapy 3rd generation cephalosporin ( 3GCs ) . In landmark study Chow et al . 1991 , 129 patient Enterobacter bacteraemia prospectively examine . Prior cephalosporin use predict great likelihood identify multi-drug resistant isolate initial blood culture , associate high subsequent mortality . Furthermore , emergence resistance cephalosporin develop treatment 6 ( 19 % ) 31 bacteraemic episode treat cephalosporin . It worth note phenomenon see small number patient treat piperacillin study , many Enterobacter isolates would report non-susceptible 3GCs accord current breakpoints . Several Gram-negative bacteria contain inducible beta-lactamase gene capacity de-repression . They informally label 'ESCPM ' group , variably describe comprise Enterobacter spp . ( especially E. cloaca E. aerogenes ) , Serratia marcescens , Citrobacter freundii , Providencia spp . Morganella morganii . Clinical study show variable risk emergent resistance clinical failure occur beta-lactam therapy , particularly 3GCs , occurs associate high mortality healthcare-related cost . As result , 3GCs usually recommended therapy AmpC-producers , even susceptible vitro . Although clinical study directly address question , carbapenems often consider optimal therapy serious infection cause AmpC producer Enterobacter , Serratia Citrobacter spp . Yet widespread use carbapenems may cause selection pressure lead carbapenem-resistant organism , thus limit therapeutic option `` last-line '' antibiotic colistin tigecycline . There therefore need establish efficacy generically available alternative carbapenems serious infection cause bacteria AmpC-mediated resistance mechanism . Infections cause ESCPM organism may also treat agent quinolones , aminoglycosides , trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole cefepime , susceptibility proven . However , limitation term toxicity ( aminoglycosides ) , limited contemporaneous efficacy data well adverse effect profile ( trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole ) selective pressure multi-resistant organism C. difficile ( quinolones ) . A controversial meta-analysis cast doubt safety efficacy cefepime , although significance finding debate . Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor ( BLBLI ) combination agent , piperacillin/tazobactam , uncertain role context , frequently avoid concern relate development AmpC-mediated resistance . However , piperacillin-tazobactam , unlike clavulanate-containing BLBLIs , show degree synergy AmpC de-repressed isolates . In vitro animal model , piperacillin-tazobactam appear less able cephalosporin select resistant Enterobacter mutant . Tazobactam also less potent inducer AmpC expression clavulanate . Furthermore , different 'ESCPM ' specie display variable degree AmpC production ; instance , de-repressed Serratia , Providencia Morganella strain express level AmpC approximately 10-fold de-repressed Enterobacter Citrobacter . It also worth note piperacillin-tazobactam retains activity M. morganii even express high level AmpC enzyme . It may therefore mislead consider 'ESCPM ' organism homogenous group regard . The risk therapeutic failure use BLBLIs ESCPM organism test susceptible little study directly prospective clinical study . Retrospective study would suggest risk may relatively low even associate improved outcome . In study examine 477 patient Enterobacter bacteraemia , risk emergent AmpC-mediated resistance broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy 19 % - concordance original finding Chow et al - remain significant risk factor multivariate analysis ( RR = 2.3 ; 95 % CI 1.2-4.3 ) . However , association emergent resistance use piperacillin-tazobactam ( RR 1.1 ; 95 % CI 0.4-2.7 ) BLBLI combination , although agent frequently use . A late study analyse 377 consecutive episode Enterobacter bacteraemia , factor independently associate reduction 30 day mortality empirical use piperacillin-tazobactam ( OR 0.11 ; 95 % CI 0.01-0.99 ) , although 13.1 % 35.4 % patient receive agent empirical definitive therapy respectively . The concept BLBLIs universally avoid infection cause AmpC producer , even susceptibility proven , question . There great variation clinical practice laboratory report across Australia world regard . Demonstrating , well-designed clinical trial , use piperacillin-tazobactam serious infection cause ESCPM organism non-inferior establish option carbapenems would prove invaluable antimicrobial stewardship program aim restrict carbapenem quinolone use . We still relatively clinical study help guide therapeutic decision infection cause AmpC-producers , randomised-controlled trial specifically examine question . Bloodstream infection cause bacteria relatively common drive use broad-spectrum antibiotic use . Given alarm emergence bacterial resistance 'last-line ' antibiotic carbapenems , urgently require well design study guide therapeutic decision area . Both meropenem piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotic widely use clinical practice many year . They prove efficacy wide range infectious syndrome , include severe sepsis , febrile neutropenia , ventilator-associated pneumonia intra-abdominal sepsis . Both agent licence treatment serious infection available routine clinical use generic form .</detailed_description>
