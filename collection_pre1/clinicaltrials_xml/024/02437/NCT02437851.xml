	<brief_title>Surgery Treating Patients With Early Stage Anal Canal Perianal Cancer HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define proportion participant develop treatment failure 2 year , define occurrence distant nodal metastases recurrence cancer require chemotherapy ( CMT ) , define cancer longer meet definition superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma ( SISCCA ) cancer excise clear margin preservation sphincter function , develop SISCCA recurrence elect undergo CMT rather repeat excision patient originally treat excision anal canal perianal SISCCA . II . To define 1-year proportion participant develop incident anal squamous cancer sit location index SISCCA patient treat excision anal canal perianal SISCCA . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define proportion participant develop treatment failure 3 year , define occurrence distant nodal metastases recurrence cancer require CMT , define cancer longer meet definition SISCCA cancer excise clear margin preservation sphincter function develop SISCCA recurrence elect undergo CMT rather repeat excision patient treat excision anal canal perianal SISCCA . II . To determine morbidity associate local excision SISCCA , include non-healing ulcer , fissure , persistent pain bleeding , stricture , incontinence , colostomy 6 month excision SISCCA . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type cancer compare overlie high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) HSIL biopsy collect concurrently progress cancer . II . To determine compare HPV integration site anal cancer well HSIL overlie contiguous cancer HSIL biopsy collect concurrently progress cancer . III . Perform gene expression array analysis compare expression anal cancer HSIL overlie contiguous cancer . IV . Perform gene expression array analysis compare expression HSIL biopsy progress cancer non-progressing HSIL biopsy location . V. Characterize genetic change anal cancer compare HSIL overlie contiguous cancer . VI . Characterize genetic change HSIL biopsy progress cancer compare non-progressing HSIL biopsy location . VII . Perform gene expression array analysis characterize genetic change SISCCAs cure wide local excision comparison SISCCAs progress wide local excision . OUTLINE : Patients undergo surgery remove anal perianal cancer . Any HSIL remain treated goal complete eradication accordance clinician participant preference . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 36 month .</detailed_description>
