	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II trial combination pegylated IFN-alpha 2b ixazomib metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) . Researchers believe disable protein complex NF-kB , control transfer genetic information ; use study drug Ixazomib , promote necrotic cell death RCC use interferon alpha - 2b . They hypothesize combination ixazomib IFN lead increase necrotic cell death RCC tumor consequent clinical benefit patient . Patients receive ixazomib capsule pegylated IFN alfa 2b injection research study . Treatments give weekly 4 week treatment make one cycle .</brief_summary>
