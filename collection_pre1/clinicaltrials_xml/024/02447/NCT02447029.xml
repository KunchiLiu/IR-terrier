	<brief_title>Self-Administered Lidocaine Gel Pain Management With First Trimester Surgical Abortion : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abortion remain one common surgical procedure world , regardless region development status [ Guttmacher 2012 ] . In United States , least half woman experience unintended pregnancy age 45 , one third woman abortion age [ Guttmacher 2014 ] . Despite universal effort increase comfort procedure , pain remain limit factor abortion perform . Recent estimate reveal 70-97 % woman experience pain abortion [ Renner 2010 , Paul 2009 , Belanger 1988 ] . Strategies reduce aspect abortion relate pain potential significant public health impact , give large number woman seek service . A survey National Abortion Federation clinic find date , provider ( 84 % ) employ use lidocaine paracervical block cervical anesthesia prior abortion [ O'Connell 2009 ] , traditionally without wait period lidocaine administration procedure initiation . To best knowledge , publish study 1 ) rigorously examine effect time interval local anesthetic administration procedure initiation , 2 ) explore whether adequate pain relief possible self-administered , non-invasive mean alone . The investigator propose explore effect locally apply lidocaine gel place traditional paracervical block decrease abortion relate pain . The objective study compare pain control various time point first trimester surgical abortion use locally apply , patient-administered lidocaine gel compare traditional lidocaine paracervical block . If patient-administered vaginal gel acceptable effective , would increase option pain control abortion gynecologic procedure , perhaps replace paracervical injection altogether . Hypothesis : Patients receive lidocaine gel apply 30 minute prior first trim surgical abortion pain control equivalent traditional paracervical block . This non-inferiority , open-label , randomize control trial woman age 18 older undergo first trimester surgical abortion 50/7 116/7 week .</detailed_description>
