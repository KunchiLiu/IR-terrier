	<brief_summary>Background : platelet concentrate could enhance growth factor ( GF ) crevicular fluid level might crucial proper tissue repair wound heal . However , open usually contaminate nature periodontal defect could affect negatively GF availability activity . To test assumption , study design evaluate level VEGF PDGF-BB gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) early stage heal localized intrabony defect treat platelet rich growth factor ( PRGF ) platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) compare xenograft defect fill control . Methods : Thirty non-smoking patient severe chronic periodontitis participate prospective , randomized single blind trial . Each patient contribute one interproximal defect randomly assign bone substitute graft control ( n=10 ) G1 , experimental PRGF ( n=10 ) G2 PRF ( n=10 ) G3 . Plaque index , gingival index , probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) intrabony depth defect ( IBD ) measure baseline patient enrollment . Gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) sample collect day 1 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 30 day therapy . The primary outcome variable change VEGF PDGF-BB level site treat PRGF PRF compare xenograft treat case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Owing lot challenge face use recombinant growth factor periodontal therapy , important look alternative combine ease preparation physiologic mode delivery . Platelet concentrate develop purpose many debate duration GF availability defect area . Platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) leucocyte- platelet-rich fibrin biomaterial . This dense fibrin membrane claim release high quantity three main growth factor ( Transforming Growth Factor b-1 ( TGFβ-1 ) , platelet derive growth factor AB , PDGF-AB ; vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF ) important coagulation matricellular glycoprotein ( thrombospondin-1 , TSP-1 ) . It natural fibrin framework protect growth factor proteolysis . It show PRF release growth factor gradually keep activity relatively long period compare platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) . Levels release TGF-1 PDGF-AB markedly increase reach high amount day , decrease mildly . In contrast , PRP experience uncontrollable short-term release TGF-1 PDGF-AB , reach high amount day 1 decrease rapidly.Clinically , find PRF improve clinical parameter associate human intrabony periodontal defect BPBM ( bovine porous bone mineral ) ability augment effect PRF reduce pocket depth , improve clinical attachment level , promote defect fill . On hand study report similar PD ( probe depth ) reduction , CAL ( clinical attachment level ) gain , bone fill sit treat PRF PRP compare conventional open flap debridement . Preparation rich growth factor ( PRGF-Endoret ) technology claim circumvent many limitation report platelet-rich preparation . Sodium citrate calcium chloride use anticoagulant clot activator , respectively . Addition calcium chloride promote formation native thrombin , mimic physiological clotting process enable sustained release growth factor , might crucial proper tissue repair wound heal . Moreover , procedure obviate immunological reaction risk disease transmission associate use exogenous bovine thrombin . Anitua et al report PRGF contains moderately elevate platelet concentration ~6x105 platelet , report induce optimal biological benefit . Lower platelet concentration lead suboptimal effect , whereas high concentration might inhibitory effect . PRGF application extraction improve healing process diabetic patient accelerate socket closure ( epithelialization ) tissue maturation , prove association PRGF use improve wound heal diabetic patient . In present study propose open , constantly contaminate nature periodontal defect could source continuous catabolic bacterial tissue enzyme bind protein affect platelet concentrate contain GF availability activity . To confirm assumption , study design evaluate level platelet derive growth factor - BB ( PDGF-BB ) vascular endothelial cell growth factor ( VEGF ) GCF early stage heal site treat PRF PRGF intrabony periodontal defect correlate GF level clinical finding . This could figure potential 2 commonly used platelet concentrate periodontal defect ecology .</detailed_description>
