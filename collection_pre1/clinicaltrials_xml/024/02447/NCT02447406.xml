	<brief_summary>Phase Ib/II , single-arm study AZD6094 ( Volitinib ) combination docetaxel , advance gastric adenocarcinoma patient MET amplification second-line treatment . Phase Ib : Investigational product , dosage mode administration Volitinib orally available , potent , selective , small molecule c-MET inhibitor . Volitinib administer least 200mg orally day 21 day achieve appropriate antitumor activity . Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 administer via intravenous access every 3 week Phase II : Investigational product , dosage mode administration Volitinib orally available , potent , selective , small molecule c-MET inhibitor . Subjects receive Volitinib daily ( MTD determine Phase Ib ) 21 day one cycle . Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 administer via intravenous access every 3 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib , Single-arm Study AZD6094 ( Volitinib ) Combination With Docetaxel , Any Solid Cancer Sequential Phase II , Single-arm Study AZD6094 ( Volitinib ) Combination With Docetaxel Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients With MET Amplification Second Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volitinib potent selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor . Volitinib find inhibit c-Met kinase enzyme cell level IC50s 4 nM enzyme Met phosphorylation cell . Consistent potent enzyme cell activity , volitinib find inhibit cell growth vitro tumor c-Met gene amplification absence HGF stimulation IC50s generally 10 nM . It also potently inhibit HGF-stimulated cell proliferation tumor c-Met overexpression carry HGF/c-Met autocrine loop . In xenograft model Hs746T c-Met gene amplification , suboptimal dos 0.6 mg/kg volitinib 3 mg/kg docetaxel induce TGI ( expand ) 55.8 % 80.8 % , respectively , whereas combination result TGI 101.1 % , statistical significance see combination group either mono-therapy group . Plasma exposures volitinib docetaxel determine last dose end study , significant difference combination single agent exposure either volitinib docetaxel . More importantly , combination well tolerant body weight loss find animal . These result suggest would worthwhile study combination use volitinib docetaxel clinic .</detailed_description>
