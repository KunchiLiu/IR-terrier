	<brief_title>Proportional Assist Ventilation Minimizing Duration Mechanical Ventilation : The PROMIZING Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation help breathe recover acute illness . Although mechanical ventilation necessary sustain life situation , induce weakness respiratory muscle may lead prolonged dependence ventilator . Prolonged dependence mechanical ventilation associate increased mortality , morbidity cost healthcare system . Thus , main goal assist mechanical ventilation reduce patient 's respiratory distress maintain respiratory muscle activity . To attain goal , amount ventilator assistance theoretically adjust target normal reasonable level respiratory effort . Modes Mechanical Ventilation : Proportional assist ventilation load-adjustable gain factor ( PAV+ ) mode mechanical ventilation delivers assistance breathe proportion patient 's effort . The proportional assistance , call gain , adjust clinician maintain patient 's respiratory effort workload within reasonable range . This mode ventilation allow measurement target specific range respiratory muscle activity patient . Pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) mode ventilation consider current standard care assist breathe patient recovery phase acute respiratory failure . Several study show short term advantage PAV PSV , include improve patient-ventilator synchronization , improve adaptability change patient effort , improve sleep quality . Goal Randomized Controlled Trial : To demonstrate patient acute respiratory failure , ventilation PAV+ , physiological , result short duration time spent mechanical ventilation ventilation PSV .</detailed_description>
