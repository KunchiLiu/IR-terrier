	<brief_summary>Study 201283 exploratory , non-controlled , non-drug study Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) subject . This study conduct first step develop new meaningful measure ( ) might prove effective exist measure monitor clinical function disease course ALS . The objective study test novel measure movement/physical activity , heart rate speech explore measure disease progression evaluate relationship gold standard measure function . This study conduct two phase . A variable length Pilot Phase test biotelemetry instrument algorithms reliability ease use/acceptance . Approximately 5 subject least 1 clinic visit perform series set reference task wear accelerometer electrode . Subjects also continuously wear accelerometer electrode routine home-life set approximately 3 day clinic visit ( i.e. , home monitoring ) . Subjects Pilot Phase continue study participate Core Study Phase . A 48 week Core Study Phase conduct evaluate measure movement/physical activity , speech Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) relate ALS disease progression . During phase , maximum 25 subject enrol . Subjects attend 5 clinic visit perform gold standard measure function perform series set reference task wear accelerometer electrode . In clinic visit , every month subject attach accelerometer electrode wear approximately 3 day home . A telephone contact subject make site end 3-day home monitoring period .

	<criteria>Between 18 80 year age , inclusive , time signing informed consent . Diagnosed ALS neurologist expertise ALS . For subject bulbar onset must objective limb involvement least one limb . Diagnosed ALS within 18 month symptom onset . Subjects must ambulatory ( i.e. , must confine wheelchair ) . Male female subject . Capable give sign ( verbal consent assent applicable ) inform consent describe Protocol include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Capable willing comply requirement protocol ( either assistance ) . Neurological ( subject 's ALS ) nonneurological comorbidities ( e.g . joint disease , respiratory disease ) limit mobility . Clinically significant cognitive impairment opinion investigator . Regionally restricted form ALS , atypical variant : Isolated corticobulbar pattern ALS normal ambulation ; Flail arm syndrome ; Primary lateral sclerosis ; Signs chronic partial denervation restrict single limb ; ALS parkinsonism dementia complex Subjects require mechanical ventilation ( noninvasive ventilation sleep apnoea allow ) . Historical current evidence clinically significant uncontrolled disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation impact study assessment endpoint . Presence active implantable cardiac medical device ( e.g. , pacemaker implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ) high risk need external defibrillation . History skin hypersensitivity adhesive . Current participation clinical trial opinion investigator GSK medical monitor might impact objective study .</criteria>
