In order know , investigator use `` fluid challenge '' administration `` small amount '' fluid short period time order test cardiovascular response dose fluid . However , unclear `` small '' amount . The aim study find minimum volume require perform effective `` fluid challenge '' . The investigator hypothesize change mean pressure cardiovascular system ( socalled mean systemic filling pressure Pmsf ) administration small amount fluid use detect minimum volume require effectively test cardiovascular system fluid challenge . On hand , microcirculation may remain impaired despite stabilization macrocirculation . The microcirculation much dynamic macrocriculation , essential observe change time . Patients admit investigator ' intensive care unit ( ICU ) due sepsis include study . The sample divide 4 group accord volume fluid challenge : 2 ml/kg , 3 ml/kg , 4ml/Kg 5 ml/kg . The investigator measure Pmsf non-invasively use pneumatic tourniquet inflate one minute . Invasive arterial blood pressure observe inflation cuff arm determine Pmsf . The least significant change Pmsf use method 14 % . The minimal volume one achieve change Pmsf .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE AND DESIGN The main objective study find minimum volume fluid require perform effective `` fluid challenge '' septic patient . An effective fluid challenge would one able increase mean pressure cardiovascular system blood circulation socalled mean systemic filling pressure ( Pmsf ) . It similar pressure pneumatic tyre , related volume air elastic property tyre wall . In order , investigator observe change mean systemic filling pressure small amount fluids investigator able realise much volume require increase pressure . To assure change Pmsf real change , investigator conduct pilot study order determine precision Pmsf measurement use Pmsf-arm technique . The least significant change 14 % baseline measurement . The Pmsf-arm technique process similar investigator use measure non-invasive blood pressure . The investigator measure arterial-venous equilibrium pressure arm rapid brief interruption blood circulation . In order , totally noninvasive automatic tourniquet attach arm arterial line insert tourniquet inflate 60 second . This process do baseline fluid challenge . The second objective observe microcirculation affective fluid challenge correlate change observe change cardiac function Pmsf . The third objective observe change generate vasoactive therapy macro microcirculation accord cardiac response type vasoactive therapy use . In investigator ' clinical practice , investigator observe case infusion 250 ml fluid impact cardiovascular function . The investigator believe case investigator may give enough fluid increase Pmsf test cardiovascular response . RECRUITMENT The sample recruit convenience . It important understand difference fluid resuscitation fluid challenge . The fluid resuscitation require normally large amount volume medical emergency order achieve cardiovascular stability . Once patient minimally stable , fluid challenge normally carry order find patient may benefit fluid . As performance fluid challenge part normal clinical practice patient admit ICU , minimal extra risk participation study . CONSENT Informed consent require become participant study . Informed consent obtain Principal Investigator also clinical responsibility care patient care intensive care department . The PI receive train Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) . RISK , BURDENS AND BENEFITS Currently , investigator use fluid administration protocol septic patient base principle `` stroke volume maximization '' . The investigator perform fluid challenge 4 ml/kg patient become `` non-responder '' , mean heart able increase volume eject anymore . However , investigator observe pitfall protocol . Some patient classify `` non-responders '' may need 4 ml/kg test cardiovascular response . The investigator ' hypothesis case , cardiovascular system either relaxed empty , 4 ml/kg enough increase mean systemic filling pressure . Therefore , possible benefit associate study avoid possible pitfall . If fluid challenge Pmsf change significantly , clinician charge inform he/she decide whether continue subsequent fluid challenge investigator observe significant change Pmsf . There relevant risk participation study . As fluid challenge perform accordance clinician prescription , observation non-invasive involve risk participant arterial line normally use patient , minimal extra risk participate study . CONFIDENTIALITY Identifiable data obtain purpose study . All data ( case report form electronic file ) anonymised . The participant identify code generate specifically study . The `` identification code '' generate participant link `` hospital number '' name patient , secret rule keep confidentially principal researcher . This rule use case miss information complete retrospectively . The person able access identifiable information principal investigator , aware responsibility confidentiality study . All data collect store encrypted electronic memory write material custody principal investigator . No write material contain identifiable data . CONFLICT OF INTEREST During period study , principal investigator responsible participant 's care time , order avoid conflict interest . However , principal investigator retain clinical responsibility care patient member intensive care department . At end study , investigator plan use information chapter doctoral thesis , present study international conference , hopefully , publish result scientific journal . If patient wish inform result study , investigator send copy abstract present international conference email , copy paper accept medical journal email .</detailed_description>
