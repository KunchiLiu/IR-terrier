	<brief_summary>Hand grip strength ( GS ) non-invasive marker whole body skeletal muscle strength function use research recommend simple inexpensive measure suitable clinical use . Research show low GS hospital inpatient associate poor healthcare outcomes include increase postoperative complication , long length stay , increase functional limitation disability . Measuring GS admission hospital potential identify people risk poor healthcare outcome allow early intervention include focus nutrition mobility . Yet , GS measurement routinely use clinical practice . The aim study evaluate implementation GS measurement routine clinical practice Medicine Older People ward UHS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Grip Strength Routine Implementation ( GRImP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This implementation research involve mixed method combine qualitative quantitative element . The first preliminary part study define current baseline practice MOP ward University Hospital Southampton ( UHS ) regard identification patient high risk poor healthcare outcome , inpatient ' nutritional care management mobility . For purpose , ethnographic approach ( involve interview , focus group , audit clinical record ) follow . Understanding healthcare system work enable justification integration GS measurement routine practice effective way . Participants situation sample purposive basis mean `` cases/participants sample strategic way best answer research question '' . Single in-depth semi structure interview conduct different group healthcare staff different level experience role include consultant , junior doctor , ward sister , dietician , physiotherapist , therapy assistant ( total 10-15 healthcare staff member ) . The investigator also conduct focus group nurse staff 5 ward , nurse similar seniority group encourage free discussion ( approximately 15-20 nurse divide 4-5 focus group ) gain understanding share practice . The medical note patient first 1-3 bed bay 5 ward examine ( approximately 54 record ) . Basic information patient : age , gender , date admission , domicile status , reason admission first extract . Then investigator check record extract information within first 2-3 day admission risk assessment measure could indicate risk factor poor healthcare outcome . In addition , number reason referral weekly last 3 month dietetic team abstract E-referral system . The number prescribed oral nutritional supplement ( ONS ) also calculate weekly last 3 month electronic prescribe system . These figure important later analysis comparison order ass change routine practice . The second part research involve develop train programme measure GS creation care plan old patient low GS level . Then , nursing , medical therapy staff 5 ward MOP department train measurement grip strength interpretation grip strength value . There approximately 150 nursing staff MOP across 5 ward , train period 3 month GS measurement group 5-10 . Additional training session provide junior doctor , consultant therapy staff take opportunity incorporate regular educational session possible . The time date training session define agreed liaise train lead MOP avoid disruption daily task MOP staff . The training session last approximately 1 hour . At end session , participant ask evaluate training session use 5-points rating scale give feedback . Nurses attend train session ask part training program measure GS colleague accord standard protocol assessment competency measure GS patient . Implementation GS start soon complete first training session ward . GS measure patient admit MOP ward within 1-3 day admission ward nurse . Only patient unable squeeze dynamometer handle patient arthritis ill exclude . Grip strength measure ward nurse use Jamar dynamometer ask patient squeeze hand twice , start right hand use standardise protocol . A brief break approximately 1 minute allow squeeze . The maximum GS measurement record . A total 5 Jamar dynamometer available study , one ward . The maximum GS value cod two category : score 1 represent value less 27 kg men le 16 kg woman refers patient high risk poor health outcome , score 2 represent value ≥27 kg men ≥16 kg woman represent low risk . Patients low maximum GS value ( men &lt; 27 kg woman &lt; 16 kg ) unable perform test receive care plan . The care plan focus review dietary energy protein intake need oral nutritional supplement dietetic review , review mobility need physiotherapy review regard progressive resistance exercise increase muscle strength . During implementation process , monitor evaluation outcome implementation refer World Health Organisation ( WHO ) `` implementation outcome variable '' include assess : acceptability GS measurement , adoption , coverage , fidelity , cost . Patients staff acceptability assess conduct qualitative research ( interviews focus group ) . A sample 10-15 patient 10-20 MOP staff deem enough gain understanding view experience GS measurement . Staff interview also assist understand GS routine implementation adopt initiated five ward . Random weekly visit MOP conduct check fidelity continue staff competency measure GS well audit number number proportion patient GS measure receive care plan ward . Coverage GS implementation measure calculate total number proportion patient GS measure receive care plan MOP within 6 month routine implementation .</detailed_description>
