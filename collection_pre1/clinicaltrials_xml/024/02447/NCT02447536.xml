	<brief_title>Trial Two Strains BCG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND At Bandim Health Project ( www.bandim.org ) Guinea-Bissau , observe Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccination birth associate survival benefit explain prevention tuberculosis ( TB ) , rare first year life . There mount evidence beneficial effect BCG neonatal mortality stem non-specific beneficial immune training , also term heterologous immunity . This way , BCG immunisation possibly confers enhance protection broad range severe infection pneumonia septicemia . In addition , observational study Guinea-Bissau suggest BCG-vaccinated child produce scar upon immunisation significantly well survival BCG-vaccinated child produce scar . The pattern regard PPD ( tuberculin ) skin test . While correct BCG-vaccination technique undoubtedly important scarring , several study show strain BCG might important well . Globally , BCG coverage exceed 90 % , make BCG widely use vaccine world . According UNICEF , annual demand BCG vaccine 130 million dos 2013 . Several different vaccine strain use , yet study compare different strain . However , several animal human study show genetically diverse vaccine strain induce different protective efficacy TB , risk adverse event susceptibility anti-TB drug . Recently , large observational study base Uganda show significant difference BCG strain concern response specific mycobacteria non-specific immune response . In particular , BCG-Denmark associate much high rate scarring ( 93 % ) BCG-Russia ( 52 % ) , also high rate adverse event term ulcer abscess ( 1.8 % versus 0.3 % ) . OBJECTIVE We aim compare effect two strain BCG ( BCG-Denmark , BCG-Russia ) provide birth child bear National Hospital Simão Mendes ( HNSM ) subsequent hospitalisation . Furthermore , mortality first 6 week adverse event 2 6 month age report child , BCG scar frequency ( 2 6 month ) PPD response ( 6 month ) report proportion infant . METHODS The study conduct Bandim Health Project ( BHP ) . The BHP maintain health demographic surveillance system ( HDSS ) 6 district capital Guinea-Bissau cover approximately 102,000 inhabitant . All house HDSS visit monthly pregnancy birth register . Study participant enrol National Hospital follow HDSS telephone interview well hospital record . The study individually randomise , 1:1 randomisation two strain ( BCG-Denmark , BCG-Russia ) . During two year inclusion period , expect able include least 12,000 child , i.e . 6,000 BCG strain group . Of , around 25 % reside within HDSS .</detailed_description>
