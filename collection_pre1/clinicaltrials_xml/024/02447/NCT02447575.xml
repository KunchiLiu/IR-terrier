	<brief_summary>Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) Dry Powdered Inhaler ( DPI ) two common device use deliver medicine condition asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . It well-known patient use correct technique use meter dose inhaler . This lead poor control disease . This study do investigator record patient use meter dose inhaler short teaching session . This information feed invitro system ( device ) allow researcher study effect error drug delivery . The device use Rice R3 electronic flowmeter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detecting Errors In Using Metered Dose Inhalers ( MDI ) Among Asthma And COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) Dry Powdered Inhaler ( DPI ) two common platform deliver medicine patient suffer Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , use dispense controller rescue medication . Despite well-known method manage Asthma COPD , nearly 70-90 % patient display correct technique use inhaler [ 8-14 , 15 ] . Poor management control disease due inadequate inhaler usage result rise rate hospitalization , make chronic respiratory disease among top five cause death worldwide . Through study aim record technique MDI usage among Asthma COPD patient understand error technique . The various parameter inhaler usage patient make error 1 . Tidal volume , inspiration flow rate , 3 . Inspiration flow volume , 4 . Timing actuation inhaler 5 . Breath hold . The parameter record Cognita R3 electronic flowmeter patient error MDI usage note . Using ex-vivo modelling , patient 's MDI technique record used study impact error technique efficiency MDI drug delivery .</detailed_description>
