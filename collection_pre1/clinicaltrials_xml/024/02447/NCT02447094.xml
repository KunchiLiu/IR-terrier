	<brief_title>Quality Life After Stroke Using Telemedicine-based Stroke Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 750,000 patient suffer ischemic stroke ( AIS ) annually United States . AIS lead cause long-term disability third-leading cause mortality . Effective therapy exist ameliorate disability associate AIS , implementation therapy time-sensitive . Currently , shortage health care professional expertise treatment stroke expertise tend concentrated large community-based academic medical center . To respond shortage , stroke network organize `` hub-and-spoke '' model facilitate rapid delivery time-sensitive intervention intravenous ( i.v . ) tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) rapid evaluation AIS . Some network also use telemedicine facilitate approach bring need expertise via robotic tele-presence ( RTP ) . Though accuracy stroke diagnosis i.v . tPA utilization may higher RTP base network , impact model patient 's outcome difficult elucidate . To end , meaningful validate outcome assessment crucial understand impact stroke intervention include telemedicine RTP base network . The objective study translate evidence-based practice healthcare , patient-centered outcome assessment , patient-family perception delivery care meaningful data . This aid validation role intervention `` hub-and-spoke '' RTP base model stroke care .</detailed_description>
