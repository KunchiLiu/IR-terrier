	<brief_title>The Effects Sound Energy Pulmonary Gas Exchange</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sound wave use various industry accelerate process mix separate fluid ( gases/liquids ) . We prove certain sound wave safely improve gas exchange lung rat accelerate gas diffusion inside airway alveoli . Now want see similar sound wave improve gas exchange human . The device create sound wave sonic pressure oscillator capable make sound wave similar loudness frequency loud human sing screaming . These wave mainly frequency range 50-500 Hz ( Hertz , oscillation per second ) intensity 85-105 dBs ( deci Bells , unit sound pressure intensity ) . We perform two bench top study witness ability sound wave augment gas diffusion . In pilot study rat show safe significant improvement pulmonary gas exchange influence sound energy . The effect sound wave gas exchange human subject , principle investigator ( PI ) , also analyze metabolic test promising result . A clinically significant improvement PI 's pulmonary gas diffusion also note DLCO ( diffuse lung capacity carbon monoxide ) test . On yet another test , artificially enlarge pulmonary dead space study , PI 's transcutaneous oxygen carbon dioxide pressure ( PtcCO2 &amp; PtcO2 ) measure result indicative presence desire safe effect particular sound wave pulmonary gas exchange . The mentioned study support rationale , objective , methodology propose study . Our human study compose primary secondary part . In primary part , sound wave introduce subject ' lung directly rather deliver open end cylinder subject breathe air close end cylinder . The sound intensity keep range 95-105dB . In second part study , sound wave low intensity ( 85-95dB ) directly introduce subject ' lung subject go 1 ) metabolic test 2 ) lung diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) test . The result test compare subject 's baseline test result ( without sound wave ) . In part study , subject ' nostril clamp ordinary plastic nose clamp ask hold mouthpiece breathe . In primary part , sound wave 95-105dB delivered 16 L ( liter ) frustum ( conical cylinder ) . The frustum 's wider base open room air small base close . A 2x20 cm tube connect close end frustum mouthpiece . The subject breathe narrower ( close ) base frustum mouthpiece 3 minute cycle follow 3 minute cycle breathe fresh room air . The subject ' PtcCO2 PtcO2 measure frustum hold various spatial orientation regard open base 1 ) vertical upward ( +90 degree horizon ) , 2 ) horizontal ( 0 degree ) , vertical downward ( -90 degree ) , tilt -45 degree angle . This test take least 6x4=24 minute , 30 minute subject . Then test do sound energy introduce frustum . Total time study subject approximately 48-60 minute . Secondary part study compose two section . In first section , diffusion capacity lungs measure sound wave played transducer deliver via mouth piece subject ' oral cavity . The sound wave travel pulmonary airway alveoli . An examiner listen chest wall make sure subject allow wave travel airway without obstruct path sound wave inadvertently hold tongue hold breath . Said mouth piece connect via Y-connector DLCO machine tube delivers sound wave . The duration exert sound effect 9 second per protocol routine DLCO testing . This period coincide time subject take deep breath hold 9 second . Lung diffusion capacity subject measure compare soundless test result . Although test use small amount carbon monoxide ( CO ) tracer gas amount consider negligible quite safe . This test do human routinely many year know discernible side effect . It approve FDA many year ago . There abundance medical literature regard safety method use DLCO . There also multiple YouTube video show DLCO do . We encourage participant watch videos study . The subject sit comfortably chair hold mouth piece mouth breathe room air . They easily interrupt test time simply take mouthpiece mouth . In second section , subject go metabolic test exhale oxygen ( O2 ) carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) measure without sound effect . Metabolic test approve FDA many year generally consider safe . During test , participant breathe mouth piece nostril clamp . Breathing gas provide connect mouth piece tube usually base flow room air 40L/min . In order show oxygenation improvement via sound energy create suboptimal respiratory environment artificially induce hypoxia . Mild hypoxia generally well tolerate healthy human although might make individual feel short breath tachypneic . We add nitrogen supply air bring fraction inhale oxygen ( FiO2 ) 17.5 % correlate breathe altitude 7500 foot ( approximately 2250m ) , similar ski resort , except n't ask subject get involve vigorous exercise like skiing , test ~20 minute . The lowered FiO2 bring subject ' pulse ox ( SpO2 ) 92-94 % generally consider safe well tolerate normal human subject cardiopulmonary condition . The resultant mild transient respiratory alkalosis clinical significance involve 20 minute test pH imbalance would buffer naturally without induce electrolyte abnormality . The acoustic transducer , mention briefly earlier , simple sound wave generator compose tone generator ( usually computer ) , electronic amplifier , acoustic transducer similar ordinary loudspeaker , funnel tube system direct sound wave subject ' mouthpiece . Its function similar stand front loudspeaker let sound penetrate mouth/nose pulmonary airway except order protect ears intensify sound funnel use capture wave direct oral cavity via tube . The device make , tune , calibrate principal investigator . It produce tone 20 Hz 11 KHz useful intensity range 65dB maximum 110dB . The simple device successfully use rat human ( PI ) without discernible side effect . For detailed description methodology result previous study please refer attached document reference literature . Data Collection : During first part study , data subject ' PtcCO2 , PtcO2 , heart rate , respiratory rate , minute volume , blood pressure log onto spread sheet save password protect computer . Lung diffusion capacity variation influence sound vibration measure record use DLCO machine respiratory department LLUMC . Data also save password protect computer use encrypted MS-Excel addition memory DLCO machine . During metabolic test , inhale exhaled concentration O2 CO2 continuously monitor along subject ' heart rate , breath rate , pulse oxymetry , blood pressure , general comfort level subject his/her clinical well . The encrypted password protect data collect Microsoft Spreadsheets statistical analysis biostatistician . RISK AND INJURY : Human ear particularly prone damage loud sound . Ear pain discomfort happen sound level low 110dB painful sound level generally consider range 125-135dB . Other organ tolerate sound wave much good tissue damage normally occur sound intensity level less 160-170dB . Sound intensity monitor recorded study . The intensity always keep 105dB significantly harmful level consider fact sound pressure level measure logarithmic scale . During metabolic test , subject pulse oximetry keep 92 % avoid ill effect . These level well tolerate human ordinarily physicians supplement oxygen patient level . Very brief hypoxia hypercapnia happen frustum test frustum hold hold +90 degree position SpO2 plummet upper 70 low 90 3 minute limit test . We halt test 3 min landmark subject 's SpO2 go 80 % . The brief transient hypoxia hypercapnia well tolerate . A medical doctor present time whenever test run . A thorough medical exam immediately test secure safety subject well . Metabolic study DLCO test do routinely many years/decades generally consider safe . The amount inhale carbon monoxide use tracer gas DLCO significantly toxic level . These test approve FDA long time consider safe even patient pulmonary disorder . BENEFITS : The study direct immediate benefit subject participate study . It anticipate sound wave may help decrease incidence severity `` ventilation induce lung injury VILI '' extent yet measure . The main reason behind postulation addition proper sound wave breathe gas enable u effectively ventilate lung low FiO2 and/or less mean airway pressure ( Pmaw ) compare currently available technology . It known long time high FiO2/Pmaw two major predictor VILI . It also anticipate outcome cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) many acute chronic pulmonary disorder COPD , asthma , cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , restrictive lung disorder , acute lung injury , pneumothorax , RDS , condition may improve use proper sound wave .</detailed_description>
