	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop novel platform allo-SCT multiple myeloma ( MM ) idea maximize anti-myeloma effect condition minimize GvHD ( graft versus host disease ) . Specifically , investigator use Flu/Mel ( fludarabine melphalan ) regimen . For GvHD prophylaxis , investigator use Hopkins PT-Cy ( post-transplant cyclophosphamide ) platform novelty add tocilizumab anti-myeloma therapy method reduce GvHD . IL-6 important role promote growth myeloma cell progression disease .</brief_summary>
