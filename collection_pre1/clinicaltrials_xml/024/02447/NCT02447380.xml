	<brief_summary>Phase II , single-arm study AZD6094 ( Volitinib ) combination docetaxel , advance gastric adenocarcinoma patient MET overexpression second-line treatment . Volitinib orally available , potent , selective , small molecule c-MET inhibitor . Subjects receive Volitinib daily ( MTD determine Phase Ib ) 21 day one cycle . Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 administer via intravenous access every 3 week . To investigate efficacy volitinib give combination docetaxel patient advance gastric adenocarcinoma harbor MET overexpression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study AZD6094 ( Volitinib ) Combination With Docetaxel , Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients With MET Overexpression Second-line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In xenograft model Hs746T c-Met gene amplification , suboptimal dos 0.6 mg/kg volitinib 3 mg/kg docetaxel induce TGI 55.8 % 80.8 % , respectively , whereas combination result TGI 101.1 % , statistical significance see combination group either mono-therapy group . Plasma exposures volitinib docetaxel determine last dose end study , significant difference combination single agent exposure either volitinib docetaxel . More importantly , combination well tolerant body weight loss find animal . These result suggest would worthwhile study combination use volitinib docetaxel clinic .</detailed_description>
