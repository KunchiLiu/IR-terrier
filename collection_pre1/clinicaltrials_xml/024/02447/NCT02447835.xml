	<brief_summary>Within past 20 year , strike increase incidence obesity 1 ; 2 , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) 3-5 , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) schizophrenic population 6-8 . Large NIH-funded trial indicate prevalence metabolic syndrome twice three time great schizophrenic patient specific class drug term `` atypical antipsychotic '' ( AAPs ) , olanzapine example , compare match control 8 . Identification pathophysiological mechanism contribute metabolic disease schizophrenic patient AAPs hamper inability differentiate underlying disease treatment-emergent complication . In addition , despite fall within drug class , different AAPs exhibit differential association metabolic disease . Olanzapine one AAPs associate great weight gain degree metabolic impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Short Term Atypical Antipsychotic Administration Compared Placebo Hepatic Insulin Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase incidence T2DM CVD AAPs assume consequence weight gain . However , accumulate evidence weight-independent effect derive vitro rodent study suggest direct effect AAPs pancreatic B-cell liver . We recently complete first two study support NIH grant provide evidence direct effect olanzapine metabolism , independent weight gain psychiatric disease . Findings first study indicate short-term administration ( 9-days ) olanzapine compare aripiprazole , another AAP well placebo dramatically increase post-prandial insulin level healthy control subject independent weight gain ; provide evidence tissue specific effect drug human . We also find increase insulin accompany increase plasma C-peptide concentration suggest olanzapine may decrease hepatic insulin extraction . Decreases hepatic insulin extraction mediate muscarinic blockade fact , data laboratory demonstrate atropine ( muscarinic antagonist ) inhibit hepatic insulin extraction human . Blockade muscarinic receptor consistent receptor bind profile olanzapine show high receptor antagonism muscarinic receptor compare AAPs . In addition , also find significant increase glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) decrease insulin sensitivity follow olanzapine administration compare aripiprazole placebo . The propose study follow finding study design investigate mechanism contribute olanzapine-induced post-prandial hyperinsulinemia GLP-1 . The overall hypothesis study olanzapine block peripheral muscarinic receptor , lead compensatory increase vagal efferent activation contributes increase insulin secretion .</detailed_description>
