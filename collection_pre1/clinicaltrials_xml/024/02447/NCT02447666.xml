	<brief_summary>Indication Treatment pediatric subject newly diagnose advanced myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Objectives Primary Objective The primary objective ass treatment effect response rate ( MDS : either complete remission [ CR ] , partial remission [ PR ] , marrow CR ; JMML : either clinical complete remission [ cCR ] clinical partial remission [ cPR ] ) ; Cycle 3 Day 28 ( cycle 28 day ) compare standard therapy use matched-pairs analysis historical data . Secondary Objective The secondary objective evaluate safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) azacitidine subject population . Study Design This prospective , open-label , Phase 2 study consist 2 parallel experimental arm , one disease group : MDS JMML . Each arm design base Simon 's Optimal 2 stage study design . The sample size calculate allow evaluation response rate 28 day-Cycle 3 Day 28 2 disease group . Each experimental arm also individually compare historical control arm use data retrospectively collect European Working Group MDS childhood ( EWOG-MDS ) registry mean matched-pairs analysis ; match predefined subject baseline characteristic define result study know post Stage 1 . Twenty subject MDS 35 JMML subject evaluable primary endpoint ( ie , subject receive least 1 dose investigational product [ IP ] ) enrol approximately 45 center Europe . Each experimental arm 1 interim analysis plan ( end Stage 1 ) . If , Stage 1 evaluation , less 2 subject observe CR , PR , marrow CR 3 month azacitidine first 9 subject MDS , enrollment stop . Similarly , less 3 subject observe cPR cCR 3 month azacitidine first 18 subject JMML , enrollment stop .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Population Pediatric subject age 1 month less 18 year age newly diagnose condition advance myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) . Length Study The enrollment period last 22 month subject treat minimum 3 month maximum 6 month , transplantation disease progression ( base independent central review response . Once investigational product ( IP ) discontinue , subject follow 2 year last dose investigational product ( IP ) . The follow-up may terminate new anticancer treatment hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . The End Trial define either date last visit last subject complete study , date receipt last data point last subject require primary , secondary and/or exploratory analysis , pre-specified protocol and/or Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) , whichever later date .</detailed_description>
