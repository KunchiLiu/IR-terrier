	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer seventh common cancer UK , 10,399 new case diagnosed 2011 . In quarter case cancer infiltrate muscular wall bladder ( muscle invasive ) life threaten . This type bladder cancer usually treat either surgical removal bladder , daily radiotherapy treatment ( high strength xrays kill cell ) , give every day 4 7 week . RAIDER investigate method potential improve well radiotherapy work . RAIDER base study novel radiotherapy technique conduct single UK NHS Trust . Bladder radiotherapy normally deliver use single plan throughout treatment treat whole bladder radiotherapy dose . In adaptive radiotherapy delivery plan choose 3 possible plan . In cancer ( tumour ) focus radiotherapy , high dose radiotherapy aim tumour within bladder . In RAIDER , 240 participant muscle invasive bladder cancer one 3 treatment group : 1. standard whole bladder radiotherapy 2. standard dose tumour focus adaptive radiotherapy 3. dose escalate tumour boost adaptive radiotherapy Participants visit hospital 4 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month radiotherapy annually thereafter check whether cancer return receive treatment symptom may experience . RAIDER aim confirm multicentre set novel technique allow high radiotherapy dose standard reliably target tumour within bladder check long term side effect treatment acceptable . If case , result RAIDER use develop study establish whether dose escalate radiotherapy well treat bladder cancer standard dose .</brief_summary>
