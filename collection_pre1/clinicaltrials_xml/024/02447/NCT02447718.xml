	<detailed_description>Rationale Aims : Children acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) evidence persistent immunosuppression follow chemotherapy may experience wan immunity vaccine receive prior treatment . There standard care Canada regard immunologic evaluation booster immunization child ALL chemotherapy . This study aim identify predictor low baseline immunity vaccine antigens child ALL evaluate immunogenicity safety standard immunization regimen : DTaP-IPV-Hib PCV13 booster immunization administer 6 month post-chemotherapy , follow PPV23 . Study Design : This multi-center open-label clinical trial child diagnose ALL ≥1 year age , receive immunization influenza since complete chemotherapy undergo immunologic evaluation serologic test pneumococcus , tetanus , pertussis varicella . They immunize PCV13 , DTaP-IPV-Hib , regardless immunization history [ unless PPV23 receive within prior 12 month ] . Other routine vaccine require per provincial centre-specific immunization policy also administer . PPV23 administer 8 week PCV13 . Repeat serologic test conducted 2 month 12-15 month DTaP-IPV-Hib PCV13 immunization ass short long-term immune response . Adverse event follow immunization ( AEFI ) capture standardized telephone interview day 8-10 30-33 post-immunization capture local systemic AEFI .</detailed_description>
