	<brief_title>Evaluation Conditional Cash Transfers Increase Retention PMTCT Services Akwa Ibom State , Nigeria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Nigeria , home 2 % world 's population , account 30 % world 's mother-to-child transmission HIV . Over past three year , collaboration bilateral aid agency , Nigerian government strengthen hundred free rural clinic , train thousand birth attendant , begin free distribution antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug . Despite , 1.8 % low-income woman deliver baby skilled birth attendant , 16 % HIV-positive pregnant woman receive ARVs prevent mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) HIV , 2.3 % infant bear HIV-infected woman receive ARV prophylaxis reduce risk virus transmission . Pregnant woman lose step along PMTCT cascade , attend prenatal visit give life-saving antiretroviral therapy newborn . Operated New Incentives , non-profit organization focus maternal child health , All Babies Equal ( ABAE ) program establish June 2014 Akwa Ibom improve utilization health service PMTCT . The ABAE program provide conditional cash transfer ( CCTs ) pregnant , HIV-positive woman conditional obtain specific ante- , peri- , postnatal service public facility prevent mother-to-child transmission HIV . The CCT primarily demand-side intervention aim reduce barrier woman may face seek care , well encourage uptake retention PMTCT service . Preliminary study : A large body evidence indicate provide ARV drug HIV-positive pregnant woman pregnancy time birth mother baby drastically reduce transmission virus newborn . However , Nigeria , even though drug PMTCT free available , many woman use . Additionally , knowledge mother-to-child transmission HIV PMTCT high among investigator ' target population . Recent research show 91 % woman reproductive age high awareness PMTCT southern Nigeria , yet 71 % poor attitude towards PMTCT treatment service , result low uptake service . To encourage uptake PMTCT service , ABAE 's CCT program design base research show CCT intervention increase utilization health service improve child health . CCTs initially use Latin America provide predictable sum money eligible mother certain action take , particularly health service school enrollment . The cash payouts show alleviate short- long-term poverty building human capital among traditionally underserved population ( i.e . woman child impoverished household ) . CCTs also effective HIV prevention . For example , Malawi , schoolgirl ( age 13 22 ) award one five dollar attend school significantly reduce prevalence HIV HSV-2 infection 18 month . Additionally , several study show CCTs effective way improve access adherence antiretroviral therapy reduce barrier maternal newborn health service utilization . A CCT program target increase births health facility India find significant increase uptake antenatal intrapartum care service increase facility-based delivery . As study continue evaluate efficacy CCTs , ongoing effort aim determine impact intervention transmission HIV . This study aim formally evaluate ABAE program increase retention HIV-positive pregnant woman PMTCT randomize control trial . Through combination data extract New Incentives program , facility record , survey data , researcher also investigate source poor attitude towards PMTCT service , influence non-financial barrier PMTCT retention , religious cultural norm surround delivery outside clinic setting , CCT intervention structure address full cascade PMTCT behavior without compromise operational feasibility . Main hypothesis test : Conditional cash transfer ( CCTs ) provide All Babies Are Equal ( ABAE ) program carry New Incentives , non-governmental organization ( NGO ) , improve retention HIV-positive , pregnant woman prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) service Akwa Ibom , Nigeria . Intervention procedure : Participant Screening : An ABAE program officer station study site respective antenatal registration ( i.e . `` Booking day '' ) day 8am 6pm . On Booking Day , woman test positive HIV record separate list HIV counselor lab tester duty privacy his/her office . For 1-3 woman list , names transfer ABAE officer transcribe list order appear spreadsheet pre-generated random assignment woman treatment ( i.e . offer enroll ABAE program ) control ( i.e . offer program ) group . Individuals randomize treatment arm approach ABAE officer screen verify eligibility person subject 's patient record card . In-person visit obtain informed consent : - Potential subject randomize treatment arm direct room ABAE program officer conduct enrollment process . The ABAE officer describe program woman , discuss confidentiality privacy , see woman interested participating . ABAE program officer follow standardize enrollment script per ABAE 's standard operating procedure enrollment ( see supplementary material ) . The ABAE officer explain ABAE program accompany research study , follow informed consent procedure , obtain write consent program study participation . If subject agrees participate program , ABAE program officer follow standardize intake protocol , include survey background information , enroll woman program . She also give informational brochure describe program , include requirement earn cash reward . This brochure write simple language include visual graphic facilitate easy understanding . - Women receive small cash payment mobile phone credit complete enrollment facilitate retrieval cash bank return phone call verification . Conditional Cash Transfer 1 : - The participant enrol ABAE program call New Incentives hotline morning ANC clinic visit receive payment code . If successful , receive first lump sum cash payment . Conditional Cash Transfer 2 : - A New Incentives staff member check data source contain information medication pickup antenatal care ward morning participate clinic 's Booking Day check participant meet condition second conditional cash transfer . - During enrollment , participant inform call New Incentives hotline Friday retrieve medication second time receive payment code second lump sum payment . Conditional Cash Transfer 3 : - A New Incentives staff member call participant four six week expect due date remind third cash transfer . The participant also remind facility delivery automate robot call several text message . - A New Incentives staff member check Labor Ward Registers morning participate clinic 's Booking Day check study participant meet delivery condition third conditional cash transfer . - During enrollment , participant inform call New Incentives hotline Friday birth receive payment code third lump sum payment . Conditional Cash Transfer 4 : - A New Incentives staff member call participant four five week delivers remind fourth cash transfer . Furthermore , participant receives text message regard early infant diagnosis test need take six week delivery . - A New Incentives staff member check relevant clinic register morning participate clinic 's Booking Day check participant meet condition third transfer . - During hotline call , participant inform call New Incentives hotline Friday receive newborn 's early infant diagnosis test receive payment code fourth lump sum payment . Evaluation design : The effect conditional cash transfer program primary secondary outcome assess use randomize control trial . A total 550 pregnant woman test positive HIV screen eligibility randomize 2 arm . Data collection : Prior obtain consent , HIV status individual collect ( standard procedure participate clinic ANC enrollment ) . For woman control arm , additional administrative clinic data , include first name , last name , patient number , pregnant mother number , date birth , estimate delivery date , month pregnancy , phone number collect prior obtain inform consent facilitate record track later endline phone survey . Personal identifier , however , delete data collection complete . There 3 main source data collection : 1 . Patient record extract hospital register weekly basis . Extracted record reflect information collate different facility register , include Patient Card , Laboratory Investigation Report Form , Adult Pharmacy Worksheet , ARV Counselor 's worksheet , Daily HIV Test worksheet , Nurses ' notebook , lab tester ' notebook , Delivery Register , Labor Ward Daily Report Book , Admissions Register , Child Follow-up Register , Dried Blood Spot Specimen Transport Form , Pediatric Pharmacy worksheet . 2 . ABAE program data woman treatment arm participate conditional cash transfer program . These data include information program participant obtain program enrollment survey , interim telephone call questionnaire , record cash transfer . 3 . An endline phone survey administer woman enrol study valid phone number obtain ( 8-10 week delivery ) . - At point , New Incentives employee verify subject 's identification ( i.e . recently pregnant register antenatal service specific participate clinic ) obtain verbal informed consent participate endline survey . - This contact control subject study personnel . - All individual complete phone survey receive small amount mobile phone credit compensation time . - The endline survey ask participant woman 's birth history , decision-making place delivery , perception program participation ( enrolled ABAE program ) , discrete choice experiment elicit state preference place delivery ( woman randomize control arm ) , sociodemographic background . Data analysis : 1 . Overall program effect : Our basic analysis calculate point estimate ( e.g. , achievement cash transfer condition ) reasonable precision ( i.e. , margin error ) program participant non-participants overall key sub-categories ( e.g. , facility ) base data abstract hospital record . We first calculate univariate statistic , mean retention PMTCT condition standard deviation , program participant non-participants , mean standard deviation key sub-categories . We test whether retention percentage different participant non-participants 2-tailed chi-squared test proportion significance α=0.05 . We test independent effect , confound , interaction multivariate analysis . Logistic regression analysis use test autocorrelation subject enrol facility , hausman test use assess relative fit facility random fix effect . Possible source confound include difference HIV test procedure collection patient record across facility time ( e.g . due holiday , agricultural season ) . For example , logistic regression predict likelihood deliver facility ANC seek use simultaneously assess independent effect program participation control facility site , stage pregnancy enrol , time . Sensitivity analyse conducted account know source attrition ( e.g . participant request dis-enrolled ) and/or potential source spillover across study arm ( e.g . woman control group report hear ABAE program ) . 2 . Assess difference program attrition self-reported attitude behavior control treatment arm . With response phone follow-up survey , affect unknown source attrition , study self-reported behavior perception design test one central hypothesis , involve exploratory statistical test difference self-reported behavior perception among program participant vs. non-participants overall , key sub-categories ( e.g . sociodemographic characteristic , location residence ) . Standard multiple linear regression analysis use assess individual determinant outcome change outcomes continuous outcome . Logistic regression analysis use dichotomous outcome . For ordered categorical outcome , count data , potentially censor outcome , first ass whether binomial , poisson , negative binomial distribution appropriate examine outcome 's dispersion . Depending specification test # 1 , additional adjustment autocorrelation include . Wealth index construct use standardize method follow Filmer Pritchett ( 2005 ) . 3 . Assess existence heterogeneous treatment effect . Multivariate regression also allow test interaction , whether program participation retention rate different different group patient ( e.g. , stage pregnancy , facility , newly diagnose HIV case , age ) . 4 . Determine woman 's state preference facility-based delivery . We complement primary analysis discrete choice experiment ( DCE ) . The DCE design solicit respondent ' preference several key childbirth delivery characteristic . Each DCE question ask respondent state preference hypothetical option A B . First , question , use comparison mean ( Chi-squared test ) regression analysis ( t-tests ) compare proportion respondent indicate A proportion indicating B . Second , use statistical tool , pool question overlap characteristic measure change state choice associate particularly delivery characteristic . Enrollment projection : Sample size calculate assume baseline delivery drug pickup rate 50 % , produce large possible variance . A conservative estimate effect intervention would 50 % baseline delivery rate drug collection 70 % intervention . Such result would 99.9 % power group consist 250 people . Contrary conservative calculation assume 50 % baseline , baseline rate delivery approximately 30 % clinic site drug pickup rate even low , accord clinic data . We therefore expect study result 100 % power . Power calculation carry use DS Research online power calculator . An additional 10 % upward adjustment make account possible refusal participate .
