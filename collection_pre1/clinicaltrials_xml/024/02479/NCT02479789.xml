	<brief_title>Efficacy Intravenous Lidocaine Operative Management Thyroid Surgery With Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intra Operative Nerve Monitoring ( IONM ) rapidly become standard care many institution across country . While overall incidence nerve palsy low , occur devastate lifelong handicap . Several study document routine identification RLN IONM decrease rate permanent RLN palsy It design visualize recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) , allow intra-operative assessment RLN function well establish prognosis patient develop RLN paralysis . Complete functionality IONM depend near total laryngeal relaxation reflex suppression without use neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBAs ) . The depth anesthesia require meet criterion often lead hemodynamic instability . When IONM signal unchanged resection , surgeon reassure postoperative vocal cord function normal 99.6 % case . Where IONM signal absent abnormal , 30-45 % patient develop vocal cord dysfunction postoperatively The successful deployment data analysis IONM depend upon complete laryngeal relaxation reflex suppression . The IONM cause strong contraction vocal cord independent cause laryngeal alteration . The surgical procedure strong factor stress larynx potentially traumatic manipulation level larynx . Complete functionality IONM constitute full electromyographic recovery NMB adductor pollicis muscle , laryngeal muscle recover fast peripheral muscle . The anesthetic technique choose ensure absolute laryngeal reflex suppression effect short act depolarize muscle relaxant wear immediately follow intubation , preferably extubation . Be total intravenous anesthesia inhalation-based anesthesia , depth require reflex suppression cause profound cardiovascular instability . While attempt titrate anesthetic depth cause resurface troublesome laryngeal reflex , attempt counter side effect sympathomimetic agent result myriad undesirable hemodynamic consequence . The result hemodynamic fluctuation result adverse outcome patient significant cardiovascular co-morbidities . Laryngoscopy without intubation , provoke sympathoadrenal response . These event especially detrimental individual limit myocardial reserve age disease ; include geriatric population significant coronary arteriosclerosis diabetes mellitus , sustained hypertension , angina , ischemic heart disease cardiac dysrhythmias . IV lidocaine decrease intracellular Ca2+ concentration airway smooth muscle , decrease myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity show suppress cough prevent reflex broncho constriction . Injected intravenously , lidocaine variably effective blunt hemodynamic response tracheal intubation . IV lidocaine analgesic , anti-hyperalgesic anti-inflammatory property . Local anesthetic reduce postoperative inflammatory response several way block neural transmission site tissue injury thus attenuate neurogenic inflammation . In addition anti-inflammatory property , may inhibit migration granulocyte release lysosomal enzyme , consequently lead decreased release pro-inflammatory cytokine . Pro-inflammatory cytokine induce peripheral central sensitization , lead pain augmentation ( hyperalgesia ) Because plasma half life 8 min , IV bolus 1 - 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine must follow infusion 1 - 4 mg/min adult order maintain therapeutic level 1.5 - 4 μg/mL ( 15 , 16 ) . Lidocaine side effect never report intend use , probably first clinical sign toxicity occur considerably high blood concentration ( &gt; 5 μg/mL ) , occur even IV lidocaine give continuously 14 day . Lidocaine infusion rate 1.5 mg/kg/h follow bolus 1.5 mg/kg employ newborn perform intra-operative wake-up test neurosurgery . It also use thyroidectomy 60 old patient cardiac co morbidity This prospective double blind randomize control trial do Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center . 60 consecutive patient undergo thyroidectomy use nerve monitor randomize two group thirty . One group receive IV Lidocaine infusion surgery facilitate nerve monitoring . The group receive placebo . Patient recruitment : The nurse administrator General Surgery clinic talk patient come clinic thyroid surgery inform study . A booklet explain nature study , risk benefit provide patient administrator . Patients willing participate study ask convey surgeon . After patient send pre operative medical evaluation test . Based history , physical examination , investigation medical evaluation , include exclude study . Informed consent take patient willing participate study meet inclusion criterion . This consent separate surgical consent . The day surgery : The patient come ambulatory surgery overnight fast . Vitals check patient see anesthesiologist surgeon ambulatory surgery unit . There patient wheel operating room surgery . Two day prior surgery , pharmacy notify case . The research pharmacist prepare lidocaine placebo vial accord randomization chart . This pick give anesthesiologist . In operating room : The surgery do supine position head extend use shoulder roll . Propofol Fentanyl use induction . Neuro muscular blockade routinely used surgery use surgery . Dragonfly Single Channel Laryngeal Surface Electrode ( Electrode LSE 500Ms ; Neurovision Medical Products , Ventura , CA , USA ) apply # 7 cuffed ETT ( Medline Industries , Mundelein , Illinois , USA ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . The patient pre-oxygenated induced bolus midazolam 2 mg fentanyl 1.25 μg/kg follow etomidate 0.25 mg/kg succinylcholine 1.2 mg/kg intravenously . Direct laryngoscopy do endotracheal intubation do . The nerve monitoring apparatus set placement electrode plate touch vocal cord verify vision Glidescope® , position patient desire neck extension impedence measurement . The patient clean draped.The patient receive bolus 1 mg /Kg IV lidocaine/Placebo ( 0.9 % saline ) follow 1.5 mg/KG/h IV lidocaine/Placebo ( 0.9 % saline ) infusion surgery stop extubation . Esmolol titrate bolus use blunt sympatho adrenal response intubation . Anesthesia maintain 50:50 mixture air oxygen 1 - 2 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane . IV infusion propofol 50 μg/ kg/min titrate effect maintenance . Intra operative nerve monitoring ( IONM ) use identify recurrenct laryngeal nerve . Dragonfly Single Channel Laryngeal Surface Electrode [ Neurovision Medical Products , Ventura , CA ; Electrode LSE 500Ms ] use part electromyography circuit facilitate neve monitoring . A Bispectral Index ( BIS ) monitor ( Aspect Medical Systems , Newton , MA ; Model 1 A 2000 ) use guard `` recall '' light plane anesthesia train four ( TOF ) monitor [ Microstim Plus , Neurotechnology , Houston , Texas , USA ] employ guard inadvertent neuromuscular blockade . The study design double blind randomize control trial 30 subject group receive intravenous lidocaine surgery 30 subject group receive placebo . The intended period study one year . Blunting laryngo tracheal reflex intra operatively record primary outcome . The amount anesthesia medication , post operative patient comfort level , pain control , usage narcotic pain medication , nausea , vomit record secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
