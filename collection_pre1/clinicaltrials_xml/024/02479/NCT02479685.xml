	<detailed_description>Introduction Pelvic-organ prolapse , pelvic organ ( uterus , bladder , bowel ) protrude past vaginal introitus , condition often treat surgery1,2 . Women 11 percent risk surgery prolapse urinary incontinence 80 year age , 11 percent , almost one third woman second surgery3 . This fact point need improve treatment pelvic-floor disorder . Numerous surgical procedure describe management POP . Vaginal surgery may associate less postoperative pain rapid return daily live abdominal repair4,5 . However , randomise study , sacrocolpopexy twice likely result optimal anatomical outcome vaginal surgery6 . Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy provide potential combine success rate abdominal approach faster recovery associate minimally invasive technique . Tissue dissection mesh placement may also facilitate magnification field view permit laparoscopic approach7-10 . These benefit must balance long operating time 150 250 minute accord surgeon ' experience . In addition , procedure often associate subtotal hysterectomy ( LSH ) reason prevention ( post-menopause age ) uterine disease , improve still operate time . Literature study report use electrosurgical loop decrease time require resection uterine cervix LSH benign uterine condition . Moreover LSH perform easily power morcellator removal uterus . These device facilitate increase safety procedure11,12 . However , available laparoscopic morcellators may difficult use ( weight , ergonomics , etc . ) potentially serious complication unreported medical literature13 . This prospective randomized pilot study aim verify operative time standard laparoscopic sacral colpopexy associate subtotal hysterectomy treatment POP could reduce use PKS BILL : bipolar laparoscopic loop ( laparoscopic loop use advanced bipolar energy ) ( Olympus Medical Systems Corp , Tokyo ) PKS PlasmaSORD ( Solid Organ Removal Device ) vs. conventional monopolar hook conventional mechanic morcellator . Secondary endopoints comparison incidence intra- postoperative complication estimate blood loss , postoperative pain ( evaluate VAS ) , day hospitalization cost health care system . Statistical Analysis Study Design This single Institution prospective randomize clinical trial conduct Catholic University Sacred Heart , Rome . To imbalanced result reduce bias , randomization list check . Probability ( p ) value consider statistically significant &lt; 0.05 level . There recruit 50 patient treat use PK BiLL/PKS plasmasord 50 patient treat standard monopolar hook/standard morcellator compare two technique term operative time , estimate blood loss intra- post operative complication , postoperative pain , day hospitalization , cost . All patient adequately inform insert study read sign informed consent . Diagnostic , clinical surgical data patient prospectively record . At end procedure , schedule compile intraoperative data . All clinical histologic data record prospectively use database . Pain associated procedure evaluate subjective assessment ( analysis VAS scale value report patient 8 24 hour surgery ) . Post-operative complication evaluate first 30 day surgery accord Dindo 's classification14 . Consort diagram study Study Objectives Primary endpoint To compare operative time laparoscopic sacral colpopexy associate subtotal hysterectomy treatment POP use PKS BILL PKS plasmasord technology ( bipolar laparoscopic loop bipolar morcellator ) vs. conventional monopolar hook conventional mechanic morcellator order reduce operative time . Secondary endpoint To compare - Intra- post operative complication ( Urinary , Intestinal , Nervous ) - Estimated blood loss - Postoperative pain - Days hospitalization - Costs health care system . Inclusion/exclusion criterion For patient - Age ≤ 80 year - Patient 's informed consent - American Society Anesthesiologists : &lt; class III IV - Physiologic , surgical iatrogenic menopause . - No previous major abdominal surgical procedure For disease - POP-Q stage III/IV anterior and/or apical compartment ; stage &lt; III posterior compartment . - No uterine cervix dysplasia endometrial disorder . - No uterine size large conform 10 week gestation Study procedures Standard sacral colpopexy subtotal hysterectomy With patient Trendelenburg position ( ≥30° ) , insertion 16F Foley urethral catheter , adequate pneumoperitoneum induce . Uterine manipulator use move uterus.A 10-mm laparoscope introduce umbilicus two 5-mm trocars place 2 cm medially superiorly anterosuperior iliac spine . After thorough evaluation peritoneal cavity , necessary , completion adhesiolysis , additional 5- 12-mm trocar place visual control midline half way pubic symphysis umbilicus . In case obesity short umbilicopubic length , 5-to 12-mm trocar place umbilicus 10-mm optical trocar insert midline half way xiphoid process umbilicus . The first step LSC consist locate useful anatomic landmark ( outline promontory , iliac bifurcation , leave common iliac vein , right ureter ) expose longitudinal vertebral ligament cover sacral promontory . This accomplished opening parietal peritoneum gentle sharp blunt dissection retroperitonal tissue . Median sacral vessel push back inward dissection coagulate necessary . Then peritoneal incision prolong along right pelvic wall uterine isthmus , pay careful attention ureter mesh subperitonealization schedule . The subtotal hysterectomy start . The round ligament coagulate cut enter retroperitoneum . The broad ligaments/ovarian pedicle seal bipolar diathermy divide monopolar scissors . Anterior posterior leave broad ligament peritoneum divide monopolar scissors . The incision carry anteriorly . The bladder peritoneum incise distal cervicouterine junction . Paravescical pararectal space develop . After uterine artery coagulate use bipolar diathermy monopolar forceps bladder dissection complete , supracervical separation uterus wasperformed use monopolar hook removal uterine manipulator . The uterus morcellated draw specimen morcellator ( ROTOCUT G1 Morcellator , KARL STORZ GmbH &amp; Co. KG , Tuttlingen , Germany ) . The pouch Douglas incise leave right uterosacral ligament rectovaginal space dissect along posterior vaginal wall . Margins dissection perineal body inferiorly rectovaginal ligament laterally . To cover dissection space without tension , adequately shape Prolene mesh ( Ethicon , Inc ) place fix vaginal wall five 3-0 nonabsorbable suture . The first suture apply midline perineal apex mesh . Two suture side apply middle upper portion posterolateral vaginal wall . The vesicouterine peritoneum open vesicouterine vesicovaginal space dissect along uterine vaginal wall . Dissection limit trigonal region ( emphasize Foley catheter ) inferiorly bladder pillar laterally . Also case adequately shape Prolene mesh cover dissection space without tension insert fix vaginal wall five 3-0 nonabsorbable suture . The first suture apply midline vesical apex mesh . Two suture side locate middle upper portion anterolateral vaginal wall . The peritoneum right broad ligament round ligament-ovarian ligament superiorly parametrial portion uterine vessel inferiorly incise rejoin previous right peritoneal incision , anterior mesh pass incision . The two mesh thread toward promontory visual control vagina lift prolapse vaginal wall without excessive tension . Meshes fix longitudinal vertebral ligament one 0 non-absorbable suture noncutting needle . The operation complete re-peritonealization . PKS BiLL technology Using PKS bipolar laparoscopic loop simplify cervical amputation decrease time require detachment uterine corpus , many consider difficult part laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy . In addition , loop system allow supracervical separation uterus level coagulate uterine vessel , therefore minimise risk slippage retraction vessel . The bipolar technology could add ulterior advantage term safety operate procedure time reduction . In way use PKS plasmasord bipolar morcellator could reduce risk injury . The lightness instrument could increase procedure feasibility .</detailed_description>
