	<detailed_description>This pilot study randomize , crossover , placebo control design . The Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement use guide development protocol . Ethical Approval obtain project April 2008 . A CONSORT flow diagram produce project plan crossover study design . Although primary end point study safety feasibility investigator aim look functional outcome secondary endpoint . Statistical review available literature indicate 3 % change ejection fraction ( EF ) measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) would represent meaningful change calculate 10 patient would sufficient detect mean change EF , assume SD difference 3 % 80 % power 5 % significance . For calculation assume distribution difference Normal . Calculation sample size crossover study require definition minimum difference detect . Children age 1 year 16 year review , either attend Heart Failure Clinic Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) refer admission management heart failure GOSH invite participate study . The low age limit select permit coronary artery catheterisation feasibly perform take account size patient . On recruitment patient impaired systolic function determine reduced shorten fraction echocardiogram ( 2 SD normal ) . The functional status recruit patient class 2-4 define NYHA Ross classification . Exclusion criterion need high dependency intensive care congenital heart disease , viral infection would preclude use hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory facility , active malignancy unstable cardiac drug therapy . Potential patient identify case note , family approach either telephone follow clinic review evaluate interest participation . Any patient appear interested participating study give age language appropriate write information ; also give contact telephone numberso additional information could supply require . Each family give opportunity discus study research team consent inclusion obtain . Protocol : Ten patient meet eligibility criterion recruit study . Each patient randomize entry study determine whether would receive stem cell Period One Period Two protocol . Randomisation perform use computer-generated random number table , Graph pad . Following recruitment randomisation , patient individual admission time-line plan . Those patient receive stem cell first study admission review within 28 day precede date . At review , screen infection , per hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory protocol ( include HIV hepatitis B C ) perform , follow full write consent . On day procedure patient admit cardiac day-care facility baseline observation clinical assessment . The study procedure perform Cardiac MRI theatre general anaesthetic . Blood sample take time anaesthesia routine investigation ( full blood count , urea , electrolyte , liver function NTproBNP ) . Those patient receive intracoronary stem cell admission 20mL bone marrow aspirate posterior iliac crest aseptic condition immediately induction anaesthesia . Bone marrow aspiration technique : Those patient anticoagulation therapy highlight advance procedure admission , optimal coagulation management implement prior , follow bone marrow aspiration . All bone marrow processing undertaken Great Ormond Street Hospital cell therapy processing facility . Following anaesthetic induction secure stable airway patient position permit bone marrow aspiration . Full aseptic condition observe throughout procedure . A volume 20 mL bone marrow aspirate single needle puncture site use heparinized 10mL syrinx attach bone marrow needle follow removal central trocar . The aspirated bone marrow transfer sterile heparinized universal specimen bottle . Immediately aspiration bone marrow sample take cell therapy laboratory mononuclear cell separation use standard technique gradient centrifugation . The mononuclear cell separation protocol take approximately 90 minute complete . The bone marrow sample process provide 1mL intra-coronary injection 1mL cryogenically frozen phenotypic analysis later date . A small aliquot stem cell suspension analyse obtain total mononuclear cell count per millilitre . This cell count represent total number mononuclear cell inject via intra-coronary catheterisation . In addition cell viability also assess . Whilst wait prepared stem cell , cardiac MRI scan perform use breath hold protocol image acquisition . Following MRI scan patient transfer mean mechanized slide table back angiography suite . On return angiography suite patient maintain general anaesthesia notice give stem cell laboratory stem cell process nearing completion . Following contact stem cell laboratory arterial sheath place femoral artery study patient advance tip sit leave main coronary artery . Partial occlusion coronary artery observe demonstrated ST segment change damp pressure trace routinely monitor procedure . The 1mL volume slowly injected via coronary artery catheter leave main coronary artery follow 1mL 0.9 % saline flush period 2 minute . Following intracoronary injection stem cell suspension cardiac catheter remove haemostasis skin entry site achieve . The patient woken recover standard manner . Patients admit cardiac ward overnight routine monitoring arterial catheterisation access site bone marrow aspiration site ; cardiac care observation continue throughout . Patients discharge follow day electively review outpatient 's clinic three month post-procedure advise contact Research Fellow sooner concern . Cross-over intervention occur six month stem cell group receive placebo via cardiac catheterisation ( bone marrow harvest require placebo arm study ) second occasion . The admission , monitor follow arranged stem cell stage study . The placebo use intracoronary injection use 1mL 0.9 % saline , consistent placebo solution use adult study . The 1mL placebo follow 1mL 0.9 % saline flush correlation stem cell arm study . An interim clinic review arrange three month post procedure follow cardiac MRI scan six month . The time scale choose review available adult literature show effect leave ventricle usually see within 6 month . Those patient randomly allocate placebo stage one study cross receive stem cell stage two . Interim final follow arrangement stem cell placebo group . Anaesthesia standardize patient anaesthetist used procedure . Bone marrow preparation also standardize performed scientist case . Computer data entry double-checked . Patient identifier remove anonymous image allow blind analysis later ; way unbiased image analysis perform . A single researcher use Osirix software perform off-line analysis data . As second check data researcher 's result evaluate , blind patient identifier , second analyser . The key blinding MRI data devise , apply store securely clinician otherwise involve study . Indexed value correct data age , sex , height weight permit true comparison make series study individual different individual . Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome measure freedom death transplantation complication could consider related bone marrow injection anaesthesia ( infection/malignancy/anaphylaxis/renal deterioration ) . A safety monitoring committee , include cardiologist Great Ormond Street Hospital involve trial , external cardiologist lay representative , establish . Any adverse event report committee empower halt trial time concern arose . Secondary outcome measure : Ejection fraction , leave ventricular volume mass derive cardiac MRI . Blood take NT proBNP . In addition functional status assess New York Heart Association classification Ross classification young child . Each patient cardiac MRI general anaesthetic . The anaesthetist anaesthesia protocol patient . All image obtain 1.5-T MR scanner ( Avanto , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) use 12-element phased-array coil signal reception body coil signal transmission . A vector ECG system use cardiac gating . Left ventricular ( LV ) volume measure contiguous short-axis steady state free precession cine cover ventricle ( 7-13 slice , depend size child ) . Each slice acquire single 10- 15-second breath hold previously describe . All image processing perform use in-house plug-in open-source Osirix DICOM ( digital imaging communication medicine ) software . The LV end-diastolic volume ( EDV ) end-systolic volume ( ESV ) measure manual segmentation endocardial border short-axis data . Careful segmentation basal slice conjunction 4-chamber LV long-axis view perform overcome problem delineate mitral valve . Ventricular stroke volume ( SV ) difference EDV ESV , ventricular ejection fraction ( % ) ( SV/EDV ) Ã—100 . For secondary end point , EDV , ESV EF , comparison treatment make intention treat basis . A crossover analysis post treatment measure conduct use analysis variance model , consider sequence , period treatment effect . Carry-over effect test first evidence significant effect , treatment effect test . A subsequent generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) model fit allow adjustment baseline measure . Where distribution data clearly non-Normal investigator use logarithmic transformation . Stata use statistical analysis test two-sided . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
