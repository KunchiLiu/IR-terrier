	<brief_title>LUCY Study : TriVascular Evaluation Females Who Are Underrepresented Candidates Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LUCY Study prospective , consecutively enrol , non-randomized multi center post-market registry evaluate Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Platform use endovascular treatment female patient . The primary endpoint Major Adverse Event ( MAE ) rate within 30 day initial procedure . MAEs adjudicate report base upon independent Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) . Secondary endpoint study achieve demonstrate benefit female patient ( Treatment Group ) comparable male patient ( Control Group ) despite fact historically few female patient eligible EVAR , experience high rate access-related complication high mortality rate . Secondary endpoint evaluate 1 year ( 365 ± 60 day ) post-procedure . A maximum 45 site across United States expect enroll 225 subject ( 75 female Treatment Group 150 male Control Group ) .</detailed_description>
