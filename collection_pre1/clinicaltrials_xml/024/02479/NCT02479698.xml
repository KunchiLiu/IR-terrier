	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) help control BK viral infection JC viral infection . Researchers also want learn safety give CTLs patient BK and/or JC infection . CTLs make donate blood cell grown laboratory design kill virus cause infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BK Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes ( CTL ) Lines Stem Cell Transplant ( SCT ) Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CTL Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive CTLs vein ( also call infusion ) 30 minute . You stay clinic 1 hour CTL infusion check side effect may . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If doctor think best interest , receive another infusion CTLs least 2 week first infusion . You may receive 8 infusion . If receive multiple infusion CTLs , least 2 week infusion . Study Visits Patients BK Infection : - Within 1 week infusion : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check BK infection . Within 72 hour infusion : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect routine test within 72 hour infusion . - You chest x-ray check infection . Right infusion Weeks 2 4 Months 3 6 infusion : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn way T-cells ( type white blood cell ) work body . - You complete questionnaire symptom . The questionnaire take minute complete time . Right infusion Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 Months 3 , 6 , 12 infusion , physical exam . During physical exam , check possible reaction study drug , include graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) every week Week 1 Week 6 infusion . GVHD occur donor cell attack cell person receive stem cell transplant . During Weeks 1-4 Months 3 6 infusion , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw 1 time week routine test check BK infection . Starting infusion , may blood test do either MD Anderson local oncologist 's office . If perform locally , result send study staff . The study staff discus option . Study Visits Patients JC Infection : - Within 1 week infusion : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You chest x-ray MRI check status infection . - You lumbar puncture check status infection . To perform lumbar puncture ( also call spinal tap ) , special needle insert low back space bone . The needle use draw sample fluid surround spinal cord . Within 72 hour infusion : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You chest x-ray . - If BK infection , urine collect routine test check BK infection . Right infusion Weeks 1-6 Months 3 , 6 , 12 infusion , physical exam . During physical exam , check possible reaction study drug , include GVHD every week Weeks 1-6 . During Weeks 1-4 Months 3 6 infusion , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw 1 time week routine test check JC infection . Right infusion Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , Months 6 12 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn way T-cells ( type white blood cell ) work body . Starting infusion , may blood test , lumbar puncture , MRIs do either MD Anderson local oncologist 's office . If perform locally , result send study staff . The study staff discus option . Length Study : You longer able receive CTL infusion ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 1 year . This investigational study . The use CTLs treat BK infection JC infection FDA-approved commercially available . CTLs currently use research purpose . Up 50 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative autologous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell single double umbilical cord blood . 2 . Patients microscopic hematuria urine blood PCR positive BK virus and/or JC viral encephalitis . 3 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid le 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone . 4 . Patients currently receive treatment cidofovir , leflunomide , antiviral therapy response , eligible CTL infusion . 5 . Written inform consent and/or sign assent patient , parent guardian . 6 . Negative pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential , define postmenopausal 12 month previous surgical sterilization . Women child bear potential must willing use effective contraceptive measure study . 1 . Patients receive prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day time enrollment , receive ATG within 14 day receive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Campath within 28 day enrollment . 2 . Patients uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 3 . Patients active acute GVHD grade IIIV .</criteria>
