	<brief_summary>Background : The aim present clinical study evaluate predictive value baseline inter-dental papilla height ( IPH ) , avascular expose root surface area ( AERSA ) inter-dental clinical attachment loss ( CAL ) measurements complete root coverage ( CRC ) single gingival recession ( GR ) defect treat coronally advanced flap connective tissue graft technique ( CAF+CTG ) . Material Methods : The study group include 65 female 57 male , age 20 42 year . A total 122 recession defect without CAL amount CAL equal small buccal CAL , locate upper low incisor canine treat CAF+CTG . IPH , AERSA CAL parameter analyze possible correlation CRC 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) connective tissue graft ( CTG ) confirm gold standard treatment gingival recession ) . CTG-based procedure provide best outcomes superior percentage mean root coverage ( MRC ) complete root coverage ( CRC ) keratinize tissue ( KT ) gain . Data previous report show CRC range 18 % 83 % CAF+CTG Miller Classes I II defect associate inter-dental clinical attachment loss ( interdental-CAL ) ( Recession Type 1-RT1 ) The use CTG CAF significantly enhance probability achieve CRC ( % 57 ) recession interdental-CAL equal small buccal attachment loss ( Recession Type 2-RT2 ) . It emphasize CRC percentage similar result ( 60 % ) multicentre study treatment RT1 recession ( Cortellini et al . 2009 ) . Moreover , CRC high report treatment RT1 Miller I II defect ( 80 % ) baseline interdental-CAL 1 3 mm Therefore , various CRC outcomes literature indicate need additional defect define criterion predict outcome root coverage ( RC ) RT 1 RT2 ( interdental-CAL≤ 3mm ) recession defect . Predetermination final RC important distinguishing 'expected versus actual ' amount RC find related inter-dental papilla height ( IPH ) inter-dental clinical attachment level ( ICAL ) clinical study report correlation two anatomical characteristic CRC . Recently new predictive classification gingival recession use baseline avascular expose root surface area ( AERSA ) identification criterion propose . AERSA result strong predictor final RC laterally position flap ( LPF ) lead prognostic model AERSA explain 86 % mean root coverage . In addition , due anatomic variation , Miller Class I defect may large AERSA Miller Class II III defect may small Miller Class III defect Miller Class I II defect may significantly influence treatment result . These result could help explain outcome variation among previous study . The prognostic anticipation certain amount RC complex process include patient-related , tooth/site-related ( GRD , root abrasion , ICAL , tooth type , dimension inter-dental papilla , AERSA ) technique-related ( e.g . quality CTG ) factor operator 's skill . It essential define potent prognostic factor ' combination increase success predictability rate , make CAF+CTG convenient RC technique patient clinician . Therefore aim study explore predictive value baseline IPH , AERSA ICAL measurement final RC outcome CAF+CTG RT1 RT2 class GR defect .</detailed_description>
