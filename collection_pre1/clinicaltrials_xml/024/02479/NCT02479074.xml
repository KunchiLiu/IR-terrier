	<detailed_description>Patients attend unit part normal outpatient ' appointment approach regard whether interested take part study . During outpatient appointment new chronic cough patient undertake Demographics assessment , full blood count , spirometry test , FeNO measurement concomitant medication part standard medical care . If patient decides take part study visit test outside standard medical care include , sputum induction , completion Leicester cough questionnaire , cough challenge 24 hr cough monitoring screen visit . All data collect term clinic visit additional test analyse study . 40 patient chronic cough FeNO≥30 ppb enrol High FeNO Treatment Groups . They randomise 1:1 ratio receive either : Montelukast 10 mg daily four week Prednisolone 20 mg daily two week follow two week Montelukast 10 mg. 20 subject chronic cough FeNO≤20 ppb enrol low FeNO Treatment Group receive montelukast 10 mg 28 day . The study consist five visit unit . The first visit combine patient schedule clinic appointment . During visit investigator carry preliminary assessment check medical history , physical examination , full blood count vital sign . Demographics assessment , spirometry test , FeNO measurement concomitant medication record per schedule clinic visit . Further test conduct regard study , test include : sputum induction , cough challenge , Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire ( HARQ ) , Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) 24h cough monitoring test operate baseline 2 week 4 week treatment . Also pregnancy test woman child bear potential require study . At end visit 1 , patient receive 14 28 day ' supply randomise study medication . Visit 2 ( 13th day ) visit 4 ( 27th day ) : Participants ask come unit The Hull Automated Cough Counter apply measure cough frequency 24 hour end treatment . Visit 3 ( 14th day ) visit 5 ( 28th day ) : Patients assessed adverse event change concomitant medication use trial also vital sign check . After FeNo measurement , Pulmonary Function Tests , cough challenge , sputum induction , 24h cough monitoring , Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire ( HARQ ) Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) repeat compare first assessment . At end study patient review chronic cough registrar/consultant per standard care clinic patient .</detailed_description>
