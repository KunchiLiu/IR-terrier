	<brief_summary>The Mayo Clinic psychiatric pharmacogenomic team develop pharmacogenomic algorithm design improve effectiveness safety antidepressant medication provide guidance medication selection appropriate dosing . This algorithm incorporate new genotyping interpretative report . This report available AssureRx . The pharmacogenomic algorithm base genotyping copy four informative gene . These four gene : 1 ) Cytochrome P450 2D6 gene ; 2 ) Cytochrome P450 2C19 gene ; 3 ) Serotonin Transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) ; 4 ) Serotonin 2A receptor gene ( 5HTR2A ) . Though algorithm yet part universal standard care , Mayo clinicians find helpful guide treatment decision Mayo Clinic Rochester .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Impact Antidepressant Pharmacogenomic Algorithm Outpatient Therapy-based Clinical Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose pilot study design evaluate clinical impact interpretive report outpatient behavioral health clinic St. Paul , Minnesota . While ultimate goal project show improvement patient outcome , pilot study use evaluate feasibility introduce pharmacogenomic algorithm new set routinely use algorithm . Secondary outcome data collect generate meaningful estimate magnitude potential treatment effect . The study consist two phase , enrol 2530 subject . In Phase 1 , consecutive patient prospectively monitor observe standard practice . Patients give option receive genotyping agree blood drawn . However , result genotyping algorithm release phase 1 patient complete study visits.. Subsequently , Phase 2 , also enrol 3025 subject , result genotyping algorithm make available immediately additional consecutive prospectively monitored patient . Patients prospectively monitored fashion Phase 1 . The result study used perform preliminary analysis subsequent fully power multi-site trial plan base result study .</detailed_description>
