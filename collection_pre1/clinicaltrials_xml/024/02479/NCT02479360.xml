	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) inherit condition occur 1 2,500 births; affect skin , bone nervous system . The complication NF1 widespread lead vary difficulty dependent location neurofibroma secondary complication . One person NF1 may minimal issue whereas another may profoundly disabled; one may difficulties use hand arm another may difficulties stand chair . New pharmacological nonpharmacological treatment NF1 currently develop potential dramatically influence person NF1 's life . At present evaluation treatment effect NF1 base clinician 's neurological assessment , magnetic resonance image positron emission tomography apparent image result always link clinical functional change individual . Therefore clinicians researcher agree analysis treatment effect need include evaluation person 's function . The finding study improve care people NF1 ensure able measure functional change person NF1 great confidence , mean start , continue cease treatment base holistic picture individual . The world confederation physiotherapist ( WCPT ) stipulate standardised outcome measure ( SOM ) use provide quantitative measure capability , evaluate impact treatment function . There wide range SOM 's evaluate function ( e.g . walking , stand chair , use hand ) SOM choose clinician base patient 's presenting functional difficulty scientific credibility SOM . Scientific credibility ( robustness ) base scientific property SOM i.e . stable SOM ( reliability ) whether ass intend ass ( validity ) . It important evaluate SOM within target population variability within condition , strongly influence SOM 's reliability validity ( de Vel 2011 ) . At present , functional SOM 's limited scientific subsequent clinical credibility use people NF1 scientific property yet evaluate within patient group mean use clinically within research , inherent element doubt interpret SOM 's result . The objective research team create core set functional SOM 's undergone rigorous scientific evaluation use future clinical practice research purpose adult NF1 . This study aim evaluate four commonly use SOM 's reliability adult NF1 ( 16 year age ) . The measure choose evaluation 10 metre walk test , time go test , functional reach test nine hole peg test . Interrater reliability ( test result remain review different people ) intrarater reliability ( test result remain stable review twice tester ) evaluate . From data , able calculate standard error measurement additional important scientific characteristic SOM evaluation .</detailed_description>
