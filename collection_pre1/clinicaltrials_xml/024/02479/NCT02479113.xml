	<detailed_description>The prevalence gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) worldwide increase , accelerate rate obesity woman child-bearing age , increase maternal age improve survival low high birth weight ( BW ) female offspring modern time . GDM prevalence rate know high Asian population compare Western population . The incidence rate amongst South Indians India , Malaysians urban tertiary centre Kuala Lumpur 14 11.4 % respectively Western population GDM account 2-9 % pregnancy . It well-established exposure intrauterine diabetic milieu , pregnant woman type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) GDM , imparts increase future risk diabetes , obesity , metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease offspring . Besides maternal hyperglycemia , strong link maternal pregravid weight/maternal triglyceride ( Tg ) level fetal growth/childhood obesity/metabolic syndrome offspring demonstrate largely Caucasian population . The mechanisms developmental origins adult disease however poorly understood . The utero environment via change epigenome involve alteration DNA sequence exert stimulatory inhibitory effect fetal growth adiposity6 . It propose pathological metabolic milieu utero result fetal epigenetic change DNA methylation histone modification , thus modulate biological process related intrauterine development , gene expression , chromatin accessibility , DNA replication , imprint human disease pattern . Lipotoxicity adult well-established result development insulin resistance pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction . Much emphasis already give management maternal hyperglycemia pregnancy . It possible however maternal hypertriglyceridemia hand soon become therapeutic target fight childhood diabetes obesity . Normal pregnancy associate physiological increase Tg 10 week gestation onwards ; 2-3 fold increase serum Tg level 3rd trimester . These elevation attribute enhanced hepatic production VLDL , increase intestinal absorption dietary lipid , reduce clearance Tg due decrease extra-hepatic lipoprotein lipase activity reduce insulin sensitivity pregnancy . Even , Tg level pregnancy know high woman T2DM GDM compare healthy pregnant control . Maternal hypertriglyceridemia independent maternal glucose link increased BW fetal adiposity offspring Caucasian woman . This association show hold true woman GDM well Normal Glucose Tolerance ( NGT ) risk factor GDM . Maternal hypertriglyceridemia even link pre-eclampsia . Indeed , fact Langer et al , demonstrate insulin therapy result low macrosomia rate obese GDM woman diet therapy despite equivalent glycemic control seem indicate metabolic target besides glucose modulated insulin therapy play . It highly likely 'invisible ' metabolic variable maternal triglyceride . Determining early predictor development metabolic syndrome ( MS ) offspring enable target childhood intervention program . In Western population establish pregravid maternal BMI strong independent predictor childhood obesity/MS whereas birth weight GDM alone poor correlate offspring obesity risk metabolic syndrome . In Boney et al 's cohort Caucasian offspring evaluate age 6 , example , combination large gestational age ( LGA ) status maternal GDM associate OR 10.4 insulin resistance offspring age 11yrs increase prevalence MS age . However prevalence MS offspring significantly different offspring mother NGT whether LGA/average gestational age ( AGA ) , AGA offspring GDM mother . Neither maternal GDM alone LGA birth independently associate insulin resistance . Maternal obesity alone however independently confer approximate increase hazard MS 2-fold 11 year age whereas GDM status alone . The risk develop MS GDM offspring diverge LGA AGA status age 7 , time child 11 year old risk 3.6 fold great LGA compare AGA offspring GDM mother . Alarmingly 50 % GDM offspring LGA status birth least 2 4 criterion MS age-point age 6-11 year . These association relationships however less well-delineated Asian population . In addition , much data , include Boney et al 's base diagnostic definition GDM alter since evidence obtain HAPO study . It possible Malaysian GDM offspring may develop high risk metabolic syndrome age young 7 year therefore require intervention program age school attendance . Hence need study evaluate metabolic health GDM offspring local Malaysian setting base current diagnostic criterion GDM enable effective intervention program tailor local setting base local data . There also evidence Caucasian Hong Kong Chinese offspring utero hyperinsulinemia independent predictor abnormal glucose tolerance childhood . In Hong Kong Chinese offspring , cord blood insulin predictive abnormal glucose tolerance child age 8 year ( OR 6.12 ) whereas BW &gt; 4kg , indicate perhaps Asians well , BW poor early predictor risk metabolic dysfunction . Evidence indicate dyslipidemia precedes development dysglycemia offspring GDM mother subtle difference Caucasians Asians regard component lipid profile impair . Studies show hypertriglyceridemia prevalent dysglycemia Caucasian GDM offspring age 7-11 year , whereas low HDL common Hong Kong Chinese GDM offspring age 8 . Leptin establish candidate gene pathogenesis obesity diabetes . It secrete adipocytes placental tissue involve energy metabolism insulin sensitivity control . Leptin level increase obesity , diabetes pregnancy . 2hr post-OGTT glucose level show correlate placental leptin gene methylation level pregnant woman impair glucose tolerance increase placental leptin gene methylation associate decreased fetal leptin gene expression . 2 hour plasma glucose however explain 19-28 % DNA methylation variability leptin gene locus . The relationship maternal hypertriglyceridemia placental leptin gene methylation/leptin gene expression however well study . It possible maternal triglyceride level also associate alteration placental leptin gene methylation thus lead increase fetal adiposity . These change leptin gene DNA methylation adaptation potentially important may part mechanism whereby utero diabetic milieu result fetal programming i.e . induction permanent change cellular structure function offspring result adult metabolic dysfunction/obesity . Plasma leptin know play important neurotrophic role hypothalamic development . It hypothesize alteration leptin homeostasis utero may disrupt neuronal connection nuclei control energy balance appetite hypothalamus perhaps leading obesity . Insulin resistance key feature T2DM implicate early pathogenesis disease . Micro-RNA 29 implicated development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes vitro . Micro-RNAs small untranslated/non-coding RNAs negatively regulate mRNA translation . MiRNAs involve biological function cell growth proliferation , development , differentiation , organogenesis metabolism therefore link pathogenesis diabetes . In vitro study adipocyte cell line show genetic upregulation overexpression miRNA 29 ( , b , c ) family occur presence hyperglycemia block insulin-stimulated glucose uptake adipocyte inhibit insulin signal via Akt pathway ( hence expression GLUT4 surface cell membrane ) . MiRNA 29 also upregulated skeletal muscle rat model insulin resistance . There also evidence miRNA 29 elevate presence high NEFA level lead skeletal muscle insulin resistance ( unpublished data , personal communication , Zierath IDF 2013 ) . Skeletal muscle primary site glucose uptake postprandially , account 75 % insulin-mediated glucose removal plasma . Elevated miR29 also associate reduced insulin secretion . Human vivo evidence link miRNA 29 insulin resistance elevate NEFA however lack . Pregnancy meta-inflammatory state associate markedly elevated level triglyceride , cytokine NEFA obese dysglycemic woman . It possible fetal exposure high NEFA level woman gestational diabetes result elevate fetal miRNA 29 birth would positively correlated measure insulin resistance HOMA2- % S . Removal glucolipotoxic milieu parturition could result reduction miRNA 29 time reduce insulin resistance . There however dearth prospective large study examine relationship pregravid BMI/maternal hypertriglyceridemia Asian mother GDM , metabolic health offspring birth childhood . Limited data Korean woman GDM Japanese pregnant woman NGT positive diabetic screen available little research carry Southeast Asia . In addition Asian study examine link maternal triglyceride BW offspring body composition . Maternal hypertriglyceridemia associate increase BW adiposity birth , study look association maternal hypertriglyceridemia body weight/ adiposity childhood either Asian Caucasian population . There consensus , even western population , normal range maternal triglyceride level different stage pregnancy . Given well-established fact adult adiposity great Asians compare Caucasians BMI , one could hypothesize association maternal hyperlipidemia offspring adiposity metabolic health strong Asians . Asian mother know twice likely GDM low BMI . Indeed already evidence correlation maternal triglyceride level birth weight strong Asian-born GDM woman compare Australian European-born mother . It also possible Malaysian mother BMI consider non-obese range Caucasian mother i.e . 23-30 kg/m2 might offspring metabolic dysfunction . These association study Malaysian GDM offspring Malay , Chinese Indian descent . In recent time trans-generational impact maternal nutrition , via fetal epigenetic change , metabolic health offspring recognize . Given difference , current historical , socioeconomic development impact population health/wealth Western Europe/North America country India , China Malaysia would reasonable postulate maternal hypertriglyceridemia may large impact health offspring develop nation sudden transition poverty relative wealth . It worth evaluate relationship maternal metabolic characteristic pregnancy , offspring metabolic health , growth development Chinese Indian Malaysians relationship may differ derived study do Korea , Japan , Hong Kong , China India give markedly different historical trajectory socio-economic development amongst even Asian country . Very little work also do amongst mother GDM Malay descent ethnic group mainly find South-east Asia i.e . Malaysia Indonesia . With mind , design prospective observational longitudinal cohort study examine association pregravid BMI maternal hypertriglyceridemia Asian GDM mother placental epigenetic change placental leptin gene offspring adiposity/metabolic function birth/during childhood . We also aim evaluate cord blood miRNA29 birth 6 month age . This study also evaluate 2nd 3 rd trimester serum triglyceride range lean obese Asian pregnant woman Normal Glucose Tolerance . The study require participation researcher 5 discipline : obstetrics , genetics , neonatology , paediatric endocrinology adult endocrinology .</detailed_description>
