	<brief_summary>Postoperative bleeding common consequence heart surgery significantly impact outcome cost [ Wynne R , Christensen MC , Dixon B ] . When bleed occurs , reliable postoperative blood evacuation pleural , mediastinal pericardial space chest tube imperative facilitate pulmonary re-expansion mediastinal decompression patient recovers . When postoperative blood evacuation inadequate , retain blood complication result ( herein describe Retained Blood Complications ( RBC ) . RBC presence post-operative pericardial and/or pleural fluid blood diagnose may necessitate drainage acute sub-acute setting . The need treatment intervention condition represent impediment patient recovery involve resource economic consumption heart program healthcare system large . Clinically , Retained Blood Complications ( RBC ) recognize acutely subacutely . When present acutely , usually fresh thrombus around heart lung present tamponade hemothorax . When present subacutely , result bloody pleural pericardial effusion . These effusion often drive breakdown remain thrombus . Once RBC occurs , subsequent procedure may need remedy . A recent review literature indicate additional procedure RBC demonstrate approximately 15 % 20 % patient heart surgery . In prospectively collect United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data 2010 , RBC could demonstrate 17 % patient . In analysis , mortality double 4 % 8 % , length stay increase 5 day , average cost 55 % high . Patients RBC , therefore , represent increase risk population complication cost . Postoperative obstruction conventional chest tube blood fibrinous material set postoperative bleeding contributes RBC . ( Shalli ) In recent study postoperative cardiac surgery patient Cleveland Clinic , 36 % patient find evidence chest tube obstruction . Active Clearance PleuraFlow show prevent chest tube clogging , reduce RBC .</brief_summary>

This prospective multicenter observational post-market study retrospective component . The study open five ( 5 ) German sit enrol consecutive cohort cardiac surgery patient . There two condition participation registry . First , sit require enter study database anonymized matched historical data element cohort cardiac surgery patient do precede 12 24-month period ( Phase 0 ) . These retrospective data element use baseline information purpose comparative analysis prospective data set . Second , sit use PleuraFlow System enrol patient study require participate roll-in phase ( Phase 1 ) . The purpose roll-in phase allow user participate site familiarize product use ACT , implement Clinical Use Protocols provide ClearFlow , Inc. commercial user part product training , demonstrate consistency compliance clinical use protocol .</detailed_description>
