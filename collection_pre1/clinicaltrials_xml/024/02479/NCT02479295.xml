	<brief_summary>This study compare result straight versus coil Tenckhoff catheter peritoneal dialysis patient . Recent meta-analysis peritoneal dialysis catheter type favor straight catheter . The effect straight versus coil peritoneal dialysis catheter , however , unclear . The investigator design adequately power randomize control study evaluate two type double-cuffed peritoneal dialysis catheter . The primary objective ass whether straight peritoneal dialysis catheter reduce risk catheter dysfunction require intervention . The investigator estimate would need enroll 132 incident peritoneal dialysis patient group study 80 % power detect difference 7 % 15 % primary endpoint catheter dysfunction require intervention .</brief_summary>
