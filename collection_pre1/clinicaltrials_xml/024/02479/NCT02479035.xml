	<brief_title>Red Raspberries Insulin Action</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study randomize , 3-arm , diet-controlled , cross-over study use multi-sampling postprandial paradigm evaluate relative bioavailability absorption/kinetic profile red raspberry polyphenols consume typical American breakfast meal determine relationship finding meal-associated metabolic- oxidative- inflammatory- response relatively insulin sensitive insulin resistant individual . A planned sample size 24 recruit study . This study require one initial screen visit , 1 pre-study visit , 3 study visit . This study take 4-6 week per subject complete . The trial initiate screen visit , last 1-1.5 hour include measure subject ' height , weight , waist circumference , fast blood glucose , insulin sensitivity , body temperature , blood pressure heart rate well collect general eating , health exercise habit via questionnaire . If willing eligible participate , 3-day food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend ) give complete follow week ass subject 's baseline dietary intake pattern . Information use help subject adopt relatively low polyphenolic diet course study . Prior postprandial study visit , dinner meal provide day study visit help control visit visit variability due difference meal night study visit . Subjects arrive center fast state least 10 hour , well hydrate rest ( normal sleep ) . Each study visit require blood draw throughout visit . After evaluation subject 's health status ( via anthropometric , vital sign blood glucose measurement in-person interview ) , qualify health professional place catheter subject 's arm purpose multiple blood sample collection take initial blood draw fast state . Each subject randomize receive 1 3 meal treatment : Control meal ( 0 g red raspberry ) , red raspberry meal 1 [ ~125 g fresh weight ( 1 cup equivalent ) ] red raspberry meal 2 [ ~250 g fresh weight ( 2 cup equivalent ) ] , base randomization sequence 3 Study Day Visits . At Study visit , first blood draw ( 0 h ) , subject served standard breakfast meal ( moderate high fat/carbohydrate ) along fruit variable base order randomly select computer generate sequence . From point forward , blood collection occur follow time point : 0.5 h , 1 h , 2 h , 3 h , 4 h , 5 h , 6 h , 6.5 h , 7 h , 8 h 24 h test polyphenol metabolites metabolic marker . After 6h blood draw , standardize lunch meal ( polyphenol free ) provide subject . After 8 h blood draw , catheter remove subject arm . Subject provide dinner meal ( low polyphenol ) take home ask consume anything else provide dinner meal except plain water . Subject schedule come back next morning 24 h blood sample collection .</detailed_description>
