	<detailed_description>The development surgical site infection ( SSI ) clean-contaminated surgery regard preventable . Known effective prevention surgical site infection adequate sterilization surgical instrument , asepsis operation , antibiotic prophylaxis indicate , certainly preparation skin incision site , since patient 's skin principal source bacterial contamination wound . Products generally use preoperative preparation skin iodophores ( povidone-iodine ) , product contain alcohol and/or chlorhexidine . To date , literature quite number case study , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) compare different method preparation skin site surgery . Only recently major study compare 2 mode skin preparation surgery perform publish , least 2 systematic review various method find . At present , use chlorhexidine alcohol see effective povidone-iodine prevention surgical site infection , data derive available study sufficient definitely support change daily practice , quantitative evaluation pharmaco-economics implication still miss . This study aim investigate efficacy prevention surgical site infection clean surgery , use two different standardize method skin preparation : povidone-iodine 10 % aqueous solution 1.5 liter bulk bottle , versus tint 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % isopropyl alcohol single-dose applicator . To reduce variable involve , single-center study enroll homogeneous population , undergo breast cancer surgery . The patient include study randomize accord week receive surgical treatment . The investigator expect approach easy manage within study . The randomly assign treatment weekly communicate chief nurse operating theatre supply proper disinfectant without role study . All patient schedule least one follow visit 2 week surgery . All patient access follow visit , need , ask report kind wound complication . The wound assessment make person aware treatment arm patient assign , define protocol assessment , base Centers Disease Control prevention ( CDC ) definition , provide follow classification : 1. absence infection ; 2. superficial wound infection ; 3. deep wound infection . The final follow-up visit patient evaluate conducted 30 day ( patient without insertion prosthesis / expander ) 180 day ( patient insertion implant / expander ) .</detailed_description>
