	<brief_summary>This research do see resistance exercise ( RE ) safe positive effect child young adult juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) . JIA inflammatory autoimmune disease cause severe impairment disability . JIA cause bone loss decrease muscle strength . The medication use treat JIA also negative effect growth development , strength , ability function . RE perform movement slow control fashion ( i.e. , speed use force lift lower weight ) lessen force joint tissue . This study use Ren-Ex exercise equipment perform RE . Currently American College Rheumatology recommend exercise patient arthritis . This exercise include range motion exercise protect joint mobility well low resistance aerobic exercise ( AE ) protect muscle mass , bone health , fitness . However , recent study show major difference functionality quality life patient perform AE perform AE . There need data impact RE child JIA . Children young adult age 10 21 juvenile idiopathic arthritis may join .</brief_summary>
