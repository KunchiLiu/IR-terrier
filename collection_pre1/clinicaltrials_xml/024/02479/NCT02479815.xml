	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety iron supplementation MNPs . A quasi-experimental matched-control cluster design use , purposely select , 18 intervention 18 matched-control cluster Oromia South Nations Nationalities People ( SNNP ) region Ethiopia . A total 2340 infant 6-11 month age , intervention non-intervention cluster enrol follow longitudinally 12 month . Morbidity data use standardized questionnaire , collect baseline , every two week period 12 month Research question answer study : 1 . Is provision low dose iron-containing Micronutrient Powders ( MNPs ) young child without iron deficiency safe , assessed morbidity infectious disease ? 2 . What impact provision low dose iron-containing Micronutrient Powders ( MNPs ) young child ( body ) iron status ? Morbidity data collect baseline , every two week cohort child . Body iron status assess baseline endline measure serum ferritin , serum transferrin receptor , hemoglobin concentration , CRP AGP . In addition data follow outcomes collect child : 1 . Anthropometry ( weight , height , MUAC ) every 4 month 2 . Breastfeeding status consumption process complementary food portion previous week -every 4 month 3 . Compliance study intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For morbidity assessment 65 eligible child per cluster ( 18 intervention 18non-intervention village ) total 2340 randomly select The sample size calculate base expect 12 % increase incidence overall diarrhoea 30 % decrease anemia intervention group . The investigator assume investigator able detect increase 80 % power 95 % confidence interval , assume 10 % drop-out design effect two . - Morbidity infectious disease assess mean standardize recall questionnaire . Data collect follow symptom : diarrhea , respiratory sign , fever illness . Children require medical treatment examine Health Officer health center follow standard protocol Federal Ministry Health . - Biochemical iron status assess non-fasting venous morning blood sample . Blood sample keep cool serum separate frozen -20oC within 3 hour collection . Hemoglobin , serum ferritin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , soluble transferrin receptor AGP assess follow standardized methodology laboratory Ethiopian Public Health Institute ( EPHI ) . - Anthropometry : Trained field staff collect duplicate measurement every four month weight , recumbent length ( infant ) height ( child &gt; 12 month ) use standardize method high quality equipment . Z-scores length-for-age ( LAZ ) , weight-for-age ( WAZ ) weight-for-length ( WLZ ) calculate , use 2006 WHO Child Growth Standard ; stunt , under-weight wasting define LAZ , WAZ LAZ &lt; -2 SD , respectively . - Infant feeding status . Information infant feeding status collect every four month mean standardized questionnaire . - Compliance program intervention : assessed counting number return used MNP sachet every 2 week . - Social , economic demographic characteristic : collect baseline questionnaire use Demographic Health Survey method . Data analyse intention-to-treat basis , use SPSS 19.0 statistical program . Random effect model use account repeat measure episode within child , multiple child cluster . For morbidity , number actual surveillance day count subtracting day recall data available total day follow-up . For analysis disease incidence , difference group assess random effect regression include number episode dependent , control- intervention independent , total day actual surveillance off-set term model . Longitudinal prevalence disease calculate individual percentage actual surveillance day illness . All continuous variable ( longitudinal prevalence , body iron status , mean total weight height gain ) analyse use linear mixed model use cluster , household child random effect account clustered observation . Mixed effect logistic regression analysis use evaluate binary outcome ( anemia , iron deficiency iron-deficiency anemia ) , use cluster , household child random effect . All model include follow fixed effect co-variates : child 's sex , socio-economic status , baseline value . Non-normal distributed value log-transformed . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
