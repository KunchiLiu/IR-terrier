	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study safety dendritic cell vaccine give gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient breast cancer spread beyond breast local lymph node organ body . The vaccine make natural cell find blood , call dendritic cell , peptide , small fragment protein load onto dendritic cell . This combination may help activate immune system stromal cell , cell help cancer cell survive body . Gemcitabine hydrochloride chemotherapy drug give vaccine help shrink tumor control cell may interfere activity vaccine . Interfering stromal cell help support growth cancer cell may lead death cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Type I-Polarized Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Incorporating Tumor Blood Vessel Antigen-Derived Peptides Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety gemcitabine hydrochloride ( GEM ) + alpha-type-1 dendritic cell ( αDC1 ) -tumor blood vessel antigen ( TBVA ) vaccination ( tumor blood vessel antigen peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarize dendritic cell vaccine ) . II . Assess clinical response metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) GEM + αDC1-TBVA vaccination . III . Determine clinical efficacy GEM + αDC1-TBVA vaccination generate T-helper 1 cell ( Tc1 ) immunity . IV . Correlate change myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) generation anti-TBVA T-cell immunity . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course . Beginning 3 , 7 , 10 day later , patient receive tumor blood vessel antigen peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarize dendritic cell vaccine intradermally ( ID ) follow second vaccination 7 day later . Courses may repeat least 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
