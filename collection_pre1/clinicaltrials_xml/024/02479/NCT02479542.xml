	<brief_summary>The worldwide prevalence open wound estimate approximately 200 million per year . Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) , application control vacuum open wound cavity , clinically demonstrate developed nation speed heal time open wound factor two , aid complete recovery less scar tissue . Use NPWT device feasible limited-resource setting due cost , bulk , requirement consistent electricity . This study aim follow prior clinical study establish safety efficacy simplify NPWT , assess change wound closure time wound contraction rate simplify NPWT use limited-resource setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Standard Gauze Dressings Acute Wounds Limited-Resource Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Application WiCare Wound Pump standard gauze dress result fast time definitive wound closure rate heal acute wound trauma , infection , surgery compare standard gauze dress without negative pressure . Study Design A . Single center prospective trial conduct Mbingo Baptist Hospital ( MBH ) multispecialty hospital locate North-West Cameroon provide complex surgical care . B . Phase II C. Two arm trial patient eligible wound offer entrance Phase II trial D. Blinding : Non E. Indication patient population : Acute wound secondary trauma , infection , surgical excision adult patient ( &gt; 15 year old ) F. Sample size : 100 total ; base Schoenfeld 's Method compare two-sample Log-Rank Test Power 80 % , significance level=5 % G. Random Permuted Blocks : Patients randomize block 4 use follow schema Treatment A ) WiCare , Treatment B ) Standard Dressing : AABB , ABAB , BAAB , BABA , BBAA , ABBA .</detailed_description>
