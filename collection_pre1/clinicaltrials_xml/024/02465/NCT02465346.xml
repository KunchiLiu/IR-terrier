	<detailed_description>Stroke medical emergency `` time-is-brain '' . Indeed , huge body animal experimental clinical evidence exist demonstrate reduce time thrombolytic therapy important variable prevention disability . However , stroke patient arrive hospital late type acute stroke treatment : Only estimate 19-60 % stroke patient present within 3 hour symptom onset . Today , stroke patient 3 different treatment option exist . 1 . Thrombolysis recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) effective treatment many acute stroke patient evidence several large randomize trial . 2 . More recently , mechanical clot removal via catheter develop . There currently increase evidence obstruction large brain vessel endovascular treatment superior systemic thrombolysis regard recanalization rate outcome . 3 . Patients intracranial hemorrhage profit transfer hospital neurosurgical treatment option ventricular drainage hematoma removal . However , treatment highly time sensitive due availability endovascular neurosurgical treatment option highly specialized neurovascular centre decision institution patient transport high medical financial relevance . The aim trial show feasibility , safety clinical benefit strategy diagnosis treatment directly emergency site role decision regard transfer appropriate target institution , thus potentially allow reduction time treatment delay specialize treatment also remote region . First estimation cost-effectiveness also perform .</detailed_description>
