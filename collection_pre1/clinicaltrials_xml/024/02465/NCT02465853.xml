	<brief_summary>Hemiplegic shoulder pain ( HSP ) one complication stroke . HSP would impede rehabilitation program motor recovery affect upper extremity . HSP associate impaired daily life activity prolong hospital stay stroke . Therefore , effective management important stroke patient HSP . Rotator cuff injury relate HSP . Clinically , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) use rotator cuff injury . Previous researcher report HA could provide pain relief , improve motion , increase daily activity . In study , fifty subacute stoke patient enrol . These patient allocate group A B randomly . The patient group A receive HA injection patient group B receive normal saline injection . Patients group receive injection 3 time 1st , 2nd , 3rd week . All patient still receive rehabilitation program physical therapy occupational therapy . Each patient receive physical , sonographic examination , stroke Specific Quality Life Scale ( SSQOL ) . The aim study investigate benefit HA injection pain relief , motor function recovery , life quality subacute stroke patient HSP HA injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , two-year program expect receive total case 50 subacute stroke patient hemiplegic shoulder pain . The patient randomly divide two group . In experimental group , patient ( 25 people ) accept shoulder hyaluronic acid injection pain management . In control group , patient ( 25 people ) receive 0.9 % physiological saline injection . All participant receive total 3 time shoulder injection 1st , 2nd , 3rd week . Except shoulder injection , stroke patient may receive regular rehabilitation program include physical therapy occupational therapy . All measurement include shoulder sonography , physical examination , questionnaire life quality ( SSQOL ) conduct first injection , complete shoulder injection , 3/6 month shoulder injection . Shoulder sonography use investigate shoulder soft tissue condition hemiplegic shoulder include biceps tendon , infraspinatus tendon , supraspinatus tendon , subscapularis tendon , subdeltoid bursa study . The physical examination include shoulder motion plane , shoulder sensory ( light touch , pinprick , position sense ) motor function ( Fual Meyer scale brunnstrom motor recovery stage ) , shoulder spasticity measure modify Ashworth scale , hemiplegic shoulder pain visual analog scale . The investigator use Stroke Specific Quality Life Scale evaluate quality life stroke patient HSP . In study , investigator want explore short long term effect HA injection pain relief , motor function recovery , life quality stroke patient HSP .</detailed_description>
