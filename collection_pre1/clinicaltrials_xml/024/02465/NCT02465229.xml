	<brief_summary>Biliary stricture present diagnostic therapeutic challenge clinician due unsatisfied accuracy sample modality . The major problem difficult discern malignant non-malignant stricture , patient primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) . With poor prognosis high mortality rate advance stage hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancy , early accurate diagnosis impact patient ' outcome possible surgical candidacy . Therefore , pre-operative determination malignancy help plan appropriate treatment highly desirable . Before 2000s , several diagnostic modality , include laboratory test , ultrasonography ( US ) , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , cholangiography percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography endoscopic ( PTC ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , brush cytology disclose 13 % 24 % false positive rate suspicious malignant hilar stricture . Compared recent study , ERCP brushing still suffer low sensitivity ( 41.6 % ± 3.2 % ( 99 % CI ) ) negative predictive value ( 58.0 % ± 3.2 % ( 99 % CI ) ) . In order increase diagnostic accuracy , least two sample method , include brush cytology , biopsy , fine-needle aspiration therefore recommend . One article show multimodal tissue-sampling ( Brushing + Biopsy + Fine-needle aspiration ) increase sensitivity diagnosis malignant biliary stricture 62 % . However , literature demonstrate best sequence combine sample modality yield high diagnostic accuracy . Besides , role stricture dilation different tissue sample modality still uncertain . In study , investigator want compare stricture dilation multimodal tissue-sampling , include brush cytology , intraductal suction forceps biopsy diagnosis malignant biliary stricture also assess kind sequence combine tissue-sampling modality could offer high diagnostic accuracy .</brief_summary>
