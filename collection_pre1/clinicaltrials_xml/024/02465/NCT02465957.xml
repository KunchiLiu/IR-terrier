	<brief_title>QUILT-3.009 : Study aNK Infusions Combination With ALT-803 Patients With Stage III ( IIIB ) Stage ( IV ) Merkel Cell Carcinoma ( MCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , non-randomized , open-label , phase 2 trial determine effect aNK combination ALT-803 patient stage III ( IIIB ) stage IV MCC . The study use adaptive Simon optimal two-stage design , detect efficacy signal , allow early assessment , avoids enrol large number patient case inefficacy . In original protocol , initial cohort 12 patient stage III ( IIIB ) stage IV MCC enrol treat aNK monotherapy ( first stage ) . If treatment first stage improved 4-month progression free survival ( PFS ) rate 4 % 20 % ( e.g . least 1 patient 12 patient PFS ≥ 16 week [ 4 month ] ) , study would proceed second stage , 12 patient plan enrol treated . As July 2016 , trial meet require efficacy signal define first stage continue enroll plan total 24 patient receive combination aNK ALT-803 . Any patient already receive aNK cell monotherapy receive aNK cell combination ALT-803 subsequent cycle . aNK give via IV infusion dose 2 x 10^9 cells/m^2 two consecutive day ( = 1 cycle ) every 2 week . In addition , ALT-803 administer SC 10 μg/kg first day every aNK infusion ( aNK infusion ) every 2 week .</detailed_description>
