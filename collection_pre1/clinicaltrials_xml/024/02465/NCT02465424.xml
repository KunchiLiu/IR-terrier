	<brief_title>Assessing Quality Life Tools Medullary Thyroid Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Currently available thyroid cancer quality life ( QoL ) tool tend focused issue relevant patient differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) rather medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) . As MTC neuroendocrine tumour ( NET ) patient often symptoms common patient types tumour rather patient type thyroid cancer . MTC present sporadic tumour approximately 75 % case inherit disease 25 % . The inherited form MTC constitute part Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia disorder . Patients Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) may therefore number medical condition impact quality life . Patients rare disease face additional barrier concern limit patient information resource , potential lack understand amongst family friends inevitably encounter healthcare professional experience manage rare condition . It difficult fully appreciate impact cancer diagnosis inherit syndrome , raise rise tumour marker disease symptoms patient 's quality life . Quality life multi faceted affected emotional , social functional issue well disease relate problem . Quality life tool increase information healthcare professional obtains patient thus facilitate consultation well improve patient 's satisfaction consultation . Patients raise rise tumour marker ( calcitonin carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) ) often remain physically well good performance status significant amount distress associate awareness abnormal worsen biochemical result . Once MTC spread beyond neck , curative option lack aim treatment switch maintenance quality life palliation symptom . Therapeutic intervention may include somatostatin analogue therapy , radiolabelled therapy mIBG therapy target therapy use tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib cabozantinib . It difficult decide start systemic target therapy drug significant toxicity impact quality life show achieve modest increase progression free survival overall survival . These agent take orally daily basis treatment extend year case . If investigator robust tool ass MTC relate QOL clinician may find easy select patient benefit systemic anti cancer therapy oppose simple supportive symptomatic measure . Aims The aim study determine Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) instrument patient sporadic inherited MTC early advance stage medullary thyroid cancer patient find helpful facilitate communication health problem clinician . The study attempt ascertain patient cohort 's symptom quality life well assess thyroid cancer specific questionnaire , general symptom questionnaire neuroendocrine tumour specific questionnaire . The study also ascertain clinician 's view quality life tool term ability highlight problem otherwise ascertain standard clinical review appointment along relationship quality life tool score , performance status disease burden . Trial Design Patients randomise complete four quality life questionnaires different sequence ask question questionnaire prefer final brief questionnaire . The questionnaire present participant random order counterbalance effect boredom habituation . A trained nurse researcher available assist completion questionnaire require . A small cohort study participant ( approx 10-15 ) undergo cognitive interview . This help test functionality survey question . The interview take format retrospective probe i.e . directed question undertaken member research team participant complete questionnaire . The aim identify problem cover questionnaire , problem terminology comprehension well assess ability participant successfully rank 4 quality life tool . Outcomes Primary outcome measure : Identification medullary thyroid cancer patient ' prefer quality life instrument describe concern facilitate communication health care professional . Assessed patient ' ranking questionnaire 1-4 ( 1 represent favoured tool ) . - Secondary Outcomes : - ass difference prefer quality life tool amongst sporadic inherited MTC patient - correlate quality life questionnaire score performance status , disease stage burden , calcitonin double time - ass clinician ' view quality life tool term ability highlight problem otherwise ascertain standard clinical review appointment Eligibility : 200 patient require - Patients 16 year old diagnosis medullary thyroid cancer ( inherit sporadic ) - Patients include time point diagnosis Exclusion Criteria : - Patients differentiate ( papillary follicular ) thyroid cancer anaplastic thyroid cancer lymphoma thyroid . - Patients sufficiently understand English language patient learn disability , standardise validated questionnaire English . Quality Life Questionnaires The study utilise generic quality life instrument well disease specific one . The generic instrument EORTC QLQ-C30 disease specific tool MD Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) thyroid module City Hope Quality Life Scale/THYROID ( amend ) ass thyroid cancer issue EORTC QLQ-GINET21 ass issue relevant neuroendocrine tumour . ) EORTC QLQ-C30 core quality life questionnaire design measure cancer patient ' physical , psychological social function . The questionnaire compose multi-item scale single item . It focus QoL consequence physical limitation clinical symptom . It generic measure , oppose one target specific disease . ii ) MD Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) thyroid module patient report outcome measure assess severity multiple symptom impact symptom daily function last 24 hour . The 1-10 point rating scale comprise 13 core item , 6 thyroid specific symptoms 5 psychosocial item . Completion measure simple take minute . iii ) The City Hope Quality Life Scale/THYROID ( amend ) Questions relate specific issue concern thyroid patient regard condition , treatment side effect . Items cover physical , psychological , social spiritual domain . It establish instrument specifically design use thyroid patient . The original tool use question relevant differentiated thyroid cancer treatment relevant MTC patient substitute question specific management MTC . These amendment therefore part validate tool believe important relevant study . iv ) EORTC QLQ-GINET21This report responsive tool assess quality life neuroendocrine tumour arise gastrointestinal tract , pancreas liver . A significant proportion patient advance medullary thyroid cancer experience gastrointestinal symptom relate hypercalcitoninaemia study opportunity ass QOL tool relevant helpful describe quality life concern MTC patient different form neuroendocrine tumour . Patients Preference After complete four questionnaire , patient ask answer additional brief question ass whether found particular questionnaire useful , well question regard questionnaire characteristic ( length , ease understand relevance health problem ) . There also free text area comment area patient may consider important cover questionnaire . After complete 4 questionnaire patient ask evaluate quality life tool final short series question rank QoL tool order , 1-4 , 1 QoL tool find helpful 4 QoL tool least helpful . Publication The result trial share clinical community via publication peer-reviewed journal presentation national/international meeting . Any publication presentation arise directly result project acknowledge contribute investigator funders . Study Support The QaLM protocol review member NCRI Thyroid Cancer Subgroup , Thyroid Cancer Support Group Wales , Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust AMEND . Widespread support express clinician patient representative alike date 16 lead UK thyroid cancer team express interest participating study . It anticipate QaLM study would eligible inclusion National Cancer Research Institute 's ( NCRI ) Thyroid Cancer Trial portfolio would facilitate multicentre participation recruitment require successful completion study . The study proposal present NCRI Thyroid Cancer Subgroup research meeting October 2014 lead UK clinician request number patient recruit increase 100 200 take account unique opportunity offer study patient group . Biochemical monitoring ( calcitonin CEA ) form routine part investigation follow patient medullary thyroid cancer know rate change biochemical marker predict likely survival . It know however association biochemical marker change quality life . This project would unique opportunity compare contrast issue face patient MTC arise part Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia MTC arise sporadically . In era new systemic therapy form oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug , potentially take long term , require frequent monitoring initiate significant potential toxicity , would beneficial try quantify compare problem cause disease cause systemic therapy . Quality life paramount investigator currently lack information burden disease treatment . This information could help commissioner appraise new therapy use alongside clinical cost effectiveness data .</detailed_description>
