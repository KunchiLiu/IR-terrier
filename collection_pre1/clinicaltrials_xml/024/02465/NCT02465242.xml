	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major cause morbidity mortality US . The CDC state 1.7 million people sustain traumatic brain injury year , death occur 52,000 injured patient . It also estimate 275,000 yearly require hospitalization . The cost TBI devastate society , 2010 economic cost estimate approximately $ 76.5 billion . 90 % cost involve fatal hospitalize brain injured patient . Furthermore , survivor traumatic brain injury high rate institutionalization , readmission , disability . The prediction prognosis severe TBI difficult problem physician . Prognosis evaluation acute phase care varies widely among physician care patient [ 3 ] . With prognosis often doubt , physicians difficulty lead family patient toward appropriate treatment often lead expensive test patient management . The Brain Trauma Foundation recommend several early indicator prognosis severe TBI , include age , hypotension , CT scan feature , Glasgow Outcome Scale score , pupillary diameter light reflex . Pupillary diameter light reflex extensively study , however accurate measurement prognostic factor perform due lack standardize measuring procedure . A new device validate measure pupil size reactivity use infrared pupillometry . This device also study create Neurological Pupil Index ( NPi ) measure pupillary reactivity . The NPi show correlate intracranial pressure reading , however study correlate pupillometer finding outcome measure TBI . This study prospectively evaluate pupillometer reading pupillary size reactivity ( NPi ) test hypothesis NPi realiable predictor 30-day outcome patient severe TBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Pupillary light reflex long use important prognostic parameter predict outcome follow severe TBI . Despite long history , pupillary assessment remain inexact science replete subjectivity high inter-rater variability . This highlight need reliable , standardized , accurate measuring procedure . The NeurOptics NPi-100 Pupillometer handheld portable infrared device allow objective measurement pupillary size reflex . This device utilize algorithm derive multiple measurement take automatically pupillometer generate NPi ( Neurological Pupil Index ) . This index allow clinician reliably quantify various aspect pupillary response logical , quantitative scale . Similar device demonstrate improvement inter- intra-observer reliability assessment pupillary response . Although pupillometry show reliable early indicator increase intracranial pressure , unclear result pupillometry NPi reliably predict functional outcome patient traumatic brain injury . STUDY OBJECTIVE This prospective study design determine pupillary reflex , measure pupillometry quantify NPi , reliable prognosticator functional outcome and/or mortality patient TBI . STUDY POPULATION The patient include study adult 18 year age old present emergency department ( ED ) traumatic brain injury intubate require mechanical ventilation . STUDY PROCEDURES All patient undergo initial pupillometry evaluation record NPi initial evaluation ED per standard evaluation trauma patient . Beyond , pupillometry reporting NPi perform every six ( 6 ) hour ( Q4 ) bedside nurse throughout patient 's stay TNCC . For long term follow-up phase , functional recovery [ determine Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Functional Assessment Measure ( FAM ) ] , Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) , Quality Life ( QoL ) among TBI survivor assess patient discharged hospital and/or rehabilitation facility . Functional recovery ( FIM + FAM ) assess discharge TNCC 30 , 60 , 90 day post-injury . ADL QoL assess 90 day post-injury . Vital status record discharge TNCC 90 day post-injury . POTENTIAL RISK All intervention usual practice/standard care within institution . There essentially risk patient due study . Because investigator maintain identifiable information long-term follow-up assessment , potential loss personal health information exist . To attenuate risk , identifiable information keep password-protected hospital computer lock office . POTENTIAL BENEFIT There little specific benefit individual subject study contribute advancement knowledge . A general benefit would demonstrate pupillometer reliable predictor functional outcome TBI . This would better aid physician prognosis evaluation acute phase care decide appropriate treatment patient .</detailed_description>
