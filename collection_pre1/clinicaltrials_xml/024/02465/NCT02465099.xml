	<brief_summary>The OSTEOVUE™ Spine Dissector new ultrasonic energy device , specifically design soft tissue removal vertebral surface . The aim present study compare blood loss multilevel PSF surgeries patient adolescent scoliosis ( idiopathic neuromuscular ) do ED UD . Blood loss estimate major intraoperative surgical Stage ( 1 2 ) postoperatively ( discharge ) . Additionally , study ass possible influence device use secondary perioperative outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Spinal Fusion With Two Energy Dissection Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective compare intraoperative blood loss surgery perform monopolar electrocautery ultrasonic energy ( primary mean soft tissue dissection ) patient diagnosed adolescent scoliosis undergo multilevel ( &gt; =6 ) posterior spinal fusion ( PSF ) . This prospective , multicenter , pair-matched comparison study carry two phase : Phase I Perioperative outcome variable ( primary secondary ) collect patient adolescent scoliosis , meeting study inclusion criterion , schedule undergo PSF use monopolar electrocautery metal Cobb elevator ( consider current standard ) soft tissue dissection removal vertebral surface . This group Electrocautery Dissection ( ED ) group . Phase II The outcome variable measure ED group Phase I subsequently collect group patient adolescent scoliosis , meeting study inclusion criterion schedule undergo PSF surgery . For study group , surgery perform Harmonic OSTEOVUE™ Spine Soft Tissue Dissector ( refer OSTEOVUE™ Dissector protocol ) metal Cobb elevator , primary mean soft tissue dissection removal vertebral surface . This group Ultrasonic Dissection ( UD ) group . Patients UD group recruit exist patient population PSF candidate participate site . Prior recruitment participant Phase II , Principal Investigator ( PI ) document training/in service use OSTEOVUE™ Dissector least 5 multilevel spine surgery case . The proportion neuromuscular versus idiopathic case recruit Phase II base proportion patient either condition recruit Phase I . Up five US site orthopedic surgeon and/or neurosurgeon , expertise pediatric PSF surgery , participate study . 100 subject enrol study ( 46 ED group 54 UD group ) . Propensity score match utilized match subject ED group subject UD group . Propensity score base variable know influence blood loss , full detail match methodology provide separate Statistical Analysis Plan .</detailed_description>
