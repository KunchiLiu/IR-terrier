	<brief_summary>Video capsule endoscopy important procedure use doctor find abnormality small intestine , especially cause bleeding . The procedure use tiny wireless camera take picture digestive tract . The camera sit inside vitamin-sized capsule person swallow . As capsule travel digestive tract , camera take thousand picture transmit recorder worn belt around person 's waist his/her shoulder . However , abnormality miss partly normal dark liquid present intestine prevent abnormality record , hide physician review video . The current method use clear dark liquid small intestine follow clear liquid diet drink approximately 2 quart polyethylene glycol ( Golytely® ) day video endoscopy take simethicone ( medication use treat symptom gas uncomfortable painful pressure , fullness , bloat ) morning test . Some current preparation clear dark liquid able entirely prevent abnormality miss unpleasant taste involve drinking lot fluid . Linaclotide ( Linzess® ) medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment constipation irritable bowel syndrome . It approve FDA use aid clearing dark liquid small intestine prior video endoscopy . A recent presentation medical meeting propose use one-dose linaclotide ( Linzess® ) improve cleanse small intestine capsule endoscopy preparation supplement fast clear liquid diet . This report claim noticeably well quality small intestine cleanse 20 % short transit time capsule take one dose linaclotide one hour patient swallow video capsule . The purpose study ass use one dose linaclotide term total time take capsule move small bowel , image quality compare current method . The result study compare previous patient drank preparation currently use</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-dose Linaclotide Capsule Endoscopy Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video capsule endoscopy important modality detection lesion small intestine . It particularly helpful patient occult source gastrointestinal bleeding , suspect Crohn 's disease , ulcerative jejunitis , case small intestinal neoplasm suspect . Despite advance technique equipment , significant limitation remain obtain adequate visualization due dark bilious fluid obscures mucosa . Furthermore , limitation battery technology mean approximately 16.5 % study capsule fail visualize entire small bowel . Numerous method bowel preparation use capsule endoscopy . To date , unpleasant/have significant side effect . This particularly onerous give majority already similar extensive preparation colonoscopy . Furthermore , overall efficacy vary , preparation frequently remain suboptimal . The University Virginia Health System Motility Lab use current regimen 2000 mL golytely simethicone , incomplete partially occluded portion small bowel remain persistent clinical issue . Nearly one five study may ultimately repeat result . A recent presentation Ira J. Schmelkin , M.D . propose use single-dose linaclotide capsule endoscopy preparation supplement fast clear liquid diet . In uncontrolled series , note clinically significant improvement preparation quality 20 % short transit time ( compare publish norm ) one high range dose linaclotide hour prior endoscopy . Linaclotide guanylate cyclase-C act luminal surface intestinal epithelium thereby stimulate secretion chloride bicarbonate intestinal lumen , result increase intestinal fluid increase motility . The increased motility secretion throughout gastrointestinal tract make potentially useful agent decrease capsule transit time decrease amount dark small intestine fluid , thereby improve capsule endoscopy yield . Initial report suggest linoclotide generally well tolerate , primary side effect diarrhea . The investigator propose study use single dose capsule endoscopy preparation . The hypothesis single-dose linaclotide lead significantly decrease transit time improve small bowel visualization quality compare control use polyethylene glycol simethicone ( standard care ) . The investigator propose prospectively enroll approximately 30 patient subject , receive single dose 290mcg one hour prior capsule endoscopy . This calculate use power calculation value Viazis study , note average transit time approximately 290 minute , compare approximately 190 minute data Schmelkin . Given standard deviation approximately 90 minute Viazis , power calculation alpha 0.05 beta 0.80 would require 18 subject per group . The investigator target 30 allow dropout allow use statistic pertain large ( approximately 30 ) number subject . All adult patient undergoing capsule endoscopy ( exception certain criterion , severe gastroparesis , pregnancy , non-English speaking , prisoner , unable give consent , prior small intestinal resection ) approach sequentially completion study . These match 1:1 historic control select random case prior three year . The exclusion criterion apply group . There two primary outcome : total transit time rat overall mucosal visualization ( categorized ideal , good , inadequate poor/needs repetition ) . Primary analysis presume confound use t-test chi-square , respectively . Should group prove significantly different , investigator also plan use adjust analysis . The investigator plan collect BMI , history reflux , age , sex , gastroparesis , diabetes , narcotic use , condition e.g . Parkinson 's , lupus , scleroderma may affect transit time historic control . Two gastrointestinal fellow attend level gastroenterologist perform score image record capsule endoscopy blind manner . Secondarily , investigator also look percentage capsule endoscopy detect culprit lesion , percentage fail ( incomplete ) study .</detailed_description>
