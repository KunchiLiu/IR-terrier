	<brief_title>Fat Reduction Flanks Area vs. Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , baseline blind control , comparison , clinical study show performance safety UltraShape treatment non-invasive fat reduction flank area compare improvement observe treated versus control flank . Up 60 Healthy subject 4 investigational site enrol study . All subject undergo assessment general health . During treatment period , subject 's fat thickness measure flank . Three successive bi-weekly ( two week interval ) UltraShape treatment perform one randomize flank , second flank treat serve control . The study subject undergo UltraShape treatments one flank use U-Sculpt /VDF Transducer , treat flank remain steady along study compare baseline control flank Three follow-up visit conduct follow : 4 week ( 4wk FU ) , 8 week ( 8wk FU ) 16 week ( 16wk FU ) post last treatment ( Tx.3 ) . Subject 's fat thickness measure flank measurement point use caliper visit ( treatment visit , prior treatment ) . Ultrasound measurement take visit , except second treatment visit , flank . Investigator satisfaction assess FU visit . In addition , subject questionnaire complete follow-up visit . Photographs front , right , leave back view flank perform visible light condition study visit .</detailed_description>
