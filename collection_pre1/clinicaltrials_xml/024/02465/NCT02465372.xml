AIM 2 : Determine acceptability/feasibility enhance PA coordinator train implementation Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program elementary school set . AIM 3 : Determine effectiveness train PA coordinator increase objectively measure PA elementary school youth . investigator randomize four school receive PA Coordinator training ( n=2 ) continue standard practice ( n=2 ) . A comprehensive process impact evaluation conduct determine acceptability intervention , factor influence implementation fidelity/dose , effectiveness PA Coordinators increase physical activity measure via accelerometry child .</detailed_description>
