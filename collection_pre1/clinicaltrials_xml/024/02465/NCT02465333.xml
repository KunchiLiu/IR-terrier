	<brief_summary>Plantar heel pain common problem foot . Plantar fasciitis lead cause pain , account 11-15 % foot symptom seek professional care , occur 10 % US population . The cause heel pain bone , soft tissue , nerve , systemic disease . The second common cause heel pain fat pad atrophy , follow combination fat pad atrophy plantar fasciitis . [ 1-4 ] Fat pad displacement may see heel well . Current treatment plantar fasciitis include stretch external support orthotics goal reduce local pressure well tissue breakdown . [ 5 ] However , patient compliance extrinsic device challenge , may experience increased friction , irritation breakdown different location foot due thickness device shoe . Also , patient must replace device soon break breakdown often go unnoticed . Failure conservative management may lead treatment steroid surgical intervention endoscopic plantar fasciotomy , open fasciotomy excision bone spur . Injection steroid instigate exacerbate pre-existing heel fat pad atrophy . Autologous fat graft heel may reduce plantar pressure , thus serve treatment heel pain . Autologous fat graft currently investigation myriad clinical scenario . [ 6-19 ] Even though autologous fat grafting yet establish therapeutic approach cite indication , report result intrigue . [ 19 ] The variable resorption fat , however , important confound factor study . Currently literature report fat retention rate range 25 % 80 % . [ 20 ] The specific aim study ass adipose stem cell characteristic patient undergo autologous fat graft heel fat pad atrophy correlate characteristic fat retention . Data study help determine characteristic adipose stem cell population open door additional study . This pilot study also help build new collaborative effort Foot Ankle Specialists , Plastic Surgery , Adipose Stem Cell Biologists , combine biomechanical expertise fat graft basic science expertise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With growth investigator diabetic geriatric population today , great demand place medical arena treat complication . There currently effective treatment diabetic neuropathy one lead reason development diabetic ulceration high peak plantar pressure . An optical pedobarograph use help study pressure foot . [ 24 ] By minimize high peak plantar pressure autologous fat transfer , pain skin lesion potential minimize . Restoring plantar fat pad autologous fat graft potential improve foot function , decrease foot pain , bone pain , nerve pain sensate foot potentially decrease incidence foot ulceration diabetic . It also serve increase shock absorption gait . Research show great viability cellular function fat graft process use Coleman technique technique . [ 25 ] It investigators aim implement Coleman technique increase pedal shock absorption long term basis . Increasing shock absorption prophylactic reduce calcaneal contusion stress fracture . By limit antalgic , compensatory gait , limit injury patient 's superstructure and/or contralateral foot leg , ultimately improve patient 's overall systemic health . By minimize high peak plantar pressure autologous fat transfer , severe diabetic complication may minimize . Heel fat pad augmentation may reduce ulcer formation and/or reformation , reduce subsequent comorbid condition osteomyelitis amputation . Typically , ulceration due bone prominence may best treated surgical resection prominent bone . However , exist population diabetic great chance develop acute Charcot event post-surgery transfer lesion ultimately break . Transfer lesion re-ulceration consider common complication diabetic foot ulcer surgery . [ 26 ] Also patient may medically stable make aggressive osseous surgical procedure inadvisable . If autologous fat graft prove effective foot , could become concomitant procedure perform osseous procedure target population diabetic limit transfer lesion ulceration post operatively . If propose aim achieve , patient able long lasting reconstruction heel fat pad minimally invasive procedure use autologous tissue . The ultimate cost maintain specialized extrinsic padding , shoe gear , issue patient compliance reduce eliminate . It could potentially save medical arena cost treat diabetic ulceration resultant complication . The need filler silicone migrate involve lymph node eliminate , need repeat injection temporary filler currently use without evidence-based medicine . This project improve scientific knowledge , technical capability , clinical practice field plastic surgery podiatry . Not influence field , augment heel fat pad potential benefit diabetic , geriatric patient , Wounded Warriors amputation differential load remain low extremity , athlete , cosmetic patient would like active lifestyle current foot pain allows . Determining intrinsic fat property lead consistent high fat retention rate enormous impact current clinical field fat graft . Over 80,000 autologous fat grafting procedure document 2013 The American Society Aesthetic Plastic Surgery . [ 27 ] Determining factor related fat retention aid surgeon determine potential amount fat may necessary optimize retention , potentially avoid need recurrent treatment . Further , data would also allow bioengineers specifically develop filler use constituent know importance final retention . This project increase scientific knowledge , technical capability , improve clinical collaboration Foot Ankle Specialists , Plastic Surgeons , Adipose Stem Cell Biologists .</detailed_description>
