	<brief_summary>A keystone prevent diabetic complication patient type 1 diabetes good glycaemic control . Frequent self-measurements blood glucose ( SMBG ) level essential part insulin dose meal . However , recent year continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) become treatment option inform patient glucose level may high low . In country , include Sweden , CGM reimburse combined continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) patient poor glycaemic control history repeat severe hypoglycaemia adult type 1 diabetes . This base exist clinical trial data show beneficial effect HbA1c CGM combine CSII . However , despite fact majority adult type 1 diabetes treat multiple daily insulin injection ( MDI ) , study effect CGM patient type 1 diabetes treat MDI sparse . Therefore , investigator initiate CGMMDI trial , ongoing , cross-over clinical trial include 161 MDI patient receive CGM 6 month , follow conventional therapy six month , four-month wash-out period in-between treatment . Evaluations include glycaemic control , hypoglycaemia , quality life , fear hypoglycaemia , treatment satisfaction , physical activity , safety . From research regulatory standpoint , long-term data treatment effect expect great extent today previous year , due various reason , e.g. , evaluate sustain beneficial effect time , long-term patient safety . Accordingly , follow-up treatment extension phase randomize diabetes trial become common time , especially many novel glucose-lowering treatment concern . Therefore , aim current study evaluate long-term effect CGM patient type 1 diabetes treat MDI . Patients consent extension phase 1 year CGMMDI trial receive CGM , evaluation perform sustained glycaemic control effect , hypoglycaemia , glycaemic variability , quality life , fear hypoglycaemia , treatment satisfaction , physical activity , safety .</brief_summary>
