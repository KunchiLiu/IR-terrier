	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Selective Blockade Saphenous Obturator Nerves Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A femoral nerve block recommend strategy many surgical center supplement multimodal analgesic regime follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) ( i.e . spinal general anesthesia ) . However , femoral nerve block often result quadriceps paralysis , increase risk patient fall long femoral block effect . Thus , search sensory nerve block stop pain TKA interesting topic . The saphenous nerve purely sensory nerve , posterior branch obturator nerve mixed nerve , motor component affect part adductor major muscle .</detailed_description>
