	<brief_summary>Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) increase worldwide frequency severity . It lead cause hospital acquire infection develop country associate least 14,000 death per year United States . With 3 million cases/ year , annual cost treat infection exceed 3 billion dollar . It also profound negative impact quality life . The investigator believe patient high risk relapse first CDI episode would benefit early fecal microbial transplant ( FMT ) . The propose study produce preliminary data regard safety efficacy potential cost effectiveness use early fecal transplant patient first episode non-refractory CDI predict high rate recurrence base previously publish risk factor . The investigator well prepared test efficacy approach future multicenter clinical trial randomize controlled fashion . The purpose study compare effectiveness safety early fecal transplant use donor stool healthy person group patient diagnose first episode Clostridium difficile infection predict high chance infection return similar group patient receive current standard care treatment C.difficile . The investigator hypothesize : - clinical remission rate 12 week note absence clinical symptom and/or negative C.difficile stool polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) great experimental arm compare control arm - patient experimental group low microbial diversity prior FMT exhibit high microbial diversity FMT resemble respective donor - microbial diversity diminish group time enrollment , experimental group exhibit high microbial diversity compare control population 12 week - patient group exhibit poor quality life time enrollment , however , experimental group demonstrate high quality life compare control group follow completion treatment - cost incurred experimental group less control group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment CDI remain challenging , especially recurrent disease . Failures rate 20-30 % initial treatment report , 65 % fail third course antibiotic . In addition , cost treatment , upward $ 3000 10 day course single antibiotic , may leave many patient family financially overburden . Use FMT show effective cure rate 80 % , safe even immunocompromised patient , cost effective recurrent ( 3 ) episode C.difficile . Emory University Emory Clinic perform 100 FMT 's since July 2012 treatment recurrent refractory CDI similar cure rate . Current treatment approach CDI limit use fecal transplant 2 recurrence least one failure 6-8 week taper vancomycin least 2 episode severe CDI result hospitalization refractory CDI define moderate CDI respond standard therapy least one week ( 5 ) . However , investigator feel attempt perform FMT early first episode high risk recurrence , decrease recurrence rate , improve quality life , low health care cost see . Patients participate randomize one two group - one group receive fecal transplant another group receive fecal transplant . A fecal transplant use sigmoidoscopy occur subject fecal transplant arm complete course antibiotic treatment C.difficile infection . Healthy stool donor infuse colon help replenish good bacteria patient C.difficile infection often . The group undergo FMT take antibiotic probiotic therapy management CDI part standard care .</detailed_description>
