	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treatment Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell ( DC ) involve activate , turning-on , body 's immune system . Your immune system help guard body germ , virus , threat . Although dendritic cell strong , number body high enough cause powerful immune response ; therefore , DC make laboratory cell collect individual 's blood . In study , make vaccine hope educate immune cell target pp65 antigen , type immune marker GBM , thus result call pp65 DC vaccine . Use vaccine activate immune system type immunotherapy . It hop give pp65 DC vaccine shot skin , immune system activate attack tumor cell brain leave normal cell alone . To see pp65 DC vaccine effective treatment GBM , subject assign different treatment group . Two group subject receive pp65 DC vaccine one group receive placebo .</detailed_description>
