Double-blind , placebo-controlled ( DBPCFC ) oral food challenge The DBPCFC perform outside episode exacerbation acute illness . Children admit allergy clinic two separate day , food challenge perform supervision experience allergist . A peripheral intravenous line insert patient start challenge , accord recommendations.Increasing dos cow 's milk administer 20 min apart .
