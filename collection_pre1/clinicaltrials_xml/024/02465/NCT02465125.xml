	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND - Vascular surgical patient often receive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion peri-operative period - RBC transfusion may lead improved outcome hand intervention may harmful - Danish Health Medicines Authority recommend transfusion RBC hemoglobin 5 mmol/L local clinical guideline recommend transfusion RBC maintain hemoglobin level 6 mmol/L - A large randomized clinical trial need evaluate efficacy safety RBC transfusion patient undergo vascular surgery . - A trial examine effect RBC transfusion tissue oxygenation use test trial-design feasibility trial evaluate post-operative mortality morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Transfusion Triggers Vascular Surgery Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN Single-center , randomize , open-label trial include vascular surgical patient peri-operative red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . If patient drop trial , either his/her request due withdrawal active therapy , patient follow intention-to-treat analysis . PROTOCOL SUSPENSION The patient temporarily suspend protocol follow circumstance , clinician charge find indication blood transfusion adhere plan transfusion threshold : - Uncontrollable bleeding , define loss surgical hemostasis result overt imminent hemodynamic instability insufficient tissue oxygenation increase lactate production OR - Hypotension unresponsive fluid replacement OR - Decompensated heart failure OR - Stroke , extremity- intestinal ischaemia SAMPLE SIZE With total 50 randomised patient , trial power - Show difference mean postoperative hemoglobin 1.0 mmol/L . With power 95 % , 5 % significance standard deviation 0.9 mmol/L . - Show difference 2 unit ( 600 mL ) RBC transfuse base standard deviation RBC transfusion volume 717 mL , power 80 % 5 % significance - Produce 97.5 % confidence interval ( CI ) equal sample adherence prevalence plus minus 8 % true prevalence adherence hypothesize 90 % - Detect difference near infrared spectroscopy-determined tissue oxygenation ( ScO2 ) 6 % surgery . With power 80 % , 5 % significance ScO2-standard deviation 7 % TIME-LINE The first patient expect randomize June 8th 2015 , last randomize March 31st 2016 trial database expect closed ultimo June 2016 . The main manuscript submit shortly thereafter . PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 1 . The Ethical Committee Region Zealand approve protocol amendment March 29th 2016 permission extend trial period end 2016 . 2 . On September 20th 2016 The Ethical Committee Region Zealand approve protocol amendment September 16th 2016 permission extend sample size 58 patient extend trial period June 31st 2017 . The 2nd amendment submit compensate unexpected high rate patient randomise postoperatively thus secure sufficient sample size ( n=44 ) primary outcome measure , postoperative Hb , secondary outcome measure NIRS ROTEM .</detailed_description>
