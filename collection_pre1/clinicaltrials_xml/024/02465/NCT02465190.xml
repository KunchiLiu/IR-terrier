	<brief_title>Effectiveness Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Maternal Vaccination Among Pregnant Women Their Newborns South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Investigators conduct vaccination campaign amongst pregnant woman different area South Africa monitor effectiveness programme . Investigators use unmatched case-control study design . Vaccination campaign conduct clinic active promotion influenza vaccination . Posters place clinic recommend influenza vaccination pregnant woman health education material provide . Vaccines administer clinic staff routine service vaccination recommend standard care . Dedicated study staff ( research assistant ) place clinic offering vaccination . These staff assist clinic staff management influenza vaccine supply documentation influenza vaccination status patient record . Vaccination status document mother 's antenatal record . Investigators visit facility area serve surveillance hospital conduct staff training facility baby deliver enter maternal influenza immunization status child 's vaccination card time administration birth dose polio vaccine . Identification enrolment case control estimation VE laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalised illness infant &lt; 6 month age overall HIV status Cases control identify active sentinel surveillance hospitalise medical illness diagnosis amongst child age &lt; 6 month . Hospitals surveillance conduct large hospital serve community antenatal TIV campaign conduct . Investigators conduct ongoing active surveillance consecutive patient selection require sample size reach . Identification enrolment case monitor adverse event Dedicated study staff conduct information session woman select enrolment . These woman ask write informed consent prior participation non-participation affect woman 's eligibility receive vaccine . Following vaccination administer nurse , per Department Health schedule , demographic information , medical history , obstetric history contact detail collect participant structure interview . Immediate reaction vaccine record time interview . A separate aide de memoire diary give participant . This diary assist woman record symptom experience seven day follow vaccination . The symptom list base standard collection tool . Data collection Hospitalised child &lt; 6 month For hospitalised child &lt; 6 month age , epidemiologic data collect parent caregiver interview , possible , well review medical vaccination record mother ( antenatal card , maternal in-patient card antenatal clinic register ) baby ( Road-to-Health card clinic register ) . Information gather include : demographic mother baby ( age , sex , race ) , medical history baby ( premature birth , congenital illness congenital heart lung disease , immunosuppressive chronic illness ) , recent infection , recent antimicrobial use , household characteristic ( residence type number room , number person age , question relate socioeconomic status , exposure tobacco smoke indoor air pollution ) , child-care centre attendance , breast feeding vaccination history . It also request educational level parent guardian adult child household receive pneumococcal influenza vaccine . Information HIV status include whether mother test HIV pregnancy HIV status test , whether patient previously test HIV result test , history underlie illness previous HIV-associated diagnosis . Nutritional status child evaluate measure weight ( kilogram ) length ( centimetre ) time admission . If parent guardian write vaccination record case control child , names , batch number date vaccine record ( see determination vaccination status ) . For issue may change time ( e.g . exposure cigarette smoke , breastfeeding , day-care attendance ) , question focus 4 week ( 30 31 day ) illness . Adverse birth outcome For effectiveness adverse birth outcome ( prematurity , LBW SGA ) epidemiologic data primarily collect birth record maternal antenatal record . Information gather include : demographic mother baby ( age ( mother ) , sex , race ) , household characteristic ( residence type number room , number person age , question relate socioeconomic status . It also request educational level parent guardian . Information HIV status include whether mother test HIV pregnancy HIV status test . The baby 's birthweight gestational age evaluate delivery antenatal record . Birthweight ( kilogram ) length ( centimetre ) document . Hospitalised pregnant woman postpartum woman , â‰¥18 year Epidemiologic , clinical presentation , laboratory data well information hospital course collect enrolled patient . A case investigation form complete structured interview . Information gather include : demographic ( age , sex , race ) , present symptom , medical history ( lung disease , immunosuppressive chronic illness include cardiac disease , chronic renal disease , diabetes mellitus similar metabolic disorder ) , previous hospital admission , recent infection , recent antimicrobial use , household characteristic ( residence type number room , number person age , question relate socioeconomic status , exposure tobacco smoke indoor air pollution ) data current previous influenza vaccination . Information HIV status include current HIV status whether patient previously test HIV result test , previous HIV-associated diagnosis , HIV stag . Obesity evaluate measure weight ( kilogram ) length ( centimetre ) time admission . Medical record review inpatient management ( antimicrobial use , influenza antiviral therapy result investigation conduct ) outcome ( admission ICU , discharge die ) . Monitoring adverse event The diary take home participant . Telephone contact make participant study staff member day eight ( day 7 , 9 10 day 8 fall weekend ) content diary recover telephonically . If study staff able contact participant first attempt , three document attempt make contact patient . Participants also request return diary next clinic visit . Participating woman ask contact study team hospitalize reason seven day post-vaccination . A member study team visit woman hospital , use predesigned form , collect data reason hospitalization . Logs record enrol patient contact detail keep site . Completed data collection form return data centre NICD data capture storage .</detailed_description>
