	<detailed_description>The following research question investigate : 1 . Do particular development syntax recursion comprehension affect particular kind think second-order Theory Mind reason autistic child ? More concretely : Does child 's ability comprehend linguistic structure involve consist recursive structure predict performance second-order false-belief test , beyond development general language ability ? 2 . Does knowledge dialogue particle predict performance second-order false-belief test , beyond development language ability work memory ? In order investigate question , between-subjects empirical design include data collection data analysis two step : one measuring strength correlation variable , establish causality effect via training . The study divide four stage : pilot , pre-testing , intervention , post-testing . 1 . The central goal pilot test ensure reliability task Danish : vocabulary familiarity child understand ask . Second-order false-belief task recursion task give child pilot stage . 2 . Pre-testing stage stage variable measure ( dependent , independent confounding ) . Selection pretests reflect consideration confound variable inclusion criterion . Confounding variable include : verbal comprehension ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children IV ) , work memory ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children IV ) , comprehension grammar syntactic structure ( Clinical Evaluation Language Fundamentals-4 ) , pragmatic profile ( Clinical Evaluation Language Fundamentals-4 ) . Independent variable include above-mentioned linguistic test . Dependent variable second-order false-belief test . 3 . At intervention stage train recursion comprehension randomize half sample size provide four individual sessions,15 minute . Training recursion comprehension include cooperative dialogue feedback sentence small dialogue analogous task pretests . 4 . After train complete , sample subject give second-order false-belief recursion task post-testing stage . The goal recruit 60 subject total . For train part 30 subject assign randomization intervention group 30 subjects- control group . The recruiting process participation require disclosure personal data . Parental inform , write consent child take part study prerequisite every child 's participation . Parents also receive debrief information write form upon completion empirical part study . Participants ensure full anonymity . All data anonymized use subject 's identification , name . All personal record kind , include video tape recording test , keep accord Danish Privacy Law regulation . Every child test individually trained psychologist quiet comfortable room away classroom . In case test procedure way unpleasant excessively demand participant , session cancel , finish earlier number task revise .</detailed_description>
