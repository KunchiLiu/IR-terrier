	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well treatment direct genetic testing work patient solid tumor lymphomas progress follow least one line standard treatment agree upon treatment approach exist . Genetic test look unique genetic material ( gene ) patient ' tumor cell . Patients genetic abnormality ( mutation , amplification , translocation ) may benefit treatment target tumor 's particular genetic abnormality . Identifying genetic abnormality first may help doctor plan good treatment patient solid tumor , lymphoma , multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NCI-MATCH : Targeted Therapy Directed Genetic Testing Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors , Lymphomas , Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proportion patient objective response ( OR ) target study agent ( ) patient advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proportion patient alive progression free 6 month treatment target study agent patient advance refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma . II . To evaluate time death disease progression . III . To identify potential predictive biomarkers beyond genomic alteration treatment assign resistance mechanism use additional genomic , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , protein imaging-based assessment platform . IV . To assess whether radiomic phenotype obtain pre-treatment imaging change pre- post-therapy imaging predict objective response progression free survival evaluate association pre-treatment radiomic phenotype target gene mutation pattern tumor biopsy specimen . OUTLINE : STEP 0 ( Screening ) : Patients undergo biopsy along molecular characterization biopsy material specific , pre-defined mutation , amplification , translocation interest via tumor sequence immunohistochemistry . Consenting patient also undergo collection blood sample research purpose . STEPS 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ( Treatment ) : Patients assign 1 30 treatment subprotocols base molecularly-defined subgroup . ( See Arms Section ) STEPS 2 , 4 , 6 ( Screening ) : Patients experience disease progression prior Step treatment could tolerate assign treatment undergo review previous biopsy result determine another treatment available undergo another biopsy . Patients may maximum 2 screen biopsy 2 treatment per biopsy . STEP 8 ( Optional Research ) : Consenting patient undergo end-of-treatment biopsy collection blood sample research purpose . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
