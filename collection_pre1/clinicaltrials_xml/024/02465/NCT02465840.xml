	<brief_summary>Hand injury one common occupational traumatic injury outpatient clinic rehabilitation department . The motor sensory deficit hand trauma include bony fracture , tendon / nerve injury , joint stiffness , motion restriction , sensory impairment , pain lead impaired upper extremity function , ability daily activity , quality life . Rehabilitation kind therapy disability hand trauma . It could provide pain control , improvement joint motion , stiffness reduction , prevent secondary trauma . The investigator consider deficit hand function range motion , pain injury , attenuation brain functional MRI ( fMRI ) hand motor control . Therefore , optimal early intervention rehabilitation program may benefit hand functional outcome improve brain activity fMRI image hand motor control . The aim study compare difference hand motor control area brain functional MRI ( fMRI ) normal subject hand injury patient treatment investigate improvement brain fMRI activity functional outcome early rehabilitation hand injury patient . The investigator collect 40 patient hand trauma operation 10 normal subject study . The 10 normal subject allocate control group . These 40 patient randomly divide 2 experimental group : 20 patient group A 20 patient group B . In group A B , patient perform immobilization Kleinert program respectively . All patient perform rehabilitation regimen 2-3 session per week 3-6 month . Before rehabilitation , patient receive physical examination , brain fMRI , DASH questionnaire daily activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation regimen noninvasive therapy hand injure patient operation . Protected active/passive motion mostly use method . Rehabilitation therapy could provide pain control , improvement joint motion , stiffness reduction , prevent secondary trauma . The investigator collect 40 patient hand trauma operation 10 normal subject study . These 40 patient divide 2 experimental group : 20 patient group A ( immobilization program ) 20 patient group B ( Kleinert program ) . A.The immobilization program 0-4 week : dorsal prospective splint wrist MCP joint flexion IP joint full extension . 3-4 week : Hourly : 10 repetition passive digital flexion extension wrist 10ï¾Ÿextension . Hourly : 10 repetition active tendon gliding exercise . 4-6 week : dorsal block splint discontinue . Gentle block exercise initiate 10 repetition , 4-6 time daily add passive flexion tendon glide . 6-8 week : gentle resistive exercise progress gradually . B.The Kleinert program 0-3 day : dorsal protective splint apply wrist MCP joint flexion IP joint full extension ; elastic traction fingernail , palmar pulley , volar forearm . Velcro strap allow night release elastic traction , splint IPs full extension . 0-4 week : hourly active extension limit splint , follow flexion elastic traction . Wound scar management education . 4-6 week : dorsal protective splint discontinue , sometimes replaced wrist cuff elastic traction . Night protective splint prevent flexion contracture . Active wrist gentle active fisting initiate unless sign minimal adhesion . At 6 week block exercise begin . 6-8 week : progressive resistive exercise begin . The investigator perform physical examination , brain fMRI , QuickDASH questionnaire patient program , 3 6 month later . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) also perform normal participant . All patient perform rehabilitation 2-3 session per week . The investigator perform physical examination , brain fMRI , QuickDASH questionnaire patient program , 3 6 month later . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) also perform normal participant .</detailed_description>
