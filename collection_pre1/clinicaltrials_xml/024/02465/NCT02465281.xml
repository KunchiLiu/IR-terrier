	<brief_summary>The objective preliminary study : 1. identify correlation brain lesion sensorimotor impairment stroke . 2. identify potential effect time correlation brain lesion sensorimotor impairment compare result patient sub-acute stroke versus patient chronic stroke . 3. identify possible pattern brain lesion sensorimotor impairment might increase understand stroke recovery guide tailor-based neuro-rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate arm hand function stroke location brain lesion affect arm hand function . We hop collect data form assessment feel arm move , survey activity daily life well-being , perform 1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan . MRI scan loud painless ; nothing inject . With MRI , collect image brain .</detailed_description>
