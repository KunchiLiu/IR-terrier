	<brief_title>UltraShape Device Using U-Sculpt/VDF Transducer Flanks Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , baseline blind control , one arm clinical study show performance safety UltraShape treatment non-invasive fat circumference reduction flank area . Up 60 Healthy subject 4 investigational site enrol study . All subject undergo assessment general health . During treatment period , subject 's circumference fat thickness measure three successive bi-weekly ( two week interval ) UltraShape treatment perform . The study subject undergo UltraShape treatment flank area use U-Sculpt /VDF Transducer . During follow-up period visit conduct follow : 4 week ( 4wk FU ) , 8 week ( 8wk FU ) 16 week ( 16wk FU ) post last treatment ( Tx.3 ) . Subject 's circumference measure measurement point accord flank treat area , circumference reduction assess visit . Additionally , subject questionnaire complete follow-up visit . Finally , photography perform visible light condition front , right , leave back view . Most assessment occur visit clinic .</detailed_description>
