	<detailed_description>FXS common inherit form intellectual disability ( ID ) . The typical male IQ 50 55 , involvement range mild severe . Females generally less affected broad range function . Some severe ID adaptive impairment , normal borderline intellectual ability . This wide range cognitive skill lead variable ability make choice live independently . Most research individual FXS noninvasive , limited parent survey psychological assessment . Studies evoke major ethical concern , consent process typically involve straightforward parental consent . Some study draw blood , collect saliva , measure heart rate , use neuroimaging , recently paucity treatment research . This scenario change dramatically past several year . Advances understand molecular basis FXS lead new generation treatment , clinical trial way use variety compound . The possibility side effect potential significant change behavior ability elevate new level importance obtain meaningful consent , parent , also individual FXS . Researchers Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) member need data guide decision involve individual FXS consent process . Unfortunately , little known extent individual FXS involve decision research participation . This project ass range decisional capacity FXS , identify factor associate individual difference decisional capacity , validate rating scale categorize decisional capacity , develop novel tablet-based decision aid technology assist researcher clinician maximize decisional capacity consent . This study work toward achieve two overarch aim : 1 ) Characterize explain individual difference decisional capacity FXS , 2 ) Design evaluate effect tablet-based decision aid participation consent process hypothetical clinical trial . Ultimately , study provide important information nature decisional capacity FXS validate novel intervention maximize successful participation consent process .</detailed_description>
