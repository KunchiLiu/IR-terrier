	<brief_summary>Current therapy autism target social language behavior , due high-level nature skill improvement rarely extend beyond target behavior . This project use new technology implement novel concept behavioral intervention improve basic attention eye movement skill ASD . Because basic skill form foundation good social communication , train ability potential improve broad spectrum clinical symptom , young child may affect course development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) lifelong disorder severely affect ability learn function social environment . In typical function , high level social , language communication skill develop first year life depend upon critical building block sensory-motor attention ability . Similarly autism , high level problem social communication develop first two post-natal year precede subtle abnormal visual attention motor skill . Trainings improve social interaction communication common behavioral intervention ASD . These therapy may improve specific behavior target train , rarely generalize broad function clinical symptom . The investigator propose intervention aim instead early deficit support social language skill would broadly effective . Because disruption attention one early persistent symptom autism , attention highly subject improvement training , important target intervention . This novel intervention train speed accuracy attention orient eye movement . The training design target attentional behavior show impaired autism , include attention orienting , disengagement shifting , restrict attentional field . Because eye movement attention tightly link , eye movement deficit ASD parallel find spatial attention . Eye movement provide marker attention propose training design improve speed , accuracy flexibility eye movement attention simultaneously . Training uses series entertain video game gradually shape behavior use visual auditory feedback provide real time . The investigator plan three level outcome measure pre- post-training test effectiveness intervention ( direct test attention eye movement ; test improvement attentional visual monitoring speed accuracy response simulate environment ; test behavior actual social environment ) . The investigator conduct clinical trial control condition ( e.g. , standard video game without train element ) small sample ASD child age 9-15 . If initial work successful , long term goal develop readily available inexpensive eyetracker-based system home use suitable broad age range ASD child adult .</detailed_description>
