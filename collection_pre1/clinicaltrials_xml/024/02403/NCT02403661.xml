	<brief_summary>The primary goal study quantify functional deficit cause injury brachial plexus peripheral nerve arm . The second goal test possible benefit electrical stimulation injure nerve follow surgery . The investigator test whether electrical stimulation improve hand function nerve regeneration repair nerve injury . Injuries cause nerve damage arm hand common . In severe case , functional outcome even surgery remain poor . Recently , electrical stimulation apply injured nerve rat . This show improve nerve regeneration . These study show little one hour electrical stimulation effective . Therefore , investigator plan test new method treatment determine whether also helpful human . These do use symptom severity questionnaire , nerve conduction study test pressure sensation , hand dexterity strength . The patient randomize either treatment control group . Following treatment , baseline measurement reevaluate every three month first year every 6 month second year . The timing nature evaluation process identical group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Enhance Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Surgical repair nerve graft currently standard treatment nerve laceration . However , even , functional outcome patient proximal nerve cut often poor . In case , survive axon proximal nerve stump already reach capacity limit sprout reinnervate . Therefore , reinnervation occur even surgery unless regeneration extension proximal stump somehow enhance . Unfortunately , although many attempt , none show effective clinical setting . Post-surgical electrical stimulation : Recent study demonstrate electrical stimulation apply directly injured peripheral nerve result marked improvement nerve regeneration . Preliminary data suggest electrical nerve stimulation could possibly enhance nerve regeneration fact know time . Accelerated rate regeneration find animal receive electrical stimulation little 1 hour . Furthermore , preferential growth regenerate sensory axon appropriate nerve branch also accelerate electrical stimulation . Since study show little one hour electrical stimulation effective accelerate nerve regeneration , open possibility apply human . The intervention safe minimal discomfort . Furthermore , use electrical stimulation clinical treatment modality already well accept . In recent study , investigator apply patient severe median nerve compressive injury carpal tunnel follow surgery . The procedure well tolerated adverse event observe 21 subject 1 year follow . In fact , compare control subject receive surgery alone , treatment group show quick resolution symptom vigorous motor nerve regeneration . The problem prolong denervation : Prognosis follow severe trauma nerve upper arm forearm , leave untreated , extremely poor . Current conventional treatment primary nerve repair insert nerve graft ( commonly use sural nerve ) restore nerve continuity . However , even , extent reinnervation often far complete . The glacial rate nerve regeneration , 1 mm day , easily leave target intrinsic hand muscle deprive nerve innervation year . The long period denervation , couple lack active movement lead whole host negative consequence include muscle fibre fibrosis , contracture , secondary joint derangement infrequently , pain . Equally important Schwann cell ' ability support trophic support nerve growth guidance also gradually decline . Therefore , effective treatment urgently need . A recent approach distal nerve transfer . That shorten distance reinnervation greatly . However , outcome follow transfer primary suture repair follow acute median ulnar nerve laceration relatively poor . Another closely related common trauma hand laceration digital nerve recovery sensory function follow primary nerve suture equally poor . To potentially expedite reinnervation , investigator propose additionally stimulate proximal nerve stump immediately follow nerve transfer and/or nerve repair . Whether novel approach indeed expedite reinnervation improve hand function follow nerve laceration know point . This first human application study address question . Hypothesis/Research Question/Objectives : Investigators hypothesize nerve regeneration nerve arm digital nerve hand significantly enhance combined post-surgical electrical stimulation . Furthermore , improve nerve regeneration post-operative electrical stimulation result significant improvement hand function compare surgery alone.To test hypothesis , objective study : 1 ) quantify functional physiological consequence severe nerve injury arm , 2 ) compare outcome conventional nerve surgery alone versus nerve surgery follow post-operative electrical stimulation . Basic Study Design : Subjects Patients severe trauma nerve upper limb result complete axonal loss recruit . These patient randomly assign either nerve repair/transfer alone nerve repair/transfer follow one hour low frequency electrical stimulation . The patient follow 3 month interval 2 year . Post-surgical outcome include electrophysiological evaluation do independent physician part investigation team . Therefore , tester aware whether subject conventional surgery group surgery+electrical stimulation group . Interventions Once baseline study complete , subject randomize one two group : ) Surgery follow sham stimulation 5 second . Nerve repair/transfer surgery perform peripheral nerve surgeon . ii ) Surgery follow 1 hour electrical stimulation . Electrical stimulation do insert pair fine wire insulate around except distal 1 cm tip incision site . Tips fine wire seat proximal nerve stump depolarize axon . These fine wire electrode connect portable electrical stimulator ( model SD9 , Grass Instruments , Providence , RI , USA ) . Continuous 20 Hz electrical stimulus deliver intensity 1.5 time motor threshold hour . At low intensity , little discomfort stimulation procedure . In previous series carpal tunnel syndrome patient carry University Alberta , find totally safe well tolerate . The fine wire remove stimulation protocol complete . Methods outcome evaluation 1 . Sensory nerve conduction study measure sensory nerve action potential amplitude . 2 . Motor nerve conduction study measure compound muscle action potential amplitude . 3 . Motor unit number estimate . The 'multiple point stimulation ' technique use . 4 . Light touch pressure sensation . This test use Semmes-Weinstein Monofilaments McKinnon-Dellon Disk-Criminator . 5 . Hand function test . This test use Moberg Pick-Up Test , Purdue Pegboard Test , Jamar dynamometer grip strength , Pinch dynamometer key , tripod tip-to-tip strength . Post intervention evaluation : Following intervention , baseline parameter reevaluate every 3 6 month 2 year . The timing nature evaluation procedure identical patient . Statistical Considerations study design Since first human application study nerve laceration novel technique , result valuable guiding future full scale study . The rationale propose total 80 subject study base recently complete study use post surgical electrical stimulation enhance nerve regeneration patient carpal tunnel syndrome . In randomize controlled study , similar sample size use investigator find significant improvement nerve regeneration treatment group compare control . Based motor unit number estimation , primary outcome use , treatment group show statistically significant improvement compare control group . Data Analysis : Statistical analysis change outcome measure parameter within subject do use paired t-test . A p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Differences treatment outcome two group do use independent t-test treatment method independent variable .</detailed_description>
