	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system ( CNS ) , ultimately lead myelin damage axonal loss . The disease complex multifactorial , key pathogenic event appear uncontrolled response component immune system ( T B lymphocytes ) myelin protein . No definitive treatment available MS , however immunomodulatory immunosuppressant drug act disease-modifying agent ( DMDs ) . Unfortunately , current treatment demonstrate partial efficacy target deleterious immune reaction . According present knowledge pathophysiology MS , ideal therapeutic strategy would modulate suppress aggressive immune process , protect axon neuron degeneration , enhance repair facilitate remyelination . A specific form stem cell , call adult mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , show remarkable ability modulate immune response . This study evaluate safety inject MSCs people MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MSCs remarkable ability modulate immune response mainly inhibit proliferation T cell protect injured tissue paracrine mechanism . There urgent need evaluate real efficacy MSC transplantation , possible position current therapeutic armamentarium . An international panel MS neurology stem cell expert , well immunologists form `` International Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation '' ( MSCT ) Study Group aim derive consensus cell use transplantation develop treatment protocol experimental program eventually attest efficacy MSC transplantation understand mechanism underlie benefit . 12 patient MS treat IV injection autologous isolate expanded mesenchymal stem cell . Clinical objective evaluation perform baseline 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
