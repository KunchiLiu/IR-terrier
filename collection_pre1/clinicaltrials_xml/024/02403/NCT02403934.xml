	<brief_summary>Maintaining patent airway constant concern anesthesia provider perform deep sedation case . The dos sedative medication often require desire level sedation patient often result occlusion airway patient become apneic . Opening collapse occlude airway require use invasive airway device , ( e.g . laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) , oral airway nasal airway ) application jaw thrust maneuver . When provider provide jaw thrust attend duty , patient may adequate ventilation patient 's oxygen saturation fall produce hypoxemia . Airway management device currently available require deep level sedation tolerate patient . In order avoid need internal airway device , provider attempt carefully adjust level sedation airway support require . For safety , provider usually try stay `` light '' side sedation scale . Unfortunately , often result uncomfortable patient one move much successfully carry procedure . Until availability Jaw Elevation Device ( JED ) external device provider could utilize assist open patient 's airway . By duplicate jaw thrust maneuver , JED maintain patent airway . Once apply , free anesthesia provider attend duty associate administration anesthesia without require provider manually maintain jaw thrust maneuver . The advantages device would allow level sedation deep enough patient tolerate procedure well maintain patent airway . To date , study evaluate JED clinical practice . The investigator wish evaluate JED standardized fashion deep sedation monitor anesthesia care ( MAC ) . Our study would involve 50 patient become apneic deep sedation MAC . A jaw thrust maneuver initially perform demonstrate patient 's airway adequately support maneuver . The JED place order maintain patent airway , leave level sedation unchanged . Intraoperative monitoring , continuous ECG , pulse oximetry , blood pressure , capnography , routine , determine anesthesia team . The investigator also track often provider require adjust JED maintain patent airway , need convert alternate method airway management require . The investigator pursue publication result first study demonstrate efficacy JED .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Jaw Elevation Device Deep Sedation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . General Approach : 50 Research subject select patient schedule undergo transvaginal oocyte ( egg ) retrieval sedation MAC . Sedation procedures typically consist intravenous administration combination midazolam , fentanyl , propofol , and/or ketamine titrate patient calm , supplemental oxygen provide mask nasal cannula . A continuous infusion propofol begin keep patient sedate enough lie still breathe regularly , still respond command noxious stimulus ( sternal rub ) . As per standard anesthetic care , patient oxygen saturation , end-tidal carbon dioxide waveform heart rate/rhythm measure continuously anesthesia care provider monitor patient sign inadequate respiration airway obstruction . These sign include loss end-tidal carbon dioxide waveform , snore , paradoxical ventilation , cessation ventilatory effort , reduction oxygen saturation . Typically , whenever sign present , anesthesia provider provide jaw thrust open patient 's airway restore adequate ventilation . Once accomplished , anesthesia care provider typically lower dose anesthetic release jaw thrust . If sign airway obstruction recur , jaw thrust apply level sedation reach level low enough patient breathe without airway support . However , may lead inadequate sedation , patient movement difficulty surgeon perform procedure . The depth sedation require egg retrieval procedure frequently result need perform jaw thrust place airway device maintain airway patency . Applying JED jaw thrust may alleviate airway obstruction allow adequate sedation maintain without compromise anesthetic depth . 2 . Description : Prior anesthesia , subject give supplemental oxygen monitor pulse oximetry , end tidal carbon dioxide ( ETCO2 ) capnography , noninvasive blood pressure , heart rate rhythm measurement . In study , patient sedate inadequate ventilation identify state , jaw thrust maneuver apply . If maintains adequate ventilation JED place patient adjust produce simulated jaw thrust effort open obstructive airway . Once JED appropriately place clinical sign ventilation achieve , investigator document number time anesthesia provider must manipulate JED device achieve adequate airway . If time anesthesia care provider feel JED adjust successfully maintain airway , use JED discontinue anesthesia provider employ airway management technique choice . In addition , time initial placement JED end JED use record obtain total time JED use anesthetic . The number adjustment per unit time JED use calculate compare constant jaw thrust would otherwise require . The duration anesthesia administration also collect begin induction anesthesia/sedation cessation infusion . The study continue 50 patient enter study . Information collect even patient require jaw thrust JED place . Due high frequency require airway assistance egg retrieval procedure perform deep sedation , incidence patient require assistance likely low 50 patient felt adequate study size describe utility efficacy JED setting . 3 Methods : One list investigator observe anesthetic collect observe data list attached data collection sheet . Data collect include following : Data point Method measurement Date procedure day/month/year ( DD/MM/YYYY ) Patient gender Population female ASA class 1-6 Age In year Height inch Weight kilogram BMI Kg/m2 Patient ethnicity How patient identifies Patient history obstructive sleep apne ( OSA ) Asked pre-operatively STOP-BANG score Asked pre-operatively Patient diagnosis Infertility Duration anesthetic medication administration Minutes : second Medication use Name medication Medication dose Mg , mcg Medication infusion rate Mcg/kg/min Time initiation sedation first airway obstruction Minutes : second Obstruction relieve jaw thrust Yes/No Success JED placement Return patent airway Time JED placement next airway manipulation , Minutes : second Number airway manipulation require JED placement count Frequency hypoxemia arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) &lt; 90 % Duration hypoxemia Minutes : second Complications List complication Conversion GA Yes/No Method GA List method Other airway device use List device 4 . Investigational Drugs/Devices/Biologics Research : Jaw Elevation Device ( JED ) . The FDA determine JED Class 1 device thus exempt 510 K. 5 . Research Material Collected : A data collection form fill anesthesia provider return investigator . Information include detail anesthetic technique use , performance JED . 6 . Protection Patient Privacy : All document relate individual 's participation study keep locked storage . Access record limit PI AI 's . Computer file contain collect study data store password protect file system . Identifying information record separate form link data collection form number system , deidentifying data . Data transcribe secure electronic file use data analysis . Once data analysis complete data collection sheet destroy shred . 7 . Risks : This study confer additional risk patient observational study use JED market application . All patient study receive treatment . There associated risk receive deep sedation . These include limited : airway obstruction , need use type airway device include endotracheal tube , sore throat , nausea vomiting , aspiration , serious , rare , complication ( cardiovascular pulmonary complication ) . However , risk inherent administration sedation procedure . You would risk whether participated study . 8 . Radiation Laser Exposure : None 9 . Justification Risks : The JED offer potential advantage increase range patient could safely tolerate deep sedation MAC . By complete study hope begin characterization population benefit use JED deep sedation MAC . 10 . Minimization Risks : By provide systematic approach patient selection data collection hope gain maximum utility study . By perform study observational fashion allow anesthesia provider retain full control anesthetic management , essentially alteration standard care , virtually additional clinical risk . Risk exposure PHI minimize method discuss .</detailed_description>
