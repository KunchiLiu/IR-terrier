	<criteria>The patient require reconstruction disc C3 C7 follow discectomy 1 2 ( contiguous ) level intractable radiculopathy ( arm pain and/or neurological deficit ) without neck pain , myelopathy due abnormality localize level disc space least one follow condition confirm radiographic imaging ( CT , MRI , Xrays ) : herniated nucleus pulposus , spondylosis ( define presence osteophyte ) , and/or visible loss disc height compare adjacent level . The patient fail least 6 week nonoperative treatment demonstrate progressive sign symptom despite nonoperative treatment prior implantation . Selfreports preoperative upper extremity ( right left ) VAS pain score ≥ 20 ( 0100 ) . Selfreports preoperative NDI score ≥ 30 % ( raw score ≥ 15/50 ) . Willing able comply protocol requirement include followup visit schedule . Willing able sign study specific informed consent . More two cervical level require surgery , two level require surgery adjacent . Previous surgical intervention target level ( ) Any follow target level ( ) : Significant cervical anatomical deformity , e.g. , ankylose spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis , etc . Moderate advance spondylosis . Patients demonstrate advanced degenerative change characterize following : bridging osteophyte , mark reduction absence motion ( &lt; 2 degree change flexion extension ) , collapse intervertebral disc space great 50 % normal height ( compare adjacent level ) Radiographic sign subluxation &gt; 3.5 mm Angulation disc space 11 degree great adjacent segment Significant kyphotic deformity ( &gt; 5 degree ) single level significant reversal lordosis ( correct extension ) Fused level adjacent level treat Axial neck pain patient 's solitary symptom Severe pathology facet joint involve vertebral body Previous diagnosis osteopenia osteomalacia Has follow risk factor may associate diagnosis osteoporosis .
