	<brief_summary>Heart disease major cause ill-health death adult . The risk factor heart disease , present child , carry adult life . Childhood obesity reach epidemic proportion Canada associate many heart disease risk factor high blood pressure . Another complication obesity obstructive sleep apnea . Sleep apnea mark snore night , pause breathe low oxygen level occur 60 % obese child , diagnose less 20 % obese child . Importantly , sleep apnea child , like obesity , link high blood pressure heart disease . Thus , child sleep apnea obese likely increase risk high blood pressure heart disease . Currently , little knowledge extent heart disease obese child sleep apnea . The best treatment obesity sleep apnea weight loss . Weight loss strategy generally successful since 75 % obese child become obese adult , urgent treatment need reduce heart disease long-term . Treating sleep apnea obese child may one way reduce heart disease . Sleep apnea treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , involve wear mask attach breathe machine asleep . It unknown effective CPAP reduce heart disease obese child . The investigator recruit child sleep apnea obese test heart disease risk . The investigator treat child CPAP . After 6 month CPAP , investigator repeat test determine CPAP lower risk heart disease . At end 6 month , receive CPAP randomize either continue CPAP discontinue CPAP 2 week period . At end 2 week period participant repeat test determine magnitude effect CPAP . The investigator expect CPAP treatment sleep apnea obese child reduce blood pressure lower heart disease . These result increase awareness danger sleep apnea obese child , facilitate early diagnosis treatment , ultimately reduce heart disease long-term .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea Children : An Opportunity Cardiovascular Risk Modification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statement Problem : In Canada , child adolescent obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 95th percentile age gender1 represent one common condition effect child Canada obesity rate 10 % 12-17 year old child , currently equate approximately half million obese child Canada . Obesity complicate cardiovascular metabolic dysfunction , leave ventricular modeling , hypertension , glucose intolerance dyslipidaemia , also associate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) , occur 60 % obese child . OSAS characterize snoring , recurrent partial ( hypopnea ) complete obstruction ( apnea ) upper airway , frequently associate intermittent oxyhaemoglobin desaturations , sleep disruption fragmentation . The gold standard test diagnose obstructive sleep apnea polysomnogram ( PSG ) . Specifically , OSAS affect 1-4 % healthy child typically 2-8 year age6 , coincide adenotonsillar hypertrophy , commonest cause OSAS child . Usual treatment OSAS child adenotonsillar hypertrophy adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) . However , clear evidence high prevalence obstructive sleep apnea obese child , , AT successful resolution OSAS . This , part due fact adenotonsillar hypertrophy single significant risk factor OSAS obese population . The factor implicate pathophysiology OSAS obese child include soft tissue restrict upper airway size fat pad soft palate , lateral pharyngeal wall base tongue . However , despite anatomic evidence predispose obese child OSAS also alterations functional mechanism lead increase airway collapsibility predispose child OSAS . Specifically , obesity associate significant alteration body composition could affect chest wall mechanic weight chest wall reduce lung compliance . Functional residual capacity diminish abdominal visceral fat impinge chest cavity . Such reduction functional residual capacity compliance increase risk sleep disorder breathing mechanism hypoventilation , atelectasis ventilation perfusion mismatch increase work breathe fatigue . Moreover , hypoventilation may reduce upper airway motor tone . Further , ventilator response may alter study focus obese adult show morbidly obese subject susceptible decreased ventilatory response hypoxia hypercapnia . Given understand adenotonsillectomy curative obese child obstructive sleep apnea , weight loss would consider treatment choice . However , obesity intervention program wholly successful BMI reduction child although overweight adult , magnitude weight loss relate improvement OSAS . Thus , delivery positive airway pressure ( PAP ) either continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) increasingly use first line treatment OSAS obese child , although usually conjunction weight loss strategy . Although benefit PAP well establish adult , paucity available paediatric data . As previously mention , obesity risk factor cardiovascular metabolic dysfunction ; however , OSAS independent obesity associate cardiac remodel cardiovascular metabolic dysfunction . Specifically , untreated , obstructive sleep apnea child may lead excessive daytime sleepiness , poor school performance , hypertension , change leave ventricular mass geometry , endothelial cell dysfunction , arterial stiffness , autonomic dysfunction inflammation , Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) . Thus , OSAS context obesity may independently synergistically magnify risk already compromise cardiometabolic regulation . Several metric utilized . Physical activity level measure utilizing Habitual Activity Questionnaires . Insulin resistance measure use Fasting Glucose Fasting Insulin Levels . Cardiovascular marker include 24 hour blood pressure cardiogram - leave ventricular mass index . C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) utilize marker inflammation . The mechanisms link OSAS obesity cardiometabolic dysfunction believe due activity sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) effect oxidative stress , exacerbate proinflammatory state . Chronic , awake sympathoactivation may promote vascular remodel induce significant cardiovascular morbidity .</detailed_description>
