	<brief_title>Point-of-Care Bedside Lung Ultrasound Examination Advanced Trial Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) critical condition require dynamic evaluation intervention . Point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound examination ( PoC-BLUE ) noninvasive , readily available image modality complement physical clinical evaluation . At time , neonates infant ARDS medical intensive care unit ( ICUs ) require mechanical ventilation , make one frequently use critical care technology . However , difficulty regard accurate diagnosis ARDS administration mechanical ventilation , dynamic monitoring treatment effect administration mechanical ventilation , decision-making timing wean mechanical ventilation , often encountered majority neonates infant require mechanical ventilation . Hence , techniques expedite advance knowledge administration mechanical ventilation important clinical significance diagnosis , treatment prognosis ARDS . Preliminary research suggest BLUE high diagnostic accuracy patient acute respiratory failure , potential quantify rate degree diaphragm thin mechanical ventilation , may useful predict extubation success failure either spontaneous breathing ( SB ) pressure support ( PS ) trial . Unfortunately , study focus availability PoC-BLUE management mechanical ventilation neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome . Also , call question possible association demographic clinical confounders diagnostic accuracy PoC-BLUE diagnosis , monitor prognosis ARDS whole process mechanical ventilation . Given considerable need timely dynamic diagnosis severe condition therapy evaluation mechanical ventilation trigger integrate currently available bulk knowledge information , objective study investigate availability diagnostic accuracy PoC-BLUE Plus protocol management mechanical ventilation ARDS .</detailed_description>
