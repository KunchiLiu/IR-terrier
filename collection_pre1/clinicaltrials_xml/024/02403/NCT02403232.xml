	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease immunologically mediate inflammatory bowel disease report incidence 4.0-7.0 , 7.1 , 1.34 per 100,000 person Europe , U.S. , Korea , respectively . Uncontrolled chronic inflammation finally cause various complication intestine bowel obstruction , fistula , abscess , anal fissure . The incidence perianal fistula report 13 % - 39 % patient Crohn 's disease . Medical treatment Crohn 's fistula initially focus surgical intervention accompany symptomatic treatment antibiotic immunosuppressant . The serious problem surgical intervention relatively high incidence postoperative anal incontinence cause sphincter injury procedure . Conversely , available pharmacological therapy Crohn 's fistula base biologic agent infliximab generally reach ideal goal treatment ( e.g. , complete closure fistula ) . A high recurrence rate treatment infliximab also report , even long-term maintenance therapy , suggest infliximab monotherapy provide adequate healing . The ACCENT II study demonstraded complete fistula heal 25 % patient . To reach well clinical outcome , combination treatment infliximab surgical intervention highly recommended management Crohn 's fistula . Nonetheless , even strategy result satisfactory heal many patient . The ideal therapeutic goal treatment complete closure fistula without recurrence also preservation anal sphincter function . Unfortunately , currently available medical surgical treatment likely offer cure perianal fistula , note , recurrence frequently report . Together active research field bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSCs ) hematopoietic stem cell , autologous allogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cell ( ASCs ) study management Crohn 's disease disorder . Of particular relevance study , ASCs could consider safe efficacious therapeutic tool treatment Crohn 's fistula . Importantly , ASCs cause fecal incontinence injection lesion site Crohn 's disease patient . A phase I dose-escalation clinical study ASCs manufacture Anterogen Co. , Ltd. ( Seoul , Korea ) demonstrate safety therapeutic potential cell treatment Crohn 's fistula . A phase II study demonstrate good rate cronh 's related fistula closure use ASCS injection . Actually best accepted treatment Crohn relate perianal fistula , surgical procedure association whit medical therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose-derived Stem Cells ( ASCs ) Treatment Perianal Fistula Crohn Disease : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic information : Lipogems : Lipogems® system disposable device liposuction , process adipose tissue reinjection . Procedure take place single surgical time . It 's disposable device progressively reduce adipose tissue cluster size , wash completely pro-inflammatory oil blood debrides minimal manipulation `` free enzyme '' aseptic close system completely preﬁlled room temperature physiological solution . Lipogems product non-expanded microfractured fat tissue ready autologous setting . SalveColl-E : Salvecoll® sterile bioplastic , equine derive , type I collagen material fully preserve fibrous structure ( non-reconstructed ) ensure regeneration affect tissue . Type I collagen zero risk transmit viral microbial infection . Rationale trial : To evaluate efficacy use ACSS crohn relate perianal fistula . The aim study improve fistula heal 1 year 25 % 65 % . Treatment subject At time fistula diagnosis patient screen eligibility inform consent administer . All patient underwent loose seton placement antibiotic prophylaxis administration Ciprofloxacin Metronidazole obtain pelvis sepsis resolution time 0 . At week 4 surgical procedure perform . In general anesthesia antibiotic prophylaxis administrate subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue collect LIPOGEMS system prepare ASCS . In infiltration step , adrenalin saline solution ( 2 μg/ml final concentration ) infiltrate use 19-cm specially design disposable blunt cannula . The vasoconstriction together blunt point cannula avoids accidental intravascular injection facilitates subsequent lipoaspiration . Three hundred 500 ml usually inject chosen area fat harvesting ( usually low abdomen ) , make tissue really `` fill '' inject solution . The aspiration step ( lipoaspirate ) perform luer lock syringe connect disposable 19-cm blunt cannula ( 3 mm OD ) , 5 oval hole ( 1 ´ 2 mm ) . A stroke use standard liposuction technique enough harvest 6-10 ml fat tissue . Vacuum aspirate obtain manually clamp syringe plunger clamp instrument . Up 1,000 ml harvest less 15 min , 1-2 min enough . The harvested lipoaspirate progressively put device use multiple 10-cc syrinx . Subsequently , lithotomy position , seton remove fistula tract thoroughly curetted irrigate . After mucosal flap prepare round internal opening , cell inject perianal adipose tissue . Between 40 130 ml lipoaspirate ( ideally 100 ml ) process time standard 225-ml device . To avoid cell damage , air device procedural step device prefilled saline beginning processing . The aspirated fat always surround liquid environment : essential obtain healthy small fat cluster instead oil adipose tissue debris . The first cluster reduction obtain push aspirate fat syringe device first size reduction filter allow correspond quantity saline exit towards waste bag . The final Lipogems product collect 10-ml syrinx connect upper opening device . The final Lipogems product ready injection perianal fistula . After SALVECOLL-E paste injection fistula tract mucosal flap may close absorbable interrupted suture . A external opening seal Dermabond Mini . The patient receive intravenous infusion Infliximab ( Remicade ) dose 5 mg per kilogram body weight week 8 , 10 , 14 every 8 week total nine dos . Rationale treatment The ASCS injection perianal adipose tissue association Infliximab therapy , would improve crohn related perianal fistula healing . This association could reduce recurrence reintervention rate improvement quality life . Trial population Number subject study Planned number subject screen : 10 Anticipated number trial site : 1 Withdrawal criteria The subject may withdraw time . The patient may withdraw trial discretion investigator safety concern . If patient withdraws withdraw time receive trial product , final safety information obtain . Patients deem surgery suitable include protocol withdrawn study . In case subject prematurely withdraw trial Investigator ensure procedure last visit undertaken , possible . The primary reason ( adverse event , non-compliance protocol ) discontinuation must specify CRF . A patient withdrawn study analyze accord evaluability Subjects Analysis . Methods assessment Visit procedures The study comprise follow visit : - Visit 1 : Diagnosis , baseline visit first surgery procedure : Screening patient , Baseline examination , Pre-surgery surgery assessment , Informed consent . - Visit 2 : Treatment visit : Surgery - Visit 3 : Medical treatment : start Infliximab administration - Visit 4 , 5 , 6 , 7,8,9 : Medical treatment follow-up - Visit 10 : end study : last infliximab dose In case premature discontinuation trial , patient , possible , call last visit . Even patient able attend , End Trial Form must complete . The Investigator must keep subject screen log subject enrolment log . These combine one document . Subjects enrol trial provide document state he/she trial , contact address telephone number . In case subject prematurely withdraw trial Investigator ensure procedure last visit undertaken , possible . The primary reason ( adverse event , non-compliance protocol ) discontinuation must specify CRF . All patient classify accord American Society Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification describe . No restriction regard ASA status apply trial . Patient Compliance The investigator reinforce compliance protocol ensure patient willing follow trial procedure enrol trial . Definitions adverse event Adverse event ( AE ) : Any untoward medical occurrence subject clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An adverse event therefore unfavourable unintended sign ( e.g. , include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider related medicinal product . Note : This include event first trial relate activity subject sign informed consent post treatment follow-up period define protocol . The follow record AEs : - Pre-planned procedure unless condition procedure plan worsen first trial relate activity subject sign informed consent . - Pre-existing condition find result screening procedure . These record medical history/concomitant illness . An AE also clinical laboratory abnormality regard clinically significant i.e . abnormality suggest disease and/or organ toxicity severity require active management ( i.e . discontinuation trial product , frequent follow-up diagnostic investigation ) . The following event record adverse event , discomfort expect related surgical procedure : - Post operative nausea/vomit - Post operative sore throat due intubation - Post operative pain due surgical intervention within 3 month operation . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) : A SAE experience dose result follow : - Death - A life-threatening* experience - In-subject hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - A persistent significant disability/incapacity - Important medical event may result death , life-threatening* , require hospitalization may consider SAE , base upon appropriate medical judgment , may jeopardize subject may require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition . - The term `` life-threatening '' definition SAE refers event subject risk death time event . It refer event hypothetically might cause death severe . Non-serious adverse event : A non-serious AE AE fulfil definition serious AE . Severity assessment definition : - Mild - No transient symptom , interference subject 's daily activity . - Moderate - Marked symptom , moderate interference subject 's daily activity . - Severe - Considerable interference subject 's daily activity , unacceptable . Relationship trial product assessment definition : - Probable : good reason sufficient documentation assume causal relationship - Possible : causal relationship conceivable dismiss - Unlikely : event likely related aetiology trial product Outcome category definition : - Recovered - Fully recover , medical surgical treatment condition return level observe first trial relate activity subject sign informed consent . - Recovering - The condition improve subject expect recover event . This term use subject complete trial . - Recovered sequelae - As result AE subject suffer persistent significant disability/incapacity ( e.g . become blind , deaf , paralyze ) . Any AE recover sequelae rat SAE . - Not recover . - Fatal . - Unknown - This term use case subject</detailed_description>
