	<brief_summary>Theranostics use diagnostic test decide patient benefit certain treatment . The current standard treatment patient myeloma induction chemotherapy follow peripheral stem cell transplant . Although option time treatment , patient outcome variable investigator currently know patient benefit treatment schedule . There evidence suggest residual disease image treatment indicator bad prognosis , however best time point image currently know . This study design show optimum time point correlation image prognosis . Several study indicate MRI well detect disease FDG PET/CT investigator confirm patient first diagnose , perform FDG PET/CT whole body diffusion weight MRI . Patients follow whole body diffusion weight MRI induction chemotherapy 3 month post autograft . The investigator look amount disease present scan correlate outcome . There likely factor influence patient outcome ( genetics ) investigator also look . Patients undergo autograft regular blood test marrow sample take part routine care , investigator use sample ( without compromise patient treatment ) analyse factor . If investigator able determine correlation genetic factor outcome information could use future research . Theranostics use diagnostic test decide patient benefit certain treatment .
