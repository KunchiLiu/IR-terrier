	<detailed_description>Objectives : Investigating effectiveness soft tissue mobilization baby congenital muscular torticollis deformational plagiocephaly . Design : A Randomized control trial design Setting : University research department Participants : Babies congenital muscular torticollis , age 0-6 month , head tilt 5 20 degree health problem participant study . The study include two group ; home program group see every six week , study group addition home program also receive soft tissue mobilization three time week . All group receive baseline home program consist positioning , handle strategy plus stretch , stretch strengthen exercise , environmental adaptation classical massage . Babies allocate two group seal envelope randomization . Babies evaluate initially , sixth week , 12 week follow-up 18 week muscle function scale , head tilt ear shift assessment include photograph method , neck normal range motion ( lateral flexion rotation ) plagiocephaly severity scale</detailed_description>
