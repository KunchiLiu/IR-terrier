	<brief_summary>Acromegaly associate increase risk difficult intubation management . The overall incidence difficult intubation patient suffer acromegaly four five time without acromegaly.The difficult intubation scenario patient manage various method range awake fiberoptic intubation tracheostomy . Difficult tracheal intubation account 17 % respiratory-related injury result significant morbidity mortality general population . In patient acromegaly , inability mask ventilate intubate lead 28 % anesthesia related death . Therefore , need importance airway assessment patient acromegaly overemphasize . Various test airway assessment used ass difficult airway tracheal intubation acromegalics . The investigator aim assess various test airway assessment affect outcome patient acromegaly undergoing pituitary surgery identify best suit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Airway Patients With Acromegaly Predicting Successful Tracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient either gender , diagnose case acromegaly schedule pituitary surgery enrol . This observational study conduct period 3 year . A write informed consent take patient . The clinical diagnosis make basis growth hormone ( GH ) level magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) finding . All patient evaluate preoperatively , day surgery independent observer . Airway assessment difficult intubation perform use Modified Mallampati classification sit supine position follow mouth opening , upper lip bite test , measurement thyromental , thyrohyoid , sternomental hyomental distance . Next length upper incisor , presence recede mandible neck movement check . An associated history OSA also take account assess difficult intubation follow OSA grade acromegalic patient post pituitary surgery . In situation difficult tracheal intubation fiberoptic intubation would prefer choice , gold standard . General anesthesia induce fentanyl 2Âµg/kg , propofol 2 mg/kg rocuronium 1mg/kg . After 90 second mask ventilation , laryngoscopy perform appropriate size Macintosh laryngoscope thereafter Cormac lehane grade note . External laryngeal manipulation ( ELM ) carry note . A standard anesthesia protocol follow . After completion surgery , neuromuscular blockade reverse neostigmine 0.05mg/kg glycopyrrolate 0.01mg/kg intravenously . Once patient follow verbal command respiratory parameter satisfactory , endotracheal tube remove . All patient shift neurosurgical ICU observation supportive management .</detailed_description>
