	<brief_summary>Aim : evaluate additional effect 12 week usage Streptococcus contain probiotic tablet scale rootplaning compare placebo tablet . Materials method : 48 periodontitis patient include double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . After scale rootplaning , give patient use either placebo ( SRP ) probiotic tablet ( SRP + P ) , 2 time day 12 week . Clinical microbiological parameter study record 24 week scale rootplaning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Materials method This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) control trial two parallel arm involve 48 patient advanced adult periodontitis . They recruit periodontology department Cukurova university , Turkey . All patient refer periodontal treatment screen eligibility.The project approve ethical committee clinical trial Cukurova University Turkey number . No change trial design make approval Ethical Committee . Sample size calculation randomization Power analysis prior start study difficult since previous randomize control trial study product available . The sample size determine . Pocket probe depth take account , expect difference 0.82mm standard deviation 0.61mm . It calculate 10 patient need group provide 80 % power alpha 0.05 . Despite low number take consideration study compare adjunctive effect antibiotic scale rootplaning , decide include 24 patient group . Randomization patient do block randomization . The study coordinator distribute coded bottle examiner baseline , 4 week 8 week visit . Except study coordinator , patient study personnel blind study group allocation . Before send data biostatistician , code broken group patient proper group . Treatment protocol Patients fulfil eligibility criterion ask participate study approval sign inform consent . Baseline examination include full-mouth probe pocket depth , gingival recession bleed probe measure six site per tooth . Additionally plaque en gingival index note . The full-mouth plaque index recorded.After baseline periodontal examination microbial analysis , oral hygiene instruction give ( toothbrush , interdental brush ) . Initial periodontal therapy consist full-mouth one-stage disinfection approach . All clinical procedure perform periodontist . The patient ask rinse 2 minute 0.12 % chlorhexidine solution without alcohol . Scaling rootplaning perform 2 consecutive day use ultrasonic scaler 0.12 % chlorhexidine irrigation hand instrument . All mucosal surface afterwards disinfect tongue brush 1 minute . Besides , participant randomize 2 treatment group : control probiotic group.The participant probiotic group ask let probiotic tablet dissolve tongue 2 time day 3 month . The participant control group ask placebo tablet . All patient instruct use tablet brush teeth morning evening . The probiotic placebo tablet identical shape , texture , taste composition except Streptococcus add probiotic tablet . All patient supply toothpaste . It ask use probiotic containing product course study . Neither allow use drug anti-inflammatory property , chlorhexidine mouthrinses study . At designated time point , follow-up visit plan . 30 day 60 day initiation therapy clinical evaluation microbial analysis perform . 90 day 180 day initial treatment baseline parameter record . Outcomes variables interest Primary outcome measure The primary response variable Probing pocket depth . All examination perform North Carolina periodontal probe . Secondary outcome measure The secondary response variable recession , clinical attachment level , Bleeding , Gingival index , Plaque index microbial parameter . Sub-analyses perform outcome variable take account initial Pocket . A pocket consider moderate initial Pocket 4 6 mm deep ≥7 mm . `` Risk disease progression '' define patient level . The `` need surgery '' outcome measure calculate . A site consider `` need surgery '' Pocket ≥6 mm 5 mm Bleeding positive . A tooth consider need surgery least one site need surgery . A patient consider need surgery least one tooth need surgery . Microbiological sample collect supragingival subgingival plaque , saliva tongue . Pooled supragingival plaque sample take aid curettes four single-rooted teeth deep initial pocket quadrant . Before sample , site isolate saliva aid cotton roll dry compressed air . All supragingival plaque site disperse . Samples disperse use vortex mixer immediately frozen -20°C analysis . On teeth pool subgingival plaque sample collect per site . After 10 , sample transfer sterile Eppendorf tube , describe Saliva sample obtain collect unstimulated saliva sterile cup . Finally biofilm tongue collect cotton swab . These wipe 10 time tongue start tongue dorsum . Processing microbial sample After finish study , frozen sample send dry ice department Periodontology , immediately frozen -80°C upon arrival . sample later defrost centrifuge 13.000g . Bacterial DNA extract . A quantitative assay perform quantify certain bacteria .</detailed_description>
