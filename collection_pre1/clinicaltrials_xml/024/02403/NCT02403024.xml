	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION More 30.000 individual live colorectal cancer ( CRC ) diagnosis Denmark today . Due mark advance surgical medical treatment , well novel screen program , number expect increase come year . Numerous study show physical activity inversely associate colorectal cancer risk . A meta-analysis 52 study find regular participation physical activity reduce disease risk 24 % ( HR : 0.76 , 95 % Confidence Interval [ 95 % CI ] : 0.72 - 0.81 ) . Recent evidence furthermore show physical activity CRC diagnosis strong independent predictor overall survival , CRC-specific survival , survival disease relapse . CRC patient adhere current recommendation least 150 min moderate intensity physical activity per week estimate 10-40 % low CRC-specific 20-50 % low overall mortality risk comparison sedentary counterpart . The causative mechanism responsible protective effect fully elucidate , several study show metabolic health factor , i.e . overweight/adiposity , systemic level glucose , insulin , Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF ) -1 , leptin , adiponectin inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-α , CRP ) associate CRC prognosis . These factor , normal circumstance modifiable physical activity exercise , may constitute plausible mode action , , exercise may reduce risk disease progression well development and/or progression cardio-metabolic co-morbid disorder . BACKGROUND Over last decade , 70 study explore capacity physical exercise improve physiological ( fitness , muscle strength , body composition ) psychosocial ( fatigue , depression , emotional well-being ) outcomes patient cancer anti-neoplastic therapy although CRC among prevalent malignancy , exercise-trials perform patient group . The reason notable low number study , relative common cancer particular breast prostate cancer , may number disease treatment specific phenomenon , e.g . high prevalence co-morbidities , stoma , late-effects surgery adjuvant therapy etc. , may complicate participation traditional hospital-based exercise-programs , often comprise fitness- strength-training . A recent meta-analysis include 3 randomize trial investigate exercise CRC patient , find positive effect exercise v control cardiovascular fitness ; standardize mean difference : 0.59 [ 95 % CI 0.25-0.93 ] , P &lt; 0.01 . A recent pilot study furthermore show home-based exercise improve several metabolic factor include reduction body weight , plasma insulin level improve insulin sensitivity . Thus , data indicate CRC patient improve cardio-metabolic health profile physical exercise ; however , present body research include total less 200 patient ; explore various exercise-modalities , apply inconsistent and/or indirect assessment-methods . To end , remain need high quality evidence describe effective exercise-interventions CRC patient , particularly intervention aim successfully implement clinical practice case positive result . Interval training , characterize inter-changing cycle high low intensity exercise , long recognize effective exercise-modality improve cardiopulmonary fitness , furthermore induce equal great metabolic effect continuous exercise long duration . Considerable challenge exist however , perform high intensity interval exercise-training clinical setting . This type exercise often need performed ergometer bicycle treadmill organize supervised , hospital-based training ensure proper monitoring feedback participant optimal exercise intensity progression , limit dissemination potential beyond trial period . Center Physical Activity Research ( CFAS ) perform number trial show interval training perform free-living interval-walking , consist repeat cycle 3 minute fast walk follow 3 minute slow walk significant positive effect cardio-metabolic health profile . Our study show , 16 week interval-walking improve VO2peak ( +4ml /kg/min ) reduce bodyweight ( -4 kg ) fat mass ( -3 kg ) patient type 2 diabetes . Moreover , interval-walking improve plasma lipid-profile , glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity , contrast continuous walking , match training-volume energy expenditure . In parallel intervention-studies , smart-phone application , call InterWalk ( www.InterWalk.dk ) , develop , deliver train program repeating cycle : 3 minute fast walk follow 3 minute slow walking . The exercise-program base individualized test-function live-feedback , ensure proper exercise-intensities ( walking-speed ) , simultaneously store test- training data ( exercise-time , walking-speed , distance etc . ) external server research purpose . Preliminary data show three month home-based interval-walking use InterWalk-application improve fitness ~10 % . Thus , preliminary data show InterWalk deliver un-supervised , yet individualize , structure objectively monitor exercise-program effectively improve cardio-metabolic health , may applicable feasible , compare traditional hospital-based program stigmatize patient group major co-morbid complication . The investigator therefore propose intervention great health promote potential patient CRC ; however previous work find considerable barrier complication associate successful participation exercise-programs patient group . Thus , investigator intend explore whether interval-walking , deliver InterWalk-app , safe feasible , furthermore investigatorsintend explore intervention cause similar positive effect investigator see previously clinical population . PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESES Based promising result study type 2 diabetes , primary purpose study investigate interval-walking via InterWalk-app health promote exercise-intervention patient CRC . Specifically aim pilot study determine safety , feasibility , adherence compliance InterWalk ; well evaluate effect cardio-metabolic health profile , compare waiting-list control group . RESEARCH PLAN This prospective , randomize control pilot-study 40 CRC patient . The study collaboration Center Physical Activity Research , Rigshospitalet , Institut Folkesundhedsvidenskab , Copenhagen University , Oncology Clinic , Rigshospitalet , Abdominalcenter K , Bispebjerg Hospital , Gastroenheden Hvidovre Hospital , Patientforeningen Tarmkræft . Recruitment Randomization CRC patient recruit oncology clinic , Rigshospitalet gastro-intestinal surgical ward Hvidovre Hospital . Patients , undergone adjuvant chemotherapy , inform study final visit oncology clinic . Patients active surveillance inform study first clinical visit , least one month surgery . The responsible clinician nurse clinical department present patient write information study gather contact information interested participant study coordinator information study . Before study relate test-procedures initiate , patient sign inform consent , undergo medical screen include former present medication , physical examination include rest EKG study physician determine patient include trial subsequently schedule baseline assessment . Following baseline-assessment patient allocate one two experimental arm I ) InterWalk II ) waiting-list control . To account potential bias , patient stratify prior treatment ( adjuvant chemotherapy/no adjuvant chemotherapy ) , may significant impact study outcome . A random allocation sequence treatment assignment stratification group create trial biostatistician conceal study personal . The study coordinator inform patient treatment assignment patient remain group full study period . Study Outcomes Procedures The test procedures involve number assessment conduct 3 time study ; baseline , week 12 week 24 : 1 . Body composition DXA scan 2 . Fasting blood sample analyse plasma biochemistry ( cholesterol , triglyceride , inflammatory marker , HbA1C ) 3 . Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) repeat measure plasma glucose , insulin c-peptide 4 . Health related Quality Life questionnaires 5 . Cognitive function 6 . Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Test ( VO2peak ) Statistical Considerations The primary analysis compare difference change study outcomes 0 12 week two treatment arm InterWalk v control . For primary outcome , VO2peak , assume standard deviation 2 ml/kg/min , 16 patient group provide 80 % power detect group difference +2 ml/kg/min . To account potential attrition-rate 20 % , 20 patient include group . The primary analysis perform random effect model use study outcome dependent variable , covariates `` group '' , `` time '' interaction fix effect , random effect `` patient '' . Dropouts Missing Observations Patients wish drop-out study intervention-periods offer remain study regard test-assessments . All analysis perform 'intention-to-treat ' analysis , thus patient remain originally allocate treatment arm regardless compliance intervention . Potential drop-outs miss observation handle `` missing random '' principle . Ethical Considerations This study , describe , expect include limited risk , adverse effect discomfort subject . During assessment procedure , medical doctor present case discomfort medical problem . Should patient report discomfort adverse reaction interval-walking , study coordinator collaboration responsible clinician , determine program need adapt terminate .</detailed_description>
