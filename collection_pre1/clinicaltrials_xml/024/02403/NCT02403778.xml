	<brief_title>Ipilimumab All-Trans Retinoic Acid Combination Treatment Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The successful treatment melanoma immune checkpoint inhibitor , anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4 ) Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) antibody , alter think approach immunotherapy solid tumor . Despite advance , portion patient experience durable response suggest room improvement via enhanced immunomodulatory approach . Anti-CTLA-4 ( Ipilimumab ) significantly improve overall survival achieves long-lasting complete response melanoma patient , number patient achieve durable clinical benefit limit could improve combined immunomodulatory approach . The objective study assess safety efficacy combine treatment Ipilimumab all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) melanoma patient . We hypothesize combined treatment Ipilimumab ATRA improve patient response , increase tumor antigen-specific T cell response , decrease immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) melanoma patient compare patient treat Ipilimumab alone .</detailed_description>
