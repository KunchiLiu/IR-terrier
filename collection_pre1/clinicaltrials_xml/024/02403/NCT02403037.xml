	<brief_summary>To evaluate feasibility three-parallel-arm , placebo-controlled randomize trial use standard auricular acupressure protocol manage nausea vomit homogenous group female breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . The null hypothesis study : ( 1 ) There significant difference occurrence , frequency severity acute/delayed nausea vomiting among group intervention period ; ( 2 ) There significant difference occurrence , frequency severity anticipatory nausea vomit among group second cycle chemotherapy ; ( 3 ) There significant difference quality life status among group end first cycle chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auricular Acupressure Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea Vomiting Female Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) one common distress side-effects among cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . Despite steady progress antiemetic prophylaxis treatment past decade , approximately half cancer patient receive moderately highly emetogenic chemotherapy still experience significant nausea vomit . Considering fact CINV difficult completely control antiemetic along , healthcare professional explore role non-pharmacological intervention adjunctive therapy control CINV . Among , auricular therapy ( AT ) promise approach evidence still conclude . The aim study test feasibility randomize control trial use auricular acupressure manage nausea vomit female breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . The objective study : ( 1 ) pilot methodological procedure randomize control trial use standard auricular acupressure protocol control CINV ; ( 2 ) determine recruitment rate attrition rate whole study period ; ( 3 ) examine effect auricular acupressure occurrence , frequency severity CINV well QoL status female breast cancer patient receive chemotherapy ; ( 4 ) identify potential adverse event associate auricular acupressure ; ( 5 ) explore patient ' experience burden complete trial reason study attrition ; ( 6 ) refine study protocol future multicenter , large-scale randomize controlled trial . A three-parallel-arm , placebo-controlled randomize pilot feasibility study adopt . One hundred fourteen breast cancer patient schedule receive first cycle chemotherapy recruit three provincial hospital Fuzhou , China , randomly assign one three group : true AT group , sham AT group standard care group . Participants true AT group receive standard anti-emetic medication plus 5-day auricular acupressure specific ear acupoints , participant sham AT group receive standard anti-emetic medication plus 5-day auricular acupressure acupoints true AT group pressure apply , participant standard care group provide standard anti-emetic medication . The feasibility outcomes recruitment rate consent rate recruitment stage , attrition rate study period . The future main study outcome also measure include occurrence , frequency severity nausea vomiting , quality life ( QoL ) status potential adverse event associate AT . After complete pilot clinical trial , nest qualitative interview conduct explore participant ' experience burden complete trial reason study attrition .</detailed_description>
