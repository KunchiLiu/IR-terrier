	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Optimization growth essential preterm infant . Optimum post-natal growth show improve long-term developmental outcome . Close monitoring weight gain , include early identification growth faltering , important part appropriate nutritional management Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . Current practice neonatal intensive care unit involve routine use growth chart track identify pattern growth preterm infant . Perhaps popular growth chart use today Fenton Growth Chart . To interpret chart , patient 's growth curve plot set standard curve ( typically represent 10th , 25th , 50th , 75th 90th weight-for-age centile ) . The curve visually compare identify pattern growth ( adequate , slow , catch-up growth ) . Patterns neonatal growth may subtle current growth curve may prone misinterpretation . This may due bias inherent human visual perception system , include difficulty visually estimate slope angle two curve . An improved growth chart would use horizontal line rather curve , would oblique line skew visual perception . Z-score growth chart accomplish . Z-score growth chart create use standardize data use create Fenton Growth Chart . Z-scores represent standard deviation score . Rather use set standard curve represent average healthy growth , z-score chart use single horizontal line . This allow easy comparison plot patient 's weight time . Such chart may lead accurate interpretation overall growth pattern . This study compare accuracy interpretation growth data use standard - present use traditional weight-vs.-age chart , use data display Z-score v age chart . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA It include UC Davis Medical Center healthcare personnel interpret growth chart preterm infant . This may include follow : - Attending Neonatologists - Attending Pediatricians - Dietitians - Medical Students - Neonatal Fellows - Neonatal Nurse Practitioners - Pediatric Residents This study exclude person routinely interpret growth chart preterm infant part clinical responsibility . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS This single center study . The sample size need 80 % power alpha 0.05 estimate least 40 . Approaching 45-50 provider sufficient achieve number . RECRUITMENT METHODS Healthcare provider meet inclusion criterion approach individual and/or group basis . We may attempt hold meeting ( perhaps lunch time ) volunteer may participate study . COMPENSATION TO SUBJECTS If meeting hold lunchtime volunteer participate study , may small lunch provide ( sandwich , pizza and/or soft drink ) . When subject approach individual basis , compensation offer . STUDY TIMELINES - The duration individual subject 's participation study : le one hour . - The duration anticipate enroll study subject : three six month . - The estimated date investigator complete study ( complete primary analysis ) : Less six month STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint : 40-50 person complete study . Primary secondary safety endpoint : foreseeable safety issue participate questionnaire base study . PROCEDURES INVOLVED Study design : - Study subject ask view brief presentation . This describe Fenton Preterm Z-score growth chart , review interpret . - Hypothetical ( i.e . dummy data ) 10-20 infant display weigh vs. age chart Z-score v age chart . The data consist 2 point approximately 1-2w apart . Subjects ask whether growth two point `` normal '' ( parallel centile line weight vs age chart , horizontal Z-score v age chart ) , `` slow normal '' `` faster normal '' ) . The order presentation chart randomize - Subjects record interpretation growth data sheet ( mark box `` normal '' , `` faster normal '' `` slow normal '' . - At end presentation subject ask record level training ( medical student , resident , fellow , NNP , neonatal attending , ) sheet . - A space provide datasheet subject record impression chart may wish share . - Subjects provide unmarked envelope put datasheets return investigator ( investigator unaware answer , whether subject complete datasheet )</detailed_description>
