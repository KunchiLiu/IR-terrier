	<brief_title>Dimensional Soft Hard Tissue Alterations Following Single Tooth Extraction Anterior Maxilla - A Prospective Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The alveolar process tooth dependent tissue develop conjunction eruption teeth . The size form tooth , axis eruption eventual inclination determine local volume well shape alveolar process . It show remove teeth human , alveolar ridge undergoes process resorption atrophy . In recent animal study , Cardaropoli et al . ( 2003 ) assess heal event occur extraction socket follow tooth removal . The finding study demonstrate heal extraction socket involve series event include formation coagulum replace provisional connective tissue matrix , woven bone lamellar bone bone marrow . On day 30 , mineralize bone occupy 88 % socket volume . Hard tissue formation start already 2 week healing , , month , socket fill woven bone . Later , woven bone gradually replace lamellar bone bone marrow . After 3 month heal , hard tissue bridge consistently find cover crestal portion extraction site , form woven bone lamellar bone . Ara√∫jo et al . ( 2005 ) analyse experimental study dog ridge alteration follow extraction premolar mandible . The author observe resorption buccal lingual wall occur two overlap phase . Phase 1 : The bundle bone - lose function blood supply - resorbed replace woven bone . Vertical resorption considerably great buccal aspect alveolar crest , since bone wall much thinner lingual wall primarily comprise bundle bone . Phase 2 : An additional resorption occur out surface bone wall . The reason additional resorption clearly ascertain . The hypothesis could : Impaired superficial vascularisation raise mucoperiosteal flap ; adjust lack continuous function ; reestablishment ridge shape , genetically determine absence teeth . A recent animal study confirm flap elevation play important role pronounce superficial bone resorption follow extraction , therefore , seem critical tooth extraction carry without elevation mucoperiosteal flap . Even ridge preservation technique able prevent contour change tooth extraction . Objective The aim present clinical study examine dimensional change alveolar ridge follow single tooth extraction anterior maxilla patient , particular facial aspect alveolar ridge . These horizontal vertical change sequentially document 8 week heal implant insert use concept early implant placement . The study also provide information anatomic situation facial bone wall anterior maxilla time extraction , prevalence extent bone deficiencies facial aspect , teeth need extract . Methods To document change time , two method apply . Firstly , two cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) obtain , one directly tooth extraction , one 8 week socket heal prior implant placement . The two CBCT 's analyze novel software program ( InVivo Dental ) . Secondly , consecutive impression make day 0 ( day extraction ) , day 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 digitally produce virtual 3D study model . These model analyze another software program ( Geomagic ) document variation soft tissue extraction site .</detailed_description>
