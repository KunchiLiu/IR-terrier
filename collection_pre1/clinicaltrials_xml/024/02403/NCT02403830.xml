	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor associate prompt potent antiplatelet effect compare clopidogrel , lead well clinical outcome , include reduce cardiovascular mortality , across spectrum patient acute coronary syndrome , include ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . However , latter set delay onset antiplatelet effect show . Morphine identify cause delay P2Y12 inhibition patient STEMI . In fact , opiates known inhibit gastric emptying , lead delay absorption potentially decrease peak plasma level orally administer drug . Methylnaltrexone parenteral peripheral opioid receptor antagonist potential prevent reverse opioid-induced peripherally mediate side effect ( i.e . gastric empty inhibition ) without affect analgesia . Studies show methylnaltrexone effectively prevent morphine-induced gut motility change . However , whether use intravenous methylnaltrexone may overcome effect morphine administration pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) profile ticagrelor investigate yet . The propose investigation include patient coronary artery disease prospective , randomize , cross-over design . Patients randomize receive either intravenous methylnaltrexone placebo . Immediately methylnaltrexone administration , patient receive intravenous morphine receive 180-mg ticagrelor load dose 15 minute morphine administration . After 7 Â± 2 day wash-out period , patient cross-over alternate study-treatment arm . At visit , blood sample PK PD assessment collect several time point . This study provide insight possible treatment strategy overcome impair P2Y12 inhibition induce morphine .</detailed_description>
