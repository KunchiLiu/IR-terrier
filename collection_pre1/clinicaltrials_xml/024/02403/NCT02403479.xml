Standard management option include topical steroid , antibiotic surgery , treatment-resistant CRSsP frequently encounter . Bacterial biofilms routinely detect within nasal mucosa CRSsP patient think play important role protracted nature disease .

	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Topical Silver Colloid Treating Patients With Recalcitrant Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The paranasal sinuses within bone face head . Six pair sinus present human , although exact function topic debate , appear play several role range cushion brain trauma increase resonance voice release nitric oxide help lung physiology . The sinus line layer respiratory epithelium normally secrete small amount mucus keep sinus lubricate contains cilia help sweep away debris . Rhinosinusitis occur line get infect irritated lead excessive mucus production impair mucus drainage . It prevalent condition affect 16 % population fifth common diagnosis generate antibiotic prescription1,2 . Chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis ( CRSsP ) characterize persistent symptom nasal congestion , mucus discharge nose , facial pain anosmia least three month . Unlike acute rhinosinusitis , usually cause infection , CRSsP elusive cause profoundly complicated.3 Due challenge nature CRS , physician often use variety treatment strategy it.3 Potential treatment CRSsP include lifestyle modification ( quit smoking , reduce allergen exposure , etc . ) , nasal saline irrigation , nasal corticosteroid spray irrigation , antibiotic surgery . Typically , stepwise fashion therapy offer patient whereby aggressive invasive modality reserve benefit simple approach . Even despite regimen small subset patient continue fare poorly . One thought toward reason center frequent presence biofilms within sinus recalcitrant CRSsP patients.4 Biofilms report CRS population decade number authors.4,5 Furthermore , presence link severe disease pre post-operatively . Using fluorescence situ hybridization investigator able identify staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) Haemophilus influenza ( H. influenza ) common biofilm-forming organisms.5 In fact , H. influenza biofilms seem common milder pattern CRS , whereas S. aureus biofilms present severe , refractory form disease.5 A recently publish study demonstrate colloidal silver directly attenuate S. aureus biofilms vitro herein lay premise study.6 Interest colloidal silver , commercially available naturopathic product , spark clinical improvement see number recalcitrant CRS patient spray agent intranasally . Silver long use bactericidal property , one toxic element microorganisms.7 Silver-impregnated dressing catheter currently use treatment burn , ulcer chronic wound . Clear advantage silver modern antibiotic include broad spectrum activity Gram-positive Gram-negative organism , fungi , protozoa virus well general absence resistance develop number bacterial species.7,8 In addition , silver show activity Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development.9 The main reason colloidal silver fell use antiseptic due large part advent antibiotic , uncertain safety , production argyria ingestion10 . Although yet know dose silver require cause argyria , case report date follow excessive daily consumption element period years10,11 . Topical application silver report cause localize argyria whereas systemic toxicity generally result longstanding oral intake12 . Argyria le benign condition characterize slate-grey metallic appearance skin . Apart skin discoloration , extreme case systemic silver toxicity associate thrombocytopenia , abnormal clotting , renal impairment , proteinuria , neurological symptom seizure , loss coordination sensory loss12 . All possible side effect exceedingly rare expect issue study . There , however , possibility might localize pigmentation nasal mucosa , significant consequences13 . Our goal project test whether topical silver colloid feasible treatment option patient refractory CRS . With recent publication proof mechanism study6 , investigator look extend notion proof concept investigation . The investigator propose take twenty volunteer patient recalcitrant CRS trial course daily intranasal silver colloid three-month period . Pre post-treatment measurement take use validated score system CRS patients14-16 . These include Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22 ) 14 , Lund-Kennedy score15 Smell Identification Test16 , examine quality life index , endoscopic assessment sense smell , respectively . Should result preliminary study favor silver colloid use CRS patient investigator look arrange formal Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trial .</detailed_description>
