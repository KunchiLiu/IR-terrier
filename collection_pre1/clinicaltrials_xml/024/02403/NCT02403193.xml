	<brief_title>Trial PBF-509 PDR001 Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single institution phase I/Ib ( dose escalation plus expansion ) clinical trial PBF-509 combination treatment PDR001 plus PBF-509 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0-1 patient immunotherapy naïve pretreated , advanced metastatic NSCLC conduct evaluate safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy combination . The main objective propose Phase I trial : Phase I Dose Escalation : - To determine safety tolerability PBF-509 phase I dose escalation trial - Determine pharmacokinetic profile PBF-509 - Determine safety profile PBF-509 Phase 1 Dose Expansion : • To determine safety tolerability PBF-509 recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) Phase Ib Dose Escalation : - To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) PBF-509 combination PDR001 - To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PBF-509 combination PDR001 Phase Ib Expansion : - To determine safety tolerability PBF-509 combination PDR001 , RP2D , immunotherapy naïve pretreated advanced NSCLC - To evaluate response rate ( ORR ) PBF-509 combination PDR001 , RP2D , immunotherapy naïve pretreated advanced NSCLC - To evaluate progression free ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) PBF-509 combination PDR001 , RP2D , immunotherapy naïve pretreated advanced NSCLC - To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PBF-509 combination PDR001 Correlative ( Exploratory ) Studies : - To evaluate biological activity PBF-509 alone combination PDR001 assessment potential pharmacodynamic ( PD ) biomarkers tumor biopsy specimens patient advance NSCLC - To determine association pre- on-treatment expression immune checkpoint gene resistance single agent PBF-509 dual immune inhibitory ( PDR001+ PBF-509 ) treatment . - Determine pharmacokinetics PDR001 combination PBF-509 The phase I phase Ib dose escalation conduct utilizing standard 3+3 dose escalation method . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data obtain PBF-509 PDR001 . The phase Ib dose expansion consist 2 independent group immunotherapy naïve pretreated ( previous immune checkpoint inhibitor ; anti-CTLA-4 , anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1 and/or combination ) patient . Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data obtain potential biomarker analysis pre-treatment on-treatment tumor biopsy . Number Patients : Phase I Dose escalation safety expansion : 15-18 patient treat single agent PBF-509 escalation 20 patient may treat RP2D safety expansion group . Phase Ib Dose escalation : 15-24 patient treat The specific number patient enrol vary depend whether additional patient could require escalation period dose de-escalation cohort intermediate dos enrol , dose-escalation cohort expand . Phase Ib Dose Expansion : 20 patient per group enrol total 40 patient . Assuming 10-15 % eligibility/screen failure , maximum 50 patient enrol . Safety Assessments : The maximun tolerate dose ( MTD ) evaluation base dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) Evaluable Population include patient enrol dose-escalation portion trial , receive protocol-assigned treatment PDR001 PBF-509 complete safety follow-up DLT evaluation period , experience DLT DLT evaluation period . The safety evaluation base treated Population , include patient receive dose investigational product , include adverse event ( AEs ) , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , laboratory evaluation electrocardiogram ( ECG ) result . AEs grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) v4.03 describe system organ class preferred tem use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) . Clinically relevant Laboratory abnormality toxicity grade accord NCI CTCAE v4.03 derive summarize . Efficacy Assessments : The efficacy analysis base treated Population include patient receive dose either investigational product . The following efficacy endpoint analyze : 1 . Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) define confirm complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) base modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 . Disease control rate ( DCR ) define CR , PR , stable disease ( SD ) base modify RECIST v1.1 . 2 . Duration response ( DoR ) define duration first documentation Objective response ( OR ) first document disease progression death due cause , whichever occur first . 3 . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) measure start treatment documentation disease progression death due cause , whichever occur first . 4 . Overall survival ( OS ) determine time start treatment PDR001 PBF-509 death due cause</detailed_description>
