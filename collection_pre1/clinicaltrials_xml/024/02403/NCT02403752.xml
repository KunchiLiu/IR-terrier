	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's dementia ( AD ) major public health challenge century . Research pharmaceutical therapy disappoint provide safe medication halt disease 's trajectory decline cognitive , functional , emotional social capability affect individual . For non-pharmacological approach , multi-domain exercise program address several capability integrate way show strong promise ability slow decline . The team investigator systematically develop one program—the Preventing Loss Independence Exercise ( PLIÉ ) program—an integrative exercise program use procedural memory ( memory movement without explicit recall ) , taught integrated senior day care center pilot-tested team encourage result functional , cognitive social outcome ( see Table 1 ) . However , ( 1 ) people community access day care center , concerned stigma associate day care unable afford . This endorse semi-structured interview conduct caregiver community-based organization preparation large study PLIÉ program . There huge need innovative program assist individual dementia caregiver community . Irrespective access day care , motivate caregiver , aware benefit exercise love one spend hour alone home , ask : `` What [ e.g . mother ] ? '' They point major lack guidance caregiver community able use regular exercise practice long-term basis home . Caregivers senior dementia live together community dyad need paired exercise program . ( 2 ) How exercise may delay cognitive functional decline unknown . One hypothetical mechanism action improve brain oxygenation related exercise . Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive method assess regional cortical oxygenation level , suggest early diagnosis Alzheimer 's dementia , never apply longitudinal study population . Paired home exercise program senior dementia primary caregiver rarely study . A pilot study use 6 'sticky hand ' movement variation base Tai Chi , music exercise incentives find improvement 2 outcome measure consider important fall prevention ( sit-to-stand time , one-legged stance time ) . However , movement limit tai chi outcomes fall-related function , leave cognitive function PLIÉ program show promising result . The group investigator establish collaboration Osher Center Integrative Medicine Department Psychiatry UCSF recently pioneer novel , 45-minute , multi-domain program call Preventing Loss Independence Exercise ( PLIÉ ) integrate physical activity ( train procedural memory basic daily activity sit stand ) , cognitive stimulation ( mindful body awareness ) , social engagement ( group movement share in-the-moment experience ) , caregiver education ( monthly home-visit ) . The investigator pilot-tested PLIÉ 11 individual mild moderate dementia attend adult day program Institute Aging San Francisco , CA ( ClinicalTrials.gov register NCT01371214 ) , find ( Table 1 ) preliminary evidence medium large , clinically meaningful effect size com-pared usual care ( UC ; 45 minute usual chair-based exercise day care center ) across wide range out-comes include measure quality life ( 0.83 ) , cognitive function ( 0.76 ) , physical performance ( 0.34 ) caregiver burden ( 0.49 ) .7,11 That study methodologically mimic drug study include measure commonly use dementia medication trial , enable comparison magnitude result currently available dementia medications.. The investigator complete data collection second implementation PLIÉ program adult day program San Rafael , CA ( Senior Access ) . The intervention current proposal similar PLIÉ use principles6 taught instructor train PLIÉ program . However , differ format : instead day-care center-based group program teach professional exercise instructor , use dyadic approach , introduce caregiver support group pair individual dementia caregiver , initially use group class format , teach enable caregiver practice independently home . To allow wide-spread long-term routine application , brief ( 20 minute ) , use personalize music associate positive affect memory , support video instruction . 2 paper publish study . Therefore , investigator propose study pair integrative exercise intervention practice dyad caregiver affect individual home community-based support group environment , require additional equipment , easily learn caregiver , may ameliorate impact dementia old person caregiver . The investigator suggest multimodal program base implicit procedural learn integrative principle PLIÉ program : include physical ( touch ) social interaction trust family member , focus physical function balance , include personalized music choice singing , support positive affect , use language cognitively enhance experience mind-body integration . It promote playful , non-judgmental supportive attitude foster sense embody personhood individual dementia joyful social interaction empower caregiver . 1 . Recruitment . Study participant recruit local caregiver support group Kaiser Permanente Oakland . Exercise instructor PI already invite give presentation regular meeting . Contacts establish 3 caregiver support group meet Kaiser Permanente Oakland , total 100 caregiver , meet month confirm strong interest participate . Thus , highly likely twice able recruit 10 dyad eligible participant . In addition , investigator give study flyer caregiver support manager Kaiser Permanente , local Alzheimer 's Association group , Alzheimer 's Services East Bay ( ASEB ) . In addition , recruit ASEB . Caregivers inform study brief presentation PI exercise instructor regular support group meeting . A flyer hand interested potential participant describe study provide opportunity learn return form call research study staff . Those caregiver express interest contact research staff phone ass interest/eligibility schedule consent visit . 2 . Informed consent . Verbal consent screen obtain telephone prior collect information demographic medical psychiatric history . Written consent obtain affected individual caregiver together , describe detail . The consent form review capacity consent assess primary participant base response question determine level understanding study procedure , risk , benefit right . Participants demonstrate capacity consent ask assent study procedure caregiver ask consent behalf . A separate consent form request permission participate video record exercise class quality control purpose . After consent process complete , Modified Mini-Mental State Exam ( 3MS ) administer affected individual assess level cognitive impairment . Consent procedure take place Kaiser group room unless otherwise request caregiver . If caregiver Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) legal guardian affect individual , screen interview stop . Investigators mail letter LAR legal guardian invite her/him contact u mail phone discus study consent process . The screen eligibility question affect individual complete LAR legal guardian . If investigator get response within 2 week call LAR legal guardian phone assume she/he receive letter . Only person permit affect individual 's study participation investigator contact caregiver affect individual . How investigator assess potential participant 's capacity consent ? Capacity consent assess research assistant ( RA ) extensively trained PI co-investigators use standardized procedure . Investigators first provide consent form patient caregiver together allow review . RAs describe key point form , point area form information describe detail . They ask series yes/no question ass understand information form . If participant answer question , RAs review material point section form . Investigators repeat question . If participant unable answer question review , RAs consider lack capacity consent . RAs ask would like participate study obtain assent . RAs say go ask caregiver sign form participant 's behalf obtain write consent . Most team 's research assistants psychology graduate student highly sensitive work vulnerable patient . Investigators train new research staff role play consent process senior personnel determine adequately prepare . They observe senior personnel perform consent process least one study participant . Subsequently observe perform consent process senior personnel determine competent . Investigators/RAs also weekly team meeting discus difficulty arise consent study procedure . Randomization : Following baseline assessment , assess staff open opaque , seal envelop dyad ( affected individual caregiver ) . Envelops number contain group assignment . A statistician involve study prepare envelop create random sequence number use computer program . There 2 pile envelops , one men one woman recruit similar proportion male female participant group . 3 . 1st Pilot-test Phase . Affected individual/caregiver dyad consent invited participate first pilot phase 10 dyad . These subject participate either Group 1 ( initial intervention ) , participate first , Group 2 ( wait list control group ) . Group 1 participate Paired PLIÉ program 2 times/week 45 minute 4 week once/month additional 3 month Group 2 wait-listed . After Group 1 complete training , Group 2 participate PLIÉ program 2 times/week 45 minute 4 week once/month additional 3 month . Group assignment random . Investigators strive equal distribution men/women two group . Intervention : exercise protocol base PLIÉ protocol , investigator develop consultation expert worldwide experience perform different type exercise individual mild-to-moderate dementia , include traditional strength-building exercise , yoga , Tai Chi Feldenkrais . Specifically , investigator identify exercise tradition engage muscle need maintain independence -- include low body strength ( help get bed/chair ) , balance ( minimize risk fall ) , upper body strength ( help lifting ) , fine motor exercise ( help activity eat brush teeth ) , pelvic floor exercise ( help continence ) -- combine unique integrative exercise program . These exercise design purposeful ( i.e. , achieve goal ) build procedural ( 'muscle ' ) memory . In addition , breathe guide meditation exercise include promote relaxation well-being . While PLIÉ program test senior day care set , investigator combine exercise new way , practice home dyad affect individual caregiver . 4 . 2nd Pilot-test Phase . In second phase investigator repeat identical protocol intervention 10 dyad affected individual caregiver . 5 . Pre- post-intervention assessment . Investigators perform variety standard measure participant caregiver . The following assessment occur baseline 3 follow-up month . They primarily utilize assess feasibility logistics data collection procedure . Separate appointment make affected individual caregiver maximize validity data collect ( e.g. , ensure caregiver 'help ' affected individual answer question feel comfortable provide information issue difficult behavior level stress ) . Affected individual assessment take place group room . The initial caregiver assessment take place caregiver 's home group room . The first line communication follow-up appointment via telephone person minimize risk loss privacy . At caregiver participant 's request , communication may conduct via mail , email , fax text . Caregivers inform mode communication may increase risk loss privacy . Mail , email , fax text communication include confidentiality statement . The minimum amount identify information include communication . Study form include unique study ID number .</detailed_description>
