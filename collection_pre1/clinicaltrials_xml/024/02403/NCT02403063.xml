	<brief_summary>It recently show neostigmine reversal associate increased atelectasis high-dose neostigmine associate longer postoperative length stay increase incidence pulmonary edema reintubation . These study result consistent finding previous epidemiological study reveal absence beneficial effect neostigmine postoperative oxygenation reintubation . In previous study , effect neostigmine / glycopyrrolate sugammadex electromyographic activity diaphragm show beneficial effect sugammadex . This could explain possible effect neuromuscular transmission muscle level , also explain neostigmine-induced decrease total nerve activity . In study cat , neostigmine show reduce efferent phrenic nerve activity . The investigator aim show difference phrenic nerve activity neostigmine sugammadex , administer alone combination , healthy male volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electromyographic Activity Respiratory Muscles During Neostigmine Sugammadex Enhanced Recovery After Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An auxiliary surface EMG record via ordinary skin electrode diaphragm , intercostal rectus abdominis muscle . The degree neuromuscular blockade continuously measure accelerometry adductor pollicis muscle ulnar nerve stimulation ( TOF-watch SX® ) . Anesthesia induce propofol remifentanil . Manually assisted ventilation air/oxygen mixture 40 % oxygen start soon patient become apnoeic . Train-of-four ( TOF ) monitoring start induction anesthesia ( rocuronium administration ) continue awaken . The investigator insert 16 Fr . nasogastric catheter allow electrical activity diaphragm ( Edi ) registration ( NAVA , Maquet , Solna , Sweden ) . After baseline measurement , 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium inject . After tracheal intubation , subject ventilate standard ventilation mode ( tidal volume 7 ml/kg , frequency 12 breath per minute , inspire oxygen fraction 30 % ) , end-tidal PCO2 target 30-35 mmHg PEEP 5 cmH2O . SpO2 value maintain ≥98 % . Spontaneous recovery allow progress re-appearance second twitch TOF . The volunteer receive either sugammadex 2mg/kg neostigmine 50µg/kg + glycopyrrolate 10µg/kg ( use commercially available 5:1 co-formulation ) neostigmine 50µg/kg follow 3 minute later administration sugammadex 2mg/kg . At onset spontaneous respiration , arterial blood gas sample drawn . NAVA catheter position confirm use 'Edi catheter position ' tool soon signal receive . A second arterial blood gas sample drawn moment awaken . Diaphragm electromyographic activity ( Edi , obtain NAVA catheter ) , airway pressure flow acquire 100 Hz ventilator via interface connect computer use commercially available software ( Maquet Critical Care , Solna , Sweden ) . The auxiliary surface EMG record dedicate device ( Dipha16 , InBiolab , Groningen , The Netherlands ) diaphragm , intercostal rectus abdominis muscle . All data store later analyse .</detailed_description>
