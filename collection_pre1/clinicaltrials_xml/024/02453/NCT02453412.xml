	<brief_summary>Patients suffer end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) dependent renal replacement therapy ( dialysis ) . The majority dialysis facilitate hemodialysis . For hemodialysis vascular access necessary , preferable arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) vein directly anastomose artery . In order use AVF hemodialysis three criterion meet ; minimal flow AVF 600 mL/min , diameter least 6 mm , AVF locate less 6 mm skin . Unfortunately , approximately half patient ( 50 % ) confront AVF meet criterion ; call non-maturation primary failure . In case non-maturation AVF unusable dialysis , also require reinterventions short- long-term . Firstly mature AVF , secondly , AVF mature , keep vascular access . Using computational simulation postoperative flow predict . Based patient-specific duplex measurement , model calculate flow expect follow vascular access surgery AVF configuration ; fore- upper arm . These calculation lead advice configuration indicate ; flow exceed 600 mL/min , lead maturation . Potentially aforementioned 50 % non-maturation reduce . The patient adequate vascular access reinterventions advert , result decrease cost , hospital demand , increase patient ' quality life . When expect reduction non-maturation confirm , computational tool offer hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) major grow healthcare problem associate substantial cost . By end 2010 global patient population require chronic renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) exceed 2 million , approximately 90 % relies hemodialysis ( HD ) . The number patient dependent RRT expect annually increase 8 % . Based figure , expect 2030 , 7.3 million ESRD patient need HD treatment . To facilitate adequate HD therapy reliable vascular access ( VA ) mandatory provide either creation autologous arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) , prosthetic arteriovenous graft ( AVG ) central venous catheter ( CVC ) . Guidelines National Kidney Foundation ( NKF K/DOQI Guidelines ) , Vascular Access Society ( Good Nephrological Practice Guidelines ) European Dialysis Transplant Association ( European Best Practice Guidelines vascular access ) advocate implementation all-autologous fistula policy maximize use AVF AVG CVC AVF best long-term patency , few complication require less intervention fully maturate . Although implementation preoperative ultrasonography examination vessel assessment reduce number early AVF failure improve selection suitable vessel site AVF creation , short- long-term AVF dysfunction remain major cause morbidity hospitalisation HD patient , therefore major limitation HD treatment . This dysfunction usually associate non-maturation newly create AVF formation neo-intimal hyperplasia ( NIH ) potentially result decrease access flow eventual fistula thrombosis 50 % AVFs . On hand , low resistance vascular traject via AVF may lead impeded perfusion extremity distally AV anastomosis result hand ischemia ( HAIDI = Hemodialysis Access Induced Distal Ischemia ) , abundant AVF flow may lead development leave ventricular hypertrophy , potentially severe consequence . These high-flow complication occur approximately 20 % fistula . Numerous study investigate alternative preoperative mapping tool criterion reduction AVF related complication . However , current clinical use individual tool parameter take account potential interplay systemic level . Therefore one might consider multiple prognostic parameter within single patient likely valuable improve outcome therefore obvious tailor type AVF individual patient . A possible solution deal multiple independent prognostic factor implementation predictive patient-specific computational tool relate geometrical , mechanical hemodynamical parameter mean physical law . As result , computational tool take complex interplay different prognostic parameter consideration account individual difference anatomy , physiology , demography hemodynamics . Such innovative computational tool open new opportunity . By predict postoperative flow abovementioned deleterious event possibly prevent . High-flow ( &gt; 1500ml/min ) low-flow ( &lt; 600ml/min ) vascular access predict consequently reject suitable AVF-configuration chosen . Consequently , simulation outcome AVF creation hand . Recently , feasibility VA computational simulation investigate proven ARCH FP7 ICT-224390 project ( ARCH ; patient-specific image-based computational modeling improvement short- long- term outcome vascular access patient hemodialysis therapy ) . Within technological clinical study , longitudinal collection cardiovascular data perform intention develop , calibrate validate patient-specific modelling tool surgical plan assistance management complication arise AVF creation . Given difficult heterogeneous patient population , study protocol design way pre- postoperative imaging could perform strictly , aim complete datasets structural , functional demographical data . Although computational simulation model validate small patient group , large randomize observational patient study , aim evaluate potential beneficial effect use computational tool reduce AVF-related clinical problem , need .</detailed_description>
