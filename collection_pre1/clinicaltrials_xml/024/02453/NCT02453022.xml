	<brief_summary>The current study help increase understanding pharmacokinetics ( PK ) danirixin . The primary objective study estimate relative bioavailability danirixin Hydrobromide ( HBr ) tablet , compare danirixin free base ( FB ) . Safety tolerability information oral administration danrixin HBr tablets elderly subject also obtain . Secondarily , study evaluate effect food PK danirixin HBr , effect gastric acid suppression , within-subject PK variability danirixin HBr . The outcome study contribute selection appropriate formulation/dosing regimen future study . This open-label , 5-period crossover study . Study conduct 18 healthy elderly subject . Screening occur within 42 day prior Day 1 period 1 . The Treatment Periods separate washout period minimum 5 day . Follow-up do within 3 10 day post last dose .</brief_summary>
