	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose entinostat nivolumab give together ipilimumab treat patient solid tumor spread place body usually cure controlled treatment ( metastatic ) remove surgery ( unresectable ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node part body . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth ( locally advanced/metastatic ) . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab ipilimumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving entinostat nivolumab together ipilimumab may better treatment patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability combination entinostat nivolumab without ipilimumab subject advance solid tumor . II . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination entinostat nivolumab ipilimumab subject advance solid tumor confirm safety combination therapy subject advance HER2-negative breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether treatment entinostat alone combination nivolumab ipilimumab result increase ratio tumor antigen-specific effector T cell ( Teff ) regulatory T cell ( Treg ) tumor biopsy compare baseline . II . To describe preliminary anti-tumor activity entinostat nivolumab combination without ipilimumab patient advance solid tumor . III . To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity expansion cohort patient advance breast cancer treat RP2D . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore change immune-related biomarkers ( e.g. , expression checkpoint receptor ( program cell death 1 [ PD-1 ] /programmed cell death ligand-1 [ PD-L1 ] ) , number myeloid derive suppressor cell [ MDSCs ] , inflammatory T cell signature , T cell receptor [ TCR ] repertoire ) tumor biopsy peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) pre- post-therapy . II . To correlate change immune-related biomarkers pre- post-combination therapy response . III . To measure tumor-specific mutation mutant neo-antigens recognize patient T cell tumor biopsy describe association response . IV . To evaluate change frequency T cell recognize tumor-specific mutant neo-antigens peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) pre- post-therapy . V. To evaluate change candidate gene expression , include azacitidine ( AZA ) immune gene ( AIM gene ) malignant tissue , gene methylation silence circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) malignant tissue pre- post-therapy . VI . To correlate pharmacodynamic outcome ( e.g. , safety , efficacy , change gene methylation status ) exposure entinostat ( i.e. , pharmacokinetics ) co-administered nivolumab without ipilimumab . VII . To conduct pharmacogenomic association analyse assess potential clinical utility cluster differentiation ( CD ) 86 gene polymorphism genetic determinant immune mediate adverse event . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) day -14 -7 weekly , nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 every 2 week , ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 every 6 week 4 dos . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
