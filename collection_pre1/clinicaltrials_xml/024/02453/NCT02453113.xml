	<brief_summary>The purpose researcher use low power Near Infrared laser treatment non-painful non-damaging dose change skin properties.The researcher prove signal significant increase number skin cell skin tissue expose laser improve human skin immune system help improve human body response vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune-Related Trafficking Signaling Human Skin Associated With Low-Power , Infrared Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher use low power laser light one-minute exposure deliver skin non-painful non-damaging dose . The resulted significant immunologic change skin include up-regulation specific skin tissue skin gene activation mobilization specific skin cell . In first part study , researcher make determination laser irradiance tolerate . The high irradiance subject tolerate 1 minute identify subject 's maximum tolerable irradiance . After subject test , researcher select high irradiance tolerate use second phase study . Approximately 24 hour first test exposure , subject receive one minute laser treatment maximum tolerable irradiance . Four hour later , two skin biopsy collect laser treat site untreated . One tissue sample test UC Irvine Dept . Dermatopathology evaluate microscopic skin change , one skin sample deliver Massachusetts General Hospital evaluate RNA protein expression .</detailed_description>
