	<detailed_description>This single-arm open-label phase Ib phase II clinical study assess safety relative efficacy concurrent talimogene laherparepvec combination radiotherapy patient soft tissue sarcoma . Patients treat neoadjuvant radiation weekly intratumoral injection talimogene laherparepvec . Weekly injection talimogene laherparepvec continue surgery . Surgery perform 4-6 week end radiation therapy allow resolution acute toxicity per current standard care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject provide informed consent . 2 . Histologically confirm diagnosis locally advanced STS unresectable clear wide margin , preoperative radiotherapy consider appropriate . EXAMPLES : Resectable stage IIB , III , IV disease suitable surgically resection alone due inability achieve clear margin . Including metastatic ( stage IV ) disease radiotherapy surgical resection indicate . Except certain histologic subtypes : GIST , Desmoid , Ewing sarcoma , Kaposi sarcoma , bone sarcoma . 3 . Previous treatment : prior systemic anticancer treatment consist chemotherapy , immunotherapy , target therapy allow provided therapy complete least 1 year prior enrollment . No prior Talimogene laherparepvec tumor vaccine allow . No prior radiation tumor bed allow . 4 . Age ≥18 year . 5 . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . 6 . ECOG performance status ≤1 . 7 . Patient must measurable disease : Tumor size least ≥ 5 cm long diameter measure CT scan MRI radiation feasible . 7.1 Patient must injectable disease ( direct injection ultrasound guide ) . 1 . Certain histologic subtypes : GIST , Desmoid , Ewing sarcoma , Kaposi sarcoma , bone sarcomas 2 . History evidence sarcoma associate immunodeficiency state ( e.g . : Hereditary immune deficiency , HIV , organ transplant leukemia ) . 3 . Subjects retroperitoneal visceral sarcoma . 4 . History evidence gastrointestinal inflammatory bowel disease ( ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) symptomatic autoimmune disease include , inflammatory bowel disease , history poorly control severe systemic autoimmune disease ( i.e. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , type I diabetes , autoimmune vasculitis ) . 5 . History malignancy within past 3 year except treated curative intent know active disease present receive chemotherapy ≥ 1 year enrollment/randomization low risk recurrence . 6 . History prior current autoimmune disease . 7 . History prior current splenectomy splenic irradiation . 8 . Active herpetic skin lesion . 9 . Require intermittent chronic treatment antiherpetic drug ( e.g. , acyclovir ) , intermittent topical use . 10 . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease within 28 day prior enrollment treatment period . 11 . Concomitant treatment therapeutic anticoagulant warfarin . 12 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) disease ( require negative test clinically suspect HIV infection ) . 13 . Acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C infection ( require negative test clinically suspect hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Evidence hepatitis B Positive HBV surface antigen ( indicative chronic hepatitis B recent acute hepatitis B ) . Negative HBV surface antigen positive HBV total core antibody ( indicative resolve hepatitis B infection occult hepatitis B ) detectable copy HBV DNA PCR ( detectable HBV DNA copy suggest occult hepatitis B ) . Evidence hepatitis C Positive HCV antibody positive HCV RNA PCR ( undetectable RNA copy suggest past resolve hepatitis C infection ) . 14 . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding , plan become pregnant study treatment 3 month last dose study treatment . 15 . Female subject childbearing potential male subject unwilling use 2 highly effective method contraception study treatment 3 month last dose study treatment . 16 . Currently receive treatment another investigational device drug study , less 30 day since end treatment another investigational device drug study ( ) . 17 . Other investigational procedure participate study exclude . 18 . Subject previously enter study . 19 . Patients receive investigational agent . 20 . Evidence CNS metastasis . 21 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition talimogene laherparepvec . 22 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 23 .
