	<detailed_description>This mixed method pilot study build complete interview 13 participant 2012 ( Study 1 , S1 ) delivery community-based intervention 13 participant 2013 ( 2 day ; Study 2 , S2 ) . The propose research draw two study , S1 ( REB # H-05-12-04 ) S2 ( REB # H-05-12-04B ) , approve uOttawa REB . S2 include intervention one propose herein , compress format . It deliver Ottawa , positive feedback receive 13 participant . Administration intervention draw upon team member ' expertise ( Hamilton , Hack ) intervention people cancer , program research hope intervention , Thomas ' work woman breast cancer relate LE well S1 S2 . The intervention follow group-based workshop format . The intervention workshops offer weekly 8 session ( 2 hour per session , one per week ) . After introductory workshop , second session involve view video , create PI Thomas interview men woman lymphedema group discussion theme , base principle video model ( e.g. , participant ' experience , hope strategy compare ? ) . This approach use successfully area research marginalize people . Our program follow Herth 's theoretical foundation goal ( e.g. , identify support system , develop plan maintain hope future ) along establish approach supportive care chronic illnesses LE international best practice guideline . Briefly , workshops include module address building supportive community ; orient hope identify threat hope/coping ; positive self-talk affirmation ; creative practice explore experience hope ; identify mobilizing resource . The module also incorporate completion discussion creative project ( e.g. , write exercise ) , mini-lectures rehabilitation professional , SLC resource . All component review positively ( satisfactory ) majority participant S2 . All activity draw Herth 's intervention , prior research , success S2 . This content approve uOttawa REB , note previously . Four questionnaire administer IG/CG use assess potential impact intervention . Please see Study Protocol summary data collection . SUMMARY OF QUESTIONNAIRES 1 . The Meaning Illness Questionnaire , ( MIQ ) Factor II IV : Factor II address loss , stress , function . Factor IV address hope well positive attitude motivation . These 2 factor use screen participant prior study . The full version MIQ administer timepoints study begin , along questionnaire . 2 . The Herth Hope Index ( HHI ) 12-item ( 4 point ) Likert scale delineate 3 factor hope : ) temporality &amp; future , b ) positive readiness &amp; expectancy , c ) interconnectedness . ( 32 ) Summative score range 12-48 , high score denote great hope . The HHI pilot deem acceptable S2 . Participants encounter difficulty completion . 3 . Short Form 12 , ( SF-12 ) : QOL scale measure seven concept , include physical functioning , role limitation due health problem , social functioning . It short valid alternative SF 36 include psychological aspect illness ( e.g. , feeling energetic ) address instrument relevant S1 S2 participant ; 4 . Lymphedema Quality Life , LYMQOL : validated measure impact UL/LL LE . ( 110 ) The instrument include 28 UL item 27 LL item LE . Importantly , question address physical LE symptom , emotional impact , activity daily live . 5 . Demographic Symptoms Questionnaire - contain 16 question pertain age , family size , income employment , SLC symptom . This questionnaire administer T0 . DATA COLLECTION The IG meet weekly 2 hour 8 week . All workshop record transcribed , analyze qualitatively . The questionnaire ( Meaning Illness , MIQ ; Herth Hope Index , HHI ; Short Form 12 , SF-12 ; Lymphedema Quality Life , LYMQOL ) administer phone follow timepoints : approximately 3 day prior first workshop ( T0 ) , workshop 4 5 ( T1 ) approximately 3 day follow final workshop ( T2 ) . The questionnaire also administer 4 week post-intervention ( T3 ) 8 week ( T4 ) post-intervention . All participant also complete demographic questionnaire T0 , develop S2 . For Montreal site , intervention ( post intervention data collection ) administer Chad Hammond ( PhD , Psychology ) , postdoctoral fellow work extensively cancer survivor . For Saint John , qualify postdoctoral fellow hire Co-PI Hamilton University New Brunswick . Both trained Co-PIs . The CG receive LE treatment usual , without hope intervention . Participants ask refrain joining similar , group-based workshop duration intervention . The measure administer questionnaire ( phone ) IG timepoints . Montreal Saint John ( ethic approval obtain McGill U , UNB , Health Horizon ) select current proposal workshop already complete Ottawa ( S2 ) . At site ( Montreal Saint John ) potential participant ( n=46 ) screen eligibility base Factors II IV MIQ . The individual score top ~30 % ( n=16 ) term hope exclude study . The remain 30 individual score low level hope per MIQ admit study . This initial appraisal brief , conduct phone , therefore burdensome potential participant . The investigator choose administer full version MIQ ( instrument ) order screen efficiently avoid potential practice carryover effect administration outcome measure . Towers ( Montreal Co-I ) Tilley ( Saint John Co-I ) approach potential participant LE clinic names/contact information forward Dr. Chad Hammond , postdoctoral fellow ( PDF ) University Ottawa screen randomization IG CG . Questionnaires : S1 data prior SLC research informs selection hope main outcome measure , use HHI . EVALUATING THE INTERVENTION The impact intervention measure assessing change outcomes 2-month period . Questionnaires administer intake ( T0 ) , midpoint ( i.e. , workshop 4 5 , T1 ) , 3 day post-completion 8-week program ( T2 ) , 4 week post-intervention ( T3 ) , 8 week post-intervention ( T4 ) . All participant also complete demographic questionnaire ( T0 ) , develop S2 . IG data collect via phone timepoints . A workshop evaluation form also administer IG T2 . CG data collect phone timepoints ( however , workshop evaluation irrelevant CG collect ) . The follow-up period consistent study systematic review meta-analyses psychosocial intervention people cancer . Participants leave study early ask complete telephone exit interview explore moderate completion ( acceptability ) issue future program research . Notes interview compile part assessment feasibility . ASSESSING FEASIBILITY S2 use convenience sample , poster display clinician ' office . Based limited advertising result timely accrual investigator confident investigator achieve target 30 participant within 12 week investigator approach SLC patient directly 2 LE clinic ( Montreal , QC Saint John , NB ) . Using screening measure , investigator endeavour enroll equal number men woman well UL/LL . The # approach , # meet inclusion criterion , reason decline document . As pilot , investigator proceed intervention phase whether group represent equal number men/women upper limb ( UL ) /lower limb ( LL ) . However , data gather used inform adjustment might require future full trial . Consistent RCTs preparation full trial , participant flow diagram ( # assess eligibility , # exclude , # refuse participate , # randomize , # allocate IG CG , # lose follow-up , # discontinue , # analyze , # exclude analysis ) summarize statistic recruitment retention . Participants consider left intervention absent 25 % ( 2/8 ) workshop ask complete short exit interview telephone . To assess feasibility ( acceptability ) data collection , investigator address adherence timepoints barrier facilitator data collection . At conclusion pilot , impact intervention examine assessment timeline data determine whether timepoints feasible . If 50 % sample require 3 point contact ( phone and/or email ) schedule data collection , team modify study design subsequent proposal ( e.g. , increase # potential participant ) . Adherence timepoint data generate completion process log document date data collection participant well # point contact require schedule data collection . Descriptive statistic ( frequency , mean , SD ) generate assess feasibility timeline . Based data generate , timeline review adjusted necessary subsequent CIHR proposal . Survey completion rate calculate , % miss data note . To provide additional data acceptability , S2 , IG participant encourage write note hard copy survey ( 3 day prior Workshop 1 - T0 ; Intervention midpoint/between Workshop 4 5 - T1 ; Intervention completion/3 day follow Week 8 - T2 ) indicate issue . These data transcribe , compile , analyze . All data triangulate assess data collection feasibility .</detailed_description>
