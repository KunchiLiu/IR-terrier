	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate diagnostic ultrasound routinely perform human cause lung hemorrhage significant enough appear thoracic CT . The investigator ' hypothesis diagnostic lung ultrasound cause lung hemorrhage human . Damage lung animal model show mechanical rather thermal nature evidence suggest injury likely inertial cavitation alveolar resonance . Models alveolar resonance theory predict hemorrhage happen adult human lung ultrasound frequency high 1.69 MHz mechanical index ( MI ) less 1.9 maintain standard scan protocol thoracic ultrasound . A previous human study show gross macroscopic lung hemorrhage patient undergoing transesophageal echocardiography pressure 2.4 MPa MI 1.3 exposure duration range 7-68 minute . The investigator propose perform routine lung ultrasound exam patient schedule undergo chest compute tomography evaluation pulmonary embolus part routine care . The ultrasound perform immediately prior CT image marker place patient chest ensure correct lung tissue evaluate . There two sham marker radiologist blind tissue ultrasound apply . The CT scan evaluate per routine also see sign microscopic macroscopic hemorrhage skin marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational cohort study emergency department patient design assess radiographic change suggestive lung hemorrhage thoracic ultrasound . The investigator approach patient schedule CT scan part routine care emergency department enrollment . Only patient &gt; 18 year old . Patients english speaking consent medical interpreter immediately available approach informed consent . Patients give informed consent lung ultrasound perform study physician immediately prior CT scan - patient transport ED radiology area CT scan perform . The lung ultrasound perform use low frequency probe ( 2-5 MHz ) . Of four standard position use lung ultrasonography ( Zone 1 , 4 , 5 , 8 ; see Image 1 ) , study ultrasonography perform two . The two position select use choose immediately prior ultrasound performance perform physician use simple binary random number generator lung . This ensure one zone subject ultrasound lung . A small radio-opaque button place overlie four zone ( i.e. , expose expose ) standard position ultrasound footprint ( ie ultrasound would perform ) patient undergo CT scan accord standard radiology department protocol . The CT scan review sign alveolar hemorrhage lung tissue immediately adjacent radio-opaque button . Radiologists blind button abut zone expose ultrasound expose . Any finding immediately report patient 's care team patient standard protocol treatment observation follow . The investigator calculate need enroll 200 patient observe 7 % range previously publish number incidental finding chest CT scan .</detailed_description>
