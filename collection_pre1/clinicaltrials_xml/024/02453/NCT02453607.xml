	<brief_summary>In research proposal , investigator focus method optimize therapeutic response anti-TNF antibody , determine correlation 6-mp metabolite level IFX trough level , anti-IFX antibody level clinical response . The study also evaluate ( vitro ) possible impact vitamin D interaction IFX dendritic cell healthy subject patient Crohn 's disease ( proliferation , maturation , cytokine profile , apoptosis , gene expression ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite evidence beneficial effect thiopurine/IFX combine therapy prevention development anti-IFX antibody ( ATI ) improve clinical outcome , study employ proven clinical usefulness measure 6- MP metabolite level . We hypothesize target establish threshold 6-TGN level ( 235-400 ) , show result superior clinical efficacy , would reduce development ATI enhance trough IFX level . It also conceivable excessive6TGN level may increase risk adverse event infection neoplasms lymphomas , major drawback combination therapy . If significant correlation 6-TGN level diminish risk ATI development high trough serum IFX level demonstrate , allow improve approach towards pharmacological monitoring patient optimization long term response CD patient anti-TNF therapy . Vitamin D possess profound immunomodulatory effect , mediate primarily innate immune system . Low serum level vitamin D associate bad outcome CD . IFX report significant impact maturation phenotype dendritic cell ( DC ) . Previous work laboratory demonstrate significant effect vitamin D expression NOD2 along profound effect onthe cytokine profile DC expose PRR stimulation85 . We hypothesize vitamin Ddeficiency may associate low clinical response anti-TNF therapy . IFX vitamin D may synergistic effect modulate immune system IBD via interaction innate adaptive mechanism . We expect vitamin D may enhance IFX-induced shift maturation pathway cytokine profile DC expose intestinal microbe pattern recognition receptor ( PRR ) . Demonstration synergistic effect vitamin D anti-TNF antibody may important clinical implication care IBD patient , particularly Canada prevalence vitamin D deficiency high . Such effect demonstrate lymphocyte never examine innate immune system , consider profound role pathogenesis CD . The data study may provide justification need monitor vitamin D status CD patient , supplementation additional therapeutic tool optimize response anti-TNF CD . This prospective cross-sectional longitudinal multicentre non-interventional study . The patient recruit follow center : McGill University Health Center , Mount Sinai Medical Centre , Toronto , Canada ; University Calgary , U Alberta , Edmonton . This study recruit patient ( 18-70 yr ) Crohn 's disease start treatment infliximab combo therapy infliximab azathiopurine . This study look therapeutic monitoring end point evaluate impact drug level antibody clinical effectiveness treatment ( mono combo therapy ) . .</detailed_description>
