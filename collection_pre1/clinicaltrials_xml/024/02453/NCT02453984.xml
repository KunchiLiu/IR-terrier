	<detailed_description>The Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD1 ) /Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) axis important immune checkpoint T cell activation use tumor evade host immune response . Blocking signal PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A result ongoing T cell activity induce durable tumor regression across numerous solid tumor type . PD-L1 express tumor cell also immune cell , activate vascular endothelial cell immune privilege site eye . An obstacle use PD-L1 expression predictive biomarker might potential heterogeneous expression fast dynamic . For PD1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition PD-L1 tumor surface expression , positive 40-100 % melanoma patient 35-95 % non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient , propose potential biomarker . In early clinical trial , PD-L1 expression associate response PD1/PD-L1 inhibition . However , clinical trial report response PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor 47 % PD-L1-negative melanoma assess single biopsy . In bladder cancer weak strong PD-L1 expression report 30 % patient , however also response PD-L1-negative patient see . For triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) little know , early response data also promise . Radio-labeling MPDL3280A positron emission tomography ( PET ) radionuclide Zirconium-89 ( 89Zr ) enable non-invasive image quantification PD-L1 distribution cancer patient . By perform 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET scan prior treatment MPDL3280A , uptake tracer primary metastatic tumor lesion normal organ distribution evaluate , well use 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET complementary tool patient selection future .</detailed_description>
