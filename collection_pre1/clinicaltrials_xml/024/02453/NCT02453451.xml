	<brief_summary>Patients receive MitraClip procedure leakiness mitral valve . During procedure atrioventricular valve stick together permanently via clip lead reduction leakiness . As result procedure small hole remain cardiac septum call atrial septal defect ( ASD ) . In case hole close week month , many case . Until exact data effect hole filling pressure heart blood flow behaviour . So aim study precise analysis blood flow mechanic MitraClip procedure identify criterion get information well strategy regulation MitraClip procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The percutaneous mitral valve reconstruction ( PMVR ) use MitraClip system become establish therapeutic alternative patient symptomatic mitral regurgitation high operative risk . The MitraClip technology represent catheter-based non-surgical procedure metal cramp ( clip ) transport place defective mitral valve . At time , occur also 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram ( 3D-TEE ) transseptal puncture control procedure . After removal guide catheter new atrial septal defect develop close spontaneously week month . In study criterion standardize evaluation effect new ASD hemodynamic parameter - MitraClip procedure - shall validate first time . The investigator expect obtain new finding exact analysis newly form ASD planning , regulation follow-up mitral insufficiency treatment .</detailed_description>
