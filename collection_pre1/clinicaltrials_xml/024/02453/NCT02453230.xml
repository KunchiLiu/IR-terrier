	<detailed_description>Since 1960 's , perinatal mortality United States decline steady rate . This decline think result improved surveillance normal abnormal fetal behavior use information determine baby risk stillbirth . There many tool available surveillance . One tool , bio-physical profile ( BPP ) , incorporate non-stress test ( NST ) ultrasound assessment fetal behavior . This test use last 30 year good safety efficacy . The ultrasound evaluation include monitoring fetal breathing , fetal gross fine movement amniotic fluid evaluation . NST BPP find similar ability predict fetal well-being , similar safety ease performance . Several study observe effect sound well light NST find shorten testing time without alter ability interpret properly affect fetal safety . However , similar study do BPP . Light stimulation proven safe mother fetus harm demonstrate use NST . Since 1960 's , perinatal mortality United States decline steady rate . This decline think result improve surveillance well neonatal infant care . However , still large percentage mortality relate antenatal fetal maternal complication . There much research area , help predict fetus likely poor outcome , may benefit intervention , early delivery . Several test develop help monitor fetal behavior differentiate fetal well-being identify risk adverse outcome . Some test include contraction-stress test ( CST ) bio-physical profile ( BPP ) , incorporate NST ultrasound assessment fetal behavior . These test accurately reflect acid-base status fetus well level fetal oxygenation . The biophysical profile originally develop method assess fetal health help determine whether complication pregnancy severe enough warrant delivery . The time length need complete biophysical profile variable . The test consider complete fetus meet criterion . The test consist four ultrasound component , electronic fetal monitoring component : fetal heart rate reactivity non-stress test , fetal breathing movement , fetal gross body movement , fetal tone/posture amniotic fluid evaluation . These component score `` 2 '' present `` 0 '' present . This make maximum score 10 . Scores 8 great generally consider reassuring . A score 6 consider equivocal require evaluation follow-up . A score 4 concern delivery plan initiate soon . A score 2 0 mean fetus deliver immediately . Fetal heart rate reactivity assess fetal non-stress test use external electronic fetal monitor . The mother external tocodynomometer small doppler device place area fetal chest place abdomen . The test consider `` reactive '' two define acceleration fetal heart rate baseline rate 20 30 minute test period . The size acceleration require depend gestational age fetus . Testing time extend 60 minute obtain reactivity fetus happen passive sleep state test . Fetal breathing movement see ultrasound begin early second trimester . The consist intermittent `` practice '' breathe fetus diaphragm see move similarly adult . These movement last great 30 second continuous . This first finding lose fetal hypoxemia present . Body limb movement generally decrease fetus hypoxic . This correspond decreased activity level metabolic conservation fetus compromise . Three discrete movement require consider present . Fetal tone posture demonstration active extension rapid return flexion fetal limb brisk reposition trunk rotation . Opening close hand mouth , kicking , . One example must observe consider present exam . Amniotic fluid evaluation consider present least one pocket fluid see ultrasound measure great 2 centimeter without umbilical cord present . Response fetus light stimulation know since 1975 Polishuk report fetal movement 26 week gestation fetus stimulate light . In 1980 , Peleg Goldman perform amnioscopy note acceleration fetal heart rate 80 % patient expose light amnioscope . Caridi et al . noted fetus stimulate halogen light take less time become reactive non-stress test fetus stimulate . No study note adverse maternal fetal event use light stimulation .</detailed_description>
