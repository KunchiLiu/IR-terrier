	<brief_summary>Background The treatment haemophilia A B revolutionize use factor concentrate , prophylaxis treat bleed episode ( on-demand treatment ) . However , despite advantage , repeat treatment factor concentrate lead development inhibitor ( antibody ) towards coagulation factor concentrate . Another patient group bleed symptom difficult treat inhibitor towards coagulation factor , commonly FVIII , patient acquire haemophilia . Patients high antibody titer exhibit deficient response factor concentrate usually need treatment bypass agent , namely factor eight inhibitor bypass agent ( FEIBA速 , Baxter ) och recombinant activate factor VII ( rFVIIa , Novo-Seven速 , Novo Nordisk ) . The effect treatment accurately monitor traditional coagulation test . The aim study evaluate utility global haemostatic method patient haemophilia inhibitor . The objective improve monitoring treatment effect thus increase safety patient effectiveness treatment . Patients method Patients The primary cohort consist fifteen patient inherit haemophilia inhibitor well five adult patient acquire haemophilia follow Coagulation Department Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden . Blood sample collect patient specific time point ( see Design study ) course two year ( patient ) . The treatment ( type , dose , duration ) determine treat physician . Methods ( selection ) - Thrombin generation ( Calibrated Automated Thrombogram , CAT速 commercial kit Siemens速 ) . - Overall haemostatic potential ( OHP ) Design study Timeframe blood sampling : ) baseline ( inclusion study ) , ii ) prior administration bypass agent either treat bleeding symptom invasive procedure prophylaxis . Data analysis The variation coagulation marker measure describe ( Methods ) associate clinical symptom ( bleed ) , level coagulation factor ( measurable ) titer inhibitor .</brief_summary>
