	<brief_summary>Recently , several article suggest report Adductor Canal Blocks ( ACBs ) offer adequate equal analgesia may promote good performance early rehabilitation follow Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) compare commonly used Femoral Nerve Block ( FNB ) . A common feature study use moderate high concentration local anesthetic ( e.g . 0.2 % 0.5 % Ropivacaine respectively ) inject large motor nerve inevitably cause weakness . However , practice institution long continuous femoral nerve block ( CFNB ) low concentration local anesthetic ( 0.0625 % Bupivacaine ) . Over past several year investigator perform several thousand CFNBs use technique offer advantage minimal motor weakness adequate analgesia . The primary goal study determine establish practice use low concentration continuous FNB insert 5cm caudal groin crease ( apex femoral triangle ) use low infusion rate 2ml/hr comparable emerge practice insert Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block ( CPNB ) anatomic adductor canal ( AC ) - infuse 4ml/hr . A secondary goal study effect cumulative volume local anesthetic infuse FNB rate 2ml/hr compare rate 4ml/hr 48-hour postoperative period . Definitions location adductor canal debate heavily literature , seem agree middle 1/3 thigh contains proximal AC distal 1/3 thigh contains adductor hiatus - terminal end AC . Our study require placement continuous ACB distal 20cm cephalad superior pole patella due placement prior surgery need keep dress operative field . The CACB catheter also place proximal 20cm distal ASIS . In addition exclusion criterion , measurement create exclusion patient iliac-to-patella distance less 40cm . Iliac Patella distance ( IPD ) measure pre-operative interview day surgery measuring tape . External palpable landmark Anterior superior iliac spine superior pole patella use . The primary outcome base upon ability perform rehabilitation exercise postoperatively extent criterion discharge meet . The primary outcome measure time patient gain ability successfully perform 75-feet unassisted walk . On Day Surgery ( DOS ) , prior walk attempt , secondary outcome measure perform 5-second sustained straight leg raise . Other secondary outcome number day admit prior discharge , average pain score DOS , POD # 1 , POD # 2 . The Day discharge also use secondary outcome . Earlier discharge become goal almost healthcare system minimize cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Adductor Canal Blocks Vs. Low Dose Femoral Nerve Blocks For Early Rehabilitation After Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three arm follow : 1 . The control group ; Continuous Femoral Nerve Block - Low Dose ( CFNB-LD ) patient randomize standard therapy comprise low dose/concentration Continuous Femoral Nerve Block insert approximately 5cm distal groin crease rate 2ml/hr . 2 . Higher dose ( HD ) CFNB ; - block place location CFNB-LD high dose rate 4ml/hr . This high rate could afford pain control may cause quadriceps hip flexor weakness . 3 . Continuous Adductor Canal Block ( CACB ) group catheter insert 20-30cm proximal superior pole patella , infusion rate 4ml/hr , similar dress make appear like group 1 2 . Acute Pain/Regional anesthesiologists fellows perform research procedure locations investigator routinely perform regional nerve block : preoperative hold area adjacent operating room suit University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) - Passavant . All three group set rate increase . There also bolus order give floor , however IV PO medication available decrease discomfort . These medication order give upon request ( PRN ) ; upon patient request . Down-regulation dos also allow would cause uncertainty regimen may contribute postoperative weakness . The adjustment allow turn nerve block infusion completely POD # 1 dense motor block quadriceps iliopsoas ( hip flexor ) exist , condition facilitate participation rehabilitation exercise . The frequency early-removal nerve block record three group . CFNB group Continuous Femoral Nerve Block placement : The skin right leave groin sterilize drape sterile condition , femoral nerve identify use ultrasound inguinal crease local anesthetic infiltrate subcutaneously . The needle inserted lateral edge probe direct toward nerve use ultrasound assistance . When proximity nerve , 15ml 0.2 % ropivacaine inject needle repeat aspiration every 5 ml . The nerve block catheter place 3-5 cm past needle tip secure steri strip bio-occlusive dressing . CACB group Continuous Adductor Canal Block placement : The distance ASIS superior pole patella measure distance record . This Iliac-to-Patella distance ( IPD ) divide proximal distal half , halfway point mark . The length IPD need minimum 40cm inclusion . The insertion site need 20cm proximal superior pole patella least 20ml distal ASIS . The attend anesthesiologist / acute pain attend either perform supervise regional anesthesia fellow place CACB proximal halfway mark IPD . For example , patient IPD 50cm , halfway mark 25cm would site insertion would within anatomic adductor canal would adequately remove surgical site . The skin right leave anterior-medial thigh sterilize drape sterile condition . The sartorius muscle femoral artery identify ultrasound mark IPD-halfway-mark . There , local anesthetic infiltrate subcutaneously . The needle inserted direction hyperechoic nerve hypoechoic femoral artery use ultrasound assistance . When needle tip deep sartorius proximity artery , 15ml 0.2 % ropivacaine inject needle repeat aspiration every 5 ml . The nerve catheter place 3-5 cm past needle tip secure steri-strips bio-occlusive dressing . The CACB rate 4ml/hr bupivacaine 0.0625 % . By design , Observers aware singular kind patient ; CPNBs . The dress cACB similar CFNB standard yellow connector piece secure skin bio-occlusive covering , location level anterior superior iliac spine ( ASIS ) . This standardized dressing serve aid blind observer kind continuous block patient receive . Labeling catheter dress differ . The nerve block billing record contain information particular approach use . Sciatic nerve block placement : corresponding right leave gluteal area sterilize drape sterile condition , sciatic nerve identify ultrasound low gluteal region local anesthetic infiltrate subcutaneously . A trans-gluteal approach use inject normal saline needle assist catheter placement ; catheter introduce 3-5 cm past needle tip secure steri strip tegaderm . No local anesthetic administer postoperative period .</detailed_description>
