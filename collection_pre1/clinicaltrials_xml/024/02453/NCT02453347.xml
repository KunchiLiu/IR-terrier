	<detailed_description>Veterans conflict Afghanistan Iraq exhibit numerous signature injury include posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , anxiety . These three condition commonly co-occur together , present treatment challenge . First , current treatment guideline focus treat condition individually sufficiently account comorbid presentation .

Second , treat anxiety among Veterans comorbid PTSD TBI involve medication may limit efficacy ( e.g. , PTSD medication ) side effect ( e.g. , drug interaction diminish cognitive function ) . Given treatment challenge , Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation ( CES ) may serve effective complimentary , noninvasive/non-pharmacological treatment Veteran population .

Additionally , Department Defense ( DoD ) Veterans Health Affairs ( VHA ) prescribe CES treat trauma-related condition .

A meta-analysis performed CES study two decade ago find evidence CES treatment sham group , study review miss data study personnel always blind group . Additionally , CES show significant improvement anxiety symptom CES therapy 12 adult patient diagnose generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ; Bystritsky et al. , [ 2008 ] ) . The success CES treat anxiety may indicate suitable signal exploring use PTSD sample ( Novakovic et al . [ 2011 ] ) . Given relatively CES study available scholarly literature , 2009 Cochrane Systematic Review find insufficient evidence support use CES manage persistent TBI symptom . While study encourage , device clearly demonstrate effective multi-morbid OEF/OIF/OND Veteran population . Additionally , little information know mechanism action CES .</detailed_description>
