	<brief_summary>Although exercise know delay cognitive decline decrease risk Alzheimer 's Disease , lack understanding exercise protects age brain . The propose research take novel approach problem test concept acute , direct effect exercise brain region affect chronic exercise training . If investigator successful , acute paradigm allow u determine critical exercise parameter modulate brain function human use single exercise dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given rise proportion old adult worldwide progressive decline brain function advance age , press need develop novel intervention protect age brain . The predominant approach implement exercise training improve brain function increase cardiovascular fitness . However , mixed empirical support effectiveness approach . Further , also acute effect exercise within one hour cessation single exercise session . These effect occur adaptation related fitness could occur animal study show occur brain region benefit longer-term exercise training . Therefore , investigator propose acute paradigm tool probe early , direct response exercise order determine best maximize long-term benefit exercise training age brain . This present critical need determine mechanistic relation acute long-term effect exercise age brain . Our long-term goal determine exercise protect brain adverse effect age . In turn , specific objective R21 proposal support refute concept single session exercise produce acute increase functional synchrony clinically relevant brain network related accrue exercise-training effect brain system . Our central hypothesis effect moderate intensity exercise increase functional synchrony hippocampus Default Mode Network , Prefrontal Cortex Fronto-Executive Network , fashion 12-week moderate intensity exercise training program . This hypothesis base data show acute effect exercise factor related neuronal plasticity excitability brain region show long-term effect exercise animal . The contribution propose research significant determine extent acute exercise paradigm provide insight regular exercise protects brain adverse effect age . The propose research innovative first time investigator examine overlap neural system outcomes associate acute chronic exercise individual . Overall , success project enable future research study vary exercise parameter mode intensity affect exercise-induced change brain function timecourse effect , well neurobiological mechanism associate direct effect exercise age brain .</detailed_description>
