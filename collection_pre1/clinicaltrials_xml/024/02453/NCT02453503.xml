	<detailed_description>Introduction OLP chronic inflammatory disease frequently involve oral mucosa . Clinical symptom OLP various white keratotic lesion without pain erosion painful injury ( 1 ) . OLP episodic symptom range pain irritation mouth affect normal function cause physical mental pressure patients.OLP see two main form reticular erosive . Erosive OLP see injured Arytmatozo enclose keratotic stria .These lesion often follow episodic symptom pain irritation severe discomfort cause major negative impact performance oral system l quality life .So , aware Clinical symptom management lesion important clinician . ( 4,3,2,1 ) Although , lesion rarely life-threatening , discomfort pain associate abnormal caloric intake lead nervosa , dehydrate short order malnutrition . It also increase risk infection reduce quality life patient greatly. ( 2,3 ) . The main treatment symptomatic OLP prescribe systemic topical corticosteroid . ( 1,3 ) strong type like triamcinolone increasingly use treatment OLP ( 4 ) . Lichen planus chronic mucocutaneous disease relatively common middle-aged affected 2- 0.2 % population . Men woman almost equally affected . In mouth , white bilatera lesion sometimes cause wound The common clinical pattern linear ( 9-5 ) .There limit study frequency clinical form OLP . It mention Esmaeili etal study patient men fourth decade common Hypertrophic classic type type reticular oral lesion prevalent ( 10 ) another study Khalili etal report common form clinical lesion ulcerated lesion average time spend 18.4 month , commonly involve mucosa buccal tongue gum .White spot , line Wickham mucosal erythema common clinical feature lesion ( 11 ) . There currently cure OLP . The main focus treatment reduce duration severity symptom . The common acceptable treatment symptomatic OLP lesion systemic corticosteroid topical modulate host immune response .In mild moderate lesion main treatment topical corticosteroid clobetasol gel , betamethasone gel triamcinolone ointment ( 2 , 3 , 12 ) . Due persistence drug site lesion may use new dosage form mucoadhesive tablet film . Films mucoadhesive drug delivery system use manufacture mucoadhesive polymer receive considerable attention recent year .The film attach oral wound healing cause reduce pain inflammatory disease . ( 4 , 13 ) The Licorice plant use traditional medicine treatment aphthous ulcer , gastric ulcer , hepatitis C , cough , Asthma , Addison skin disease . Clinical pharmacology study show herb also contain beneficial anti-inflammatory component , antiviral antibacterial , antioxidant , anticancer modify immune system .Licorice contain provision , glycyrrhetinic acid glycyrrhizin help heal wound ( 14,15,16 ) In 2008 , Martin et al . examined effect oral patch contain licorice extract ( Licorice ) treatment aphthous ulcer find positive effect size lesion patient 's report pain . ( 15 ) Chan et al. , investigated palliative treatment patient symptomatic OLP steroid , Cyclosporine topical retinoid systematic review conclude weak evidence superiority treatment compare placebo . The author also express several study face restriction various compound potentially useful result OLP . Conducted study enough strong , control group small , make blind researcher patient n't make error design study . There would special need statistically powerful study order determine value new compound prevention treatment mucositis . ( 17 ) The purpose study find way reduce pain inflammation patient symptomatic OLP On one hand reduce risk infection , reduce need pain medication ultimately improve quality life use triamcinolone mucoadhesive film licorice group patient . Methods material : This study clinical trial randomize double-blind . Sampling do randomly Patients symptomatic OLP refer Oral Medicine School Dentistryin Medical Sciences Isfahan University participate voluntarily.. In study , patient symptomatic OLP 18 year men non-pregnant woman enrol study . All patient examine dental Prophylaxis oral hygiene recommendation compliance oral health do patient . After fill write consent , patient divide two group randomly : first group I ( n = 30 ) treat triamcinolone Mucoadhesive film second group ( n = 30 ) treat licorice mucoadhesive film . All patient underwent complete dental examination diagnosis patient oral lichen planus lesion initially mark physical examination conduct interviewing patient confirm histologic evaluation .The duration treatment recovery lesion two week weekly visit . The Triamcinolone Mucoadhesive film 1 mg prepare provide patient one group . And another group give licorice mucoadhesive film Afnogel brand name .The drug dose determine three time day meal bed time patient put upper part gum eat wash mouth patient common function like talk eat drinking within release drug . Severity recovery rate lesion measure visit accordance criterion set Buajeeb etal ( 18 ) 0 5 degree .The rate pain patient create Mucositis assess ruler VAS method give number 0 10 accord rate pain . Injury burning , pain waking , eating , drinking , talk , pain swallowing , dry mouth , tingle numbness take studied medication use product contain caffeine , tobacco , alcohol questionnaire register patient .The compliance patient evaluate base return mucoadhesive end week base number patient ' visit physician . The patient withdraw study reason , pregnancy , drug interaction , compliance le 70 % patient take medicine do refer doctor .All case collect analyzed Mann-Whitney test .</detailed_description>
