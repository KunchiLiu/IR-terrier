	<brief_summary>Many patient risk suicide discharge ED little intervention . Evidence-based suicide prevention intervention , like universal screen safety planning adopt clinical practice help prevent suicidal behavior . This study test long-term sustainability nurse administer universal screen implemented original ED-SAFE study . Also , investigator test impact implement new personalize Safety Planning Intervention guide Lean suicide composite outcome . The ED-SAFE-2 use step wedge design original eight ED-SAFE site collect quantitative qualitative data three phase : Baseline , Implementation , Maintenance . Using data , well data original ED-SAFE study , ED-SAFE-2 examine within site difference exist screen practice new safety planning procedure . Most data collection outcomes do retrospective chart review . The Safety Plan Intervention adopt routine clinical care patient screen positive set discharge . Each step present clinician response record templated form . After completion safety plan , clinician help patient identify helpful aspect plan , ascertain likelihood actually use , address potential barrier use . The patient keep safety plan use reminder time escalate distress crisis . A Lean Implementation Strategy use ensure adoption intervention fully support vertically horizontally within organization , infrastructure build support effort , protocol fit naturally within role , responsibility , clinical flow . Consistent RFA 's emphasis , intervention target clinician 's behavior safety planning . All emergency mental health nursing personnel site train safety planning , Lean use help ensure safety planning implement properly consistently . The mechanisms action combination safety plan train Lean study , allow team establish effect intervention intervention target also mechanisms action comprise departmental culture change infrastructure support .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emergency Department Safety Assessment Follow-up Evaluation 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suicide risk much prevalent among general emergency department ( ED ) patient general community risk often go undetected , especially among patient present non-psychiatric complaint . By definition , universal screen way identify occult risk among patient present non-psychiatric complaint . Until recently , however , little known implement universal screen clinical ED set whether effect detect risk . The ED-SAFE show feasible implement universal screen screening increase detection suicide risk . Simply identify risk sufficient ; effort must take mitigate risk prevent suicidal behavior . However , many study show even patient identify clinically significant risk often discharge home without receive kind active intervention ED visit , many even receive psychiatric evaluation.1-3 Brief intervention good fit ED need . One intervention receive strong research support already accept best practice United States Department Veterans Affairs : Safety Planning Intervention.4 This intervention , however , adopt civilian EDs little know effectively implement , whether impact suicide-related outcome . This study address follow specific aim : Aim 1 : Test long-term sustainability nurse administer universal screen implement original study across two new time period . ( ) The first period original ED-SAFE new study ( ED-SAFE-2 ) , represent ecologically valid `` natural '' state without grant support , hereafter refer Baseline . ( b ) The second Maintenance phase new study , represent time period span minimum four year screen initially implement . • Primary hypothesis : Sites sustain high screening rate ( intervention target ) sustain improve suicide risk detection ( patient outcome ) time period examine . Sustained screening practice mediate ED organizational characteristic enable infrastructure ( mechanisms action ) . Aim 2 : Test impact implement new personalize Safety Planning Intervention patient suicide risk discharge ED . • Primary hypothesis : Clinician training safety planning , combine implementation guide Lean , expect increase safety planning clinician ( intervention target ) , result reduce suicide suicide-related acute healthcare 6-months post-visit ( suicide composite outcome ) . This likely sit organizational characteristic infrastructure support safety planning ( mechanisms action ) . Aim 3 : Test sustainability safety plan Maintenance phase . • Primary hypothesis : Sustained safety plan result sustain reduction suicide composite outcome . Sustained safety planning mediate strong organizational characteristic robust enable infrastructure support safety planning .</detailed_description>
