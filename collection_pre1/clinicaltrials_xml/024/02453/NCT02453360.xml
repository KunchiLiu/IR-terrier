	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) associate large amount postoperative pain . This pain oftentimes severe enough limit participation physical therapy ultimately delay discharge result increased cost . Several strategy develop effort decrease postoperative pain follow TKA maintain low extremity strength maximize participation physical therapy . Recently , adductor canal blockade gain popularity report provide analgesia anterior knee without result significant quadriceps muscle weakness . However , study carefully evaluate impact volume injection local anesthetic adductor canal motor weakness pain control . The ability achieve similar pain control decrease volumes local anesthetic would allow surgery team apply local anesthetic posterior knee structure . Decreased volumes local anesthetic may also associate decrease risk local anesthetic toxicity . This study aim carefully evaluate relationship use physical therapy evaluation method relies motor strength pain control . In addition , investigator hope carefully evaluate motor strength use novel method strength measurement effort evaluate impact volume injection local anesthetic adductor canal motor strength .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative analgesia total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) incredibly important allows effective physical therapy ultimately ensure proper function implant joint hardware . Unfortunately , TKA oftentimes associate pain severe enough limit participation physical therapy ultimately result prolonged hospitalization perhaps decrease joint function . A number strategy report decrease pain associate TKA . Opioids commonly utilize associated number potential side effect include nausea , itching , respiratory depression , tolerance potential abuse . Epidural analgesia utilized postoperative analgesia strategy require urinary catheterization ( potential source increase incidence urinary tract infection ) , cause significant vasodilation result hypotension cause bilateral low extremity weakness undermine effort early physical therapy rehabilitation . Femoral nerve blockade femoral nerve catheter potential decrease pain anterior knee use technique limit incomplete analgesia quadriceps motor weakness . Some group advocate substitution addition sciatic obturator nerve block femoral nerve blockade expense increase low extremity weakness little potential clinical benefit.1-5 In effort balance need effective postoperative analgesia need maintain low extremity muscle strength active participation physical therapy , number group begin evaluate adductor canal block . The adductor canal locate middle 1/3 thigh include saphenous nerve nerve vastus medialis . The primary advantage adductor canal blockade versus femoral nerve blockade potential sparing nerve quadriceps muscle therefore preservation low extremity motor strength.6-8 Kwofie et al report study 16 volunteer change quadriceps strength hip adduction follow injection 15 ml local anesthetic . This interesting obturator nerve report travel within adductor canal responsible hip adduction . Kwofie et al also report SSACNB result significantly decreased impairment balance compare SSFNB.9 To point , majority study evaluate adductor canal blockade focus continuous technique little do evaluate single shot technique . Continuous technique potential extend analgesia expense increase cost , effort , resource utilization potentially increase risk infection . The safety CACNB technique highlight study Henningsen et al case nerve injury relate analgesic technique report series 97 patients.10 Andersen et al compare CACNB v control 40 patient find intervention group report decreased pain sleep disturbance retain ability ambulate soon surgery.11 Mudumbai et al evaluate 180 patient undergoing TKA discover continuous adductor canal nerve blockade ( CACNB ) relative continuous femoral nerve blockade ( CFNB ) result great ability ambulate ( 37 vs 6 ) POD 1 similar pain scores.8 Jaeger et al examine similar group 54 patient present TKA find CACNB relative CFNB result decreased quadriceps weakness difference pain , opioid consumption weakness.12 Jenstrup et al report , compare placebo , CACNB result decreased pain flexion opioid consumption.13 Only recently study compare SSACNB SSFNB publish . This study demonstrate SSACNB result decreased postoperative quadriceps weakness similar pain control SSFNB.14 Of interest , previous research demonstrate 15 ml 0.5 % ropivacaine require produce ultrasound guide femoral nerve blockade ( include sensory quadriceps motor weakness ) study yet do adductor canal block.15 It possible large volume local anesthetic inject adductor canal could result proximal spread local anesthetic increase quadriceps weakness difficulty ambulate . It also possible decrease volume injection may result inferior pain control difficulty participate physical therapy .</detailed_description>
