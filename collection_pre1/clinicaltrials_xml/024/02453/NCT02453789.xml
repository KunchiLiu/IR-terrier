	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To explore efficacy inhale OligoG reduce microbial burden Burkholderia spp . measure expectorated sputum sample . Secondary objective : To explore effect inhale OligoG various efficacy variable lung function , Quality-of-Life , rheology microbiological outcome measure . To evaluate safety , tolerability subject compliance treatment The study also evaluate effect inhale OligoG various efficacy variable lung function , Quality-of-Life , rheology microbiological outcome measure , evaluate safety patient compliance treatment .</detailed_description>
