	<brief_summary>Even slight reduction serious complication relate blood pressure management would easily justify cost relatively rare complication consequent arterial catheter insertion . However , seem unlikely major outcome improve presumably slight difference hemodynamic control result continuous blood pressure measurement rather measurements 2-5-minute interval . There considerable variation practice clear consensus whether arterial line place , especially ASA 2 patient undergoing major non-cardiac surgery ASA-3 patient undergo moderate major non-cardiac surgery . Clearly , benefit outcome , arterial line , invasive costly , place routinely . The investigator therefore propose test primary hypothesis use arterial catheter decrease risk collapse composite in-hospital mortality , re-admissions , MINS , AKI , stroke , respiratory wound heal gastro-intestinal complication non-cardiac surgery . Secondarily , investigator propose test hypothesis arterial catheter use : 1 ) decrease duration hospitalization ; 2 ) increase blood gas , electrolyte , coagulation testing ; 3 ) increase induction-to-incision time ; , 4 ) increase cost-of-care ( supply , , blood test , induction-to-incision time ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct Cleveland Clinic Main Campus IRB approval write consent participate patient . The investigator enroll consent ASA Physical Status 2-4 patient inpatient non-cardiac surgery radial arterial catheter might might reasonably use base co-morbidity type surgery . However , likely majority patient ASA 3 patient . Currently ( base recent data pull ) approximately 44 % ASA 3 patient receive arterial catheter non-cardiac surgery . The investigator expect insertion rate remain constant throughout study . Aside randomize assignment arterial catheter use , aspect anesthetic perioperative management control . When attend anesthesiologist exclude otherwise qualify patient study , investigator ask designate factor influence decision . Potential reason include : 1 ) type procedure ; 2 ) co-morbidities ; 3 ) expect hemodynamic instability blood loss ; 4 ) patient position ; , 5 ) need blood sample . Demographic data obtain include height ( cm ) , weight ( kg ) , age ( yr. ) , gender , ASA physical status , self-declared ethnicity . If available investigator collect social history ( tobacco alcohol use ) , medical history ( pulmonary disease , cardiovascular disease , neurologic disease , drug usage ( include limit : statin , ß blocker , oral hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin ) , NSAIDs , diabetes ( whether insulin-dependent ) , previous glucose-tolerance test result , preoperative hemoglobin hematocrit , BUN creatinine , electrolytes , preoperative EKG , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) . Anesthetic data include volatile anesthetic dose MAC-hours , well total dos propofol sedative hypnotic . Hemodynamic , respiratory parameter , BIS value ( available ) distal esophageal temperature record 10 minute interval intraoperatively . Blood loss estimate ; urine output fluid administration include allergenic blood record . Intraoperative use total dose vasoactive drug well antibiotic administration record . The investigator also record duration anesthesia well time induction anesthesia surgical incision . Similar data record patient potentially qualify excluded randomization attend anesthesiologist . Serum troponin creatinine determine postoperative day 1 , 2 3 hospital . Blood drawn conjunction routine laboratory test . The surgical team notify troponin value ≥0.03 ng/ml identify . All study data obtain medical record , include patient characteristic , type surgery , perioperative blood transfusion , mean-arterial pressure , vasopressor use , number blood gas coagulation test , duration hospitalization , postoperative complication well readmission .</detailed_description>
