	<brief_title>Analysis CRBSI Rates Patients With NexSite™ HD ( Hemodialysis ) Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This U.S. multi - centre , prospective , non-randomized post approval registry . Approximately one hundred twenty patient implant NexSite HD catheter four eight U.S. sit hemodialysis catheter routinely implant . Each site may enrol maximum 50 patient . Enrolled patient follow device placement device removal 180 day post device placement . Patients enrol . The primary endpoint CRBSI rate relate NexSite HD catheter . Determination infection decide investigator necessary adjudicate CEC ( Clinical Events Committee ) base blood culture result , regardless whether catheter remove . Secondary endpoint study - Successful placement continue use NexSite HD device design use patient require long term hemodialysis . - Healing catheter exit site - Tunnel Infections - Exit site infection - Early non-infectious complication associate CVCs - Late non-infectious complication associated Central Venous Catheters</detailed_description>
