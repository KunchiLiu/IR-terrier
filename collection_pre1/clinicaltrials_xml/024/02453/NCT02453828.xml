	<brief_summary>Perioperative management decision must often make quickly rely practitioner relevant fact hand . During transition patient care anesthesia provider , know `` handover , '' information may completely faithfully communicate , consequently impair provider 's ability intervene correctly response subsequent event . Checklists consistently proven effective enhance communication handover , whether anesthesia checklist improve patient outcomes yet prove . The investigator propose randomize intraoperative anesthesia provider handover standard practice ( specific format ) handover checklist present decision-support system conjunction investigator electronic record . Specifically , investigator test hypothesis incorporate largely pre-populated handover checklist transition intraoperative anesthesia care decrease composite mortality serious cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , urinary , infectious complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Anesthesia Care Transition Checklist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The modern team-based approach patient care often involve transition care provider . Critical detail may lose transition , handover , result delay , inefficiency , suboptimal care , even patient harm . The Joint Commission Hospital Accreditation declare communication failure root cause almost two-thirds sentinel event . The World Health Organization similarly list `` communication patient care handover '' one high patient safety initiative . The consequence ineffectual communication may especially detrimental surgery patient often unstable post-handover decision must make quickly accurately . In preliminary study investigator observe 8 % increase odds experience major in-hospital morbidity mortality per intraoperative handover . Checklists use transition care variety area ; orthopedic trauma , urological robotic surgery , emergency department . The field anesthesia also embrace use checklist , especially handover intensive care unit . Post-anesthesia checklist particular focus anesthesia provider recent year . Post-operative checklist clearly enhance information transfer , evaluate use historical control account bias . The anesthesia area lack valid study intraoperative handover . Anesthesia-specific intraoperative handover differ interaction primarily anesthesia provider surgery continue without disruption . To date , one propose checklist intraoperative handover anesthesia provider prospectively evaluate . A randomized study contemporaneous control , utilize anesthesia specific , electronically pre-populated checklist measure objective `` hard '' outcomes address limitation previous study . The investigator propose test hypothesis incorporate electronic handover checklist transition intraoperative anesthesia care reduce serious complication . Specifically , investigator quantify effect handover checklist adverse outcome define composite mortality serious cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , urinary , infectious complication .</detailed_description>
