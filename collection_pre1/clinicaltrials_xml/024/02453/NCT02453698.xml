	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate effect Methylphenidate neural activity underlie inhibitory control error monitor healthy adult . More specifically , investigator aim establish baseline modulatory effect Mehtlylphenidate bottom-up top-down aspect cognitive process . This work understand Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , Methylphenidate , executive functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methylphenidate ( MPH ) stimulant medication commonly use treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . MPH suppresses reuptake dopamine block dopamine transporter , elevate ADHD . However , precise mechanism suppress dopamine transporter activity relieve ADHD symptom fully understood , partly dopamine pathway implicate various process could play role deficit ADHD disorder . MPH-induced dopamine variation extensive effect brain influence various executive function unknown way . Hypotheses : Inhibitory Control : The investigator predict MPH increase top-down activity right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associate response restraint go-phases bottom-up activity caudate right inferior frontal cortex associate response cancellation successful stop trial . A great modulation top-down bottom-up activity would imply selective effect MPH one pathway . Error Processing : The investigator predict MPH increase intensity deactivation bottom-up dopamine pathway error detection ( substantia nigra , dorsal striatum ACC ) , increase intensity deactivation top-down pathway post-error slowing ( caudal OFC , ventral striatum , ventral substantia nigra ) . A great modulation top-down bottom-up activity would imply selective effect MPH one pathway .</detailed_description>
