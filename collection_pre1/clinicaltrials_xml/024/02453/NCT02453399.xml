	<brief_title>Relief Migraine Pain Through Electro Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study gather information regard performance Avital transcutaneous electro stimulation device develop Siano . Electrostimulation form weak electrical pulse arrange specific pattern ( program ) , deliver adhesive electrode attach patient 's skin . A set stimulation program , one placebo , store device memory.The device control wirelessly use dedicate smartphone application . Participants instruct attach activate device onset migraine attack manually adjust stimulation intensity level perceivable painful . Upon activation , program automatically pick execution random order . Randomization perform within subject . Subjects aware execute program . Subjects request refrain use migraine relief drug prior treatment first two hour treat attack . Throughout course electrostimulation , participant request rate migraine pain level via te smartphone application , use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . Overall experimental duration participant determine goal use Avital device 10-20 migraine attack . Data contain activation time , executed program , stimulation intensity user feedback transmit via smartphone central database analysis . All data completely de-identified link unique code assign device . The link participant 's ID code securely maintain research coordinator . Database overseen Siano staff responsible monitoring clinical study . The electronic database use generate outcome measure . In course study investigator obtain control data safety efficacy transcutaneous electro stimulation migraine treatment use Siano develop transcutaneous electro stimulation device .</detailed_description>
