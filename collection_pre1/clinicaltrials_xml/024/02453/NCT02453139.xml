	<brief_summary>Obesity , know associated pro-inflammatory , pro-thrombotic humoral milieu , confers worse prognosis prostate cancer ( PrCa ) . Circulating tumour cell ( CTCs ) identify blood advanced cancer . Their quantitation provide prognostic information . `` Cloaking '' CTCs adherent platelet impede natural killer ( NK ) -cell clearance CTCs circulation , enhance metastatic spread . NK-cell function blood solid organ quantitatively qualitatively reduced obesity . Platelet cloaking may enhance obesity due pro-inflammatory , pro-thrombotic state , may mechanism bad cancer-specific outcome group . Obesity biochemical effect may influence lifestyle change exercise . Physical activity reduces level systemic inflammatory mediator aerobic exercise intervention may represent accessible cost-effective mean ameliorate pro-inflammatory effect obesity . The ExPeCT trial determine prescribe exercise intervention ameliorate degree platelet cloak obese non-obese men advance prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarch hypothesis enhance platelet cloak circulate tumour cell obese men prostate cancer , due increase systemic inflammation , mechanism underlie bad prognosis cancer patient . The investigator aim test follow four hypothesis , divide experimental analytical work four separate project . 1 . Platelet cloak circulate PrCa tumour cell prominent men obesity without 2 . Regular exercise ameliorate platelet cloak 3 . The degree platelet cloak varies level systemic primary tumour inflammation coagulability 4 . Expression obesity-associated lethality gene signature lead variation platelet cloak For first hypothesis , 200 men metastatic PrCa recruit , divide expose non-exposed group base body mass index ( BMI &gt; 25 ) . The objective enumerate CTCs quantify degree platelet cloak expose non-exposed group , draw meaningful comparison two . For second hypothesis , objective determine extent number CTCs degree platelet cloak varies expose non-exposed group follow supervised exercise intervention , compare non-exercised comparison group . The exercise intervention prescribe moderate intensity aerobic exercise supervise per week 3 month complete independently home 3 month . Patients wear Polar heart rate monitor monitor exercise prescription progression . Assessments include blood sampling quality life questionnaire complete baseline , 3 month 6 month . For third hypothesis , objective build serological , haematological immunological picture state systemic inflammation coagulability , degree inflammation within prostate gland . Furthermore , investigator intend correlate compare variable result first second objective , order determine whether number CTCs degree platelet cloak varies change inflammatory / coagulatory milieu . For fourth hypothesis , objective determine whether expression profile number lethality-associated gene , know associated PrCa progression , coagulation stem-cell like phenotype , correlate number CTCs degree cloak platelet . CTC number degree platelet cloaking common denominator anchor four objective together enable comparison .</detailed_description>
