	<brief_summary>This open label phase II study determine safety efficacy novel 3 fraction daily dose regimen accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) early invasive noninvasive breast cancer . The three technique utilize recognize standard option delivery APBI , evidence either technique superior inferior . The APBI technique utilize physician 's discretion base technical consideration , availability treat radiation facility , insurance coverage , well patient preference .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female Age ≥ 50 year diagnosis Grade 13 invasive ductal , mucinous , tubular , colloidal , pure ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) measure ≤ 2cm ( clinical stage T1 ) . Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) + ( ER DCIS meeting eligibility criterion eligible ) Unicentric : Patients microscopic multifocality eligible long total pathologic tumor size &lt; 2cm . Surgical treatment breast must lumpectomy . The final margin resect specimen must histologically free tumor . Pathologically node negative Note : For patient T1a , T1b , T1c invasive breast cancer ( except T1mi ) , axillary staging procedure perform ( either sentinel lymph node biopsy alone axillary dissection axillary node must pathologically negative ) . Patients N0 ( i+ ) tumor sentinel lymph node map dissection ( i.e. , tumor deposit 0.2mm le determine immunohistochemistry hematoxylin eosin stain ) also eligible . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Negative pregnancy test do ≤7 day prior registration , woman childbearing potential . Ability complete questionnaire ( ) assistance . Ability elect radiotherapy care conjunction physician Able willing provide write informed consent Willingness return enrol institution followup ( Active Monitoring Phase study ) . Willing provide tissue blood sample correlative research purpose Willing sign consent onto Mayo Clinic Radiotherapy Patient Outcomes Registry Biobanking study , IRB number 15000136 Any follow study involve therapy know genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect : Pregnant woman Nursing woman Women childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Prior history ipsilateral breast cancer Prior radiation therapy ipsilateral breast thorax Comorbid systemic illness severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study interfere significantly proper assessment safety toxicity prescribe regimen . Active collagenvascular disease , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . Paget 's disease breast Proven multicentric carcinoma ( DCIS invasive ) one quadrant separate 4 centimeter diffuse ( &gt; 1 quadrant ) suspicious calcification Histologic evidence angiolympatic invasion ( ALI ) . Note : Cases term focally suspicious ALI definitive ALI find eligible .
